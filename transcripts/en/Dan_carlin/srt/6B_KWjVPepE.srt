00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,120
What's you're about to hear is part five
of a multipart series on the first world

2
00:00:04,121 --> 00:00:09,121
war.
If you haven't caught the earlier 

3
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:09,121
episodes and you want to know what's 
going on,

4
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:10,600
it might be worth your time to go back 
and listen to them.

5
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,480
If you've already heard them or you 
don't care about stuff like that,

6
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:18,481
then please join us for part five of 
blueprint for Armageddon,

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,650
be some bus seven,
19,

8
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,710
41 date which will live in infamy.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,160
It's

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:36,880
perfect.

11
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,620
The events,

12
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:48,970
the figure out,
Lord,

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,980
from this time and place I take pride in
the words,

14
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:02,150
been the Alina tear down.
Welcome this kind of examination because

15
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:19,950
people have got to know whether or not 
their president question,

16
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:20,950
well,
I'm not a crop.

17
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,370
If we dig deep in our district and our I
don't remember,

18
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,520
but we are not descended from fearful of
man.

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,820
It's hardcore history.

20
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,890
Earlier in this story,
we brought up the often quoted phrase 

21
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:46,040
that one man's terrorist is another 
man's freedom fighter,

22
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,910
and we brought it up in relation to the 
man who actually launched the incident 

23
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:56,891
that sparked the first world war,
the Serbian nationalist Gabriela 

24
00:01:56,891 --> 00:02:00,770
apprenticeship who killed the heir to 
the Austro-hungarian,

25
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:05,771
thrown the archduke Franz Ferdinand,
thereby precipitating the crisis that 

26
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:10,991
actually started the war.
The austro-hungarian saw apprenticeship 

27
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:15,500
unequivocally as a terrorist is Serbian 
nationalist brethren revered him.

28
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,340
In fact,
not that long ago,

29
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:21,490
a statue was unveiled in,
sorry,

30
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:23,570
Eva,
where the assassination happened,

31
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,500
honoring the assassin.
So your view of the motives of these 

32
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,490
people really depends on,
you know,

33
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,540
who's doing the viewing at the time.
Print chip is far from the only figure 

34
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,550
in this story who falls into a similar 
category.

35
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,240
The United States is dealing with one 
themselves.

36
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,110
In 1916,
for example,

37
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:53,111
in January of 1916,
just as the German military is putting 

38
00:02:53,111 --> 00:02:56,261
the finishing touches on what will 
become the quintessentially horrible 

39
00:02:56,901 --> 00:03:01,901
battle of Verdun,
the quintessentially century style 

40
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:05,821
battle,
the killing field created by mass 

41
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:08,170
artillery.
The meat grinder that will be verdun the

42
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,170
United States is attention is taken off 
European affairs by events going on in 

43
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,591
northern Mexico.
Mexico has been convulsed by revolution 

44
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:19,060
since 19.
10.

45
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,420
Northern Mexico often becomes one of 
these hot beds of unrest and 

46
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,410
instability,
and in January 19,

47
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:31,411
16,
gunman waylay a train in northern 

48
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:31,411
Mexico.

49
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,270
Now this is at the tail end of the era 
where train robberies are not uncommon,

50
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:40,560
but these gunman aren't there to rob the
train.

51
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:42,330
In fact,
as they go up and down the aisles,

52
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,290
they leave the Mexican nationals,
the locals alone,

53
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,390
but they pull off every American from 
the train that they find.

54
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:58,350
They find 16 to 18 workers.
Employees have a US corporation 

55
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,930
operating in northern Mexico.
They take these Americans off the train,

56
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:10,370
line them up in front of the tracks,
forced them to strip,

57
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,290
and then execute them.

58
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:18,550
We know this because one of the 
Americans feigned death and got away and

59
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:23,551
told his story.
I believe he said that the bodies were 

60
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:26,311
also mutilated.
This very well may have been an attempt 

61
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:28,030
to provoke a response on the part of 
theU ,

62
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,140
s government,
and if so,

63
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:31,960
the mutilation is just part of adding 
fuel to the fire,

64
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,440
a little something to make the US 
government even angrier at this event 

65
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,790
and things had been escalating to this 
point in northern Mexico for some time 

66
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,030
groups affiliated with these same gunman
had been attacking isolated Americans at

67
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:45,580
murder.
Here,

68
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:47,170
a murder there,
a rape here or there,

69
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:49,810
but this was upping the ante 
significantly.

70
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,770
Nonetheless,
the maneuver accomplished nothing 

71
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,940
concrete of note,
so a couple of months later in March 19,

72
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:05,030
16,
this group of gunmen or outlaws or 

73
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,601
revolutionaries,
if you're looking at it from another 

74
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,851
point of view up the ante again and 
cross the US Mexican border in strength 

75
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,950
more than 100 go after American interest
on the US side of the border,

76
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,360
culminating in that in an attack on a US
city,

77
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,800
Columbus,
New Mexico.

78
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,400
In the middle of the night,
they roar through this town,

79
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,140
shooting,
looting,

80
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,400
killing,
and burning.

81
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,660
18 Americans will be killed.
The town will be burned down and the 

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,050
bandits or terrorists or 
revolutionaries,

83
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:47,650
depending on your point of view,
will escape back into Mexico.

84
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,220
Now,
as a side note,

85
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:55,221
then as now,
Americans are heavily armed people and 

86
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,540
those bandits paid a high price for,
um,

87
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,580
what they did that town,
many more of them died than Americans 

88
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,330
died.
Nonetheless,

89
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,360
the idea that you were safe and 
protected within the confines of the US 

90
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:12,701
borders was shattered in a way that 
hadn't happened since the Apache wars in

91
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:15,260
that region had ended 30 years 
previously,

92
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,140
the attackers have Columbus,
New Mexico.

93
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:23,141
We're affiliated with a Mexican 
revolutionary leader known to history,

94
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:28,751
not his actual name as Poncho via now 
via almost certainly wasn't in Columbus,

95
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,300
New Mexico.
He had been hurt not that long before,

96
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,810
but these gunman were part of his men.
And if you look at this superficially,

97
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:46,090
there's a lot of similarities between 
Poncho via and Osama bin Ladin.

98
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,700
Now,
this is not said to insult Mexican folks

99
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,820
who still in some cases revere Poncho 
via his memory,

100
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:57,821
but it's hard to avoid that,
at least from the American side of 

101
00:06:57,821 --> 00:07:00,161
things.
There are rough analogies that you can 

102
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:00,560
point to,
for example,

103
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,150
like Bin Ladin via had once upon a time 
been a friend,

104
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:10,151
did the United States,
someone we thought we could work with 

105
00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:12,520
and use and an arm and train and help.

106
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,530
In fact,
after that attack in Columbus,

107
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:20,950
New Mexico when it was obvious that some
response had to be put together,

108
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,370
President Woodrow Wilson,
the American leader,

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
launches and expedition,
a military expedition into northern 

110
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,600
Mexico,
sends about 5,000

111
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:35,740
men across the border.
There was a a,

112
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,800
an official leader,
but he wasn't the guy who actually lead 

113
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:40,800
things on the ground.
The guy who led things on the ground was

114
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,580
an American general named John pershing,
who was nicknamed by the way was Black 

115
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Jack and a year before to show you how 
close the United States had been divya 

116
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,250
at one time,
the year before,

117
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,330
pershing launches this expedition to go 
capture this terrorist Poncho via.

118
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,990
He loses his whole family in a terrible 
house,

119
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:06,910
fire.
Pershing's wife and his little girls,

120
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,640
they were little children,
died in the fire,

121
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,690
and as he was wallowing in almost soul 
crushing grief amongst the condolence 

122
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:24,001
letters he received was one from this 
Poncho via person that he would be 

123
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:29,311
chasing about a year later.
There are a lot of interesting things 

124
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,940
that this expedition across the border 
shows,

125
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,740
not just Mexicans,
not just Americans,

126
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,130
but European observers everywhere who 
all throughout this war have wondered 

127
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,520
what the United States is going to do 
and what their capabilities are.

128
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,530
All of a sudden they have a US military 
force in the field to have a look at and

129
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,920
measure up against the standards of 
early 20th century.

130
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,470
And to be honest,
the American endeavor looks like a 

131
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,470
disaster.

132
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,640
It doesn't look a whole lot different 
than efforts 30 years ago to the year 

133
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,390
that were launched to go after the last 
Apache leader to,

134
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,920
you know,
break off theU ,

135
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:17,130
s reservation system with 40 warriors 
and go into some of this same country 

136
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:22,021
that via and his men were hiding in.
It looks like a very similar army.

137
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:28,140
Just add some motor cars,
which is what the US military was 

138
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,161
employing to give them some mobility and
some airplanes that look like they were 

139
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:34,450
invented by the Wright brothers 
themselves.

140
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:37,420
In fact,
the pilots were trained in some cases by

141
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:39,730
Orville and Wilbur Wright.
That's how recent,

142
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:45,300
you know,
airplane development is and the US 

143
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,460
planes are so rickety and so new that 
none of them survived the first week or 

144
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,201
two of operation down there.
One of the more interesting aspects to 

145
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:59,370
the US operations in northern Mexico to 
go get Poncho via is the US doesn't know

146
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:04,371
northern Mexico in their maps are all 
wrong and so they have leading their 

147
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:09,111
army as scouts Apaches,
and these Apache's include allegedly 

148
00:10:11,721 --> 00:10:16,721
some Apache scouts who were amongst the 
Apache Scouts that hunted down Geronimo 

149
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:19,490
30 years before.
In fact,

150
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:22,430
there's quite a connection to a lot of 
these people involved in this conflict.

151
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,740
John General,
John Black.

152
00:10:24,741 --> 00:10:29,120
Jack pershing was a junior officer 
trailing Geronimo.

153
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,980
Thirty years before these events.

154
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:38,090
It's believed that Poncho via wanted to 
get the US to attack northern Mexico and

155
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:43,791
bog them down in this insane country to 
fight in insane terrain,

156
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:49,131
insane weather conditions,
and thereby raise his standing amongst 

157
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:54,231
several revolutionary leaders vying for 
control of the instability in Mexico 

158
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:59,820
that had been going on since the 1910 
revolution began,

159
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,660
but if Europeans already had a stereo,
typical view of the United States is a 

160
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:12,411
nation of cowboys and an army myered in 
an almost old west sort of approach.

161
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,160
The expedition into northern Mexico to 
capture Poncho via did nothing to 

162
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,081
disabuse them of that stereotype to many
European observers.

163
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,480
It wasn't just a frontier army that the 
United States of America looked like 

164
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,161
they possessed.
It was kind of a frontier mentality to 

165
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:37,431
go along with it,
and one of the things that was really 

166
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,670
hard for European planners is that on 
both sides of the war,

167
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:43,671
by the way,
is that it began to look more and more 

168
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:43,800
like the United States was going to play
this huge role in the war.

169
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,980
But what did that even mean?
The United States had never sent over 

170
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,820
lots of men to go fight in some European
war.

171
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,640
It was alien,
the American experience,

172
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:59,641
so would they actually do that?
There were a lot of European observers 

173
00:11:59,641 --> 00:12:00,310
that thought that even if the US got 
into the war,

174
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:03,340
they wouldn't send troops.
Americans don't do that,

175
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,210
and that's part of what makes that pre 
first world war.

176
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,560
United States of America hard for modern
Americans to understand.

177
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,570
You know,
if you know your grandparents,

178
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:16,130
if you're lucky enough to have met your 
grandparents,

179
00:12:16,131 --> 00:12:21,131
you can explain them to other people.
You begin to get a real feel for what 

180
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:25,481
they're about,
even if they're very different than you 

181
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:25,481
are,
but they're real.

182
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:29,410
You can relate to them.
The United States of 1916 is like a 

183
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:29,410
great,
great,

184
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,460
great grandparents.
You can read all about it you want,

185
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:36,461
but those people are different from you 
and you don't understand them and you 

186
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:36,461
never knew them.
You never knew anyone like them.

187
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,800
The modern United States of America is 
the most intervention is great power in 

188
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,450
the world.
In 1916,

189
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,960
it was the opposite and it had a long 
mythology connected to its very founding

190
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:57,990
that reinforced the idea that that's the
way American foreign policy should be 

191
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,010
before the United States could involve 
itself in the first world war.

192
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:08,580
It had to somehow deal with this lasting
legacy dating all the way back to,

193
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,870
you know,
pre-revolutionary days,

194
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:15,871
but why don't you just start with the 
farewell speech of the first American 

195
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:16,480
President,
George Washington,

196
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,610
a speech that was re-read allowed once a
year in patriotic fervor,

197
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:27,790
a speech that told Americans to stay out
of Europe's wars

198
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:35,260
in the middle of his goodbye speech to 
the American people in his resigning 

199
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,110
from public life.
He said,

200
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:41,111
quote,
the great rule of conduct for us in 

201
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:45,791
regard to foreign nations is an 
extending our commercial relations to 

202
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:49,100
have with them as little political 
connection as possible.

203
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,680
So far as we've already formed 
engagements,

204
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,160
let them be fulfilled with perfect good 
faith here.

205
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:59,150
Let us stop.
Europe has a set of primary interest,

206
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,910
which to us have none or very remote 
relation.

207
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:07,210
Hence,
she must be engaged in frequent 

208
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,200
controversies that causes of which are 
essentially foreign to our concerns,

209
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,500
hence therefore it must be unwise in us 
to implicate ourselves by artificial 

210
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,481
ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her
politics were the ordinary combinations 

211
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:22,310
in collisions of her friendships or 
enmities.

212
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:27,670
Our detached and distance situation 
invites and enables us to pursue a 

213
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,430
different course if we remain one people
under inefficient government.

214
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,790
The period is not far off when we may 
defy material injury from external 

215
00:14:36,801 --> 00:14:41,801
annoyance,
when we may take such an attitude as 

216
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:45,011
well,
cause the neutrality we may at any time 

217
00:14:45,011 --> 00:14:47,390
resolve upon to be scrupulously 
respected when belligerent nations under

218
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:52,391
the impossibility of making acquisitions
upon us will lightly hazard the giving 

219
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:57,761
us provocation which we may choose,
peace or war as our interest guided by 

220
00:14:57,761 --> 00:15:02,421
justice shall council.
Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar 

221
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:07,221
situation?
Why quit our own to stand upon foreign 

222
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:07,221
ground?
Why?

223
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:12,200
By interweaving our destiny,
would that have any part of Europe 

224
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,120
entangle our peace and prosperity and 
the toils of European ambition,

225
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,490
rival ship interest,
humor,

226
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:22,550
or caprice.
It is our true policy to steer clear of 

227
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,091
permanent alliances with any portion of 
the foreign world and quote,

228
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,770
when Americans revere those people like 
Demi Gods and that speech has re-read to

229
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:34,440
American school children and re-read 
publicly once a year.

230
00:15:34,441 --> 00:15:38,310
On the anniversary.
You can see that if you were an American

231
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:41,160
who thought that the United States 
should enter the first world war,

232
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,440
you have a lot of mythology to overcome 
a lot of ingrained ideological training.

233
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,190
Unless you think that those are 
revolutionary sentiments.

234
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:56,330
You know from the beginning of a nation.
A lot of times people are very emotional

235
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,670
and sentimental and lofty and 
idealistic.

236
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:01,310
When a nation is founded and that cools 
over time.

237
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,220
Forty five years after Washington gave 
that speech,

238
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:06,260
the current president of the United 
States,

239
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,220
a second generation guy like George w 
dot Bush,

240
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,240
kind of John Quincy Adams gave another 
one of these foreign policy speeches,

241
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,380
coining a famous phrase that Americans 
would use ever since going abroad in 

242
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:28,241
search of monsters to slay the very 
antithesis of the idea that the United 

243
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,400
States government is going to use as the
slogan to get the United States into the

244
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:39,401
first world war.
John Quincy Adams in the middle of one 

245
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:40,190
of his speech is dealing with what the 
country's foreign policy should be.

246
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,640
Forty five years after Washington gave 
his speech said,

247
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:46,670
quote,
speaking about the United States here in

248
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:48,010
the Feminine Pronoun,
by the way,

249
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,720
quote,
wherever standard of freedom and pendens

250
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:55,620
has been or shall be,
unfurled there will her heart,

251
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,720
her benedictions and her prayers be but 
she goes not abroad in search of 

252
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,470
monsters to destroy.

253
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,950
She is the well wisher to the freedom 
and independence of all.

254
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,920
She's the champion and vindicator only 
of her own.

255
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,280
She will recommend the general cause by 
the countenance of her voice and the 

256
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,640
sympathy of her.
Example,

257
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,880
she well knows that by once enlisting 
under other banners than her own were 

258
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,810
they even the banners of foreign 
independence.

259
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,020
She would involve herself beyond the 
power of extrication in all the wars of 

260
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,611
interest and intrigue of individual 
avarice and Vienna ambition which 

261
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:34,210
assumed the colors and you serve 
standard of freedom.

262
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,050
The fundamental maxims of her policy 
would insensibly changed from liberty to

263
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:43,370
force the front lead upon her brows 
would no longer being with the ineffable

264
00:17:43,371 --> 00:17:48,371
splendor of freedom and independence,
but in its stead would soon be 

265
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:52,001
substituted and imperial diadem flashing
and false and tarnished luster.

266
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,900
The murky radiance of dominion and 
power.

267
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,480
She might become the dictate trust of 
the world.

268
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,570
She would be no longer the ruler of our 
own spirit.

269
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,800
And to quote this kind of historical 
legacy of idealism,

270
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,250
this mythology,
if you will,

271
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:10,950
that Americans had reinforced all the 
time,

272
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:15,951
provided a natural counterweight for 
patriots to choose a side that seemed to

273
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:21,390
be opposite of what patriotism normally 
implied in Europe.

274
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,970
Patriotism was a key part of 
nationalism.

275
00:18:23,971 --> 00:18:28,971
It's the grabbing of the flag.
Sometimes I'm pushing your nation's 

276
00:18:28,971 --> 00:18:28,971
glory and and,
and,

277
00:18:28,971 --> 00:18:33,260
and borders farther that was true in the
United States to everybody's human.

278
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:35,370
The same sorts of,
you know,

279
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:40,660
rallying cries,
often work on Americans that work on 

280
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,891
other people,
but you also had this refuge for people 

281
00:18:42,891 --> 00:18:46,161
who were patriotic and who could take an
anti intervention is position and couch 

282
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:50,310
it as much in the flag as those who were
suggesting that real patriots,

283
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,760
you know,
joined up and fought the Spanish in 

284
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:55,760
Cuba.

285
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:55,830
For example,
as Theodore Roosevelt,

286
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:01,310
the former president of the United 
States in and volunteer for that Spanish

287
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,400
American war know,
kept taking the opposite viewpoint that 

288
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,041
the United States of America lived in a 
different time than those founding 

289
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,540
fathers and that real patriotism and 
real men would be ready to join.

290
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:17,541
The first world war in the United States
is looking like a coward by not being 

291
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:21,930
involved with theater.
Roosevelt is not the president in 1916,

292
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,070
but he's needling the guy who is a guy 
from the other party,

293
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:31,071
a Democrat named Woodrow Wilson,
one of the most enigmatic and hard to 

294
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:34,920
get your mind around figures in this 
story.

295
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:41,210
And part of the reason that Wilson is so
hard to figure out is because the 

296
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,991
historians don't agree,
the majority of historians have always 

297
00:19:44,991 --> 00:19:48,921
taken Wilson sort of at face value and 
portray him as one of the most,

298
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:52,650
if not the most idealistic president in 
American history.

299
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,640
A guy who is so peace loving,
he's virtually gone ds and a man who did

300
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:04,491
everything he could to keep the United 
States out of war and to fight for this 

301
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:08,730
wonderful just fair piece afterwards.
That's the sort of the the goodwills and

302
00:20:08,731 --> 00:20:13,731
I divided them into the goodwill Wilson 
and the Evil Woodrow Wilson in terms of 

303
00:20:13,731 --> 00:20:15,180
how some historians see them.
The other historical campus,

304
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:18,030
smaller but very vociferous,
very loud and growing.

305
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,940
And those are the people who for a lot 
of domestic reasons,

306
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:23,220
it should be pointed out,
don't like Woodrow Wilson at all.

307
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,500
And often you know,
a scribe,

308
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:30,000
sinister or venal motives for him doing 
what he was doing.

309
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:35,570
And see a man who wanted to get involved
with the allies who sought piece for his

310
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:41,331
own vainglorious reasons,
who was a schemer and a person who hid 

311
00:20:42,661 --> 00:20:46,440
behind a mask that promised you know,
idealism and peace,

312
00:20:46,441 --> 00:20:48,100
and there were German,
for example,

313
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,820
who were never falling for that story,
that Wilson was some Bambi,

314
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:56,821
deer in the headlights on the world 
stage and always thought that that was 

315
00:20:56,821 --> 00:21:00,331
just a really good mask that his 
machiavellian scheming hid behind making

316
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:01,720
him even more dangerous.

317
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,460
Right?
His disguise was better.

318
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:09,330
Nonetheless.
I'm not going to wait as a fan of 

319
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:09,330
history into which Wilson I believe was 
the real Wilson,

320
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,950
but look at how it adds to the 
uncertainty of the whole thing.

321
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,100
What is this guy all about now?
I personally think that the air of 

322
00:21:17,771 --> 00:21:22,300
mystery that surrounds Woodrow Wilson 
makes him a more interesting character.

323
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:27,301
I mean,
he's a giant enigma that's quickly 

324
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:29,911
becoming perhaps the most important 
single individual in the story by the 

325
00:21:29,911 --> 00:21:31,840
end of 1916.
But you know,

326
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:35,290
I didn't have to live with them to the 
people in this tale.

327
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:37,930
He's not a character.
He's a world leader.

328
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,220
And what the United States does in this 
war might decide the conflict.

329
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:47,430
So the stakes couldn't be higher.
Winston Churchill writing after the 

330
00:21:47,591 --> 00:21:52,591
first world war,
he got a very interesting view on 

331
00:21:52,591 --> 00:21:52,591
Wilson.
It's hard to describe.

332
00:21:52,591 --> 00:21:52,591
You can see he's.
He's.

333
00:21:52,591 --> 00:21:55,990
He's walking on eggshells sometimes,
but he says this guy,

334
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,520
we didn't know anything about him.
I mean,

335
00:21:57,521 --> 00:22:00,580
he comes out of academia basically,
and he says,

336
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:05,581
only in the American system do you get 
these people that can come from totally 

337
00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:07,330
outside politics as complete unknowns.
He goes,

338
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:12,331
in Britain,
such a prime minister would have spent 

339
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,911
years in the,
in the House of Commons or what have 

340
00:22:14,911 --> 00:22:14,911
you,
you know,

341
00:22:14,911 --> 00:22:17,971
working their way up.
They would be in the public eye the 

342
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:19,861
whole time.
They would be a known quantity by the 

343
00:22:19,861 --> 00:22:21,871
time they got the top job.
He marvels at the fact that Woodrow 

344
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:22,960
Wilson is an unknown,
you know,

345
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:27,961
the most powerful man in the United 
States and quickly becoming the most 

346
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:33,001
important single figure in the war.
Churchill writes about Wilson in all his

347
00:22:33,881 --> 00:22:36,940
strength and his weakness in his 
nobility,

348
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
in his foibles.
He was in spite of his long academic 

349
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,391
record and brief governorship and 
unknown and unmeasured quantity to the 

350
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:46,540
mighty people who made him their ruler.

351
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,020
In 1912,
still more was he a mystery to the world

352
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:52,630
at large writing with every sense of 
respect,

353
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,780
it seems no exaggeration to pronounce 
that the action of the United States 

354
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:02,010
with its repercussions on the history of
the world depended during the awful 

355
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:06,211
period of armageddon upon the workings 
of this man's mind and spirit to the 

356
00:23:06,211 --> 00:23:10,240
exclusion of almost every other factor 
and that he played a part in the fate of

357
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:15,241
nations in comparatively more direct and
personal than any other man and quote.

358
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:20,860
That's why we're talking about the 
United States so much in this episode,

359
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:26,910
and one of the other parts of the Wilson
story that are interesting is when you 

360
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,230
get human beings in positions of great 
power and authority,

361
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,680
oftentimes their little quirks or 
idiosyncrasies or characteristics can 

362
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:39,130
make or break history.
I mean,

363
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:42,970
we all have little things about us that 
might be quirky or idiosyncratic,

364
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,620
but because we're not in positions of 
and authority,

365
00:23:45,621 --> 00:23:47,150
they don't really make much of a 
difference.

366
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:52,150
If if adults,
Hitler leaves the military after the 

367
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:55,481
first world war is a decorated corporal 
and goes and opens up a sausage shop in 

368
00:23:55,481 --> 00:24:00,071
Munich,
his quirks and idiosyncrasies and 

369
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,580
characteristics don't make a big 
difference on the world stage.

370
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:03,740
You probably never hear about them.
They only affect,

371
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:08,980
you know the people he has contact with,
but you take that same figure and you 

372
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:13,151
make them the iron fisted dictator of 
one of the Great Twentieth Century 

373
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:17,501
nations on the planet and all of a 
sudden that man's quirks and 

374
00:24:17,501 --> 00:24:19,940
idiosyncrasies and characteristics can 
create a deadly holocaust.

375
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:25,990
Now,
Wilson didn't have those kinds of 

376
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,001
characteristics.
At least I haven't heard that even from 

377
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:30,491
the evil Wilson camp,
but he did have characteristics that 

378
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:33,491
impacted this whole situation.
One was he was almost always convinced 

379
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:36,230
that he was right.
No paraphrasing here,

380
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:41,231
but he said something to the effect of 
once that he felt pity for people who 

381
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:42,260
had different opinions than him because 
he knew they were wrong.

382
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:47,770
You can watch the way he operates in 
government and he's a supremely gifted 

383
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:51,731
politician,
but a lot of times those people are 

384
00:24:51,731 --> 00:24:55,211
unwilling to let other men carry out 
their policies and their programs 

385
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:01,570
because they know they could do it 
better and you can see that from Wilson 

386
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,391
to after the war,
the man is going to become the British 

387
00:25:04,391 --> 00:25:05,090
prime minister.
A guy named David Lloyd.

388
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:10,091
George will have to sit by the French 
military leader on one side and the 

389
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:14,981
president of the United States on the 
other and he said it was like sitting 

390
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:18,011
between Napoleon on one side and that 
was the French leader and Jesus on the 

391
00:25:18,011 --> 00:25:22,631
other.
That was woodrow Wilson and Jesus was 

392
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:26,921
probably more the way Wilson saw himself
is what George was trying to convey than

393
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:32,921
the way others saw him.
Negotiating with a savior can require a 

394
00:25:34,191 --> 00:25:39,191
deft touch and Wilson's demeanor and 
sort of professorial air of superiority 

395
00:25:41,901 --> 00:25:43,310
and that I'm always right.

396
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,640
Kind of save your air about him.
Sometimes rubbed some people the wrong 

397
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,970
way and certainly influenced the way 
that Wilson handled things.

398
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:58,300
And there were several big challenges to
American neutrality that Wilson had to 

399
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,790
deal with and all we're especially acute
in 1916.

400
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:07,810
One involved American lives,
the other involved American money and 

401
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:12,251
the last involved in American election 
start with perhaps the number one most 

402
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:18,670
obvious things,
sucking the United States into the 

403
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,220
whirlpool,
the vortex of the first world war.

404
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,520
And it was something that was so 
obviously doing that you can feel the 

405
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,661
momentum even now reading the history 
books about this sort of slide into a 

406
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:32,630
war because the German's use of this 
thoroughly modern science fiction almost

407
00:26:32,631 --> 00:26:37,631
weapon.
The submarine and the submarine was 

408
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:38,780
creating conditions where a couple of 
Americans here and there,

409
00:26:38,781 --> 00:26:42,200
every now and then we're dying on ships.
Every now and then.

410
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,790
It was worse than when the Lusitania 
went down,

411
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,980
which was a titanic like liner to a 
submarine torpedo.

412
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,530
More than 100 Americans went down with 
that ship.

413
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,280
How long would any nation put up with 
that?

414
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,010
And the problem is is that the US would 
complain.

415
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,680
It works something out with the Germans.
Tensions would drop.

416
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:03,600
And then a month later,
month and a half later,

417
00:27:03,601 --> 00:27:04,710
boom,
it happens again.

418
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:10,110
It's like a sore that kept getting poked
with a needle before it was able to heal

419
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:15,510
and yet we'll send,
kept making the conditions more and more

420
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,960
impossible to fulfill.
So those anti wilsonian historians who 

421
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:20,960
say,
no,

422
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,480
no,
you misunderstand.

423
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:26,481
Wilson was trying to create the 
conditions that the Germans couldn't 

424
00:27:26,481 --> 00:27:29,451
help but violate and then get the United
States into the war and then claim it 

425
00:27:29,451 --> 00:27:31,020
was foist upon the Americans.
For example,

426
00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:35,010
Wilson at one point in his 
administration with high minded rhetoric

427
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:40,011
and speeches,
was defending the right of an American 

428
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:40,011
passenger.

429
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:43,800
And remember Americans could travel on 
American ships or neutral ships and and,

430
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:48,801
and,
and at certain times the German's had 

431
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:49,110
had sworn they wouldn't go after those,
but Wilson was defending the right of an

432
00:27:49,111 --> 00:27:53,340
American to travel on a British ship or 
a French ship,

433
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,400
right?
A belligerent ship and defending their 

434
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,371
right to travel on a belligerent ship,
even if it was carrying munitions and 

435
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:05,520
defending their right to travel on a 
belligerent ship carrying munitions that

436
00:28:05,521 --> 00:28:09,060
also was carrying defensive guns on it.
That could hurt a submarine.

437
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:14,790
That's when the Germans would throw up 
their hands and say that to them.

438
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:16,890
Wilson didn't look like an honest 
broker.

439
00:28:16,891 --> 00:28:19,230
That's the kind of guy you're going to 
trust with peace.

440
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,520
I mean,
look,

441
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:25,521
he did and their attitude was he doesn't
hold the British to any of these same 

442
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:25,980
rules.
He's trying to hold us to.

443
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,650
The British had a blockade going.
They didn't use submarines.

444
00:28:28,651 --> 00:28:33,651
They use minds and they would mind the 
North Sea and they create these zones 

445
00:28:33,651 --> 00:28:34,770
where they would stop every line that 
they could get their hands on,

446
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:37,080
make it go to a British port,
search it,

447
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:42,260
you know,
decided was contraband and Wilson and 

448
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:42,810
his administration were pretty darn 
quiet about that.

449
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,900
The occasional protest and nothing more 
to the Germans.

450
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:49,590
This looked like rank hypocrisy and to 
anti wilsonian historians.

451
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:54,710
To them,
it looks like a perfect example to show 

452
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:58,070
that really these ideals that Wilson 
professed were very conveniently ignored

453
00:28:58,741 --> 00:29:03,741
when they ran against what he wanted.
There were other complications that 

454
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:08,540
affected what he wanted to.
One had to do with perhaps the,

455
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:12,750
the most ancient of motivations of all 
economic ones.

456
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:19,030
The United States was making a killing 
on the first world war by 1916,

457
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:24,071
pardon the pun,
and it began to affect its entire 

458
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:29,201
outlook toward the conflict.
It's one of the longest term impacts,

459
00:29:30,391 --> 00:29:32,790
by the way,
are the first world war that the results

460
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,980
of which we live with everyday in our 
modern world,

461
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,260
but it's sort of sinks beneath the 
radar.

462
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:42,261
It's a lot easier to understand the 
submarine warfare question than it is 

463
00:29:42,261 --> 00:29:45,250
the economic transfer of wealth from 
Europe to the United States.

464
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:51,730
This war was so total in its stakes that
these,

465
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:56,780
the,
the sides fighting it found no good 

466
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,490
reason not to spend every bit of 
capital.

467
00:29:57,491 --> 00:29:58,600
They had to win it.

468
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:05,290
When Britain started this war in 1914,
she was the richest country in the 

469
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:08,681
world.
It was not long after the era where the 

470
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:09,890
phrase the sun never sets on the British
empire was in vogue.

471
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,400
The British empire controlled directly 
or indirectly about a third of the 

472
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,271
planet.
She was wealthy and she'd been sucking 

473
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:19,760
up a lot of the wealth of Europe for 100
years.

474
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:24,560
During Europe's most dominant time 
period on the world stage.

475
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:29,561
The era of colonies and Post Napoleonic 
splendor,

476
00:30:29,901 --> 00:30:31,310
right?
The Victorian Age,

477
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,220
and yet when 19,
14 started,

478
00:30:34,221 --> 00:30:39,221
the British didn't just have their own 
bills to pay in this most expensive of 

479
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:40,010
all human conflicts.
They underwrote their dominions.

480
00:30:40,011 --> 00:30:42,050
The Canada's the Australia is the New 
Zealand's.

481
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:47,350
They underwrote countries like Italy and
paid for almost all their costs during 

482
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:47,690
the war.
The Russians to it.

483
00:30:47,691 --> 00:30:50,810
A lot of other small powers.
The amounts of money that we're changing

484
00:30:50,811 --> 00:30:51,080
hands.

485
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,990
I've seen so many different attempts to 
come up with it.

486
00:30:53,991 --> 00:30:56,420
All you have to know though is it's 
ungodly.

487
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:02,140
At one point it was like $75,
million dollars a week in 1916.

488
00:31:03,411 --> 00:31:04,490
Money.
I mean it's,

489
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:09,520
it's incredible.
The wealth transfer and when Britain 

490
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:09,520
started buying stuff from places like 
the United States,

491
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,320
when the war started,
they used cash and gold.

492
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:17,890
By 1916.
We're talking about credit and debt and 

493
00:31:17,991 --> 00:31:22,991
if you wanted to think of New York as 
being like a giant vacuum cleaner with 

494
00:31:22,991 --> 00:31:26,831
the sucking hose and in London just 
sucking out a hundred years of 

495
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:31,151
civilizational wealth acquirement it's 
not a bad image in four years.

496
00:31:33,561 --> 00:31:38,561
The center of world banking as we sit in
an earlier episode is transferred from 

497
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:43,061
London to New York,
same thing for the center of World 

498
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:45,640
Trade,
and all of a sudden by 1916,

499
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:51,150
Wilson is acquiring a huge amount of 
power because the United States is the 

500
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:54,670
banker and these people are beginning to
owe it money.

501
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,460
The British realized that at the same 
time,

502
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,340
historian justice don't key rights,
um,

503
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:07,310
about Wilson's new ability because he 
controls the purse strings of the allied

504
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:11,880
side in this war to dictate any sort of 
outcome he might want.

505
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,260
He writes,
quote,

506
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:18,250
if Wilson desire to force the allies to 
the peace table,

507
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:21,850
the opportunity had come and he knew it.
On October third,

508
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:26,910
1916,
a British interdepartmental conference 

509
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:28,990
noted the nation's utter dependence upon
American munitions,

510
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,790
steel,
foodstuffs,

511
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:31,930
oil,
wheat,

512
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,580
cotton,
and lubricants.

513
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,090
We're the United States to engage in 
economic reprisals.

514
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,360
Britain's war effort would practically 
of the 5 million pounds sterling needed 

515
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,111
to prosecute the war reported a 
government economist John Maynard 

516
00:32:47,111 --> 00:32:47,450
Keynes.
Later that week,

517
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:52,570
2 million must come from North America,
quote in a few months time claimed the 

518
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:57,341
treasury official,
the American public will be in a 

519
00:32:57,341 --> 00:33:00,011
position to dictate to this country on 
matters that affect us more nearly than 

520
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:00,500
them.
And quote,

521
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,500
the author continues,
quote Reginald Mckenna,

522
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,490
Chancellor of the Exchequer concurred 
with canes telling the cabinet.

523
00:33:07,491 --> 00:33:11,120
In late October quote,
by next June or earlier,

524
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,360
the president of the American republic 
will be in a position if he wishes to 

525
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,950
dictate his own terms to us and quote.

526
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,000
The author says,
at the end of December,

527
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:22,690
Mckenna told an American journalist that
Wilson could quote,

528
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:26,660
force the allies to their knees anytime 
in a moment.

529
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:32,610
And quote the United States in late 1916
is like a bank in Europe and especially 

530
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,800
Great Britain who was the financial 
underwriter of the whole allied war 

531
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,941
effort.
Basically owes is the bank money that 

532
00:33:42,941 --> 00:33:46,271
gives the bank a lot of power,
but there's an old line in banking that 

533
00:33:47,031 --> 00:33:48,830
if you owe the bank a little bit of 
money,

534
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:52,220
it's the bank who has the power.
But if you owe a bank a lot of money,

535
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:57,730
that power goes back to the person that 
owes the money because the bank now has 

536
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,841
a vested interest in seeing that that 
person survives so that they can pay 

537
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:05,831
them back.
The United States is beginning to worry 

538
00:34:05,831 --> 00:34:09,020
about what happens if we can't sell this
war material anymore,

539
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,750
or if we can't get paid for the credit,
we're loaning out.

540
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,040
The US has had a very uncomfortable sort
of prosperity descend on it in the past 

541
00:34:18,621 --> 00:34:23,621
two years.
In 1914 when the first world war breaks 

542
00:34:23,621 --> 00:34:26,801
out,
the American economy is not doing well 

543
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:26,801
at all.
By 1916,

544
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:31,240
halfway through the year,
the American economy is humming along 

545
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:31,240
nicely.
Thank you.

546
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:36,340
Some historians have actually called the
United States a nation of war 

547
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:36,800
profiteers.
At this point,

548
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,920
if if Wilson was successful in,
in creating a negotiated peace at the 

549
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,640
end of 1916 somehow,
and you wanted it at that point,

550
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:46,490
declare the winner in the first world 
war.

551
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,880
Do you know which two powers I'd 
nominate it nominate Japan and the 

552
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,590
United States and the Japanese hardly 
fought in the war at all.

553
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:59,680
And by the end of 1916,
the United States hadn't fought in the 

554
00:34:59,680 --> 00:34:59,750
war at all.
Those are the victors.

555
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:04,220
The Japanese get involved in 1914 for 
purely opportunistic reasons.

556
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:09,460
They can take over all the German 
holdings in their neck of the woods and 

557
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:09,460
the Germans can't do anything.

558
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,510
So you get all this territory for 
basically nothing.

559
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:17,210
The United States is selling stuff,
amazing amounts of stuff.

560
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:21,170
The both sides need everything in.
The Americans will sell to anybody,

561
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:23,090
but they can't get their stuff to 
Germany.

562
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,520
They still made loans and tried to get 
stuff to them.

563
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,220
But by and large,
the British blockade had shut that down,

564
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:30,350
but you could still trade with the 
British.

565
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,380
And we did.
And the idea that that trade might 

566
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:40,361
somehow go away,
began to filter into the halls of 

567
00:35:40,361 --> 00:35:41,760
government the prosperity that this war 
brought.

568
00:35:41,761 --> 00:35:44,460
The United States created another vested
interest.

569
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:48,610
And there are economic historians and 
historians who look more at,

570
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:53,620
um,
economic motivations for why countries 

571
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,091
do things that pointed this as the most 
important undercurrent of why the war 

572
00:35:56,091 --> 00:35:58,650
was really going the way it was.
Now,

573
00:35:58,651 --> 00:36:01,260
there's another reason too,
and this is a very pedestrian,

574
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:06,830
but woodrow Wilson in 1916 was an 
American president that faced an 

575
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,840
election campaign,
and this is where the,

576
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:15,230
the real uniqueness of the American 
situation has demonstrated what does the

577
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:18,990
president do,
who's running for reelection,

578
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,260
and the big elephant in the living room 
situation is this war in Europe when 

579
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,240
he's facing an electorate made up of 
immigrants,

580
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,860
of people on both sides of that 
conflict.

581
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:36,860
In the old world,
historian David Stevenson does a great 

582
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,390
job breaking down,
you know,

583
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,900
the ethnic makeup of the United States 
and showing you all these weird problems

584
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:47,901
that the United States would have if it 
got into this conflict that other 

585
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:48,240
nations wouldn't.
For example,

586
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:53,241
he points out that large chunks of the 
United States is made up of immigrants 

587
00:36:53,241 --> 00:36:55,470
from some of these countries.
The two main groups that are,

588
00:36:55,471 --> 00:37:00,471
that are problematic for anyone who 
wants to talk about siding with the 

589
00:37:00,471 --> 00:37:04,881
allies in this first world war,
our German Americans and Irish 

590
00:37:04,881 --> 00:37:06,270
Americans.
Here's what Stevenson writes,

591
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:11,540
quote,
support for American neutrality was 

592
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,421
strongest in the interior and especially
the middle West where the German 

593
00:37:14,421 --> 00:37:19,280
Americans were concentrated,
of whom only an insignificant minority 

594
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,140
favored intervention on the side of the 
central powers of a US population.

595
00:37:22,141 --> 00:37:25,020
In 1910 of $92 million,
he writes,

596
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:29,400
two and a half million had been born in 
Germany and five point seven,

597
00:37:29,401 --> 00:37:33,960
$8 million had one or two German born 
parents in 1917,

598
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,660
522 German language.

599
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,420
Newspapers and journals were published 
in the United States.

600
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,320
And German Americans were the largest 
ethnic group in Baltimore,

601
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,150
Pittsburgh,
Chicago,

602
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,920
Detroit,
Los Angeles,

603
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,990
and San Francisco.
And quote,

604
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:53,400
he then goes on to talk about Irish 
Americans who,

605
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,460
and we didn't even get into this as,
as a person of partly Irish American 

606
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:00,770
descent.
I would have just gone off on,

607
00:38:00,771 --> 00:38:01,770
on the whole,
uh,

608
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,520
Irish uprising,
the Easter uprising that happened,

609
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,800
uh,
during this conflict of which the 

610
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:10,800
Germans may have had a role.
Uh,

611
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,600
the British considered this an 
especially nasty stab in the bank back 

612
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:19,111
since it happened.
During wartime reacted by killing a lot 

613
00:38:19,111 --> 00:38:19,350
of Irish or it depends on if you're 
British or not,

614
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,500
killing Irish leaders in the uprising,
infuriating a Americans of Irish 

615
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:27,120
descent,
of which there were a ton,

616
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,430
and so if you're a politician like 
Woodrow Wilson,

617
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:34,730
you have to deal with the fact that you 
have a ton of voters who were the only 

618
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:37,870
people that can keep you in power,
who are really interested in not joining

619
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:40,690
the side of the allies maybe or anyone.

620
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,560
The slogan for the Nineteen 16 campaign 
that's most remembered on the Woodrow 

621
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,640
Wilson side is the one that said,
quote,

622
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:53,970
he kept us out of war and quote.
That was a slogan that appealed to most 

623
00:38:55,601 --> 00:39:00,601
Americans.
Wilson's peace oriented Secretary of 

624
00:39:00,601 --> 00:39:01,270
State,
William Jennings.

625
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:06,190
Bryan had said at one point that New 
York and the major newspapers want war.

626
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:11,260
The rest of the country wants peace,
and if you're an American planner,

627
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:16,500
it's interesting how many times you can 
open up the history books and see 

628
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,711
references to the uncertainty of what 
these large immigrant descendant 

629
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:24,880
populations would do if the US joined 
the allied side in the war.

630
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:28,480
If you have two point $5,
million Americans born in Germany,

631
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,840
what are they going to do when war 
breaks out or these potential 

632
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,691
terrorists,
and so it became quite an interesting 

633
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:40,021
issue before the conflict involved the 
United States as to whether or not the 

634
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:44,940
United States was unified and the idea 
that it would go fight on any side in 

635
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:44,940
this conflict.

636
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,130
Now what do you do if you're one of 
these American figures,

637
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:53,370
perhaps one of the top politicians who 
wants the United States to get into the 

638
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:57,811
first world war?
What's your strategy for dealing with 

639
00:39:57,811 --> 00:40:00,550
these Americans who don't want to go?
Who Want to stay neutral?

640
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,360
It may be a huge majority of the country
during this time period.

641
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:09,690
If you're a politician and you're used 
to sort of putting your finger in the 

642
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:09,970
wind and going in the direction that 
people want to go,

643
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:12,490
but they don't want to go in the 
direction you want to go.

644
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:17,820
You know?
What's your strategy for dealing with 

645
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,771
that?
The strategy of several of the top 

646
00:40:19,771 --> 00:40:22,501
political figures in this period was to 
play the Super Patriot card and to 

647
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:26,821
accuse Americans who disagreed with the 
idea of getting into the war as being 

648
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,700
disloyal mean.
Take for example,

649
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,420
the former president Theodore Roosevelt 
in 1916.

650
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:39,460
Roosevelt is not running for president,
but he's campaigning and helping the guy

651
00:40:39,461 --> 00:40:42,340
who is from his own party,
the Republican that's challenging.

652
00:40:42,341 --> 00:40:45,160
Woodrow Wilson in the November 1916 
elections.

653
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:51,690
Now,
Roosevelt is in an interesting position 

654
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,611
here.
He desperately wants to get into the 

655
00:40:53,611 --> 00:40:56,131
first world war.
He thinks it's cowardly that the US is 

656
00:40:56,131 --> 00:40:59,101
staying out.
He has publicly slamming Woodrow Wilson 

657
00:40:59,101 --> 00:41:00,670
from pillar to post for not wanting to 
get involved in the conflict.

658
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,630
He compares him on the campaign trail to
punch US pilot.

659
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:09,631
In fact,
he says Wilson's neutrality is worse 

660
00:41:09,631 --> 00:41:09,631
than ponchos pilot.
Remember Pontius pilot?

661
00:41:09,631 --> 00:41:14,490
He's the Roman official who in the Bible
Sentences Jesus to be crucified.

662
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,760
That's a pretty good political slam at 
the president,

663
00:41:18,761 --> 00:41:23,761
isn't it?
But then Roosevelt makes a point to go 

664
00:41:23,761 --> 00:41:26,230
after what at the time were referred to 
as hyphenated Americans.

665
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:31,620
You know,
people who had a hyphen between their 

666
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,470
description of their nationality,
German hyphen Americans,

667
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:37,100
Irish Hyphen Americans,
Jewish Hyphen Americans,

668
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:42,230
and there was a feeling amongst a lot of
Americans that these people weren't real

669
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:47,231
Americans,
that they had conflicted loyalties and 

670
00:41:47,231 --> 00:41:50,681
there was also this idea that you had to
have 100 percent loyalty to the United 

671
00:41:50,681 --> 00:41:55,300
States and any consideration with what 
the ancestral home might want was 

672
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,550
equivalent in Roosevelt's own words to 
being a moral trader.

673
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:04,980
And so how do you deal with the fact 
that you want the United States to do 

674
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,430
something that most Americans don't want
it to?

675
00:42:05,431 --> 00:42:10,431
Do?
You Slam as traitorous those who oppose 

676
00:42:10,431 --> 00:42:14,061
it.
Now Wilson was in a bit of a different 

677
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:15,140
position because not only many 
historians think,

678
00:42:15,141 --> 00:42:16,970
did he not want to get in the war?
Maybe,

679
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:20,840
but he certainly had a public persona of
not wanting to get into the war,

680
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,830
but Wilson didn't like anyone who 
disagreed with them.

681
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:31,190
And you can see Wilson's attitude about 
those who would oppose his policies even

682
00:42:31,501 --> 00:42:36,501
in peace time,
in his response to a telegram he 

683
00:42:36,501 --> 00:42:37,920
received from an Irish American.
There's that hyphenation,

684
00:42:37,921 --> 00:42:39,090
right?
Irish hyphened,

685
00:42:39,091 --> 00:42:41,870
American leader.
In September 19,

686
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:45,120
16,
a guy named Jeremiah O'leary and o'leary

687
00:42:45,121 --> 00:42:48,150
was telling Wilson something that's,
that's perfectly logical.

688
00:42:48,151 --> 00:42:53,151
He's explaining to him that all of these
moves that seem to lean toward the 

689
00:42:53,151 --> 00:42:54,660
allied side of the war are going to be 
issues in the campaign,

690
00:42:54,661 --> 00:42:59,661
right?
There's nothing controversial about 

691
00:42:59,661 --> 00:42:59,661
that.
O'Leary's cable said,

692
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:02,601
quote,
your foreign policy is your failure to 

693
00:43:02,601 --> 00:43:03,720
secure compliance with all American 
rights.

694
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:08,040
You're leaning and see with the British 
Empire your approval of war loans.

695
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,180
The ammunition traffic are issues in 
this campaign and quote,

696
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,360
most American political figures would 
understand that.

697
00:43:15,361 --> 00:43:20,361
That's just someone from the opposition 
explaining that that's how the American 

698
00:43:20,361 --> 00:43:20,550
political system works.
There's nothing wrong with that,

699
00:43:20,551 --> 00:43:25,020
especially not in peace time.
Wilson wrote back to Jeremiah O'leary,

700
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:27,510
quote,
your telegram received.

701
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,720
I would feel deeply mortified to have 
you or anybody like you vote for me 

702
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,630
since you have access to many disloyal 
Americans and I have not.

703
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:40,780
I will ask you to convey this message to
them and quote.

704
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,760
In other words,
to simply oppose Woodrow Wilson's 

705
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,890
policies in peace time doesn't make you 
part of the loyal opposition.

706
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:55,220
It makes you disloyal.
What is a president who feels that peace

707
00:43:55,611 --> 00:43:58,830
time opposition to peacetime policies is
disloyal?

708
00:43:58,831 --> 00:44:02,670
What's a guy like that going to do when 
it's no longer peace time?

709
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,520
Well,
here's a little preview to think about.

710
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:11,300
We still have laws on the books that 
were currently enforcing and using in 

711
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,781
the war on terror that our president 
Wilson's response to critics who 

712
00:44:15,061 --> 00:44:20,061
addressed him negatively in war time.
Unless you think that this is an 

713
00:44:21,261 --> 00:44:23,660
overreaction though or maybe misplaced

714
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:28,690
priorities,
it's worth noticing that in late 1916,

715
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:34,080
there are several belligerence in this 
who are most threatened not by foreign 

716
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,770
armies defeating their armies on the 
battlefield,

717
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:43,430
but by their own populations collapsing 
from within morally or in terms of their

718
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,700
unity and support for the government.
In an era where more and more of the 

719
00:44:50,761 --> 00:44:55,761
armies of these modern 20th century 
states could take a punch and stay on 

720
00:44:55,761 --> 00:44:57,450
the battlefield fighting year after 
year,

721
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:02,960
the Chink in the national armor for some
of these states was proving to be the 

722
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:08,241
home front and nowhere by the way,
do you see a better example of the 

723
00:45:08,821 --> 00:45:13,821
sweeping away of the 19th century 
mentality than in how the Home Front is 

724
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:18,831
viewed?
The Home Front of course as a shorthand 

725
00:45:18,831 --> 00:45:19,750
word for the people back living their 
civilian lives and you know,

726
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,430
supporting the war economy and helping 
to make munitions and all the stuff that

727
00:45:23,431 --> 00:45:25,170
helps support those troops at the front.

728
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:30,120
In the 19th century in Europe's more 
genteel sort of era,

729
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:35,390
there were all sorts of peace 
conventions and laws of war meetings to 

730
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:37,500
do,
to help spare civilians and keep them as

731
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:39,720
far away from the suffering of war as 
possible.

732
00:45:39,721 --> 00:45:42,120
That was considered to be a civilization
will advance.

733
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:48,350
It's interesting and and telling I think
to watch that sort of genteel peace time

734
00:45:49,051 --> 00:45:54,051
mentality crash into the rocks of 
reality that are the 20th century where 

735
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:58,800
all of those rules look like rainbows 
and Unicorns.

736
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:02,220
I mean from another time we're gassing 
each other with know insecticide,

737
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:07,230
human humic decide can we say that you 
design something you use to spray on 

738
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:08,940
human beings like their aunts,
you know,

739
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:13,941
there go the 19th century genteel 
conventions right there and the same 

740
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:14,810
applied to civilians.
We have the Germans,

741
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,110
you know,
using zipline raids to drop bombs on,

742
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,560
on British cities.

743
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:24,560
I mean there goes those 19th century 
conventions right there and the German 

744
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:24,560
bombers who do it,
you know,

745
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,370
site this idea that everyone's a 
combatant.

746
00:46:26,371 --> 00:46:31,080
Now if the home front is a legitimate 
target in total war,

747
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,800
then so are the civilians going about 
their daily lives in places like Germany

748
00:46:34,801 --> 00:46:35,670
and Austria,
Hungary.

749
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,190
When the British cut off trade to those 
places,

750
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:43,191
they begin to do the equivalent of put 
an entire nation or an entire alliance 

751
00:46:45,631 --> 00:46:49,140
under siege.
And one British official actually said,

752
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:51,390
you know,
what's the difference between,

753
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:53,070
you know,
putting the city under siege,

754
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:55,920
which has been done throughout history 
in the civilian population in that,

755
00:46:55,921 --> 00:46:59,430
besides that he always suffers and 
putting a nation under siege.

756
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:05,600
The British clamped down this blockade 
at the beginning of the war by the 

757
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,901
middle and latter parts of Nineteen 
Sixteen at Longterm Anaconda like 

758
00:47:08,901 --> 00:47:10,470
strategy really begins to bite.

759
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:16,610
And part of the reason why is these 
societies are already straining to the 

760
00:47:16,681 --> 00:47:20,550
maximum to just keep their militaries in
the field.

761
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:25,670
And I think it's easy to forget exactly 
what the strain on these societies,

762
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,560
you know,
was because you look at,

763
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:32,630
we know we've often compared the size of
these modern armies to what Alexander 

764
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:34,030
the great conquered the known world with
back in,

765
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:36,010
you know,
the three thirties bce.

766
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:41,260
Alexander the Great is a core in one of 
these modern armies.

767
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:46,500
Listen to what a German army corps of 
which they had dozens in the army 

768
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:51,840
requires to sustain itself.
Imagine an ancient economy trying to 

769
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,630
provide this.
This is from a holder,

770
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:58,400
her vague and his book on the First 
World War quote,

771
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:02,650
the army consumed copious amounts of 
food and fodder,

772
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:07,890
a single core of 35,000
soldiers monthly devoured 1 million 

773
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:11,350
pounds of meat,
600,000

774
00:48:11,351 --> 00:48:14,290
loaves of bread,
189,000

775
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:17,680
pounds of fat,
or he says 242,000

776
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:21,640
pounds of canned meat and 121,000
pounds of Marmalade.

777
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,790
And he says 73,000
pounds of coffee.

778
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:30,090
It's horses.
Her Irving says needed 7 million pounds 

779
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,540
of oats and more than 4 million pounds 
of Hay.

780
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,120
The 18th army corps,
he says,

781
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:39,121
for example,
estimated that it needed 1000 wagons 

782
00:48:39,121 --> 00:48:41,680
extending for nine miles to haul.
It's monthly allotment of bread.

783
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:45,280
It's butchers slaughter at 1,320
cows.

784
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:49,000
1,100
hogs and 4,158

785
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:51,430
sheep every month.
Taken as a whole.

786
00:48:51,431 --> 00:48:55,640
He says,
the German army weekly demolished $60,

787
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:00,650
million pounds of bread,
131 million pounds of potatoes and 17 

788
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:06,390
million pounds of meat.
No one in the government or the general 

789
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:07,630
staff he writes,
had given serious considerations to such

790
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:12,560
mammoth needs for a period of four years
and quote no,

791
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,730
no one saw that coming.
Someone from the ancient world,

792
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:19,120
I mean this could never have been 
sustained before the modern era,

793
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:24,540
but sustaining it took all of those 
necessary foodstuffs out of the civilian

794
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:31,770
populations mouths and they were 
beginning to starve because of it.

795
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:38,670
The winter of 1916,
1917 will be remembered by Germans 

796
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:42,781
forever as the turnip winter,
and that's the winter where the hunger 

797
00:49:42,781 --> 00:49:47,410
blockade really bit historian Eric Dorn.
Burroughs writes,

798
00:49:47,411 --> 00:49:52,411
quote as 1916,
turn to 1917 caloric intake,

799
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,480
which had already begun to fall in late 
1914.

800
00:49:55,690 --> 00:50:00,690
Sled,
do about a third of prewar consumption 

801
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:00,690
levels,
money connections,

802
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:02,110
and the black market help the lucky 
ones,

803
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,690
but even the upper crossed suffered.
Now,

804
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:07,870
quoting a noble woman,
we are all gaunt and bony.

805
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:10,840
Now.
We have dark shadows around our eyes and

806
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:14,590
our thoughts are chiefly taken up with 
wondering where our next meal will be.

807
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:20,070
Bros continues,
quote poor had almost disappeared from 

808
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:21,640
dinner tables in restaurants where crow 
was now served,

809
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,910
milk was reserved almost exclusively for
young children,

810
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,340
butter and sugar could be purchased only
in very small quantities.

811
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:33,590
Eggs were rationed to two per person per
month and turnips and Rutabagas had 

812
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:38,081
begun to replace potatoes and quote,
Bros goes into a couple of reminisces 

813
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:41,960
from Germans about what those tasted 
like and then says,

814
00:50:41,961 --> 00:50:43,790
quote,
inevitably,

815
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:48,791
as nutrition levels fell,
bodies to come to a variety of ailments 

816
00:50:48,791 --> 00:50:49,130
like rickets,
scurvy,

817
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:51,140
dysentery,
tuberculosis,

818
00:50:51,141 --> 00:50:56,141
and influenza.
Estimates place the number of blockade 

819
00:50:56,141 --> 00:50:59,321
related deaths by war's end at 730,000,
which makes popular outrage,

820
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:01,960
understandable and quote.

821
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:09,430
Now,
as with everything in the first world 

822
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:09,430
war,
there are historical dissenters who will

823
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:13,151
challenge every aspect of what's known 
as the hunger blockade affecting the 

824
00:51:13,151 --> 00:51:14,780
central powers.
But nonetheless,

825
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,910
the important thing to understand is 
that it.

826
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,960
It creates a dynamic in this conflict 
that forces the German side to do 

827
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:28,181
something.
They're the ones continually getting 

828
00:51:28,181 --> 00:51:29,840
less food.
Their adversaries,

829
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:33,140
the British and the French do not have a
food insecurity problem.

830
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:38,740
That dynamic forces the Germans to do 
something to change their situation or 

831
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:39,200
they'll just strangled to death.
I mean,

832
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:43,400
if you're already living through what 
Germans are calling the turnip winter in

833
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:47,690
1916 and 1917,
what are they gonna call the next winter

834
00:51:47,691 --> 00:51:52,691
of 1917 and 1918.
You don't have to be a genius to see 

835
00:51:52,691 --> 00:51:56,090
that you now have to do something to 
change the state of affairs.

836
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,180
German public opinion begins to demand 
it.

837
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,960
Now I should point out that that just 
pretty much makes them the equal of all 

838
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,381
the other populations of all the other 
belligerent seemingly doesn't seem like 

839
00:52:10,391 --> 00:52:14,500
anyone's particularly happy with the way
their government is prosecuting the war,

840
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:17,050
regardless of which country you're 
talking about,

841
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:22,051
at least amongst the major states.
In Britain at the end of 1916,

842
00:52:22,741 --> 00:52:27,741
there government falls and the new prime
minister who arises is the very 

843
00:52:28,541 --> 00:52:33,541
embodiment of what voters would vote for
if they wanted to shake things up and 

844
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:35,890
get somebody different in there.
His name is David Lloyd.

845
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,120
George usually just called Lloyd George,
Georgia.

846
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:44,340
Feisty Welshman have a much more working
class background than you normally see 

847
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:47,170
in these sorts of positions.
Might be exactly what you know,

848
00:52:47,171 --> 00:52:50,890
the average dissatisfied with the way 
the war is going British citizen wanted.

849
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:57,300
Now it is a little interesting that only
a couple of weeks before Lloyd George 

850
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:00,991
gets the job,
he's recorded as having said about the 

851
00:53:00,991 --> 00:53:04,651
allies in Britain.
We've lost this war and now he's in 

852
00:53:05,291 --> 00:53:10,291
charge of Britain's war effort.
It's also interesting to note that you 

853
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:12,070
could tell how up in the air,
the outcome of the first world war is in

854
00:53:12,071 --> 00:53:17,071
1916,
where you can find leading figures on 

855
00:53:17,071 --> 00:53:18,070
both sides who think their side has lost
the war.

856
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:22,450
Nonetheless,
the French also get into the game.

857
00:53:22,451 --> 00:53:27,451
Nineteen 16 has been a terrible year for
them to just as it has been for the 

858
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:29,820
British,
and they finally find the courage to get

859
00:53:29,821 --> 00:53:33,920
rid of their longtime military leader,
the legend Joseph Jaffra.

860
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:38,700
He's been living off the fumes of his 
reputation from the battle of the Marne.

861
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:43,701
A long time,
I think it's safe to say been 

862
00:53:43,701 --> 00:53:43,701
underperforming and the French finally,
they can't fire him.

863
00:53:43,701 --> 00:53:48,651
He's too much of a legend,
but they finally sort of kick him 

864
00:53:48,651 --> 00:53:50,400
upstairs and promote them to a ceremony 
of poster and replace him with the first

865
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:55,401
new French leader since the war started,
a guy named and he's Al the Russian 

866
00:53:55,981 --> 00:53:59,280
population and public opinion,
which isn't really supposed to have much

867
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:01,940
of a sway,
supposedly because they live in a,

868
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:05,670
in a strange sort of autocracy with a 
part time legislature,

869
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:10,930
um,
but they're making their feelings known 

870
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:10,930
to more on that in a minute.

871
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:15,140
And in Germany,
the population just wants a way out of 

872
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:18,981
this trap.
Some people would like to see efforts 

873
00:54:18,981 --> 00:54:20,430
made towards figuring out a way out of 
the war,

874
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:24,660
which they have people who say this in 
all the belligerent countries,

875
00:54:24,661 --> 00:54:29,661
but you have to be careful.
A little while ago we talked about 

876
00:54:29,661 --> 00:54:32,541
Woodrow Wilson,
suggesting that people who might oppose 

877
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:36,141
his policies were disloyal.
He could get you thrown in the jails in 

878
00:54:36,141 --> 00:54:38,430
a lot of these belligerent countries if 
you appear to be disloyal.

879
00:54:38,431 --> 00:54:41,070
So too much peace talk could get you in 
a lot of trouble.

880
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:46,310
Nonetheless,
there was a body of German public 

881
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:46,310
opinion that was pushing for another 
outcome.

882
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:49,170
They wanted their government to take the
gloves off,

883
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:55,050
stop playing nice with the adversary.
They wanted their government to unleash 

884
00:54:56,971 --> 00:55:01,530
the submarines and to heck with what the
Americans would do to some Germans.

885
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:06,530
The American policy looked to be a very 
conniving way to simply deny Germany the

886
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:09,540
use of the submarines.
If you make the rules too restrictive,

887
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:14,630
and in the Americans case,
the rule basically was that an American 

888
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:17,760
traveling on some ship gives it some 
magical protection simply by stepping on

889
00:55:17,761 --> 00:55:18,840
board.
You can't sink that ship.

890
00:55:18,841 --> 00:55:23,841
Now there's an American on it that 
pretty much nullifies the submarine for 

891
00:55:23,841 --> 00:55:27,981
Germany at all,
but if that's the only way you see a 

892
00:55:27,981 --> 00:55:30,360
chance to end the war with the German 
victory over the British,

893
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:35,630
what does that mean?
Can you let the Americans hamstring you 

894
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:36,810
like that?
Added that.

895
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:41,811
The fact that a lot of Germans don't 
really see the Americans is all that 

896
00:55:41,811 --> 00:55:43,530
neutral already and think that maybe 
Britain could be defeated in four or six

897
00:55:43,531 --> 00:55:46,020
months before the Americans have a 
chance to do much of anything.

898
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:53,170
Add to that.
The fact that when public opinion veers 

899
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:56,021
in that direction,
there are Germans in the military high 

900
00:55:56,021 --> 00:55:59,141
command,
a majority of them that were already 

901
00:55:59,141 --> 00:56:00,941
thinking that themselves now they have 
public opinion on their side unleashed 

902
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:04,241
the submarines,
but what if the Americans come in the 

903
00:56:04,241 --> 00:56:04,241
war?

904
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:09,190
There were German leaders though that 
didn't like this choice,

905
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:13,460
wanted to find another option rather 
than use the subs,

906
00:56:13,461 --> 00:56:18,461
get the United States into the war.
Chief among them was the chancellor of 

907
00:56:18,461 --> 00:56:19,730
Germany,
the top political guy.

908
00:56:19,731 --> 00:56:21,080
His name was Beth manhole.
Vague,

909
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:23,830
and we've discussed him before.
This is all,

910
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:24,040
by the

911
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,090
way,
very controversial,

912
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:26,740
very complicated,
very convoluted.

913
00:56:26,741 --> 00:56:29,380
You're getting the Dan Carlin a 
condensed,

914
00:56:29,381 --> 00:56:34,381
potentially unreliable version of this,
but it's a fascinating time in the 

915
00:56:34,381 --> 00:56:39,001
conflict because the politicians led by 
whole vig think they find a way to throw

916
00:56:39,821 --> 00:56:44,821
a monkey wrench into that terrible 
choice that the allies of sort of 

917
00:56:44,821 --> 00:56:46,450
foisted the Germans on with the hunger 
blockade and everything else.

918
00:56:46,451 --> 00:56:50,710
They've got to make a move so they make 
a very unexpected one.

919
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,170
On December twelfth,
1916,

920
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,440
Beth manhole,
vague and the Germans announced that 

921
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:03,030
they are prepared to enter into 
negotiations to end the war.

922
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:11,550
Now it should be pointed out that such 
calls for peace and discussions about 

923
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:15,841
peace had gone on since the war started.
Woodrow Wilson had stepped up pretty 

924
00:57:15,841 --> 00:57:18,250
much right at the beginning and said,
I'll mediate anytime you want.

925
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:23,380
There were attempts by both sides in the
war to try to make a separate peace with

926
00:57:23,381 --> 00:57:24,990
somebody else and maybe get,
you know,

927
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,580
one of the allies of,
of your enemy to drop out of the war,

928
00:57:27,581 --> 00:57:30,730
but those are peace terms just to get an
edge in the conflict.

929
00:57:30,731 --> 00:57:35,731
They're not peace terms to end the war.
The Germans were making the first 

930
00:57:35,731 --> 00:57:39,600
apparently serious,
certainly public offer to sit down and 

931
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,370
start talking about the issues that kept
the conflict going.

932
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:48,660
This was a huge shock,
not exactly to the Wilson 

933
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:51,460
Administration.
They'd been getting some information fed

934
00:57:51,461 --> 00:57:54,100
through some back channels that the 
Germans might be ready to do this,

935
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:59,430
but the Americans thought that they were
going to unleash this big piece 

936
00:57:59,430 --> 00:57:59,430
proposal.

937
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:03,360
When the Germans do it,
they preempt woodrow Wilson's version 

938
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:03,360
and he has to rush this out.
You know,

939
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,950
about a week later,
a little bit miffed that the Germans 

940
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:09,100
stole his thunder a little bit,
but all of a sudden in December 19,

941
00:58:09,101 --> 00:58:14,101
16 after this horrible year,
there were a piece proposals on the 

942
00:58:14,101 --> 00:58:16,330
table and it puts everybody into a 
really uncomfortable position.

943
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,810
Now the Germans had taken a real chance,
by the way,

944
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:24,370
by trying this peace proposal route.
If this is a high stakes card game and I

945
00:58:24,371 --> 00:58:26,320
often think of the war and in terms like
that,

946
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:31,620
the Germans,
because of the hunger blockade and 

947
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:33,511
everything else are forced to play a 
card and everyone thinks they're going 

948
00:58:33,511 --> 00:58:33,511
to play that really high risk,
high reward,

949
00:58:33,511 --> 00:58:37,951
dangerous card.
They have the unrestricted submarine 

950
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:41,101
warfare card.
Instead they play a potentially equally 

951
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:42,730
perilous card,
but one that no one's expecting.

952
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:47,731
They play the race card,
but the peace card can blow up in your 

953
00:58:47,731 --> 00:58:47,731
face if you don't play it.

954
00:58:47,731 --> 00:58:50,610
Definitely case in point,
what are your enemy's gonna?

955
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:55,620
Think?
When you become the first power to come 

956
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:55,620
forward and start talking about stopping
the war,

957
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,670
they're gonna.
Think you need to.

958
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,220
What's more?
There's a danger.

959
00:59:00,221 --> 00:59:05,221
Your own people might think that too,
and you spend a lot of effort in this 

960
00:59:05,221 --> 00:59:06,850
war to stiffen their backbone and keep 
their resolve in place.

961
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:12,240
How much are you going to undercut it if
you become the first power to seek 

962
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,181
peace?
So this whole thing has to be worded 

963
00:59:15,181 --> 00:59:18,781
very carefully and it is,
but almost in such a way to give your 

964
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:22,070
gift to give you as you're moving

965
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:27,070
your neck between the humanitarian side 
of the German chancellors proposals and 

966
00:59:27,891 --> 00:59:30,950
the side,
this filled with overwhelming hubris.

967
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:36,490
The Germans talk about what this was 
doing to civilization and how they'd be 

968
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,330
willing to get into conversations about 
ending it,

969
00:59:38,331 --> 00:59:40,670
but that they're still invincible than 
they're gonna win the war and they don't

970
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:44,370
need to do this and what would the terms
be on the other side?

971
00:59:44,371 --> 00:59:49,371
Maybe you could say that allies,
historians have argued about the motives

972
00:59:50,041 --> 00:59:52,680
behind this ever since,
but the truth of the matter is,

973
00:59:52,681 --> 00:59:57,681
if you look at this like a card game,
there were some good reasons for the 

974
00:59:57,681 --> 01:00:01,221
Germans to play that piece card.
Whether or not it was realistic and 

975
01:00:01,221 --> 01:00:02,670
whether or not the other side accepted 
it,

976
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:07,140
and some historians say this was what it
was intended to do the whole time.

977
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:12,590
Provide some diplomatic cover for the 
start of the unleashing of the 

978
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:14,520
submarines to go and say,
hey,

979
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:17,340
we'll talk about peace.
Then when it's rejected.

980
01:00:17,341 --> 01:00:20,790
Being able to turn around to your own 
people and say,

981
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,440
you know,
you better give up those hopes.

982
01:00:22,441 --> 01:00:24,000
Have an easy piece.
We just tried.

983
01:00:24,001 --> 01:00:25,800
They won't do it.
This is a fight to the end,

984
01:00:25,801 --> 01:00:30,801
stiff in yourself and also to show the 
world including the neutrals and 

985
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:34,341
including the people on the other side 
of the wars population that we're not 

986
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:35,790
the ones keeping this carnage going.
It could have been over,

987
01:00:35,791 --> 01:00:40,791
but your side wants to keep fighting it.
Most especially is an attempt to maybe 

988
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:45,250
influence public opinion in the neutral 
countries,

989
01:00:45,251 --> 01:00:46,990
especially the most important neutral 
country.

990
01:00:46,991 --> 01:00:51,991
The United States which has so many 
German Americans in it that there are 

991
01:00:51,991 --> 01:00:55,570
more than 520 German language newspapers
as we said.

992
01:00:56,020 --> 01:01:01,020
What do you think the editorials are 
going to be in those newspapers after 

993
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:03,640
Germany makes a peace proposal and the 
allies swatted down?

994
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:10,160
That's going to put some pressure on the
US government to stay out of the war to 

995
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,730
and that's going to influence American 
public opinion over who the bad guys and

996
01:01:11,731 --> 01:01:16,731
who the good guys are.
That may have been the overriding 

997
01:01:16,731 --> 01:01:17,730
intention of this German piece effort,
but nobody knows.

998
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:22,970
It may have been a serious attempt to at
least start negotiations going and to 

999
01:01:23,881 --> 01:01:27,270
take a position that didn't make you 
seem to vulnerable at the outset.

1000
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:28,890
The Germans picked the right time to do 
it.

1001
01:01:28,891 --> 01:01:32,190
It was right after the capital of 
Romania fell to the central power,

1002
01:01:32,191 --> 01:01:36,510
so were they're negotiating from a 
position of strength here and the allies

1003
01:01:36,511 --> 01:01:39,600
swatted down.
They have to.

1004
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:46,680
The problem with asking these powers to 
state publicly what their war aims are 

1005
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:51,630
in order to create a piece is to show 
that the war aims of these powers have 

1006
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:56,311
gotten so out of hand that they bear no 
resemblance to anything that could be 

1007
01:01:56,311 --> 01:02:00,451
negotiated as historian Gwynne Dyer road
in as we may have quoted already on this

1008
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:01,820
program,
quote,

1009
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:07,230
what the governments of Europe who found
themselves trapped in the first total 

1010
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:10,621
war discovered to their dismay,
was that if the means used to fight the 

1011
01:02:10,621 --> 01:02:12,490
war,
our total then so must be the ends.

1012
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:17,790
It was almost impossible to stop short 
of total victory for one side and 

1013
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:21,901
unconditional surrender for the other 
and to quote the old territorial 

1014
01:02:23,730 --> 01:02:27,750
exchanges and the paying of reparations 
and the,

1015
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:31,800
you know,
giving up or acquiring of colonies was a

1016
01:02:31,801 --> 01:02:36,801
19th century sort of war aim.
It's sounded out of place in the 20th 

1017
01:02:36,801 --> 01:02:41,391
century.
If the British or the French or the 

1018
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:41,391
Germans or anyone had said that their 
was involved,

1019
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:46,280
a little change,
a territory and a little reparations 

1020
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:49,191
money or what have you,
it would have seemed so out of 

1021
01:02:49,191 --> 01:02:51,531
proportion to the cost that there would 
be a real danger that the public would 

1022
01:02:51,531 --> 01:02:56,481
think that what the country was fighting
for wasn't worth what the public was 

1023
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:56,481
paying for it.

1024
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:02,980
In addition to that,
of course there were some craven 

1025
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:05,420
territorial ambitions involved and no 
one wanted to state those.

1026
01:03:05,421 --> 01:03:10,421
In fact,
both sides had promised other people's 

1027
01:03:10,421 --> 01:03:12,170
territories to allies of theirs.
For example,

1028
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:16,970
the Italians were promised territory 
from the Austrian Hungarian Empire.

1029
01:03:16,971 --> 01:03:21,971
Once the war was over,
the British couldn't very well say that 

1030
01:03:21,971 --> 01:03:25,040
was a war aim and still not look like 
cynical gamesman in this war.

1031
01:03:25,041 --> 01:03:30,041
When everyone,
by the way on all these sides is a 

1032
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:30,980
cynical games win,
but you can't show that to the public.

1033
01:03:30,981 --> 01:03:35,981
What's more?
The idea of war aims that stopped short 

1034
01:03:35,981 --> 01:03:39,401
of defeating the enemy unconditionally 
clashed with your propaganda.

1035
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:45,790
This is a war that's using such 20th 
century ideas as a war to end all wars 

1036
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:52,070
and a war to make the world safe for 
democracy.

1037
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:56,510
It's not a war to acquire a few colonies
on the Mediterranean and some oil in the

1038
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:59,120
Middle East and the breakup of the 
Austrian Hungarian Empire.

1039
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:04,630
It's a war for these high minded ideals.
The problem is as if your propaganda 

1040
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:07,430
portrays the Germans as the second 
coming of the Hmong goals will actually,

1041
01:04:07,431 --> 01:04:12,431
the huns is the word the propaganda used
and they're baby killers and nurse 

1042
01:04:12,431 --> 01:04:16,100
executioners and none rapers and all the
things that propaganda makes them out to

1043
01:04:16,101 --> 01:04:18,530
be.
How can you possibly sit down and sign a

1044
01:04:18,531 --> 01:04:21,530
piece of paper to compromise with them 
and have peace again,

1045
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:27,940
when the Vatican was a at this time 
trying to help create the conditions 

1046
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:32,861
where peace could happen.
The Vatican kept telling the powers to 

1047
01:04:32,861 --> 01:04:35,030
live up to those prewar agreements to 
make war less horrible,

1048
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:40,510
and they were saying that they were 
favoring this not because they were 

1049
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:45,010
idealists,
but because if these powers kept doing 

1050
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:46,640
everything in there,
you know might to destroy one another.

1051
01:04:46,641 --> 01:04:49,610
They were going to hate each other so 
much that there was going to be no space

1052
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:52,910
and mutual respect left to carve out a 
piece later,

1053
01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:58,580
the Germans were no happier by the way 
to state their war aims publicly for the

1054
01:04:58,581 --> 01:05:01,970
exact same reasons.
Now,

1055
01:05:01,971 --> 01:05:06,971
there was an implied threat included 
when the Germans came forward with this 

1056
01:05:06,971 --> 01:05:10,421
attempt to get negotiations started and 
the implied threat was if negotiations 

1057
01:05:10,821 --> 01:05:15,821
didn't happen in weren't fruitful,
they would play the unrestricted 

1058
01:05:15,821 --> 01:05:19,571
submarine warfare card.
The peace negotiations are over by the 

1059
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:23,260
end of January,
in the middle of January.

1060
01:05:23,261 --> 01:05:24,430
Actually,
we're on January 20th.

1061
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:29,910
Wilson makes a famous speech,
a speech where he calls for peace 

1062
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:31,090
without victory

1063
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:38,100
in his so called Peace Without victory 
speech on the 22nd of January when 

1064
01:05:38,141 --> 01:05:41,020
essentially he already knew that it 
wasn't going to happen.

1065
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:46,050
Wilson lays down the kind of peace that 
Europe will have to broker to end the 

1066
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:47,560
first world war.
If it's to be a lasting peace.

1067
01:05:47,561 --> 01:05:50,830
It can't be one of those pieces.
You know where the knife is turned in.

1068
01:05:50,831 --> 01:05:54,730
One side is left hating the other.
When you think about how the first world

1069
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:58,330
war ended and how it's sowed the seeds 
for the Second World War,

1070
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:03,840
Wilson sounds like nostradamus was some 
of the things he says in this part of 

1071
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,310
the speech where he talks about,
you know,

1072
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:06,760
having to have this kind of peace.
He says,

1073
01:06:06,761 --> 01:06:11,761
quote,
I am seeking only to face realities and 

1074
01:06:11,761 --> 01:06:15,190
to face them without soft concealments 
victory would mean peace forced upon the

1075
01:06:15,191 --> 01:06:18,790
loser of Victor's terms imposed upon the
vanquished.

1076
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:22,180
It would be accepted in humiliation,
under duress,

1077
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:25,630
at an intolerable sacrifice and would 
leave a sting,

1078
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:30,810
a resentment,
a bitter memory upon which terms of 

1079
01:06:30,810 --> 01:06:30,810
peace would rest,
not permanently,

1080
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:36,030
but only as upon quicksand.
Only a piece between equals can last 

1081
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:40,830
only a piece.
The very principle of which is equality 

1082
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:41,350
and a common participation in a common 
benefit.

1083
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:45,040
The right state of mind,
the right feeling between nations,

1084
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,880
it is necessary for a lasting peace,
as is a just settlement,

1085
01:06:48,881 --> 01:06:53,050
a vexed questions of territory or of 
racial and national allegiance

1086
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:59,180
end quote,
so he's not only calling for a piece 

1087
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:03,670
where nobody can claim a victory.
We just stopped fighting and begin 

1088
01:07:03,801 --> 01:07:08,801
negotiating for a postwar world in which
Wilson and envisions a new international

1089
01:07:10,941 --> 01:07:15,941
global structure to enforce global peace
and harmony so that we never have a 

1090
01:07:17,781 --> 01:07:18,890
first world war.
Again.

1091
01:07:18,891 --> 01:07:23,891
As I said,
for those historians who suggests that 

1092
01:07:23,891 --> 01:07:25,100
Wilson is out to make Wilson the biggest
historical figure he can,

1093
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:28,310
that would be a heck of a legacy if he 
could pull that off,

1094
01:07:30,610 --> 01:07:32,980
but instead,
within a couple of months,

1095
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:38,470
the United States will be in the war and
from the allied perspective,

1096
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:43,950
not a moment too soon.
The end of 1916,

1097
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:49,280
early 1917,
and we've been spending quite a bit of 

1098
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,371
time setting this period in the war up,
but this period in the war is probably 

1099
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:56,430
the most important six months in the 
last hundred years.

1100
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:03,490
People talk about the first world war is
this transformative moment and the 

1101
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:04,220
aftereffects that were living with,
you know,

1102
01:08:04,221 --> 01:08:09,221
even now all around us,
but the most transformative moment in 

1103
01:08:09,221 --> 01:08:13,250
that conflict is what's about to happen 
now and you know,

1104
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:16,790
I can't help but find some sort of 
analogy approach to looking at it,

1105
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:21,791
but I mean it's like we have this tree 
and they've been shopping at it for two 

1106
01:08:21,791 --> 01:08:23,540
years and at the end of 1916 and finally
the tree falls over.

1107
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:27,260
Winston Churchill says three ingredients
acting together,

1108
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:31,310
create what he calls the second climax 
of the war.

1109
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,940
In this period we've dealt with two of 
those ingredients,

1110
01:08:34,941 --> 01:08:37,670
the Americans and the submarine 
question.

1111
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:42,890
The third ingredient involves Russia.
Up till now,

1112
01:08:42,891 --> 01:08:45,470
I think it's pretty obvious in this 
episode we've been dealing with what you

1113
01:08:45,471 --> 01:08:50,471
could safely call the first rate powers 
the countries that were at the top of 

1114
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:53,150
everything when the war started.

1115
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,260
The rich,
powerful,

1116
01:08:54,261 --> 01:08:55,700
cohesive,
unified,

1117
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:57,590
you know,
top of the Line States,

1118
01:08:57,591 --> 01:08:58,730
the Francis,
the Britains,

1119
01:08:58,731 --> 01:09:03,731
the Germany's.
But if they're worn down by this many 

1120
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:08,360
years of this war to this point,
to where they are now,

1121
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:12,560
where the Germans are undernourished,
for lack of a more provocative term,

1122
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:18,200
what must be the situation that the 
countries that weren't first rate powers

1123
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:23,201
in the war started?
The ones that had challenges and we're 

1124
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:24,590
struggling in various areas.
How are two years of war treating them?

1125
01:09:26,030 --> 01:09:31,030
Well,
the Italians have opened disagreements 

1126
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:32,640
about peace in their government.
Um,

1127
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:34,160
in,
in the trenches,

1128
01:09:34,161 --> 01:09:39,161
there are pamphlets distributed by 
socialists that say next winter,

1129
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:44,620
not another man in the trenches.
The generals are not very pleased with 

1130
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:45,680
that,
but it's hard to blame the Italians.

1131
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:49,580
They were on like their 10th or 11th 
battle of the [inaudible] river fighting

1132
01:09:49,581 --> 01:09:52,370
over this torture risk,
mountainous terrain,

1133
01:09:52,371 --> 01:09:53,630
which creates an environment.

1134
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:54,420
You know,
it's,

1135
01:09:54,421 --> 01:09:58,880
it's a little teeny horrible war in and 
of itself with all these unique things.

1136
01:09:58,881 --> 01:10:00,260
I mean,
just to give you one example,

1137
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:03,280
in the mountain war that the Italians 
are fighting with the Austro-hungarian,

1138
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:06,230
when shells hit,
they're all carved into rock.

1139
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:07,400
I mean,
instead of trenches,

1140
01:10:07,401 --> 01:10:11,330
a lot of times they have blown out like 
chasms for cover,

1141
01:10:11,331 --> 01:10:14,600
but when the shells hit the rocks,
the rocks just splinter,

1142
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:17,240
creating like a secondary amount of 
shrapnel.

1143
01:10:17,241 --> 01:10:22,241
That's just horrifying.
And then when you get wounded your way 

1144
01:10:22,241 --> 01:10:22,241
up at six,
7,000

1145
01:10:22,241 --> 01:10:24,000
feet and you got to be brought down 
through mountaineers,

1146
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:26,220
Alpine conditions to the nearest 
waystation,

1147
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,640
they,
they still find frozen things up there.

1148
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:32,660
Even today,
it's a horrible conflict and by 1960 and

1149
01:10:32,661 --> 01:10:37,661
the Italians are on like their 10th or 
11th version of it and all they have to 

1150
01:10:37,661 --> 01:10:38,870
show for it is more and more dead 
people.

1151
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:44,080
They wouldn't be human if they weren't 
starting to get a little fed up with 

1152
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:44,080
this.
In fact,

1153
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,370
that just puts them on par with how it 
seems the populations of all the 

1154
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:50,720
belligerent countries are doing now.
How's Austria Hungary doing?

1155
01:10:50,721 --> 01:10:52,250
Remember,
they're the ones that you know,

1156
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:53,810
kind of where we're at.
Ground Zero.

1157
01:10:53,811 --> 01:10:58,811
When this whole war got started,
they're the ones who had the archduke 

1158
01:10:58,811 --> 01:11:02,171
that got himself assassinated.
They're the ones that sent that 

1159
01:11:02,171 --> 01:11:04,010
uncompromising letter to the Serbians.
They're the ones that sparked this war.

1160
01:11:04,011 --> 01:11:05,540
How are they doing?
Well,

1161
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:08,750
I bet they wish they hadn't.
They're in terrible shape.

1162
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:11,690
The venerable emperor that had ruled 
there for so long,

1163
01:11:11,870 --> 01:11:15,330
the benign face of stability had finally
died to be,

1164
01:11:15,331 --> 01:11:16,850
um,
you know,

1165
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:21,860
succeeded by the next emperor who's a 
much younger man and who looks at his 

1166
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:26,391
country and says to the Germans,
this war has to end in 1917 when 

1167
01:11:26,391 --> 01:11:27,720
Austria,
Hungary is worse than done

1168
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:33,240
this new emperor.
During this coming year,

1169
01:11:33,241 --> 01:11:38,140
we'll go behind the Germans,
back to the allies reportedly and try to

1170
01:11:38,141 --> 01:11:41,610
sort of sell them out and the Germans 
find out about it and then they're never

1171
01:11:41,611 --> 01:11:43,470
going to take their eyes off Austria 
hungry again.

1172
01:11:43,471 --> 01:11:44,630
All of a sudden,
you know,

1173
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,890
these brothers in arms don't trust each 
other anymore.

1174
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:50,190
And it was a very interesting move that 
a lot of people have talked about.

1175
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:54,810
It's almost like world war one's version
of Rudolf Hess flying to Great Britain,

1176
01:11:55,020 --> 01:12:00,020
you know,
to make a separate piece for Nazi 

1177
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:00,020
Germany and the Second World War.
It's just this weird little endeavor.

1178
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:02,280
And all it does is earn Austria,
Hungary.

1179
01:12:02,281 --> 01:12:06,960
Germany's Ms Dot Trust,
and then you have the Russians.

1180
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,560
Now,
the Russians from the very start of this

1181
01:12:11,561 --> 01:12:16,561
war,
even before this war for a very long 

1182
01:12:16,561 --> 01:12:17,170
time,
have been this contradiction in power.

1183
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:22,680
In one sense,
they are massively powerful in a 

1184
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:23,920
military sense.
Theoretically they are terrifying

1185
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:30,160
and yet they are at the same time,
so fatally flawed in the underpinnings 

1186
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:36,070
that anything Russia's doing in this,
we're always seems to be like writing 

1187
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:38,690
some rail or or walking a tight rope and
and disaster loomed at any moment.

1188
01:12:38,691 --> 01:12:42,080
It just,
it was an unsteady sort of situation.

1189
01:12:42,620 --> 01:12:47,620
There's a story that sort of shows this,
this contradiction in terms the military

1190
01:12:47,751 --> 01:12:49,550
leader of the Russian military leader,
bruce seal off.

1191
01:12:49,551 --> 01:12:52,990
He'll have an offensive named after him 
in 1916.

1192
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,990
We talked about it nowhere near as much 
as it deserves in the last program.

1193
01:12:57,890 --> 01:13:02,890
This once again,
push the Russians out there in a good 

1194
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:03,110
light,
shows you what they can do when they get

1195
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:06,020
their act together and they are 
devastating.

1196
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,760
Seven hundred and 50,000
casualties on the Austria.

1197
01:13:08,761 --> 01:13:11,600
Hungarian army,
I mean essentially mortally wounded than

1198
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:14,390
it is frightening what the Russians can 
do,

1199
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:19,840
you know when things go the right way.
But Priscilla of tells a story that 

1200
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,370
shows you just how fatally compromised 
everything is.

1201
01:13:22,371 --> 01:13:23,960
You know,
how rotten the insides are.

1202
01:13:23,961 --> 01:13:26,390
He says,
at the height of this offensive,

1203
01:13:26,391 --> 01:13:30,770
when everything's going so well,
he's receiving unsigned letters from his

1204
01:13:30,771 --> 01:13:34,670
own soldiers telling him that if the 
fighting doesn't stop soon,

1205
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:36,260
they're going to kill him.

1206
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:44,210
Russia has been having internal problems
for decades.

1207
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:47,400
Now.
The current Tsar,

1208
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:49,800
Nicholas the second,
uh,

1209
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:51,600
the czar desire is not even his right 
name.

1210
01:13:51,601 --> 01:13:56,601
He's the emperor of Russia.
The czar is the old name that goes back 

1211
01:13:56,601 --> 01:13:59,541
hundreds of years,
but they still call them that because 

1212
01:13:59,541 --> 01:14:00,300
that's essentially what the office still
is in his name,

1213
01:14:00,301 --> 01:14:03,210
his official long title that says he's 
the autocrat.

1214
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:04,580
And,
uh,

1215
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:09,680
even if the Russian doom has been given 
one percent and the czar still has 99 

1216
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:12,340
percent of the power,
he's a,

1217
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:16,840
an example of the old world at its most 
royal.

1218
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:22,980
And yet he knows how frightfully fragile
the underpinnings are.

1219
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:28,280
When he was emir adolescent,
he saw his grandfather carried into the 

1220
01:14:28,981 --> 01:14:33,300
royal palace with his legs torn to 
shreds,

1221
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:35,730
his groin gone,
his stomach ripped out,

1222
01:14:35,970 --> 01:14:40,970
and his face mangled,
and he is bleeding out on the royal 

1223
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:42,960
carpet and the royal family,
including Nicholas.

1224
01:14:42,961 --> 01:14:47,961
The second,
the man who will be Nicholas the second 

1225
01:14:47,961 --> 01:14:48,300
watch their grandfather die.
It takes about 15 minutes

1226
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:54,520
he'd been killed in an assassination.
Another one of these stories where you 

1227
01:14:55,551 --> 01:14:59,780
know the czar is out in his bulletproof 
sled and I am a bomber.

1228
01:14:59,781 --> 01:15:04,781
Throws a bomb.
It sounds a little like the whole Sarah 

1229
01:15:04,781 --> 01:15:04,781
Gevo thing that kicked off the first 
world war.

1230
01:15:04,781 --> 01:15:05,540
A bomber throws a bomb,
the bomb goes off,

1231
01:15:05,541 --> 01:15:08,600
kills people who are not the target.
The target comes out.

1232
01:15:08,601 --> 01:15:13,601
In this case,
the czar comes out to look around and 

1233
01:15:13,601 --> 01:15:16,031
there's another bomber in the crowd.
Supposedly desire at the time had said 

1234
01:15:16,031 --> 01:15:16,031
something about,
you know,

1235
01:15:16,031 --> 01:15:19,100
thank God that nothing happened.
And the other assassins as he's throwing

1236
01:15:19,101 --> 01:15:21,680
the bomb and him saying it's a little 
too early to thank God,

1237
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:27,220
boom.
And he bleeds out in the royal palace 

1238
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:30,371
floor while the czar who will be 
commanding Russia as the autocrat in the

1239
01:15:30,561 --> 01:15:34,640
first world war as a 13 or 14 year old 
boy watches.

1240
01:15:34,641 --> 01:15:39,641
He knows how dangerous the job is,
and he knows that there's a violent 

1241
01:15:40,851 --> 01:15:45,851
current of rottenness that opposes his 
system and he's dealing with it all the 

1242
01:15:46,221 --> 01:15:51,221
time.
One of the things that makes this story 

1243
01:15:51,221 --> 01:15:55,881
so interesting though is when you're 
dealing with one person with almost 

1244
01:15:55,881 --> 01:15:57,360
total power,
as we said earlier,

1245
01:15:57,690 --> 01:16:02,690
their little idiosyncrasies make a big 
impact on history.

1246
01:16:03,870 --> 01:16:05,490
In the case of Nicholas,
the second,

1247
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:08,070
the autocrat of all the Russians,
right?

1248
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,880
His idiosyncrasies involve some things 
that I think most people out there who 

1249
01:16:15,241 --> 01:16:18,900
have children can at least relate to a 
little bit of.

1250
01:16:20,620 --> 01:16:25,620
It's interesting that there's a part to 
this story that just has a personal 

1251
01:16:26,051 --> 01:16:28,990
tragedy wrapped up in it.
I mean,

1252
01:16:28,991 --> 01:16:33,991
this is an example why you can't reduce 
history to some sort of mathematical 

1253
01:16:33,991 --> 01:16:37,250
equation or some sort of predictable set
of rules are.

1254
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:39,400
I mean there are human beings involved 
here.

1255
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:43,360
In the case of the Tsar.
It's a fascinating story.

1256
01:16:43,361 --> 01:16:44,950
The man,
just so you know,

1257
01:16:44,951 --> 01:16:49,951
I mean this is how Europe was.
This is the old Europe that's being 

1258
01:16:49,951 --> 01:16:52,411
destroyed.
He's the first or second cousin with 

1259
01:16:52,411 --> 01:16:55,410
everybody.
He's the first cousin with the King of 

1260
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:59,261
England.
He's the second cousin with the emperor 

1261
01:16:59,261 --> 01:16:59,510
of Germany.
I mean he's related to everybody and his

1262
01:16:59,511 --> 01:17:03,050
wife is the first cousin of the King of 
England.

1263
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:08,051
I mean a little incestuous maybe,
but that explains why the czar and his 

1264
01:17:11,041 --> 01:17:16,041
wife more than her in a second,
who only have one son give birth to a 

1265
01:17:16,351 --> 01:17:21,351
son who's a hemophiliac.
It runs in the family Queen Victoria,

1266
01:17:22,461 --> 01:17:23,600
who sort of the,
the,

1267
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,480
the descended that all these people can 
trace their heritage back.

1268
01:17:26,481 --> 01:17:28,370
You said that this did not run in her 
family,

1269
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:34,000
but it seemed to.
Victoria of course was German and her 

1270
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,461
roots,
so it was the czar's wife has Arina 

1271
01:17:38,461 --> 01:17:38,461
Alexandra.

1272
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,960
Both of them loved each other,

1273
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,580
and I say this because you know,
you would think today we'll.

1274
01:17:44,581 --> 01:17:45,960
Of course they did,
but listen,

1275
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:48,510
this is an era where,
especially amongst nobility,

1276
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:53,660
you often had very political marriages.
You also had these very old fashioned 

1277
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:54,780
things that were very common back then 
where the husband and wife really didn't

1278
01:17:54,781 --> 01:17:56,460
love each other and the husband was out,
you know,

1279
01:17:56,461 --> 01:18:00,240
with all the girls all at it wasn't like
that with Nicholas and Alexandra.

1280
01:18:00,241 --> 01:18:02,460
This is what this was a love story and 
it really was,

1281
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,910
and not just between the two of them but
with their children too.

1282
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:11,240
They loved their children the way we 
think of every modern person loving 

1283
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:15,501
their children or the way they should 
and that is not to say that people in 

1284
01:18:15,501 --> 01:18:18,771
the past didn't.
Although you find a lot of examples in 

1285
01:18:18,771 --> 01:18:21,891
the royal families throughout history 
where the father hardly sees the son 

1286
01:18:21,891 --> 01:18:21,891
eight.
It's not like that with these guys.

1287
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:27,110
They take an active day to day role in 
their parenting and they wrote letters 

1288
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:29,280
to each other constantly and they wrote 
in English,

1289
01:18:30,530 --> 01:18:31,970
which they both spoke.
Well,

1290
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:34,130
this is our arena was German,
but.

1291
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,170
But she spoke Russian.
She spoke English,

1292
01:18:36,171 --> 01:18:41,171
does our spoke everything and they 
communicated in more than a thousand 

1293
01:18:41,171 --> 01:18:42,440
letters with each other where you get a 
real feel for these people.

1294
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:47,650
And one of the things that they are 
absolutely terrified about is their son 

1295
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:48,650
who's got hemophilia,

1296
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:54,920
he's their only son,
he's the czar and he is almost certainly

1297
01:18:55,650 --> 01:18:58,050
going to die young from this disease 
now,

1298
01:18:58,051 --> 01:19:00,390
just so you know,
hemophilia is a disease where your blood

1299
01:19:00,391 --> 01:19:05,391
doesn't clot.
Not to get too technical because I 

1300
01:19:05,391 --> 01:19:05,391
couldn't explain it any way,
but um,

1301
01:19:05,391 --> 01:19:09,860
but basically any little cut or bruise 
has the potential to spiral out of 

1302
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:13,410
control.
The normal in a rough and tumble of a,

1303
01:19:13,440 --> 01:19:18,390
of a young child's life will kill you.
And in this era,

1304
01:19:18,391 --> 01:19:23,391
especially,
parents just assumed almost a death 

1305
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:23,490
sentence.
And these two parents,

1306
01:19:23,491 --> 01:19:28,491
as any parents we would think of today 
probably could hardly handle that 

1307
01:19:28,491 --> 01:19:29,990
thought.
And they were looking around for curious

1308
01:19:29,991 --> 01:19:34,991
and trying to find them.
And eventually they found someone who 

1309
01:19:34,991 --> 01:19:38,831
seemed to be able to fix their son.
And because of the little idiosyncrasy 

1310
01:19:39,301 --> 01:19:41,760
connected to who this person tended to 
be,

1311
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:44,880
world history is completely altered.

1312
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:52,360
And,
and the funny part about it is an 

1313
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:52,360
unknown.
It's a tragic story.

1314
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:52,360
It's a,
it's an interesting story.

1315
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:57,251
It's a very human story.
But there are elements to it that would 

1316
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:59,240
make a good sitcom or a good movie 
premise,

1317
01:19:59,241 --> 01:20:01,580
and I,
as I walked in to talk about this today,

1318
01:20:01,581 --> 01:20:06,581
I remembered the movie that was kind of 
based on the premise that it had nick 

1319
01:20:06,581 --> 01:20:09,611
naulty entity was called down and out in
Beverly Hills and the story is about a 

1320
01:20:09,611 --> 01:20:12,270
vagrant kinda homeless kind of guy who 
by hook or by crook ends up,

1321
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:17,570
you know,
in living with a rich family in beverly 

1322
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:17,570
hills,
a really fabulously rich family.

1323
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:22,460
And of course because of the dichotomy 
in their lifestyles and the way they 

1324
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:22,460
view the world,
hilarity ensues,

1325
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:27,170
right?
But that's Kinda what happened with the 

1326
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:29,490
tsar and his wife and they're 
hemophiliac son when they found somebody

1327
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:34,491
who seemed to be able to heal him,
that somebody was basically the 

1328
01:20:34,491 --> 01:20:36,870
equivalent of the vagrant in down and 
out in Beverly Hills.

1329
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:42,740
They were bringing a peasant in to have 
a look at their sick son.

1330
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:49,870
Peasants name is Gregory Rasputin.
And history has always been.

1331
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:52,730
I mean,
he's a hardcore history personality.

1332
01:20:52,731 --> 01:20:53,810
If you've ever found one.

1333
01:20:55,820 --> 01:21:00,820
And the fact that this government was 
run 99 percent by one guy and his wife 

1334
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:08,110
opens up the door to a greg gory 
Rasputin being able to have the effect 

1335
01:21:08,241 --> 01:21:13,241
on history.
He had historian Peter Hart does a good 

1336
01:21:13,241 --> 01:21:16,620
job of of framing all the various things
that seem to be going on at once,

1337
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:20,550
including what I just talked about,
the the way Russia is sort of a giant,

1338
01:21:20,551 --> 01:21:25,551
but hamstrung by this,
this ancient system of theirs so that a 

1339
01:21:25,551 --> 01:21:29,391
guy like Rasputin could make a 
difference in the idiosyncrasies of a 

1340
01:21:29,391 --> 01:21:30,330
single individual or two could come to 
the fore.

1341
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:31,440
He writes,
quote,

1342
01:21:32,210 --> 01:21:37,210
the Russian homefront was gradually 
collapsing under the intolerable strain 

1343
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:41,141
of war.
The czarist government did not have the 

1344
01:21:41,141 --> 01:21:42,380
flexibility necessary to cope with the 
plague of economic,

1345
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:47,560
political,
and social problems that infected the 

1346
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:50,261
land.
The tsar himself perceived any form of 

1347
01:21:50,261 --> 01:21:52,730
democracy is a threat to his regime,
and rather than introducing an increased

1348
01:21:52,731 --> 01:21:57,731
measure of liberalism was more attracted
to the idea of a total disillusion of 

1349
01:21:57,731 --> 01:22:02,030
even the tokenistic Duma appointments.
Depositions of considerable authority.

1350
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:07,240
We're routinely assigned by the czar on 
the grounds of either naked favoritism 

1351
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:09,470
or the authoritarian credentials of the 
candidate.

1352
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:14,830
Spy scares raged through society with 
particular suspicion falling on any 

1353
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:19,271
Russian general,
unfortunate enough to have a Germanic 

1354
01:22:19,271 --> 01:22:19,271
name.
Meanwhile,

1355
01:22:19,271 --> 01:22:22,760
incompetence and corruption blossomed 
unfettered while at the center.

1356
01:22:22,761 --> 01:22:27,080
The tsar was publicly embarrassed by the
adherence of the Zarina Alexandra to the

1357
01:22:27,081 --> 01:22:32,081
ludicrous cult of Rasputin and unhinged 
religious mystic with a pension for 

1358
01:22:32,091 --> 01:22:37,091
irreligious pursuits.
The whole despotic system of government 

1359
01:22:37,091 --> 01:22:38,720
was resting on just a few weak 
individuals.

1360
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:41,300
Russia was being hollowed out from 
within,

1361
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:46,450
and the vacuum at the center was 
creating dangerous instability and the 

1362
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:50,971
quote now,
everything that Peter Hart says right 

1363
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:53,810
there could have applied to several 
other countries in this story.

1364
01:22:54,350 --> 01:22:55,780
Everything except one thing.

1365
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:58,670
The part dealing with recipe

1366
01:23:00,290 --> 01:23:05,290
Gregori.
Rasputin is a great wildcard in the 

1367
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:05,290
story and a quintessentially Russian 
figure.

1368
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:06,160
I mean,
he's.

1369
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:11,340
It's hard to imagine him anywhere else 
and he is outrageous and larger than 

1370
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:15,451
life.
And I think Peter Hart has great 

1371
01:23:15,451 --> 01:23:18,400
historian as he is.
He sounds a little bit like he can't 

1372
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:18,400
understand,
you know,

1373
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,890
the Zarina,
the wife of the czar kind of falling for

1374
01:23:20,891 --> 01:23:24,310
this guy and his shtick.
He calls it the ludicrous Rasputin cult.

1375
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,160
I mean,
if you'd have had her here to ask her,

1376
01:23:27,161 --> 01:23:32,161
she'd probably say to you,
but I saw him do it multiple times.

1377
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:35,260
Do what?
Saved my son's life.

1378
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:39,860
If you saw somebody save your kid's life
multiple times,

1379
01:23:41,450 --> 01:23:46,450
don't you think it would be hard to have
your logic override what you think you 

1380
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:49,751
saw?
I've seen cold hearted total realists 

1381
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,660
turn into people seeking quack remedies 
when they were dying of cancer.

1382
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:59,500
They were looking for hope.
If your kid is dying,

1383
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:02,230
you're looking for hope.
What if somebody actually comes through?

1384
01:24:04,150 --> 01:24:09,150
I mean,
what if that quack treatment for your 

1385
01:24:09,150 --> 01:24:11,860
relatives,
terminal cancer cured the cancer.

1386
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:17,250
That's the weirdness in this story that 
the royal family,

1387
01:24:17,251 --> 01:24:21,510
the emperor and his wife,
run into this Guy Gregory Rasputin first

1388
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:22,410
in 19.
Oh,

1389
01:24:22,411 --> 01:24:22,980
five

1390
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:28,680
about 10 years before the time period.
We are in the story and there's an entry

1391
01:24:28,681 --> 01:24:33,681
by the czar in his diary.
We met a man of God today and so 

1392
01:24:33,681 --> 01:24:37,140
starched this relationship between this 
person who was born,

1393
01:24:37,141 --> 01:24:40,260
a poor peasant in Siberia,
you know,

1394
01:24:40,261 --> 01:24:44,010
uneducated,
everything and his relationship with two

1395
01:24:44,011 --> 01:24:46,710
of the most royal figures in the world.
I mean,

1396
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:48,450
when you think of the king and queen of 
England,

1397
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:52,020
that's the level we're talking about,
what the czar and Sarina imagine today's

1398
01:24:52,021 --> 01:24:53,970
queen of England who has no power at 
all,

1399
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:59,120
picking up some person off the street 
who's almost homeless and not even a 

1400
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:02,631
London homeless person.
Someone from the sticks up in the north 

1401
01:25:02,631 --> 01:25:02,631
of England somewhere,
some small town,

1402
01:25:02,631 --> 01:25:07,190
bringing them in the palace and having 
them live with you for awhile and sort 

1403
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:10,971
of questioning them on the state of 
things and what are the people saying 

1404
01:25:10,971 --> 01:25:13,590
and and Oh yeah,
letting the minister medicinally to your

1405
01:25:13,591 --> 01:25:18,591
child.
It's a crazy story and the only reason 

1406
01:25:18,591 --> 01:25:22,641
Rasputin becomes important.
You can hardly imagine him important in 

1407
01:25:22,641 --> 01:25:25,170
most of the other systems of government,
but because Russia is so autocratic,

1408
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:28,950
if you capture the czar,
you capture the country.

1409
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:34,550
Rasputin made the royal family emotional
hostages.

1410
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:41,300
Now,
whether that was intentional or 

1411
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:41,300
otherwise is debatable.
Historians disagree.

1412
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:46,760
There are some historians,
you think this is a person who thought 

1413
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:47,580
he was a blessed man of God with these 
special powers to do,

1414
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:49,980
you know,
religious oriented things and others say

1415
01:25:49,981 --> 01:25:54,981
he's a charlatan and he knew he had the 
royal couple sort of emotionally 

1416
01:25:54,981 --> 01:25:59,271
blackmail,
but there was nothing anyone could do 

1417
01:25:59,271 --> 01:25:59,271
about it.
There's a great quote from the czar,

1418
01:25:59,271 --> 01:26:00,660
you know,
in the middle of the story with Rasputin

1419
01:26:00,661 --> 01:26:05,661
where one of his advisors says something
to the effect of you to get rid of this 

1420
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:05,840
guy and the czar,
his answer is,

1421
01:26:05,841 --> 01:26:10,841
there's nothing I can do about it.
And a lot of historians have always 

1422
01:26:10,841 --> 01:26:13,460
interpreted that to mean that the czar 
is basically saying he can't stand up to

1423
01:26:13,461 --> 01:26:14,960
his wife.
You know,

1424
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:19,961
that she wants him.
And there's nothing that the czar can 

1425
01:26:19,961 --> 01:26:19,961
do.

1426
01:26:19,961 --> 01:26:19,961
He won't stand up to his wife.
But you know,

1427
01:26:19,961 --> 01:26:20,870
some historians have come out recently 
and said,

1428
01:26:20,871 --> 01:26:25,871
you know,
it could easily mean there's nothing he 

1429
01:26:25,871 --> 01:26:26,630
can do about it because there's only one
person who can save their son's life.

1430
01:26:26,631 --> 01:26:28,160
The heir to the throne,
by the way,

1431
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:33,520
if you really believed that this 
Rasputin guys got you in a weird 

1432
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,210
position between 19 Oh,
five.

1433
01:26:35,211 --> 01:26:40,211
When the czar and Rasputin first meet 
and where we are in this story right 

1434
01:26:40,211 --> 01:26:41,090
now,
late 1916,

1435
01:26:41,450 --> 01:26:46,450
Rasputin has been warming his way into 
the czars family pretty consistently.

1436
01:26:47,900 --> 01:26:49,670
Not as circle of friends,
his family,

1437
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:51,340
the czar.
We'll have these get togethers sometimes

1438
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:55,070
it was him and his wife and his kids and
Rasputin.

1439
01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:59,480
Now there our back steps.
Sometimes the relationship goes sour for

1440
01:26:59,481 --> 01:27:04,481
awhile usually because Rasputin,
who was a surreal misbehavior does 

1441
01:27:04,481 --> 01:27:06,950
something particularly outrageous,
either embarrassing the czar,

1442
01:27:06,951 --> 01:27:11,951
so much that that,
that he does what his underlings are 

1443
01:27:11,951 --> 01:27:14,861
continually telling them to do and sends
Rasputin a way or legitimately upsetting

1444
01:27:14,901 --> 01:27:16,010
him.
Nonetheless.

1445
01:27:16,011 --> 01:27:18,770
Every time he manages to break the 
relationship breakup,

1446
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:21,380
I guess you could say with Rasputin 
inevitably,

1447
01:27:21,381 --> 01:27:22,490
Alexi,
his son,

1448
01:27:22,491 --> 01:27:25,010
the heir to the throne will get sick 
again,

1449
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:29,780
necessitating a return of Rasputin.
He's like a cigarette habit.

1450
01:27:29,781 --> 01:27:30,590
You can't kick

1451
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:37,030
now.
This rescued and characters fascinating 

1452
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:37,030
on so many levels.
You know,

1453
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:41,021
you have to think you were dealt some 
interesting cards by fate to be able to 

1454
01:27:41,021 --> 01:27:44,540
parlay your gifts from his upbringing as
a,

1455
01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:49,690
as an uneducated peasant with no money 
in the middle of nowhere to where you 

1456
01:27:49,821 --> 01:27:52,130
are in the royal family.

1457
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:57,160
And when you see a picture of him,
you see a little bit of it.

1458
01:27:57,190 --> 01:27:59,320
I mean,
he was five foot nine inches tall,

1459
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:01,870
pretty normal.
Um,

1460
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:06,430
he had dark black,
oily hair parted in the middle,

1461
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:09,730
unkempt mustache,
unkempt beard,

1462
01:28:09,731 --> 01:28:11,170
interesting way of dressing.
I mean,

1463
01:28:11,171 --> 01:28:16,171
if you,
if you had photo shopped his picture 

1464
01:28:16,171 --> 01:28:17,860
onto the back of any number of 19 
seventies heavy metal albums,

1465
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:20,950
I don't think I would be able to look at
the bands photo on the back and,

1466
01:28:21,010 --> 01:28:26,010
and know that you did it.
He would have fit in perfectly as the 

1467
01:28:26,010 --> 01:28:26,010
basis of any number of bands from back 
then.

1468
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:31,380
Heck,
if he were a lead singer and you named 

1469
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:31,840
the band after him,
it would fit in on any lineup.

1470
01:28:31,841 --> 01:28:34,390
You could think of it as a heavy metal 
festival winded.

1471
01:28:34,391 --> 01:28:34,980
I mean,
you know,

1472
01:28:34,990 --> 01:28:37,360
this weekend only black Sabbath,
iron maiden,

1473
01:28:37,361 --> 01:28:42,361
motorhead and Rasputin,
he had the most amazing eyes and you can

1474
01:28:42,551 --> 01:28:46,780
tell because normally you can't tell 
from photos 100 years ago,

1475
01:28:47,010 --> 01:28:48,850
you know,
certain qualities of individuals.

1476
01:28:48,851 --> 01:28:51,520
It just gets lost through the layers of,
of,

1477
01:28:51,650 --> 01:28:53,500
of fuzziness and black and white and all
that.

1478
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:58,740
But if you catch the right photo of 
respite and he had to be hand to be 

1479
01:28:58,740 --> 01:29:01,771
caught just the right time,
you can see what the eyes were like 

1480
01:29:01,771 --> 01:29:02,010
because they jump of the black and white

1481
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:07,010
photo from 100 years ago at you.
Even now the whites of his eyes were 

1482
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:09,180
said by witnesses to be extra white and 
again,

1483
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:14,240
it kind of looks that way and some of 
the photos is eichler dazzle people to 

1484
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:18,111
the point where we have multiple 
descriptions that all contradict each 

1485
01:29:18,111 --> 01:29:18,111
other.
Some people say blue,

1486
01:29:18,111 --> 01:29:18,690
some people say Brown.
Some people say gray.

1487
01:29:18,691 --> 01:29:23,691
Some people say multicolored.
When you read about his sort of tick 

1488
01:29:24,251 --> 01:29:28,450
like way of walking,
moving his nervous habits,

1489
01:29:28,451 --> 01:29:30,760
the way he wouldn't talk for a while and
then all of a sudden you get this,

1490
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:36,030
this stream of sometimes unrelated 
conversation spiced with sexual 

1491
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:40,621
innuendos.
I mean there's a part of you that 

1492
01:29:40,621 --> 01:29:42,541
thinks,
I mean I just read a book on the late 

1493
01:29:42,541 --> 01:29:42,541
writer,
a hunter,

1494
01:29:42,541 --> 01:29:42,541
Thompson,
they sound like in a room together.

1495
01:29:42,541 --> 01:29:43,960
They would look like they were 
impersonating each other.

1496
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:50,030
Rasputin is a combination of a person 
who looks to be a very devout religious 

1497
01:29:52,501 --> 01:29:56,790
figure from Russia's Christianity and 
Orthodox Christian,

1498
01:29:57,140 --> 01:29:58,890
um,
and a drunk and hell raiser.

1499
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:03,240
And apparently that's not that unusual 
in a,

1500
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:08,320
in the Russian tradition,
especially in the Siberian tradition 

1501
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:08,320
where Rasputin's from,

1502
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:13,360
there are some offshoots and sex and 
cults who had these interesting beliefs 

1503
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:14,240
and I don't understand them and 
wouldn't,

1504
01:30:14,360 --> 01:30:19,360
wouldn't try to explain them,
but apparently it involves needing to 

1505
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,680
sin sometimes in order to get the right 
kind of repentance working for you.

1506
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:24,860
And,
and there are rumors of orgies that take

1507
01:30:24,861 --> 01:30:26,900
place as part of the rights for these 
religions.

1508
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:28,640
And some historians,
not most,

1509
01:30:28,641 --> 01:30:31,250
but some have tied Rasputin to some of 
those,

1510
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:36,600
um,
strange sex and strange beliefs and it 

1511
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:36,600
would make sense in one in one sense 
though,

1512
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:40,961
because there's,
there are conversations that have been 

1513
01:30:40,961 --> 01:30:40,961
recorded with his wife and yes,
he was married,

1514
01:30:41,030 --> 01:30:42,610
you know,
when she would walk past him in,

1515
01:30:42,611 --> 01:30:43,030
in,
in,

1516
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:46,130
in the middle of a town with other women
and they would all see him having sex in

1517
01:30:46,131 --> 01:30:47,870
the open with some towns,
woman,

1518
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:49,520
she would say something to the effect 
of,

1519
01:30:49,521 --> 01:30:51,080
well,
that's just his cross to bear.

1520
01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:52,520
He's got to do that.
You know what I mean?

1521
01:30:52,521 --> 01:30:55,310
Like he didn't want to just,
he has to do that.

1522
01:30:55,311 --> 01:30:57,470
That's,
that's he's helping those people.

1523
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:01,950
I'm sure if I was rescued and I would 
want to sell it that way,

1524
01:31:01,951 --> 01:31:02,730
let's put it that way.

1525
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:08,520
The to gossip column type offenses that 
he's,

1526
01:31:08,521 --> 01:31:13,521
he's always tarred with our,
our extreme drunkenness and sexual 

1527
01:31:13,521 --> 01:31:18,111
outrageousness.
And usually in combination with each 

1528
01:31:18,111 --> 01:31:18,111
other,

1529
01:31:18,111 --> 01:31:22,890
there are rape charges that are brought 
to the czar in Zarina's attention were 

1530
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:24,010
the household staff is accusing him of 
going after them.

1531
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:29,250
He's absolutely brazen.
He will sit down next to have a figure 

1532
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:32,761
from the royal family and put his arm 
around her at a party with all the 

1533
01:31:32,761 --> 01:31:33,820
aristocrats there and start moving in on
her.

1534
01:31:34,330 --> 01:31:39,330
There are stories that you have to know 
that the Zaras arena knew he was this 

1535
01:31:39,330 --> 01:31:42,601
way because at these family gatherings I
mentioned earlier where they're all 

1536
01:31:42,601 --> 01:31:42,601
sitting there and it's just him and the 
family.

1537
01:31:42,601 --> 01:31:47,461
He'll sit next to the princesses who are
all adolescent girls during this time 

1538
01:31:47,461 --> 01:31:50,851
period and they will jump up like 
they've been prompted with a hot needle 

1539
01:31:51,031 --> 01:31:55,840
because he's goosing them and feeling 
them in front of the czar and Zarina.

1540
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:59,070
And yet at the same time,
um,

1541
01:31:59,890 --> 01:32:00,190
some

1542
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:04,390
of this stuff is passed off as just part
of his rustic peasant charm.

1543
01:32:04,420 --> 01:32:07,330
Isn't it cute that he doesn't know how 
inappropriate that is?

1544
01:32:07,570 --> 01:32:12,570
Like I said,
some of these people in Russia's 

1545
01:32:12,570 --> 01:32:14,280
aristocracy hated him,
but those who didn't kind of had a 

1546
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:18,241
reaction like he was some sort of exotic
thing that the zoo brought in and you 

1547
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:19,420
have to make allowances for what he 
doesn't understand.

1548
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:21,760
He might not know.
You can't just walk up and touch them.

1549
01:32:21,761 --> 01:32:26,160
Noble Woman's breast at dinner and how,
how funny and interesting it is at isn't

1550
01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:27,130
outrageous,
you know,

1551
01:32:27,131 --> 01:32:28,510
that kind of an attitude.
Uh,

1552
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:30,690
but he was fun and historian Joseph 
Fermin,

1553
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:33,100
who's written two books on Rasputin,
pointed that out,

1554
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:38,200
quote Rasputin was fun.
It was a pleasure to be in his company.

1555
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:42,220
He gave people nicknames and they were 
often cutting and quite appropriate.

1556
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:46,150
He might double a woman hot stuff,
boss lady,

1557
01:32:46,330 --> 01:32:51,330
sexy girl,
or good looking while a man would be 

1558
01:32:51,330 --> 01:32:51,880
called fancy pants,
big breaches,

1559
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,770
long hair or fellow people accepted this
as a charming characteristic.

1560
01:32:56,890 --> 01:33:00,610
The humor of a peasant who meant no 
disrespect and quote.

1561
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:05,130
So the people that didn't hate Rasputin 
would often,

1562
01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:08,370
you know,
overlook his outrageousness and consider

1563
01:33:08,371 --> 01:33:09,400
that part of,
you know,

1564
01:33:09,660 --> 01:33:13,380
his charm is rustic peasant charm.
Nonetheless,

1565
01:33:13,381 --> 01:33:16,170
sometimes it was a little too much.
Even for the czar,

1566
01:33:16,171 --> 01:33:19,050
there's famous incidents and they all 
end up in the local media.

1567
01:33:19,051 --> 01:33:24,051
Believe it or not,
Russia had a tabloid media during this 

1568
01:33:24,051 --> 01:33:25,440
time period.
And Rasputin was one of their staple,

1569
01:33:25,930 --> 01:33:26,820
you know,
figures.

1570
01:33:26,821 --> 01:33:27,900
But I mean,
back in my day,

1571
01:33:28,530 --> 01:33:33,530
every one of them had to have it 
Elizabeth Taylor story or a Michael 

1572
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:34,800
Jackson story or something like that.
Kim Kardashians,

1573
01:33:34,801 --> 01:33:36,930
probably today,
back then in Russia,

1574
01:33:36,931 --> 01:33:39,060
if you didn't have a respite in the 
story,

1575
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:40,470
you know,
every so often,

1576
01:33:40,770 --> 01:33:45,770
I mean you were worried about 
circulation dropping and just when you 

1577
01:33:45,770 --> 01:33:46,230
think there'd be no new news,
he gets roaring drunk in a,

1578
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,900
in a Highfalutin restaurant in the 
capital city.

1579
01:33:49,050 --> 01:33:54,050
Starts yelling about how he knows the 
czar and then pulls his pants down and 

1580
01:33:54,050 --> 01:33:56,040
whips his genitals out to the restaurant
word like that,

1581
01:33:56,041 --> 01:33:57,900
gets around in the tabloids,
eat it up.

1582
01:33:57,901 --> 01:34:02,901
At one point,
does our had to tell the tabloids that 

1583
01:34:02,901 --> 01:34:04,260
they couldn't mention his name anymore.
So they just started referring to him as

1584
01:34:04,261 --> 01:34:07,650
the guy who lives on so and so street,
whatever street he lived on.

1585
01:34:07,890 --> 01:34:10,290
And everyone in the public just knew who
they meant.

1586
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:17,780
There were cartoons that made the rounds
showing Rasputin,

1587
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,320
um,
with his hand on the naked breast of the

1588
01:34:21,321 --> 01:34:26,321
Zarina,
implying what a lot of people wondered 

1589
01:34:26,321 --> 01:34:29,231
about this relationship.
Although it's almost certainly not true 

1590
01:34:29,231 --> 01:34:31,250
if Rasputin's going around town,
sleeping with everything that moves from

1591
01:34:31,251 --> 01:34:35,600
peasants to royal women as well.
What's he doing with the Zarina?

1592
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:42,440
There are even whisperings and one 
public charge made that the

1593
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:47,750
heir to the throne.
The Tsar's son is really Rasputin son.

1594
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:51,920
Almost certainly not true,
but the more gossip circulated with that

1595
01:34:51,921 --> 01:34:53,810
kind of talk,
the more it undermined,

1596
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:57,680
you know,
people's trust in the [inaudible] arena.

1597
01:34:57,740 --> 01:35:02,740
Remember this arena's already German at 
a time when the Russian people are 

1598
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:05,210
hounding Russian generals who just have 
German last names.

1599
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:10,540
What happens if you are German and the 
[inaudible] not around and this strange 

1600
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:12,890
Russian peasant who seems like a spin 
golly is.

1601
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:18,040
I mean there were protests in 1915 where
the people were saying down with respite

1602
01:35:18,041 --> 01:35:22,550
and down with Alexandra,
he's not an unknown quantity.

1603
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:25,040
Everyone realizes he's almost a public 
figure.

1604
01:35:25,190 --> 01:35:30,190
They debate him in the legislature and 
the powers that be want him gone.

1605
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:35,650
There's a story during this time period 
about one of the ways they tried to get 

1606
01:35:35,650 --> 01:35:37,910
him out.
It's a famous story one day Rasputin.

1607
01:35:37,911 --> 01:35:42,911
Here's a knock at his door.
He goes to the door and there's a man 

1608
01:35:42,911 --> 01:35:45,701
standing there with a package and he 
gives risks in the package and Rasputin 

1609
01:35:45,701 --> 01:35:49,601
opens the package and it's full of 
photos and Rasputin looks at the photos 

1610
01:35:49,601 --> 01:35:53,441
and they are photos of him unconscious,
insensible due to drink,

1611
01:35:54,350 --> 01:35:57,050
and there are naked women all around 
him.

1612
01:35:57,470 --> 01:35:58,610
Night photos.

1613
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:05,180
The man at the door who gave him the 
package says either you leave town and 

1614
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:08,901
go back to where you came from and stop 
talking and influencing the czar or 

1615
01:36:08,901 --> 01:36:09,060
we're going to give these pictures to 
him.

1616
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:15,200
It was an extortion attempt and I'm one 
of the nights apparently that respite 

1617
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:19,381
and had passed out from drink.
His enemies had hired prostitutes and 

1618
01:36:19,381 --> 01:36:22,020
position them around him naked and 
started taking photos to blackmail him.

1619
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:25,050
In typical,
unexpected fashion.

1620
01:36:25,051 --> 01:36:28,320
Rasputin took the photos straight to the
czar and sort of,

1621
01:36:28,460 --> 01:36:30,390
you know,
threw himself on the mercy of the court.

1622
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,920
Now a lot of the time Rasputin's able to
skate away with no real repercussions.

1623
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:39,410
Sometimes he's not,
as we said,

1624
01:36:39,411 --> 01:36:42,410
occasional riffs would develop between 
the czar and Rasputin.

1625
01:36:42,710 --> 01:36:44,030
One of them,
for example,

1626
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:49,090
that went on in 1912,
is a perfect example of how hard it was 

1627
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:51,110
for the czar to stay away from Rasputin 
in 1912.

1628
01:36:51,111 --> 01:36:56,111
They have one of these disagreements on 
the [inaudible] sends Rasputin back to 

1629
01:36:56,111 --> 01:36:59,321
Siberia.
The royal family goes on a vacation in 

1630
01:36:59,321 --> 01:36:59,810
September,
1912 to their country palace.

1631
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:02,240
They're playing around in the young heir
to the throne.

1632
01:37:02,241 --> 01:37:05,510
Lexi jumps in a boat.
He's about seven or eight years old.

1633
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:10,570
Not Unusual,
not unusual for seven or eight year old 

1634
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:13,361
to land wrong and hurt themselves,
but most of these seven or eight year 

1635
01:37:13,361 --> 01:37:13,361
olds,
of course,

1636
01:37:13,361 --> 01:37:15,320
not hemophiliac,
so it instantly becomes a problem.

1637
01:37:15,321 --> 01:37:17,540
There's a giant Hematoma in his lower 
abdomen.

1638
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:20,450
They take them back to the palace and 
they have a terrible scare.

1639
01:37:21,110 --> 01:37:23,420
He gets very ill,
very bad.

1640
01:37:23,690 --> 01:37:28,690
Uh,
it takes about a month for him to start 

1641
01:37:28,690 --> 01:37:30,491
to recover.
And as he's just starting to turn the 

1642
01:37:30,491 --> 01:37:30,491
corner,
and I've never understood this,

1643
01:37:30,491 --> 01:37:30,860
his mother,
there's our arena,

1644
01:37:30,861 --> 01:37:35,861
thinks it'd be great to take them on a 
little carriage ride and it's a bumpy 

1645
01:37:35,861 --> 01:37:39,101
road and they hit some bumps and he 
cries out and pain and something's 

1646
01:37:39,101 --> 01:37:40,460
happened inside him.
They take him back to the palace and now

1647
01:37:40,461 --> 01:37:45,461
they have one of the most horrific 
periods of their life starting because 

1648
01:37:45,461 --> 01:37:50,351
this kid starts to die and it takes a 
while and it's very painful and the 

1649
01:37:51,111 --> 01:37:55,970
parents are watching it.
I mean the kids fever skyrockets.

1650
01:37:56,160 --> 01:38:01,160
The pain becomes so terrible.
He's delirious and slipping in and out 

1651
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:03,560
of consciousness.
I read somewhere that a opium is used in

1652
01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:06,080
the past sometimes for people in the 
heir to the throne,

1653
01:38:06,081 --> 01:38:07,740
his condition,
but they didn't use it for him.

1654
01:38:08,070 --> 01:38:11,820
And the screams are so terrible that 
we're told the palace staff has to stuff

1655
01:38:11,821 --> 01:38:14,100
cotton in their ears to walk around to 
deal with it.

1656
01:38:14,610 --> 01:38:15,990
The parents,
like I said,

1657
01:38:15,991 --> 01:38:20,991
loving real hands on.
Parents take their turn at his bedside 

1658
01:38:21,660 --> 01:38:23,130
and he's begging for help.
He's,

1659
01:38:23,190 --> 01:38:24,240
he's saying,
Lord,

1660
01:38:24,241 --> 01:38:29,241
have mercy on me.
Was one of the things recorded over and 

1661
01:38:29,241 --> 01:38:31,821
over and over again and my mom helped me
the pain and we're told that when the 

1662
01:38:32,581 --> 01:38:34,560
parents shifted,
the bedside was over,

1663
01:38:34,561 --> 01:38:36,750
they would walk out of the room and just
burst into tears.

1664
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:42,320
The czar said that the Zarina handled 
the ordeal better than he did at a 

1665
01:38:42,931 --> 01:38:45,060
certain point that doctors run out of 
things to do.

1666
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,610
They tell the parents there's nothing 
more they can do.

1667
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:52,820
It becomes apparent to the parents and 
to the patient that he's dying and he 

1668
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:56,730
starts talking about those things that 
destroy parents.

1669
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:58,810
I mean that you never want to hear your 
little kid saying he's.

1670
01:38:58,880 --> 01:38:59,880
He's saying,
when I die,

1671
01:38:59,881 --> 01:39:03,990
will the pain be gone to his mother?
He asked that after he dies,

1672
01:39:03,991 --> 01:39:08,991
they build this little shrine in the 
woods for amount of stones and then the 

1673
01:39:08,991 --> 01:39:13,311
reality of the situation sets in and 
they start putting together a public 

1674
01:39:13,311 --> 01:39:15,780
statement to tell the Russian people 
that the heir to the throne has died.

1675
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:21,380
The last rites are performed and while 
at a meeting,

1676
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:25,530
the czar gets a hand scrawled note from 
his wife saying,

1677
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:29,160
come quickly.
I think it's time the boy's about to die

1678
01:39:29,790 --> 01:39:34,790
at the last minute,
the Zarina pens and note to rest butte 

1679
01:39:34,790 --> 01:39:39,111
and often Siberia essentially saying 
help and she gets a cable the next 

1680
01:39:39,111 --> 01:39:39,180
morning.

1681
01:39:39,210 --> 01:39:44,210
It's a famous cable and it lets a little
air out of the tires that it's not as 

1682
01:39:44,210 --> 01:39:44,730
good.
According to a historian,

1683
01:39:44,731 --> 01:39:46,650
Josef Herman,
as we always thought it was,

1684
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:52,100
the cable was always thought to say God 
has seen your tears and heard your 

1685
01:39:52,411 --> 01:39:54,240
prayers.
Do not grieve.

1686
01:39:54,420 --> 01:39:59,420
The little one will not die.
Do not allow the doctors to bother him 

1687
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:03,201
too much.
And quote Russians during the Alexandra 

1688
01:40:03,410 --> 01:40:04,070
Spring,
uh,

1689
01:40:04,310 --> 01:40:06,360
apparently says there was,
there were two notes,

1690
01:40:06,361 --> 01:40:08,670
but the one that was misquoted really 
said,

1691
01:40:08,671 --> 01:40:10,230
quote,
fear nothing.

1692
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:12,810
The illness is not as dangerous as 
they're saying.

1693
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:17,870
See that the doctors do not bother him.
And by that afternoon the boy is out of 

1694
01:40:20,281 --> 01:40:23,280
pain and is able to sleep and the fever 
starts dropping.

1695
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:26,400
The doctors are stunned and it should be
pointed out.

1696
01:40:26,401 --> 01:40:28,950
They hate Rasputin,
but they were forced.

1697
01:40:28,951 --> 01:40:33,951
I mean,
there's several of them quoted in the 

1698
01:40:33,951 --> 01:40:33,951
infirmary [inaudible] latest book.

1699
01:40:33,951 --> 01:40:34,290
He's written two books on Rasputin and 
they're just,

1700
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:39,980
they don't know what to even make of it 
and it wasn't just this time they would 

1701
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:43,491
be trying to stop the boy from bleeding 
and past incidents and Rasputin would 

1702
01:40:43,491 --> 01:40:47,211
come up and they would watch him stop it
and historians have been trying to find 

1703
01:40:47,211 --> 01:40:49,260
explanations for this ever since.
I mean,

1704
01:40:49,261 --> 01:40:54,261
I've heard everything from hypnosis to 
the power of suggestion to drugs to one 

1705
01:40:55,331 --> 01:40:59,110
theory is that that they were giving the
young czar aspirin,

1706
01:40:59,111 --> 01:41:04,111
which was like the new wonder drug back 
then and that of course would have been 

1707
01:41:04,111 --> 01:41:06,811
the worst thing to give them and when 
respite and says don't let the doctors 

1708
01:41:06,811 --> 01:41:07,300
bothered him too much.
They stopped giving him the Asprin.

1709
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:12,750
Some people have suggested that there 
were some potion Rasputin had the sort 

1710
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:12,940
of kept the boy,
you know,

1711
01:41:12,941 --> 01:41:14,830
in a bad state.
Anytime he wanted to,

1712
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:20,050
you know,
put a little emotional pressure on the 

1713
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:20,050
royal family.
There's all kinds of theories,

1714
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:23,200
but if you're the Zarina and you've 
already seen respite and save your son's

1715
01:41:23,201 --> 01:41:28,201
life several times and he just pulled 
him back from the brink of death by 

1716
01:41:28,201 --> 01:41:32,551
telegram,
don't you think you'd stop caring about 

1717
01:41:32,551 --> 01:41:36,490
the wherefores and the what ifs and just
not want this guy to leave your side.

1718
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:43,580
If the czar of Russia was in the process
of kicking his respite and habit,

1719
01:41:43,581 --> 01:41:46,910
he fell off the wagon after that 1912,
you know,

1720
01:41:46,911 --> 01:41:49,220
pull your son back from the brink of 
death moment.

1721
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:51,980
Now,
here's the thing,

1722
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:58,400
Rasputin wasn't a problem because he 
kept healing the heir to the throne.

1723
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:04,420
If he had stuck to that,
probably we don't even talk about him 

1724
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:04,760
very much.
Of course,

1725
01:42:04,761 --> 01:42:07,190
the reason we do talk about and the 
reason he's a famous figure,

1726
01:42:07,191 --> 01:42:12,191
the reason half of Russia wants him dead
is because he's not sticking to fixing 

1727
01:42:12,191 --> 01:42:16,151
the air.
He's meddling in policy in a funny way 

1728
01:42:16,151 --> 01:42:17,590
to.
I can see how that happened.

1729
01:42:17,890 --> 01:42:19,030
I'm not so appalled.
I mean,

1730
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:19,810
if you,
if you,

1731
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:24,840
if you look at this from the czar as our
arenas vantage point and you think this 

1732
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:28,711
guy has something,
does arena thinks he's a man of God and 

1733
01:42:28,711 --> 01:42:31,851
that God favors him and all the in the 
prophetic and if you'd seen what she'd 

1734
01:42:31,851 --> 01:42:32,050
seen,
wouldn't you think?

1735
01:42:32,051 --> 01:42:36,310
So maybe to win if you thought that,
wouldn't you want to use this guy like a

1736
01:42:36,311 --> 01:42:41,311
magic eight ball,
especially with the stakes as high as 

1737
01:42:41,311 --> 01:42:42,830
they are for the czar at this time.
I mean,

1738
01:42:42,831 --> 01:42:46,220
when the first world war breaks out,
when the Romanov Dynasty is threatened,

1739
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:49,730
when millions of lives hinge on the 
decision the Zar makes,

1740
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:51,710
how tempting would it be?
You know,

1741
01:42:51,711 --> 01:42:56,711
to just sort of ask Rasputin what he 
thought about disappointment or that 

1742
01:42:56,711 --> 01:43:01,481
idea.
Should I go to the front end to command 

1743
01:43:01,481 --> 01:43:01,481
from the front line sources?
Say Yes.

1744
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:04,290
And that's the event.
By the way,

1745
01:43:04,530 --> 01:43:06,780
the czar going to command at the front 
lines,

1746
01:43:07,110 --> 01:43:12,090
which opens up the door to turbo 
charging Rasputin's influence and really

1747
01:43:12,091 --> 01:43:16,680
ushering Russia into the terminal phase 
of the end of the Romanov Dynasty.

1748
01:43:16,681 --> 01:43:19,740
Because what happens is,
you know the terrible losses against the

1749
01:43:20,130 --> 01:43:22,050
central powers that the Russians had 
suffered.

1750
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:27,780
The czar thought that people might need 
a scapegoat and he altruistically 

1751
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:29,460
offered himself up as a sacrificial 
lamb.

1752
01:43:29,610 --> 01:43:34,610
He thinks he's going to go to the front.
His advisors think this is a terrible 

1753
01:43:34,610 --> 01:43:34,610
idea,
would lots of downsides,

1754
01:43:34,610 --> 01:43:37,020
but Rasputin likes the idea.
Therefore,

1755
01:43:37,021 --> 01:43:37,650
by the way,
those aren't.

1756
01:43:37,651 --> 01:43:42,651
Rena likes the idea.
At one point the Zaras wavering and 

1757
01:43:42,651 --> 01:43:45,141
things maybe he shouldn't do it in 
Rasputin bolsters his confidence that 

1758
01:43:45,141 --> 01:43:48,411
it's a good idea and so the czar leaves 
the capital and goes to Kinda close to 

1759
01:43:48,411 --> 01:43:51,260
the front lines and all of a sudden 
there's our arenas left in charge of day

1760
01:43:51,261 --> 01:43:52,310
to day activities

1761
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:55,730
and she's using rest Putin like a magic 
eight ball,

1762
01:43:55,731 --> 01:43:56,870
like you wouldn't believe.

1763
01:43:58,970 --> 01:44:03,970
You can read it in the letters back and 
forth between the tsar and his wife 

1764
01:44:03,970 --> 01:44:03,970
because she'll inform them what's going 
on.

1765
01:44:03,970 --> 01:44:07,250
She calls Rasputin our friend.
That's your little code name for him.

1766
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,430
And she'll say to the,
are our friend thinks we should do this.

1767
01:44:10,490 --> 01:44:15,490
Our friend doesn't like that legislator.
Our friend thinks that appointment job 

1768
01:44:15,490 --> 01:44:17,780
should go to this person and they'll 
debate it back and forth and Rasputin is

1769
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:23,080
making huge decisions for Russia's 
future in war time when things are 

1770
01:44:23,211 --> 01:44:27,660
deteriorating badly and bread riots are 
happening and and and dissatisfaction is

1771
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:32,680
palpably on.
The rise and demonstrations are 

1772
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:34,170
occurring and he's drinking 12 bottles 
of wine a day at wake up.

1773
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:41,340
I don't think the belligerent powers of 
the other countries aren't aware of it 

1774
01:44:41,340 --> 01:44:42,400
either.
The British secret service is monitoring

1775
01:44:42,401 --> 01:44:44,880
according to historians like Joseph 
Herman,

1776
01:44:45,310 --> 01:44:48,040
Monitoring Rasputin.
They have a nickname for him,

1777
01:44:48,041 --> 01:44:53,041
a code name.
They call them dark forces and many 

1778
01:44:53,041 --> 01:44:53,710
things about Rasputin troubled and 
they're not sure.

1779
01:44:53,711 --> 01:44:56,350
He's not a German agent.
They think he's unstable.

1780
01:44:56,351 --> 01:45:01,351
Certainly they think he is in favor of 
some sort of peace deal to get rushed 

1781
01:45:01,351 --> 01:45:06,321
out of the war.
There's a lot of reasons they don't 

1782
01:45:06,321 --> 01:45:07,600
Kinda like him,
but this problem is becoming acute and

1783
01:45:08,400 --> 01:45:13,400
some nobleman apparently take it upon 
themselves to read Russia of this 

1784
01:45:13,591 --> 01:45:15,660
cancer,
which is the way they see risks.

1785
01:45:15,661 --> 01:45:20,590
Putin that decided to kill him,
and when we reached this point,

1786
01:45:20,950 --> 01:45:24,250
we're actually caught up with the story 
timeline again.

1787
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:29,580
It's December 19,
16 where we left off before our little 

1788
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:29,980
Russian digression,
you know,

1789
01:45:29,981 --> 01:45:34,981
that time with the submarines and the 
peace deals on the table and the 

1790
01:45:34,981 --> 01:45:36,340
questions about the US getting into the 
war or not.

1791
01:45:37,150 --> 01:45:38,550
In December,
19,

1792
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:43,580
16,
rumors are flying and the capital that 

1793
01:45:43,580 --> 01:45:47,270
Rasputin is going to be killed and 
they're so pervasive.

1794
01:45:47,690 --> 01:45:51,020
Rasputin hears them,
allegedly has children,

1795
01:45:51,021 --> 01:45:53,300
hear them do,
and they hide his clothes so he can't go

1796
01:45:53,301 --> 01:45:55,460
out.
Nonetheless,

1797
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:58,730
even with those rumors flying,
he can't resist.

1798
01:45:58,731 --> 01:46:03,731
And this is the traditional story.
This is a Kennedy assassination type 

1799
01:46:03,731 --> 01:46:03,950
thing.
And Good Luck finding the truth.

1800
01:46:03,951 --> 01:46:06,770
I'm just giving you the,
the most common story here.

1801
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:13,140
Apparently a nobleman offers his wife to
rest Butin,

1802
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,550
you know,
a nice little clandestine arrangement,

1803
01:46:15,551 --> 01:46:17,260
uh,
after a party or something like that.

1804
01:46:17,590 --> 01:46:20,830
Rasputin takes the guy up on the offer.
He's a nobleman.

1805
01:46:20,831 --> 01:46:25,831
Felix,
you saw Paul is his name and I think 

1806
01:46:25,831 --> 01:46:27,901
he's so rich.
He has more money than the ruling 

1807
01:46:27,901 --> 01:46:27,901
dynasty and he's working with a bunch of
other men.

1808
01:46:27,901 --> 01:46:32,681
It's a true conspiracy.
Nobody knows how deeply there are some 

1809
01:46:32,681 --> 01:46:32,890
who think the British secret service was
even in on it.

1810
01:46:33,370 --> 01:46:38,370
The majority don't you stop off,
meets Rasputin kind of at his door,

1811
01:46:38,591 --> 01:46:43,591
brings him down into the basement.
A Yankee doodle to tie this story 

1812
01:46:43,591 --> 01:46:47,290
together wonderfully is playing on the 
phonograph upstairs that they can hear.

1813
01:46:47,620 --> 01:46:50,340
So you get this little American playing 
in this story

1814
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:55,340
as,
as a Russia reaches the terminal phase 

1815
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:56,300
here in the Romanov Dynasty.
Um,

1816
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:58,320
there's food on the table,
there's wine.

1817
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:01,350
Uh,
the rendezvous is a little pushed back.

1818
01:47:01,351 --> 01:47:06,351
You saw Bob says.
So they sit there and they eat the food 

1819
01:47:06,351 --> 01:47:06,870
and they drink the wine and after a 
while you stop off,

1820
01:47:06,871 --> 01:47:11,871
begins to freak out because he's laced 
all these things with cyanide.

1821
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:14,780
And this guy's not dying.

1822
01:47:16,330 --> 01:47:21,330
He says he's a,
his throat's bothering him a little in 

1823
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:21,330
his stomach's bothering him a little,
but he's,

1824
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:24,040
he's sitting there drinking more,
eating more than asking you so pumped to

1825
01:47:24,041 --> 01:47:26,110
sing for him.
I liked your singing voice,

1826
01:47:26,350 --> 01:47:27,820
you so bob,
he excuses himself,

1827
01:47:27,821 --> 01:47:30,580
goes upstairs to where the other 
conspirators are and freaks out.

1828
01:47:30,581 --> 01:47:32,530
What are we going to do?
Finally,

1829
01:47:32,531 --> 01:47:34,040
one of them decides,
um,

1830
01:47:34,270 --> 01:47:36,940
they should shoot him.
And [inaudible] got a pistol so you soap

1831
01:47:36,941 --> 01:47:37,840
up,
goes down there,

1832
01:47:37,930 --> 01:47:41,170
tells 'em Rasputin to look at something 
on the wall over there.

1833
01:47:41,290 --> 01:47:41,970
And then,
uh,

1834
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:44,200
when Rasputin turns around,
the pistols pointed at him,

1835
01:47:44,350 --> 01:47:45,490
you saw Paul says,
he said,

1836
01:47:45,491 --> 01:47:47,290
you know,
say your prayers or something like that,

1837
01:47:47,291 --> 01:47:50,350
shot him in the chest.
He screams and he falls down on the rug,

1838
01:47:50,351 --> 01:47:52,390
frothing at the mouth,
convulsions dies.

1839
01:47:55,040 --> 01:47:57,500
The assassins all come downstairs,
have a look at the body,

1840
01:47:57,501 --> 01:47:58,430
the blood,
everything.

1841
01:47:59,420 --> 01:48:02,090
Go upstairs to commiserate about it for 
awhile.

1842
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:04,340
And then we're told that the assassin 
yourself off,

1843
01:48:04,550 --> 01:48:08,860
wants to have another look at the body.
And so he goes downstairs and,

1844
01:48:08,861 --> 01:48:13,861
uh,
just affirming the historian quoting 

1845
01:48:13,861 --> 01:48:15,761
some original sources in his quote,
talks about what happened when you soap 

1846
01:48:15,761 --> 01:48:19,841
off.
Went down there to just make sure that 

1847
01:48:19,841 --> 01:48:20,150
nothing wasn't.
Miss Thurman writes,

1848
01:48:20,151 --> 01:48:25,151
quote,
he found Rasputin lying in the same 

1849
01:48:25,151 --> 01:48:26,960
position on the floor.
Overcome with a terrible inner rage,

1850
01:48:27,080 --> 01:48:29,630
you soap up,
grabbed Rasputin by the shoulders,

1851
01:48:29,631 --> 01:48:32,420
and shook him as he stared into 
Rasputin's face.

1852
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:36,980
First one I and then the others suddenly
opened and then the source he's quoting,

1853
01:48:36,981 --> 01:48:41,720
says greenish and snake I'd they fixed 
the prince with an expression of satanic

1854
01:48:41,721 --> 01:48:44,330
hatred.
Rasputin stumbled to his feet,

1855
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:46,970
foaming at the mouth,
roaring and anger,

1856
01:48:46,971 --> 01:48:48,830
and wildly clawing at the air.

1857
01:48:48,830 --> 01:48:52,160
As he rushed towards you soph off blood 
dripping from his mouth,

1858
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:56,420
he grabbed the prince by the shoulder,
ripping an epithet from his uniform.

1859
01:48:56,630 --> 01:48:59,990
Rasputin was reportedly groundling,
his tormentors name,

1860
01:48:59,991 --> 01:49:04,940
and a low guttural voice and quote.
It's like a Zombie.

1861
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:10,420
And you soap office screaming.
I mean everybody runs downstairs when 

1862
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:11,240
they hear this struggle going on and use
up of a screaming.

1863
01:49:11,241 --> 01:49:12,710
And by the time everybody gets 
downstairs,

1864
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:18,160
Rasputin has lurched into the snowbound 
courtyard in his running away and he's 

1865
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:20,150
yelling,
you so offs first name,

1866
01:49:20,151 --> 01:49:23,360
who's also the prince.
It's Prince yourself of Felix Felix.

1867
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:26,260
I'll tell this,
I'll read everything you know he's going

1868
01:49:26,261 --> 01:49:29,510
to tattle on the prince for trying to 
kill him.

1869
01:49:29,930 --> 01:49:34,930
And people opened.
Fire the prince among others at 

1870
01:49:34,930 --> 01:49:35,390
Rasputin,
as he flees Mrs a couple times,

1871
01:49:35,391 --> 01:49:40,391
then hits him somewhere in the back and 
then they run up to the body that's on 

1872
01:49:40,391 --> 01:49:41,990
the ground and they put a bullet through
his forehead.

1873
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:45,700
Then we're told they wrap him up in a,
tie them up,

1874
01:49:45,740 --> 01:49:48,160
then wrap him up in a carpet than go to 
a nearby

1875
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:52,510
river where there's ice and throw them 
through a hole on the ice and you know,

1876
01:49:52,511 --> 01:49:55,840
hope floats to Finland.
Of course he doesn't.

1877
01:49:56,380 --> 01:50:01,380
They find him in a few days.
They dragged the body out and and the 

1878
01:50:01,380 --> 01:50:01,380
myth of this story,
and again,

1879
01:50:01,380 --> 01:50:05,110
it's so much better with the myth,
is that during the autopsy,

1880
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:10,440
they found water in his lungs and his 
body untied as though he had freed 

1881
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:13,300
himself and only at the end drown.
So the cyanide edema didn't work.

1882
01:50:13,301 --> 01:50:15,160
They shot him multiple times.
It didn't work.

1883
01:50:15,310 --> 01:50:17,620
They threw him in the river and it 
almost didn't work.

1884
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:23,350
Historians say that the shot to his 
forehead almost certainly killed him.

1885
01:50:23,351 --> 01:50:24,790
It's right in the middle of his 
forehead.

1886
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:31,150
And it's possible that the cyanide was 
old or that never got put in his drinks,

1887
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:34,660
or who knows,
but it adds to the legend of Rasputin.

1888
01:50:35,970 --> 01:50:39,540
There's a warning before he dies that he
gives to the royal family.

1889
01:50:39,541 --> 01:50:42,600
Supposedly.
That also adds to his legend.

1890
01:50:43,170 --> 01:50:45,120
You know,
another one of these prophecies that are

1891
01:50:45,121 --> 01:50:49,800
sometimes uncannily correctly supposed 
to have said to the royal couple quote,

1892
01:50:50,220 --> 01:50:54,810
if I die or you desert me,
you will lose your son and your crown in

1893
01:50:54,811 --> 01:50:55,770
six months.

1894
01:50:57,350 --> 01:51:02,180
Rasputin is right again from beyond the 
grave.

1895
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:11,120
This period in the first world war,
his timeline about the time period 

1896
01:51:11,120 --> 01:51:12,750
Rasputin dies,
you know,

1897
01:51:12,751 --> 01:51:14,850
take a couple of months before he was 
assassinated,

1898
01:51:14,851 --> 01:51:19,851
a couple of months afterwards.
That really is the first world war is 

1899
01:51:19,851 --> 01:51:20,130
crowded our.
And you know,

1900
01:51:20,131 --> 01:51:23,580
that's what Theodore Roosevelt called 
his combat in the Spanish American war.

1901
01:51:23,790 --> 01:51:28,020
He was trying to describe these large 
number of events that was crammed into a

1902
01:51:28,021 --> 01:51:30,000
short period of time.
He said it was his crowded,

1903
01:51:30,001 --> 01:51:33,120
our,
the period from about November 19,

1904
01:51:33,121 --> 01:51:36,660
16 to April 19,
17 is the first world war was crowded.

1905
01:51:36,661 --> 01:51:40,920
Our huge number of events compressed in 
a short period of time.

1906
01:51:41,580 --> 01:51:46,580
These events are all connected though to
the various themes we've examined 

1907
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:50,961
individually so far.
The United States and the United States 

1908
01:51:50,961 --> 01:51:51,300
involvement in Mexico,

1909
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:57,840
the submarines,
the high level diplomatic activity and 

1910
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:01,471
maneuvering,
and the train wreck that's about to 

1911
01:52:01,471 --> 01:52:02,950
happen with Russia.
This all comes to a head,

1912
01:52:02,951 --> 01:52:06,250
as we said in January,
late January 19,

1913
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:11,260
17.
Woodrow Wilson gives his peace without 

1914
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:11,740
victory speech.
While he's doing that,

1915
01:52:12,310 --> 01:52:17,310
the Germans are already behind the 
scenes prepping for their February first

1916
01:52:18,461 --> 01:52:23,461
resumption of unrestricted warfare.
They've pulled the trigger on that 

1917
01:52:23,461 --> 01:52:27,301
because they had given the high level 
politicians in Germany the go ahead to 

1918
01:52:27,431 --> 01:52:29,680
try some peace maneuvering.
Of course,

1919
01:52:29,681 --> 01:52:34,681
they were told that the peace 
maneuvering doesn't when we let the 

1920
01:52:34,681 --> 01:52:36,370
submarines go,
the submarines are slated to go February

1921
01:52:36,371 --> 01:52:41,371
first,
1917 now because Germany was reasonably 

1922
01:52:43,481 --> 01:52:46,190
sure as was everyone else.
Pretty much

1923
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:49,940
that if they started shooting at every 
ship on the high seas,

1924
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:55,030
the United States was going to get 
dragged into the war because Americans 

1925
01:52:55,030 --> 01:52:55,030
would die.
American ships would go down.

1926
01:52:55,030 --> 01:52:59,860
It was pretty much inevitable.
So the Germans started working on some 

1927
01:52:59,860 --> 01:53:01,520
contingency plans in January 19,
17,

1928
01:53:01,690 --> 01:53:02,300
you know,
again,

1929
01:53:02,301 --> 01:53:07,301
right around the same time Wilson's 
proposing piece for all men and all his 

1930
01:53:07,301 --> 01:53:10,601
high minded sentiments.
The Germans are sending a telegram to 

1931
01:53:11,421 --> 01:53:16,421
their ambassador in Mexico,
giving their ambassador in Mexico some 

1932
01:53:16,421 --> 01:53:20,681
instructions on what to do just in case 
the United States comes into the war and

1933
01:53:21,411 --> 01:53:26,411
starts fighting Germany.
The telegram from the German foreign 

1934
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:33,070
secretary,
a guy named Arthur Zimmerman to the 

1935
01:53:33,070 --> 01:53:35,840
ambassador of Mexico,
says this quote,

1936
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:39,020
we intend to begin on the first of 
February,

1937
01:53:39,200 --> 01:53:44,200
unrestricted submarine warfare.
We shall endeavor in spite of this to 

1938
01:53:44,200 --> 01:53:45,380
keep the United States of America 
neutral.

1939
01:53:45,680 --> 01:53:50,680
In the event of this not succeeding,
we make Mexico a proposal of alliance on

1940
01:53:50,841 --> 01:53:53,330
the following basis,
make war together,

1941
01:53:53,510 --> 01:53:58,510
make peace together,
generous financial support and an 

1942
01:53:58,510 --> 01:54:01,661
understanding on our part that Mexico is
to reconquer the last territory in 

1943
01:54:01,661 --> 01:54:04,190
Texas,
New Mexico and Arizona.

1944
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:09,580
The settlement in detail is left to you.
You will inform the president of the 

1945
01:54:09,580 --> 01:54:13,451
above most secretly as soon as the 
outbreak of war with the United States 

1946
01:54:13,451 --> 01:54:16,070
of America is certain.
And add the suggestion that he should on

1947
01:54:16,071 --> 01:54:21,071
his own initiative,
invite Japan to immediate adherence and 

1948
01:54:21,071 --> 01:54:23,000
at the same time mediate between Japan 
and ourselves.

1949
01:54:23,330 --> 01:54:27,140
Please call the president attention to 
the fact that the ruthless employment of

1950
01:54:27,141 --> 01:54:32,141
our submarines now offers the prospect 
of compelling England in a few months to

1951
01:54:32,241 --> 01:54:34,010
make peace and quote.

1952
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:41,100
So there's a note suggesting that Mexico
go to war as part of the central powers 

1953
01:54:41,951 --> 01:54:44,500
against the United States.
If the United States gets into the war,

1954
01:54:44,710 --> 01:54:49,710
what's more?
They talk about getting Japan on board 

1955
01:54:49,710 --> 01:54:52,981
too.
That was one of the United States is 

1956
01:54:52,981 --> 01:54:52,981
great worries.
By the way.

1957
01:54:52,981 --> 01:54:54,760
The Japanese had scared the Americans.
There's all these theories from American

1958
01:54:54,761 --> 01:54:59,761
planners that maybe they could go take 
the Panama Canal and come up through 

1959
01:54:59,761 --> 01:55:00,700
Mexico mean there's all these war plan 
kind of fantasies,

1960
01:55:01,030 --> 01:55:06,030
but the idea that Japan could be brought
in and flipped because they're on the 

1961
01:55:06,030 --> 01:55:10,531
allied side.
The Germans are talking about flipping 

1962
01:55:10,531 --> 01:55:12,481
the Japanese,
making them on the central powers to 

1963
01:55:12,481 --> 01:55:12,481
having the Japanese attack the 
Americans,

1964
01:55:12,481 --> 01:55:14,470
the Mexicans attack the Americans.
If nothing else,

1965
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:19,740
that keeps the Americans busy so they're
not over there fighting Germans in 

1966
01:55:19,740 --> 01:55:19,740
Europe.

1967
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:25,760
If you're playing a board game here of 
risk or something that's not a bad idea,

1968
01:55:26,041 --> 01:55:27,300
you know,
there's a game called diplomacy.

1969
01:55:27,301 --> 01:55:30,120
Not a bad move if you're playing the 
game called diplomacy,

1970
01:55:30,660 --> 01:55:32,760
proud ms dot all kinds of variables in 
real life,

1971
01:55:33,090 --> 01:55:35,670
not taken into account in the game of 
diplomacy.

1972
01:55:35,671 --> 01:55:40,671
One of them is that your enemies might 
be tapping into the cable that you use 

1973
01:55:40,921 --> 01:55:45,450
to send a secret message like from 
Germany to Mexico.

1974
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:51,440
The British got it,
snatched it right off of the American 

1975
01:55:52,770 --> 01:55:55,170
Atlantic cable,
which they were tapping.

1976
01:55:56,100 --> 01:55:59,430
I think we mentioned in an earlier 
episode that British may be the,

1977
01:55:59,490 --> 01:56:03,810
the best espionage code breaker people 
of all time.

1978
01:56:04,710 --> 01:56:09,710
When the war starts,
they cut the German transatlantic 

1979
01:56:09,710 --> 01:56:09,710
cables.
Uh,

1980
01:56:09,710 --> 01:56:10,590
Germany can't send telegraph messages 
across the Atlantic.

1981
01:56:10,770 --> 01:56:13,950
So they work out deals to borrow other 
people's cable.

1982
01:56:13,951 --> 01:56:18,951
Sometimes the United States let them use
the US cable for just messages.

1983
01:56:19,320 --> 01:56:22,530
Woodrow Wilson thought would,
would maybe foster peace,

1984
01:56:22,531 --> 01:56:27,531
right?
He wants to the Germans to have an open 

1985
01:56:27,531 --> 01:56:29,451
channel to him.
So the Germans used the American cable 

1986
01:56:29,451 --> 01:56:32,691
to send a message to Mexico offering 
some American states to them if they 

1987
01:56:32,691 --> 01:56:34,630
come in the war by attacking the United 
States.

1988
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:38,460
A little ironic there.
Now the British have a problem.

1989
01:56:39,750 --> 01:56:44,750
They can't tell the Americans about this
cable right away because then you're 

1990
01:56:44,750 --> 01:56:47,130
going to get all these embarrassing 
questions like how'd you get the cable?

1991
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:49,830
And then the British would have to say 
if they were going to be truthful.

1992
01:56:49,831 --> 01:56:53,070
Well,
we tapped into your cable and we've been

1993
01:56:53,071 --> 01:56:57,750
reading your messages for the whole war.
Can't quite say that too easily.

1994
01:56:57,930 --> 01:57:00,120
So by hook or by Crook,
it's a great story.

1995
01:57:00,121 --> 01:57:01,830
Barbara Tuchman wrote a whole book on 
it.

1996
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:07,080
Um,
the British figure out a way to sort of 

1997
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:07,560
hide the source of,
you know,

1998
01:57:07,561 --> 01:57:08,820
how they got this cable.

1999
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:12,600
They give it to the Americans.
Woodrow Wilson is shocked.

2000
01:57:12,780 --> 01:57:15,990
Just shocked that this would happen and 
understand the context,

2001
01:57:15,991 --> 01:57:17,880
right?
This is the very month,

2002
01:57:17,910 --> 01:57:22,910
January 1917 that American military 
forces are finally withdrawing from the 

2003
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:26,340
Poncho via expedition,
right?

2004
01:57:26,341 --> 01:57:31,341
This attempt to go get this terrorist us
settlers in Arizona and New Mexico and 

2005
01:57:31,341 --> 01:57:36,141
Texas would have called you and and the 
US forest kind of comes back with their 

2006
01:57:36,141 --> 01:57:36,750
tail between their legs.
They didn't get Poncho via,

2007
01:57:36,751 --> 01:57:39,900
they killed a bunch of his men,
but despite,

2008
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:44,960
you know,
high public praising of everything 

2009
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:46,680
involved General John Black Jack 
pershing says it wasn't a very memorable

2010
01:57:46,681 --> 01:57:49,020
period in American history.
Nonetheless,

2011
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:51,830
it made the Mexicans mad as hell.
And,

2012
01:57:51,831 --> 01:57:55,410
and the US almost went to war with 
Mexico twice in two years.

2013
01:57:55,680 --> 01:58:00,680
In 1914 US troops occupied the city of 
Vera Cruz and about 200 people died in 

2014
01:58:00,680 --> 01:58:01,860
that little endeavor,
maybe closer to 300.

2015
01:58:02,330 --> 01:58:05,670
A nearly caused the war between the US 
and Mexico.

2016
01:58:05,670 --> 01:58:08,610
Then and then in this Poncho via 
expedition,

2017
01:58:08,620 --> 01:58:13,620
the u s crosses the border,
goes after a guy who is also the enemy 

2018
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:17,691
of Mexico's leader,
but it's so upset the Mexicans to have 

2019
01:58:17,691 --> 01:58:19,410
US troops in their country for any 
reason that that almost led to war.

2020
01:58:19,650 --> 01:58:24,650
And so just as you're getting your 
troops the very month you're getting 

2021
01:58:24,650 --> 01:58:27,291
your troops out of Mexico,
the Germans are sending them a telegram 

2022
01:58:27,291 --> 01:58:27,291
saying,
Hey,

2023
01:58:27,330 --> 01:58:28,710
want to go to war against the United 
States?

2024
01:58:28,711 --> 01:58:30,960
I'll give you three states,
will help you.

2025
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:37,040
It struck a nerve for Americans.
When Woodrow Wilson released that letter

2026
01:58:37,830 --> 01:58:42,260
publicly,
when the public first heard

2027
01:58:42,260 --> 01:58:47,260
about Germany's offered in Mexico,
their reaction was one that I think 

2028
01:58:47,260 --> 01:58:52,251
would,
would mirror the reaction of the 

2029
01:58:52,251 --> 01:58:52,251
American public in a similar situation 
today.

2030
01:58:52,251 --> 01:58:55,130
A large number of them thought that the 
telegram was a forgery,

2031
01:58:56,060 --> 01:59:01,060
that British intelligence was behind it.
That this was an attempt to trick the 

2032
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:04,991
American government and to affect 
American public opinion and make them 

2033
01:59:04,991 --> 01:59:05,660
more angry at Germany.
More pro war.

2034
01:59:06,860 --> 01:59:09,470
And it's interesting to speculate how 
much you know,

2035
01:59:09,471 --> 01:59:11,180
that sort of perception would have 
stayed that way.

2036
01:59:11,181 --> 01:59:16,181
If the German foreign secretary,
Arthur Zimmerman hadn't done something 

2037
01:59:16,181 --> 01:59:16,181
in early March,
19,

2038
01:59:16,181 --> 01:59:20,861
17 that looks inexplicably,
he admitted that the telegram had been 

2039
01:59:22,221 --> 01:59:27,221
sent and that it was genuine twice.
The second time he,

2040
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:32,880
he said he hoped the American people 
would understand that this was only to 

2041
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:35,540
come into effect if war broke out 
between Germany and the United States as

2042
01:59:35,541 --> 01:59:36,380
a way of saying,
you know,

2043
01:59:36,381 --> 01:59:37,580
you don't understand then,
right?

2044
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:42,880
The American people wouldn't understand 
the confirmation that the Zimmerman 

2045
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:46,931
telegram was indeed an official secret 
proposal from the German government to 

2046
01:59:46,931 --> 01:59:50,891
the Mexican government have set a ton of
Americans and undercut the cause of 

2047
01:59:50,891 --> 01:59:55,091
German Americans and Irish Americans who
were hoping to keep the United States 

2048
01:59:55,091 --> 01:59:58,031
neutral was another nail in the coffin 
of neutrality and a huge German misstep.

2049
02:00:02,720 --> 02:00:07,720
In fact,
the whole decision to unleash the 

2050
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:09,740
submarines when they did was a bad 
decision by Germany.

2051
02:00:10,190 --> 02:00:15,190
If they had only waited a little while.
Longer events would have happened that 

2052
02:00:15,681 --> 02:00:20,681
would have made that move unnecessary,
and if that's the move that gets the 

2053
02:00:20,930 --> 02:00:25,930
United States into the war,
than it would have made that event 

2054
02:00:25,930 --> 02:00:28,241
unnecessary.
Winston Churchill points out that the 

2055
02:00:28,820 --> 02:00:33,650
timing of the events that happened in 
March and April 19,

2056
02:00:33,651 --> 02:00:37,820
17 in his mind show the hand of destiny 
at work.

2057
02:00:37,821 --> 02:00:41,180
Here's how he frames what's about to 
happen and what's about to happen.

2058
02:00:41,181 --> 02:00:46,181
Ladies and gentlemen,
that will screw up everything here and 

2059
02:00:46,181 --> 02:00:49,150
you know,
set the stage for our modern world as 

2060
02:00:49,150 --> 02:00:49,670
much as the United States getting into 
this conflict will set the stage for the

2061
02:00:49,671 --> 02:00:52,400
modern world.
Russia has its revolution.

2062
02:00:54,670 --> 02:00:58,450
Churchill says this quote,
the beginning of 1917,

2063
02:00:58,660 --> 02:01:03,660
was marked by three stupendous events,
the German Declaration of unlimited you 

2064
02:01:03,761 --> 02:01:08,761
boat wore the intervention of the United
States and the Russian revolution taken 

2065
02:01:09,041 --> 02:01:11,560
together.
These events constitute the second great

2066
02:01:11,561 --> 02:01:16,561
climax of the war.
The order in which they were placed was 

2067
02:01:16,561 --> 02:01:20,161
decisive.
If the Russian revolution had occurred 

2068
02:01:20,161 --> 02:01:22,861
in January instead of in March,
or if alternatively the Germans had 

2069
02:01:22,861 --> 02:01:25,180
waited to declare unlimited you boat war
until the summer,

2070
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:30,440
there would have been no unlimited you 
boat war and consequently no 

2071
02:01:30,440 --> 02:01:33,871
intervention of the United States.
If the allies had been left to face the 

2072
02:01:33,871 --> 02:01:37,531
collapse of Russia without being 
sustained by the intervention of the 

2073
02:01:37,531 --> 02:01:41,760
United States.
It seems certain that France could not 

2074
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:43,990
have survived the year and the war would
have ended in a piece by negotiation or 

2075
02:01:43,990 --> 02:01:48,311
in other words,
a German victory had Russia lasted two 

2076
02:01:48,311 --> 02:01:51,971
months less,
had Germany refrained for two months 

2077
02:01:51,971 --> 02:01:54,851
more.
The whole course of events would have 

2078
02:01:54,851 --> 02:01:54,851
been revolutionized in this sequence.

2079
02:01:54,851 --> 02:01:59,500
We discerned the footprints of destiny.
Either Russian endurance or German 

2080
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:03,440
impatience was required to secure the 
entry of the United States and both were

2081
02:02:03,441 --> 02:02:08,150
forthcoming and quote.
As we've mentioned already,

2082
02:02:08,151 --> 02:02:12,530
the situation in Russia had been seeding
and simmering for quite some time.

2083
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:17,920
The straw that broke the camel's back 
was an almost complete breakdown of 

2084
02:02:17,920 --> 02:02:22,571
Russia's transportation system,
which had been withering since the war 

2085
02:02:22,571 --> 02:02:26,561
started,
and that had suffered terribly in the 

2086
02:02:26,561 --> 02:02:26,561
winter.
That had just happened.

2087
02:02:26,561 --> 02:02:29,780
Russia almost couldn't handle it's 
transportation needs in peace time.

2088
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:34,960
After several years of war,
there were whole cities that were not 

2089
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:36,860
receiving enough food.
One of them was the capitol Petrograd.

2090
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:39,800
Petrograd used to be called St 
Petersburg,

2091
02:02:39,801 --> 02:02:43,010
but when the war started,
that sounded a little too German,

2092
02:02:43,340 --> 02:02:46,640
so they changed it to Petrograd.
This is a city that will change its name

2093
02:02:46,641 --> 02:02:51,641
all the time during the communist years.
It will be known as Leningrad now at St 

2094
02:02:51,641 --> 02:02:51,800
Petersburg again.

2095
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:57,400
Nonetheless,
it's the big metropolis and it doesn't 

2096
02:02:57,400 --> 02:03:00,371
have enough food.
You take a bunch of people who were 

2097
02:03:00,371 --> 02:03:01,490
angry,
already add the war ad no food.

2098
02:03:01,910 --> 02:03:06,910
It's not surprising they were marching.
They'd been doing it all throughout 

2099
02:03:06,910 --> 02:03:10,121
1917.
His Irish historian William Mulligan 

2100
02:03:10,121 --> 02:03:11,120
points out quote from the beginning of 
1917,

2101
02:03:11,121 --> 02:03:14,480
there was a wave of strikes concentrated
in Petrograd.

2102
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:17,000
On the seventh of March,
30,000

2103
02:03:17,001 --> 02:03:19,490
workers were locked out of the feudal 
law of armaments,

2104
02:03:19,491 --> 02:03:21,830
plants in the city.
The following day,

2105
02:03:21,980 --> 02:03:26,980
International Women's Day,
women gathered in the viborg working 

2106
02:03:26,980 --> 02:03:29,060
class district protest against high bred
prices.

2107
02:03:29,300 --> 02:03:32,900
They marched past Finland station toward
Nevsky prospect,

2108
02:03:32,930 --> 02:03:35,420
by which time the strikers number to 
$100,000

2109
02:03:35,660 --> 02:03:40,660
down with the war down with the high 
cost of living down with hunger bread 

2110
02:03:40,881 --> 02:03:45,881
for the workers.
They cried as they marched through the 

2111
02:03:45,881 --> 02:03:48,161
city.
The protesters connected their 

2112
02:03:48,161 --> 02:03:48,710
experience of war with much broader 
political claims.

2113
02:03:48,950 --> 02:03:52,100
Although the crux of their complaints 
was the food supply crisis.

2114
02:03:52,310 --> 02:03:57,310
This material experience of war had 
political implications including the 

2115
02:03:57,310 --> 02:03:57,740
overthrow,
the czarist regime,

2116
02:03:57,920 --> 02:03:59,120
and an end,
the war.

2117
02:03:59,300 --> 02:04:03,620
It was possible in theory that the food 
supply system could be reformed,

2118
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:08,800
but the strikers knew the czarist regime
could no longer reform itself and quote 

2119
02:04:10,130 --> 02:04:15,130
British General Sir Henry Wilson Winter 
Russia during this time period and came 

2120
02:04:15,291 --> 02:04:19,550
back and reported to his peers,
you know,

2121
02:04:19,551 --> 02:04:23,300
concerning how the people in Russia felt
toward the czar and Zarina and told them

2122
02:04:23,301 --> 02:04:26,720
quote,
it seems as certain as anything can be,

2123
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:29,540
that the emperor and empress are riding 
for a fall.

2124
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:31,190
Everyone,
officers,

2125
02:04:31,191 --> 02:04:32,210
merchants,
ladies,

2126
02:04:32,211 --> 02:04:35,480
talk openly of the absolute necessity of
doing away with them.

2127
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:40,840
They've lost their people.
There are no bulls and now their army 

2128
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:43,940
and I see no hope for them.
There will be terrible trouble one day 

2129
02:04:43,940 --> 02:04:47,211
here and to quote,
there are open discussions amongst some 

2130
02:04:48,181 --> 02:04:53,181
at the higher levels of Russian society.
That terror attack should be made 

2131
02:04:53,181 --> 02:04:57,531
against the czar.
Someone stands up at the Duma and 

2132
02:04:57,531 --> 02:05:00,081
important person later in this story and
says that the czar needs to be removed 

2133
02:05:00,081 --> 02:05:01,920
by terrorist means if necessary.

2134
02:05:03,970 --> 02:05:08,970
Now it would be foolish to say that the 
royal court did not have their 

2135
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:10,090
supporters.
They did,

2136
02:05:10,450 --> 02:05:13,000
and they had people who didn't have a 
problem with,

2137
02:05:13,360 --> 02:05:14,230
you know,
when emperor,

2138
02:05:14,231 --> 02:05:16,630
but they had a problem with Nicholas the
second,

2139
02:05:16,720 --> 02:05:21,720
so there were all stripes in this idea 
that the czar needed to go and no 

2140
02:05:21,720 --> 02:05:26,521
consensus at all about what would take 
its place or how to get from here to 

2141
02:05:26,521 --> 02:05:26,521
there,

2142
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:32,300
Russia and knew how to have protests and
to revolt about a dozen years before 

2143
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:33,980
this time period.
They had the famous 19,

2144
02:05:33,981 --> 02:05:35,010
oh,
five revolution,

2145
02:05:35,550 --> 02:05:37,740
which had also come after,
you know,

2146
02:05:37,741 --> 02:05:42,180
Russian problems in a war and that 
revolution broke out.

2147
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:47,480
It got so serious.
The czar supposedly wrote out his 

2148
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:47,880
application letter.
He didn't deliver it,

2149
02:05:47,881 --> 02:05:51,630
but it was ready to go.
In that particular revolution.

2150
02:05:51,631 --> 02:05:55,710
The crowd marched on the Winter Palace 
with the czar was to align of troops who

2151
02:05:55,711 --> 02:05:57,930
opened fire on them,
killing hundreds of them.

2152
02:05:57,960 --> 02:06:02,960
It's known as bloody Sunday.
Bizarre had received intelligence 

2153
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:07,401
reports a few months before this event.
Saying that quote recently.

2154
02:06:08,761 --> 02:06:12,570
The conviction has been expressed 
without exception that we are on the eve

2155
02:06:12,571 --> 02:06:15,000
of great events in comparison with which
19,

2156
02:06:15,001 --> 02:06:15,690
oh,
five was,

2157
02:06:15,691 --> 02:06:20,691
but a toy and the quote that was from a 
police report that the czar received 

2158
02:06:21,180 --> 02:06:24,000
months before these demonstrations in 
March break out.

2159
02:06:25,250 --> 02:06:28,800
Now here's the thing,
you know as with many historical events,

2160
02:06:28,950 --> 02:06:33,950
they can be seemingly inevitable for the
longest time and still come as a 

2161
02:06:33,950 --> 02:06:37,701
surprise when they actually show up.
The people who were out in the streets 

2162
02:06:37,701 --> 02:06:38,220
March 7th,
March eighth,

2163
02:06:38,221 --> 02:06:43,221
which was international women's Day,
they didn't know that this is the 

2164
02:06:43,221 --> 02:06:43,221
revolution.
In fact,

2165
02:06:43,221 --> 02:06:48,021
the people on the scene point out that 
that's one of the tipping moments in 

2166
02:06:48,021 --> 02:06:48,810
this situation when people understand,
wait a minute,

2167
02:06:48,811 --> 02:06:51,750
this just isn't another demonstration 
like the kind we've been having.

2168
02:06:52,380 --> 02:06:54,690
This is the chance to topple the 
government.

2169
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:59,720
That's the big turning point and the 
actual moment of the turning point is 

2170
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:02,820
one of those really interesting,
almost turning point in history moments.

2171
02:07:03,030 --> 02:07:06,060
Revolutionaries like Leon Trotsky,
who certainly see it that way.

2172
02:07:06,061 --> 02:07:08,670
Spend a lot of time talking about that 
moment.

2173
02:07:08,671 --> 02:07:11,700
The tipping point in the revolution.
This is seven days by the way,

2174
02:07:11,701 --> 02:07:15,960
folks,
seven days for a 300 year old dynasty to

2175
02:07:15,961 --> 02:07:16,470
fall,

2176
02:07:18,230 --> 02:07:21,500
and it starts off with some factory 
strikers on March seventh.

2177
02:07:21,650 --> 02:07:23,090
By the way,
this is our calendar.

2178
02:07:23,270 --> 02:07:26,780
These events in Russia happening on on 
the old calendar in February,

2179
02:07:26,781 --> 02:07:31,781
so it's often called the February 
revolution and it makes the dating 

2180
02:07:31,781 --> 02:07:32,840
confusing as heck for someone like me.
Nonetheless,

2181
02:07:32,841 --> 02:07:35,890
March seventh by our calendar,
1917,

2182
02:07:36,050 --> 02:07:41,050
there is an industrial strike.
March eighth is international women's 

2183
02:07:41,050 --> 02:07:44,791
Day.
The women go out and strike and protest 

2184
02:07:44,791 --> 02:07:47,491
about the lack of brand and all this.
This seems to be key and so many people 

2185
02:07:47,491 --> 02:07:49,390
talk about it.
The fact that the women are doing this,

2186
02:07:49,391 --> 02:07:52,060
a lot of these women are the wives of 
soldiers at the front,

2187
02:07:52,390 --> 02:07:54,460
which gives them a huge amount of 
credibility,

2188
02:07:54,461 --> 02:07:59,410
as you might imagine with other soldiers
and they're out on international women's

2189
02:07:59,411 --> 02:08:00,490
Day.
On the eighth,

2190
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:03,760
on the ninth,
the women come back out,

2191
02:08:03,790 --> 02:08:08,530
bring more people and go to factories 
and shops and businesses and grabbed the

2192
02:08:08,531 --> 02:08:13,531
workers out and have them join the 
strike and the crowd swells to at least 

2193
02:08:13,531 --> 02:08:13,531
twice.

2194
02:08:13,531 --> 02:08:15,250
What it was the day before,
by the next day,

2195
02:08:15,670 --> 02:08:20,670
the industry of Russia's capital is 
paralyzed and to show you how out of 

2196
02:08:21,671 --> 02:08:26,671
touch the Zarina is with all this,
she writes in her diary on March 10th 

2197
02:08:27,100 --> 02:08:32,100
about the troubles in the capital and 
she's basically in charge and the 

2198
02:08:32,100 --> 02:08:35,590
capital quote,
this is a hooligan movement.

2199
02:08:35,740 --> 02:08:40,740
Young people run and shout that there is
no bread simply to create excitement 

2200
02:08:40,740 --> 02:08:43,120
along with the workers who prevent 
others from working.

2201
02:08:43,300 --> 02:08:46,450
If the weather was very cold,
they would probably all stay at home,

2202
02:08:46,690 --> 02:08:50,710
but all this will pass and become calm 
if only the Duma will behave itself.

2203
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:54,190
And quote the Duma is the Russian 
legislature,

2204
02:08:54,191 --> 02:08:59,191
which I think I said earlier,
has about one percent of the power in 

2205
02:08:59,191 --> 02:08:59,191
the system and his art has about 99 
percent.

2206
02:08:59,230 --> 02:09:04,230
And is our arena is complaining that the
dumas misusing its one percent sort of 

2207
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:05,740
Russian revolutionary.

2208
02:09:05,740 --> 02:09:10,740
Leon Trotsky compares her pretty 
convincingly to Marie Antoinette before 

2209
02:09:10,740 --> 02:09:13,330
the French Revolution.
Let them eat cake statement there.

2210
02:09:13,630 --> 02:09:18,160
And she and the czar and before he died,
Rasputin liked this one.

2211
02:09:18,220 --> 02:09:23,220
Russian minister,
a guy named protocol pop off and so he 

2212
02:09:23,220 --> 02:09:26,851
begins to sort of act as the Zarina's 
minister in all this situation and 

2213
02:09:26,851 --> 02:09:29,260
according to someone the scene,
it's anger at him.

2214
02:09:29,410 --> 02:09:34,410
That prompts a lot of this activity.
The events that are happening starting 

2215
02:09:34,451 --> 02:09:39,451
really on March eighth and then March 
9th are large enough to be a big news 

2216
02:09:39,451 --> 02:09:40,840
story and the international media is 
there.

2217
02:09:41,110 --> 02:09:45,100
There are magazine journalists there,
a newspaper reporters from Britain,

2218
02:09:45,101 --> 02:09:46,150
France,
places like that,

2219
02:09:46,151 --> 02:09:49,720
telling the folks back home what's going
on in the Russian capital.

2220
02:09:49,960 --> 02:09:54,960
One is a British newspaper man named 
John Pollock and he writes about the 

2221
02:09:54,971 --> 02:09:57,910
women protesting.
He calls them bread riots.

2222
02:09:58,630 --> 02:10:00,910
He writes,
and this is about March eight,

2223
02:10:01,180 --> 02:10:04,110
and my apologies for my Russian 
pronunciation quote.

2224
02:10:04,630 --> 02:10:07,600
The rioting was so far confined to the 
vibe Berg side,

2225
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:10,000
the chief workman's quarter of 
Petrograd,

2226
02:10:10,420 --> 02:10:13,750
but in the center of the tramway service
had already become irregular.

2227
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:16,750
On the ninth,
the rioters stopped the trams across the

2228
02:10:16,751 --> 02:10:21,751
river terrorizing the drivers and 
throwing parts of the mechanism away so 

2229
02:10:21,751 --> 02:10:24,880
that the service groups still more 
intermittent visits were paid to all the

2230
02:10:24,881 --> 02:10:28,720
factories and the hands were called out 
in sympathetic strike against the sudden

2231
02:10:28,721 --> 02:10:33,721
food shortage on this day to a prefect 
of police who threatened the crowd was 

2232
02:10:33,721 --> 02:10:34,070
killed,

2233
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:36,950
strong coast act squadrons,
patrol Petrograd,

2234
02:10:37,100 --> 02:10:42,100
and there was a collision on the Nevsky 
in which the cost actually used their 

2235
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:45,371
whips,
but they told the crowd that they would 

2236
02:10:45,371 --> 02:10:45,380
not shoot so long as they only asked for
bread,

2237
02:10:45,590 --> 02:10:50,590
alarmed at the attitude of the Cossacks.
The authorities on the 10th brought 

2238
02:10:50,590 --> 02:10:52,100
troops of the line into the streets to 
support the police,

2239
02:10:52,280 --> 02:10:55,730
posted machine guns on the Nevsky and 
stopped traffic across it.

2240
02:10:55,731 --> 02:11:00,731
At many points and quote John Pawlik 
then points out it sounds like a rumor,

2241
02:11:02,911 --> 02:11:07,911
but what?
What the Russian minister working for 

2242
02:11:07,911 --> 02:11:10,371
this arena is supposed to have said when
his methods for dealing with this 

2243
02:11:10,371 --> 02:11:12,270
uprising or being questioned.
Here's what Paul writes.

2244
02:11:12,271 --> 02:11:16,170
He says,
quote Frodo popoff approached by one who

2245
02:11:16,171 --> 02:11:19,440
endeavored to convince him of the 
madness of his methods only answered,

2246
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:22,950
do you know how splendidly machine guns 
work from the roof?

2247
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:28,760
End Quote,
pollock says that the first serious 

2248
02:11:29,481 --> 02:11:34,481
bloodshed happens on March 10th when 
police opened fire on a group of 

2249
02:11:34,481 --> 02:11:38,411
protestors and killer wound 50.
The czar is now told about problems at 

2250
02:11:39,651 --> 02:11:40,490
the capital.
Remember,

2251
02:11:40,491 --> 02:11:44,840
he's off kind of at the front,
not in this capital of his.

2252
02:11:44,841 --> 02:11:47,780
He's letting his wife sort of run the 
show with this product pop off guy.

2253
02:11:48,190 --> 02:11:49,610
Uh,
the czar finds out about it.

2254
02:11:49,611 --> 02:11:53,210
They tell them things are bad.
He issues an order that basically says,

2255
02:11:53,211 --> 02:11:54,200
make it stop.

2256
02:11:56,160 --> 02:12:00,630
That order appears on lamp posts and all
over the city.

2257
02:12:00,780 --> 02:12:03,510
The next morning when the rioters and 
protesters,

2258
02:12:03,860 --> 02:12:07,610
um,
muster to protests for the day,

2259
02:12:07,611 --> 02:12:11,360
they see this message from the head of 
Petro grads.

2260
02:12:11,600 --> 02:12:15,390
Military garrison quote,
during the last days,

2261
02:12:15,480 --> 02:12:20,480
disorders have taken place in Petrograd,
followed by force and assaults on the 

2262
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:22,170
lives of soldiers and members of the 
police.

2263
02:12:22,410 --> 02:12:25,140
I forbid,
every kind of assembly in the streets.

2264
02:12:25,290 --> 02:12:30,290
I warned the population of Petrograd 
that commands have been issued and 

2265
02:12:30,290 --> 02:12:34,191
repeated to the troops to use their arms
and not to stop short of anything in 

2266
02:12:34,191 --> 02:12:37,200
order to assure a tranquility in the 
capital end.

2267
02:12:37,201 --> 02:12:42,201
Quote,
John Pollock is out in the streets that 

2268
02:12:42,201 --> 02:12:43,030
day when he writes,
quote

2269
02:12:43,730 --> 02:12:45,140
Sunday,
March Eleventh,

2270
02:12:45,141 --> 02:12:50,141
began nervously.
There were soldiers everywhere in the 

2271
02:12:50,141 --> 02:12:51,290
streets and strong bodies held in 
reserve and courtyards.

2272
02:12:51,560 --> 02:12:56,560
By now,
the trams had all stopped and it was 

2273
02:12:56,560 --> 02:12:56,960
hardly possible to find a car.
No newspapers appeared.

2274
02:12:57,170 --> 02:12:58,370
About 3:30
PM,

2275
02:12:58,371 --> 02:13:02,030
the troops begin to clear the streets 
around the Nevsky at the bayonet point,

2276
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:07,240
and soon afterwards the police turned 
their machine guns onto a crowd at the 

2277
02:13:07,240 --> 02:13:09,500
same place as the day before,
but with more deadly effect.

2278
02:13:09,740 --> 02:13:14,740
A Caucasian officer who was nearby 
estimating the number of dead at 300 at 

2279
02:13:14,781 --> 02:13:17,360
the same time,
heavy firing took place further down the

2280
02:13:17,361 --> 02:13:19,790
Nevsky and opposite the Khazan 
Cathedral.

2281
02:13:19,910 --> 02:13:22,010
Several score.
More people were killed.

2282
02:13:22,190 --> 02:13:24,650
The crowd here retaliated with pistol 
shots,

2283
02:13:24,830 --> 02:13:28,070
another prefix and a colonel of the 
police besides policemen,

2284
02:13:28,071 --> 02:13:30,620
the various innocent passengers by being
killed.

2285
02:13:31,170 --> 02:13:32,070
It was significant.

2286
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:34,410
He writes that soldiers were seen among 
the crowd,

2287
02:13:34,411 --> 02:13:39,411
firing on the police,
and a number of men in some 14 officers 

2288
02:13:39,411 --> 02:13:42,981
are different.
Detachments were arrested for refusing 

2289
02:13:42,981 --> 02:13:43,830
to support the police with arms on the 
same afternoon,

2290
02:13:43,920 --> 02:13:46,620
a drunken officer of the [inaudible] 
regiment named nameless,

2291
02:13:46,621 --> 02:13:49,170
gavage ordered his men to fire on the 
crowd.

2292
02:13:49,380 --> 02:13:54,380
They refuse,
but less gavish forced one of the 

2293
02:13:54,380 --> 02:13:54,780
soldiers to obey his shot,
killed a woman.

2294
02:13:55,290 --> 02:13:55,890
And to quote

2295
02:13:57,760 --> 02:14:00,250
the hurting of women,
as I said,

2296
02:14:00,251 --> 02:14:05,251
seems to be an important part of this 
affair because it's mentioned by 

2297
02:14:05,251 --> 02:14:05,410
everyone.
Trotsky says,

2298
02:14:05,411 --> 02:14:10,411
the rumor that was going around was that
a police officer struck a woman with a 

2299
02:14:10,841 --> 02:14:15,841
club and that this was witnessed by the 
cassettes who were sort of sitting by 

2300
02:14:15,841 --> 02:14:16,710
neutrally,
uh,

2301
02:14:16,720 --> 02:14:19,780
they're there to kind of add some muscle
to the mix,

2302
02:14:19,781 --> 02:14:24,781
but the army's kind of standing by while
the hated police and the public face 

2303
02:14:24,781 --> 02:14:28,711
off.
And Trotsky says whether or not it 

2304
02:14:28,711 --> 02:14:28,930
really happened.
Everybody believed that a woman had been

2305
02:14:28,931 --> 02:14:32,800
assaulted in front of the costs x and 
the Cossacks drove the police away.

2306
02:14:32,801 --> 02:14:34,720
Who did it.
Now,

2307
02:14:34,721 --> 02:14:37,870
one of the things that if you've watched
recent revolutions,

2308
02:14:37,871 --> 02:14:40,990
you'll notice that oftentimes some 
incident will happen,

2309
02:14:41,200 --> 02:14:46,200
that the demonstrators and protesters 
and rioters will sort of cling to some 

2310
02:14:46,631 --> 02:14:51,631
sort of symbol generally from the event 
that becomes almost like a high sign 

2311
02:14:52,121 --> 02:14:56,680
that protesters use and that they rally 
around according to Trotsky.

2312
02:14:57,040 --> 02:15:02,040
What it was in this revolution was a 
cavalryman winking to the crowd

2313
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:08,500
and that this wink became sort of a 
symbol of what was going on.

2314
02:15:08,501 --> 02:15:13,501
Here's the way Trotsky explained it,
and remember Trotsky's or revolutionary 

2315
02:15:13,501 --> 02:15:17,101
for him,
this is a hugely heroic tale and that's 

2316
02:15:17,101 --> 02:15:17,980
the way he tells it and I think we're 
all colored.

2317
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:21,790
At least those of us who know what's 
coming by what's coming.

2318
02:15:22,450 --> 02:15:27,450
This revolution's going to devolve into 
something very terrible and a lot of us 

2319
02:15:27,450 --> 02:15:31,810
look back on this event thinking that 
that's how we should view the removal of

2320
02:15:31,811 --> 02:15:36,811
what came before communism.
And yet there was a period after this 

2321
02:15:36,811 --> 02:15:40,801
revolution where Russia was on the road 
to becoming something more like the 

2322
02:15:40,900 --> 02:15:45,900
United States.
And so getting rid of a czarist regime 

2323
02:15:45,900 --> 02:15:49,180
that these people seem to hate,
like Saddam Hussein was initially viewed

2324
02:15:49,570 --> 02:15:51,880
as a plus and the reporter on the scene,
for example,

2325
02:15:51,881 --> 02:15:56,881
for the British press,
he's thoroughly in favor of something 

2326
02:15:56,881 --> 02:15:59,780
replacing this regime.
The United States is too,

2327
02:15:59,781 --> 02:16:04,781
by the way.
One of the problems the United States 

2328
02:16:04,781 --> 02:16:06,911
has with joining the allies are being 
associated with the allies is not 

2329
02:16:06,911 --> 02:16:10,550
Britain and France who they feel very 
close to in a lot of ways it's Russia to

2330
02:16:10,551 --> 02:16:15,551
them.
Russia is the same kind of militant 

2331
02:16:15,551 --> 02:16:17,600
autocracy that US propaganda paints the 
Germans as

2332
02:16:19,210 --> 02:16:24,210
the idea of the czar going away to be 
replaced by some sort of constitutional 

2333
02:16:24,210 --> 02:16:25,370
government.
Makes a lot of people in the allied camp

2334
02:16:25,371 --> 02:16:28,270
sit up and cheer for the protesters.

2335
02:16:30,180 --> 02:16:32,900
Now in the story by Trotsky of the 
winking Casech,

2336
02:16:33,150 --> 02:16:38,150
he explains that the officers or the 
cost x kind of forced them to charge 

2337
02:16:38,150 --> 02:16:41,691
into the crowd at one point.
But as soon as the officers passed by 

2338
02:16:41,691 --> 02:16:44,841
and scattered the crowd,
the regular costs x are very careful 

2339
02:16:44,841 --> 02:16:46,110
moving through with their horses not to 
hurt anyone.

2340
02:16:46,620 --> 02:16:50,190
And Trotsky writes,
quote behind them,

2341
02:16:50,191 --> 02:16:52,500
filling the whole width of the prospect,
Gallup,

2342
02:16:52,501 --> 02:16:57,501
the cossacks decisive moment,
but the horseman cautiously in a long 

2343
02:16:57,501 --> 02:17:00,480
ribbon rode through the court or just 
made by the officers.

2344
02:17:00,630 --> 02:17:03,650
Some of them smiled,
he quotes a protester,

2345
02:17:03,850 --> 02:17:08,850
Kaya Rev recalls,
and one of them gave the workers a good 

2346
02:17:08,850 --> 02:17:08,850
wink.
This wink,

2347
02:17:08,850 --> 02:17:11,010
Trotsky says,
was not without meaning.

2348
02:17:11,250 --> 02:17:13,260
The workers were in bold and with a 
friendly,

2349
02:17:13,350 --> 02:17:17,390
not hostile kind of assurance and 
slightly infected the contacts with it.

2350
02:17:17,670 --> 02:17:22,670
The one who winked found imitators in 
spite of renewed efforts from the 

2351
02:17:22,670 --> 02:17:22,670
officers.

2352
02:17:22,670 --> 02:17:25,440
The Cossacks without openly breaking 
discipline,

2353
02:17:25,650 --> 02:17:30,090
fail to force the crowd to disperse,
but flowed through it in streams.

2354
02:17:30,210 --> 02:17:35,210
This was repeated three or four times 
and brought the two sides even closer 

2355
02:17:35,210 --> 02:17:35,690
together.
Individual costs.

2356
02:17:35,700 --> 02:17:40,700
X began to reply to the workers 
questions and even to enter into 

2357
02:17:40,700 --> 02:17:42,270
momentary conversations with them of 
discipline.

2358
02:17:42,271 --> 02:17:47,271
There remained but a thin,
transparent shell that threatened to 

2359
02:17:47,271 --> 02:17:50,541
break through any second.
The officers hastened to separate their 

2360
02:17:50,541 --> 02:17:53,100
patrol from the workers and abandoned 
the idea of dispersing them lying to the

2361
02:17:53,101 --> 02:17:58,101
coast,
x out across the street as a barrier to 

2362
02:17:58,101 --> 02:17:58,890
prevent the demonstrators from getting 
to the center and to quote.

2363
02:17:59,160 --> 02:18:04,160
He then tells the story though about how
these costs x will allow themselves to 

2364
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:07,071
be used as a mounted barrier,
but they don't stop the protestors from 

2365
02:18:07,071 --> 02:18:10,841
diving under the horses' bellies.
The fact that the Cossacks traditionally

2366
02:18:12,061 --> 02:18:17,061
these czarist crowd control mechanism 
appear less than enthusiastic about 

2367
02:18:18,031 --> 02:18:23,031
carrying out their traditional role,
convinces the government that they have 

2368
02:18:23,031 --> 02:18:25,300
to bring in the troops.
The garrison of Petrograd is like 150,

2369
02:18:25,301 --> 02:18:27,000
a hundred 60,000
men,

2370
02:18:27,270 --> 02:18:32,270
so they've got the people and they call 
them in and March 11th is the key day 

2371
02:18:32,270 --> 02:18:34,230
because that's the day that elements of 
one famous unit,

2372
02:18:34,231 --> 02:18:39,231
a training squadron that's called open 
fire and killed those people that the 

2373
02:18:39,231 --> 02:18:39,780
British reporter was talking about.

2374
02:18:41,380 --> 02:18:46,380
Now the people of Petrograd are 
appealing to the troops as you heard 

2375
02:18:46,380 --> 02:18:47,170
earlier,
mingling with them,

2376
02:18:47,171 --> 02:18:52,171
talking to them.
They are walking up to the line of 

2377
02:18:52,171 --> 02:18:52,171
bayoneted troops,
you know,

2378
02:18:52,171 --> 02:18:53,710
in,
in ones and twos and sang brothers.

2379
02:18:53,711 --> 02:18:56,380
You're not really going to side with the
police and kill us.

2380
02:18:56,381 --> 02:18:58,660
Are you the women?
Again,

2381
02:18:58,661 --> 02:19:03,661
taking the lead in this whole thing are 
walking right up to the line of 

2382
02:19:03,661 --> 02:19:07,410
abandoned,
had troops and grabbing their rifles 

2383
02:19:07,410 --> 02:19:07,410
with the band that's on them and 
wrestling with them insane.

2384
02:19:07,410 --> 02:19:10,410
Join us.
It's very heroic.

2385
02:19:10,411 --> 02:19:15,411
There's a lot of that going on.
After the shootings in the street on 

2386
02:19:16,731 --> 02:19:18,320
March 11th,
uh,

2387
02:19:18,410 --> 02:19:23,410
citizens were told workers go up to 
members of one of these story units

2388
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:26,830
and tell them that,
you know,

2389
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:30,560
people in your unit opened fire 
yesterday against the people of the city

2390
02:19:30,620 --> 02:19:33,590
and told them what happened.
And then those troops went back to their

2391
02:19:33,591 --> 02:19:34,940
barracks.
And on the evening of March,

2392
02:19:34,941 --> 02:19:39,941
11th morning of March twelfth,
they had one of those moral crisis 

2393
02:19:39,941 --> 02:19:43,460
moments,
a key instant in any revolution.

2394
02:19:43,461 --> 02:19:48,461
A guy like Leon Trotsky would say.
And he describes it with almost heroic,

2395
02:19:49,930 --> 02:19:50,930
you know,
tones.

2396
02:19:51,260 --> 02:19:56,260
This,
this moment where this story unit 

2397
02:19:56,260 --> 02:19:58,730
confronts the reality that they shot a 
bunch of those poor people that had been

2398
02:19:58,731 --> 02:20:02,750
besieging them not to shoot the day 
before and they were going to have to go

2399
02:20:02,751 --> 02:20:06,050
out and do it again today.
Here's what Trotsky writes,

2400
02:20:06,051 --> 02:20:11,051
quote,
the soldiers had no more time for 

2401
02:20:11,051 --> 02:20:14,081
hesitation.
They were compelled to shoot yesterday 

2402
02:20:14,081 --> 02:20:17,350
and they would be again today.
The workers will not surrender or 

2403
02:20:17,350 --> 02:20:17,360
retreat under fire.

2404
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:19,580
They're still holding their own and with
them,

2405
02:20:19,581 --> 02:20:20,930
their wives,
mothers,

2406
02:20:20,931 --> 02:20:22,190
sisters,
sweethearts.

2407
02:20:22,610 --> 02:20:27,610
Yes,
and this is the very hour that they had 

2408
02:20:27,610 --> 02:20:27,920
so whispered about.
If only we could all get together.

2409
02:20:28,700 --> 02:20:33,700
Let me stop here at the Trotsky saying 
that all these people in the city had 

2410
02:20:33,700 --> 02:20:34,850
had thought about could desire be 
overthrown.

2411
02:20:34,851 --> 02:20:38,390
If only we could all get together that 
would happen and now these soldiers were

2412
02:20:38,391 --> 02:20:41,480
not taking part in that they were taking
part in crushing that.

2413
02:20:42,290 --> 02:20:47,290
If only we could all get together 
Trotsky rights and then at that moment 

2414
02:20:47,290 --> 02:20:50,060
of supreme agony in the unbearable fear 
of the coming day,

2415
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:55,240
the choking hatred of those who are 
imposing upon them the executioners 

2416
02:20:55,240 --> 02:20:56,780
role,
their ring out in the barrack room,

2417
02:20:56,781 --> 02:21:01,070
the first voices of open indignation and
in those voices to be forever,

2418
02:21:01,071 --> 02:21:06,071
nameless,
the whole army with relief and rapture 

2419
02:21:06,071 --> 02:21:07,370
recognizes itself,
thus dawned upon the earth,

2420
02:21:07,610 --> 02:21:11,630
the day of destruction of the Romanov 
monarchy and quote,

2421
02:21:13,070 --> 02:21:14,210
those soldiers shot there.

2422
02:21:14,210 --> 02:21:19,210
Officer ran out into the streets 
cheering and joined the people of 

2423
02:21:19,210 --> 02:21:24,161
Petrograd trying to overthrow the czar.
They encouraged other military units to 

2424
02:21:25,431 --> 02:21:30,431
follow.
Most of which by the end of March 

2425
02:21:30,431 --> 02:21:33,431
twelfth had done so.
The the garrison was melting away and 

2426
02:21:33,431 --> 02:21:37,091
joining the anti czarist rioters.
They ransack the artillery depot.

2427
02:21:39,261 --> 02:21:44,261
Then they go to the arsenal and break 
into it and take all the weapons than 

2428
02:21:44,261 --> 02:21:47,501
they burned down the court of Justice 
and a bunch of other government 

2429
02:21:47,501 --> 02:21:47,501
buildings.
And for March twelfth on,

2430
02:21:47,501 --> 02:21:52,361
you have open battles in the streets 
between the people in the army and the 

2431
02:21:52,361 --> 02:21:54,740
very large police forces.
You know,

2432
02:21:54,741 --> 02:21:59,741
we would call them today the secret 
police and all these police agencies 

2433
02:21:59,741 --> 02:22:01,460
that have set up machine guns at 
intersections.

2434
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:05,870
At this point.
The big question is,

2435
02:22:05,871 --> 02:22:10,871
what the heck is the czar doing?
The first thing is our tries to do is 

2436
02:22:11,151 --> 02:22:14,990
just get rid of the Duma and when the 
head of this powerless,

2437
02:22:14,991 --> 02:22:19,991
for all intents and purposes,
Russian legislature receives the order 

2438
02:22:19,991 --> 02:22:21,140
that the Duma is to disband.
He says no,

2439
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:25,890
and most of the Duma joins him in the 
street joining the revolution.

2440
02:22:27,530 --> 02:22:32,530
Next,
the czar gets on a train on the 13th of 

2441
02:22:32,530 --> 02:22:35,741
March and heads back toward the capital 
from the fighting front where he is in 

2442
02:22:35,741 --> 02:22:40,091
one of his typically strange moves.
He takes a lot longer to get there than 

2443
02:22:40,091 --> 02:22:44,231
he should have because he says he 
doesn't want to disrupt any of the war 

2444
02:22:44,231 --> 02:22:44,231
traffic heading to the front.
So his.

2445
02:22:44,240 --> 02:22:48,680
His train takes sort of the long way 
around and it ends up getting stopped on

2446
02:22:48,681 --> 02:22:53,681
the way to Petrograd because the 
revolution is spreading to other cities 

2447
02:22:53,681 --> 02:22:57,101
now and at one of these train stops,
the revolutionaries are stopping the 

2448
02:22:57,101 --> 02:23:00,641
train.
We're told that the czars advisors are 

2449
02:23:00,831 --> 02:23:02,960
bringing him telegrams from power 
brokers,

2450
02:23:02,961 --> 02:23:04,520
including,
for example,

2451
02:23:04,521 --> 02:23:06,670
um,
his cousin and others that he,

2452
02:23:06,700 --> 02:23:08,420
he needs to give up the crown.

2453
02:23:09,310 --> 02:23:13,990
And what's sort of interesting about 
Nicholas is that he almost seems willing

2454
02:23:13,991 --> 02:23:16,120
to do it.
There's a whole line of thinking,

2455
02:23:16,300 --> 02:23:21,300
you know,
if you read a lot of the primary 

2456
02:23:21,300 --> 02:23:22,621
sources,
he sometimes portrayed as this drunken 

2457
02:23:22,621 --> 02:23:22,621
tyrant,
you know,

2458
02:23:22,621 --> 02:23:26,330
and,
but when you read more modern day 

2459
02:23:26,330 --> 02:23:26,330
history,
he's a much more pitiable figure.

2460
02:23:26,330 --> 02:23:30,930
Churchill likes him and moved,
but Churchill would like Azhar but says 

2461
02:23:30,930 --> 02:23:31,420
great things about in this poor,
misunderstood person.

2462
02:23:31,540 --> 02:23:33,820
Of course he wasn't a great man,
just a good man.

2463
02:23:33,821 --> 02:23:38,821
And he talks about it in like that.
But the czar sort of seems to be 

2464
02:23:38,821 --> 02:23:41,150
relieved by the prospect of giving up 
the crown.

2465
02:23:41,390 --> 02:23:46,390
At first there's like five minutes of 
talk about giving it to his hemophiliac 

2466
02:23:46,390 --> 02:23:47,180
son,
but this art doesn't want that.

2467
02:23:47,270 --> 02:23:51,680
And interestingly enough in the 
abdication note to his people,

2468
02:23:51,860 --> 02:23:55,820
the czar specifically mentions not 
wanting to be parted from,

2469
02:23:56,350 --> 02:23:57,820
you know,
the son that he adores.

2470
02:23:58,120 --> 02:24:03,120
Once again,
you get that feeling of nicholas and 

2471
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:03,120
Alexandra has these kinds of parents who
just adore their children.

2472
02:24:03,340 --> 02:24:06,160
Whether or not this is some sort of 
smokescreen to cover something,

2473
02:24:06,340 --> 02:24:11,340
all the evidence seems to point out to a
guy who cared more about his family in 

2474
02:24:11,340 --> 02:24:12,400
some ways than beings are.

2475
02:24:14,130 --> 02:24:19,130
There was a quote to the guy who will 
take over the what's called the 

2476
02:24:19,130 --> 02:24:21,690
provisional government of,
um,

2477
02:24:22,450 --> 02:24:25,750
the country in the near future.
His name is Alexander Kerensky,

2478
02:24:26,320 --> 02:24:29,920
and he met the tsar after desire had 
been taken into custody.

2479
02:24:30,310 --> 02:24:31,240
And he said,
quote,

2480
02:24:31,750 --> 02:24:36,750
as I studied his face,
I seem to see behind his smile and 

2481
02:24:36,750 --> 02:24:37,240
charming eyes,
a stiff,

2482
02:24:37,360 --> 02:24:40,540
proper mask of utter loneliness and 
desolation.

2483
02:24:40,990 --> 02:24:45,990
When I began to know this living mask,
I understood why it had been so easy to 

2484
02:24:45,990 --> 02:24:48,130
overthrow his power.
He did not wish to fight for it,

2485
02:24:48,340 --> 02:24:53,340
and it simply fell from his hands and 
quote the things that this is our was 

2486
02:24:55,401 --> 02:25:00,401
going to have to do to keep power.
He seemed unwilling to do.

2487
02:25:00,520 --> 02:25:05,520
His wife may have wanted him to.
She wrote letters telling him he needed 

2488
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:09,121
to be tougher and stronger.
He seemed to care more about the fact 

2489
02:25:09,121 --> 02:25:10,140
that all his children,
while all this is going on,

2490
02:25:10,420 --> 02:25:15,420
have a bad case of the measles,
which was pretty serious back then and 

2491
02:25:15,420 --> 02:25:17,110
um,
is as concerned seemingly for them as he

2492
02:25:17,111 --> 02:25:18,570
is of giving up,
you know,

2493
02:25:18,720 --> 02:25:23,720
his power all over Russia,
they to break into government

2494
02:25:24,490 --> 02:25:28,570
buildings and tear down paintings of the
czar

2495
02:25:30,650 --> 02:25:34,880
and the aftermath of this revolution.
Sounds like the aftermath of the fall of

2496
02:25:34,881 --> 02:25:36,260
Saddam Hussein.
Again,

2497
02:25:36,261 --> 02:25:41,261
when all these figures that were part of
the government that worked for the czar 

2498
02:25:41,261 --> 02:25:43,340
are being arrested and held in custody 
by people,

2499
02:25:43,380 --> 02:25:48,380
you know,
armed with weapons to power blocks form 

2500
02:25:48,380 --> 02:25:49,190
in the wake of all this.
Because remember,

2501
02:25:49,191 --> 02:25:54,191
there is no plan.
The real revolutionaries who had been 

2502
02:25:54,191 --> 02:25:56,951
working for this for years.
We're kind of caught off guard when it 

2503
02:25:56,951 --> 02:25:56,951
happened.
So there's,

2504
02:25:56,951 --> 02:26:00,610
there's competing groups for power.
One group is the people that used to be 

2505
02:26:00,610 --> 02:26:04,151
the almost powerless Duma.
All of a sudden they have power and 

2506
02:26:04,151 --> 02:26:07,160
they're mostly liberals and um,
and mild socialist.

2507
02:26:07,161 --> 02:26:10,610
And people who want to create,
they end up writing the United States by

2508
02:26:10,611 --> 02:26:15,611
the way in June saying this,
they want to create a constitutional 

2509
02:26:15,611 --> 02:26:15,611
government.
They want to use maybe the United States

2510
02:26:15,611 --> 02:26:20,021
as a sort of a model,
but competing with that particular 

2511
02:26:20,021 --> 02:26:24,401
entity for power is power at a much 
lower level groups that especially of 

2512
02:26:24,401 --> 02:26:28,691
revolutionaries forming councils of 
workers and soldiers together and they 

2513
02:26:30,771 --> 02:26:35,771
formed this rough,
weird partnership with the provisional 

2514
02:26:35,771 --> 02:26:40,271
government is it's called the former 
Duma and they kind of work with each 

2515
02:26:40,271 --> 02:26:40,430
other sometimes,
but they come to,

2516
02:26:41,170 --> 02:26:42,860
you know,
disagreements over other things.

2517
02:26:43,310 --> 02:26:48,020
But when push comes to shove,
the Soviets as they're called these,

2518
02:26:48,660 --> 02:26:53,660
you know,
elected groups of people from soldiers 

2519
02:26:53,660 --> 02:26:56,691
and workers councils seems to win.
The first thing that they win is a rule 

2520
02:26:57,691 --> 02:27:02,691
that says that anything involving the 
military is under the control of the 

2521
02:27:02,691 --> 02:27:07,351
Soviets.
And this is the key issue for the other 

2522
02:27:07,850 --> 02:27:12,020
countries in the war in Germany wants 
Russia out of the war.

2523
02:27:12,670 --> 02:27:17,540
They have been paying agitators for a 
long time to hopefully make that happen.

2524
02:27:17,870 --> 02:27:20,270
Now you have this situation where the 
czars gone.

2525
02:27:20,271 --> 02:27:22,130
What are the Russians going to do 
militarily,

2526
02:27:22,340 --> 02:27:26,000
the British and the French field,
the same way along with the Americans.

2527
02:27:26,001 --> 02:27:28,100
They're not that upset that the czar is 
gone,

2528
02:27:28,310 --> 02:27:31,130
but they're very concerned that Russia 
is going to pull out of the war.

2529
02:27:32,860 --> 02:27:37,860
This provisional government,
there'll be known as the Koretsky 

2530
02:27:37,860 --> 02:27:37,860
government.
At a certain point,

2531
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:40,240
they tell the allies that they're going 
to continue fighting.

2532
02:27:40,241 --> 02:27:44,650
They're committed to continue fighting 
the allies start pouring money and stuff

2533
02:27:44,651 --> 02:27:47,380
into Russia even at a greater pace than 
they were before,

2534
02:27:48,070 --> 02:27:53,070
but how do you continue to hold off 
Germany in the central powers with your 

2535
02:27:53,070 --> 02:27:57,571
army while you're 300 year old monarchy 
is busy collapsing and all the 

2536
02:27:59,411 --> 02:28:04,360
structures that have been hanging by a 
string start falling apart.

2537
02:28:06,030 --> 02:28:07,860
What are the soldiers at the front going
to do?

2538
02:28:07,861 --> 02:28:11,430
This became the key question and it's 
not answered right away.

2539
02:28:12,770 --> 02:28:17,770
Churchill,
as only he can solve the whole thing is 

2540
02:28:17,770 --> 02:28:20,981
an unmitigated disaster.
Looking back on it from the late 19 

2541
02:28:20,981 --> 02:28:21,980
twenties again,
now he can where all this is

2542
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:26,030
going to go to communism in the future,
so his ideas are probably tainted.

2543
02:28:26,360 --> 02:28:28,550
He said,
the tragedy of Russia was,

2544
02:28:28,551 --> 02:28:33,551
and I'm quoting here,
that her ship went down within sight of 

2545
02:28:33,551 --> 02:28:33,551
port,
meaning you know,

2546
02:28:33,551 --> 02:28:38,161
we were just going to win this war,
and then Russia doesn't get to share in 

2547
02:28:38,161 --> 02:28:38,161
the spoils,
and he says,

2548
02:28:38,161 --> 02:28:40,820
I've Russia quote,
with victory in her grasp,

2549
02:28:40,970 --> 02:28:45,970
she fell upon the earth,
devoured alive like Herod of old by 

2550
02:28:45,970 --> 02:28:48,560
worms but not in vain.
Her valiant deeds,

2551
02:28:48,740 --> 02:28:53,240
the giant mortally stricken,
had just time with her dying strength to

2552
02:28:53,241 --> 02:28:58,241
pass the torch eastward across the ocean
to a new titan long sunken doubt,

2553
02:28:58,580 --> 02:29:01,580
who now arose and began ponderously to 
arm.

2554
02:29:01,850 --> 02:29:05,330
The Russian Empire fell on March 16th on
April sixth,

2555
02:29:05,480 --> 02:29:08,620
the United States entered the war and 
quote,

2556
02:29:10,460 --> 02:29:15,460
it's been an interesting two months for 
the United States since Germany decided 

2557
02:29:15,460 --> 02:29:19,481
to unleash the submarines in the first 
20 days of unleashing the submarines.

2558
02:29:19,730 --> 02:29:23,360
The Germans sink a hundred and 28 
merchant ships,

2559
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:26,520
40 neutrals among them.
Um,

2560
02:29:26,540 --> 02:29:31,540
there are US shipping companies in the 
month of February when this all starts 

2561
02:29:31,540 --> 02:29:34,280
that start losing a million dollars.
Nineteen 17 value money by the way,

2562
02:29:34,760 --> 02:29:37,400
a week.
The next month,

2563
02:29:37,401 --> 02:29:38,530
March 19,
17,

2564
02:29:38,540 --> 02:29:43,540
those numbers will double and all of a 
sudden we begin to see what the first 

2565
02:29:44,090 --> 02:29:49,090
real competent use involving at least a 
minimum number of submarines is like in 

2566
02:29:51,291 --> 02:29:54,350
world history.
The Germans had been perfecting what you

2567
02:29:54,351 --> 02:29:57,410
do with these new weapons systems like 
submarines,

2568
02:29:57,411 --> 02:29:59,220
these science fiction type weapons.
What do you.

2569
02:29:59,230 --> 02:30:00,800
How do you use them at the beginning of 
the war?

2570
02:30:00,801 --> 02:30:03,140
They're kind of going after war ships 
and whatnot,

2571
02:30:03,141 --> 02:30:08,141
and then they work on short little burst
going after neutrals and merchant ships 

2572
02:30:08,141 --> 02:30:12,461
and now by 1917 the Germans know what 
they want to do with these things and 

2573
02:30:12,461 --> 02:30:14,150
they have enough ships to make their 
plan work.

2574
02:30:14,180 --> 02:30:19,180
Minimum number,
but enough they unleashed them to go 

2575
02:30:19,180 --> 02:30:21,851
after everything,
which is what their strategy has told 

2576
02:30:21,851 --> 02:30:24,191
them.
You have to do to really maximize this 

2577
02:30:24,191 --> 02:30:26,021
weapon system and they're sinking enough
ships so that Britain is for the first 

2578
02:30:28,431 --> 02:30:32,120
time in the war in real danger itself of
going under.

2579
02:30:32,690 --> 02:30:36,950
One of the advantages of being an island
nation is if you got the strongest navy,

2580
02:30:37,100 --> 02:30:42,100
you don't have to have the same kind of 
fears that are Russia has or a France 

2581
02:30:42,100 --> 02:30:46,301
has.
The Germans aren't going to be able to 

2582
02:30:46,301 --> 02:30:46,301
break you directly because they can't 
reach you.

2583
02:30:46,301 --> 02:30:48,530
This is the first time in the war that 
the British face,

2584
02:30:48,531 --> 02:30:51,980
any serious threat of the Germans in one
way or another,

2585
02:30:51,981 --> 02:30:54,290
reaching them,
affecting them personally,

2586
02:30:54,500 --> 02:30:59,420
forcing them perhaps to knuckle under to
some sort of peace deal.

2587
02:31:00,470 --> 02:31:04,250
In April the month the United States 
gets into the war,

2588
02:31:04,910 --> 02:31:09,910
the Germans sync for 123 merchant men,
almost 850,000

2589
02:31:11,061 --> 02:31:12,020
tons of shipping.

2590
02:31:13,430 --> 02:31:17,450
The British empire cannot stand those 
kinds of losses.

2591
02:31:18,740 --> 02:31:22,500
It's submarine war that eventually 
brings the United States in.

2592
02:31:22,800 --> 02:31:27,800
If for no other reason than it's 
disrupting operations in the country.

2593
02:31:28,950 --> 02:31:32,100
The president is under a lot of pressure
on a day to day increasing basis because

2594
02:31:32,101 --> 02:31:33,930
once Germany started sinking,
all these ships,

2595
02:31:34,110 --> 02:31:39,110
US ships stopped leaving.
They begin to congregate and clogged up 

2596
02:31:39,151 --> 02:31:42,960
and cause traffic jams outside the major
ports on the eastern seaboard.

2597
02:31:43,230 --> 02:31:48,230
And then all of the commodities and food
and perishables that were going to be 

2598
02:31:48,230 --> 02:31:49,080
loaded onto those ships begin backing 
up.

2599
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:54,500
You got this terrible catalog at all the
ports on the eastern coast of material 

2600
02:31:54,661 --> 02:31:59,661
that's rotting and degrading because the
ship's won't cross the Atlantic because 

2601
02:31:59,661 --> 02:32:02,520
they're afraid of the submarines.
At one point,

2602
02:32:02,580 --> 02:32:05,430
Wilson wants to arm these ships to 
change the situation.

2603
02:32:06,780 --> 02:32:08,520
He wants to provide insurance so that 
they can,

2604
02:32:08,760 --> 02:32:09,420
you know,
cross.

2605
02:32:09,960 --> 02:32:12,270
But this is like a ticking time bomb for
Wilson.

2606
02:32:12,271 --> 02:32:15,690
He's got to do something.
This situation only going to get worse.

2607
02:32:17,010 --> 02:32:19,380
The Zimmerman telegram happens in late 
February to.

2608
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:24,500
I mean all these things that just 
increases situation that's bad and make 

2609
02:32:24,500 --> 02:32:28,761
it worse.
But there's no instant moment where the 

2610
02:32:28,761 --> 02:32:30,480
line has been crossed and there never 
will be

2611
02:32:33,480 --> 02:32:36,990
at some point by March 19,
17 at the latest.

2612
02:32:36,991 --> 02:32:39,780
And probably around the same time the 
Russian revolution is happening,

2613
02:32:40,050 --> 02:32:45,050
the Wilson Administration decides that 
they've had enough five US ships go down

2614
02:32:45,991 --> 02:32:49,290
in March 19,
17 to some in the Wilson Administration.

2615
02:32:49,291 --> 02:32:52,980
This is confirmation that the US has 
already at war with Germany.

2616
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:58,280
There doesn't have to be some big 
Lusitania nine slash 11 moment to 

2617
02:32:58,280 --> 02:33:02,570
crossover this invisible line.
It's happening every day and on April 

2618
02:33:02,570 --> 02:33:04,080
Second Wilson gives his most famous 
speech,

2619
02:33:04,081 --> 02:33:09,081
one of the most important speeches in 
American history concerning the 

2620
02:33:09,081 --> 02:33:13,341
situation that he sees that the United 
States is at war with Germany.

2621
02:33:14,070 --> 02:33:15,780
And the interesting part about the 
speech,

2622
02:33:15,781 --> 02:33:18,600
if you dissected,
it's monumental on so many levels.

2623
02:33:19,230 --> 02:33:21,060
He's so crafty the way it's put 
together.

2624
02:33:21,090 --> 02:33:23,940
He never says to the Congress,
declare war on Germany,

2625
02:33:24,180 --> 02:33:25,770
you know,
so that will be at war with Germany.

2626
02:33:25,771 --> 02:33:30,771
He says,
we're at war with Germany and I invite 

2627
02:33:30,771 --> 02:33:31,380
you to confirm that fact he had no time.

2628
02:33:31,380 --> 02:33:36,380
Gives Congress the impression that they 
have any control over this decision at 

2629
02:33:36,380 --> 02:33:36,380
all.
Now,

2630
02:33:36,380 --> 02:33:38,610
luckily for him,
they went along with him big time,

2631
02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:43,880
but what if they hadn't?
Part of Wilson's speech focuses on the 

2632
02:33:43,880 --> 02:33:45,060
specific reason.
We're at this point.

2633
02:33:45,061 --> 02:33:50,061
He talks about the submarine warfare,
compares Germans to pirates and all 

2634
02:33:50,061 --> 02:33:53,781
these kinds of things.
Then he takes some time out of his 

2635
02:33:53,781 --> 02:33:54,780
speech to say that we're not at war with
the German people.

2636
02:33:54,781 --> 02:33:59,781
We have no quarrel with them,
it's their government we don't like and 

2637
02:33:59,781 --> 02:34:03,291
this is a big change by the way,
in the way that much of the United 

2638
02:34:04,140 --> 02:34:06,310
States government will craft,
you know,

2639
02:34:06,330 --> 02:34:09,290
the way that they frame relationships 
with other countries too.

2640
02:34:09,320 --> 02:34:14,320
I got nothing against the people.
It's the government and Wilson's point 

2641
02:34:14,320 --> 02:34:17,631
of view is if the people aren't running 
the government like in a democracy or a 

2642
02:34:17,631 --> 02:34:20,901
republic,
well then the people aren't responsible 

2643
02:34:20,901 --> 02:34:20,901
for what their government's decisions 
are.

2644
02:34:20,901 --> 02:34:24,991
They may be the victims of it and we 
might have to hurt you in order to 

2645
02:34:24,991 --> 02:34:28,321
overthrow your government,
but we're not mad at you about half this

2646
02:34:29,451 --> 02:34:34,451
speech is really high minded sentiments 
forever known afterwards as Wilsonian 

2647
02:34:34,791 --> 02:34:39,791
principles that talk about things like 
the need to make the world safe for 

2648
02:34:39,831 --> 02:34:44,831
democracy.
And I'll give you a taste of that in a 

2649
02:34:44,831 --> 02:34:44,831
second but more interesting.
And again,

2650
02:34:44,831 --> 02:34:48,851
one of the more groundbreaking parts of 
this speech is that Wilson takes on the 

2651
02:34:48,851 --> 02:34:52,301
US tradition of non involvement in 
European affairs head on.

2652
02:34:53,790 --> 02:34:57,120
And he basically said that was the way 
it was.

2653
02:34:57,330 --> 02:35:01,140
Times have changed.
Here's the exact phrasing that he gives,

2654
02:35:01,350 --> 02:35:06,350
but it is a sea change in American 
foreign policy and the way the 

2655
02:35:06,350 --> 02:35:09,060
government of the United States 
approaches the conflicts and involvement

2656
02:35:09,061 --> 02:35:12,690
with the rest of the world and that 
course change is one we are still living

2657
02:35:12,691 --> 02:35:17,691
with today in the modern world in the 
middle of his speech telling Congress 

2658
02:35:17,731 --> 02:35:20,910
that award exists right now in Germany.
Wilson says,

2659
02:35:20,911 --> 02:35:21,330
quote,

2660
02:35:23,320 --> 02:35:28,320
our object now as then is to vindicate 
the principles of Peace and justice in 

2661
02:35:28,320 --> 02:35:33,301
the life of the world as against selfish
and autocratic power and to set up 

2662
02:35:33,301 --> 02:35:36,220
amongst the really free and 
self-governed peoples of the world,

2663
02:35:36,400 --> 02:35:39,070
such a concert of purpose into action as
well,

2664
02:35:39,071 --> 02:35:44,071
hence forth.
Ensure the observance of those 

2665
02:35:44,071 --> 02:35:46,261
principles.
Neutrality is no longer feasible or 

2666
02:35:46,261 --> 02:35:48,070
desirable,
where the peace of the world is involved

2667
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:52,300
and the freedom of its peoples and the 
menace to that peace and freedom lies in

2668
02:35:52,301 --> 02:35:57,301
the existence of autocratic governments 
backed by organized force which has 

2669
02:35:57,301 --> 02:36:00,100
controlled holy by there will not by the
will of their people.

2670
02:36:00,390 --> 02:36:05,200
We have seen the last of neutrality in 
such circumstances were at the beginning

2671
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:10,200
of an age where it will be insisted that
the same standards of conduct and have 

2672
02:36:10,200 --> 02:36:13,561
responsibility for wrong done shall be 
observed among nations and their 

2673
02:36:13,561 --> 02:36:17,550
governments that are observed among the 
individual citizens of civilized states 

2674
02:36:17,550 --> 02:36:22,320
and quote,
having a national policy connected to 

2675
02:36:22,341 --> 02:36:27,341
the idea of not going abroad in search 
of monsters to slay just started to 

2676
02:36:27,341 --> 02:36:28,940
sound really old fashioned,
didn't it?

2677
02:36:30,470 --> 02:36:35,470
But at least Wilson's got some really 
good arguments to justify the historic 

2678
02:36:37,070 --> 02:36:42,070
course change.
These are the ideas of wilsonianism and 

2679
02:36:42,070 --> 02:36:45,620
here's how Wilson annunciates just some 
of them quote,

2680
02:36:46,160 --> 02:36:49,460
it is a distressing and oppressive duty.
Gentlemen of the Congress,

2681
02:36:49,610 --> 02:36:51,860
which I have performed in thus 
addressing you.

2682
02:36:52,070 --> 02:36:55,670
There are,
it may be many months of fiery trial and

2683
02:36:55,671 --> 02:37:00,671
sacrifice ahead of us.
It is a fearful thing to lead this 

2684
02:37:00,671 --> 02:37:03,911
great,
peaceful people into war into the most 

2685
02:37:03,911 --> 02:37:06,050
terrible disasters of all wars.
Civilization itself seeming to be in the

2686
02:37:06,051 --> 02:37:11,051
balance,
but the right is more precious than 

2687
02:37:11,051 --> 02:37:12,830
piece and we shall fight for the things 
which we have always carried nearest our

2688
02:37:12,831 --> 02:37:15,090
hearts for democracy,
for the right,

2689
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:20,200
those who submit to authority to have a 
voice in their own governments for the 

2690
02:37:20,200 --> 02:37:23,741
rights and liberties of small nations 
for a universal dominion of right by 

2691
02:37:23,741 --> 02:37:28,391
such a concert of free peoples as shall 
bring peace and safety to all nations 

2692
02:37:28,391 --> 02:37:33,040
and make the world itself at last free 
to such a task we can dedicate our lives

2693
02:37:33,591 --> 02:37:36,110
and our fortunes,
everything that we are in,

2694
02:37:36,111 --> 02:37:41,111
everything that we have with the pride 
of those who know that the day has come 

2695
02:37:41,111 --> 02:37:44,330
when America is privileged to spend her 
blood and her might,

2696
02:37:44,540 --> 02:37:49,540
for the principles that gave her birth 
and happiness and the peace which she 

2697
02:37:49,540 --> 02:37:50,150
has treasured God helping her.

2698
02:37:50,150 --> 02:37:55,150
She can do no other and quote one 
wonders what John Quincy Adams would 

2699
02:37:56,901 --> 02:38:01,700
reply to that nonetheless.
Guys like Theodore Roosevelt,

2700
02:38:01,701 --> 02:38:06,701
who had been saying he was going to skin
Wilson alive if Wilson didn't go to war 

2701
02:38:07,010 --> 02:38:08,090
like the speech a lot.

2702
02:38:10,340 --> 02:38:15,340
It's interesting to note by the way,
that the one American political figure 

2703
02:38:15,340 --> 02:38:20,291
that the Europeans really respect in 
this whole question is Theodore 

2704
02:38:20,291 --> 02:38:21,890
Roosevelt,
because Theodore Roosevelt is really one

2705
02:38:21,891 --> 02:38:24,500
of the early what will be called Atlanta
cysts.

2706
02:38:24,650 --> 02:38:26,000
People who believe,
for example,

2707
02:38:26,120 --> 02:38:31,120
in locking arms with countries like 
Great Britain and doing great things 

2708
02:38:31,120 --> 02:38:34,421
with them.
Tiara was an interventionist before his 

2709
02:38:34,421 --> 02:38:37,580
time and in the United States.
He's thought of as an extremist.

2710
02:38:37,581 --> 02:38:42,581
The Republican candidate for president 
tells him to stop campaigning for him 

2711
02:38:42,581 --> 02:38:46,810
because he's so bellicose.
It's working against the Republican 

2712
02:38:46,810 --> 02:38:46,810
Party,
right?

2713
02:38:46,810 --> 02:38:48,890
You're letting Wilson and the opposition
portray us as warmongers.

2714
02:38:49,400 --> 02:38:54,400
That's the guy though that appeared to 
be ahead of the curve when it came to 

2715
02:38:54,400 --> 02:38:56,900
figuring out that Germany needed to be 
dealt with.

2716
02:38:57,050 --> 02:38:58,730
Again,
from the British point of view,

2717
02:38:58,970 --> 02:39:03,970
there's a lot of this that you could 
look at and say the various things the 

2718
02:39:03,970 --> 02:39:06,431
Germans are being slammed for doing are 
things that they were kind of forced 

2719
02:39:06,431 --> 02:39:09,020
into doing by what their opponents were 
up to.

2720
02:39:09,860 --> 02:39:12,080
The first world war is not the clear 
cut,

2721
02:39:12,081 --> 02:39:15,950
good and evil separation that the Second
World War is,

2722
02:39:16,330 --> 02:39:18,800
and we've mentioned that before.
Nonetheless,

2723
02:39:18,830 --> 02:39:23,830
if you're on one side of it,
it certainly is the prime minister of 

2724
02:39:23,830 --> 02:39:27,581
Great Britain for about a couple of 
months when Wilson makes his historic 

2725
02:39:27,581 --> 02:39:30,530
speech,
is Lloyd George in his memoirs,

2726
02:39:30,710 --> 02:39:35,710
Lloyd George Writing after the war can't
help but take a shot at Wilson,

2727
02:39:36,770 --> 02:39:41,770
not because of what he did,
but because of how long it took him 

2728
02:39:41,770 --> 02:39:42,800
speaking about Wilson's speech.
Now,

2729
02:39:43,190 --> 02:39:44,240
George writes,
quote,

2730
02:39:45,350 --> 02:39:48,710
these principles were excellent and 
excellently expressed.

2731
02:39:48,920 --> 02:39:53,920
The ally.
Democracies are France and the British 

2732
02:39:53,920 --> 02:39:56,081
Commonwealth had already borne the 
burden and been scorched by the heat of 

2733
02:39:56,081 --> 02:39:59,330
a thousand days in the battle with this 
natural flow to liberty,

2734
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:03,650
stealing one of Wilson's lines from his 
speech they rejoiced.

2735
02:40:03,710 --> 02:40:08,710
George does at the advent of this 
powerful help from the greatest 

2736
02:40:08,710 --> 02:40:10,550
democracy in the world at a time when 
troubles were multiplying,

2737
02:40:10,820 --> 02:40:12,980
they perhaps might be excused for 
thinking.

2738
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:18,200
That issue is so clear now to President 
Wilson ought to have been apparent 

2739
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:21,830
earlier to his eyes.
They felt grateful in their hearts to 

2740
02:40:21,830 --> 02:40:24,891
the great American Theodore Roosevelt,
whose vision was so undimmed and who 

2741
02:40:24,891 --> 02:40:29,731
sympathies were so sure from the outset 
of this grim struggle for international 

2742
02:40:29,731 --> 02:40:33,411
right and quote Winston Churchill 
sounded almost the exact same way.

2743
02:40:34,381 --> 02:40:38,100
What took you so long?
Speaking of Wilson's piece,

2744
02:40:38,130 --> 02:40:43,130
attitudes quote he had behind his policy
or reason to explanation and massive 

2745
02:40:44,071 --> 02:40:49,071
argument and all must respect the 
motives of a statesman who seeks to 

2746
02:40:49,071 --> 02:40:50,760
spare his country the waste and horrors 
of war,

2747
02:40:51,060 --> 02:40:52,710
but nothing.
Churchill writes,

2748
02:40:52,920 --> 02:40:55,470
can reconcile what he said after March 
19,

2749
02:40:55,471 --> 02:40:59,550
17 with a guidance he had given before.
What he did in April,

2750
02:40:59,551 --> 02:41:00,630
19,
17.

2751
02:41:00,631 --> 02:41:02,850
Could have been done in May 19,
15.

2752
02:41:03,030 --> 02:41:06,000
And if done then what abridgment of the 
slaughter,

2753
02:41:06,060 --> 02:41:08,520
what sparing of the agony,
what ruined,

2754
02:41:08,521 --> 02:41:12,540
what catastrophes would've been 
prevented in how many million homes with

2755
02:41:12,541 --> 02:41:17,541
an empty chair be occupied today?
How different would be the shattered 

2756
02:41:17,541 --> 02:41:20,780
world in which victor and vanquished 
alike are condemned to live and quote,

2757
02:41:21,570 --> 02:41:26,570
writing from the late 19 twenties and 
seeing the mortally wounded and terribly

2758
02:41:27,301 --> 02:41:32,301
scarred continent,
which Winston Churchill remembers as 

2759
02:41:32,301 --> 02:41:35,100
being the height of world civilization 
to him.

2760
02:41:35,101 --> 02:41:40,101
The US taking this long to get into the 
war looks like something that costs you 

2761
02:41:40,171 --> 02:41:41,550
the world you knew

2762
02:41:45,280 --> 02:41:48,610
a couple of days after the president 
gives his famous speech,

2763
02:41:48,970 --> 02:41:52,390
the Congress votes to support him and 
take the nation to war.

2764
02:41:52,960 --> 02:41:55,420
The vote wasn't close by the way,
in the House of Representatives,

2765
02:41:55,421 --> 02:42:00,421
it was something like 374 or 375 to 50 
and as much as a wipe out as that 

2766
02:42:01,601 --> 02:42:06,601
sounds,
I read somewhere that that's the second 

2767
02:42:06,601 --> 02:42:09,151
most opposition.
The congress has ever shown the 

2768
02:42:09,151 --> 02:42:09,151
president in a war vote.
The war of 18,

2769
02:42:09,151 --> 02:42:13,771
12 being the most nonetheless seems 
pretty clear that most of those people 

2770
02:42:15,161 --> 02:42:20,161
voting or unsure about what voting for 
going to war was going to mean the 

2771
02:42:20,321 --> 02:42:25,321
future mayor of New York fiero Laguardia
was a congressmen when this vote was 

2772
02:42:25,321 --> 02:42:27,430
taken.
He said that 60 percent,

2773
02:42:27,431 --> 02:42:29,880
he said 30 years after the war,
that 60 percent of his brethren,

2774
02:42:29,890 --> 02:42:32,980
we're pretty sure this wasn't going to 
mean troops on the ground in Europe.

2775
02:42:33,400 --> 02:42:36,250
The US didn't send armies overseas to 
fight,

2776
02:42:36,350 --> 02:42:37,570
you know,
on European soil.

2777
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:40,930
They thought it was going to be like 
financial aid and naval help.

2778
02:42:43,110 --> 02:42:45,870
Naval helped is the one thing that us 
can do right away.

2779
02:42:46,050 --> 02:42:51,050
Military Health and an army.
That's a problem because the US really 

2780
02:42:51,050 --> 02:42:51,050
doesn't have one.

2781
02:42:52,110 --> 02:42:52,860
In April,
19,

2782
02:42:52,861 --> 02:42:56,430
17,
the US army's ranked 17th largest in the

2783
02:42:56,431 --> 02:43:01,431
world.
Doesn't have any flame throwers or any 

2784
02:43:01,431 --> 02:43:05,730
tanks or any gas masks or mortars,
no grenades.

2785
02:43:06,330 --> 02:43:11,330
The aircraft are these rickety strange 
beasts that you the right bread,

2786
02:43:13,060 --> 02:43:18,060
they look like the planes,
the Wright brothers kind of put 

2787
02:43:18,060 --> 02:43:18,060
together.
They don't look modern at all.

2788
02:43:19,150 --> 02:43:24,150
There's not enough artillery shells for 
the guns to shoot more than a few 

2789
02:43:24,150 --> 02:43:25,170
minutes by western front,
you know,

2790
02:43:25,171 --> 02:43:25,930
standards.

2791
02:43:27,380 --> 02:43:32,380
Historian,
justice donut key says that the US 

2792
02:43:32,380 --> 02:43:35,780
relatively speaking had been better 
prepared for the American revolution and

2793
02:43:35,781 --> 02:43:39,770
the war of 1812 than they were prepared 
for the first world war.

2794
02:43:40,670 --> 02:43:44,090
I disagree with him about that,
but his point is well taken.

2795
02:43:44,510 --> 02:43:46,970
The United States,
if it's going to be any help to Europe,

2796
02:43:47,190 --> 02:43:52,190
Europe's going to have to survive while 
it waits for this help to be 

2797
02:43:52,190 --> 02:43:55,481
accumulated.
The only place that us can help right 

2798
02:43:55,481 --> 02:43:55,790
away is with money,
which they were kind of doing already.

2799
02:43:55,791 --> 02:43:57,980
They're going to lower interest rates 
and give better deals,

2800
02:43:57,981 --> 02:44:02,981
but it's a continuation of what was 
already happening and the use of the 

2801
02:44:02,981 --> 02:44:06,521
navy and the thing the navy can do right
away is held against the submarines 

2802
02:44:06,521 --> 02:44:09,080
because as we said in April 19,
17,

2803
02:44:09,260 --> 02:44:12,740
the submarine sink more than 400 
merchant ships.

2804
02:44:13,940 --> 02:44:16,700
Britain's problem isn't that it doesn't 
have to stop all the sinking.

2805
02:44:16,700 --> 02:44:21,700
It has to stop the rate,
which is so much more than what it can 

2806
02:44:21,700 --> 02:44:22,280
rebuild.
If it loses less ships than it can build

2807
02:44:22,281 --> 02:44:23,210
a month,
it's doing well.

2808
02:44:23,211 --> 02:44:25,160
If it loses more shifts than it can 
build a month,

2809
02:44:25,161 --> 02:44:28,730
it's in trouble.
The height of this submarine war will be

2810
02:44:28,731 --> 02:44:31,970
from February 19,
17 when unrestricted warfare is declared

2811
02:44:32,120 --> 02:44:36,020
and the next eight months.
This is when Britain lives or dies.

2812
02:44:36,021 --> 02:44:41,021
Those are the stakes and Lloyd George 
and Churchill and all these guys go out 

2813
02:44:41,021 --> 02:44:44,771
of their way to talk about the almost 
alarm is the word Lloyd George's is 

2814
02:44:44,771 --> 02:44:48,910
Lloyd.
George says that there are some of the 

2815
02:44:48,910 --> 02:44:50,861
most cautious people in his cabinet that
are starting to muse out loud about 

2816
02:44:50,861 --> 02:44:52,100
maybe we better make peace while we 
still have some ships afloat,

2817
02:44:54,110 --> 02:44:59,110
and he says the Germans were getting 
gleeful that at times they just had 

2818
02:44:59,110 --> 02:45:02,651
these reports coming in that made all 
the pro sub marine people seem to be 

2819
02:45:02,651 --> 02:45:07,301
perfectly correct.
They were all of a sudden going to win 

2820
02:45:07,301 --> 02:45:07,301
the war.
Churchill said,

2821
02:45:07,301 --> 02:45:07,340
we went from being,
you know,

2822
02:45:07,341 --> 02:45:10,700
the side that had time on our side and 
we could just wait this out and everyday

2823
02:45:10,760 --> 02:45:15,760
the Germans were losing the war a little
bit more to having the tables flipped 

2824
02:45:15,760 --> 02:45:19,031
and now time was on the German side and 
the British had to come up with 

2825
02:45:19,031 --> 02:45:22,031
countermeasures or lose the war fast.
They not only did this,

2826
02:45:22,550 --> 02:45:26,000
but it was the civilian leadership that 
pushed for the answer that turned out to

2827
02:45:26,001 --> 02:45:31,001
make the biggest difference.
This is sort of one of these early 

2828
02:45:31,001 --> 02:45:31,610
indications that something is changing 
in the war.

2829
02:45:32,150 --> 02:45:37,150
For years,
the military men have had an almost 

2830
02:45:37,150 --> 02:45:39,670
unquestioned authority to choose 
whatever path for fighting the war they 

2831
02:45:39,670 --> 02:45:40,700
wanted to,
no matter what happened,

2832
02:45:41,090 --> 02:45:46,090
but now so many people had died and so 
many disasters and so much of the same 

2833
02:45:46,090 --> 02:45:49,991
tactic seeming to equal the same results
except more bodies stacking higher and 

2834
02:45:49,991 --> 02:45:52,340
higher that that there was pushback now 
from civilian leaders.

2835
02:45:52,550 --> 02:45:57,550
Lloyd George and Britain is one of these
guys who's who says openly that my job 

2836
02:45:57,550 --> 02:45:59,690
is to protect the soldier in the field 
and to the soldier in the field,

2837
02:45:59,691 --> 02:46:01,580
the generals,
his biggest enemy sometimes,

2838
02:46:01,790 --> 02:46:04,790
and you could hear all this,
talk about the stupidity of the military

2839
02:46:04,791 --> 02:46:09,791
leaders.
Even Churchill kind of goes out of his 

2840
02:46:09,791 --> 02:46:11,891
way to say that the military experts all
against the solution that ended up 

2841
02:46:11,891 --> 02:46:14,240
solving the sub problem.
It was the civilian leaders for the most

2842
02:46:14,241 --> 02:46:17,090
part,
that pushed the idea that won the day.

2843
02:46:17,330 --> 02:46:21,770
The idea was both breathtakingly simple 
and incredibly complex.

2844
02:46:22,250 --> 02:46:27,250
The idea was convoys,
the grouping of ships into large 

2845
02:46:28,690 --> 02:46:33,690
formations surrounding them with war 
ships and escorts and sending these 

2846
02:46:33,690 --> 02:46:38,110
large bodies of ships across at 
organized times and schedules.

2847
02:46:39,370 --> 02:46:44,370
The military men often believed that 
this was just going to group your 

2848
02:46:44,370 --> 02:46:47,341
targets for the submarines,
make it even easier to align ships up 

2849
02:46:47,341 --> 02:46:50,050
like in a shooting gallery,
but when it was experimented on again,

2850
02:46:50,051 --> 02:46:52,870
the civilian leaders pushing to 
experiment with this.

2851
02:46:53,170 --> 02:46:55,930
The results were fantastic almost right 
away.

2852
02:46:57,800 --> 02:46:58,910
The u boats,
that approach,

2853
02:46:58,911 --> 02:47:00,950
these kinds of formations often got 
sunk.

2854
02:47:01,370 --> 02:47:06,370
The idea that it was going to be easier 
to spot 50 or 60 ships on the water 

2855
02:47:06,370 --> 02:47:10,511
rather than a single ship turned out to 
not be true in the vast spaces of the 

2856
02:47:10,511 --> 02:47:14,201
ocean.
Big Ole convoys got swallowed up to and 

2857
02:47:14,201 --> 02:47:17,411
as Churchill said,
when these convoys made it across the 

2858
02:47:17,411 --> 02:47:20,321
water and slipped through the blockade,
instead of having one ship make it 

2859
02:47:20,321 --> 02:47:20,321
through the German blockade,
you had 40,

2860
02:47:20,321 --> 02:47:21,170
50 or 60 ships do it

2861
02:47:23,210 --> 02:47:28,210
by October 19,
17 of 99 convoys heading to Great 

2862
02:47:28,210 --> 02:47:30,950
Britain with more than 1500 ships in 
them.

2863
02:47:31,340 --> 02:47:34,460
Only 10 that were still part of the 
convoy,

2864
02:47:34,461 --> 02:47:38,690
we're sunk 14 more that it straight and 
got lost.

2865
02:47:38,691 --> 02:47:43,160
We're sunk.
Those are easily replaceable losses.

2866
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:48,760
And by October 1917,
it was clear that the Germans were no 

2867
02:47:48,760 --> 02:47:52,661
longer going to be able to sink more 
shipping than the British could replace 

2868
02:47:52,661 --> 02:47:57,520
what's more.
They now had us ship yards helping to 

2869
02:47:57,520 --> 02:47:59,640
replace them.
As you might imagine,

2870
02:47:59,641 --> 02:48:04,590
the whole decision on Germany's part to 
engage in this kind of submarine warfare

2871
02:48:04,591 --> 02:48:08,850
is one of the most,
if not the most criticized decision that

2872
02:48:08,851 --> 02:48:13,410
the German leadership ever made.
It's understandable and you know,

2873
02:48:13,411 --> 02:48:18,411
it kind of once again puts the lie to 
this stereotype of the Germans as sort 

2874
02:48:18,411 --> 02:48:20,300
of applauding methodical,
sort of,

2875
02:48:20,560 --> 02:48:21,590
um,
you know,

2876
02:48:21,700 --> 02:48:25,490
conservative sort of leadership style 
because in both were awards,

2877
02:48:25,491 --> 02:48:28,550
the Germans would prove to be great,
great gamblers.

2878
02:48:29,030 --> 02:48:32,950
They just weren't lucky gamblers,
but they were willing many times to sort

2879
02:48:32,951 --> 02:48:34,970
of throw caution to the wind and try 
these things.

2880
02:48:35,180 --> 02:48:40,180
In a sense though,
it's a defense mechanism when you are 

2881
02:48:40,180 --> 02:48:40,180
the weaker party

2882
02:48:40,440 --> 02:48:45,440
mean to me,
the analogy that works best in the in 

2883
02:48:45,440 --> 02:48:48,111
the war that,
that we have going right now is to 

2884
02:48:48,111 --> 02:48:50,991
weight lifters competing against each 
other and one of these weightlifters is 

2885
02:48:50,991 --> 02:48:54,921
bigger and stronger than the other one,
which is obviously a huge advantage in 

2886
02:48:54,921 --> 02:48:55,350
weightlifting,
but it isn't.

2887
02:48:55,351 --> 02:48:59,250
Everything on the weaker weightlifter 
has to try,

2888
02:48:59,660 --> 02:49:04,660
you know,
to make up for it with technique and 

2889
02:49:04,660 --> 02:49:04,660
training and will to win

2890
02:49:05,450 --> 02:49:10,450
and maybe taking some chances.
That's Germany strategy for the rest of 

2891
02:49:10,450 --> 02:49:10,970
this war.
And you know,

2892
02:49:10,971 --> 02:49:15,971
you're seeing so many aspects of change 
from the 19th century to the 20th 

2893
02:49:16,321 --> 02:49:18,120
century that you can point to in the 
story.

2894
02:49:18,121 --> 02:49:20,460
Because that's really the theme when you
look at this war.

2895
02:49:20,760 --> 02:49:22,110
You know,
in a big picture sense.

2896
02:49:22,710 --> 02:49:26,940
Germany has transformed in the recent 
past 1916 the year before this time.

2897
02:49:26,941 --> 02:49:31,170
We're in now from really an old style 
monarchy with legislative,

2898
02:49:31,220 --> 02:49:32,350
you know,
balancing out to,

2899
02:49:32,430 --> 02:49:36,210
to something that looks much more like a
20th century military dictatorship.

2900
02:49:36,720 --> 02:49:41,720
And it doesn't happen overnight and it 
almost kind of happens because it needs 

2901
02:49:41,720 --> 02:49:44,931
to.
The only way Germany has a chance in 

2902
02:49:44,931 --> 02:49:46,980
this war is to be the technique master 
and have the greater will to win.

2903
02:49:46,981 --> 02:49:48,750
All those things I said about the 
smaller weightlifter.

2904
02:49:49,020 --> 02:49:54,020
Germany has to organize it society more 
efficiently than the more powerful 

2905
02:49:54,020 --> 02:49:54,540
allied countries.

2906
02:49:54,540 --> 02:49:59,540
If it's going to stand a chance.
And one of the things that happens is 

2907
02:49:59,540 --> 02:49:59,540
when you get Hindenburg and Ludendorff 
in there,

2908
02:49:59,540 --> 02:50:02,940
remember the two German commanders,
we talked about this military team,

2909
02:50:02,941 --> 02:50:05,370
but it's really only one guy,
the Luton Dorf guy.

2910
02:50:05,820 --> 02:50:09,540
He takes on more and more the powers 
that in the 20th century we see over and

2911
02:50:09,541 --> 02:50:14,541
over again in regimes where you have one
strong man who sort of has dictatorial 

2912
02:50:14,541 --> 02:50:19,071
control and the Germans start to try to 
organize their society to make it more 

2913
02:50:19,071 --> 02:50:19,071
efficient.
Like,

2914
02:50:19,071 --> 02:50:20,640
you know,
being able to tell workers where they're

2915
02:50:20,641 --> 02:50:21,870
going to work,
you know,

2916
02:50:21,871 --> 02:50:26,871
controlling people down to that level.
Because as one of the German leaders 

2917
02:50:26,871 --> 02:50:31,031
said,
the goal is to turn Germany into one 

2918
02:50:31,031 --> 02:50:33,771
vast munitions factory.
To do that requires a sort of single 

2919
02:50:33,771 --> 02:50:37,200
mindedness and and a lot of power 
concentrated in one person at this stage

2920
02:50:37,201 --> 02:50:37,560
in the war.

2921
02:50:37,560 --> 02:50:42,560
That person is Ludina doors.
He and Hindenburg took over in 1916 and 

2922
02:50:42,560 --> 02:50:46,491
the first thing they did was sort of do 
an audit of how the war is going and 

2923
02:50:46,491 --> 02:50:47,280
what we're doing to fight it in the 
conditions.

2924
02:50:47,670 --> 02:50:52,670
And the first condition you noticed when
you take over the entire war is on the 

2925
02:50:52,670 --> 02:50:56,421
western front.
You have about two and a half million 

2926
02:50:56,421 --> 02:50:59,871
men manning the barricades.
The other side has about 4 million men 

2927
02:50:59,871 --> 02:51:01,650
and their numbers are increasing every 
month.

2928
02:51:01,651 --> 02:51:06,030
How do those trends look?
You have food riots at home.

2929
02:51:06,031 --> 02:51:11,031
Women fighting with police officers in 
the streets because they can't get the 

2930
02:51:11,031 --> 02:51:14,100
food they need.
You have strikes in a bunch of the major

2931
02:51:14,101 --> 02:51:19,101
firms and in a bunch of the cities and 
they get so bad sometimes the army has 

2932
02:51:19,101 --> 02:51:19,980
to be called in to disperse the 
strikers,

2933
02:51:20,880 --> 02:51:25,880
so the government is now going in and 
sending strike leaders to the front to 

2934
02:51:25,880 --> 02:51:25,880
get them out of the way.

2935
02:51:25,880 --> 02:51:30,680
I mean,
the society is under severe stress and 

2936
02:51:30,680 --> 02:51:30,680
we already talked about the food.
I mean,

2937
02:51:30,680 --> 02:51:34,260
there's a quote from earns glazer that 
that sums it up when he talks about this

2938
02:51:34,261 --> 02:51:35,700
period they're in now and he,
he says,

2939
02:51:35,701 --> 02:51:37,770
quote soon,
alluded ham,

2940
02:51:37,771 --> 02:51:42,771
thrilled us more than the fall of 
Bucharest or some of parents success 

2941
02:51:42,771 --> 02:51:46,251
elsewhere,
and to quote these people's needs have 

2942
02:51:46,251 --> 02:51:47,700
shrunk down to the most basic human 
survival levels.

2943
02:51:48,300 --> 02:51:48,870
Yeah,
great.

2944
02:51:48,871 --> 02:51:51,030
We took Bucharest,
but did you see that hand we have in the

2945
02:51:51,031 --> 02:51:52,200
cellar that we found?
I mean,

2946
02:51:52,201 --> 02:51:57,201
you know,
that's something any of us could 

2947
02:51:57,201 --> 02:51:59,661
understand if we began to starve.
The pressure is on Germany's military 

2948
02:51:59,661 --> 02:52:04,221
leadership to do something.
You can't very well launching offensive 

2949
02:52:04,221 --> 02:52:04,290
on the western front when you're 
outnumbered the way you are,

2950
02:52:04,291 --> 02:52:06,010
you're going to be lucky to survive at 
all.

2951
02:52:06,170 --> 02:52:08,770
Nineteen 16 was terrible for the Germans
on the western front,

2952
02:52:08,920 --> 02:52:13,920
so you launch the submarines and that 
becomes your chance to win the war 

2953
02:52:13,920 --> 02:52:16,240
without having to do the impossible.
On the western front.

2954
02:52:17,870 --> 02:52:21,170
Now alluded,
Dorf is a very strange guy.

2955
02:52:21,171 --> 02:52:23,000
This is commander of Germany,
you know,

2956
02:52:23,001 --> 02:52:25,910
sort of in more every day in this story.
Hindenburg,

2957
02:52:25,911 --> 02:52:29,030
his partner is the charisma guy,
but he's an old man.

2958
02:52:29,031 --> 02:52:34,031
He really,
if he had been great at one time in his 

2959
02:52:34,031 --> 02:52:34,031
life,
he's in his dotage now and he's,

2960
02:52:34,031 --> 02:52:36,020
he's the revered public face of this 
government,

2961
02:52:36,021 --> 02:52:41,021
but lewd indoors doors,
the guy behind the scenes and we talked 

2962
02:52:41,021 --> 02:52:42,050
about him and he's the one who way back 
in 1914,

2963
02:52:42,051 --> 02:52:47,051
got that city in Belgium to surrender by
banging on the front doors with the hilt

2964
02:52:47,271 --> 02:52:48,740
of his sword,
you know,

2965
02:52:48,760 --> 02:52:53,760
when he easily could have been killed,
walked right up to the front door loan 

2966
02:52:53,760 --> 02:52:53,760
guide.
I mean,

2967
02:52:53,760 --> 02:52:54,380
that's,
he's an interesting guy.

2968
02:52:54,590 --> 02:52:59,590
He's flawed in a lot of ways.
And depending on which historian you 

2969
02:52:59,590 --> 02:52:59,590
grabbed,
your going to hear the,

2970
02:52:59,590 --> 02:53:00,800
the bumbling,
uh,

2971
02:53:00,890 --> 02:53:05,890
psychologically fragile Luton door for,
you're going to see this is great 

2972
02:53:05,890 --> 02:53:05,890
gambler,
who was,

2973
02:53:05,890 --> 02:53:07,550
who was fantastic at certain things.

2974
02:53:07,550 --> 02:53:10,330
And remember,
all these generals are 19th century men.

2975
02:53:10,890 --> 02:53:15,650
They are adapting under fire at a quick 
pace to all these new conditions.

2976
02:53:15,890 --> 02:53:17,570
And just when you think they are getting
it,

2977
02:53:17,780 --> 02:53:22,780
some new development comes around,
maybe you're starting to understand the 

2978
02:53:22,780 --> 02:53:23,450
physics of land warfare a year or two 
into the first world war.

2979
02:53:23,451 --> 02:53:26,990
If you're a general and then tanks 
appear and then gas appears.

2980
02:53:26,991 --> 02:53:28,580
I mean,
what do you do with all this airplane?

2981
02:53:28,581 --> 02:53:31,520
Start having a real impact.
You don't just have to learn.

2982
02:53:31,670 --> 02:53:36,670
You have to be flexible to continue to 
evolve as these generals and nobody's 

2983
02:53:36,670 --> 02:53:37,880
great at it.
Luton doors,

2984
02:53:37,881 --> 02:53:41,430
not bad.
Ludendorff changes.

2985
02:53:41,431 --> 02:53:46,431
By the way,
the basic strategy of the guy who came 

2986
02:53:46,431 --> 02:53:46,470
before him,
Fun Falcon Heights strategy was,

2987
02:53:46,560 --> 02:53:51,560
you know,
basically defend every inch of 

2988
02:53:51,560 --> 02:53:51,560
territory.
Luton.

2989
02:53:51,560 --> 02:53:54,561
Dorf is perfectly willing to give up 
territory in exchange for killing 

2990
02:53:54,561 --> 02:53:54,561
people.

2991
02:53:54,750 --> 02:53:59,750
He'll pull off things like operation 
Alberico right about this time period 

2992
02:53:59,750 --> 02:54:03,600
starts in late February,
1917 where he will pull back troops that

2993
02:54:03,601 --> 02:54:06,150
are,
that are in unexposed loop in the line.

2994
02:54:06,151 --> 02:54:08,670
The line isn't straight because of 
fighting here and there.

2995
02:54:08,910 --> 02:54:11,550
It's bulging out in some places and 
there are kinks in it.

2996
02:54:11,700 --> 02:54:15,120
And he begins in early 1917 to pull 
troops back that are,

2997
02:54:15,300 --> 02:54:18,690
that are way out there in no man's land 
and straightened up his line.

2998
02:54:18,691 --> 02:54:22,380
He'll cut off like 25 miles from the 
western front by doing this,

2999
02:54:23,040 --> 02:54:28,040
freeing up 13 or 14 divisions as 
basically a German army to be used 

3000
02:54:28,040 --> 02:54:28,470
elsewhere.

3001
02:54:29,440 --> 02:54:34,440
Now that's a complicated maneuver,
but his strategy in 1917 as far as he's 

3002
02:54:34,440 --> 02:54:35,440
concerned,
is going to be defense.

3003
02:54:35,860 --> 02:54:38,680
So he's going to line things up and 
prepare for that.

3004
02:54:38,681 --> 02:54:40,420
And it gives him all kinds of 
advantages.

3005
02:54:40,421 --> 02:54:45,421
This is one area,
it will be called the Hindenburg line 

3006
02:54:45,421 --> 02:54:48,250
that he puts together.
It's hard to imagine making the defenses

3007
02:54:48,251 --> 02:54:53,140
of 1916 deeper and stronger and more 
impenetrable,

3008
02:54:53,170 --> 02:54:58,170
but that's what they do in 1917.
The hindenburg line is an example of 

3009
02:54:58,170 --> 02:54:59,950
Luton.
Doris idea of defense in depth.

3010
02:54:59,951 --> 02:55:04,951
And what that means is as the German 
defenses go back and they're designed to

3011
02:55:05,721 --> 02:55:08,660
act like a rubber band so that when 
something runs into them,

3012
02:55:08,900 --> 02:55:10,700
it just stretches and stretches and 
stretches,

3013
02:55:10,701 --> 02:55:13,430
and the farther it stretches,
the more resistance you find.

3014
02:55:13,670 --> 02:55:18,670
And then eventually just snaps back.
It's devious mean the way it's designed 

3015
02:55:19,370 --> 02:55:20,990
and I don't need to get into all the 
details.

3016
02:55:21,020 --> 02:55:26,020
It's the machine guns and the barbed 
wire and the pillboxes and all these 

3017
02:55:26,020 --> 02:55:28,901
things,
but they just go far back into the 

3018
02:55:28,901 --> 02:55:31,241
distance and there's no more trenches 
anywhere near the front lines because 

3019
02:55:31,241 --> 02:55:34,511
those are too easy to pick out and 
everybody just sort of sits in holes in 

3020
02:55:34,511 --> 02:55:36,920
the ground and the sort of a random 
pattern and there's no line.

3021
02:55:37,820 --> 02:55:42,820
In fact,
there's hardly any Germans when you 

3022
02:55:42,820 --> 02:55:44,591
first get to it.
It's just a few Germans holding you up 

3023
02:55:44,591 --> 02:55:45,860
and taking casualties and then as soon 
as they can't keep you at bay anymore,

3024
02:55:46,010 --> 02:55:51,010
they retreat back to the next line and 
then do the next line and every step of 

3025
02:55:51,010 --> 02:55:55,001
the way.
The defenses are a little bit stronger 

3026
02:55:55,001 --> 02:55:55,001
and the Germans are a little bit more 
numerous.

3027
02:55:55,001 --> 02:55:58,220
As the British or the French who are 
attacking them are getting less and less

3028
02:55:58,221 --> 02:56:00,680
numerous and then as they're getting 
more tired.

3029
02:56:00,680 --> 02:56:01,670
I mean,
I thought to myself,

3030
02:56:01,820 --> 02:56:04,610
some of these defenses go back nine,
10 miles.

3031
02:56:04,670 --> 02:56:09,670
It would kill me without any resistance.
Imagine trying to do it with machine 

3032
02:56:09,670 --> 02:56:14,220
guns and rifle fire and grenades and 
artillery and I mean it just,

3033
02:56:14,270 --> 02:56:19,270
it's.
You just can't imagine having much left 

3034
02:56:19,270 --> 02:56:21,920
if you even get the nine or 10 miles to 
the end of the defenses and then waiting

3035
02:56:21,921 --> 02:56:26,090
for you.
There are German armies who are going to

3036
02:56:26,091 --> 02:56:31,091
counterattack anything that's left that 
makes it all the way through these 

3037
02:56:31,091 --> 02:56:34,580
defenses.
It is absolutely almost impenetrable and

3038
02:56:34,581 --> 02:56:36,230
devious.
If you only have two and a half,

3039
02:56:36,231 --> 02:56:41,231
two point $8 million men to fight four 
or four and a half million men on the 

3040
02:56:41,231 --> 02:56:43,700
other side.
This is a good way to equalize the odds.

3041
02:56:43,880 --> 02:56:48,880
This is a weightlifter who's figured out
a way to lift more than a bigger 

3042
02:56:48,880 --> 02:56:48,950
opponent.

3043
02:56:49,910 --> 02:56:54,910
My favorite part of the Hindenburg line 
defenses as a military history fan is 

3044
02:56:54,910 --> 02:56:58,910
that they build a giant moat in front of
it.

3045
02:56:58,911 --> 02:57:00,660
I mean,
there's no other way to phrase it.

3046
02:57:00,661 --> 02:57:05,661
It's an absolutely perpendicular wall 
trench that is between nine and 10 feet 

3047
02:57:06,650 --> 02:57:11,650
deep and 12 feet across.
It's meant to stop everything tanks 

3048
02:57:11,991 --> 02:57:16,991
especially mean fall into there and 
won't be able to climb up the 

3049
02:57:16,991 --> 02:57:19,841
perpendicular side,
but it's not an easy job for troops 

3050
02:57:19,841 --> 02:57:23,030
either and behind this giant moat,
as you might imagine,

3051
02:57:23,031 --> 02:57:28,031
our machine gun positions and all kinds 
of defenses and more wire and all these 

3052
02:57:28,031 --> 02:57:31,841
sorts of things.
It is crazy to think about having to 

3053
02:57:31,841 --> 02:57:35,021
attack something like that and what's 
more when Luton Dorf has people retreat 

3054
02:57:36,140 --> 02:57:40,910
sort of toward the Hindenburg line and 
give up these positions that hundreds of

3055
02:57:40,910 --> 02:57:44,420
thousands of Germans had died contesting
over the last couple of years.

3056
02:57:44,780 --> 02:57:49,250
He has soldiers destroy everything you 
know as they go,

3057
02:57:49,700 --> 02:57:52,940
creating a dead zone from the old 
frontline to the new one,

3058
02:57:53,420 --> 02:57:58,420
a scorched earth policy,
something which by the way upset crown 

3059
02:57:58,420 --> 02:58:01,080
prince rubric to was the Field Marshal 
commanding some of the troops who had to

3060
02:58:01,081 --> 02:58:01,980
do this destruction.

3061
02:58:02,280 --> 02:58:07,280
He was so upset.
He almost resigned over it and 

3062
02:58:07,280 --> 02:58:07,280
complained about,
you know,

3063
02:58:07,280 --> 02:58:07,650
how this would hurt Germany's 
reputation.

3064
02:58:07,651 --> 02:58:12,651
And in that discussion,
you basically see a 19th century of 

3065
02:58:12,651 --> 02:58:16,671
figure with 19th century standards,
crown prince rubric to member of the 

3066
02:58:16,671 --> 02:58:20,091
Bavarian royalty and Luton Dorf a 
thoroughly 20th century,

3067
02:58:20,221 --> 02:58:23,280
total war kind of guy.
It's a clash of cultures.

3068
02:58:23,580 --> 02:58:28,470
The 20th century one Ludendorff got his 
way and the troops of the German army in

3069
02:58:28,471 --> 02:58:33,471
a very old school style began creating a
dead zone in this part of France in 

3070
02:58:35,281 --> 02:58:38,670
front of the Hindenburg line and a dead 
zone that extended in some places.

3071
02:58:38,671 --> 02:58:42,470
Twenty miles,
German soldier Ernst,

3072
02:58:42,471 --> 02:58:46,440
young or was there watching the 
destruction take place.

3073
02:58:47,130 --> 02:58:50,340
And he compares it to a kind of lunacy.
I mean,

3074
02:58:50,370 --> 02:58:55,370
it's funny because if you think about 
people doing this in the Second World 

3075
02:58:55,370 --> 02:58:58,310
War,
you think about them using mostly 

3076
02:58:58,310 --> 02:58:58,350
explosives and they were explosives used
to create this dead zone,

3077
02:58:58,351 --> 02:59:00,150
but Germany needed her explosives.

3078
02:59:00,300 --> 02:59:05,300
And so a lot of this stuff was done by 
hand and younger says it had a bad 

3079
02:59:05,761 --> 02:59:08,970
effect on the troops.
And he also blamed some of it on what he

3080
02:59:08,971 --> 02:59:13,050
calls the economic times we live in or 
something like that.

3081
02:59:13,051 --> 02:59:17,970
And what he really means by that is this
total war 20th century sort of mentality

3082
02:59:18,330 --> 02:59:22,860
younger writes about passing through 
this dead zone that was being created by

3083
02:59:22,861 --> 02:59:27,861
the German army.
As it moved backwards towards its main 

3084
02:59:27,861 --> 02:59:31,161
line quote,
the villages we pass through on our way 

3085
02:59:31,161 --> 02:59:34,730
had the look of vast lunatic asylums.
Whole companies were set to knocking or 

3086
02:59:34,730 --> 02:59:37,110
pulling down walls or sitting on 
rooftops,

3087
02:59:37,111 --> 02:59:39,750
uprooting the tiles.
Trees were cut down,

3088
02:59:39,900 --> 02:59:44,900
windows smashed wherever you looked.
Clouds of smoke and dust rose from vast 

3089
02:59:44,900 --> 02:59:49,551
piles of debris.
We saw men dashing about wearing suits 

3090
02:59:49,551 --> 02:59:52,650
and dresses left behind by the 
inhabitants with top hats on their heads

3091
02:59:52,920 --> 02:59:54,360
with destructive cunning.

3092
02:59:54,510 --> 02:59:58,080
They found the roof trees of the houses,
fixed ropes to them,

3093
02:59:58,230 --> 03:00:02,310
and then with concerted shouts polled 
until they all came tumbling down,

3094
03:00:02,550 --> 03:00:07,550
others were swinging pile driving 
hammers and wind around smashing 

3095
03:00:07,550 --> 03:00:11,721
everything that got in their way from 
the flower pots on the window sills to 

3096
03:00:11,721 --> 03:00:14,490
whole ornate conservatories as far back 
as the siegfried line.

3097
03:00:14,670 --> 03:00:16,770
That's what the Germans called the 
Hindenburg line.

3098
03:00:17,160 --> 03:00:21,030
Every village was reduced to rubble.
Every tree chopped down.

3099
03:00:21,120 --> 03:00:24,120
Every road undermined every well 
poisoned.

3100
03:00:24,121 --> 03:00:26,400
Every basement blown up or booby 
trapped,

3101
03:00:26,520 --> 03:00:30,060
every rail unscrewed,
every telephone wire rolled up.

3102
03:00:30,270 --> 03:00:35,270
Everything burnable burned in a word.
We were turning the country that are 

3103
03:00:35,270 --> 03:00:37,560
advancing.
Opponents would occupy into a wasteland.

3104
03:00:37,740 --> 03:00:39,030
As I say,
he writes,

3105
03:00:39,150 --> 03:00:44,150
the scenes were reminiscent of a 
madhouse and the effect on the men was 

3106
03:00:44,150 --> 03:00:45,810
similar.
Half funny half repellent.

3107
03:00:46,080 --> 03:00:47,970
They were also,
we could see right away,

3108
03:00:48,150 --> 03:00:53,150
bad for the men's morale and honor here 
for the first time I witnessed wanton 

3109
03:00:53,150 --> 03:00:54,510
destruction that I was later in life to 
see,

3110
03:00:54,511 --> 03:00:55,320
to access.

3111
03:00:55,590 --> 03:01:00,590
This is something that has unhealthfully
bound up with the economic thinking of 

3112
03:01:00,590 --> 03:01:04,081
our age,
but it does more harm than good to the 

3113
03:01:04,081 --> 03:01:05,200
destroyer and dishonors the soldier and 
quote,

3114
03:01:06,580 --> 03:01:10,510
and it should be remembered.
The decision to award damaged country.

3115
03:01:10,511 --> 03:01:15,511
This,
this area that they are pulling apart 

3116
03:01:15,511 --> 03:01:17,461
now in creating a dead zone,
was an idyllic part of France that 

3117
03:01:17,461 --> 03:01:18,100
wasn't touched by the war.
If you weren't right on the front in the

3118
03:01:18,101 --> 03:01:20,140
first world war,
especially in the western front,

3119
03:01:20,350 --> 03:01:23,830
things were great behind it.
One of the complaints French soldiers on

3120
03:01:23,831 --> 03:01:28,831
leave have is you can get 20 or 30 miles
behind the front line and everything is 

3121
03:01:28,831 --> 03:01:30,960
like there's not even a war going on,
you know,

3122
03:01:30,970 --> 03:01:34,420
they see men with their sweethearts 
prowling around going to restaurants for

3123
03:01:34,421 --> 03:01:36,820
dinner in a town 30 miles from the 
front,

3124
03:01:36,821 --> 03:01:41,821
and it's like it's another world,
so they're tearing down these beautiful 

3125
03:01:41,821 --> 03:01:44,260
parts of France to create this dead 
zone.

3126
03:01:44,260 --> 03:01:49,260
They're destroying everything and then 
they're leaving booby traps behind 

3127
03:01:49,931 --> 03:01:52,060
because when the Germans give up their 
positions,

3128
03:01:52,300 --> 03:01:53,740
they're going to retreat.
As I said,

3129
03:01:53,741 --> 03:01:57,700
sometimes 20 miles in this one area all 
the way back to the main line.

3130
03:01:58,150 --> 03:02:01,930
The allies are going to follow them when
they follow them,

3131
03:02:01,931 --> 03:02:04,690
they're going to run into these towns.
When they run into these towns,

3132
03:02:04,840 --> 03:02:07,630
they're going to run into and younger.
Talked about it earlier,

3133
03:02:07,631 --> 03:02:09,010
booby traps.
Here's what he said,

3134
03:02:09,040 --> 03:02:14,040
quote,
among the surprises we prepared for our 

3135
03:02:14,040 --> 03:02:15,130
successors were some truly malicious 
inventions,

3136
03:02:15,400 --> 03:02:17,800
very fine wires,
almost invisible.

3137
03:02:17,890 --> 03:02:20,890
We're stretched across the entrance of 
buildings and shelters,

3138
03:02:21,130 --> 03:02:25,540
which set off explosive charges at the 
faintest touch in some places.

3139
03:02:25,690 --> 03:02:29,650
Narrow ditches were dug,
a crossroads and shells hidden in them.

3140
03:02:29,800 --> 03:02:33,610
They were then covered over by a large 
plank and had earth strewn over them,

3141
03:02:33,790 --> 03:02:37,750
and nail had been driven into the plank 
only just above the shelf use.

3142
03:02:37,960 --> 03:02:41,830
The space was measured so that marching 
troops could pass over the spot safely,

3143
03:02:41,980 --> 03:02:44,830
but the moment the first truck or field 
gun rumbled up,

3144
03:02:45,010 --> 03:02:50,010
the board would give and the nail would 
touch off the shell or there were 

3145
03:02:50,010 --> 03:02:52,750
spiteful time bombs that were buried in 
the basements of undamaged buildings.

3146
03:02:52,960 --> 03:02:56,890
They consisted of two sections with a 
metal partition going down the middle in

3147
03:02:56,891 --> 03:02:59,440
one part was explosive in the other 
acid.

3148
03:02:59,680 --> 03:03:01,780
After these devils eggs,
he calls them,

3149
03:03:01,781 --> 03:03:06,781
had been primed and hidden.
The acids slowly over weeks eroded the 

3150
03:03:06,781 --> 03:03:08,440
metal partition and then set off the 
bomb.

3151
03:03:09,010 --> 03:03:14,010
In quote British reporter Philip Gibbs 
went through some of these towns right 

3152
03:03:14,010 --> 03:03:15,610
after younger and his men had vacated 
them,

3153
03:03:15,700 --> 03:03:20,700
and allied forces had moved in and 
Gibb's talks about all those same kinds 

3154
03:03:20,700 --> 03:03:24,901
of booby traps and then says this quote,
only a few of our men were killed or 

3155
03:03:25,421 --> 03:03:30,421
blinded by these monkey tricks.
Are Engineers found most of them before 

3156
03:03:30,421 --> 03:03:34,171
they were touched off,
but one went down dugouts or into ruin 

3157
03:03:34,171 --> 03:03:37,060
houses with a sense of imminent danger 
all through the devastated region.

3158
03:03:37,210 --> 03:03:42,070
One walked with an uncanny feeling of an
evil spirit left behind by the masses of

3159
03:03:42,071 --> 03:03:46,510
men whose bodies had gone away.
It exuded from scraps of old clothing.

3160
03:03:46,720 --> 03:03:50,170
It was in the stench of the dugouts and 
in the ruins that they had made,

3161
03:03:50,530 --> 03:03:55,330
and to quote a booby trap,
dead zone,

3162
03:03:56,140 --> 03:03:58,170
Lewd endorphins,
a fully 20th

3163
03:03:58,170 --> 03:04:00,720
century total war commander,

3164
03:04:03,600 --> 03:04:08,600
and this is a big move.
This is pulling a big rabbit out of a 

3165
03:04:08,600 --> 03:04:08,600
hat and it's,
you know,

3166
03:04:08,600 --> 03:04:09,750
if you're a military history fan like I 
am,

3167
03:04:09,960 --> 03:04:12,150
it's what makes alluded door.
So interesting.

3168
03:04:12,300 --> 03:04:17,300
Not a lot of generals would pull this 
kind of stunt and it was a game changer 

3169
03:04:17,300 --> 03:04:19,410
in many respects.
I mean that whole dead zone for example,

3170
03:04:19,890 --> 03:04:24,360
proved to be a huge problem for British 
and French forces to try to overcome.

3171
03:04:24,600 --> 03:04:29,600
They move into this cratered,
destroyed denuded area where even the 

3172
03:04:29,971 --> 03:04:32,940
wells have been poisoned.
How do you even supply that?

3173
03:04:33,840 --> 03:04:38,840
The Germans on the other hand,
they've moved to sites they'd been 

3174
03:04:38,840 --> 03:04:41,061
working on for months.
Some parts of the Hindenburg line have 

3175
03:04:41,061 --> 03:04:44,571
had half a million workers working on it
for months and months and months and 

3176
03:04:44,571 --> 03:04:46,650
building a new front line from scratch.
It's like building a new home.

3177
03:04:46,800 --> 03:04:48,240
It was now moving.
Ready.

3178
03:04:48,330 --> 03:04:53,330
They moved back into it and there are 
railroads bringing supplies up to the 

3179
03:04:53,330 --> 03:04:56,610
back.
What Luton Dorf did was wrong foot.

3180
03:04:57,000 --> 03:04:59,100
The allies he stolen night,
March.

3181
03:04:59,101 --> 03:05:04,101
He sees the initiative.
He changed their plans for 1917 without 

3182
03:05:04,681 --> 03:05:07,680
knowing what their plans were.
He simply figured,

3183
03:05:07,681 --> 03:05:12,681
if I do this,
all the planning they've been doing for 

3184
03:05:12,681 --> 03:05:15,021
months will be obsolete.
They're planning to have me 20 miles 

3185
03:05:16,050 --> 03:05:18,000
closer to Paris than I am.

3186
03:05:20,180 --> 03:05:23,000
If you were an ally general,
how would you deal with this problem?

3187
03:05:24,110 --> 03:05:26,180
And if you said you don't want to deal 
with this problem,

3188
03:05:26,181 --> 03:05:28,040
that this looks like an impenetrable 
nightmare,

3189
03:05:28,250 --> 03:05:33,250
that just puts you in league with those 
military thinkers at the time who were 

3190
03:05:33,250 --> 03:05:37,871
known as easterners.
These people who thought attacking on 

3191
03:05:37,871 --> 03:05:40,610
the western front was insane.
Look at the defenses.

3192
03:05:40,611 --> 03:05:43,970
Who would do that?
The prime minister of Britain,

3193
03:05:43,971 --> 03:05:45,770
Lloyd George is one of these guys.

3194
03:05:46,980 --> 03:05:51,980
Here's the thing though.
You can always find generals and 

3195
03:05:51,980 --> 03:05:56,181
military commanders who no matter how 
impossible the military task looks,

3196
03:05:57,870 --> 03:06:02,870
will be optimistic about explaining to 
you how their plan will overcome it 

3197
03:06:03,240 --> 03:06:08,240
after all,
people don't get those jobs by 

3198
03:06:08,240 --> 03:06:09,690
explaining how they can't overcome the 
enemy's defenses.

3199
03:06:10,680 --> 03:06:12,900
We told you earlier that the French 
sack,

3200
03:06:13,200 --> 03:06:16,080
their military leader that they've had 
since the beginning of the wars you also

3201
03:06:16,081 --> 03:06:17,730
shot for and they sort of,
you know,

3202
03:06:17,731 --> 03:06:22,731
kick him upstairs and before they do,
they have another one of those yearly 

3203
03:06:22,731 --> 03:06:26,511
meetings where all the allies,
the Russians and the British and the 

3204
03:06:26,511 --> 03:06:29,331
French and all the other allies,
they get together and they had this 

3205
03:06:29,331 --> 03:06:29,331
meeting and they try to coordinate next 
years,

3206
03:06:29,331 --> 03:06:32,991
military plans so that when the British 
and the French attack on the western 

3207
03:06:32,991 --> 03:06:37,311
front,
the Russians at the same time attack on 

3208
03:06:37,311 --> 03:06:38,991
the east and the Italians attack in the 
south and everybody's pushing in 

3209
03:06:38,991 --> 03:06:39,450
multiple directions all at once.
Forcing the Germans to,

3210
03:06:39,870 --> 03:06:42,090
you know,
maybe break somewhere.

3211
03:06:42,091 --> 03:06:47,091
I mean,
the central powers at this point are 

3212
03:06:47,091 --> 03:06:48,660
like an egg and as soon as you can break
into any one of their sides,

3213
03:06:48,661 --> 03:06:49,290
east,
west,

3214
03:06:49,291 --> 03:06:49,950
north,
south,

3215
03:06:49,951 --> 03:06:52,050
I mean you feel like the war would be 
over,

3216
03:06:52,290 --> 03:06:57,290
but they're all holding steady,
but most commanders are looking the 

3217
03:06:57,290 --> 03:06:57,900
western front and say,
but nothing's as steady as that.

3218
03:07:00,180 --> 03:07:03,420
Must we attack it?
Will the French had always believed,

3219
03:07:03,421 --> 03:07:04,080
yes,
you must.

3220
03:07:04,100 --> 03:07:09,100
And of course they were a little biased 
because the Germans are on their soil 

3221
03:07:09,100 --> 03:07:11,871
and they would like to see them pushed 
off when Joseph Jaffra is asked in late 

3222
03:07:11,971 --> 03:07:15,180
1916 at the big meeting,
what are we going to do in 1917?

3223
03:07:15,181 --> 03:07:20,181
What's the plan?
Jennifer tells them his plan is a 

3224
03:07:20,181 --> 03:07:21,120
repetition of the somme.
The battle that was just wrapping up the

3225
03:07:21,121 --> 03:07:24,660
battle that was so horrible for British 
and even for French forces,

3226
03:07:26,190 --> 03:07:27,990
gonna where the Germans down in,
in,

3227
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:28,320
in,
uh,

3228
03:07:28,321 --> 03:07:33,321
several months long battle that forces 
them to throw in the last of their 

3229
03:07:33,321 --> 03:07:36,470
resources.
French politicians were horrified by 

3230
03:07:36,470 --> 03:07:39,201
this.
The last thing they wanted is a battle 

3231
03:07:39,201 --> 03:07:39,201
like that because as far as they were 
concerned,

3232
03:07:39,240 --> 03:07:41,700
how did anybody know that it wouldn't be
the French nation,

3233
03:07:41,940 --> 03:07:44,070
the through in all their resources,
and man,

3234
03:07:46,370 --> 03:07:48,950
this is part of the reason is you offer 
got kicked upstairs.

3235
03:07:49,520 --> 03:07:53,260
The French politicians had had enough 
just like British politicians.

3236
03:07:53,530 --> 03:07:58,180
They were starting to do the unthinkable
in terms of 19th century attitudes.

3237
03:07:58,630 --> 03:08:03,630
They were starting to interfere with 
military decisions because they were 

3238
03:08:03,630 --> 03:08:07,141
losing faith that the people making the 
military decisions had the right 

3239
03:08:07,141 --> 03:08:09,760
priorities.
The politicians were

3240
03:08:10,510 --> 03:08:14,680
worried about the casualty totals.
One of the big criticisms,

3241
03:08:14,681 --> 03:08:16,570
especially from the soldiers in the 
field,

3242
03:08:17,050 --> 03:08:22,050
is that the generals weren't the guy who
gets the job as the main allied military

3243
03:08:22,491 --> 03:08:27,491
commander in 1917 we mentioned earlier 
is a guy named Robert and evil and evil 

3244
03:08:27,491 --> 03:08:31,930
gets this job because he's the guy out 
there optimistic about victory.

3245
03:08:32,420 --> 03:08:34,430
Remember,
generals do not get hired,

3246
03:08:35,210 --> 03:08:38,120
promising to not overcome the enemy's 
defenses,

3247
03:08:38,210 --> 03:08:41,390
so there's an ingrown bias in the whole 
process,

3248
03:08:42,090 --> 03:08:47,090
but Robert and Israel tells the French 
leadership when he takes over that you 

3249
03:08:47,461 --> 03:08:49,230
don't have to have another battle of the
somme.

3250
03:08:49,231 --> 03:08:51,030
You don't have to have a grinding 
months,

3251
03:08:51,031 --> 03:08:54,450
long battle.
You can have a lightning bolt,

3252
03:08:54,780 --> 03:08:59,780
sort of hammer stroke that just ends the
war in 48 hours.

3253
03:09:01,970 --> 03:09:03,230
Now it sounds crazy,
doesn't it?

3254
03:09:03,280 --> 03:09:08,280
There were a bunch of French general,
some of whom Nouvelle leapfrogged over.

3255
03:09:08,770 --> 03:09:10,730
Uh,
they were guys who probably deserved the

3256
03:09:10,731 --> 03:09:13,880
job at least three,
maybe four more than Nevada,

3257
03:09:13,881 --> 03:09:17,180
but Nevada was this.
He's a charmer.

3258
03:09:17,210 --> 03:09:17,570
I mean,
he's,

3259
03:09:17,571 --> 03:09:20,210
he's one of these people that can win 
anyone over.

3260
03:09:20,570 --> 03:09:22,850
He's not winning over these jealous 
generals.

3261
03:09:22,851 --> 03:09:27,851
He leapfrogged.
But there's a lot of politicians that 

3262
03:09:27,851 --> 03:09:30,341
are,
are sold with Nivo and some of them 

3263
03:09:30,341 --> 03:09:33,401
aren't.
Even French novel has this great 

3264
03:09:33,401 --> 03:09:33,401
advantage over the other French,

3265
03:09:33,401 --> 03:09:34,590
you know,
military leaders,

3266
03:09:34,980 --> 03:09:37,830
he speaks English,
he speaks it perfectly.

3267
03:09:37,831 --> 03:09:40,290
He speaks it without an accent.
His mother's English.

3268
03:09:41,670 --> 03:09:44,640
So he's a charmer to begin with kind of 
a salesman.

3269
03:09:44,670 --> 03:09:47,400
But people like him,
he doesn't feel slimy or sleazy.

3270
03:09:47,760 --> 03:09:52,760
Um,
he sort of an optimist and he goes over 

3271
03:09:52,760 --> 03:09:55,401
to Britain and he wins over even the 
arch easterner Lloyd George

3272
03:09:57,600 --> 03:10:00,810
that was in there and explains to the 
British exactly how this plan to rupture

3273
03:10:00,811 --> 03:10:05,460
the enemy lines will work and it 
involves creating a reserve of 27,

3274
03:10:05,461 --> 03:10:09,690
28 divisions that are going to be like 
the spider in the web and as soon as the

3275
03:10:09,691 --> 03:10:13,590
Germans are held in certain places and 
weakened and then this 27 divisions will

3276
03:10:13,591 --> 03:10:16,260
go get them and it's going to take 48 
hours.

3277
03:10:17,520 --> 03:10:21,270
And like any good salesman offering sort
of a money back guarantee,

3278
03:10:21,660 --> 03:10:26,660
there's a guarantee in this deal.
And the guarantee that naval tells 

3279
03:10:26,660 --> 03:10:27,510
everybody is if it doesn't work in 48 
hours,

3280
03:10:27,511 --> 03:10:32,511
we'll call it off after that.
Now that's a promise to get rid of the 

3281
03:10:32,551 --> 03:10:37,551
part of these battles that's most 
troubling to people who care about dead 

3282
03:10:37,551 --> 03:10:38,160
people.
A lot of the dead people,

3283
03:10:39,280 --> 03:10:44,280
unless you have just tragic first day,
it's like the battle of the Somme and 

3284
03:10:44,280 --> 03:10:45,970
the battle of the frontiers.
A lot of the deaths happen because these

3285
03:10:45,971 --> 03:10:48,610
battles go on for months.
If you could end them after 48 hours,

3286
03:10:48,611 --> 03:10:50,710
if you had a chance to see is it working
or not working,

3287
03:10:50,711 --> 03:10:51,790
call it off.
It's not working.

3288
03:10:52,090 --> 03:10:57,090
That takes a lot of the risk out of it 
and you can see why politicians would 

3289
03:10:57,090 --> 03:10:59,971
like that plan a lot more than just 
saying let's have another four or five 

3290
03:10:59,971 --> 03:11:00,910
months long battle.

3291
03:11:03,540 --> 03:11:05,530
The problem is,
in hindsight,

3292
03:11:05,540 --> 03:11:10,540
as everyone knows,
nouvelle was working on a on an idea 

3293
03:11:10,540 --> 03:11:10,950
that might not have been tenable.

3294
03:11:12,860 --> 03:11:16,250
Novell made his name at the battle of 
Verdun at the very last stages of it.

3295
03:11:16,251 --> 03:11:18,500
When the Germans were being pushed back 
in the other direction.

3296
03:11:18,980 --> 03:11:23,980
There's a lot of historical debate over 
whether or not anything novel did was 

3297
03:11:23,980 --> 03:11:25,580
effective,
but even if it was effective,

3298
03:11:25,581 --> 03:11:28,730
it was effective at a very,
very low level to all of a sudden be the

3299
03:11:28,731 --> 03:11:31,820
military leader in charge of not just 
all of Francis forces,

3300
03:11:32,300 --> 03:11:37,300
but kind of Britain's forces to who he 
will clash and avail will clash with 

3301
03:11:37,300 --> 03:11:38,660
Britain's commander Douglas Haig.
They do not like each other.

3302
03:11:38,661 --> 03:11:41,420
The Egos of generals,
our proverbial anyway,

3303
03:11:41,600 --> 03:11:44,540
and these two guys will fight in them,
will create problems between Britain and

3304
03:11:44,541 --> 03:11:46,190
France as allies.
Nonetheless,

3305
03:11:46,191 --> 03:11:51,191
novellas,
the most powerful military commander on 

3306
03:11:51,191 --> 03:11:51,440
the western front.
He's never commanded forces like this.

3307
03:11:52,670 --> 03:11:57,530
His first real problem happens when the 
Germans pull this,

3308
03:11:57,680 --> 03:12:02,680
you know,
operation Albert and disappear and it 

3309
03:12:02,761 --> 03:12:07,761
reminds me a little of the British 
getting away at Gullapalli and fooling 

3310
03:12:07,761 --> 03:12:08,640
the Turks so that the Turks didn't know 
that they'd left.

3311
03:12:09,570 --> 03:12:13,410
Now the Germans just kind of pull back 
from this giant salient and wait for the

3312
03:12:13,411 --> 03:12:14,940
British to find out they're gone.

3313
03:12:16,910 --> 03:12:18,850
And I love the way it starts by the way 
it starts with,

3314
03:12:19,030 --> 03:12:24,030
with the British looking out over their 
trenches and seeing the German trenches 

3315
03:12:24,030 --> 03:12:27,910
being shelled and then coming to the 
realization that the German trenches 

3316
03:12:27,910 --> 03:12:32,050
that they,
that they're facing off against her 

3317
03:12:32,050 --> 03:12:34,151
being shelled by Germans and it's a 
German artillery blowing up the trenches

3318
03:12:34,161 --> 03:12:39,161
and destroying everything of value in it
and then destroying the trenches so the 

3319
03:12:39,161 --> 03:12:39,350
British can't move up into them and use 
them.

3320
03:12:40,790 --> 03:12:43,520
And then of course the probing.
It must have been Erie.

3321
03:12:43,760 --> 03:12:48,760
There were like single Germans left 
behind to shoot a rifle off every now 

3322
03:12:48,760 --> 03:12:50,300
and then and just keep the allied armies
from pursuing too closely,

3323
03:12:50,840 --> 03:12:53,930
but it was clear that the Germans were 
pulling back,

3324
03:12:53,960 --> 03:12:55,010
you know,
miles and miles,

3325
03:12:55,011 --> 03:13:00,011
churchill had said like 50 miles.
Every place I read said more like 20 at 

3326
03:13:00,011 --> 03:13:03,281
the farthest,
but nonetheless to pull back that far 

3327
03:13:03,281 --> 03:13:03,620
means your military maps are all 
different.

3328
03:13:03,980 --> 03:13:08,980
The place that the hammer blow in 
nibbles offensive was going to fall is 

3329
03:13:08,980 --> 03:13:11,360
the place Luton Dorf just vacated.
Okay,

3330
03:13:11,361 --> 03:13:14,840
so as Ludina are probably intended,
you got to change your plans,

3331
03:13:14,841 --> 03:13:18,650
don't you mean conditions on the ground?
That changed and evolved said,

3332
03:13:18,651 --> 03:13:23,651
I don't have to change my plans.
This all helps my goal and this is where

3333
03:13:23,991 --> 03:13:26,240
everything starts to fall apart in this 
plan,

3334
03:13:26,450 --> 03:13:31,450
and yet at the same time you can see how
these are such huge affairs involving so

3335
03:13:32,631 --> 03:13:37,631
many months of preparation,
so much momentum that even if you find 

3336
03:13:37,631 --> 03:13:41,240
out near the beginning of the of the 
battle that things have changed.

3337
03:13:41,840 --> 03:13:44,150
There's a momentum that you can't really
even stop.

3338
03:13:44,151 --> 03:13:45,590
In this case,
everything starts going wrong.

3339
03:13:45,591 --> 03:13:47,510
For interval before the whole battle 
starts,

3340
03:13:48,790 --> 03:13:53,790
nonetheless,
before knievel's part of the battle 

3341
03:13:53,790 --> 03:13:55,561
starts the campaign that sort of a 
diversionary campaign designed to make 

3342
03:13:56,891 --> 03:14:01,030
the Germans move away from where the is 
going to attack starts.

3343
03:14:01,060 --> 03:14:06,060
That's the part of this campaign that 
involves the British and the dominion 

3344
03:14:06,131 --> 03:14:07,570
forces.
It happens,

3345
03:14:07,890 --> 03:14:12,890
um,
next to the French position at a place 

3346
03:14:12,890 --> 03:14:14,821
called Rs.
And at this battle for at least a few 

3347
03:14:16,580 --> 03:14:21,580
days,
everyone gets a chance to see exactly 

3348
03:14:21,580 --> 03:14:25,451
how you would go about striking defenses
as invincible as the Germans.

3349
03:14:26,270 --> 03:14:29,600
And it looks a lot like world war two.

3350
03:14:31,940 --> 03:14:33,860
And you know,
several historians have pointed out that

3351
03:14:33,861 --> 03:14:38,861
by the end of the first world war,
the armies are prodo second world war 

3352
03:14:38,861 --> 03:14:42,581
armies.
There are certain battles though during 

3353
03:14:42,581 --> 03:14:42,581
the war where you can say,
Aha,

3354
03:14:42,581 --> 03:14:47,240
there is a big step forward towards that
Second World War 20th century style of 

3355
03:14:48,621 --> 03:14:53,621
fighting.
That's what the battle of Eros is known 

3356
03:14:53,621 --> 03:14:53,621
for.
Now,

3357
03:14:53,621 --> 03:14:54,050
in the grand scheme of things,
as we said,

3358
03:14:54,140 --> 03:14:57,170
this is the spring offensive.
This is what the allies do every year,

3359
03:14:57,171 --> 03:15:02,171
right?
The weather gets good and spring we 

3360
03:15:02,171 --> 03:15:04,091
launched an offensive,
the British and the French launch one 

3361
03:15:04,091 --> 03:15:04,091
together,
or they launched one in tandem.

3362
03:15:04,091 --> 03:15:04,820
The Italians do,
as we said,

3363
03:15:04,880 --> 03:15:06,350
I mean they launch them everywhere.
The Russians.

3364
03:15:06,530 --> 03:15:11,530
This is the big spring offensive.
The British part is these sort of 

3365
03:15:11,530 --> 03:15:14,801
diversion as we said,
and yet they're going to pull this off 

3366
03:15:14,801 --> 03:15:18,550
initially so well.
They're going to show everyone what 20th

3367
03:15:19,071 --> 03:15:21,410
century combined arms warfare looks 
like,

3368
03:15:21,411 --> 03:15:26,411
including aircraft.
The amount of coordination though that 

3369
03:15:26,411 --> 03:15:29,681
has to come off correctly to make this 
work is stunning and it can't be 

3370
03:15:29,681 --> 03:15:31,580
maintained,
but for the short period of time they're

3371
03:15:31,581 --> 03:15:36,581
able to make it work.
The British show you that modern 

3372
03:15:36,581 --> 03:15:40,250
combined arms warfare can devastate 
these static defenses.

3373
03:15:42,110 --> 03:15:47,110
Here's the way historian Peter Harte 
describes the many things that were 

3374
03:15:47,110 --> 03:15:49,410
starting to come together that could be 
unleashed at Eros and how scientific and

3375
03:15:49,411 --> 03:15:50,250
modern 20th

3376
03:15:50,250 --> 03:15:53,940
century this profession of arms is 
really becoming.

3377
03:15:54,420 --> 03:15:55,230
He writes,
quote,

3378
03:15:57,180 --> 03:15:59,250
many lessons had been learned from the 
Psalm,

3379
03:15:59,430 --> 03:16:03,440
and artillery was at the heart of the 
plans and the royal artillery had come a

3380
03:16:03,441 --> 03:16:08,441
long way since 1915.
The thousands upon thousands of new 

3381
03:16:08,441 --> 03:16:10,770
recruits had learned their trade well.
That gun detachments,

3382
03:16:10,860 --> 03:16:15,860
the layers the NCO is the officers were 
all now wedded into efficient batteries 

3383
03:16:15,860 --> 03:16:19,710
that were capable of increasingly 
sophisticated and complex bombardments.

3384
03:16:20,040 --> 03:16:25,040
The guns themselves were now plentiful 
and there were vast numbers of medium 

3385
03:16:25,040 --> 03:16:28,641
and heavy artillery pieces joining the 
masses of ordinary 18 pounder and four 

3386
03:16:28,641 --> 03:16:29,790
and a half inch,
how it's your field,

3387
03:16:29,791 --> 03:16:34,791
artillery advances in technology and 
science also combined to give a greater 

3388
03:16:34,791 --> 03:16:39,441
understanding of the mechanics of a 
shell in flight and the measurable 

3389
03:16:39,441 --> 03:16:43,071
adjustments caused by different media.
A logical conditions accuracy was 

3390
03:16:43,071 --> 03:16:46,290
improving and the advent of the 
[inaudible] fuse meant that shells would

3391
03:16:46,291 --> 03:16:49,020
burst instantaneously on the slightest 
contact,

3392
03:16:49,200 --> 03:16:51,370
which made clearing barbed wire and 
great deal.

3393
03:16:51,380 --> 03:16:55,980
Simpler smoke shells were also now 
routinely incorporated into the barrages

3394
03:16:56,130 --> 03:16:59,250
to try to mask the attacking infantry 
from German defenders.

3395
03:16:59,490 --> 03:17:04,490
Gas shells were a key part of the 
barrages and they were less visually 

3396
03:17:04,490 --> 03:17:05,940
dramatic than the clouds of gas released
from cylinders,

3397
03:17:06,120 --> 03:17:09,900
but they were far easier to deploy and 
much more predictable in their effects.

3398
03:17:10,200 --> 03:17:15,200
Progress in the linked tasks.
A photographic reconnaissance and 

3399
03:17:15,200 --> 03:17:18,891
artillery observation allowed targets to
be identified and then destroyed by 

3400
03:17:18,891 --> 03:17:20,130
indirect fire.
New techniques,

3401
03:17:20,131 --> 03:17:25,080
a flash spotting and sound ranging also 
assisted in locating the exact positions

3402
03:17:25,081 --> 03:17:30,081
of German batteries and the amount of 
coordination that has to come off 

3403
03:17:30,241 --> 03:17:35,241
correctly to make this stuff work is 
astounding and it shouldn't be 

3404
03:17:35,241 --> 03:17:38,721
surprising that it usually doesn't.
What makes her us different is that in 

3405
03:17:38,721 --> 03:17:41,070
some cases it did at the battle of Rs.
Take for example,

3406
03:17:41,400 --> 03:17:46,400
the creeping barrage,
the creeping barrage is a fantastic 

3407
03:17:46,400 --> 03:17:50,750
military innovation and they'd been 
trying to make it work before this 

3408
03:17:50,750 --> 03:17:51,180
battle in this battle.

3409
03:17:51,180 --> 03:17:56,180
They got it right in this battle.
They were able for a while to create a 

3410
03:17:56,180 --> 03:18:00,240
protective explosive force field around 
British troops.

3411
03:18:01,260 --> 03:18:04,890
The way it worked is you would get a ton
of guns anywhere from several hundred to

3412
03:18:04,891 --> 03:18:09,891
more than a thousand firing giant cannon
aids in front of your advancing forces,

3413
03:18:12,390 --> 03:18:17,390
creating a wall of explosions in front 
of them and you would have it 

3414
03:18:17,390 --> 03:18:21,531
coordinated.
Everybody would have their watch is 

3415
03:18:21,531 --> 03:18:21,531
synchronized and the troops would be 
told,

3416
03:18:21,531 --> 03:18:25,731
okay,
in the first 20 minutes you were to 

3417
03:18:25,731 --> 03:18:25,731
move,
you know,

3418
03:18:25,731 --> 03:18:28,590
100 yards forward and at this time the 
barrage will shift another hundred yards

3419
03:18:28,591 --> 03:18:33,591
in front of you.
So this was all worked out so that you 

3420
03:18:33,591 --> 03:18:34,440
know the protective barraged supposed to
keep the troops safe as the,

3421
03:18:34,500 --> 03:18:39,500
as they advance toward the enemy.
And the very last step of course is the 

3422
03:18:39,500 --> 03:18:42,120
barrage will land right on the enemy and
then it will lift at the last second and

3423
03:18:42,121 --> 03:18:47,121
the enemy will look up and the British 
forces will be right there standing in 

3424
03:18:47,121 --> 03:18:50,121
front of them.
Having marched the whole with a giant 

3425
03:18:50,121 --> 03:18:50,121
explosive force field,
protecting them.

3426
03:18:50,770 --> 03:18:53,350
As you might imagine,
coordination is critical.

3427
03:18:53,500 --> 03:18:56,140
You screwed this up in one of two things
happens.

3428
03:18:56,560 --> 03:19:00,250
The better thing is that the barrage 
gets way ahead of the troops and they're

3429
03:19:00,251 --> 03:19:05,251
exposed to all the machine gunfire and 
all the stuff that barrage was supposed 

3430
03:19:05,251 --> 03:19:05,380
to protect them from.
That's the good part.

3431
03:19:05,410 --> 03:19:10,410
That's the best outcome.
The worst outcome is that the barrage 

3432
03:19:10,410 --> 03:19:13,620
short and that giant explosive wall 
that's supposed to protect you from the 

3433
03:19:13,620 --> 03:19:14,590
enemy instead decimates you.

3434
03:19:15,830 --> 03:19:18,260
When it works,
it's fantastic.

3435
03:19:18,530 --> 03:19:20,030
At the battle of our us,
it works.

3436
03:19:20,120 --> 03:19:20,810
Initially,

3437
03:19:22,970 --> 03:19:25,040
there'll be a bunch of innovations at 
this battle.

3438
03:19:25,250 --> 03:19:30,250
Another one,
again that has been tried before but 

3439
03:19:30,250 --> 03:19:32,561
never quite like this,
as whole batteries have machine guns 

3440
03:19:32,561 --> 03:19:33,500
will be used in what's called indirect 
fire,

3441
03:19:33,501 --> 03:19:37,700
meaning they point them up to the sky so
that the bullets ended up falling.

3442
03:19:37,980 --> 03:19:38,780
You know?
Right.

3443
03:19:38,781 --> 03:19:41,780
Straight down on targets.
You could shoot over hills that way.

3444
03:19:41,930 --> 03:19:43,970
Not even seeing what you're shooting at 
is one.

3445
03:19:43,990 --> 03:19:48,410
A historian explained it.
It's like hosing down an important piece

3446
03:19:48,411 --> 03:19:53,411
of ground and they would have thousands 
of machine gun bullets falling every 

3447
03:19:53,411 --> 03:19:55,190
second on some of these important road 
crossings and whatnot.

3448
03:19:55,430 --> 03:19:56,540
All through this battle.

3449
03:19:58,070 --> 03:20:03,070
One of the important elements at the 
start of the battle is that so many of 

3450
03:20:03,070 --> 03:20:04,910
the troops that are going to initially 
rush the German side,

3451
03:20:05,060 --> 03:20:07,040
our underground at the start of the 
battle,

3452
03:20:07,041 --> 03:20:12,041
there's a lot of chalky ground in this 
part of France and like a lot of these 

3453
03:20:12,041 --> 03:20:12,710
battles,
there will be a ton of digging.

3454
03:20:13,070 --> 03:20:18,070
In fact,
four months the Germans and the British 

3455
03:20:18,070 --> 03:20:19,190
on both sides have had sort of a 
tunneling war and occasionally,

3456
03:20:19,420 --> 03:20:24,420
you know,
British tunnels toward the German front 

3457
03:20:24,420 --> 03:20:26,830
run into German tunnelers going the 
other way and they had these terrible 

3458
03:20:26,830 --> 03:20:27,140
gun fights in the dark under ground.
You know,

3459
03:20:27,141 --> 03:20:28,610
like troglodyte fighting.

3460
03:20:30,800 --> 03:20:34,160
Some sources say that.
The moment the actual ground battle at a

3461
03:20:34,170 --> 03:20:39,170
Ross started,
some of these tunnels had gone up all 

3462
03:20:39,170 --> 03:20:40,250
the way to the German lines,
but just a couple of feet separated them

3463
03:20:40,610 --> 03:20:43,940
from the German trench lines and that at
the second the battle started.

3464
03:20:43,941 --> 03:20:45,830
They exploded.
Charges in those,

3465
03:20:45,950 --> 03:20:48,860
those little walls of dirt blew down.
And the Canadians,

3466
03:20:48,980 --> 03:20:50,480
you know,
storm through the breaches.

3467
03:20:50,481 --> 03:20:55,481
It doesn't matter what exactly happened.
The Canadian storm wme Ridge now and 

3468
03:20:55,851 --> 03:21:00,851
took it on the first day,
a ridge that untold numbers of Frenchman

3469
03:21:01,071 --> 03:21:06,071
had died trying to take back in 1915.
It's a huge Canadian victory and the 

3470
03:21:07,281 --> 03:21:11,840
Germans were in terrible trouble for a 
short while at the battle of ours.

3471
03:21:11,900 --> 03:21:13,670
And by the way,
it's not just Canadians.

3472
03:21:13,671 --> 03:21:15,650
They get a lot of credit and deservedly 
so,

3473
03:21:15,920 --> 03:21:17,600
but there were Scotsman,
for example,

3474
03:21:17,601 --> 03:21:21,020
up on the same hill.
I'm dealing with all kinds of problems.

3475
03:21:21,730 --> 03:21:21,960
Okay,

3476
03:21:22,140 --> 03:21:27,140
and yet for the first 24 hours,
it looked like Douglas Haig,

3477
03:21:27,181 --> 03:21:31,350
the British commander was going to have 
on his hands the long awaited,

3478
03:21:31,351 --> 03:21:34,260
much fantasized about in his head 
breakthrough

3479
03:21:37,310 --> 03:21:42,310
Ludin Dorf writes in his diaries that he
was a a dangerous moment and then and 

3480
03:21:42,310 --> 03:21:46,010
then lamented the fact that here this 
brand new defense in system he'd come up

3481
03:21:46,011 --> 03:21:51,011
with,
with all this work and all this money 

3482
03:21:51,011 --> 03:21:51,740
spent was apparently useless against 
these new British combined arms tactics.

3483
03:21:52,040 --> 03:21:55,160
That was until he figured out that his 
commander on the scene,

3484
03:21:55,161 --> 03:21:58,370
a guy named Falcon House and a 70 
something year old guy,

3485
03:21:58,700 --> 03:22:03,500
hadn't quite figured out what he was 
supposed to do with these new tactics.

3486
03:22:03,501 --> 03:22:07,190
They were still way too new and he had 
done a bunch of things that were part of

3487
03:22:07,191 --> 03:22:12,191
the old tactics.
He put all his guys for the most part 

3488
03:22:12,191 --> 03:22:14,801
way up front where they could be taken 
by the artillery more than two and a 

3489
03:22:14,871 --> 03:22:19,871
half million British shells by the way,
fired a in a shorter time than the 

3490
03:22:19,871 --> 03:22:24,821
battle of the somme,
and then he put his reserves that are 

3491
03:22:24,821 --> 03:22:28,451
supposed to be there to plug any holes 
15 miles back too far to do anything in 

3492
03:22:28,451 --> 03:22:28,760
for a short period of time.

3493
03:22:28,970 --> 03:22:33,970
It looked like the British were going to
break through at this battle and then 

3494
03:22:33,970 --> 03:22:37,730
just like all these other battles,
it slows down.

3495
03:22:38,090 --> 03:22:41,930
Once the troops advanced beyond where 
they're gunfire can help them,

3496
03:22:42,140 --> 03:22:47,140
then the guns behind them have to move 
to and that takes time and everybody 

3497
03:22:47,140 --> 03:22:51,821
gets tired and they begin to wear out 
and while they're resting and 

3498
03:22:51,821 --> 03:22:52,610
rejuvenating themselves for the next 
push,

3499
03:22:52,760 --> 03:22:57,760
the Germans are bringing up their 
reserves and the battle of Arras with 

3500
03:22:57,760 --> 03:23:01,361
this wonderful first day in this capture
of this important vimy ridge turns into 

3501
03:23:01,361 --> 03:23:04,670
just another one of these battles.
And by the time it's over,

3502
03:23:04,790 --> 03:23:09,110
more than a month later,
you have like 150,000

3503
03:23:09,111 --> 03:23:12,320
British casualties and like 130,000
German ones.

3504
03:23:12,321 --> 03:23:17,321
And by the way,
I found it interesting that the newer 

3505
03:23:17,321 --> 03:23:17,321
histories,
numbers of the casualties,

3506
03:23:17,321 --> 03:23:19,070
these battles is significantly higher 
than the older ones.

3507
03:23:19,430 --> 03:23:22,910
I have some that say that 75,000
British died at this battle.

3508
03:23:23,120 --> 03:23:25,670
That's a big discrepancy in the numbers.
Nonetheless,

3509
03:23:25,910 --> 03:23:29,090
the traditional numbers thrown out today
are well over 100,000

3510
03:23:29,091 --> 03:23:30,770
for both sides.
Um,

3511
03:23:30,810 --> 03:23:34,850
the,
the joy over vinny was short lived.

3512
03:23:35,840 --> 03:23:40,840
And what had happened at this battle 
would happen at a bunch of other first 

3513
03:23:40,840 --> 03:23:42,290
world war battles.
It shows the difference between how well

3514
03:23:42,440 --> 03:23:45,080
the first stage,
usually the first 24,

3515
03:23:45,081 --> 03:23:50,081
maybe 36 hours of these minute Lee 
exquisitely planned encounters go the 

3516
03:23:50,081 --> 03:23:55,001
part that's all been rehearsed and 
trained for for months and months and 

3517
03:23:55,001 --> 03:23:57,260
months goes great and you're able to 
make the coordination work,

3518
03:23:57,650 --> 03:24:02,650
but then the next jump in wherever you 
are in these battles is the part that 

3519
03:24:02,650 --> 03:24:04,880
becomes much more improvisational,
much more ad hoc.

3520
03:24:05,000 --> 03:24:10,000
You can't have a plan,
you know months in advance for what you 

3521
03:24:10,000 --> 03:24:13,751
do on the second day of the battle 
because you're not really sure where 

3522
03:24:13,751 --> 03:24:13,751
you're going to be the second day.

3523
03:24:13,751 --> 03:24:15,920
You may have some,
but that doesn't mean that's what you're

3524
03:24:15,921 --> 03:24:18,110
going to do and and as many historians 
point out,

3525
03:24:18,111 --> 03:24:20,990
when you look at the next jumps in any 
of these offensive,

3526
03:24:20,991 --> 03:24:25,991
they are so much more haphazard and all 
that coordination falls apart that you 

3527
03:24:25,991 --> 03:24:30,131
don't see the wonderful results that 
that months of preparation gave you for 

3528
03:24:30,131 --> 03:24:34,721
24 or 36 hours.
And yet you can't break through these 

3529
03:24:34,721 --> 03:24:37,220
kinds of deep defenses in that short of 
a period of time.

3530
03:24:37,221 --> 03:24:41,780
You would have to have that combined 
arms activity work as well as it did for

3531
03:24:41,781 --> 03:24:46,200
the first 24 hours at a Ross and be able
to carry it through for a week or two.

3532
03:24:47,190 --> 03:24:48,990
Nevertheless,
it was a near run thing.

3533
03:24:49,230 --> 03:24:51,090
It's gone down in history as a,
as a,

3534
03:24:51,240 --> 03:24:53,640
as a heroic encounter.
Mostly for the Canadians,

3535
03:24:53,641 --> 03:24:56,970
the largest endeavor they participated 
in yet on the western front,

3536
03:24:57,950 --> 03:25:00,180
and I always have to remind myself,
you know,

3537
03:25:00,181 --> 03:25:04,200
you look at this in an almost a field 
marshal type fashion.

3538
03:25:04,200 --> 03:25:05,700
When you study this for military 
history,

3539
03:25:05,701 --> 03:25:08,700
you see it the way the generals often 
did these advancements on these maps.

3540
03:25:08,701 --> 03:25:13,701
What worked and what didn't.
You know the coordination question that 

3541
03:25:13,701 --> 03:25:13,980
the technical side of war.
You always have to remember though,

3542
03:25:13,981 --> 03:25:16,740
and I always try to remind myself to the
people on the ground.

3543
03:25:16,741 --> 03:25:20,790
This is not so technical.
Philip Gibbs was there.

3544
03:25:21,450 --> 03:25:26,450
He was in the tunnels with the troops as
they came back from these encounters up 

3545
03:25:28,081 --> 03:25:33,081
on vimeo ridge and places like that.
Gibbs gives you a real feel for what it 

3546
03:25:33,081 --> 03:25:33,750
was like.
He writes,

3547
03:25:33,751 --> 03:25:38,751
quote,
there were tunnels beneath Ross through 

3548
03:25:38,751 --> 03:25:39,570
which are men advanced to the German 
lines,

3549
03:25:39,810 --> 03:25:44,810
and I went along them when one line of 
men was going into battle and another 

3550
03:25:44,810 --> 03:25:48,621
was coming back wounded,
some of them blind bloody vomiting with 

3551
03:25:48,621 --> 03:25:53,070
the fumes of gas in their lungs.
Their steel hats clinking as they groped

3552
03:25:53,071 --> 03:25:54,180
past one another.

3553
03:25:54,480 --> 03:25:59,280
Involves on each side of these passages.
Men played cards on barrels to the light

3554
03:25:59,281 --> 03:26:04,281
of candles,
stuck in bottles or slept until their 

3555
03:26:04,281 --> 03:26:05,310
turn to fight with gas masks for their 
pillows.

3556
03:26:06,870 --> 03:26:09,390
He says outside the citadel,
meaning of the city.

3557
03:26:09,900 --> 03:26:14,900
There were long queues of wounded men 
taking their turn to the surgeons who 

3558
03:26:14,900 --> 03:26:17,940
were working in a deep crypt with a high
vaulted roof.

3559
03:26:18,180 --> 03:26:21,810
One day there were 3000 of them.
Silent patient,

3560
03:26:21,960 --> 03:26:26,490
muddy bloodstained,
blind boys or men with smashed faces,

3561
03:26:26,491 --> 03:26:31,491
swapped in bloody rags,
groped forward to the dark passages 

3562
03:26:31,491 --> 03:26:34,080
leading to the vault,
led by comrades on the grass outside lay

3563
03:26:34,081 --> 03:26:37,290
men with leg wounds and stomach wounds.
And the quote,

3564
03:26:38,760 --> 03:26:43,560
Norman Collins is an officer with the 
Scottish fourth seaforth highlanders,

3565
03:26:43,561 --> 03:26:48,561
and they're there to.
And Collins just tells these stories 

3566
03:26:48,561 --> 03:26:52,911
that reminds you of the very strange 
moral positions,

3567
03:26:53,281 --> 03:26:55,500
these kinds of conflicts puts you in.

3568
03:26:55,920 --> 03:27:00,920
Collins talks about the fact that they 
were actually shown how to kill one of 

3569
03:27:02,671 --> 03:27:07,410
their own men on the battlefield because
of the pain and suffering that they were

3570
03:27:07,411 --> 03:27:11,010
enduring.
And this isn't specific to this battle,

3571
03:27:11,220 --> 03:27:16,220
this happened on the battlefields 
throughout the first world war in 

3572
03:27:16,220 --> 03:27:18,570
basically every army you know that got 
caught in these conditions.

3573
03:27:18,571 --> 03:27:23,571
These are human problems,
the physics of humankind on these 20th 

3574
03:27:23,571 --> 03:27:25,290
century battlefields.
The results are predictable,

3575
03:27:25,620 --> 03:27:30,620
horrifying,
and pitiable collins writes,

3576
03:27:30,990 --> 03:27:33,600
quote,
after such intense fighting,

3577
03:27:33,601 --> 03:27:36,300
you always had men lying out in no man's
land,

3578
03:27:36,540 --> 03:27:40,350
probably with their testicles blown off 
and crying in agony and laying out there

3579
03:27:40,351 --> 03:27:42,430
all night long in the dark,
in the rain,

3580
03:27:42,790 --> 03:27:45,880
most would never have survived,
but you had a choice.

3581
03:27:46,120 --> 03:27:48,760
They could die in agony or you could 
shoot them.

3582
03:27:49,150 --> 03:27:51,430
You were shown how to do the thing very 
cleanly.

3583
03:27:51,520 --> 03:27:56,520
You would take your 45 revolver and talk
to the man and kneel behind him and 

3584
03:27:56,591 --> 03:27:58,750
whilst you were talking,
pulled the trigger,

3585
03:27:59,050 --> 03:28:04,050
put a bullet through the back of his 
head and immediately the whole front 

3586
03:28:04,050 --> 03:28:04,210
skull came away and they were dead 
instantly.

3587
03:28:04,390 --> 03:28:07,270
There was no pain about it,
but I can honestly say this,

3588
03:28:07,540 --> 03:28:10,060
that I never had the courage because 
that's what it took.

3589
03:28:10,330 --> 03:28:13,270
I never had the courage myself to shoot 
a wounded soldier.

3590
03:28:13,480 --> 03:28:16,750
I carried out the operation many times 
afterwards on animals.

3591
03:28:16,990 --> 03:28:19,630
I could kill a pet dog far better than a
vet could,

3592
03:28:19,840 --> 03:28:22,120
but I was never able to shoot a wounded 
soldier.

3593
03:28:22,330 --> 03:28:24,730
I probably should have.
My friend auto,

3594
03:28:24,731 --> 03:28:28,480
Murray Dixon was wounded in the stomach 
and the irs attack in April.

3595
03:28:28,660 --> 03:28:30,910
He was in great agony from what I was 
told.

3596
03:28:31,120 --> 03:28:33,880
The kindest thing would've been to shoot
him on the battlefield.

3597
03:28:34,090 --> 03:28:39,090
Instead of that,
they took him back to the hospital and 

3598
03:28:39,090 --> 03:28:41,251
he died two days later.
It's a tremendous thing to shoot a 

3599
03:28:41,251 --> 03:28:43,240
friend even though he's in agony and I 
just didn't have the courage to do it.

3600
03:28:43,600 --> 03:28:45,880
Most of them died overnight,
but of course they didn't.

3601
03:28:45,881 --> 03:28:48,560
Thank you for it.
I'm sure the quote,

3602
03:28:50,850 --> 03:28:55,850
there are battles coming up with the 
numbers of people who were either shot 

3603
03:28:56,041 --> 03:29:01,041
by their own men or begged to be will 
skyrocket.

3604
03:29:02,850 --> 03:29:06,060
Nonetheless,
this battle was tough enough.

3605
03:29:06,990 --> 03:29:11,990
The initial stages of elation at taking 
things like Vimeo Ridge became

3606
03:29:13,700 --> 03:29:18,700
nightmarish.
As the month went on and the casualties 

3607
03:29:18,700 --> 03:29:22,751
piled up before long,
the British were suffering for thousand 

3608
03:29:22,751 --> 03:29:26,801
casualties a day at a Ross and it was 
getting to the morale of the troops.

3609
03:29:27,860 --> 03:29:32,860
Gibbs tells a story about arriving on a 
scene right after a bunch of men just 

3610
03:29:32,860 --> 03:29:37,661
behind the front had been blown up in 
their bath together and the bath is 

3611
03:29:37,661 --> 03:29:41,510
strewn with body parts and blood and he 
and a soldier he knows sits down to talk

3612
03:29:41,511 --> 03:29:46,040
about you know how things are going,
and the soldier is clearly at the end of

3613
03:29:46,041 --> 03:29:48,350
his rope as far as what he's willing to 
put up with.

3614
03:29:49,190 --> 03:29:49,910
He writes,
quote,

3615
03:29:50,480 --> 03:29:54,590
a few minutes before our meeting,
a shell had crashed into a bath close to

3616
03:29:54,591 --> 03:29:56,690
their hut where men were watching 
themselves.

3617
03:29:56,930 --> 03:30:00,020
The explosion filled the bath with blood
and bits of flesh.

3618
03:30:00,260 --> 03:30:05,260
The younger officers stared at me under 
the tilt forward of his steel hat and 

3619
03:30:05,260 --> 03:30:05,510
said,
hello gibbs.

3620
03:30:05,810 --> 03:30:09,890
I'd played chess with him at grooms cafe
in fleet street in days before the war.

3621
03:30:10,160 --> 03:30:13,520
I went back to his hut and had tea with 
him close to that bath,

3622
03:30:13,730 --> 03:30:17,840
hoping we should not get caught up with 
the cake and quote.

3623
03:30:19,460 --> 03:30:20,720
Now,
this battle,

3624
03:30:20,721 --> 03:30:25,721
as I said,
is known for how wonderfully competent 

3625
03:30:25,721 --> 03:30:29,350
the integration of all the different 
elements were to make this battle so 

3626
03:30:29,350 --> 03:30:32,921
effective.
That's not how the guy on the ground 

3627
03:30:32,921 --> 03:30:35,171
sees it.
Though Gibbs says that his friend he's 

3628
03:30:35,171 --> 03:30:37,490
having tea with says quote.
I had heard before,

3629
03:30:37,491 --> 03:30:40,250
some harsh words about our general staff
work,

3630
03:30:40,550 --> 03:30:43,250
but never anything so passionate,
so violent,

3631
03:30:43,251 --> 03:30:48,251
is from that gunner officer.
His view of the business was summed up 

3632
03:30:48,251 --> 03:30:51,641
in the word murder.
He raged against the impossible orders 

3633
03:30:51,641 --> 03:30:55,541
sent down from headquarters against the 
brutality with which men were left in 

3634
03:30:55,541 --> 03:30:59,270
the line week after week and against the
monstrous abominable futility of all our

3635
03:30:59,271 --> 03:31:02,600
so called strategy.
His nerves were in rags,

3636
03:31:02,601 --> 03:31:04,580
as I could see,
by the way in which his hands shook.

3637
03:31:04,760 --> 03:31:06,830
When he lighted one cigarette after 
another,

3638
03:31:07,070 --> 03:31:11,300
his spirit was in a flame of revolt 
against the misery of his sleeplessness,

3639
03:31:11,480 --> 03:31:15,950
filth and imminent peril of death and 
quote.

3640
03:31:18,370 --> 03:31:23,370
If British reporter Philip Gibbs thinks 
that that's a high level of discontent 

3641
03:31:23,370 --> 03:31:25,210
and perhaps in the British army,
it is.

3642
03:31:25,930 --> 03:31:29,650
You ought to see what's going on in the 
French army at about the same time

3643
03:31:31,780 --> 03:31:36,780
in France,
a great drama is unfolding during this 

3644
03:31:36,780 --> 03:31:39,490
time period because right before these 
offensives are scheduled to start,

3645
03:31:40,000 --> 03:31:45,000
the French government falls and new 
political leaders take over a new 

3646
03:31:45,000 --> 03:31:45,880
president,
a new war minister.

3647
03:31:45,881 --> 03:31:50,881
All these civilian leaders have changed 
and these civilian leaders have a very 

3648
03:31:50,881 --> 03:31:53,110
different attitude towards this 
offensive that's about to start than the

3649
03:31:53,111 --> 03:31:56,470
people they succeeded.
This causes huge problems.

3650
03:31:56,471 --> 03:31:58,690
The first thing is,
they're not big fans of novel,

3651
03:31:59,320 --> 03:32:04,320
but join the club.
There are lots of people who wonder why 

3652
03:32:04,320 --> 03:32:04,320
this guy got the top job when there were
several,

3653
03:32:04,560 --> 03:32:06,100
you know,
superior figures,

3654
03:32:06,101 --> 03:32:08,580
really August people who could have 
gotten it.

3655
03:32:08,600 --> 03:32:12,100
Potassium follow people like that were 
sitting in the wings and they gave it to

3656
03:32:12,101 --> 03:32:14,350
a much more junior person,
but,

3657
03:32:14,380 --> 03:32:19,380
but for political reasons,
I mean he fit that last government in 

3658
03:32:19,380 --> 03:32:19,690
ways that were good for that last 
government,

3659
03:32:19,691 --> 03:32:24,691
but now that last government was gone 
and the new one that comes into power 

3660
03:32:24,691 --> 03:32:25,420
would've rather had any one of those 
other people.

3661
03:32:26,680 --> 03:32:28,330
What's more,
they don't like his plan,

3662
03:32:28,990 --> 03:32:33,990
his idea for this great thunderbolts 
assault with all this artillery that's 

3663
03:32:33,990 --> 03:32:34,930
going to end the war in 48 hours.
They're not buying it.

3664
03:32:35,540 --> 03:32:36,740
A lot of people are,
by the way,

3665
03:32:36,741 --> 03:32:41,741
a lot of people are drinking the Robert 
Nouvelle Koolaid and getting into this 

3666
03:32:41,741 --> 03:32:44,560
optimistic mood about this thunderbolt 
ending the war,

3667
03:32:45,850 --> 03:32:50,850
but the new government's pretty sure 
that that's not what's going to happen 

3668
03:32:50,850 --> 03:32:53,010
and they've got some people who ought to
know sending the message.

3669
03:32:53,011 --> 03:32:58,011
Just warning them.
There are other military commanders in 

3670
03:32:58,011 --> 03:32:58,390
France who are saying,
call this thing off.

3671
03:32:58,570 --> 03:33:02,410
It's going to be a disaster.
Some of them are people who are actually

3672
03:33:02,411 --> 03:33:07,411
subordinate to Nevada and who have jobs 
to do in this coming offensive that 

3673
03:33:08,901 --> 03:33:11,200
scaring the government.
As you might imagine,

3674
03:33:13,380 --> 03:33:18,380
this is all part of this growing 
interference with politicians in the 

3675
03:33:18,691 --> 03:33:23,691
affairs of generals and this is one of 
those times where there sort of a face 

3676
03:33:23,691 --> 03:33:27,591
off I'm eating is called between the new
war minister and novel in late March and

3677
03:33:29,071 --> 03:33:34,071
the new war minister wants to convince 
devel to call this whole offensive off 

3678
03:33:34,071 --> 03:33:35,370
and they're almost impossible thing to 
do.

3679
03:33:35,371 --> 03:33:40,371
As we said earlier,
by the time you reach stages where 

3680
03:33:40,371 --> 03:33:41,550
you're just finishing the last touches 
ready to go.

3681
03:33:41,551 --> 03:33:46,551
It's taken months and months and the 
training and the rehearsals and the 

3682
03:33:46,551 --> 03:33:46,650
money spent and all this stuff,
and now the government,

3683
03:33:46,651 --> 03:33:48,980
the civilian leaders who don't know 
anything about war,

3684
03:33:49,320 --> 03:33:51,990
any general would think want to call it 
off.

3685
03:33:52,230 --> 03:33:55,500
My reputation relies on this.
I mean there's a lot of personal motives

3686
03:33:55,890 --> 03:33:58,680
and the war minister has some good 
arguments.

3687
03:33:59,880 --> 03:34:01,080
He tries to tell him,
look,

3688
03:34:01,470 --> 03:34:04,470
everything's changed since you first 
formulated this plan.

3689
03:34:04,471 --> 03:34:07,530
When did just be prudent to reevaluate?

3690
03:34:09,420 --> 03:34:14,420
I mean,
the Germans pulled back from their old 

3691
03:34:14,420 --> 03:34:15,420
positions to these new positions on the 
siegfried line and other places,

3692
03:34:15,421 --> 03:34:17,400
right?
There's one big change,

3693
03:34:18,000 --> 03:34:23,000
but not just that the war minister tries
to make the case that all of these big 

3694
03:34:23,000 --> 03:34:25,350
events are happening right now.
These trends coming together,

3695
03:34:25,351 --> 03:34:30,351
everything we've talked about on this 
program up to date are coming to the 

3696
03:34:30,991 --> 03:34:35,991
fore at the same time in late March when
the war minister is talking to novel 

3697
03:34:36,310 --> 03:34:41,310
about this,
the United States is just about to get 

3698
03:34:41,310 --> 03:34:43,911
in the war and everyone knows it.
The Russian revolution has just 

3699
03:34:43,911 --> 03:34:47,541
happened.
The submarines are about to enter into 

3700
03:34:47,541 --> 03:34:49,380
the month where they sink.
Eight hundred and 40,000

3701
03:34:49,381 --> 03:34:54,381
tons of allied shipping.
There's a lot going on and Francis warm 

3702
03:34:54,381 --> 03:34:55,980
minister tries to tell Nevada lit,
listen,

3703
03:34:56,280 --> 03:34:57,420
no one's going to hold you.
I mean,

3704
03:34:57,510 --> 03:34:59,450
everything's changed.
Maybe we should reevaluate.

3705
03:34:59,460 --> 03:35:00,510
Novel says,
no.

3706
03:35:02,100 --> 03:35:07,100
The government gets even more desperate 
as the offensive nears and presses him 

3707
03:35:07,921 --> 03:35:12,600
and he pulls the takeaway card.
He says to the government,

3708
03:35:12,601 --> 03:35:14,730
either you back me on this or I 
resigned,

3709
03:35:16,290 --> 03:35:19,380
and everything I've read says that this 
is a crisis for the French government at

3710
03:35:19,381 --> 03:35:21,330
this point for all sorts of internal 
reasons.

3711
03:35:21,660 --> 03:35:26,660
It was likely to bring the government 
down if they fired novell right before 

3712
03:35:26,660 --> 03:35:30,531
his offensive was supposed to take hold 
and everyone had bought into the 

3713
03:35:30,531 --> 03:35:33,291
optimism and drank the Koolaid.
They had almost no choice in this 

3714
03:35:33,291 --> 03:35:34,920
confrontation between politicians and 
generals and the government backed down,

3715
03:35:35,460 --> 03:35:39,720
but it was even worse than the 
government knew because the Germans knew

3716
03:35:39,840 --> 03:35:44,840
all about novels,
plans in detail to major incidents.

3717
03:35:45,710 --> 03:35:50,710
Uh,
one involving captured documents that 

3718
03:35:50,710 --> 03:35:52,851
never should have been anywhere near the
front lines that the Germans got their 

3719
03:35:52,851 --> 03:35:52,851
hands on in a,
in a raid,

3720
03:35:52,851 --> 03:35:54,390
and then an officer that they captured.

3721
03:35:54,390 --> 03:35:59,390
And we're able to find out more.
The Germans knew all about the French 

3722
03:35:59,390 --> 03:36:00,120
plans and when they were going to take 
place and what was going to happen.

3723
03:36:01,320 --> 03:36:03,840
And they had known in general for 
months,

3724
03:36:04,140 --> 03:36:06,270
air reconnaissance had told them.
I mean,

3725
03:36:06,271 --> 03:36:11,271
these giant affairs are like giant 
supply dumps that go on for miles and 

3726
03:36:11,271 --> 03:36:14,811
miles and miles.
It's very difficult to keep the enemy 

3727
03:36:14,811 --> 03:36:14,811
from finding out about it,
and in January,

3728
03:36:14,811 --> 03:36:19,761
the Germans had about nine divisions,
opposite novell's armies by the time 

3729
03:36:20,521 --> 03:36:25,521
novels about to launch this attack.
The Germans have 48 and they're waiting 

3730
03:36:26,640 --> 03:36:28,050
and it's a disaster.

3731
03:36:29,190 --> 03:36:31,240
Historian holds your.
Her vague writes quote,

3732
03:36:32,040 --> 03:36:35,740
after several delays due to foul weather
novel 16th,

3733
03:36:35,741 --> 03:36:38,650
April unleashed is our telleria for nine
days,

3734
03:36:38,800 --> 03:36:43,800
and then mounted is infantry charge in 
driving rain reports from agents and 

3735
03:36:43,800 --> 03:36:48,691
French pow,
who's had tipped the Germans off to the 

3736
03:36:48,691 --> 03:36:51,721
coming offensive.
Given the news of the offensive and the 

3737
03:36:51,721 --> 03:36:54,511
difficulty of the terrain,
the Germans were able to halt the main 

3738
03:36:54,511 --> 03:36:55,270
attack before it got beyond their first 
line.

3739
03:36:55,480 --> 03:37:00,480
Whereas novell had forecast a 
penetration of seven or eight miles on 

3740
03:37:00,480 --> 03:37:01,750
the opening day.
The French rarely advanced,

3741
03:37:01,751 --> 03:37:04,870
more than one or two miles.
Losses were horrendous.

3742
03:37:05,080 --> 03:37:07,720
Whereas novell had coldly predicted 
10,000

3743
03:37:07,721 --> 03:37:09,340
casualties.
For the first day.

3744
03:37:09,580 --> 03:37:12,520
The number was 10 times greater after 
the war.

3745
03:37:12,610 --> 03:37:17,610
The historical surface of the French 
general staff placed casualties for the 

3746
03:37:17,610 --> 03:37:19,510
first four days of the offensive at 
30,000

3747
03:37:19,511 --> 03:37:21,370
killed,
100,000

3748
03:37:21,371 --> 03:37:24,570
wounded and 4,000
missing end quote.

3749
03:37:26,180 --> 03:37:31,180
The story of what happened at this 
battle of novels is a wonderful

3750
03:37:32,600 --> 03:37:37,600
no demonstration of how many things can 
go wrong when you're trying to 

3751
03:37:37,600 --> 03:37:39,620
synchronize everything.
So carefully start with the weather.

3752
03:37:40,040 --> 03:37:42,710
Just like at a Ross,
a week before the weather was bad.

3753
03:37:43,020 --> 03:37:43,950
Uh,
you know,

3754
03:37:43,990 --> 03:37:47,600
who has snow during a spring offensive,
but that's what the French face,

3755
03:37:47,601 --> 03:37:48,320
sleet,
snow,

3756
03:37:48,321 --> 03:37:51,500
rain,
creating mud that slowed the progress of

3757
03:37:51,501 --> 03:37:56,501
the infantry,
which had been calculated precisely to 

3758
03:37:56,501 --> 03:37:59,060
keep up with the explosive force field 
of the creeping barrage,

3759
03:37:59,061 --> 03:38:04,061
which this guy in the veil had pioneered
back in for done but never on this kind 

3760
03:38:04,061 --> 03:38:05,270
of a scale.
And in this case,

3761
03:38:05,690 --> 03:38:10,690
the barrage,
the force field got way ahead of the 

3762
03:38:10,690 --> 03:38:13,540
troops exposing the troops to just 
unbelievable amounts of machine gunfire.

3763
03:38:13,610 --> 03:38:17,960
There's one part of this front where the
French have to travel for ever.

3764
03:38:17,961 --> 03:38:20,450
I mean,
miles to take this,

3765
03:38:21,880 --> 03:38:23,710
you know,
height in the distance and and in,

3766
03:38:23,740 --> 03:38:24,760
in this ridge,
they've,

3767
03:38:24,910 --> 03:38:27,970
the Germans have cut all these little 
holes into the side of it,

3768
03:38:28,000 --> 03:38:28,450
you know,
to,

3769
03:38:28,700 --> 03:38:31,780
to add to the ravines and the gorgeous 
and everything that are already in it,

3770
03:38:31,781 --> 03:38:36,781
and they've stuffed machine guns into 
every hole that you can fit into this 

3771
03:38:36,781 --> 03:38:38,110
hillside.
They've got about 4,000

3772
03:38:38,111 --> 03:38:43,111
of them trained on this French infantry 
trying to cross this space and at Eros 

3773
03:38:45,280 --> 03:38:50,280
and here,
you know when you read the history 

3774
03:38:50,280 --> 03:38:52,741
books,
they sound like relatively productive 

3775
03:38:52,741 --> 03:38:56,191
first world war battles because the 
soldiers actually take quite a bit more 

3776
03:38:56,191 --> 03:38:56,860
ground than they did in the earlier 
battles.

3777
03:38:57,070 --> 03:39:02,070
But that's sort of deceiving because 
this is all part of the new German 

3778
03:39:02,070 --> 03:39:05,641
strategy.
This defense in depth with the Germans 

3779
03:39:05,641 --> 03:39:08,551
aren't supposed to fight to the depth 
all up on the front lines now and not 

3780
03:39:08,551 --> 03:39:11,371
give an inch of ground.
They're supposed to fight to a 

3781
03:39:11,371 --> 03:39:11,860
reasonable degree and then retire to the
next line of defense.

3782
03:39:12,100 --> 03:39:14,290
So they're letting the enemy have more 
ground.

3783
03:39:14,470 --> 03:39:16,930
They're just killing more of them while 
they retreat.

3784
03:39:18,600 --> 03:39:21,670
The French actually stumble in to these,
uh,

3785
03:39:22,070 --> 03:39:25,950
first line areas and think that they're 
winning because they're just not finding

3786
03:39:25,951 --> 03:39:30,951
that many Germans.
And then the Germans opened up on them 

3787
03:39:30,951 --> 03:39:30,951
from the second line positions,

3788
03:39:32,030 --> 03:39:33,980
as you might imagine,
a

3789
03:39:33,980 --> 03:39:38,980
government that had been assured that 
they'll call this thing off in 48 hours.

3790
03:39:39,620 --> 03:39:44,620
You know,
it was going to try to cash in on that 

3791
03:39:44,620 --> 03:39:47,531
guarantee.
They actually gave novel and extra day 

3792
03:39:47,531 --> 03:39:50,570
on his 48 our promise.
Here's how writer Gj Meyer describes the

3793
03:39:50,571 --> 03:39:55,571
situation where the politicians come to 
the general and tell him to call the 

3794
03:39:55,571 --> 03:39:58,160
whole thing off.
Now you guaranteed it wasn't going to be

3795
03:39:58,161 --> 03:40:03,161
another song.
You guaranteed we're going to win the 

3796
03:40:03,161 --> 03:40:05,110
war with this thunderbolt.
And here's what my writes quote.

3797
03:40:05,930 --> 03:40:09,950
On April 19th,
three days after the attack starts,

3798
03:40:10,670 --> 03:40:15,670
the war minister intervened,
trying to get Lavelle to stop the 

3799
03:40:15,670 --> 03:40:18,860
general who in demanding approval of his
grand plan had promised to call it off.

3800
03:40:18,890 --> 03:40:21,590
If a breakthrough were not achieved 
within 48 hours,

3801
03:40:21,890 --> 03:40:25,760
refused the very next day,
he found that his chagrin however,

3802
03:40:25,940 --> 03:40:29,210
that he had no choice but to pause the 
divisions at the front.

3803
03:40:29,211 --> 03:40:34,211
We're breaking down both their morale 
and their supplies of ammunition 

3804
03:40:34,211 --> 03:40:35,780
dangerously low laid on the day after 
that,

3805
03:40:35,781 --> 03:40:39,290
April 21st a new phenomenon appeared and
quote

3806
03:40:41,840 --> 03:40:46,840
John Keegan among other historians has 
gone to great length to point out how 

3807
03:40:46,840 --> 03:40:51,011
there's an accordion like backup that 
begins once the timetable is Intel to 

3808
03:40:52,161 --> 03:40:57,161
strictly when the,
when the front elements of these French 

3809
03:40:57,161 --> 03:40:59,771
forces get bogged down,
everything behind it gets traffic 

3810
03:40:59,771 --> 03:41:01,460
jammed.
We've quoted Louis Bar toss a French.

3811
03:41:01,461 --> 03:41:05,660
I'm corporal in the story several times 
and Bartos is at this battle,

3812
03:41:05,810 --> 03:41:10,810
but he never sees anything.
He gets stuck in one of these traffic 

3813
03:41:10,810 --> 03:41:11,390
jams and as far as he knows something's 
going on,

3814
03:41:11,391 --> 03:41:16,391
a mile or two in front of him,
but he doesn't ever get there to find 

3815
03:41:16,391 --> 03:41:19,271
out what it is,
the soldiers who find out what it is 

3816
03:41:19,271 --> 03:41:19,940
though,
begin to react,

3817
03:41:19,941 --> 03:41:22,580
as one might imagine from the horror,
and in this case,

3818
03:41:22,581 --> 03:41:27,380
the tip of the spear in one of these 
areas are French colonial troops.

3819
03:41:29,070 --> 03:41:32,190
The story of what happened was relayed 
to British journalists.

3820
03:41:32,210 --> 03:41:33,630
Philip Gibbs who writes,
quote,

3821
03:41:34,620 --> 03:41:39,620
talking about the French infantry here,
Gibb's talks about how the French were 

3822
03:41:39,620 --> 03:41:42,330
lured into the lightly defended first 
zone only to be attacked by the Germans.

3823
03:41:42,331 --> 03:41:43,920
In the second zone of defense,
he writes,

3824
03:41:43,921 --> 03:41:48,921
quote,
they were to be allowed an easy walk 

3825
03:41:48,921 --> 03:41:49,920
through to their death trap.
That is what happened.

3826
03:41:50,160 --> 03:41:55,160
The French infantry advancing with 
masses of black troops in the colonial 

3827
03:41:55,160 --> 03:41:59,541
corps in the frontline of assault,
all exultant in inspired by a belief in 

3828
03:41:59,541 --> 03:42:03,831
victory,
swept through the forward zone of the 

3829
03:42:03,831 --> 03:42:06,291
German defenses,
astonished and then disconcerted by the 

3830
03:42:06,291 --> 03:42:09,951
scarcity of Germans until an 
annihilating barrage fire dropped upon 

3831
03:42:09,951 --> 03:42:13,590
them and smash their human waves from 
French officers and nurses.

3832
03:42:13,591 --> 03:42:18,591
I heard appalling tails of this tragedy.
The death wail of the black troops froze

3833
03:42:18,931 --> 03:42:23,931
the blood of the freshmen with horror.
Their own losses were immense in a 

3834
03:42:23,931 --> 03:42:27,861
bloody shambles and quote,
the French colonial soldiers which had 

3835
03:42:29,411 --> 03:42:34,411
been thrown into this disaster,
ran screaming back towards their own 

3836
03:42:34,861 --> 03:42:38,850
lines,
yelling piece down with the war,

3837
03:42:39,030 --> 03:42:44,030
death to those who are responsible and 
all of a sudden the French army began to

3838
03:42:47,121 --> 03:42:47,810
collapse.

3839
03:42:49,980 --> 03:42:53,400
Traditionally,
the novel offensive is seen as the straw

3840
03:42:53,401 --> 03:42:55,890
that breaks the camel's back for the 
French military.

3841
03:42:56,700 --> 03:43:01,700
And it's ironic that it would be that 
way because if it's just judged in 

3842
03:43:01,700 --> 03:43:01,700
relation to all the other French 
battles,

3843
03:43:01,700 --> 03:43:03,270
the novella,
fancy is not terrible.

3844
03:43:04,200 --> 03:43:07,890
The casualty bill is horrifying,
but pretty normal for these big battles.

3845
03:43:07,891 --> 03:43:10,410
And remember,
there's people being killed every day on

3846
03:43:10,500 --> 03:43:14,460
so called quiet fronts,
I mean the British casualties every week

3847
03:43:14,461 --> 03:43:19,461
to what they call wastage,
just living on the western front with 

3848
03:43:19,461 --> 03:43:21,420
snipers and bombs and trench raids and 
all that is 5,000

3849
03:43:21,421 --> 03:43:24,750
people a week.
So I mean even between the big battles,

3850
03:43:24,751 --> 03:43:26,070
it's horrible.
But in the big battles,

3851
03:43:26,071 --> 03:43:28,470
the numbers are astronomical by that 
standard.

3852
03:43:28,471 --> 03:43:30,600
The novella fence is not that bad and 
they did gain,

3853
03:43:30,840 --> 03:43:35,840
you know,
a pretty decent amount of ground level 

3854
03:43:35,840 --> 03:43:37,610
three miles in some places.
But this was sold in a completely 

3855
03:43:37,621 --> 03:43:38,610
different way.
The salesmen,

3856
03:43:38,611 --> 03:43:43,611
Robert Nevada,
sold this as the thunderbolt that wins 

3857
03:43:43,611 --> 03:43:46,371
the war.
Everybody's got to have this last push 

3858
03:43:46,371 --> 03:43:48,690
of optimism and and strength and 
resources and gumption to end the war.

3859
03:43:48,691 --> 03:43:53,691
And then we can all go home and the 
sufferings over and a lot of people 

3860
03:43:53,691 --> 03:43:56,160
drank the Koolaid and the crash after 
they drank the Koolaid was worse than if

3861
03:43:56,161 --> 03:43:58,350
they'd never had the Koolaid at all.

3862
03:44:00,860 --> 03:44:05,860
All that optimism boomeranged back on 
Nevada who started to try to recast the 

3863
03:44:06,591 --> 03:44:09,200
marketing just 24 hours into the 
conflict.

3864
03:44:09,201 --> 03:44:11,720
He was no longer talking about war 
winning thunderbolts.

3865
03:44:11,721 --> 03:44:12,560
He was talking about,
hey,

3866
03:44:12,561 --> 03:44:17,561
it's going very well,
modest gains in the sector in this 

3867
03:44:17,561 --> 03:44:20,341
sector,
and no one was buying the recrafting of 

3868
03:44:20,341 --> 03:44:22,691
the marketing strategy.
The French government now has a 

3869
03:44:22,691 --> 03:44:27,611
wonderful little drama on its hands 
where it tries to get rid of Nevada and 

3870
03:44:27,611 --> 03:44:30,941
he won't go quietly.
They put pitocin who's very competent.

3871
03:44:31,470 --> 03:44:34,140
We talked about him earlier in novels,
old job,

3872
03:44:34,141 --> 03:44:39,141
and uh,
they have a face off and you see this 

3873
03:44:39,141 --> 03:44:39,330
wonderful again,
changing the guard between politicians,

3874
03:44:39,331 --> 03:44:44,331
kind of trying to assert their authority
over the generals and this push and tug 

3875
03:44:44,331 --> 03:44:46,080
on who's going to be the ultimate 
authority.

3876
03:44:48,260 --> 03:44:51,650
The one thing that the politicians have 
in their favor is that they're concerned

3877
03:44:51,651 --> 03:44:55,940
about casualties and the generals appear
to not be concerned about casualties and

3878
03:44:55,941 --> 03:45:00,941
the people who are rising up in French 
units up and down the western front are 

3879
03:45:00,941 --> 03:45:05,381
very concerned about casualties.
The novella offensive traditionally is 

3880
03:45:08,031 --> 03:45:10,460
what kicks off what are called the 
[inaudible] 19,

3881
03:45:10,461 --> 03:45:15,461
17 mutinies or the mutinies of 1917.
That's a weird term and it makes it 

3882
03:45:15,461 --> 03:45:17,060
sound like one unit,
rebels,

3883
03:45:17,061 --> 03:45:22,061
and then the rebellion know transfers 
like wildfire up and down the front end 

3884
03:45:22,061 --> 03:45:22,940
and all these units are acting 
simultaneously.

3885
03:45:22,941 --> 03:45:25,340
If that had happened,
the war would've been over for France.

3886
03:45:27,290 --> 03:45:32,290
I mean,
what do you do to stop a rebellion or 

3887
03:45:32,290 --> 03:45:32,320
when it's the army that's rebelling.
If that had happened,

3888
03:45:32,321 --> 03:45:37,321
it would've been all over and the French
government knew it and acted 

3889
03:45:37,321 --> 03:45:37,321
accordingly.
Instead,

3890
03:45:37,321 --> 03:45:40,690
you have to imagine a burning roof with 
the is everywhere,

3891
03:45:40,810 --> 03:45:45,810
you know,
going off into the wind and landing all 

3892
03:45:45,810 --> 03:45:45,850
over the dry grass on the lawn and you 
know,

3893
03:45:45,851 --> 03:45:49,840
the French government is running around 
stamping out fires as they catch hold as

3894
03:45:49,841 --> 03:45:54,070
many as six of these units a day.
We're involved in,

3895
03:45:54,130 --> 03:45:59,130
as I said,
what the French called acts of 

3896
03:45:59,130 --> 03:46:01,291
collective and discipline,
which meant a whole wide range of 

3897
03:46:01,291 --> 03:46:03,961
things.
Sometimes it meant getting drunk as an 

3898
03:46:03,961 --> 03:46:03,961
entire unit and that was the end of 
that.

3899
03:46:03,961 --> 03:46:05,740
We're not going anywhere.
Other Times they just refuse to go up to

3900
03:46:05,741 --> 03:46:09,580
the front.
One forest decided to march on Paris and

3901
03:46:09,581 --> 03:46:11,110
was talked out of that at the last 
minute,

3902
03:46:12,940 --> 03:46:17,940
and a lot of this was tied to the 
Russian revolution going on 

3903
03:46:17,940 --> 03:46:22,861
simultaneously.
The French in the field saw that all of 

3904
03:46:22,861 --> 03:46:25,570
a sudden Russian soldiers,
maybe we're going to get out of fighting

3905
03:46:25,571 --> 03:46:30,571
this work as they'd somehow with the 
people acted together to go after the 

3906
03:46:30,571 --> 03:46:32,620
people that were as Louis Bar Toast 
explained it,

3907
03:46:32,710 --> 03:46:33,610
enslaving them,

3908
03:46:34,690 --> 03:46:39,690
Louis Bartos,
who a socialist and who would have 

3909
03:46:39,690 --> 03:46:41,941
viewed these happenings in Petrograd in 
Russia with great enthusiasm,

3910
03:46:43,750 --> 03:46:48,750
wrote this right around the times.
The outbreaks of collective in 

3911
03:46:48,891 --> 03:46:51,310
discipline are happening in his army.
Quote,

3912
03:46:52,940 --> 03:46:55,280
at this time,
the Russian revolution broke out.

3913
03:46:55,580 --> 03:47:00,580
Those Slavic soldiers only yesterday and
slaved and bent double under the weight 

3914
03:47:00,580 --> 03:47:03,250
of iron discipline unknowingly marched 
off to mass,

3915
03:47:03,251 --> 03:47:06,740
occurs like resigned.
Slaves had thrown off their yolks,

3916
03:47:06,920 --> 03:47:10,430
proclaim their liberty and imposed piece
on their masters.

3917
03:47:10,431 --> 03:47:15,431
Their hangman.
The whole world was stupefied petrified 

3918
03:47:15,431 --> 03:47:19,181
by this revolution,
this collapse of the immense empire of 

3919
03:47:19,181 --> 03:47:22,331
the czars.
These events had repercussions on the 

3920
03:47:22,331 --> 03:47:22,400
western front and throughout the French 
ranks.

3921
03:47:22,610 --> 03:47:27,020
A wind of revolt blew across almost all 
the regiments and quote,

3922
03:47:28,580 --> 03:47:31,010
but as I said,
it was an uneven sort of an affair.

3923
03:47:31,310 --> 03:47:34,970
Sometimes it involved whole units,
large numbers of troops.

3924
03:47:34,971 --> 03:47:39,971
Other Times it was a decision made by 
single individuals alone that they just 

3925
03:47:39,971 --> 03:47:43,250
weren't going to have their lives thrown
into a meat grinder anymore.

3926
03:47:43,251 --> 03:47:48,251
Historian Eric Dorm Bros tries to give 
you a sense of the feeling when he 

3927
03:47:48,251 --> 03:47:48,251
writes,
quote

3928
03:47:48,600 --> 03:47:50,930
already on day two of the novel 
offensive.

3929
03:47:51,080 --> 03:47:55,160
17 soldiers have one regiment left their
post and went to the rear,

3930
03:47:55,250 --> 03:47:58,370
and then in May 30,000
infantry men abandoned the line.

3931
03:47:58,730 --> 03:48:03,730
A junior officer recorded the scene at 
one train station receiving men who'd 

3932
03:48:03,730 --> 03:48:07,570
been rotated out of the line.
Now Bros is quoting and eye witness and 

3933
03:48:07,570 --> 03:48:12,161
the eyewitness to the troops.
Getting away from the front during this 

3934
03:48:12,161 --> 03:48:12,380
rebellious time says,
quote,

3935
03:48:12,800 --> 03:48:16,790
as soon as the train enters with what 
you would say a horde of savages,

3936
03:48:16,970 --> 03:48:21,200
all the doors open on both sides and men
flood out on the platforms,

3937
03:48:21,290 --> 03:48:26,290
shouts,
insults and threats flying all 

3938
03:48:26,290 --> 03:48:26,510
direction,
death to the sugars at home,

3939
03:48:26,600 --> 03:48:27,830
murderers,
pigs,

3940
03:48:27,831 --> 03:48:28,010
that

3941
03:48:28,010 --> 03:48:31,490
they are long lived,
the revolution down with the war.

3942
03:48:31,550 --> 03:48:33,560
It's peace we want,
et cetera.

3943
03:48:34,390 --> 03:48:35,770
Now,
Bros picks up the narrative,

3944
03:48:35,771 --> 03:48:40,771
quote the troubles spread the 68 of 112 
divisions in the French army in June.

3945
03:48:41,650 --> 03:48:44,170
Each reporting one to five mutinous 
incidents,

3946
03:48:44,171 --> 03:48:49,171
but no killing of officers.
The rank and file demanded an end to 

3947
03:48:49,171 --> 03:48:53,070
further attacks,
better pay and living conditions and 

3948
03:48:53,070 --> 03:48:56,371
more furloughs and quote John Keegan and
a couple of other historians have an 

3949
03:48:57,671 --> 03:49:02,671
interesting way of describing this.
This act of rebellion that was breaking 

3950
03:49:02,891 --> 03:49:07,891
out almost spontaneously,
although influenced by other breakouts 

3951
03:49:07,891 --> 03:49:08,140
all across and up and down the western 
front.

3952
03:49:08,410 --> 03:49:10,270
He says it's like a labor strike.

3953
03:49:11,020 --> 03:49:16,020
Like the soldiers had just decided that 
they weren't going to do certain things 

3954
03:49:16,020 --> 03:49:18,220
anymore.
He said it wasn't defeatism.

3955
03:49:18,280 --> 03:49:23,280
It was defensive ism,
meaning that these soldiers were not 

3956
03:49:23,280 --> 03:49:23,710
gonna,
let the Germans come and invade France.

3957
03:49:23,711 --> 03:49:26,890
They weren't going to abandon the line 
and they wouldn't stop fighting,

3958
03:49:26,891 --> 03:49:31,540
but they weren't going to be involved in
any more of these offensives were 130,

3959
03:49:31,541 --> 03:49:33,610
a hundred 40,
a hundred 50,000

3960
03:49:33,611 --> 03:49:36,700
of them were going to become casualties 
in a hopeless cause.

3961
03:49:37,320 --> 03:49:42,320
Let's also remember that it didn't get 
to this point until the French army had 

3962
03:49:42,320 --> 03:49:46,611
suffered in three and a half years about
as many killed as the United States has 

3963
03:49:46,651 --> 03:49:51,651
suffered in all its wars put together.
How would the United States today,

3964
03:49:52,460 --> 03:49:55,130
a nation of 300 million,
France,

3965
03:49:55,131 --> 03:50:00,131
had about 39 or 40 deal with one point 
five or one point 7 million dead in four

3966
03:50:01,431 --> 03:50:04,950
years.
You adjusted for population size,

3967
03:50:04,951 --> 03:50:07,140
that'd be more like seven,
seven and a half million,

3968
03:50:07,141 --> 03:50:09,630
somewhere around there.
Can you imagine?

3969
03:50:10,870 --> 03:50:15,870
Would you expect us to be hangover free 
for the rest of the century in terms of 

3970
03:50:15,971 --> 03:50:20,971
military affairs?
The French had some lingering damage 

3971
03:50:20,971 --> 03:50:22,720
because of this first world war.
Anyone else would.

3972
03:50:22,750 --> 03:50:25,540
It's amazing.
They got back on their feet at all.

3973
03:50:25,780 --> 03:50:30,780
It's also sort of a wonder for the 
allied cause that the Germans are 

3974
03:50:30,780 --> 03:50:31,560
unaware of this somehow.
It's.

3975
03:50:31,610 --> 03:50:36,610
It's funny,
you have the novel offensive that 

3976
03:50:36,610 --> 03:50:36,610
everybody in Germany is talking about on
the streets.

3977
03:50:36,610 --> 03:50:40,591
It's so well known and yet the French 
Army starts falling apart and rebelling 

3978
03:50:40,591 --> 03:50:40,810
and the Germans don't know.

3979
03:50:42,620 --> 03:50:45,530
If you're the French high command and 
you got your army,

3980
03:50:45,880 --> 03:50:50,880
you know,
starting to catch fire like a bunch of 

3981
03:50:50,880 --> 03:50:51,710
rooftop ambers that are falling on dry 
grass.

3982
03:50:51,711 --> 03:50:54,380
What do you do to stop that?
You got to be very careful,

3983
03:50:54,381 --> 03:50:56,180
don't you?
If you give up too much,

3984
03:50:56,181 --> 03:51:01,181
it becomes like what the Russians are 
dealing with where you can't even have 

3985
03:51:01,181 --> 03:51:04,061
the troops in order to run,
where they start electing their own 

3986
03:51:04,061 --> 03:51:04,820
little governing groups and they do what
they want.

3987
03:51:04,880 --> 03:51:09,880
Can't have that,
but if you crack down and get all tough 

3988
03:51:09,880 --> 03:51:09,880
on them,
you might spread the revolution.

3989
03:51:09,880 --> 03:51:14,330
It's a deft and terrible tight rope for 
the French government to walk.

3990
03:51:15,140 --> 03:51:20,140
This new military leader that takes over
for novell Patala is considered to be 

3991
03:51:20,140 --> 03:51:23,411
sort of a soldier's general,
so that helps and he'll famously go 

3992
03:51:23,411 --> 03:51:26,351
around to all these units speaking to 
them and actually promising and 

3993
03:51:26,351 --> 03:51:26,351
delivering some of

3994
03:51:26,351 --> 03:51:28,110
the reforms they want.
For example,

3995
03:51:28,111 --> 03:51:30,600
reforms on home leave,
food,

3996
03:51:30,601 --> 03:51:32,100
drink.
I mean there's a bunch of things that he

3997
03:51:32,101 --> 03:51:35,190
can manage to perk up and,
and take care of that help the troops,

3998
03:51:35,640 --> 03:51:36,900
you know,
griping on the front.

3999
03:51:37,200 --> 03:51:40,230
At the same time,
he has to show who's still in charge.

4000
03:51:40,231 --> 03:51:42,600
This is still a military.
Laws are broken.

4001
03:51:43,080 --> 03:51:47,130
Discipline must be maintained.
The French start a crackdown in July.

4002
03:51:47,131 --> 03:51:50,670
In 1917,
they will court marshal almost 24,000

4003
03:51:50,671 --> 03:51:55,671
soldiers for collective indiscipline 
delish issue about 500 death sentences.

4004
03:51:57,040 --> 03:51:59,680
They will actually carry out less than 
100 of them,

4005
03:52:00,910 --> 03:52:02,860
but there's one thing pitocin can 
change.

4006
03:52:03,100 --> 03:52:08,100
He cannot make this army capable or 
willing or trustworthy to go on another 

4007
03:52:08,261 --> 03:52:11,140
major offensive.
This is an army that has to regroup,

4008
03:52:11,350 --> 03:52:16,350
be rebuilt.
Refortified in Bhutan is going to do a 

4009
03:52:16,350 --> 03:52:18,901
historically famous job of this,
but it's going to take time and in the 

4010
03:52:18,901 --> 03:52:21,841
meantime,
the number one thing that he gives to 

4011
03:52:21,841 --> 03:52:22,720
his troops that they were asking for 
because he's got no choice,

4012
03:52:23,020 --> 03:52:25,900
is that they're not going to be thrown 
into murderous,

4013
03:52:25,960 --> 03:52:28,660
hopeless,
offensives anytime soon.

4014
03:52:29,380 --> 03:52:34,380
This leaves the western front in any 
sort of offensive activity on it for the

4015
03:52:34,751 --> 03:52:37,990
rest of 1917 to the British alone,

4016
03:52:39,180 --> 03:52:44,180
the British commander Douglas Haig is 
fine with that because he has a plan and

4017
03:52:44,901 --> 03:52:49,901
he's wanting to carry it out for some 
time and now that the French are not in 

4018
03:52:49,901 --> 03:52:53,141
his way,
he casts his covetous I on Oprah and the

4019
03:52:54,811 --> 03:52:57,150
Belgian ports,
yet again,

4020
03:52:59,610 --> 03:53:02,670
Douglas Haig,
the British military leader launched the

4021
03:53:02,671 --> 03:53:07,671
British to launch an attack on the 
German defenses in Belgium at Ipa where 

4022
03:53:08,041 --> 03:53:11,220
there's already been two battles of Epri
in this war already.

4023
03:53:12,930 --> 03:53:15,540
Now,
Hague's got a great army to do this with

4024
03:53:15,690 --> 03:53:19,290
the British army in late 1917.
Mid 1917.

4025
03:53:19,320 --> 03:53:21,960
Is is maybe the best army in the war at 
this time.

4026
03:53:21,961 --> 03:53:24,090
It's taken years for the British.
You know,

4027
03:53:24,091 --> 03:53:26,430
traditionally a sea power to build up a 
land power,

4028
03:53:26,820 --> 03:53:28,230
but by July,
August,

4029
03:53:28,231 --> 03:53:29,100
19,
17,

4030
03:53:29,101 --> 03:53:34,101
they've done a great job of doing just 
that and it's millions strong in the 

4031
03:53:34,101 --> 03:53:38,691
British,
had a boutique army when this war 

4032
03:53:38,691 --> 03:53:38,691
started.
Very,

4033
03:53:38,691 --> 03:53:39,000
very fine and professional and 
volunteers,

4034
03:53:39,001 --> 03:53:40,830
but,
but a boutique army.

4035
03:53:41,130 --> 03:53:45,590
What they have in 1917 are a bunch of 
mostly conscripts,

4036
03:53:45,600 --> 03:53:47,190
some volunteers,
but mostly conscripts.

4037
03:53:47,191 --> 03:53:50,130
They don't sing on their way to and from
battle anymore.

4038
03:53:50,131 --> 03:53:52,500
Like in 1914 after the psalm that all 
stopped.

4039
03:53:52,501 --> 03:53:57,501
These are a bunch of grim professionals 
who operate with deadly efficiency and 

4040
03:53:59,521 --> 03:54:00,900
have a sort of a,
a,

4041
03:54:01,040 --> 03:54:06,040
a morale that's hard to describe it and 
they suffered a terrible ordeal the year

4042
03:54:06,331 --> 03:54:08,160
before at the battle of the somme.
Terrible.

4043
03:54:08,190 --> 03:54:13,190
Lost a lot of fantastic people,
but came back with even more artillery 

4044
03:54:13,190 --> 03:54:16,941
pieces here in 1917.
It's a great tool in the hands of Haig 

4045
03:54:16,941 --> 03:54:18,240
and hade wants to use it in Belgium 
against the Germans.

4046
03:54:19,610 --> 03:54:21,830
But there are people that think that 
that's a stupid idea.

4047
03:54:22,520 --> 03:54:24,040
And after several years of

4048
03:54:24,040 --> 03:54:25,540
war,
when you've watched,

4049
03:54:25,940 --> 03:54:30,940
you know,
the same thing happen over and over 

4050
03:54:30,940 --> 03:54:33,301
again in all these battles,
there are people that are going to push 

4051
03:54:33,301 --> 03:54:35,751
back and you're starting to see some of 
these political leaders start to 

4052
03:54:35,751 --> 03:54:36,550
question what the military is doing 
openly to their face.

4053
03:54:36,820 --> 03:54:38,650
And you know,
when we mentioned this earlier,

4054
03:54:38,651 --> 03:54:40,720
I didn't want to insinuate that this 
never happens.

4055
03:54:40,721 --> 03:54:45,721
I mean Abraham Lincoln for example,
famously would argue with the civil war 

4056
03:54:45,721 --> 03:54:47,470
generals and they would resent it.
But in some countries like Germany,

4057
03:54:47,950 --> 03:54:52,950
politicians in Germany do not interfere 
in military strategy and they'd only 

4058
03:54:53,530 --> 03:54:57,970
just started doing that in France with 
the collapse of the Novella offensive,

4059
03:54:58,000 --> 03:55:03,000
right?
It was the novella offensive that sort 

4060
03:55:03,000 --> 03:55:04,591
of brought them into saying,
are you sure we want to do something 

4061
03:55:04,591 --> 03:55:05,980
like this again in Britain?
You know,

4062
03:55:05,981 --> 03:55:07,870
I,
I would think as a modern person reading

4063
03:55:07,871 --> 03:55:09,460
the story,
and I think many of you probably thought

4064
03:55:09,461 --> 03:55:11,680
the same thing.
You're wondering why it took this long.

4065
03:55:11,681 --> 03:55:16,681
How many times can you lose hundreds of 
thousands of people in what appeared to 

4066
03:55:16,681 --> 03:55:19,510
the nonmilitary.
I to be very similar kinds of attacks.

4067
03:55:19,870 --> 03:55:24,870
It'd be a little strange if there 
weren't more people questioning this in 

4068
03:55:24,870 --> 03:55:28,201
Britain.
There are led by the Prime Minister 

4069
03:55:28,201 --> 03:55:28,201
Lloyd George.

4070
03:55:28,770 --> 03:55:33,770
Now George,
to be fair is viewed by history very 

4071
03:55:33,770 --> 03:55:37,041
similarly to the way woodrow Wilson is.
It's almost as though there's a good 

4072
03:55:37,041 --> 03:55:38,520
lawyer George,
and there's an evil Lloyd George and you

4073
03:55:38,521 --> 03:55:40,770
know different histories will portray 
him differently,

4074
03:55:41,070 --> 03:55:46,070
but taken at face value.
Lloyd George presents himself as the 

4075
03:55:46,081 --> 03:55:50,310
person who defends the soldiers from the
generals.

4076
03:55:51,180 --> 03:55:56,180
He says during this whole lead in to 
whether or not hey gets to have his 

4077
03:55:56,180 --> 03:55:57,030
Belgian offensive quote.

4078
03:55:58,910 --> 03:56:03,910
The cabinet must regard themselves as 
trustees for the fine fellows that 

4079
03:56:03,910 --> 03:56:08,111
constitute our army.
They're willing to face any dangers and 

4080
03:56:08,111 --> 03:56:11,651
they do so without complaint,
but they trusted the leaders of the 

4081
03:56:11,651 --> 03:56:14,711
nation to see that their lives are not 
needlessly thrown away and that they're 

4082
03:56:14,711 --> 03:56:18,650
not sacrificed on mere gambles which are
resorted to merely because those who are

4083
03:56:18,651 --> 03:56:23,651
directing the war can think of nothing 
better to do with the men under their 

4084
03:56:23,651 --> 03:56:27,221
command.
It is therefore imperative that before 

4085
03:56:27,221 --> 03:56:30,191
we embark upon a gigantic attack,
which must necessarily entail the loss 

4086
03:56:30,191 --> 03:56:34,460
of scores of thousands of valuable lives
and produce that sense of discouragement

4087
03:56:34,670 --> 03:56:37,820
which might very well rush nations into 
premature piece,

4088
03:56:38,090 --> 03:56:43,090
that we should feel a fair confidence 
that such an attack as a reasonable 

4089
03:56:43,090 --> 03:56:45,060
chance of succeeding Amir gamble would 
be both

4090
03:56:45,200 --> 03:56:48,140
folly and a crime.
And to quote,

4091
03:56:49,590 --> 03:56:54,590
I must confess that to the modern 
observer having just witnessed the 

4092
03:56:54,590 --> 03:56:58,461
several years previous of this war,
you think to yourself when you hear 

4093
03:56:58,461 --> 03:56:59,880
something like that,
it's about damn time,

4094
03:57:01,820 --> 03:57:06,820
but many modern historians wonder.
They wonder if Haig didn't have a pretty

4095
03:57:07,371 --> 03:57:10,880
good feel for this thing and that these 
politicians,

4096
03:57:10,881 --> 03:57:14,240
we're barking up the wrong tree.
Maybe for their own political purposes.

4097
03:57:15,160 --> 03:57:20,160
Haig sure makes it look like Lloyd 
George doesn't know what he's talking 

4098
03:57:20,160 --> 03:57:22,400
about when he opens an operation

4099
03:57:22,700 --> 03:57:24,290
on June seventh,
19,

4100
03:57:24,291 --> 03:57:29,291
17.
To take this high ground that he needs 

4101
03:57:29,291 --> 03:57:30,230
to take before he can have his IEP or 
battle.

4102
03:57:30,470 --> 03:57:35,330
It's called Misener Ridge and the 
British had since 1915.

4103
03:57:35,660 --> 03:57:40,660
Been tunneling under this eight miles of
ridge lines and planting explosives 

4104
03:57:41,421 --> 03:57:46,180
underneath the incredibly deep and 
complicated German defenses up there.

4105
03:57:46,190 --> 03:57:51,190
They were impenetrable,
so the British went underneath them and 

4106
03:57:51,190 --> 03:57:52,310
the Germans knew they were doing some of
this because they found one of them,

4107
03:57:52,760 --> 03:57:54,380
but on June seventh,
19,

4108
03:57:54,390 --> 03:57:57,260
17 when he decides he's going to take 
this high ground,

4109
03:57:57,440 --> 03:58:02,440
he starts off his attack by blowing up 
that eight miles of ridge lines with 

4110
03:58:03,171 --> 03:58:08,171
these munitions.
There's more than a million pounds of 

4111
03:58:08,171 --> 03:58:11,321
explosives underneath those hills and 
when they blow up all within 28 seconds 

4112
03:58:11,321 --> 03:58:14,960
of each other,
supposedly you could hear it in London.

4113
03:58:15,560 --> 03:58:18,680
I've heard some people say it was heard 
in Ireland.

4114
03:58:19,160 --> 03:58:24,160
It's thought to be the biggest manmade 
explosion before nuclear weapons or 

4115
03:58:24,160 --> 03:58:27,530
atomic weapons,
and it vaporizes 10,000

4116
03:58:27,531 --> 03:58:28,640
Germans.
Instantly.

4117
03:58:30,930 --> 03:58:35,930
The second those minds are blown up.
Thousands of British artillery pieces on

4118
03:58:36,391 --> 03:58:41,391
the horizon open fire on this same line 
of ridges and the British,

4119
03:58:42,450 --> 03:58:47,450
80,000
of them who come out of their trenches 

4120
03:58:47,450 --> 03:58:49,641
and and march toward that high ground 
have a pretty darn easy time taking it 

4121
03:58:49,641 --> 03:58:52,770
by first world war standards.
I've got to always throw that in because

4122
03:58:53,010 --> 03:58:55,200
to the naked eye it's still looks like a
lot of people died,

4123
03:58:55,201 --> 03:59:00,201
but by first world war standards,
that's a pretty darn good attack and 

4124
03:59:00,201 --> 03:59:01,880
once again it seems to show that the 
British have found the secret sauce,

4125
03:59:02,100 --> 03:59:04,710
the magic formula of how the tanks and 
the artillery,

4126
03:59:04,711 --> 03:59:09,711
the aircraft,
and it all works together perfectly and 

4127
03:59:09,711 --> 03:59:11,571
boom.
Messina Ridge taken for not that much 

4128
03:59:11,571 --> 03:59:12,060
loss of life.
Seems like,

4129
03:59:12,061 --> 03:59:13,290
Hey,
he knows what he's doing,

4130
03:59:13,440 --> 03:59:15,380
but before he gets approval for this 
battle,

4131
03:59:15,390 --> 03:59:15,850
it Breena.

4132
03:59:15,880 --> 03:59:17,520
He's pulling up the guns.
He's getting ready.

4133
03:59:17,790 --> 03:59:22,790
Lloyd George and company take him into a
back room and make him kind of do a 

4134
03:59:22,790 --> 03:59:26,391
powerpoint presentation for Britain.
Civilian leaders in Hague's sort of 

4135
03:59:26,391 --> 03:59:30,410
grits his teeth and does it and explains
why it'll be a good thing and you know 

4136
03:59:30,410 --> 03:59:34,251
why,
why we should be doing this and why it 

4137
03:59:34,251 --> 03:59:36,351
should be a walk over.
Did you see that wonderful battle we 

4138
03:59:36,351 --> 03:59:38,571
just fought and took Messina Ridge.
Haig will end up getting other generals 

4139
03:59:38,571 --> 03:59:42,060
and admirals to sort of side with him 
against the political leadership.

4140
03:59:42,300 --> 03:59:47,300
There were always politicians who sided 
with the military and thought they're 

4141
03:59:47,300 --> 03:59:48,030
the professionals.
You leave things to them.

4142
03:59:48,210 --> 03:59:53,210
For guys like Churchill or Lloyd George,
who were the ones questioning military 

4143
03:59:53,581 --> 03:59:55,290
leadership.
They were in a very tough position.

4144
03:59:55,291 --> 04:00:00,180
Can you imagine what risk they would 
have run if they had overruled all their

4145
04:00:00,181 --> 04:00:04,110
military professionals and then 200,000
guys get killed in a battle,

4146
04:00:04,860 --> 04:00:08,130
which by the way is almost the default 
result of a lot of these battles.

4147
04:00:08,280 --> 04:00:13,280
So you could pretty much be assured that
that would happen if it happened to the 

4148
04:00:13,280 --> 04:00:13,280
generals.
Oh,

4149
04:00:13,280 --> 04:00:15,030
well it just happened again to the 
generals.

4150
04:00:15,300 --> 04:00:18,810
But if Lloyd George overruled all their 
generals and it happened because of him,

4151
04:00:18,811 --> 04:00:20,070
you be sure he

4152
04:00:20,070 --> 04:00:21,840
would have been roasted.
Um,

4153
04:00:23,370 --> 04:00:27,060
so predictably I'm Douglas Haig gets his
offensive.

4154
04:00:27,570 --> 04:00:32,570
He starts by starting a military 
bombardment of the area right around 

4155
04:00:32,570 --> 04:00:34,110
July 15th,
July 20th,

4156
04:00:34,530 --> 04:00:39,530
before the ground attack starts.
The British will shoot almost 4 million 

4157
04:00:39,540 --> 04:00:41,910
shells to just show you how the 
progression is going.

4158
04:00:42,120 --> 04:00:44,940
A year ago at the somme,
we were all saucer.

4159
04:00:44,941 --> 04:00:49,941
I'd and so was the rest of the world at 
the time when the British shot off a 

4160
04:00:49,941 --> 04:00:52,290
million shells before they started that 
battle for this,

4161
04:00:52,291 --> 04:00:54,150
when they're shooting off almost 4 
million.

4162
04:00:54,151 --> 04:00:59,151
You can see why Germany is concerned 
with finding a way to turn their entire 

4163
04:00:59,641 --> 04:01:02,490
country into a munitions factory.
As we said,

4164
04:01:02,491 --> 04:01:07,491
was the goal on July 30,
first 1917.

4165
04:01:09,380 --> 04:01:14,350
The IPA offensive starts very soon 
afterwards,

4166
04:01:15,300 --> 04:01:20,300
so does the rain.
It will be the rain that will give this 

4167
04:01:20,300 --> 04:01:23,070
battle.
It's unique standout character

4168
04:01:23,800 --> 04:01:27,130
and there are so many battles in the 
first world war that sound the same,

4169
04:01:27,430 --> 04:01:30,550
that only a few stand out and it's 
always for some particular reason.

4170
04:01:30,551 --> 04:01:32,560
It become associated with something 
special.

4171
04:01:32,590 --> 04:01:37,590
You know,
in a horrific way the most casualties 

4172
04:01:37,590 --> 04:01:37,590
are the most shells or the most this or 
that.

4173
04:01:37,590 --> 04:01:40,270
I mean everyone knows Verdun is the 
great artillery meat grinder.

4174
04:01:40,271 --> 04:01:43,300
Offensive.
The Somme is that horrible,

4175
04:01:43,750 --> 04:01:48,490
tragic situation with maybe tragic and 
competence that Bruce will off offensive

4176
04:01:48,491 --> 04:01:51,490
in the east is known for its scope.
Passion Dale,

4177
04:01:51,580 --> 04:01:53,080
which will be the British name for 
third.

4178
04:01:53,081 --> 04:01:54,630
Ipa,
is known for its mud

4179
04:01:55,810 --> 04:01:58,030
and mud.
Doesn't sound like too terrible a thing,

4180
04:01:58,031 --> 04:02:03,031
but when you think about living outdoors
and fighting mud makes a terrible 

4181
04:02:03,031 --> 04:02:07,591
situation worse,
and I don't want to suggest that just 

4182
04:02:07,591 --> 04:02:10,321
because this is probably the worst mud 
anyone has ever fought in in the first 

4183
04:02:10,321 --> 04:02:14,311
world war.
That mud has not been a problem for 

4184
04:02:14,311 --> 04:02:15,040
soldiers on other fronts and another 
battles.

4185
04:02:15,280 --> 04:02:20,280
It's been sort of the bane of the 
existence for people especially in 

4186
04:02:20,280 --> 04:02:24,031
trenches,
but nowhere is the mod like it is in 

4187
04:02:24,031 --> 04:02:24,340
flanders.
The soldiers fighting in it described it

4188
04:02:24,400 --> 04:02:27,370
as having a consistency of porridge or 
cheesecake.

4189
04:02:28,300 --> 04:02:33,300
There is no bottom to it and you sink in
it slowly as you would in quicksand.

4190
04:02:34,270 --> 04:02:39,270
There are a lot of people who died in 
the first two battles of by drowning.

4191
04:02:41,200 --> 04:02:43,870
In addition,
there is a complex,

4192
04:02:44,110 --> 04:02:49,110
very fragile system of dikes and other 
water and flood control measures that 

4193
04:02:49,110 --> 04:02:54,031
have been implemented in that area over 
the centuries to keep the water from 

4194
04:02:54,031 --> 04:02:57,991
taking it over.
The artillery has done great damage to 

4195
04:02:57,991 --> 04:03:01,081
that before third iep right now with 
this wonderful barrage of 4 million 

4196
04:03:01,081 --> 04:03:03,460
shells that the British have have 
launched into this area.

4197
04:03:03,850 --> 04:03:06,640
They've destroyed whatever was left at 
that system,

4198
04:03:07,680 --> 04:03:12,680
but it's when the rain starts that it 
gets horrifying because you take an 

4199
04:03:12,680 --> 04:03:15,861
already horrifying first world war 
western front battlefield of the sort 

4200
04:03:15,861 --> 04:03:17,530
we've described with the giant trenches 
everywhere.

4201
04:03:17,620 --> 04:03:18,430
The vegetation

4202
04:03:18,430 --> 04:03:21,910
all gone except for the little twigs and
sticks that used to be giant trees.

4203
04:03:22,090 --> 04:03:24,810
This horrific hell more door like you 
know,

4204
04:03:24,811 --> 04:03:29,811
landscape and you flood it.
Now we've had battles like the psalm 

4205
04:03:29,811 --> 04:03:31,030
where there will be rain and you will 
have moments of flooding,

4206
04:03:31,031 --> 04:03:34,090
but it isn't like this.
This battlefield will start to flood and

4207
04:03:34,091 --> 04:03:39,091
it will stay that way.
There will only be three dry days in the

4208
04:03:40,270 --> 04:03:42,220
month of August.
In fact,

4209
04:03:42,221 --> 04:03:47,221
they get double the normal rainfall and 
this turns the area into a swamp,

4210
04:03:49,900 --> 04:03:54,010
a swamp of quicksand,
and very quickly with all of the,

4211
04:03:54,250 --> 04:03:56,020
you know,
casualties that start cropping up.

4212
04:03:56,021 --> 04:04:01,021
You get the same kind of situation we 
talked about at the somme where the 

4213
04:04:01,021 --> 04:04:04,321
shell holes which are everywhere filled 
with water become like toxic dumps with 

4214
04:04:04,961 --> 04:04:09,961
human body's decaying in them and the 
remnants of poison gas and trash and the

4215
04:04:10,061 --> 04:04:12,160
results of them using these things as 
latrines.

4216
04:04:12,161 --> 04:04:14,710
I mean it is the most sickening stuff 
you can think of.

4217
04:04:14,711 --> 04:04:19,711
As a matter of fact,
one of the problems confronting the 

4218
04:04:19,711 --> 04:04:20,650
British at this battle is they don't 
have water for the troops.

4219
04:04:20,651 --> 04:04:22,960
They have water everywhere.
They have water coming out their ears,

4220
04:04:22,961 --> 04:04:27,961
but none to drink and these shallow 
holes and the mud will form as nasty and

4221
04:04:30,131 --> 04:04:35,131
enemy to the soldiers fighting in this 
as their know opposition and I don't 

4222
04:04:35,131 --> 04:04:37,150
want to suggest it wasn't bad for the 
Germans either.

4223
04:04:37,151 --> 04:04:39,400
That may be the overlooked side of 
Passchendaele.

4224
04:04:39,550 --> 04:04:42,700
It's so horrible and this is seared into
British consciousness.

4225
04:04:42,701 --> 04:04:44,410
Then it's so horrible for British 
troops,

4226
04:04:44,620 --> 04:04:46,930
which let's remember,
and not just English folks,

4227
04:04:47,110 --> 04:04:49,090
they're Welsh Scotch,
Irish,

4228
04:04:49,120 --> 04:04:50,560
Newfoundland,
Indian,

4229
04:04:50,800 --> 04:04:52,240
Australian,
New Zealand,

4230
04:04:52,241 --> 04:04:55,090
Canadian,
and I'm leaving some out there.

4231
04:04:55,091 --> 04:04:58,780
All their suffering,
but the Germans are suffering too.

4232
04:05:00,490 --> 04:05:03,970
The rain is so bad that within just a 
few days,

4233
04:05:04,210 --> 04:05:07,870
Haig has to call a halt to operations.
The guns are sinking.

4234
04:05:08,200 --> 04:05:10,870
You know the horses are sinking up to 
their chest.

4235
04:05:11,050 --> 04:05:16,050
The people are sinking.
What makes this battle particularly 

4236
04:05:16,050 --> 04:05:18,850
horrifying is that in no other battle in
the first world war,

4237
04:05:18,851 --> 04:05:23,851
do you routinely see the soldiers put in
that unbelievable situation that we 

4238
04:05:23,851 --> 04:05:24,610
quoted,
norman cousins,

4239
04:05:24,611 --> 04:05:29,611
that Scottish soldier,
you know as saying he was given the 

4240
04:05:29,611 --> 04:05:32,260
tools to kill his fellow man if they 
were badly wounded on the battlefield.

4241
04:05:32,650 --> 04:05:36,910
What if they're slowly sinking in mud?
Because that's what was happening.

4242
04:05:37,150 --> 04:05:39,730
When we talk about battles that scar 
nations,

4243
04:05:39,880 --> 04:05:41,890
what do we mean by that?
Well,

4244
04:05:41,891 --> 04:05:44,290
in the first world war,
hundreds of thousands,

4245
04:05:44,291 --> 04:05:47,980
sometimes millions of men would go 
through these terrible places.

4246
04:05:48,220 --> 04:05:49,450
Passion,
Dale's one,

4247
04:05:49,690 --> 04:05:51,010
you know,
Verdun was another.

4248
04:05:51,070 --> 04:05:53,410
The Psalm was another.
The Bruce and love offensive.

4249
04:05:53,411 --> 04:05:55,930
I mean these people who go through these
horrible experiences,

4250
04:05:56,110 --> 04:05:57,970
number in the hundreds of thousands or 
millions.

4251
04:05:58,120 --> 04:06:01,480
Those survivors then go home,
permanently changed.

4252
04:06:01,720 --> 04:06:06,720
How many human beings have to go home 
permanently changed for that to ripple 

4253
04:06:06,720 --> 04:06:10,090
across their entire societies?
Passchendaele did just that,

4254
04:06:10,091 --> 04:06:15,091
and part of the reason why was because 
what these people saw just destroyed 

4255
04:06:15,091 --> 04:06:15,091
them.

4256
04:06:16,430 --> 04:06:21,430
I mean the most widely in a lampooned 
poetic line is wildly lampoon because it

4257
04:06:22,281 --> 04:06:25,340
became so associated with this battle 
and siegfried sassoon road,

4258
04:06:25,610 --> 04:06:28,460
I died in hell.
They called it passion Dale.

4259
04:06:30,500 --> 04:06:34,400
You can see pictures by the way of this 
battle on the battlefield to try to keep

4260
04:06:34,401 --> 04:06:39,401
soldiers from getting stuck in the mud.
They laid down duck boards and so you 

4261
04:06:39,401 --> 04:06:41,000
have and you have to imagine,
go look at pictures.

4262
04:06:41,001 --> 04:06:46,001
It is amazing.
You have a battlefield that looks like 

4263
04:06:46,001 --> 04:06:48,910
the moon.
If the moon had been turned to mud and 

4264
04:06:48,910 --> 04:06:52,931
then on the mud to try to keep people 
from sinking into it as though it's 

4265
04:06:52,931 --> 04:06:57,311
quick sand.
They put these little teeny planks in 

4266
04:06:57,311 --> 04:06:59,120
and and they and they make them look 
like paths you know for,

4267
04:06:59,150 --> 04:07:04,150
for where people need to go.
But what this does is it means that the 

4268
04:07:04,150 --> 04:07:06,881
soldiers have to actually walk on those 
and machine gunners can just target 

4269
04:07:06,881 --> 04:07:07,670
them,
and these duck boards are blown up every

4270
04:07:07,671 --> 04:07:11,000
night by the artillery.
And every night the royal engineers come

4271
04:07:11,001 --> 04:07:13,700
and rebuild them for the next day under 
fire.

4272
04:07:15,530 --> 04:07:17,960
Peter Hart,
in his wonderful book on the First World

4273
04:07:17,960 --> 04:07:18,710
War,
the Great War,

4274
04:07:19,010 --> 04:07:24,010
quotes private Norman Cliff,
a British soldier in the first grand 

4275
04:07:24,010 --> 04:07:25,550
dear guards describing you know what was
happening,

4276
04:07:25,551 --> 04:07:27,200
and it happened to thousands of 
soldiers,

4277
04:07:27,410 --> 04:07:32,410
quote the approach to the Ridge was a 
desolate swamp over which brew did an 

4278
04:07:32,410 --> 04:07:37,391
eval menacing atmosphere that seemed to 
defy encroachment far more treacherous 

4279
04:07:37,391 --> 04:07:40,580
than the visible surface defenses with 
which we were familiar,

4280
04:07:40,581 --> 04:07:44,030
such as barbed wire,
deep devouring mud spread,

4281
04:07:44,031 --> 04:07:49,031
deadly traps in all directions.
We splashed and slithered and dragged 

4282
04:07:49,031 --> 04:07:50,480
our feet from the pull of an invisible 
enemy,

4283
04:07:50,600 --> 04:07:55,600
determined to suck us into its depths.
Every few steps someone would slide and 

4284
04:07:55,600 --> 04:08:00,131
stumble and weighed down by rifle and 
equipment rapidly sink into the 

4285
04:08:00,131 --> 04:08:02,630
squelching mess.
Those nearest grabbed his arms,

4286
04:08:02,690 --> 04:08:06,560
struggled against being themselves 
engulfed and if humanly possible dragged

4287
04:08:06,561 --> 04:08:11,561
him out.
When helpers floundered in as well and 

4288
04:08:11,561 --> 04:08:11,780
doubled the task,
it became hopeless.

4289
04:08:12,050 --> 04:08:14,950
All the straining efforts failed and the
swamps swallowed.

4290
04:08:14,951 --> 04:08:19,951
It's screaming victims,
and we had to be ordered to Plod on 

4291
04:08:19,951 --> 04:08:21,620
dejectedly and fight.
This relentless enemy has stubbornly.

4292
04:08:21,621 --> 04:08:26,621
As we did those we could see it happened
that one of those leading us was 

4293
04:08:26,621 --> 04:08:27,150
Lieutenant Chamberlain and so 
distracted.

4294
04:08:27,170 --> 04:08:32,170
He become at the spectacle of men 
drowning in mud and the desperate 

4295
04:08:32,170 --> 04:08:35,831
attempts to rescue them,
that suddenly he began hysterically 

4296
04:08:35,831 --> 04:08:37,550
belaboring the shoulders of a singing 
man with his swagger stick.

4297
04:08:37,880 --> 04:08:41,240
We were horror struck to see this most 
compassionate officer,

4298
04:08:41,300 --> 04:08:44,780
so unstrung as to resort to brutality 
and are loud.

4299
04:08:44,781 --> 04:08:48,260
Protests forced him to desist.
The man was rescued,

4300
04:08:48,440 --> 04:08:50,450
but some could not be,
and they sank.

4301
04:08:50,451 --> 04:08:53,090
Shrieking with fear and agony to be 
ordered.

4302
04:08:53,091 --> 04:08:57,440
To Go ahead and leave a comrade to such 
a fate was the hardest experience.

4303
04:08:57,560 --> 04:09:02,560
One could be asked to endure,
but the objective had to be reached and 

4304
04:09:02,560 --> 04:09:06,491
we plunged on bitter anger against the 
evil forces prevailing piled onto our 

4305
04:09:06,491 --> 04:09:11,471
exasperations.
This was as near to hell as I ever want 

4306
04:09:11,471 --> 04:09:14,340
to be and to quote,
and Brian Cooper's

4307
04:09:14,340 --> 04:09:18,620
the ironclads of Cumbrae.
He quotes a soldier at IPR saying,

4308
04:09:18,621 --> 04:09:21,450
quote,
one of our men was unfortunate enough to

4309
04:09:21,451 --> 04:09:24,660
step out of line and fell into one of 
these mud holes.

4310
04:09:24,870 --> 04:09:27,630
We managed to loop a rope securely under
his armpits,

4311
04:09:27,810 --> 04:09:32,810
but it was useless.
The poor fellow now knew he was beyond 

4312
04:09:32,810 --> 04:09:34,530
all aid and begged me to shoot him 
rather than leave him to die.

4313
04:09:34,531 --> 04:09:39,531
A miserable death by suffocation.
I am not afraid to say therefore that I 

4314
04:09:39,531 --> 04:09:41,430
shot this man at his own urgent request.

4315
04:09:42,060 --> 04:09:46,120
End Quote.
In the accounts,

4316
04:09:46,121 --> 04:09:51,121
it's clear that this particular mode of 
dying affected the soldiers you know 

4317
04:09:51,121 --> 04:09:55,951
worse than most of the other ones.
This is the true extra horror of 

4318
04:09:55,951 --> 04:09:56,320
Passchendaele of 30 [inaudible]

4319
04:09:58,780 --> 04:10:01,960
writer Adam Hochschild in his book to 
end all wars,

4320
04:10:02,200 --> 04:10:05,740
quotes of British major at Third Ybarra 
who says,

4321
04:10:05,741 --> 04:10:07,930
quote,
a party of a company,

4322
04:10:07,931 --> 04:10:12,580
men passing up to the front line found a
man bogged to above the knees,

4323
04:10:12,790 --> 04:10:14,980
bogged with mud.
He means he says,

4324
04:10:14,981 --> 04:10:19,981
quote,
the united efforts of four of them with 

4325
04:10:19,981 --> 04:10:21,430
rifles beneath his armpits,
made not the slightest impression,

4326
04:10:21,580 --> 04:10:26,580
and to dig even if shovels had been 
available would be impossible for there 

4327
04:10:26,580 --> 04:10:28,930
was no foothold.
Duty compelled them to move on up to the

4328
04:10:28,931 --> 04:10:33,931
line and when two days later they passed
down that way the wretched fellow was 

4329
04:10:33,931 --> 04:10:36,400
still there,
but only his head was now visible and he

4330
04:10:36,401 --> 04:10:41,401
was raving mad and to quote,
and just like most of the other bad 

4331
04:10:43,051 --> 04:10:48,051
world war one battles,
you know the people stuck out in no 

4332
04:10:48,051 --> 04:10:51,570
man's land that you couldn't go get 
drove the men in the trenches.

4333
04:10:51,571 --> 04:10:56,250
They're comrades.
Just almost insane with powerlessness.

4334
04:10:57,780 --> 04:11:00,730
Historian John Keegan quotes British 
soldier Edwin Vaughn,

4335
04:11:01,160 --> 04:11:06,160
who was at the third IPA and who 
describes how the rain takes a known 

4336
04:11:06,331 --> 04:11:11,331
horrific situation.
The people stuck in no man's land and 

4337
04:11:11,331 --> 04:11:14,010
the suffering that they went through and
the suffering that they then transmitted

4338
04:11:14,011 --> 04:11:19,011
to their powerless comrades in the 
trenches and made it worse by just 

4339
04:11:19,011 --> 04:11:19,011
adding water.

4340
04:11:20,670 --> 04:11:24,330
Soldier von talks about being in a shell
hole and then says,

4341
04:11:24,331 --> 04:11:24,720
quote

4342
04:11:26,070 --> 04:11:29,940
from other shell holes from the darkness
on all sides came,

4343
04:11:29,941 --> 04:11:34,440
the groans and whales of wounded men 
faint long sobbing,

4344
04:11:34,441 --> 04:11:39,441
moans of agony and despairing shrieks.
It was too horribly obvious that dozens 

4345
04:11:39,441 --> 04:11:44,391
of men with serious wounds must've 
crawled for safety into new shell holes 

4346
04:11:44,391 --> 04:11:47,610
and now the water was rising about them 
and powerless to move.

4347
04:11:47,760 --> 04:11:52,760
They were slowly drowning.
Horrible visions came to me with those 

4348
04:11:52,760 --> 04:11:53,730
cries of men lying,
maimed out there,

4349
04:11:53,731 --> 04:11:58,440
trusting that their pals would find them
and now dying terribly alone amongst the

4350
04:11:58,441 --> 04:12:01,830
dead and the inky darkness and we could 
do nothing to help them.

4351
04:12:02,100 --> 04:12:07,100
Dunham was crying quietly beside me and 
all the men were affected by the 

4352
04:12:07,100 --> 04:12:08,040
prettiest cries.
And the quote,

4353
04:12:09,720 --> 04:12:13,000
Lieutenant Edwin Vaughn and men are 
relieved a couple hours later.

4354
04:12:14,160 --> 04:12:16,590
And as they're walking back down the 
line,

4355
04:12:16,890 --> 04:12:21,890
he noticed his quote,
the cries of the wounded had been much 

4356
04:12:21,890 --> 04:12:23,010
diminished now,
and as we staggered down the road,

4357
04:12:23,160 --> 04:12:28,160
the reason was only two apparent for the
water was right over the tops of the 

4358
04:12:28,160 --> 04:12:30,580
shell holes and quote.
Now,

4359
04:12:30,581 --> 04:12:35,581
if you want it to look at this battle 
which went on for months in military 

4360
04:12:35,581 --> 04:12:38,830
terms and you wanted to look at it 
positively as some modern historians do,

4361
04:12:39,100 --> 04:12:44,100
you could say that it killed between 220
and 350,000

4362
04:12:44,441 --> 04:12:46,030
more Germans.
Nothing wrong with that.

4363
04:12:46,120 --> 04:12:50,470
In a war of attrition right course,
if you're the British political command,

4364
04:12:50,471 --> 04:12:55,471
you will.
You'll note that it killed about the 

4365
04:12:55,471 --> 04:12:55,471
same number of British soldiers.

4366
04:12:56,860 --> 04:13:01,860
It gained a few miles in some places.
The Canadians heroically captured the 

4367
04:13:01,860 --> 04:13:06,810
town of Passchendaele against all odds 
and through much suffering and 

4368
04:13:06,810 --> 04:13:07,780
persevering.
But again,

4369
04:13:08,380 --> 04:13:13,380
it's not quite apparent how this really 
pushed the end of the war any closer.

4370
04:13:15,870 --> 04:13:18,270
It definitely pushed a lot of soldiers 
though,

4371
04:13:18,810 --> 04:13:23,130
closer to a transformation that they 
would eventually,

4372
04:13:23,131 --> 04:13:27,960
if they lived to make it home transfer 
to their entire society.

4373
04:13:28,350 --> 04:13:31,500
British soldier,
Ronald Skirt was for ever transformed by

4374
04:13:31,501 --> 04:13:35,640
his experiences in flanders in 1917,
as were so many others.

4375
04:13:35,910 --> 04:13:39,120
It crushed the underpinnings of so much 
of his worldview.

4376
04:13:39,630 --> 04:13:42,510
He writes about the battle quote.
I said,

4377
04:13:42,511 --> 04:13:46,350
the men's morale was breaking.
I suppose I should have included myself.

4378
04:13:46,620 --> 04:13:50,280
I had long since lost any desire to 
continue as a fighting soldier.

4379
04:13:50,490 --> 04:13:53,670
Idealists and cowards aren't of much use
on a battlefield,

4380
04:13:53,671 --> 04:13:56,010
and I was a bit of both.
At 19,

4381
04:13:56,011 --> 04:13:58,620
I found my standards of conduct 
obsolete.

4382
04:13:58,890 --> 04:14:03,890
My ideal shattered.
I had lost all faith in institutional 

4383
04:14:03,890 --> 04:14:05,430
religion.
My church had authorized me to break the

4384
04:14:05,431 --> 04:14:08,880
sixth commandment in the name of 
patriotism and quote

4385
04:14:10,340 --> 04:14:13,490
he continues quote.
Eventually I worked at all out.

4386
04:14:13,820 --> 04:14:16,520
At least for myself.
God was all right.

4387
04:14:16,730 --> 04:14:21,730
It was we who were wrong.
Why the hell should he care what 

4388
04:14:21,730 --> 04:14:25,271
happened to us a lot?
We had brought this war evil into 

4389
04:14:25,271 --> 04:14:25,271
existence,
not God.

4390
04:14:25,271 --> 04:14:28,760
The reason evil and ugliness were 
triumphing over goodness and beauty.

4391
04:14:28,970 --> 04:14:30,320
Why?
Pity and compassion.

4392
04:14:30,321 --> 04:14:35,321
We're considered weaknesses and 
ruthlessness and cruelty regarded as 

4393
04:14:35,321 --> 04:14:38,930
noble.
The reason for all this was the 

4394
04:14:38,930 --> 04:14:39,350
wickedness in ourselves and not the 
indifference of God.

4395
04:14:39,710 --> 04:14:41,810
That's why the more murders you 
committed,

4396
04:14:41,930 --> 04:14:46,930
the bigger the hero you became.
That's what made your superior officers 

4397
04:14:46,930 --> 04:14:48,590
slap you on the back and say,
splendid old chap,

4398
04:14:48,591 --> 04:14:51,950
jolly good shooting when your shells had
destroyed in minutes,

4399
04:14:52,130 --> 04:14:56,990
the beauty which craftsman had toiled 
lifetimes to create disillusion is very,

4400
04:14:56,991 --> 04:14:58,430
very bitter.
When you're young,

4401
04:14:58,610 --> 04:15:00,080
thoughtful,
imaginative,

4402
04:15:00,110 --> 04:15:02,150
and sensitive and quote

4403
04:15:03,960 --> 04:15:08,870
in the postscript to his memoirs,
writing in the third person skirts,

4404
04:15:09,230 --> 04:15:14,000
quote before 19,
17 ended this unbelieved.

4405
04:15:14,001 --> 04:15:19,001
You're insensitive.
Youth had escaped death by inches a 

4406
04:15:19,001 --> 04:15:22,751
dozen times,
had seen his comrades die in dreadful 

4407
04:15:22,751 --> 04:15:23,960
agony.
Had seen and heard man,

4408
04:15:23,961 --> 04:15:26,630
who should have been dead.
Men broken,

4409
04:15:26,750 --> 04:15:31,190
torn limbless,
disemboweled screaming for anyone with a

4410
04:15:31,191 --> 04:15:33,140
loaded rifle to end.
They're unbearable.

4411
04:15:33,141 --> 04:15:38,141
Sufferings and watched his friends and 
others slowly choke and froth is poison.

4412
04:15:38,481 --> 04:15:42,550
Gas suffocated them could not believe it
possible until his own eyes.

4413
04:15:42,570 --> 04:15:47,570
Told him it was that half a man could 
live for what seemed to him hours and by

4414
04:15:47,901 --> 04:15:52,901
the time he was rendered unconscious 
himself had come to realize that every 

4415
04:15:52,901 --> 04:15:56,801
friend he'd made,
every man he'd worked with had become 

4416
04:15:56,801 --> 04:16:00,161
cannon fodder for years afterwards.
Memories of these horrors haunted his 

4417
04:16:00,161 --> 04:16:02,930
dreams and disturbed his sleep,
yet awake.

4418
04:16:02,931 --> 04:16:07,931
He could never bring himself to talk to 
them and when he thought of those 

4419
04:16:07,931 --> 04:16:09,530
wounded men and the comrades he'd been 
with when they were killed,

4420
04:16:09,710 --> 04:16:13,880
he always came to the same conclusion.
It must never happen again.

4421
04:16:14,090 --> 04:16:19,090
Never and to quote,
there were hundreds of thousands of 

4422
04:16:20,511 --> 04:16:25,511
survivors like this young man,
and they went home and greatly 

4423
04:16:27,081 --> 04:16:29,870
influenced their home societies.
I mean,

4424
04:16:29,871 --> 04:16:34,871
there are literary historians that will 
point to the influence these people had 

4425
04:16:34,871 --> 04:16:38,690
in the writings of the 19 twenties and 
19 thirties everywhere.

4426
04:16:41,120 --> 04:16:42,830
War Artists,
Paul Nash,

4427
04:16:42,831 --> 04:16:45,860
was another one permanently affected by 
Passchendaele.

4428
04:16:46,430 --> 04:16:49,310
He'd been to other areas and thought the
war quite nice,

4429
04:16:49,311 --> 04:16:53,990
and then went to passchendaele and had 
his entire world turned upside down.

4430
04:16:54,290 --> 04:16:57,830
This is as related by David Reynolds in 
his fine history,

4431
04:16:57,831 --> 04:17:02,831
the long shadow.
He starts off by saying that Nash 

4432
04:17:02,831 --> 04:17:04,900
enjoyed all these other areas of the war
and then writes quote,

4433
04:17:05,290 --> 04:17:08,630
but when Nash returned in November to 
the rain and mode of passion,

4434
04:17:08,631 --> 04:17:13,631
Dale,
he was transfixed by quote the most 

4435
04:17:13,631 --> 04:17:15,910
frightful nightmare of a country more 
conceived by Dante or po.

4436
04:17:15,911 --> 04:17:19,930
Then by nature,
with no glimmer of God's hand to be seen

4437
04:17:19,931 --> 04:17:24,931
anywhere.
Sunrise and sunset or blasphemies 

4438
04:17:24,931 --> 04:17:25,300
Reynolds says he exclaimed,
quote,

4439
04:17:25,600 --> 04:17:30,600
they are mockeries to man and quote.
Reynolds writes that the scene he says 

4440
04:17:32,741 --> 04:17:37,741
was gilded with the colors of hell,
yellow stinking mud shell holes filled 

4441
04:17:37,741 --> 04:17:42,631
with green whitewater,
black dying trees and unceasing shells 

4442
04:17:42,671 --> 04:17:45,070
that churned up the land into a 
graveyard.

4443
04:17:45,210 --> 04:17:50,210
Quote coding nationality.
I am no longer in artists interested in 

4444
04:17:50,210 --> 04:17:55,021
curious.
I am a messenger who will bring back 

4445
04:17:55,021 --> 04:17:57,100
word from the men who are fighting to 
those who want the war to go on forever.

4446
04:17:57,280 --> 04:17:59,860
Feeble,
inarticulate will be my message,

4447
04:18:00,100 --> 04:18:03,930
but it will have a bitter truth and may 
have burned their lousy souls.

4448
04:18:04,440 --> 04:18:05,110
And quote

4449
04:18:06,840 --> 04:18:09,140
British war correspondent,
Philip Gibbs was there,

4450
04:18:09,141 --> 04:18:14,141
has been.
If I keep us all over that battlefield 

4451
04:18:14,141 --> 04:18:16,990
and he had a true admiration for not 
just the English troops but all the 

4452
04:18:17,730 --> 04:18:19,780
dominion troops to and what they 
accomplished,

4453
04:18:19,781 --> 04:18:24,781
their sort of a doomed heroism and gibbs
was just blown away by what human beings

4454
04:18:25,670 --> 04:18:30,670
in these gallon soldiers were able to 
achieve and nothing upset him more than 

4455
04:18:30,670 --> 04:18:34,931
to hear later that Sir Douglas Haig.
The British commander had proclaimed 

4456
04:18:34,931 --> 04:18:39,710
reports of the battlefield at 
Passchendaele as being exaggerated.

4457
04:18:40,610 --> 04:18:43,460
This is how a very angry gibbs 
responded.

4458
04:18:43,490 --> 04:18:48,490
Quote Sir Douglas Haig thinks that some 
of the descriptions of that six months 

4459
04:18:48,490 --> 04:18:53,291
horror where quote end quote exaggerated
as a man who knows something of the 

4460
04:18:53,291 --> 04:18:57,731
value of words and who saw many of those
battles scenes in flanders and went out 

4461
04:18:57,731 --> 04:19:02,141
from her many times during those months 
and then he names all the places that 

4462
04:19:02,141 --> 04:19:05,891
he'd been and ends up by saying and 
beyond to polygon wood and Passion Dale,

4463
04:19:06,020 --> 04:19:11,020
where his dad lay meaning the dead.
That Haig was responsible for where his 

4464
04:19:11,871 --> 04:19:16,871
dead lay in the swamps and round the 
pillboxes and were tanks that are 

4465
04:19:16,871 --> 04:19:17,870
wallowed into the mire were shot into 
scrap.

4466
04:19:17,871 --> 04:19:22,871
Iron by German gunfire and where our own
guns were being flung up by the 

4467
04:19:22,871 --> 04:19:27,071
harassing fire of heavy shells.
I say now that nothing that has been 

4468
04:19:27,071 --> 04:19:30,881
written is more than a pale image of the
abomination of those battlefields and 

4469
04:19:30,881 --> 04:19:35,411
that no pen or brush has yet achieved 
the picture of that Armageddon in which 

4470
04:19:35,411 --> 04:19:37,070
so many of our men perished and quote,

4471
04:19:38,880 --> 04:19:43,880
many people began to doubt British 
military leadership just because they 

4472
04:19:43,880 --> 04:19:46,890
would think you should ever fighting 
conditions that were that bad.

4473
04:19:47,160 --> 04:19:49,560
There's a story and some people doubted,
ever happened.

4474
04:19:49,561 --> 04:19:54,561
It used to be something that was 
mentioned by almost everyone writing 

4475
04:19:54,561 --> 04:19:55,410
about passion Dale.
In his book in Flanders Fields.

4476
04:19:55,411 --> 04:20:00,240
Leon Wolf tells the story his way and 
says the following day,

4477
04:20:00,390 --> 04:20:05,390
Lieutenant General Sir Lancelot Cagle 
paid his first visit to the fighting 

4478
04:20:05,390 --> 04:20:08,680
zone as a staff car lurched through the 
swamp land and near the battleground,

4479
04:20:08,760 --> 04:20:11,280
he became more and more agitated.
Finally,

4480
04:20:11,281 --> 04:20:13,890
he burst into tears and muttered good 
God.

4481
04:20:13,891 --> 04:20:18,891
Did we really send men to fight in that 
the man beside him who had been through 

4482
04:20:18,891 --> 04:20:23,661
the campaign replied tone.
Leslie gets worse further on up and to 

4483
04:20:23,661 --> 04:20:28,371
quote some say,
it would be ridiculous to think that 

4484
04:20:28,371 --> 04:20:31,911
these military folks had not been out to
the field and seeing the conditions are 

4485
04:20:31,911 --> 04:20:35,721
known what they were like.
I'm not going to take a position on 

4486
04:20:35,721 --> 04:20:38,571
that.
All I will suggest is that there were a 

4487
04:20:38,571 --> 04:20:40,950
lot of people who looked at the 
conditions of passion Dale and wondered,

4488
04:20:41,580 --> 04:20:46,580
you know,
what was going on in the heads of 

4489
04:20:46,580 --> 04:20:46,580
Britain's military leaders.

4490
04:20:46,870 --> 04:20:51,870
Passchendaele is one of the most often 
cited nightmares of this war to 

4491
04:20:52,301 --> 04:20:55,390
Britain's along with the song and just 
like the psalm,

4492
04:20:55,780 --> 04:20:58,840
it did terrible damage to Britain's 
army,

4493
04:21:00,510 --> 04:21:05,380
British military historian John Keegan,
who is definitely in the Anti Haig camp,

4494
04:21:05,381 --> 04:21:10,381
wrote quote on the Psalm.
He had sent the flower of British youth 

4495
04:21:10,381 --> 04:21:14,550
to death or mutilation at passchendaele.
He had tipped the survivors into the 

4496
04:21:14,550 --> 04:21:19,291
slew of despond and quote for those in 
Britain's political class that wished 

4497
04:21:21,010 --> 04:21:23,470
the generals would pay more attention to
casualties.

4498
04:21:23,471 --> 04:21:27,280
They would get their wish,
but not for an entire generation.

4499
04:21:28,090 --> 04:21:33,090
The junior officers at places like 
passchendaele would be permanently 

4500
04:21:33,090 --> 04:21:36,811
affected by that battle.
British military writer Brigadier Peter 

4501
04:21:36,811 --> 04:21:36,811
Young wrote,
quote,

4502
04:21:37,630 --> 04:21:42,630
the memory of this battle affected 
British leadership in the Second World 

4503
04:21:42,630 --> 04:21:46,830
War,
causing many commanders to go to 

4504
04:21:46,830 --> 04:21:47,410
extremes to try to avoid casualties and 
quote,

4505
04:21:48,460 --> 04:21:53,460
this attitude will come a generation too
late for leaders like Lloyd George,

4506
04:21:56,650 --> 04:22:01,650
he and his allies had tried to call off 
the passchendaele campaign after the 

4507
04:22:01,650 --> 04:22:05,521
first sort of impetus was spent only to 
fail once again up against the military 

4508
04:22:06,641 --> 04:22:10,440
leadership and was heard to say blood 
and mud,

4509
04:22:10,620 --> 04:22:13,090
bloods and mod.
They can think of nothing better,

4510
04:22:15,460 --> 04:22:19,560
but it should be said,
even though the British are suffering,

4511
04:22:19,561 --> 04:22:24,561
these kinds of casualties,
so are the Germans and their soldiers 

4512
04:22:24,871 --> 04:22:29,871
are being as tragically affected by this
fighting as the British soldiers.

4513
04:22:34,340 --> 04:22:39,340
The German general Hermann von Cool 
wrote in his report about the troops 

4514
04:22:39,340 --> 04:22:41,990
fighting in flanders quote,
the sufferings,

4515
04:22:41,991 --> 04:22:43,520
privation,
and exertions,

4516
04:22:43,521 --> 04:22:46,700
which the soldiers had to bear were 
indescribable.

4517
04:22:47,060 --> 04:22:52,060
Terrible,
was the spiritual burden on the lonely 

4518
04:22:52,060 --> 04:22:52,880
man in a shell hole or trench and 
terrible.

4519
04:22:52,881 --> 04:22:55,640
The strain on the nerves during the 
British bombardment,

4520
04:22:56,000 --> 04:23:01,000
which continued day and night,
the hell of Verdun and the Somme was 

4521
04:23:01,000 --> 04:23:02,420
exceeded by flanders,
the battle,

4522
04:23:02,421 --> 04:23:05,630
the whole flanders has been the greatest
martyrdom of the war,

4523
04:23:05,840 --> 04:23:10,840
and looking back,
it seems that what was born here was 

4524
04:23:10,840 --> 04:23:12,920
superhuman,
but perhaps it may still prove to be too

4525
04:23:12,921 --> 04:23:16,370
great.
A courageous sacrifice and to quote,

4526
04:23:18,390 --> 04:23:23,390
well,
what general cool didn't know December 

4527
04:23:23,390 --> 04:23:26,091
1917 was that something was taking root 
that would end up leading to the German 

4528
04:23:30,901 --> 04:23:35,610
military commanders getting their hands 
on between 500,000

4529
04:23:36,210 --> 04:23:41,210
and a million fresh veteran rested 
soldiers.

4530
04:23:43,380 --> 04:23:48,380
Fate is about to put the dice,
the iron dice back into the hands of 

4531
04:23:48,380 --> 04:23:52,110
Germany's leadership.
It's well known.

4532
04:23:52,400 --> 04:23:57,400
They are already inveterate gamblers and
the chance to try to throw a knockout 

4533
04:23:59,251 --> 04:24:04,251
punch in a war where both sides like 
badly beat up and permanently damaged 

4534
04:24:05,931 --> 04:24:08,330
fighters will be irresistible.

4535
04:24:09,910 --> 04:24:12,730
Seems like no matter what Lloyd George 
does,

4536
04:24:13,480 --> 04:24:16,060
there's more blood and mud and the 
world's future.

4537
04:24:17,760 --> 04:24:18,870
In 1918.

show.

4544
04:24:45,440 --> 04:24:47,980
I'd like to apologize for a couple of 
things right off the bat.

4545
04:24:48,640 --> 04:24:53,050
The first thing is for silly little 
persnickety mistakes

4546
04:24:54,330 --> 04:24:59,330
you can probably tell,
especially if you wait for these 

4547
04:24:59,330 --> 04:25:01,110
programs to be released as we make them,
that I'm a bit of a nut when it comes to

4548
04:25:01,111 --> 04:25:06,111
detail and yet the people around me keep
telling me that there's a certain 

4549
04:25:06,111 --> 04:25:08,490
failure rate that should be expected.
I'm not really good at accepting that,

4550
04:25:08,491 --> 04:25:11,280
especially when I catch the errors 
before the show gets out.

4551
04:25:11,820 --> 04:25:16,820
Nonetheless,
this one will go out with me saying the 

4552
04:25:16,820 --> 04:25:20,211
word trenches to describe the kinds of 
fortifications that the British Orien at

4553
04:25:21,931 --> 04:25:26,220
passchendaele and of course shell holes 
would be a much closer term.

4554
04:25:26,221 --> 04:25:31,221
I think trenches to those British 
soldiers would have been a luxury on 

4555
04:25:31,221 --> 04:25:31,221
that battlefield.
Nonetheless,

4556
04:25:31,221 --> 04:25:36,200
those are the pedal.
The little things that slipped through 

4557
04:25:36,200 --> 04:25:39,321
our strainer here,
even when we catch them so that these 

4558
04:25:39,321 --> 04:25:42,231
shows come out more than once a year,
which we are just barely beating that I 

4559
04:25:42,231 --> 04:25:46,340
think right now,
heading toward once a year if this pace 

4560
04:25:46,340 --> 04:25:49,071
keeps up.
So I apologize for the piddly little 

4561
04:25:49,071 --> 04:25:49,071
errors in the past.
The ones in this show,

4562
04:25:49,071 --> 04:25:50,440
any in the future.
Um,

4563
04:25:50,550 --> 04:25:55,550
we try hard but we're not perfect.
The other thing I'd like to apologize 

4564
04:25:56,281 --> 04:26:01,281
for his,
for perhaps ignoring your favorite part 

4565
04:26:01,281 --> 04:26:01,281
of this story,
whatever that might be.

4566
04:26:01,310 --> 04:26:03,470
A favorite region,
a favorite army,

4567
04:26:03,471 --> 04:26:05,250
a favorite people or favorite event.

4568
04:26:07,000 --> 04:26:11,290
Picking a topic like this is humbling 
and you know,

4569
04:26:11,380 --> 04:26:15,400
once again shows you some of the 
potential downsides with our leap before

4570
04:26:15,401 --> 04:26:18,040
we look topic picking policy here on the
program.

4571
04:26:18,810 --> 04:26:19,750
Um,
nonetheless,

4572
04:26:19,751 --> 04:26:23,110
I will forgive in advance from now on.
I promise I've learned my lesson,

4573
04:26:23,470 --> 04:26:28,470
every historian and author who talks too
much about the western front at the 

4574
04:26:28,571 --> 04:26:33,571
expense of other areas of the first 
world war because you start to realize 

4575
04:26:33,571 --> 04:26:35,380
why that becomes important.
This is a very confusing story.

4576
04:26:35,500 --> 04:26:40,500
There's a lot going on.
It would be so easy to go off in the 

4577
04:26:40,500 --> 04:26:44,491
weeds and lose everybody.
I half the time worry about losing 

4578
04:26:44,491 --> 04:26:45,460
myself in the story.
You end up sticking to the western front

4579
04:26:45,461 --> 04:26:49,180
and Russia and the United States as a 
sort of an anchor to keep the story,

4580
04:26:49,860 --> 04:26:53,230
you know,
clinging to some sort of structure.

4581
04:26:54,340 --> 04:26:58,690
In some ways I think it's probably the 
week hosts answer to the problem.

4582
04:26:58,810 --> 04:27:03,810
On the other hand,
every time you introduce theater and 

4583
04:27:03,810 --> 04:27:07,131
another people and another in a region 
and more names and individuals,

4584
04:27:07,890 --> 04:27:09,960
you make the story more and more 
confusing.

4585
04:27:11,070 --> 04:27:15,000
The first world war is a giant topic.
What you're getting here,

4586
04:27:15,001 --> 04:27:16,890
and I say this about all of our 
productions,

4587
04:27:16,891 --> 04:27:19,830
don't I?
You're getting the Dan Carlin version of

4588
04:27:19,831 --> 04:27:23,850
the first world war and unfortunately 
that's leaving a lot of things out,

4589
04:27:23,851 --> 04:27:27,180
but I tell you what,
as a friend of mine once said,

4590
04:27:27,870 --> 04:27:32,870
perhaps we should look at it as just 
leaving a lot more potential future 

4591
04:27:32,870 --> 04:27:37,350
hardcore history topics available for us
to handle down the road.

4592
04:27:38,370 --> 04:27:43,370
In the next show,
we're going to make up some of the 

4593
04:27:43,370 --> 04:27:45,891
deficit for the things we haven't talked
about and make up for some lost time in 

4594
04:27:45,891 --> 04:27:49,491
the Middle East.
There are many things going on that 

4595
04:27:49,491 --> 04:27:49,670
create,
you know,

4596
04:27:49,671 --> 04:27:50,010
the,
the,

4597
04:27:50,020 --> 04:27:52,020
the beginnings of the modern world in 
that region,

4598
04:27:52,021 --> 04:27:57,021
including important foundational events 
that lay the groundwork for the modern 

4599
04:27:58,021 --> 04:28:03,021
recreation of the ancient state of 
Israel in that region in Russia.

4600
04:28:03,210 --> 04:28:08,210
We get to see what an intellectual 
contagion that might be a good way to 

4601
04:28:08,881 --> 04:28:13,770
describe it,
dropped down into the middle of the very

4602
04:28:13,770 --> 04:28:15,900
fertile petri dish that is provisional 
government,

4603
04:28:15,901 --> 04:28:20,901
Russia can do to a country like that in 
an answer to the question will perhaps 

4604
04:28:20,911 --> 04:28:25,911
arise as to whether or not an army can 
actually function if the soldiers get to

4605
04:28:26,071 --> 04:28:28,740
vote on whether they want to follow 
orders or not.

4606
04:28:29,940 --> 04:28:34,940
And finally,
we'll get to see the arrival of US 

4607
04:28:34,940 --> 04:28:37,920
troops in large numbers on the European 
continent.

4608
04:28:37,921 --> 04:28:41,250
For the first time ever,
if I'm lucky and get what I want,

4609
04:28:41,340 --> 04:28:46,340
we will get to delve a little bit into 
air power and how it's three 

4610
04:28:46,340 --> 04:28:50,661
dimensionalizing battlefields and how 
that technological race is a little 

4611
04:28:51,181 --> 04:28:51,820
like,
you know,

4612
04:28:51,850 --> 04:28:56,850
Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and those guys
were involved in technology back in 

4613
04:28:56,850 --> 04:28:58,410
1969,
1917.

4614
04:28:58,411 --> 04:29:02,550
They might very well be in airplane 
development geeks.

4615
04:29:03,330 --> 04:29:06,450
These pilots in these planes are,
you know,

4616
04:29:06,690 --> 04:29:10,410
half Technological Geek and half 
Medieval Knight.

4617
04:29:10,470 --> 04:29:13,830
We'll talk a bit about that if I get 
lucky and I can make the time.

4618
04:29:15,060 --> 04:29:20,060
And finally we'll talk certainly about 
the difference when both sides are 

4619
04:29:22,351 --> 04:29:27,351
exhausted on the western front,
that half a million to a million fresh 

4620
04:29:27,351 --> 04:29:32,271
troops can make,
and I'm not talking about American 

4621
04:29:32,271 --> 04:29:34,731
troops,
I'm talking about the German soldiers 

4622
04:29:34,731 --> 04:29:38,150
that arrive from the eastern front to 
the western front can make on tired 

4623
04:29:38,150 --> 04:29:43,101
French and British armies before the 
Americans arrive in enough numbers to 

4624
04:29:43,771 --> 04:29:48,771
make a difference.
The last year of the war is full of 

4625
04:29:48,841 --> 04:29:53,841
surprises.
All that and more on part six of 

4626
04:29:55,111 --> 04:29:56,460
blueprint for Armageddon.
