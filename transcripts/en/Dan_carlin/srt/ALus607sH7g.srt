1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,250
What you're about to hear is the sixth 
and final part of a six part series on 

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,400
the first world war.
Traditionally,

3
00:00:06,401 --> 00:00:08,290
we suggest people listen to them in 
order,

4
00:00:08,291 --> 00:00:13,291
but I realize not everyone's traditional
and there may be a few historical 

5
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:15,790
dyslexics out there,
and if that's the case,

6
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:17,980
it might not matter to you the order you
listen in.

7
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,070
If that's the case,
please feel free to jump right in.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,380
And for those of you who've heard the 
previous episodes,

9
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:26,860
welcome back to part six.
As we said,

10
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:31,861
the final part,
not counting an extra show of blueprint 

11
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:31,930
for Armageddon,

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,870
be some bus seven,
19,

13
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,930
41 date which will live in infamy.

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,380
Eats

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,530
quiet please.

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,820
The events

17
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,950
that dude the figure from this time and 
place,

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,790
I take pride in the words,
been the Alina,

19
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:19,690
tear down,
complete collapse.

20
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:27,900
Hi,
welcome.

21
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:32,901
This kind of examination because people 
have got to know whether or not their 

22
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:34,130
president question well,
I'm not a crop.

23
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,380
If we dig deep in our history and our 
doctrine and remember we are not 

24
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,710
descended from fearful of man.

25
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,030
It's hardcore history.

26
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,480
What's the most dangerous weapon in the 
world?

27
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,090
I've had this discussion many times with
many people and I've seen it go all over

28
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:05,091
the place,
but generally you focus on nuclear 

29
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,941
weapons because that's an obvious thing 
to put in the number one spot for most 

30
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:10,350
dangerous weapon in the world,
but there are some that are a little bit

31
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:12,210
more in city,
isn't potentially worse.

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,360
Take for example,
biological weapons.

33
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,490
Think about some of the worst plagues 
that have ever infested mankind.

34
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,730
Now imagine human ingenuity and a 
laboratory use to make such plagues 

35
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:30,120
worse and now imagine releasing those 
upon your enemy.

36
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,170
The reason they're so extra dangerous is
because of the way they spread and the 

37
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,900
fact that once you open the Pandora's 
box of biological warfare,

38
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:42,660
you generally lose the ability to shut 
the box.

39
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:47,661
Again,
you may exchange a few nuclear weapons 

40
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:50,781
with an opponent and decide to stop.
Once you open up that box and unleashed 

41
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,200
super small pox or what have you,
you can't turn that off.

42
00:02:55,201 --> 00:03:00,201
Again,
another reason it's very dangerous is 

43
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:02,781
that super smallpox doesn't 
differentiate between the people you 

44
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:04,690
targeted and everyone else that it may 
spread to.

45
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,930
It's a bit of a doomsday device.
When you think about how something like 

46
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:10,870
that could backfire on the very people 
who decide to use it,

47
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,260
it's a little like deciding to get rid 
of your next door neighbor in your 

48
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,400
apartment complex by burning down his 
place.

49
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,410
The potential for the fire to hurt you 
is very real,

50
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,020
but sometimes if you've run out of 
options,

51
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:31,021
gambling like that might make sense.
In late 1917 where we are in this story,

52
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:35,200
even though we've been using sliding 
timescale,

53
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:37,450
that's about where we are.
In late 1917,

54
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:42,451
the Germans are desperate enough to try 
all sorts of things including the 

55
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:46,921
equivalent of biological warfare,
but instead of using some sort of 

56
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:50,590
contagious disease,
they're using contagious ideas,

57
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,340
but you might be able to make a case 
that in this situation an actual disease

58
00:03:56,771 --> 00:03:57,850
would have been preferable.

59
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,510
Whenever I think about this idea,
I think about Napoleon,

60
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,480
the famous French emperor from late 17,
hundreds,

61
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:08,390
early 18 hundreds who was such a force 
in Europe.

62
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Napoleon was someone who spread and 
intellectual contagion and I remember 

63
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:18,980
professors in college suggesting that 
this was the thing that scared the kings

64
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:24,010
and czars and emperors of Europe the 
most about Napoleon because Napoleon 

65
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,910
arose in the wake of the French 
revolution,

66
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,160
the era where Frenchman were infused 
with these ideas of revolution,

67
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,040
of equality,
of Republican Ism,

68
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,310
all these things that seem in a 
relatively moderate to people today,

69
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:44,321
even beneficial,
but those were the scariest things on 

70
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:47,861
earth to people who were kings and 
emperors and czars and many of them 

71
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:51,761
figured that they would eventually be 
able to throw the French out of these 

72
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:55,511
territories and get their thrones back,
but they were less sure about their 

73
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:59,801
ability to cleanse their population of 
these dangerous radical ideas that 

74
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:02,000
French occupying troops had spread to 
them.

75
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,900
In fact,
many historians believe that the famous 

76
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,530
revolutionary period in the middle,
18 hundreds was the blossoming of seeds 

77
00:05:11,931 --> 00:05:16,931
that were planted by Napoleon's troops.
As they occupied all these countries 

78
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,810
talk to the locals and spread the 
equivalent of an intellectual contagion.

79
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,530
Of course,
if you're one of those types who would 

80
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,331
view the ideas of the American 
revolution or the French revolution or 

81
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:35,171
the ideas of the thinkers who helped 
prompt those revolutions as a negative 

82
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:37,580
thing than perhaps you would view the 18
hundreds as an example,

83
00:05:37,581 --> 00:05:40,130
not of a seed flowering into some 
wonderful plant,

84
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,550
but as a virus beginning to morph and 
mutate and evolve into new and maybe 

85
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:50,950
more dangerous forms.
The 18 hundreds is up until that time 

86
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,810
period,
almost certainly the greatest period for

87
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:59,140
intellectual examination of forms of 
that's ever existed and part of it is 

88
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,930
because of the increase in communication
and how people all over Europe can begin

89
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:07,931
to have conferences and discussions and 
write for magazines and newspapers that 

90
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:11,711
each other reeds and have all sorts of 
attempts at trying to apply rationality 

91
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,380
and logic to the idea of government.
Because most of the governments in a 

92
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,941
place like Europe at this time period 
are things that have existed in one form

93
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:26,840
or another for centuries.

94
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,860
You know,
some one in the distant past was a great

95
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:35,861
military leader who establishes a 
dynasty who rules for hundreds of years 

96
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:40,571
and no one ever really asks whether or 
not that's the right thing to do or 

97
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:40,580
whether or not it's smart or anything 
else.

98
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,590
In the 18 hundreds,
people began to think along with changes

99
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:50,591
in science and all kinds of different 
things that may be people could come up 

100
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:54,911
with smarter approaches,
but there was wide disagreement though 

101
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:58,961
on what that smart approach might be and
some of the great figures of the 18 

102
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:02,831
hundreds who played roles in this would 
become extremely important figures in 

103
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:04,820
the 19 hundreds.
In fact,

104
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:10,150
someone who was involved in trying to 
come up with a system that seemed to be 

105
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,141
an improvement over what Europe was 
living with in the 18 hundreds explodes 

106
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:18,431
in importance in 1917 exactly where we 
are in this first world war story.

107
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,270
He was renowned in his own day within 
his own circles,

108
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:25,980
but he certainly wasn't a household 
name.

109
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,400
He becomes a historical superstar in 
1917 and there's a little bit of irony.

110
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:36,090
Did that because in 1917,
this figure has been dead 34,

111
00:07:36,091 --> 00:07:37,260
35 years,

112
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,370
one of the best or one of the worst 
aspects of an idea,

113
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,620
depending on whether you consider a good
or dangerous,

114
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,920
is the fact that it doesn't die with the
originator.

115
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,480
In 1917,
all of a sudden everybody starts hearing

116
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:58,481
the name.
Karl Marx marks is often credited with 

117
00:07:58,481 --> 00:08:02,971
being the originator of modern communism
or Marxism,

118
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,910
but I think that's probably giving him a
little too much credit after all,

119
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:12,180
very few people come up with ideas out 
of nowhere and marked like most people 

120
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:15,250
stood on the shoulders of giants with 
his ideas.

121
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,190
He was reading guys like the German 
philosopher,

122
00:08:18,191 --> 00:08:19,930
Hegel and a lot of other people,

123
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,540
but if a guy like,
hey,

124
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:27,541
goals and example of the intellectual 
contagion than mark's is an example of 

125
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:32,481
someone who mutated it further,
and of course perhaps the ironic tragedy

126
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:39,411
of marks is that Marx didn't get to be 
the implementer of his ideas.

127
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,900
His ideas were adapted and morphed into 
different forms.

128
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,580
Like many figures from history.
If you could go back and show Karl Marx 

129
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,310
how he's treated in the history books 
and the things associated with,

130
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,910
I think he might jump off a bridge.
There's a lot of figures like that who 

131
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,231
are remembered for things that are 
almost a 180 degrees different than what

132
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:11,871
they devoted their lives to.
Working for Marx thought he was doing 

133
00:09:11,871 --> 00:09:14,811
good and yet today we think about his 
role in the deaths of tens of millions 

134
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,320
of people and the creation of some of 
the worst slave states in all human 

135
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,371
history.
If you read Marx and find out what he 

136
00:09:25,371 --> 00:09:29,991
was all about,
that's exactly what he was hoping to 

137
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:34,010
prevent and stop and eliminate.
He could bring Carl Marx back from the 

138
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,370
dead and have him analyze where things 
went wrong.

139
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,670
I wouldn't be surprised at all if he 
blamed a botched implementation for the 

140
00:09:44,181 --> 00:09:49,181
way things turned out.
We might argue that Marx's ideas from 

141
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:52,091
the get go were poor,
but I think he would probably say that 

142
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,031
you never got a chance to see what he 
wanted because he wasn't the guy that 

143
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:56,030
built the house.
He was the architect.

144
00:09:56,031 --> 00:09:58,610
May Be or maybe the last guy to design 
blueprints.

145
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,710
The guy who actually built the dwelling 
was a guy named Vladimir Lenin

146
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,480
and I'm reminded of a quote by the 
writer,

147
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:12,481
Algiers Huxley,
about how ideas end up influencing 

148
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:17,311
people and it's not so much a question 
always of how many people but who they 

149
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:19,580
are.
Huxley wrote quote,

150
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,800
it is possible to argue that the really 
influential book is not that which 

151
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,001
converts 10 millions of casual readers,
but rather that which converts the very 

152
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,350
few who at any given moment succeed in 
seizing power marks and sorrel have been

153
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:40,351
influential in the modern world,
not so much because they were best 

154
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:41,800
sellers,
but because among their few readers were

155
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:46,801
two men called respectively Lennon and 
Mussolini and quote

156
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,960
Vladimir Lenin is the hinge point 
between theory and application.

157
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,470
When it comes to modern day communism,
he's the implementer.

158
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:03,471
If mark's is the originator than Lennon 
is the implementer and he's a figure 

159
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:08,630
that combines some rather unusual 
qualities in one human being.

160
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,240
Oftentimes the intellectual and the deep
thinker and the philosopher is a 

161
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,770
different sort of human being than the 
person of action.

162
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:18,210
Right?
You've heard of the man of action,

163
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,030
and oftentimes there are two different 
kinds of people.

164
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:24,630
Lenin is one of these strange 
individuals that possesses the qualities

165
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:27,570
of both an intellectual and a person of 
action,

166
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:33,290
and his dynamic abilities were 
recognized even by the people who were 

167
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,430
his opponents and take for example the 
description of Lloyd George,

168
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:43,431
the man who is the prime minister of 
Britain during the second half of the 

169
00:11:43,431 --> 00:11:47,181
first world war,
George will write his memoirs in the 

170
00:11:47,181 --> 00:11:49,210
Nineteen Thirties and he will say this 
of Latimer Lennon quote,

171
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,860
he was a communist,
but Wilson fanaticism does not always 

172
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,140
endow it's possessor with great 
administrative ability.

173
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,880
It is not incompatible with a genius for
government and no one can doubt that.

174
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:05,881
Lennon was one of the greatest leaders 
of men ever thrown up in any epic and 

175
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:05,881
the quote.

176
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,200
He then goes on to compare him to what 
he calls a plague.

177
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:12,000
Bacillus.

178
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,090
Lenin was certainly a fanatic.
Most revolutionaries are people who tend

179
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:21,580
to not see too many shades of gray 
things,

180
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:26,581
tend to be black and white.
Winston Churchill famously defined a 

181
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:29,950
fanatic is someone who can't change 
their mind and won't change the subject,

182
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,720
and Churchill had his own opinion of 
Lenin and once again it evoked this idea

183
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:39,721
of an intellectual contagion.
He also compared len into some sort of 

184
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:43,531
bacteria and he blamed the Germans for 
unleashing it on Europe,

185
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,640
playing an active role in implementing a
form of germ warfare that would have 

186
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,590
horrible effects down the road.
Churchill wrote,

187
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,620
quote,
Lennon was sent into Russia by the 

188
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,291
Germans in the same way that you might 
send a file containing a culture of 

189
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:08,310
typhoid or Colorado to be poured in the 
water supply of a great city and it 

190
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:13,351
worked with amazing accuracy and quote.
That brings us to the third person who 

191
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:19,681
was very important in implementing this 
intellectual contagion.

192
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,710
Warfare kind of approach.
The facilitator.

193
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,040
If march is the originator and linen is 
the implementer,

194
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:32,050
Lennon needed some help to get to the 
point where he could.

195
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,730
In fact,
if you will,

196
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
anyone in the beginning of 1917,
Vladimir Lenin is in exile.

197
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,200
He's living in Switzerland,
next to a sausage factory on the second 

198
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,181
floor of a rented flat with his wife 
trying to make a living in what you 

199
00:13:52,091 --> 00:13:55,840
might call the professional 
revolutionary business.

200
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,800
He'd like to get back to Russia in 1917 
because it's apparent that huge things 

201
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,100
are happening in Russia.
The czar has been overthrown.

202
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:08,101
A provisional government is taken over,
but Lenin can't get from where he is to 

203
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:11,350
Russia.
There's a war going on and there's a lot

204
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,350
of territory in between Switzerland and 
Russia to deal with,

205
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,780
and then he gets some help from the 
facilitator,

206
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,300
the leader of Germany's military,
and for the most part by this time,

207
00:14:25,301 --> 00:14:27,700
civilian government,
Eric Luton,

208
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:31,350
Dorf Ludin

209
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,020
door from the Germans have long been 
associated with Lennon's rise to power.

210
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,500
The exact amount of responsibility that 
Germany has in that story is debatable 

211
00:14:42,741 --> 00:14:47,741
and has been debated since 1917.
One of the reasons historians have a 

212
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:53,411
hard time nailing down definitive 
answers is because it's one of those 

213
00:14:53,411 --> 00:14:58,151
things that falls into the category of 
what we would call today covert 

214
00:14:58,151 --> 00:15:02,600
operations or black ops top secret 
stuff,

215
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:07,601
both sides in the war.
We're trying to undermine the 

216
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:10,811
cohesiveness and the stability of their 
opponents and it potentially wonderful 

217
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:16,091
way to do that was to give money or arms
or sometimes military advisors to 

218
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:21,761
revolutionaries and insurrectionists and
break away groups and ethnic separatists

219
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,630
and people who lived in countries that 
were colonies of some of the great 

220
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,931
powers,
but who wanted their independence and 

221
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:31,931
both sides.
As I said,

222
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,691
we're doing this.
There's a lot of allegations about 

223
00:15:34,691 --> 00:15:35,330
German involvement.
For example,

224
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,200
in the famous Easter rising in 1916 in 
Ireland,

225
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,350
how much German support.
That's questionable too,

226
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:46,040
and part of the reason why is nobody was
exactly advertising.

227
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Now these top secret affairs,
most of the stories trace German 

228
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:55,890
involvement at least as far back as 
1915.

229
00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,790
Most of those stories suggests that it 
was contacts with leftist individuals 

230
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,141
who pointed out to the German government
that there were shared goals on the part

231
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:10,140
of Germany and some of these Russian 
revolutionary figures

232
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,990
take,
for example,

233
00:16:12,991 --> 00:16:16,260
Lennon and his particular offshoot of 
the Communist,

234
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,720
you know,
mainstream known as the Bolsheviks.

235
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,010
One of the things Lennon was calling for
was peace.

236
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,400
That's exactly what the Germans wanted 
from the Russians.

237
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:30,420
By 1917,
they wanted the Russians out of the war.

238
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:36,610
The Russians were tying down millions of
German troops on the eastern front that 

239
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:41,591
the Germans would love to be able to 
switch over to the western front to 

240
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:43,940
fight the exhausted French and British 
before the Americans arrived in any sort

241
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:46,430
of decisive numbers.
Now,

242
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:50,060
the big gamble here of course,
is that the Bolsheviks,

243
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:54,980
while they may share a common goal in 
getting Russia to leave the war,

244
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,640
are not Germany's friends,
Luton Dorf deciding to use them as a 

245
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,961
tool,
is akin to adding another boxer into the

246
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,200
World War One.
Boxing match.

247
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,600
We've used that analogy throughout this 
series.

248
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:10,610
The idea of two boxers fighting each 
other.

249
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:16,090
Part of Lewandowski gamble here is he.
He's talking about introducing a third 

250
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:20,681
box or into the ring,
one that wants to fight both the other 

251
00:17:20,681 --> 00:17:24,191
two boxers,
but Luton Dorf has a pretty good idea 

252
00:17:24,191 --> 00:17:26,780
that he'll go after the one Ludin door 
from the Germans are fighting first,

253
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:33,090
the Bolsheviks and Lennon or preaching 
the equivalent of a global civil war.

254
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,720
If the American president,
Woodrow Wilson is calling the first 

255
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,360
world war,
the war to end all wars,

256
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,810
Lennon has his own idea of the war to 
end all wars is Irish historian William 

257
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:50,640
Mulligan points out Lennon's idea of the
war to end all is revolutionary war.

258
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,240
The Bolsheviks are calling for the poor 
and the working classes of all nations 

259
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,840
to rise up and overthrow their rulers.
Germany is only a little less vulnerable

260
00:18:02,841 --> 00:18:04,760
to that sort of message.
Then Russia is.

261
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,330
This is why Ludina Dorf is playing with 
fire,

262
00:18:08,331 --> 00:18:13,331
or in this case play.
He stands a really good chance of 

263
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:17,861
getting burned by this very same weapon 
that he in 1917 decides to help use 

264
00:18:19,761 --> 00:18:24,761
against Russia.
The actual means to get Lennon from 

265
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,960
Switzerland back to Russia is provided 
by the Germans in April 19,

266
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:31,940
17.
So we're going backwards a little bit in

267
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:32,570
this story.

268
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,940
The Germans provide a single sealed 
train car for Lennon and his cohorts.

269
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,370
Historians have disagreed over who had 
demanded that EBC yield.

270
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:51,730
Some say the Germans wanted this train 
car sealed so that when Lennon and his 

271
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,211
cohorts are going through Germany,
they don't intellectually infect the 

272
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:58,541
Germans on the way through.
Others say it was Lenin and the 

273
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,541
Bolsheviks who demanded it.
The last thing that they wanted was to 

274
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,950
have people in Russia find out that they
were accepting help from the country.

275
00:19:03,951 --> 00:19:05,990
Russia was fighting.
Oh yeah.

276
00:19:05,991 --> 00:19:10,991
And uh,
people who happen to be capitalists to 

277
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:12,860
nonetheless,
whomever it was who made the decision as

278
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:17,861
the train car goes through Germany,
there's a famous incident where Lennon 

279
00:19:17,861 --> 00:19:20,981
or one of his cohorts looks out the 
window and happens to notice that there 

280
00:19:20,981 --> 00:19:25,361
are no mature men anywhere to be seen.
It's children and women and old people.

281
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,160
Germany's mature male population is 
either dead or wounded or at the fronts,

282
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:40,410
Lennon in his party.
Then we'll have to board a ferry and go 

283
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,860
by boat for a little bit.
Then they'll get back on another train.

284
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,780
The train will then arrive in Petrograd,
formerly St Petersburg,

285
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:50,020
the Russian capital just before midnight
on April 16th,

286
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:54,010
1917.
There will be a crowd waiting to welcome

287
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:57,550
him because like many other dangerous 
radicals,

288
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,870
Lenin is coming home from exile.
The Tsar for decades had been exiled and

289
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:07,871
all these very formidable intellectual 
contagions and those are the ones he 

290
00:20:08,111 --> 00:20:09,700
wasn't executing.
By the way,

291
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:12,220
Lennon's brother had been executed by 
the czar.

292
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,640
Now all these people were coming back to
Russia at roughly the same time creating

293
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:22,681
a seditious soup politically speaking in
Russia during this time period and 

294
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:24,910
believe me,
Russia was ready for it.

295
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,790
They're in this precarious situation 
after the czar falls where you have sort

296
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:35,791
of a moderate government.
I'm known as the provisional government 

297
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:40,261
sharing power with these groups of 
soldiers and peasants and workers who 

298
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:46,051
have gotten together and elected leaders
and who are sort of trying to lead from 

299
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:50,341
the bottom and they're sharing power and
not very comfortable sort of an 

300
00:20:50,341 --> 00:20:51,010
arrangement with the provisional 
government.

301
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,460
It is absolutely a setup for problems 
and yet you kind of have to feel a 

302
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:58,180
little bit for them.
I mean,

303
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:00,400
think about what these people are trying
to do.

304
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:05,730
They are trying to run a country after 
toppling the regime that had been in 

305
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:11,701
power for centuries.
This is a tough thing to do in the best 

306
00:21:11,701 --> 00:21:14,020
of times,
but this isn't the best of times.

307
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:19,170
This is the equivalent of a bus 
passenger trying to get ahold of the 

308
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,291
wheel when the bus is already careening 
off a cliff and then you get a guy like 

309
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:26,050
lennon arriving and he gets off the 
platform at a little before midnight and

310
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,420
tells this enthusiastic crowd of 
supporters.

311
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,740
The periodical imperialist war is the 
beginning of a civil war throughout 

312
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,331
Europe.
The worldwide socialist revolution has 

313
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,200
already dawned,
Germany is seizing any day now.

314
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:43,870
The whole of European capitalism may 
crash.

315
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,700
Sailors,
comrades.

316
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,880
We have to fight for a socialist 
revolution to fight until the 

317
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,151
proletariat winds fold victory long live
the worldwide socialist revolution and 

318
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:59,930
quote,
even Lennon's friends thought this way 

319
00:22:00,461 --> 00:22:03,370
too optimistic.
In fact,

320
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:08,850
at that very moment,
the current Russian government power 

321
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,781
sharing arrangement was trying to put 
together and offensive against the 

322
00:22:12,781 --> 00:22:17,401
Germans scheduled for July first with an
army that was sketchy at best.

323
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:24,871
At this point,
if you are Russia's provisional 

324
00:22:24,871 --> 00:22:25,660
government,
you are between a rock and a hard place.

325
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:29,290
In 1917,
you are barely holding onto power.

326
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,510
You have strikes,
you have unrest,

327
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:36,511
you have all kinds of problems,
and now you have lennon here taking the 

328
00:22:36,511 --> 00:22:39,991
already kind of extreme bolsheviks and 
pushing them into greater extremism.

329
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:45,930
He's calling for three main things that 
are impossible for the provisional 

330
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,190
government to really contend with.
He is calling for peace,

331
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:53,550
bread and land,
a triple threat of a message that would 

332
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:58,351
be effective across much of Europe in 
1917 and you have the provisional 

333
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:00,370
government,
oh,

334
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:06,510
it has to prove to the British and the 
French that it's still a viable partner 

335
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:06,510
in this war.

336
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,100
They're funneling tons of subsidies to 
this government.

337
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:14,910
In fact,
they need to convince the Germans and 

338
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,200
the central powers of the same fact that
you can't just assume we're done and the

339
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:19,390
best way to do that is to launch and 
attack.

340
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,080
The problem is is that this army might 
have been willing to stay and defend 

341
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,600
mother Russia soil,
but most of them are not willing to go 

342
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,561
on the offensive and run into the 
machine guns and artillery barrages of 

343
00:23:34,561 --> 00:23:38,311
the Germans.
They may not give a hoot about 

344
00:23:38,311 --> 00:23:41,590
bolshevism or communism or any of that,
but they understand peace,

345
00:23:41,591 --> 00:23:45,620
bread and land.
On July first,

346
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:51,190
the Curran ski offensive visits 
sometimes called with the July 

347
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,671
offensive,
led by the great Russian general Brazil 

348
00:23:54,671 --> 00:23:57,700
of launches,
an attack on a wide front against the 

349
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,211
Germans and the Austra Hungarians.
It becomes a disaster.

350
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,180
This is the way historian Peter Harte 
describes it,

351
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,560
quote,
after a two day bombardment,

352
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,710
the second bruce,
a love offensive attack began with a 

353
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,410
flourish with the attack of the Russian 
seventh and 11th armies on the southwest

354
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,520
front.
When the infantry went over the top on 

355
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:18,560
first July,
early results were promising,

356
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,830
but then everything started to go wrong.
The best and most loyal units had been 

357
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:27,761
chosen as the assault troops.
While the follow up and reserve 

358
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:28,850
formations were far less committed,
indeed,

359
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,660
when it came to moving forwards,
many regimens simply refused.

360
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,930
The attack petered out in ignominy and 
further plan to were either canceled or 

361
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,660
abandoned.
Then a vigorous austro-hungarian counter

362
00:24:40,661 --> 00:24:43,610
offensive was launched at Ternopil in 
Galicia.

363
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:48,610
On Nineteenth July,
the Russians broke and retreated in 

364
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:52,001
chaos.
This disaster triggered the replacement 

365
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:53,300
of brucellosis commander in chief by 
General Cornell Law.

366
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:58,330
On the first of August,
the Russian army was falling apart and 

367
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,111
such attacks as had been carried out,
only serve to call the few remaining 

368
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:06,191
loyalist units,
still willing to actively prosecute the 

369
00:25:06,191 --> 00:25:09,131
war.
The vast majority of Russian soldiers 

370
00:25:09,131 --> 00:25:09,320
were now content to be passive 
observers.

371
00:25:09,321 --> 00:25:13,850
At best indeed by the autumn,
it was estimated that some 2 million had

372
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:18,851
deserted and quote for a while the 
German high command in the 

373
00:25:19,341 --> 00:25:24,341
Austro-hungarian high commanding courage
their troops to fraternize with Russian 

374
00:25:24,341 --> 00:25:26,780
troops to sort of undermine their 
willingness to fight.

375
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:32,080
They stopped doing that when they found 
out that the Russian troops were 

376
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,711
spreading socialist and Bolshevik 
propaganda back to the German and 

377
00:25:35,711 --> 00:25:37,730
Austro-hungarian troops.
Nonetheless,

378
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:43,060
what that disaster at the current ski 
offensive did was essentially proved 

379
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:48,641
that Russia's army was done and opened 
the door even more to the Bolshevik 

380
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:56,230
message calling for peace writer Gj 
Meyer describes a letter from Rudolf 

381
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,620
Hess,
who in the next World War will be one of

382
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:08,621
Hitler's henchmen,
writing back to his parents about what 

383
00:26:08,621 --> 00:26:11,000
the Russians are doing opposite the 
German lines.

384
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,180
They're basically fighting amongst 
themselves.

385
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,360
He writes,
quote yesterday,

386
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:21,200
we saw heavy fighting,
but only among the Russians themselves.

387
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,930
A Russian officer came over and gave 
himself up.

388
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,140
He spoke perfect German.
He was born in bodden,

389
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:32,230
but he's a Russian citizen.
He told us that whole battles are going 

390
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,831
on behind their lines.
Their officers are shooting each other 

391
00:26:35,831 --> 00:26:38,090
and the soldiers are doing the same.
He founded all too ridiculous.

392
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,790
They can all get lost as far as he's 
concerned.

393
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,070
We invited him to eat with us and he 
thanked us.

394
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,070
He ate well

395
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,380
and drank plenty of tea before going 
off.

396
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,840
There was a lot of noise coming from the
Russian side.

397
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:53,841
Yesterday.
They were fighting each other in the 

398
00:26:53,841 --> 00:26:56,121
trenches.
We also heard shots coming from their 

399
00:26:56,121 --> 00:26:56,190
infantry,
but they were firing at each other,

400
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:01,430
charming and cooled.
Lenin said that the Russian soldiers 

401
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:08,631
were voting for peace with their feet.
The failure of the July offensive was 

402
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:14,601
another nail in the coffin for the 
provisional government and added to the 

403
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:18,651
support of Lenin and the Bolsheviks who 
were able to portray themselves as the 

404
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,270
real alternative to the provisional 
government,

405
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:24,750
the one party that didn't have any 
responsibility and what was going on,

406
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:27,180
and the more Russians didn't like what 
was going on.

407
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,510
The more the only choice to change that 
seemed to be the bolsheviks.

408
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:35,511
And over the months between the February
revolution that toppled the czar and 

409
00:27:35,511 --> 00:27:40,041
just about November,
the Bolsheviks increased their support 

410
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:44,510
in these councils of peasants and 
soldiers and workers known as the 

411
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:44,510
Soviets.

412
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,990
And on November seventh,
19,

413
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:50,991
17,
they moved in a triumph of superior 

414
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:56,421
organization.
They were able to take over the most 

415
00:27:56,421 --> 00:28:00,051
important government buildings in the 
Russian capital in a coup that most 

416
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:04,650
Russians awoke to find a fait accompli 
already finished.

417
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:10,250
And the most radical government in power
in a major state since the French 

418
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,490
revolution.
All of a sudden,

419
00:28:14,491 --> 00:28:19,491
Lenin and the Bolsheviks were in charge 
of Russia and marks and the other 19th 

420
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:27,831
century thinkers we're about to have 
their ideas updated,

421
00:28:28,021 --> 00:28:29,160
evolved,
morphed,

422
00:28:29,161 --> 00:28:34,161
and changed,
put into practice in what was about to 

423
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:37,671
become a giant human experiment,
but to most of old Europe,

424
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,520
this looked like a human experiment 
conducted by a mad scientist to them.

425
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:48,801
It looked like the second coming of the 
French revolution and Lenin and the 

426
00:28:48,801 --> 00:28:50,040
Bolsheviks might as well have been 
jacobins.

427
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,120
How long before the guillotines are 
brought out and everyone starts getting 

428
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,120
their head chopped off.

429
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:02,390
Within 24 or so hours of taking power,
Lennon starts to make good on some of 

430
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:07,851
his promises.
Understand though Lennon's promises had 

431
00:29:07,851 --> 00:29:11,181
a tactical purpose in mind,
they would end up in his mind helping to

432
00:29:11,311 --> 00:29:14,520
spread the revolution to other 
countries.

433
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:20,300
The fire caused by German General Ludin 
doors attempt to burn down his 

434
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:25,881
neighbor's apartment.
We're beginning to fan the flames to a 

435
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:29,991
degree where many other countries,
we're likely to get burned Lennon's 

436
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:33,030
decree on land set.
Among other things,

437
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:38,300
quote,
private ownership of land shall be 

438
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,001
abolished forever.
All land shall become the property of 

439
00:29:41,001 --> 00:29:44,691
the whole people and into the use of 
those who cultivated and cooled.

440
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:51,300
Then Lennon started spreading the sort 
of propaganda that most horrified the 

441
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,640
powers who had been fighting the first 
world war for more than three years.

442
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:55,720
By this point,
he said,

443
00:29:55,721 --> 00:30:00,721
quote,
we shall offer piece for the peoples of 

444
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:03,040
all the belligerent countries upon the 
basis of the Soviet terms,

445
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,890
no annexations,
no indemnities,

446
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,650
and the right of self determination of 
peoples.

447
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,290
At the same time,
according to our promise,

448
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,440
we shall publish and repudiate the 
secret treaties and quote the secret 

449
00:30:17,051 --> 00:30:22,051
treaties were the treaties amongst the 
allied powers that were in the files of 

450
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:27,661
the winter palace and the Bolsheviks had
just taken over by making what was in 

451
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:34,051
those files public.
The Bolsheviks were pulling the 

452
00:30:34,051 --> 00:30:37,990
wikileaks maneuver or the Edward Snowden
disclosure of their day.

453
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,580
By the way,
another similarity to the release of the

454
00:30:42,581 --> 00:30:45,760
secret treaties and the Wiki leaks,
Edward Snowden,

455
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:50,920
revelations of,
of the more modern era are the newspaper

456
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:53,680
in Britain that released the information
to British readers.

457
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,090
It was the Manchester Guardian that 
published in Britain.

458
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,590
The secret treaty information that Leon 
Trotsky,

459
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,330
the Bolsheviks,
released to the world,

460
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:09,780
that's the same newspaper in Britain 
that took the lead almost 100 years 

461
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,981
later in revealing the Edward snowden 
revelations as historians Michael Nyberg

462
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:20,461
and David Jordan,
right in their history of the eastern 

463
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,221
front in the first world war quote,
the Bolshevik leaders had little 

464
00:31:23,221 --> 00:31:25,480
interest in working with the capitalist 
Western allies.

465
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:30,810
They soon publish the text of the secret
treaties and diplomatic understandings 

466
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,610
that they found in the winter palace and
the government archives.

467
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:38,940
These agreements showed French and 
British support for Russian territorial 

468
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,961
gain,
especially at Turkey's expense with 

469
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:45,481
regard to Constantinople.
This seemingly revealed with the 

470
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:48,781
Bolsheviks had been arguing all along,
namely that the war had been fought for 

471
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,830
imperial interests,
not out of self defense.

472
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:56,160
The publication of these terms 
embarrassed ally diplomats who had 

473
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,220
claimed in public that no such 
agreements existed.

474
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:02,580
This also anchored the Americans who had
advocated a piece without annexations 

475
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:07,170
and quote,
the new Bolshevik government began to 

476
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:12,780
tell generals along the entire front 
with the Germans and Hungarians and 

477
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:17,010
Turks,
that they should start making local 

478
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:17,860
peace treaties.
They called for an armistice for 30 days

479
00:32:17,861 --> 00:32:20,470
along the entire front.
All of a sudden,

480
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,530
Russia was in the process of dropping 
out of the war.

481
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:29,970
Lenin is supposed to have said a famous 
quote that aptly describes the situation

482
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:32,200
in November 19,
17.

483
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:32,830
He said,
quote,

484
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:38,220
there are decades when nothing happens 
and there are weeks when decades happen 

485
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,980
and quote and

486
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,070
look at the change in fortune for him 
personally.

487
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:49,030
Six or seven months ago,
he's living in a rented flat on the 

488
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:52,820
second floor next to a sausage factory 
in Switzerland.

489
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,670
Now by November 19,
17,

490
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,990
he's basically the guy in charge of the 
largest nation on earth,

491
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:05,860
but this leadership is not uncontested.
A Russian civil war starts almost 

492
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:10,391
immediately with the people who opposed 
Lenin and the Bolsheviks and it will go 

493
00:33:10,391 --> 00:33:14,681
on for several years and be terribly 
bloody and drawing the great powers as 

494
00:33:14,681 --> 00:33:17,090
well.
It also will not include $50,

495
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:21,980
million or more people who are counted 
as the citizens of old Russia as some of

496
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:24,980
these territories begin to break away 
from Russia.

497
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:30,550
Again,
one of the really dangerous things that 

498
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,880
the new Bolshevik government professes 
is a belief in self determination.

499
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,560
Well,
there are lots of different peoples who 

500
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:38,560
didn't want to be a part of the Russian 
government,

501
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,100
perhaps the fins,
the Poles,

502
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,400
the Ukrainians and others who were 
starting to think maybe they would just 

503
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:45,400
leave.

504
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:51,100
They were far from the only peoples who 
were members of larger state entities 

505
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:56,420
around the world who thought that they 
would like a crack itself determination.

506
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,200
All these European countries that had 
colonies were in the same position and 

507
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,091
there was no message more dangerous than
the idea that the time had come to 

508
00:34:07,091 --> 00:34:11,441
perhaps allow all these people to decide
for themselves whether they wanted to 

509
00:34:11,441 --> 00:34:15,971
stay colonies already the plague 
bacillus begins to spread and 

510
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:21,701
threatened,
not just the allies and the entente 

511
00:34:21,701 --> 00:34:24,581
powers,
but soon the powers that made it 

512
00:34:24,581 --> 00:34:26,870
possible for Lenin to get back and start
the fire in Russia to begin with.

513
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:33,130
This is the point in the story where 
Russia and communism veer off into their

514
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:37,730
own tail,
a very long,

515
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:41,510
complex tale that impacts the rest of 
the 20th century.

516
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:46,511
You can easily make the case that 
perhaps the most important longterm 

517
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,590
effect of the first world war is the 
collapse of the Russian czar,

518
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,770
an eventual replacement by the 
bolsheviks.

519
00:34:55,670 --> 00:35:00,670
It will eventually lead to Joseph Stalin
and the horrors of the Gulag and the 

520
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:07,420
Cold War.
There was a wonderfully prophetic line 

521
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,600
around the time of Karl Marx,
so you can see how long before this time

522
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:15,440
period that revolutionary thinkers like 
Bakunin,

523
00:35:15,441 --> 00:35:20,441
we're saying quote,
if you took the most ardent 

524
00:35:20,441 --> 00:35:22,040
revolutionary vested him in absolute 
power,

525
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,160
within a year,
he would be worse than the tsar himself 

526
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,180
and quote and for all his high minded 
rhetoric,

527
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,600
very quickly,
Vladimir Lenin was proving Bakunin 

528
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,230
right.
But in late 19,

529
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,040
17,
early

530
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,040
1918,
that side of the Bolsheviks and the 

531
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,671
communist regime in Russia was still 
debatable and unknown.

532
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,010
If you actually read their public 
pronouncements,

533
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,310
they look like an almost.
And,

534
00:35:52,311 --> 00:35:53,040
and you know,
in,

535
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,570
in hindsight,
this sounds terrible,

536
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:59,571
but almost a refreshing group of 
idealists who refuse to play by the old 

537
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:01,740
cynical,
hard bitten,

538
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,290
you know,
rules of the European powers.

539
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:10,430
And to get an idea of how difficult it 
is to figure out what's going on there 

540
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:14,841
and what these people are like.
You can look at diaries written during 

541
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:17,340
the time period where people try to make
sense of what they're seeing in Russia.

542
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,780
Take for example,
Evelyn,

543
00:36:18,781 --> 00:36:21,300
Princess Blue Cheer and we've talked 
about her before.

544
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:26,301
She's an English,
a wife of a German nobleman living in 

545
00:36:26,301 --> 00:36:30,201
Germany,
and she kept a diary that's often 

546
00:36:30,201 --> 00:36:31,680
referred to to give sort of an 
impression of what's going on in Germany

547
00:36:31,681 --> 00:36:32,510
and the feelings that they have.

548
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,920
And she writes about this new government
in Russia.

549
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,360
While the peace negotiations to end the 
war in the east are going on,

550
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:44,930
those negotiations will end up with one 
of the most one sided treaties and all 

551
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:45,280
history.
It's called [inaudible].

552
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:50,870
And the only reason it's so one sided is
that the bolsheviks were in such danger 

553
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:53,070
of getting overthrown before they had 
consolidated power.

554
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,670
That eventually they just agree to one 
of the worst deals of all time.

555
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,940
Assuming that the communist revolution 
is soon going to come and sweep all 

556
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,960
these western European governments and 
central European governments away.

557
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,990
Anyway,
so who cares what they agree to during 

558
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:11,910
the negotiations?
Leon Trotsky and a man we've also quoted

559
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:14,310
earlier,
a key figure in the Bolshevik government

560
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:18,090
is negotiating this deal and blue shirt 
writes in her diary.

561
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:23,150
In January in 1918,
the breast litoff's negotiation seemed 

562
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:28,491
likely to come to nothing as Trotsky 
seems to be playing a double part and 

563
00:37:28,491 --> 00:37:32,991
people say he's only toying with the 
central powers to be better able to sow 

564
00:37:32,991 --> 00:37:36,120
the seeds of sedition and rebellion 
amongst the West European peoples.

565
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,420
They say that already the German 
prisoners had been set free in Russia 

566
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:45,080
and that common soldiers are being 
placed in command over their former 

567
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,750
officers.
She continues quote,

568
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,660
there are many different opinions about 
Trotsky here,

569
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:53,790
some calling him a dreamer and idealist,
others abusing him as a blood thirsty.

570
00:37:53,791 --> 00:37:58,791
Tyrant wills.
There was a whole class of admirers who 

571
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:01,761
declare him to be the greatest man since
Christ lived upon the earth and the 

572
00:38:01,761 --> 00:38:05,721
profit of a new religion,
which is to regenerate mankind and 

573
00:38:05,721 --> 00:38:07,740
create a new paradise after the delusion
of the war.

574
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:13,010
Who knows what part this man may be 
going to play in the future fates of 

575
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:16,491
Europe,
some 120 years ago people were saying 

576
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:19,281
almost the same things have a certain 
unknown little officer who out of the 

577
00:38:19,281 --> 00:38:23,511
reign of terror and bloodshed developed 
into the vampire emperor who almost 

578
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:26,980
succeeded in draining the blood of all 
Europe and quote.

579
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:28,740
She,
of course,

580
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:33,741
is referencing Napoleon who grew out of 
the French revolution to people at the 

581
00:38:33,741 --> 00:38:38,301
time period.
That's what the revolution in Russia 

582
00:38:38,301 --> 00:38:40,060
kind of resembled and there are quite a 
few similarities that are pointed out by

583
00:38:40,061 --> 00:38:45,061
various historians between the French 
Revolution and the Napoleonic era and 

584
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:46,810
the era when the bolsheviks take charge 
in Russia.

585
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:52,020
Take for example,
one of the stipulations that the 

586
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,820
Bolsheviks were making during the peace 
negotiations at Bressler task.

587
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:59,100
They wanted their troops to have the 
right during the negotiations to 

588
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:03,031
fraternize with the German and Austrian 
Hungarian soldiers on the other side of 

589
00:39:03,031 --> 00:39:04,780
no man's land.
Why did they want that?

590
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:09,520
Because they felt that just like 
Napoleon's troops spreading the ideas,

591
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:13,390
the intellectual contagion,
the sedition of the French revolutionary

592
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:18,391
ideas to the lands of the kings and 
Czars and emperors in,

593
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,190
you know,
18th and early 19th century Europe,

594
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:26,430
the Bolsheviks assumed that their troops
would do the same thing to the Germans 

595
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:30,211
and the ostrow Hungarians in early 20th 
century Europe combined that with the 

596
00:39:30,221 --> 00:39:35,221
impact that the release of the secret 
treaty agreements was having and the 

597
00:39:35,221 --> 00:39:36,640
Russian government,
the new Russian government,

598
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,500
the idealistic,
at least on the surface,

599
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:43,501
new Russian government was doing amazing
damage to the allied war effort by 

600
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:46,930
undercutting all the propaganda and they
had a help.

601
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:51,930
By the way.
The other really idealistic power that 

602
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:54,070
was starting to have an impact on the 
world scene was across the Atlantic.

603
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,190
It was the United States and to the hard
bitten,

604
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:01,960
cynical Bismarckian,
real politic Europe of that day.

605
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:05,950
It would have been hard for them to 
decide who was more idealistic.

606
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:11,340
The new Russian Bolshevik government or 
the American government of Woodrow 

607
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:11,650
Wilson.

608
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,720
In a sense though,
it's hard to blame,

609
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:22,070
you know,
Britain and France and these other 

610
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,971
European powers for the fact that they 
had gone into the war making agreements 

611
00:40:24,161 --> 00:40:29,161
with each other and their allies for 
carving up this territory or exchanging 

612
00:40:29,161 --> 00:40:33,991
that territory because that was standard
operating procedure when the war started

613
00:40:34,241 --> 00:40:35,360
and had been,
you know,

614
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:40,380
forever.
The 19th century is full of those kinds 

615
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,811
of conflicts.
The problem is in just a couple of 

616
00:40:42,811 --> 00:40:44,200
years,
things have changed in so many ways.

617
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,560
The first world war is that 
transitionary period from the 19th to 

618
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:53,221
the 20th century and that includes 
things like the proper and moral 

619
00:40:54,311 --> 00:40:59,311
justifications for war.
I'm part of the problem is that for 

620
00:40:59,311 --> 00:41:01,210
three years now,
the allies,

621
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:06,600
to name just one example,
the central powers were doing similar 

622
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,361
things,
had made the war aims out to be these 

623
00:41:09,361 --> 00:41:10,030
high minded ideals,
right?

624
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:15,330
The war to end all wars or making the 
world safe for democracy or fighting,

625
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,620
you know,
German militarism.

626
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,780
I mean there were all these very high 
minded ideals.

627
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:24,990
So when you sell people on those ideas,
when they find out that really what 

628
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:28,150
those soldiers are dying for is much 
more pedestrian,

629
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:29,650
you know,
sorts of ames,

630
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:35,450
it's hard to square those two realities.
In fact,

631
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:40,660
there were nations involved in the first
world war that essentially had joined 

632
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,330
sides with,
you know,

633
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:44,120
the,
the alliance that promised them the best

634
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:45,620
outcome.
Italy,

635
00:41:45,621 --> 00:41:47,030
Bulgaria,
Romania,

636
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:50,870
to name just three countries got into 
this war for no other reason than,

637
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,460
you know,
one side or the other,

638
00:41:52,461 --> 00:41:57,461
promise them some territorial gain that 
was more than the other side promised 

639
00:41:57,461 --> 00:42:01,651
them.
That was a very common reality from the 

640
00:42:01,651 --> 00:42:04,331
19th century.
Part of what changed that and made it 

641
00:42:04,331 --> 00:42:09,130
unacceptable was the price that Europe 
was being forced to pay for these 

642
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,270
territorial acquisitions.
I mean,

643
00:42:11,271 --> 00:42:16,271
a perfect example is 20 years before 
this time period where we are now 

644
00:42:16,271 --> 00:42:16,271
instead of 19,
17,

645
00:42:16,271 --> 00:42:17,150
eight,
late 1917.

646
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:22,150
Imagine you're in 18,
98 and you're the British army in an 

647
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,990
area that's going to become part of,
you know,

648
00:42:23,991 --> 00:42:28,991
your colonial,
the territories that you have direct or 

649
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,810
indirect control over in the modern 
nation of Sudan.

650
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:34,010
There was a very big battle called 
Omdurman fought in 18,

651
00:42:34,011 --> 00:42:39,011
98.
Winston Churchill was there as a very 

652
00:42:39,011 --> 00:42:39,011
young man.
His first real exposure to violence,

653
00:42:39,011 --> 00:42:40,460
I think he killed a couple of people in 
that battle,

654
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:45,080
honor Omdurman had about 8,000
or so British troops and then they had a

655
00:42:45,081 --> 00:42:47,810
bunch of allies of theirs from Egypt and
places like that.

656
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,580
Natives is not the right word because 
you think of like tribesmen but,

657
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,760
but but troops from Egypt and they were 
fighting people who were kind of 

658
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,090
tribesmen a bunch of Sudanese under.
I'm a leader in that country,

659
00:43:02,091 --> 00:43:07,091
more than 50,000
of them show up to this battle against 

660
00:43:07,091 --> 00:43:10,331
this small group of,
of British and British allies and using 

661
00:43:11,511 --> 00:43:14,900
modern weaponry,
including basically machine guns,

662
00:43:14,901 --> 00:43:19,901
modern rifles.
I mean it's essentially in a Beta 

663
00:43:19,901 --> 00:43:22,391
version of the first world war army that
Britain goes to war with and they're 

664
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,961
fighting guys who have muskets 
practically and in one afternoon they 

665
00:43:27,461 --> 00:43:32,461
inflict some 30,000
or more casual to use on the tribesmen 

666
00:43:32,461 --> 00:43:34,060
and folks that they're facing.

667
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,500
10,000
dead,

668
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:41,630
5,000
captured the rest wounded and the 

669
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:44,091
British lose 45 to 50 British soldiers 
in the endeavor,

670
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:49,910
45 to 50 and they just demolished this 
native force when you're only losing 

671
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:55,530
that number of people for such great 
gains.

672
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:02,210
Sometimes you don't always think too 
much about the deeper questions involved

673
00:44:02,311 --> 00:44:05,760
in the cost because the cost isn't that 
great and let's be honest,

674
00:44:05,761 --> 00:44:10,761
in this era,
if those British soldiers had been 

675
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:14,211
wiping out Frenchman or Germans or 
Swedes are people like themselves,

676
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:20,090
there might've been more of an outrage.
It was an era where sometimes the 

677
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:25,071
killing of native peoples in other 
places was not given the same sort of a 

678
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:31,090
sense of horror and outrage that killing
people who looked like yourself might

679
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,440
engender.
We all understand how that might work.

680
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,480
And so instead of a battle of Omdurman 
where the changing of territory was it 

681
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,090
relatively small affair with relatively 
few casualties.

682
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:46,920
You know,
in late 1917,

683
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:49,740
the Germans and the British in just one 
battle in this war,

684
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:53,040
you know,
suffer between 200 and 500,000

685
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:57,620
casualties each.
You think of deeper,

686
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:02,890
different,
more fundamental questions when you not 

687
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:06,251
only suffer casualties like that,
but you do so over and over and over 

688
00:45:06,251 --> 00:45:09,410
again with no appreciable change,
nothing,

689
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,920
certainly worth all that and you begin 
asking fundamental questions about these

690
00:45:12,921 --> 00:45:15,920
treaties.
You wrote an earlier time in this war,

691
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,400
how many Frenchman is it worth losing to
regain the lost territories of Alsace 

692
00:45:21,681 --> 00:45:26,180
and Lorraine,
how many German young people is it worth

693
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,720
to hold onto Belgium?
How many Austro-hungarian troops or 

694
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,651
conversely Italian troops you know is 
that particular area near [inaudible] 

695
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:42,860
worth?
How many diminutive lives in Indian 

696
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:48,231
lives in British lives?
Is postwar British involvement in the 

697
00:45:48,231 --> 00:45:50,280
Middle East worth?
Well,

698
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:52,830
if it's the battle of Omdurman and we're
talking tiny numbers,

699
00:45:52,831 --> 00:45:57,831
it's certainly worth it.
There's a number that you're going to 

700
00:45:57,831 --> 00:45:57,840
get to when it's not

701
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:05,170
and the first world war challenges a lot
of people to ask those kinds of 

702
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:08,201
questions and the people that were 
operating under the same sort of 

703
00:46:08,201 --> 00:46:10,730
mentality that would have been present 
at a battle of Omdurman are red faced.

704
00:46:10,731 --> 00:46:15,731
When these treaties show up,
showing that that's just what they're 

705
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:18,281
like.
They haven't changed yet and the 

706
00:46:18,281 --> 00:46:18,281
treaties are going to have to be 
fulfilled anyway.

707
00:46:18,281 --> 00:46:23,200
Meanwhile,
if you didn't feel bad enough in late 

708
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,871
1917 when the bolsheviks released this 
information in January of 1918 in part 

709
00:46:26,391 --> 00:46:28,850
because the bolsheviks did release this 
information,

710
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:34,270
President Woodrow Wilson in the United 
States released something called the 14 

711
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:37,010
points.
Now the 14 points,

712
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:42,300
if it's,
if the Bolshevik move that makes the 

713
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:42,600
rest of the world looked like a bunch of
capitalists,

714
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:47,601
warmongers is like a left hook.
The American move in 1918 in January.

715
00:46:48,561 --> 00:46:52,760
It's like a right cross right afterwards
to all these European old powers because

716
00:46:52,761 --> 00:46:57,761
the United States hitting from,
from the other side of the idealism 

717
00:46:57,761 --> 00:47:01,121
scale are suggesting that you should 
have a war based on things like mutual 

718
00:47:02,781 --> 00:47:03,620
respect.

719
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:09,310
Woodrow Wilson says Nice things,
for example about the Germans and how 

720
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:12,280
the Americans and the rest of the world 
do not begrudge the Germans a shot at 

721
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:12,830
German greatness and all this kind of 
stuff.

722
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,510
In other words,
conciliatory stuff.

723
00:47:14,511 --> 00:47:19,511
If you're trying to have a deal and make
everybody come to the table feeling 

724
00:47:19,511 --> 00:47:19,511
like,
yes,

725
00:47:19,511 --> 00:47:23,201
we can work together,
but if you're the French and you've 

726
00:47:23,201 --> 00:47:23,510
already suffered more than a million 
casualties against these people,

727
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,150
you had a war against them.
Regeneration in the past.

728
00:47:26,151 --> 00:47:30,340
I mean you're not really in the mood to 
be very conciliatory and then Wilson

729
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,400
starts talking about stuff that's as 
idealistic as anything the Bolsheviks 

730
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,820
are putting out and a lot of it sounds 
very similar.

731
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:41,821
For example,
here's how Wilson leads into his 14 

732
00:47:41,821 --> 00:47:45,451
points and notice how often he talks 
about a change in you know,

733
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:50,910
what we could maybe call today global 
public opinion or international morality

734
00:47:52,181 --> 00:47:57,181
and values.
He says from the beginning of his 

735
00:47:57,181 --> 00:47:59,180
statement that's gone down in history as
the 14 points quote,

736
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:05,700
it will be our wish and purpose that the
processes of peace when they are begun 

737
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:10,890
shall be absolutely open and they shall 
involve and permit henceforth no secret 

738
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:15,871
understandings of any kind.
The day of conquest and aggrandizement 

739
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:20,430
is gone by.
So it was also the day of secret 

740
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:21,520
covenance entered into in the interest 
of particular governments.

741
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,780
And likely at some unlooked for a moment
to upset the peace of the world.

742
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:31,100
It is this happy fat now clear to the 
view of every public man whose thoughts 

743
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,520
do not still linger in an age that is 
dead and gone,

744
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,760
which makes it possible for every nation
whose purposes are consistent with 

745
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,840
justice and the peace of the world to 
avow,

746
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,960
nor at any other time the objects it has
in view.

747
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:49,440
And he then goes into you know the kinds
of things he's talking about here that 

748
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,360
will make a difference in the postwar 
world and that everybody should start to

749
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:54,160
agree to.
He says,

750
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:58,450
as the number 1:14,
number one point in the 14 points,

751
00:48:58,451 --> 00:49:03,451
quote,
open covenance of peace openly arrived 

752
00:49:03,451 --> 00:49:07,591
at after,
which there shall be no private 

753
00:49:07,591 --> 00:49:07,591
international understandings of any 
kind,

754
00:49:07,591 --> 00:49:10,720
but diplomacy shall proceed always 
frankly,

755
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:13,120
and in the public view.
And to quote,

756
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:18,070
can you imagine even the governments of 
our world today?

757
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:23,580
Even talking about doing that,
the idea that Jews had treaties with 

758
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:27,000
other countries and all the agreements 
should be public and open to everyone.

759
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,840
I mean,
that's radical stuff.

760
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:33,870
Even today,
it sounded every bit like what the 

761
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,040
Bolsheviks were calling for and all of a
sudden you have all Europe.

762
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,210
The three,
four,

763
00:49:37,211 --> 00:49:39,550
five years ago was sitting at the height
of his fame.

764
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:44,550
Everything was fine and now they've got 
this on both sides of them from powerful

765
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:47,650
nations.
It's a real change in attitude.

766
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:52,890
As I said,
though it's not going to be allowed to 

767
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:55,591
change agreements that countries have 
between each other and the juiciest 

768
00:49:55,601 --> 00:50:00,601
stuff that came out of these secret 
treaty released the the Edward Snowden 

769
00:50:00,601 --> 00:50:04,801
like dumped to the Manchester Guardian 
and others was the treaties that had 

770
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:08,130
been signed.
Some of them as late as 1916,

771
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,390
the most famous is known as the Sikes 
Pico agreement,

772
00:50:10,391 --> 00:50:15,391
but there are others that catalog the 
great powers plan for ripping apart the 

773
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:22,620
Ottoman Empire.
If the great powers on the allied side 

774
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,511
won the war,
they were going to go totally imperial 

775
00:50:24,511 --> 00:50:26,320
on the old empire.
The Russians were going to finally,

776
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:29,780
after hundreds of years of wanting it 
get constantinople,

777
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:34,490
Istanbul later byzantium.
Once upon a time,

778
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,470
this great city,
the controls,

779
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:41,730
you know,
the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus and 

780
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:41,730
the,
you know,

781
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:44,471
the,
the access to the Black Sea would be a 

782
00:50:44,471 --> 00:50:44,471
huge coup.

783
00:50:44,471 --> 00:50:46,940
The Russians were prevented from doing 
this by the very British and French that

784
00:50:46,941 --> 00:50:51,590
they were now negotiating with to get it
in the 18 fifties in the Crimean war,

785
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,530
which propped up the Ottoman Empire for 
another generation,

786
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,410
but now the Russians were on the same 
side as the French and the British.

787
00:50:57,590 --> 00:51:02,590
They had all decided that the Ottomans 
had to go and they were all going to 

788
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:03,110
agree on what pieces they got.
Now,

789
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:08,140
the payoff for the Russians getting 
constantinople on the regions around 

790
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:11,891
that was that the French and the British
would get to carve up much of what is 

791
00:51:11,891 --> 00:51:14,810
now the modern Middle East.
I just don't write me the email.

792
00:51:14,811 --> 00:51:19,811
I know that even saying the term Middle 
East is a reference to their colonial 

793
00:51:19,811 --> 00:51:23,150
past in that region because really if 
you were going to announce it properly,

794
00:51:23,151 --> 00:51:26,180
you should call it West Asia or 
something like that,

795
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:29,030
but that doesn't really denote the exact
area you're talking about.

796
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,300
You could get into the,
the,

797
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:31,460
the,
the areas,

798
00:51:31,461 --> 00:51:34,460
I bet you could say double the lavant or
Anatolia or Mesopotamia,

799
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:38,450
but those are all just pieces of the 
term Middle East encompasses.

800
00:51:38,451 --> 00:51:40,730
So I apologize.
I know it's not the right phrase.

801
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:46,090
Nonetheless.
We all know what we mean and certainly 

802
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:48,221
if we're going to talk about the era 
where Middle East becomes the colonial 

803
00:51:48,221 --> 00:51:51,191
term for the era,
why not start with the era where it 

804
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,820
becomes a colonial possession for non 
Islamic powers,

805
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:58,150
the Sikes,
Pico agreement and others have France 

806
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,401
carving up large chunks of the modern 
Arab world and the British taking 

807
00:52:00,401 --> 00:52:05,321
northern Iraq and I mean the,
the breathtaking they really are.

808
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:12,041
And when the Bolsheviks released the 
secret treaties and the Ottoman 

809
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:14,360
government reads the secret treaties to 
their own,

810
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,550
you know,
group of,

811
00:52:15,551 --> 00:52:17,900
um,
nobles is the wrong word,

812
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:20,990
but governmental ministers,
um,

813
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:26,020
Eugene Rogan says in his book that 
there's this audible gasp as they hear 

814
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:29,210
the plans that France and Britain and 
Russia have,

815
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,160
you know,
for the future of the Ottomans,

816
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,900
it's not going to be a slap on the 
wrist.

817
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,900
It's going to be dismemberment.
And the dismemberment of the Ottoman 

818
00:52:38,211 --> 00:52:43,211
empire is what creates the modern Middle
Eastern world that is still such a part 

819
00:52:43,211 --> 00:52:47,621
of our lives today.
I had said earlier that the Bolshevik 

820
00:52:47,621 --> 00:52:48,410
revolution was probably the top,
you know,

821
00:52:48,411 --> 00:52:51,170
long lasting after shock from the first 
world war.

822
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:55,520
But maybe it's better to say that 
there's a list of three or four possible

823
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,650
claimants to the throne,
if you will.

824
00:52:57,651 --> 00:53:02,651
And maybe another one is the changes 
that are created in the Middle East 

825
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,950
because the Ottoman Empire is broken up.
Let's remember,

826
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:11,951
this is a 600 year old empire.
It's hard to overstate how long the 

827
00:53:13,461 --> 00:53:18,020
structures and the type of rule by the 
Ottoman impacted that area.

828
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:23,290
First of all,
it was a large area that was under 

829
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:25,500
Muslim control with a caliphate on paper
at least.

830
00:53:25,501 --> 00:53:30,501
And the leader of the religion,
at least the Sunni branch of it in 

831
00:53:30,501 --> 00:53:33,510
Turkey,
the Turks ruled that region with an iron

832
00:53:33,511 --> 00:53:34,080
fist.

833
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:39,530
And yet at the same time it was in the 
process of having huge debates over 

834
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:42,060
modernization and keeping up with the 
rest of the world.

835
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:47,390
And they were just a few years from 
finding out that they sat at the top 

836
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,480
some of the world's greatest deposits of
oil on the planet,

837
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:56,930
which some more conspiratorial 
historians will will weave into the 

838
00:53:56,930 --> 00:54:01,101
story and point out that it wasn't an 
accident that the French and the 

839
00:54:01,101 --> 00:54:01,101
British,
for example,

840
00:54:01,101 --> 00:54:04,020
we're deciding that it was worth tearing
up the Ottoman Empire at this point,

841
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:10,310
but if they hadn't and somehow the 
Ottoman empire existed in another 10 or 

842
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:13,470
20 years,
think about the inheritance it was about

843
00:54:13,471 --> 00:54:18,471
to come into as a giant multiethnic 
Islamic state with oil wealth coming 

844
00:54:23,611 --> 00:54:24,480
into the.
I mean it just.

845
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:27,450
It's fascinating to ponder how different
the world might be,

846
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:30,330
but if you're a member of the government
of autumn,

847
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:35,390
Turkey,
when you hear the news about how you're 

848
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:36,870
going to be dismembered as part of these
secret agreements that become public,

849
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,350
you're getting that information about a 
week,

850
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:45,380
maybe even a little less than a week on 
the heels of some other information.

851
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:50,810
That's sort of.
Should have warned you that this was 

852
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:52,461
coming because everybody awoke to a 
declaration that was published on 

853
00:54:52,461 --> 00:54:53,940
November second,
1917.

854
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:57,090
That appeared in a bunch of newspapers 
and kind of went viral,

855
00:54:57,091 --> 00:55:02,091
I guess you could say by the standards 
of the early 20th century and the 

856
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:05,190
statements said this quote,
His Majesty's government view with favor

857
00:55:05,191 --> 00:55:10,191
the establishment in Palestine of a 
national home for the Jewish people and 

858
00:55:10,411 --> 00:55:15,411
will use their best endeavors to 
facilitate the achievement of this 

859
00:55:15,411 --> 00:55:17,160
object.
It being clearly understood that nothing

860
00:55:17,161 --> 00:55:22,161
shall be done,
which may prejudice the civil and 

861
00:55:22,161 --> 00:55:24,591
religious rights of existing non Jewish 
communities in Palestine or the rights 

862
00:55:24,591 --> 00:55:28,821
and political status enjoyed by Jews in 
any other countries and to quote so you 

863
00:55:29,491 --> 00:55:34,491
get that on November second,
you get the news on the eighth or the 

864
00:55:34,491 --> 00:55:34,491
ninth.
You know about the sites,

865
00:55:34,491 --> 00:55:39,441
Pico agreement in the others that don't 
just tear up your empire and give it to 

866
00:55:39,441 --> 00:55:41,700
the victorious powers if they're going 
to be victorious,

867
00:55:41,701 --> 00:55:46,701
that's still up in the air,
but also gives it to peoples who are 

868
00:55:46,701 --> 00:55:48,150
currently in your empire.

869
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:53,150
Now,
most notably Arab people in a very 

870
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:57,900
similar move to what the Germans had 
done when they sent Vladimir Lenin to go

871
00:55:57,901 --> 00:56:00,780
into Russia and destabilize that 
country.

872
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,960
The British had been working with 
subjects of the Ottoman empire and 

873
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,221
encouraging them to rebel.
There were a couple of important Arab 

874
00:56:10,221 --> 00:56:14,121
tribal leaders that were already sort of
thinking along those lines and may have 

875
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:16,080
had contact with the British even before
war broke out,

876
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,940
who by 1915,
19,

877
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:21,780
16 were convinced to rebel against the 
Ottoman overlords.

878
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:27,080
They had a lot of British help.
They eventually went from a bunch of 

879
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,640
ragtag gorillas to a a relatively nasty 
guerrilla force in the region.

880
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:35,641
Although the impact that they had on the
war has been argued about forever with 

881
00:56:35,641 --> 00:56:36,550
historians.
It's a very colorful story.

882
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:39,520
It involves this person that's called 
Lawrence of Arabia.

883
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:42,130
They made a movie about him,
but there's a lot more to that,

884
00:56:42,131 --> 00:56:47,131
including the most important people,
which were these two tribal families 

885
00:56:47,131 --> 00:56:50,110
that the British were able to convince 
to rebel against the Ottomans,

886
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,730
both of whom were important.

887
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:56,730
One controlled the area around Mecca.
The other had a name now graces the 

888
00:56:58,091 --> 00:57:02,230
front of the country that occupies the 
Arabian peninsula.

889
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:07,231
Saudi and the other family put kings on 
the thrones of multiple post World War 

890
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:11,170
One,
Middle Eastern nations.

891
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:16,120
The kings of Iraq came from this family,
the kings of places like Jordan,

892
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,180
the current king of Jordan is a 
descendant of this family.

893
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:23,560
And that power emanated from this first 
world war,

894
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:28,590
throwing their lot in with the allies 
and then,

895
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,120
you know,
reaping the reward.

896
00:57:31,121 --> 00:57:34,240
Now,
it should be pointed out that the reward

897
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:39,480
was not what they'd planned and the 
British after the war found themselves 

898
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,441
in a rather uncomfortable position when 
they realized that they had promised 

899
00:57:43,441 --> 00:57:47,551
multiple things to multiple people.
And oftentimes it was the same stuff.

900
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:52,270
This will lead to some embarrassing 
moments after the war,

901
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:55,450
uh,
over questions about fine print and what

902
00:57:55,451 --> 00:58:00,430
was really sad and meant a Sir Henry 
Wilson who was the chief of the imperial

903
00:58:00,431 --> 00:58:05,431
general staff in 19,
19 will tell another British general 

904
00:58:05,431 --> 00:58:05,431
quote.

905
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:10,440
We have made so many promises to 
everybody in a contradictory sense that 

906
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:15,061
I cannot for the life of me see how we 
can get out of our president mess 

907
00:58:15,061 --> 00:58:16,450
without breaking our word to somebody 
and quote.

908
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:22,110
And it's easy to see why the Arabs had 
been promised things and what it was 

909
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:25,000
hoped that they would do the rebellion.
What's been more argued about in is more

910
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:28,630
interesting for historians,
is trying to figure out what was,

911
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:31,810
what was to be achieved by the Balfour 
Declaration.

912
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:35,440
And there are so many different 
rationales that have been put forward.

913
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:38,620
That could be a study,
an interesting show in and of itself.

914
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:44,100
I mean,
it runs the gamut too from people who 

915
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:44,230
are suggesting that the reason the 
British throw their weight behind,

916
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:46,870
you know,
a Jewish homeland in Palestine has to do

917
00:58:46,871 --> 00:58:49,600
with a personal relationship with the 
Jewish guy who helped,

918
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:52,210
you know,
make it easier to create a weapon.

919
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,960
There's another theory that it was hoped
that they could have a,

920
00:58:55,961 --> 00:59:00,961
the British,
one of the friendly people to occupy 

921
00:59:00,961 --> 00:59:03,481
this important area to sort of help 
guard Britain's imperial possessions in 

922
00:59:03,481 --> 00:59:05,920
places like India.
But my favorite of the many,

923
00:59:05,921 --> 00:59:09,460
many theories out there for why the 
Balfour Declaration,

924
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:13,960
this important benchmark moment in the 
history of modern Zionism happened.

925
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:19,290
My favorite is the antisemetic reason 
that it might've happened that some 

926
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:23,221
people put forward,
which is that there were both a 

927
00:59:23,221 --> 00:59:25,720
combination of real antisemites out 
there and people who were pretty 

928
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:30,311
educated in pretty sure that it was just
a canard when people said the Jews ruled

929
00:59:30,951 --> 00:59:34,040
the world,
but just in case it wasn't,

930
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:39,190
wouldn't it be worth it just to be on 
the safe side if we made sure that 

931
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:41,660
Jewish public interest the world over 
was on our side.

932
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:46,720
In fact,
the British were even worried about 

933
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,781
rumors that the Germans were going to 
offer the Jews a homeland if Jews sort 

934
00:59:49,931 --> 00:59:54,931
of signed on with the German cars and so
in an effort to make sure that if the 

935
00:59:54,931 --> 00:59:56,240
Jews controlled the world,
they were on our side,

936
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:59,720
that we were going to have a statement 
made that said,

937
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:03,560
we supported a return to Palestine for 
Jewish folks.

938
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,590
I love that.
Without that,

939
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,980
just that's the most perverse of all the
excuses,

940
01:00:06,981 --> 01:00:11,981
but nonetheless,
what it did was plant a seed that later 

941
01:00:12,951 --> 01:00:15,860
on we all understand will grow into,
you know,

942
01:00:15,861 --> 01:00:17,930
the modern Middle East that we have 
today.

943
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:24,470
There's also that one other little 
element that of course plays a role in 

944
01:00:24,961 --> 01:00:29,961
this story.
We mentioned it a little bit ago that 

945
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:33,651
turns this region from what you easily 
could have suggested might be a 

946
01:00:34,651 --> 01:00:39,651
backwater in the middle of nowhere after
the war was over with some important 

947
01:00:39,651 --> 01:00:44,301
religious sacred sites and whatnot,
but not much going on in the way of 

948
01:00:44,301 --> 01:00:47,831
resources or value or anything where the
great powers on the world stage would 

949
01:00:47,831 --> 01:00:51,891
care much for this area and instead 
transforms this region into perhaps the 

950
01:00:53,551 --> 01:00:57,540
most strategically valuable spot on the 
planet.

951
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:04,150
It's because all of a sudden the world 
realizes the importance that oil and 

952
01:01:05,451 --> 01:01:10,451
petroleum is going to play in the 20th 
century world and everybody's sort of 

953
01:01:10,451 --> 01:01:14,951
realize it at the same time.
It's one of my favorite parts of the 

954
01:01:14,951 --> 01:01:19,301
first world war story too,
and it's so hard to figure out what 

955
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:22,451
people knew when there had been 
visionaries all throughout the 

956
01:01:22,451 --> 01:01:27,251
development of the 20th century.
Realization that oil was going to be 

957
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:27,890
huge.
I mean,

958
01:01:27,891 --> 01:01:31,160
they start pumping this stuff and the 
1840 [inaudible],

959
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:36,170
50 [inaudible],
18 sixties and a bunch of different 

960
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:38,081
places and refining it,
and the main reason it's important in 

961
01:01:38,081 --> 01:01:42,041
the 18 hundreds.
Remember the 18 hundreds is part of the 

962
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:45,041
industrial revolution.
The industrial revolution was a 

963
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:48,071
revolution that functioned mostly with 
coal as the energy source.

964
01:01:48,081 --> 01:01:53,081
Although steam was also used,
the people that are making the decisions

965
01:01:53,481 --> 01:01:58,340
in the first world war are going to be 
men in age groups who grew up in a world

966
01:01:58,341 --> 01:02:00,380
powered by coal and steam

967
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:06,440
oil was becoming quite valuable,
but for different reasons than energy.

968
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:12,280
Well,
I guess you could still say it was 

969
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:13,790
energy was.
It was an illumination source and a lot 

970
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:16,211
of places they used it for light.
They also used it for lubrication and 

971
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:21,240
oil,
but people did foresee what maybe you 

972
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:26,031
could call the vehicular revolution that
the first world war would so plainly 

973
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,360
sort of put on steroids.
It was coming anyway,

974
01:02:30,361 --> 01:02:35,361
but you know how war tends to speed up 
technological progress because while 

975
01:02:35,361 --> 01:02:39,741
it's life or death,
one of the famous stories of the first 

976
01:02:39,741 --> 01:02:43,281
World War is the famous battle of the 
Marne story of the taxi cabs of Paris 

977
01:02:43,281 --> 01:02:48,050
lining up to ferry troops to the very 
hot spot on the battle front that was in

978
01:02:48,451 --> 01:02:53,451
near danger of breaking.
This is all the romantic story that 

979
01:02:53,451 --> 01:02:55,020
helps illustrate one of the really early
trends in the first world war,

980
01:02:55,021 --> 01:03:00,021
the use of vehicles in to change the 
situation on the battlefield for all of 

981
01:03:01,051 --> 01:03:01,950
human history.

982
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:05,190
Men have either been walking themselves 
or utilizing,

983
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:08,610
you know,
natural animal power in this battle.

984
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:13,700
They were starting to use things that 
were powered by gasoline and you would 

985
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:17,430
go from cars and taxi cabs,
two trucks,

986
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:21,750
two tanks.
You'd have aircraft try to imagine,

987
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:25,140
and I'm sure Leonardo Davinci could do a
great sketch of it in the renaissance,

988
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:30,320
but try to imagine aircraft that were 
coal or steam powered.

989
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:36,620
You kind of needed this dense,
portable energy source that became part 

990
01:03:37,081 --> 01:03:42,081
of internal combustion engines and all 
this stuff sort of happened during the 

991
01:03:42,271 --> 01:03:47,271
war.
The visionaries had been people like 

992
01:03:47,271 --> 01:03:51,171
Churchill who had said convert the 
British fleet to oil burning instead of 

993
01:03:51,171 --> 01:03:54,690
coal.
He was ahead of his time in like 19.

994
01:03:54,691 --> 01:03:59,691
Oh eight.
The British government was making deals 

995
01:03:59,691 --> 01:04:01,611
with an oil company in Iran.
It's called the Anglo Persian oil 

996
01:04:01,611 --> 01:04:05,451
company.
It was very powerful and very important 

997
01:04:05,451 --> 01:04:07,281
for a long time,
but once again shows that some people 

998
01:04:07,281 --> 01:04:08,520
were on top of this or as some 
historians have suggested,

999
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:12,060
they may have just been doing this for 
the lubrication and illumination value.

1000
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:14,880
They may not have foreseen the vehicular
revolution either,

1001
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:17,070
but once it strikes,
you know,

1002
01:04:17,071 --> 01:04:19,710
even people who aren't all that 
visionary can see,

1003
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:21,500
oh my gosh,
you know,

1004
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:26,510
oil is the coal of the 20th century.
And I often think to myself,

1005
01:04:26,911 --> 01:04:31,911
you know,
if you found the oil of the 21st 

1006
01:04:31,911 --> 01:04:35,631
century,
some clean burning immensely wonderful 

1007
01:04:35,631 --> 01:04:37,500
replacement to oil that could do all 
these fantastic things,

1008
01:04:37,501 --> 01:04:42,090
but it only appeared in a few separate 
isolated regions.

1009
01:04:42,091 --> 01:04:45,450
Around the globe,
what do you think the governments of the

1010
01:04:45,451 --> 01:04:50,451
world would do today about that?
I mean here I've been critical of the 

1011
01:04:51,301 --> 01:04:56,301
great powers for some of the horse 
trading that was apparent in all their 

1012
01:04:56,461 --> 01:05:01,461
war aims and have probably 
overemphasized that to a degree 

1013
01:05:01,461 --> 01:05:03,660
considering how much geopolitics did 
play a role in economics,

1014
01:05:03,661 --> 01:05:06,480
did play a role.
The first world war had a lot of reasons

1015
01:05:06,481 --> 01:05:11,481
and the reasons that countries got into 
it had a lot of different causes and 

1016
01:05:11,481 --> 01:05:14,481
nuances as well,
but it's the horse trading nature of 

1017
01:05:14,481 --> 01:05:17,040
territories that seems to stand out so 
much to modern.

1018
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:24,700
It does make me think however,
that if that 21st century version of oil

1019
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:29,970
were found tomorrow,
but in limited amounts and in limited 

1020
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:30,610
areas,
you know,

1021
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:35,670
I do wonder whether our governments 
would act any differently in terms of 

1022
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:38,050
the way they would approach it.
Then that first world war leadership,

1023
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:44,400
if anything,
I would imagine that what they learned 

1024
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,790
from the first world war is not what to 
do or what not to do,

1025
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:51,360
but perhaps have a better sense of how 
you justify what you do in the first 

1026
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:56,881
World War Two,
our modern sensibilities and to the 

1027
01:05:56,881 --> 01:05:59,581
changing sensibilities of the time.
It all seemed a little too naked 

1028
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:03,481
sometimes once it was exposed to the 
light of day and yet it's hard to blame 

1029
01:06:03,641 --> 01:06:08,641
any of these powers for doing whatever 
it took to see to it that you could get 

1030
01:06:09,971 --> 01:06:14,971
yourself some of this new 20th century 
version of coal because it could 

1031
01:06:16,031 --> 01:06:21,031
literally be a matter of life or death 
in terms of remaining a great power and 

1032
01:06:22,931 --> 01:06:26,470
as normally happens in the lottery for 
natural resources.

1033
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:31,740
Some places we're blessed with lots of 
this stuff and other places with almost 

1034
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:36,181
none.
The United States is one of the first 

1035
01:06:36,181 --> 01:06:39,481
places where the first grade,
I mean it's the Saudi Arabia of the 

1036
01:06:39,481 --> 01:06:41,050
first grade oil boom.
I mean the United States.

1037
01:06:41,051 --> 01:06:44,950
They find it in Pennsylvania initially 
and then in a ton of other places.

1038
01:06:44,951 --> 01:06:49,951
The United States is one of the great 
oil producing nations of all time and 

1039
01:06:49,951 --> 01:06:52,810
they really come into their own right 
when the oil really takes off.

1040
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,280
Very,
very late 18,

1041
01:06:54,281 --> 01:06:55,600
hundreds,
early 19 hundreds.

1042
01:06:56,230 --> 01:07:01,230
Russia also has some wonderful reserves 
that have been under development from 

1043
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:05,791
very early on in Baku in places in 
what's now a parts of Azerbaijan and the

1044
01:07:06,251 --> 01:07:09,070
problem they were having of course,
as this Bolshevik revolution,

1045
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:12,550
a lot of these out of the way places on 
the Russian periphery.

1046
01:07:12,551 --> 01:07:17,551
We're deciding maybe to go on their own 
and take the oil with them,

1047
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:21,020
so temporary problems for the Russians 
in who,

1048
01:07:21,021 --> 01:07:26,021
but what that does is create a situation
where there's a giant wonderful supply 

1049
01:07:27,431 --> 01:07:32,431
of oil sitting there with no big 
government controlling it temporarily 

1050
01:07:32,431 --> 01:07:37,261
because the bolsheviks yeah,
their whole thing is in disorder and 

1051
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:38,020
they're trying to get a handle on things
and they're preaching self determination

1052
01:07:38,021 --> 01:07:39,490
and people are taking them up on the 
offer.

1053
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:44,490
And Bach,
who was all of a sudden you're going to 

1054
01:07:44,490 --> 01:07:44,490
break away and become part of some maybe
Azerbaijani state.

1055
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:49,740
That is just too much of a temptation 
for a bunch of great powers that look at

1056
01:07:50,381 --> 01:07:55,381
it and think,
I bet I could get there with an army if 

1057
01:07:55,381 --> 01:07:57,520
I tried hard enough and what if we could
seize the oil fields of buck?

1058
01:07:57,521 --> 01:08:02,521
Who the only other good source anywhere 
around Europe was in Romania and about 

1059
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:09,181
1917.
All the great powers realize we got to 

1060
01:08:09,181 --> 01:08:11,110
get ourselves some oil and the British 
and the French and the Germans.

1061
01:08:11,111 --> 01:08:13,270
Three of the great powers on the world 
stage.

1062
01:08:13,271 --> 01:08:18,271
When the first world war started,
none of them have good access to large 

1063
01:08:18,271 --> 01:08:22,060
amounts of oil.
It's hard to suggest that there is any 

1064
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:28,180
bigger national security concern for 
those nations at this point than to 

1065
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:32,531
secure themselves a supply of this 
century's great energy source and the 

1066
01:08:33,891 --> 01:08:38,891
one that's needed to power the most 
cutting edge weapons that you need to 

1067
01:08:38,891 --> 01:08:42,020
win any war.
It's easy to be critical

1068
01:08:43,170 --> 01:08:45,600
of these people pursuing these kinds of 
policies,

1069
01:08:45,601 --> 01:08:50,601
but look at what the stakes are and from
a purely real politique down and dirty 

1070
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:58,670
standard,
the arguments for imperialism in this 

1071
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:01,560
case make a certain kind of sense.
I mean what they're saying,

1072
01:09:01,561 --> 01:09:04,640
for example,
amongst British politicians,

1073
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:08,550
some of whom do not want to go in and 
control these areas.

1074
01:09:08,551 --> 01:09:12,180
The prime minister before the current 
prime minister in 1917,

1075
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:13,590
Herbert Asquith,
you know,

1076
01:09:13,591 --> 01:09:18,591
he didn't want anything to do with this 
region and all of its problems and 

1077
01:09:18,591 --> 01:09:21,771
factionalism.
I'm in the Arab tribes that were 

1078
01:09:21,771 --> 01:09:24,261
fighting,
fighting on Britain's side as part of 

1079
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:24,300
the Arab revolt.
We're only part of the Arabs out there.

1080
01:09:24,301 --> 01:09:29,301
There were a lot of other areas that 
were very loyal to the Ottoman 

1081
01:09:29,301 --> 01:09:32,241
government.
You had a Sunni and Shiite issues to 

1082
01:09:32,241 --> 01:09:32,520
deal with.
I mean to to ask what it looked like,

1083
01:09:32,521 --> 01:09:37,521
a hornet's nest,
but he had a hard time fighting against 

1084
01:09:37,521 --> 01:09:41,301
the people on the other side of the 
argument who were making the point that 

1085
01:09:41,301 --> 01:09:44,901
you were then going to simply see 
whatever could be taken from the 

1086
01:09:44,901 --> 01:09:49,851
Ottomans.
Once they were gone to your great power 

1087
01:09:49,851 --> 01:09:51,990
rivals mean the French will go in then 
and take the oil perhaps,

1088
01:09:51,991 --> 01:09:56,991
and then they're strengthened while you 
are weakened and you don't have any 

1089
01:09:56,991 --> 01:10:01,251
access to.
The Cole of the 20th century has asked 

1090
01:10:01,251 --> 01:10:02,310
with eventually said,
you know,

1091
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:03,320
he said,
quote,

1092
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:08,390
if we were to leave the other nations to
scramble for Turkey without taking 

1093
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:10,680
anything ourselves,
we should not be doing our duty.

1094
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:11,880
End Quote,

1095
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,290
well,
if not,

1096
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:20,291
having access to your own oil meant that
your country would fall to a second 

1097
01:10:20,961 --> 01:10:25,961
class status.
I think there would have been a lot of 

1098
01:10:25,961 --> 01:10:28,930
people in Britain,
a democratic government who would have 

1099
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:32,960
said that it was their politicians duty 
to see that that didn't happen.

1100
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:39,170
Now the last time we checked in with the
story in the Middle East and all that 

1101
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:43,551
area concerning the Ottomans fighting 
against the British and the French and 

1102
01:10:43,551 --> 01:10:47,031
the British Dominion troops from places 
like India and South Africa and 

1103
01:10:47,031 --> 01:10:48,000
Australia and New Zealand and places 
like that,

1104
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:51,210
that the war hadn't been going 
particularly well.

1105
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:56,630
The Turks were tough.
They put up a pretty darn good 

1106
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:58,050
resistance for a country that was 
supposed to be basically done,

1107
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:01,050
having just fought a couple of wars 
previously,

1108
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:03,510
economics.
We're in a disaster and everything,

1109
01:11:03,690 --> 01:11:06,990
and instead the Turks put up a pretty 
darn spirited resistance.

1110
01:11:06,991 --> 01:11:08,910
They've got the Germans in there helping
them to,

1111
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:14,210
you know,
modernize a little here and there and 

1112
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:16,521
the British simply were not and who 
could be for the logistical challenges 

1113
01:11:16,891 --> 01:11:21,891
that trying to maintain large armies,
which the British didn't tend to 

1114
01:11:21,891 --> 01:11:23,310
maintain in the field anyway,
throughout their history,

1115
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:26,760
in the middle of the desert,
the challenges were huge.

1116
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:31,760
The Turks were tough.
The British essentially had to retreat 

1117
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,601
from politically.
They got trapped in a place called 

1118
01:11:35,601 --> 01:11:38,230
[inaudible],
like we told you in an earlier episode 

1119
01:11:38,230 --> 01:11:38,880
and had to surrender.
It was not exactly their finest hour,

1120
01:11:38,881 --> 01:11:43,881
but in their defense,
most of their effort is in the meat 

1121
01:11:43,881 --> 01:11:43,890
grinder area.
On the western front.

1122
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:49,230
This is an area that some people 
referred to as a side show,

1123
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:55,610
and this gets back to the argument we've
mentioned earlier between those in the 

1124
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:59,361
allied camp that called themselves or 
were called Westerners and the others 

1125
01:11:59,361 --> 01:12:03,030
who were called easterners,
people whose ideas said that the western

1126
01:12:03,031 --> 01:12:08,031
front,
the meat grinder is the focal point of 

1127
01:12:08,031 --> 01:12:08,031
the war.
It's going to be decided there,

1128
01:12:08,031 --> 01:12:12,890
so taking troops and sending them to any
other part of the war is to work against

1129
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:15,780
what you need to be doing,
which is breaking through it.

1130
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:18,270
The key point,
the other group,

1131
01:12:18,271 --> 01:12:23,271
the easterners believed that throwing 
troops into the meat grinder where 

1132
01:12:23,271 --> 01:12:27,381
things were stalemated was a callus 
waste of lives when there were 

1133
01:12:27,381 --> 01:12:30,540
vulnerable points all on the rest of the
map.

1134
01:12:30,541 --> 01:12:33,600
That could be exploited,
easier places to go.

1135
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:38,810
Winston Churchill in the Second World 
War was always looking for the soft 

1136
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:40,680
underbelly of Europe was the way the 
phrased was turned.

1137
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:45,920
In the first World War,
there were easterners looking for the 

1138
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:48,321
soft underbelly of Europe and the best 
argument I've ever heard for who was 

1139
01:12:49,021 --> 01:12:51,390
right because I was looking at Lloyd 
George,

1140
01:12:51,391 --> 01:12:54,660
his memoirs the other day and you know,
20 years after the war,

1141
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:59,661
he still justifying and wagging a finger
in the face of the westerners saying we 

1142
01:12:59,661 --> 01:13:01,350
were right and the westerners are saying
that they were right.

1143
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:05,640
The German General Ludina [inaudible] 
had pointed out that yes,

1144
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:10,820
the West and the western front meat 
grinder was where the war would be 

1145
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:13,020
decided,
but if there was a catastrophe on any of

1146
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:17,460
the other fronts in the war that that 
would impact German power on the western

1147
01:13:17,461 --> 01:13:20,940
front leading to a loss there so that 
they were interconnected.

1148
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:25,350
All these non western front battles are 
sideshows.

1149
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,280
Unless those fronts collapsed and then 
it's a disaster.

1150
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:35,270
In 1917.
The British who have changed generals 

1151
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:39,260
and who have now put a meticulous effort
into just slowly but surely building up 

1152
01:13:40,651 --> 01:13:43,800
the infrastructure that you need to 
maintain an army in the field.

1153
01:13:43,801 --> 01:13:48,801
They're mean.
Just think of the pipelines of water 

1154
01:13:48,801 --> 01:13:52,260
that they build for miles upon miles 
upon miles to go out to where the troops

1155
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:57,261
are going to have to be in trench lines.
I mean the amount of effort that's 

1156
01:13:57,261 --> 01:14:00,351
required,
the buildup of troops and everything 

1157
01:14:00,351 --> 01:14:01,950
else,
but by 1917 they begin to push the Turks

1158
01:14:01,951 --> 01:14:04,530
back everywhere.
You're 19,

1159
01:14:04,531 --> 01:14:09,531
17,
and especially the latter half of the 

1160
01:14:09,531 --> 01:14:11,541
year,
sees multiple victories on the part of 

1161
01:14:11,541 --> 01:14:12,700
the British led allied forces in places 
like Mesopotamia

1162
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:13,600
and Palestine,

1163
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:20,130
lots of outflanking,
some wonderfully clever spy maneuvers 

1164
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:24,871
and some fantastic bravery and audacity 
on the part of some of these dominion 

1165
01:14:25,301 --> 01:14:27,400
mounted infantry forces.
For example,

1166
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:33,060
end up creating a situation where the 
British high command can see Jerusalem,

1167
01:14:33,491 --> 01:14:38,491
the holy city of holy cities,
right sacred to at least three major 

1168
01:14:38,491 --> 01:14:38,560
religions,
Islam,

1169
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:43,800
Christianity and Judaism.
They can see Jerusalem within range and 

1170
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:44,260
they know that they're going to take it 
if this,

1171
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,940
you know,
momentum continues,

1172
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:51,510
but after dealing with passion Dale and 
the mud and the blood and the shock and 

1173
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:54,550
the sense of never ending war,
which just wraps up in mid November.

1174
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:59,350
Lloyd George asks,
British General Allenby if he can manage

1175
01:14:59,351 --> 01:15:04,351
to capture the holy city by Christmas,
says it will be a great Christmas 

1176
01:15:04,351 --> 01:15:06,800
present for the British people.
A little pick me up if you will.

1177
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:12,160
After all of the horribleness,
Lloyd George gets his wish granted on 

1178
01:15:12,951 --> 01:15:17,780
December 11th with the British and 
allied forces already in the city,

1179
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:23,260
they receive a surrender notice from the
Turkish representative who writes,

1180
01:15:23,451 --> 01:15:28,451
quote,
due to the severity of the siege of the 

1181
01:15:28,451 --> 01:15:31,851
city and the suffering that this 
peaceful country has endured from your 

1182
01:15:31,851 --> 01:15:35,220
heavy guns and for fear that these 
deadly bombs will hit the holy places.

1183
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:39,290
We are forced to hand over to you,
the city through Hussein Al Husseini,

1184
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:44,300
the mayor of Jerusalem,
hoping that you will protect Jerusalem 

1185
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:46,320
the way we have protected it for more 
than 500 years

1186
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:52,420
and quote doesn't that note sort of 
bring it all home in terms of the 

1187
01:15:54,521 --> 01:15:59,521
immense age of some of these nation 
states that we're dealing with here.

1188
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:05,310
There's a ton of irony and symbolism.
When the allied forces captured 

1189
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:09,871
Jerusalem,
start with the fact that Christians had 

1190
01:16:09,871 --> 01:16:13,561
captured Jerusalem before in 10,
99 during the first crusade was a very 

1191
01:16:14,451 --> 01:16:17,300
big deal at the time,
followed by a terrible massacre,

1192
01:16:17,301 --> 01:16:20,780
but the Christians managed to hold the 
city for a couple hundred years.

1193
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:26,800
The Islamic general salary in the great 
occurred by the way we'll retake the 

1194
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,850
city during the third crusade and the 
late 12 hundreds.

1195
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:34,270
There will be a major crusade in the 
Middle Ages launched against these very 

1196
01:16:34,521 --> 01:16:39,521
Ottomans.
You know when there are a lot younger 

1197
01:16:39,521 --> 01:16:42,851
and more vigorous of an empire,
and now Christian forces were once again

1198
01:16:44,291 --> 01:16:48,800
moving into this city,
the propaganda

1199
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:52,040
possibilities of an event like this are 
huge,

1200
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:56,000
but it also has some real world postwar 
implications.

1201
01:16:56,001 --> 01:16:59,930
You know that old line that possession 
is nine tenths of the law?

1202
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:05,560
Well,
that will certainly be the case after 

1203
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:07,451
the war when the British are involved in
not always wonderfully nice negotiations

1204
01:17:07,491 --> 01:17:11,330
with the French and people are locals in
that region over who gets what.

1205
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:17,770
There had been some agreements during 
the war that Palestine and Jerusalem 

1206
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:21,491
should be internationalized.
The British didn't like that idea as 

1207
01:17:21,491 --> 01:17:25,181
much after the war and since they were 
the ones governing there since December 

1208
01:17:25,181 --> 01:17:25,820
19,
17,

1209
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:29,510
gave them a unique ability to decide how
things were going to go,

1210
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:34,511
so important in a real world sense to 
the entire affair and its importance of 

1211
01:17:35,811 --> 01:17:40,811
the entry into this holiest of cities 
was understood and stage manage to a 

1212
01:17:40,811 --> 01:17:44,480
degree.
The British government had some ideas on

1213
01:17:44,481 --> 01:17:49,481
the way we would say today,
the optics or the visual should go in 

1214
01:17:49,481 --> 01:17:50,000
18,
98,

1215
01:17:50,001 --> 01:17:55,001
the German emperor,
the Kaiser had visited Jerusalem again 

1216
01:17:55,001 --> 01:17:58,571
with lots of visuals and optics and lots
of photographs and lots of propaganda 

1217
01:17:58,571 --> 01:18:02,600
benefits for doing so,
and he kind of offended some of the 

1218
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:07,301
religious folks by not really seeming 
humble enough in the face of such 

1219
01:18:07,301 --> 01:18:10,430
intense sacredness for three of the top 
religions on the planet.

1220
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:15,970
There was even a story that the Turks 
had to destroy a part of the ancient 

1221
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:16,130
old,
you know,

1222
01:18:16,131 --> 01:18:20,330
Israeli part of the walls to make room 
for the Kaiser's car.

1223
01:18:20,331 --> 01:18:22,070
So He.
So he could bring the car in.

1224
01:18:22,071 --> 01:18:27,071
Whether or not that's true,
it certainly made him look bad and 

1225
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:30,431
before Alan b becomes the first 
Christian conqueror in more than 500 

1226
01:18:30,561 --> 01:18:35,561
years to walk into Jerusalem,
he gets a little advice from British 

1227
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:41,020
General Robertson who tells him in a 
telegram quote in the event of Jerusalem

1228
01:18:41,121 --> 01:18:46,121
being occupied.
It would be of considerable political 

1229
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:49,241
importance if you on officially entering
the city dismount at the city gate and 

1230
01:18:49,851 --> 01:18:54,851
enter on foot German emperor Rodin,
and the same went round a better man 

1231
01:18:55,401 --> 01:18:59,210
than he walked.
Advantage of contrast in conduct will be

1232
01:18:59,211 --> 01:19:04,211
obvious and quote by December 19,
17.

1233
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:11,170
It looks as though it won't take a whole
lot for the British and the French and 

1234
01:19:11,170 --> 01:19:15,071
the dominion forces to strike at the 
Turks and just sort of pushed the entire

1235
01:19:15,261 --> 01:19:16,460
house of cards over.

1236
01:19:17,150 --> 01:19:22,150
And in some ways the Turks are not doing
themselves any good because when the 

1237
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:25,040
Russians pulled out of the war,
it leaves a ton of territories that have

1238
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:27,110
lots of Turks in it.
You know,

1239
01:19:27,111 --> 01:19:32,111
open for Turkish conquest.
And the Turks are sending armies that 

1240
01:19:32,111 --> 01:19:35,531
might be better used against the British
and the French into this territory were 

1241
01:19:35,531 --> 01:19:39,350
places like Armenia and Azerbaijan and 
all those places are in order to get new

1242
01:19:39,351 --> 01:19:42,050
territory while they're losing old 
territory.

1243
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:47,800
Nonetheless,
whether or not the French and the 

1244
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:49,601
British can just push over the house of 
cards now becomes a bit of a moot point 

1245
01:19:49,601 --> 01:19:53,600
because very early into 1918 when the 
finishing touches on any idea to do that

1246
01:19:53,601 --> 01:19:58,601
would have to be in play.
All of a sudden everything is needed 

1247
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:02,810
back on the western front.
Allenby is going to have his forces,

1248
01:20:02,811 --> 01:20:07,811
his best forces ripped from him and no 
reinforcements or extra force is added 

1249
01:20:07,811 --> 01:20:07,980
because all of

1250
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,980
a sudden,
just when everything looked like the 

1251
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:14,250
United States was going to come in and 
turn the tide of the war,

1252
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:19,850
the Germans attempt to turn the tide of 
the war first and we mentioned before 

1253
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:27,080
the real differences in sorted the feel 
and the ebb and the flow and the rhythm 

1254
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:31,970
of the two world wars.
The first and the second world wars in 

1255
01:20:31,970 --> 01:20:35,961
the Second World War.
There was a certain point where where 

1256
01:20:35,961 --> 01:20:36,720
the outcome of the war was no longer in 
doubt,

1257
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,680
but it was quite a ways between that 
moment and the end of the war,

1258
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:44,250
you know,
it's probably safe to say like late 19,

1259
01:20:44,251 --> 01:20:47,580
43,
everyone knows that the Germans in their

1260
01:20:47,581 --> 01:20:52,581
site or not winning that war,
no one knows how many people are going 

1261
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:52,770
to have to die before the outcome is 
finally settled,

1262
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,900
but everyone knows what the outcome's 
going to be.

1263
01:20:55,020 --> 01:21:00,020
You can concoct some real,
real long shots scenarios where the 

1264
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:03,591
Germans for example,
get atomic weapons first or something 

1265
01:21:03,591 --> 01:21:03,591
like that and change the course of 
history,

1266
01:21:03,591 --> 01:21:07,380
but by and large it was a moot point 
past a certain period,

1267
01:21:07,381 --> 01:21:08,340
probably late 43.

1268
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:10,200
As I said,
the first world war.

1269
01:21:10,201 --> 01:21:13,080
His rhythm was completely unlike that.
There were,

1270
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:18,700
you know,
if you wanted to say who had the 

1271
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:21,471
advantage.
Most of the time it was the allied 

1272
01:21:21,471 --> 01:21:22,950
forces continually putting their weight 
on the other side and wearing them down,

1273
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:27,780
but the other side led by Germany would 
strike out and lash out at certain times

1274
01:21:27,781 --> 01:21:29,680
with huge blows.
No,

1275
01:21:29,690 --> 01:21:32,010
that easily could have knocked the other
side out.

1276
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,540
The last of these Germany throws in 
early 19,

1277
01:21:36,541 --> 01:21:39,720
18.
Even the members of Germany's,

1278
01:21:39,721 --> 01:21:41,520
you know,
upper military caste.

1279
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:46,290
We're calling it the last card.
Now I have to set a few things up before

1280
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:49,200
we understand about this last card 
situation.

1281
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:52,230
The first is understanding where the war
is at this point.

1282
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:55,830
Germany's got some good stuff happening 
and some bad stuff happening.

1283
01:21:55,831 --> 01:21:59,820
We just mentioned one of the bad things.
The situation with their Turkish ally in

1284
01:21:59,821 --> 01:22:02,130
the Middle East is starting to turn for 
the worst,

1285
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:02,550
right?

1286
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:04,920
The latter part of 1917.
Not so great,

1287
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:10,670
but that is offset by good things that 
had been happening in that same time 

1288
01:22:10,670 --> 01:22:10,680
period.
We've said is so important.

1289
01:22:10,681 --> 01:22:11,580
October,
November,

1290
01:22:11,581 --> 01:22:12,960
December.
In 1917,

1291
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,440
the Germans send,
actually not that much,

1292
01:22:16,441 --> 01:22:21,441
but it made a big difference.
Some help to their austro-hungarian 

1293
01:22:21,441 --> 01:22:24,141
allies who have been fighting the 
Italians forever in the region of the 

1294
01:22:24,141 --> 01:22:28,461
river is Sanzo.
They have had 11 battles of the zero to 

1295
01:22:28,501 --> 01:22:33,501
this point in the war,
so you can tell how much things are 

1296
01:22:33,501 --> 01:22:33,501
moving.
Right?

1297
01:22:33,501 --> 01:22:35,700
It's a stalemate on these Alpine peaks 
and they're cutting,

1298
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:37,890
you know,
hideouts into the ice.

1299
01:22:37,891 --> 01:22:40,260
It's this crazy alpine war they're 
fighting,

1300
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:44,500
but both sides are really tired and the 
Italian troops are really tired of,

1301
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:46,290
of the guy who's been running the show 
for them,

1302
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:48,390
the general in charge of,
of their effort.

1303
01:22:48,391 --> 01:22:53,391
He's really sort of a stickler and 
they've had it with them and they and 

1304
01:22:53,391 --> 01:22:57,831
they've been like their austro-hungarian
enemies putting up with a lot for years 

1305
01:22:57,831 --> 01:22:58,980
and a lot of senseless deaths.

1306
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:00,240
It's just been,
it's been terrible.

1307
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:02,100
And then all of a sudden the German 
send,

1308
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,650
you know,
seven or eight divisions there to act as

1309
01:23:04,651 --> 01:23:09,651
sort of the edge of another offensive.
The twelfth I Sanzo but it gets known by

1310
01:23:10,811 --> 01:23:15,811
a different name because it stands out 
from the other 11 battles of the 

1311
01:23:15,811 --> 01:23:19,021
assault.
So it's often called the battle of 

1312
01:23:19,021 --> 01:23:19,021
corporate.
Righto.

1313
01:23:19,021 --> 01:23:22,170
And the reason it stands out from the 
other battles of the Assad is because 

1314
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:26,311
this time something decisive happens,
the Italians get smashed and who can 

1315
01:23:28,691 --> 01:23:31,690
blame them?
The Germans are once again using an even

1316
01:23:31,691 --> 01:23:36,340
more perfected version of new tactics 
and new artillery methods,

1317
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:37,810
you know,
as we said before,

1318
01:23:37,811 --> 01:23:41,140
what you're quickly watching occur in 
the four years of the first world war as

1319
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:45,400
you're watching these armies transform 
from something more like you know,

1320
01:23:45,401 --> 01:23:50,401
the Franco Prussian war in the 18 
seventies to something more like the 

1321
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:55,630
Second World War and you can see it as 
the tactics develop year after year from

1322
01:23:55,631 --> 01:24:00,631
stupidly walking into machine gun fire 
and ordered rows of men to wear 

1323
01:24:00,631 --> 01:24:01,120
infiltration.

1324
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:06,120
Tactics are taking over and you're 
beginning to see a lot of the same 

1325
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:09,630
methods being employed by these armies 
for the very first time that every army 

1326
01:24:09,630 --> 01:24:13,240
in the world still uses today involving 
fire and movement and mutual support and

1327
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:17,650
bypassing strong points.
When the Germans do this to the poor,

1328
01:24:17,651 --> 01:24:21,430
Italians and the Italians get,
I mean 300,000

1329
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:26,431
people surrender.
That's how bad it is and yet the 

1330
01:24:26,431 --> 01:24:28,780
Italians are able to move like 60 miles 
back.

1331
01:24:28,781 --> 01:24:32,740
Reform their lines keep from falling 
apart.

1332
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:34,510
Totally.
In a way it help for the British and the

1333
01:24:34,511 --> 01:24:39,511
French.
You have to take troops again from the 

1334
01:24:39,511 --> 01:24:39,640
western front to bolster this other 
area,

1335
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:44,641
but what it means is by the end of 1917,
the Germans have knocked out a bunch of 

1336
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:51,781
their opponents in this war.
When you look at how they started the 

1337
01:24:51,781 --> 01:24:53,170
war with all these enemies against them,
look at what they've done in 1915,

1338
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:58,171
they knock out Serbia in 1916,
they knock out Romania in 1917.

1339
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:04,740
They've just knocked out Russia from the
war and given Italy such a bloody lip 

1340
01:25:05,801 --> 01:25:10,801
that nothing is going to happen down 
there for awhile and now in early 1918 

1341
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:17,040
for the first time in the war,
the Germans face the British and the 

1342
01:25:17,111 --> 01:25:20,620
French without a whole lot of 
distractions.

1343
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:26,220
They don't have the Russians on the 
other side and they have a small window 

1344
01:25:27,761 --> 01:25:32,761
of opportunity before millions of 
Americans started arriving in Europe to 

1345
01:25:33,551 --> 01:25:38,551
swamp them.
This is the way Winston Churchill 

1346
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:42,730
describes the situation,
the setup we'll say,

1347
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:47,940
and then I'm going to contrast that with
the way adults Hitler does and remember 

1348
01:25:47,940 --> 01:25:51,430
that both of these people are writing to
specific audiences.

1349
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:55,630
Churchill's writing to people who are in
the,

1350
01:25:55,631 --> 01:25:58,200
especially British and American 
audiences and really,

1351
01:25:58,340 --> 01:26:00,010
you know,
a super patriotic,

1352
01:26:00,011 --> 01:26:05,011
romantic sort of an approach.
Hitler is writing this material for a 

1353
01:26:05,011 --> 01:26:09,191
bunch of bitter war veterans who still 
ache over what they experienced and and 

1354
01:26:11,181 --> 01:26:15,860
this feeling of betrayal and the 
bitterness since the war ended,

1355
01:26:15,861 --> 01:26:17,780
so they have different audiences they're
writing for,

1356
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:21,890
but contrasting their styles and the way
they set this up is intriguing.

1357
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:27,820
Here's how Churchill describes the 
situation and remember and remember the 

1358
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:31,331
end of 1917,
the British are still in shock from the 

1359
01:26:31,331 --> 01:26:33,190
battle that they still call passion.
Dale Churchill

1360
01:26:33,190 --> 01:26:33,730
says,
quote,

1361
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:40,480
as the passion Dale struggled,
died away in the storms and mud of 

1362
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:43,931
winter.
The military rulers of Germany address 

1363
01:26:43,931 --> 01:26:47,021
themselves to a new situation.
The collapse of Russia had enabled them 

1364
01:26:47,021 --> 01:26:51,041
to transport a million men and 3000 guns
from the eastern to the western front 

1365
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:53,510
for the first time.
Therefore,

1366
01:26:53,511 --> 01:26:58,511
since the invasion,
they found themselves possessed of a 

1367
01:26:58,511 --> 01:26:59,480
definite superiority over the allies in 
France,

1368
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:04,750
but the superiority was fleeting.
The United States had declared war and 

1369
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:05,780
was arming,
but had not yet arrived.

1370
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:09,410
Once the great masses of American 
manhood could be trained,

1371
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:11,090
equipped,
transported,

1372
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:16,180
and brought into the line of battle,
all the numerical advantage Germany had 

1373
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:18,830
gained from the destruction of Russia 
would be more than counterbalanced.

1374
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:21,650
At the same time,
the German main headquarters,

1375
01:27:21,651 --> 01:27:26,651
new the grave losses the British army 
had suffered at Passchendaele and felt 

1376
01:27:26,651 --> 01:27:30,761
themselves entitled to count upon a 
marked decline in its strength and 

1377
01:27:30,761 --> 01:27:31,700
fighting quality.
Lastly,

1378
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:36,820
the amazing character of the German 
Austrian victory over the Italians at 

1379
01:27:36,820 --> 01:27:39,970
corporate reddough glittered temptingly 
end quote.

1380
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:45,680
He then goes on to say it would have 
been a great time for the Germans to 

1381
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:46,640
open negotiations with us.
Instead,

1382
01:27:46,641 --> 01:27:47,780
they chose to attack

1383
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:51,940
and before we get to Hitler's view of 
the situation,

1384
01:27:51,941 --> 01:27:53,560
it's worth asking,
you know,

1385
01:27:53,561 --> 01:27:57,610
what were the Germans fighting for?
What did they hope to achieve?

1386
01:27:57,611 --> 01:28:02,350
What was the best case scenario in any 
sort of end to the war?

1387
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:07,530
And this is another difference between 
the first and the second world wars in 

1388
01:28:07,530 --> 01:28:10,801
the Second World War.
As soon as the Americans had said that 

1389
01:28:10,801 --> 01:28:14,100
unconditional surrender,
it was supposed to be the victory 

1390
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:15,190
conditions,
it made the war.

1391
01:28:15,191 --> 01:28:20,191
One of those conflicts where you're 
going to get what's called a 

1392
01:28:20,191 --> 01:28:20,191
carthaginian piece,
you know,

1393
01:28:20,191 --> 01:28:25,051
reminiscent of how the Romans in the 
third punic wars treated the city of 

1394
01:28:25,051 --> 01:28:26,620
Carthage,
total destruction,

1395
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:28,330
right?
The total occupation,

1396
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:33,510
total submission and domination,
unconditional surrender are the piece 

1397
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:37,651
turns and the first world war,
like so much of the stuff that went on 

1398
01:28:37,651 --> 01:28:41,731
during this time period,
the surrender was going to everyone 

1399
01:28:41,731 --> 01:28:42,980
presumed going to be some sort of a 
negotiated a.

1400
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:48,160
it's going to be a bargaining session 
and both sides are fighting to be the 

1401
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:50,380
superior person at the bargaining table,
right?

1402
01:28:50,381 --> 01:28:55,381
The one who can insist on better terms 
as general Ludendorff,

1403
01:28:55,621 --> 01:29:00,621
the German military leader points out 
what they're fighting for and why they 

1404
01:29:00,621 --> 01:29:01,530
have to keep attacking.
He quote,

1405
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:06,120
Germany could only make the enemy 
inclined to piece by fighting.

1406
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:11,000
It was first of all necessary to shake 
the position of Lloyd George and Clemen,

1407
01:29:11,001 --> 01:29:14,160
so by a military victory before that was
done.

1408
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:15,720
Piece was not to be thought of.

1409
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:17,020
End Quote.

1410
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:23,420
Now let's remember.
What ludendorff means is that he needs 

1411
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:24,900
this military victory to get the kind of
peace he wants.

1412
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:26,640
Write a piece that,
for example,

1413
01:29:26,641 --> 01:29:31,290
gives Germany either director or de 
facto control of places like Belgium for

1414
01:29:31,291 --> 01:29:36,291
example.
That's his bargaining position in any 

1415
01:29:36,291 --> 01:29:37,440
sort of agreement that ends the war.
That's what they're fighting for and the

1416
01:29:37,441 --> 01:29:42,441
other side is too,
although more and more one of the 

1417
01:29:42,441 --> 01:29:45,261
conditions that the Americans and the 
British and the French are insisting on 

1418
01:29:45,261 --> 01:29:46,560
is that the German form of government 
has to change.

1419
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:51,650
They can't be a monarchy anymore.
Well that may leave Germany still alive,

1420
01:29:51,991 --> 01:29:56,991
but it means if you are the emperor of 
Germany or any of these high ranking 

1421
01:29:56,991 --> 01:29:57,870
people that are a part of the German 
monarchy,

1422
01:29:58,350 --> 01:30:00,990
it might as well be total war against 
you.

1423
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:04,080
Germany may live on,
but you're not going to be a part of it.

1424
01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:08,430
Out of Hitler is a soldier in the first 
world war,

1425
01:30:08,431 --> 01:30:11,730
as we had mentioned earlier in his book,
Mine Comp,

1426
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:16,760
which is written for this German veteran
audience and postwar audience that we 

1427
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:20,751
mentioned a little earlier.
He talks about the sculptures and the 

1428
01:30:20,751 --> 01:30:24,441
sugars and all these people that are 
beginning to sort of stab the German 

1429
01:30:24,751 --> 01:30:27,120
army in the back.
From the home front,

1430
01:30:27,150 --> 01:30:29,660
that's the way it's portrayed and when 
you read lewd doors,

1431
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,730
a memoirs to written during a similar 
time period,

1432
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:37,910
he has the same thing going where you 
know the reason that the German troops 

1433
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:42,321
are in danger is not because the enemy 
will hurt them because they're sort of 

1434
01:30:42,321 --> 01:30:46,161
this victorious entity on the 
battlefield and it's because the home 

1435
01:30:46,161 --> 01:30:46,161
front,
we'll let them down.

1436
01:30:46,410 --> 01:30:51,410
And before you know Hitler's sums up the
situation that we're facing right here 

1437
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:55,221
at the beginning of 1918,
he goes off on some strikes that are 

1438
01:30:55,221 --> 01:30:57,630
taking place during this time period in 
Germany.

1439
01:30:58,170 --> 01:31:01,050
There's a naval strike that happens in 
1917.

1440
01:31:01,170 --> 01:31:06,170
That's disconcerting.
And then several hundred thousand 

1441
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:09,510
munitions workers go on strike right at 
the beginning of the new year in 1918.

1442
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:11,280
And,
and again,

1443
01:31:11,281 --> 01:31:14,100
when the German government punishes the 
ringleaders of the strikes,

1444
01:31:14,101 --> 01:31:16,110
they send them to the front as 
punishment,

1445
01:31:16,111 --> 01:31:21,111
but that means that they're infiltrating
now these military units and they're 

1446
01:31:21,111 --> 01:31:24,621
infiltrating them with these ideas that 
Luton Dorff and Hitler Tie right to 

1447
01:31:24,931 --> 01:31:27,330
Bolshevism.
And Hitler ties Bolshevism by the way,

1448
01:31:27,331 --> 01:31:27,960
the Jews.

1449
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:34,160
So right there you begin to see the 
origins of the stab in the back theory,

1450
01:31:34,161 --> 01:31:36,890
right,
and here's the way Hitler in his,

1451
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:38,360
in his.
Well,

1452
01:31:38,361 --> 01:31:40,190
what are you going to say?
Bestselling book,

1453
01:31:40,191 --> 01:31:44,830
Mine comp describes the situation the 
Germans found themselves in after they'd

1454
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:47,120
given the Italians the bloody nose at 
corporate rental,

1455
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:52,240
after they've knocked all these other 
people out of the war and after finding 

1456
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:52,240
out you know that they're going to 
attack

1457
01:31:53,210 --> 01:31:53,560
quote

1458
01:31:55,110 --> 01:32:00,110
toward the end of 1917,
the low point of the army's seems to 

1459
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:02,950
have passed.
The whole army took fresh hope and fresh

1460
01:32:02,951 --> 01:32:04,690
courage.
After the Russian collapse,

1461
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:10,020
the conviction that the war would end 
with the victory of Germany after all 

1462
01:32:10,020 --> 01:32:12,160
began to seize the troops more and more 
again,

1463
01:32:12,161 --> 01:32:16,870
singing could be heard and the calamity 
Jane's became rarer again,

1464
01:32:16,871 --> 01:32:20,530
people believed in the future of the 
father land and the quote,

1465
01:32:21,630 --> 01:32:26,630
the calamity Jane are these sculptures 
and shirkers and people who say anti 

1466
01:32:26,630 --> 01:32:29,760
patriotic things or or negative things 
about the war effort.

1467
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:30,870
He says,
quote,

1468
01:32:31,230 --> 01:32:33,900
especially the Italian collapse of 
autumn,

1469
01:32:33,901 --> 01:32:38,280
1917 had had the most wonderful effect 
in this victory.

1470
01:32:38,370 --> 01:32:43,370
We saw proof of the possibility of 
breaking through the front even aside 

1471
01:32:43,370 --> 01:32:47,541
from the Russian theater of war,
a glorious faith float again into the 

1472
01:32:47,541 --> 01:32:49,830
hearts of the millions,
enabled them to await spring 19,

1473
01:32:49,831 --> 01:32:54,831
18 with relief and confidence.
The photo was visibly depressed in this 

1474
01:32:55,860 --> 01:32:57,780
winter.
He remained quieter than usual.

1475
01:32:57,930 --> 01:33:01,050
This was the lull before the storm and 
quote

1476
01:33:02,630 --> 01:33:07,630
than Hitler sums up his view of this 
moment and what the allies were facing 

1477
01:33:08,121 --> 01:33:10,550
now with a sort of Germany unleashed.
He says,

1478
01:33:10,551 --> 01:33:15,551
quote in the winter of 1917 to 1918,
dark clouds appeared for the first time 

1479
01:33:16,701 --> 01:33:20,040
in the firmament of the allied world for
nearly four years.

1480
01:33:20,041 --> 01:33:22,220
They had been assailing the German 
warrior,

1481
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:25,670
and had been unable to encompass his 
downfall and all this.

1482
01:33:25,671 --> 01:33:28,910
While the German had only his shield arm
free for defense.

1483
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:32,570
While the sword was obliged to strike 
now in the east,

1484
01:33:32,630 --> 01:33:34,850
now in the south,
but now at last,

1485
01:33:34,851 --> 01:33:39,851
the giants back was free.
Streams of blood had flown before he 

1486
01:33:39,851 --> 01:33:41,330
administered final defeat to one of his 
foes.

1487
01:33:41,570 --> 01:33:46,570
Now in the West.
He Shield was going to be joined by his 

1488
01:33:46,570 --> 01:33:46,570
sword.
Up until then,

1489
01:33:46,570 --> 01:33:51,221
the enemy had been unable to break his 
defense and now he himself was facing 

1490
01:33:51,221 --> 01:33:55,781
attack.
The enemy feared him and trembled for 

1491
01:33:55,781 --> 01:33:56,480
their victory and the quote

1492
01:33:58,180 --> 01:33:59,080
no,
in one sense,

1493
01:33:59,081 --> 01:34:04,081
this is a post first world war,
Hitler putting a rosy picture on this 

1494
01:34:04,081 --> 01:34:04,450
thing,
you know,

1495
01:34:04,451 --> 01:34:08,680
with peer we were going to defeat them 
and then stabbed in the back by the Jews

1496
01:34:08,681 --> 01:34:09,610
and Bolsheviks.
Right?

1497
01:34:09,970 --> 01:34:14,970
But at the same time,
there's some truth to a couple of these 

1498
01:34:14,970 --> 01:34:14,970
things.
One,

1499
01:34:14,970 --> 01:34:19,920
the Bolsheviks were having an influence 
on Germany and that attempt by Ludin 

1500
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:23,130
Dorf to,
you know,

1501
01:34:23,131 --> 01:34:28,131
get rid of his next door neighbor in the
apartment complex by burning his 

1502
01:34:28,131 --> 01:34:31,000
apartment down is beginning to change 
Germany a little bit in Luton.

1503
01:34:31,001 --> 01:34:33,280
Dorf writes about this in his memoirs in
a way,

1504
01:34:33,370 --> 01:34:36,490
remember writing years later so we can 
pretend to have hindsight.

1505
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:39,880
He basically acts like he understood the
risk was dangerous.

1506
01:34:39,970 --> 01:34:44,380
He thought they could contain the 
Bolshevik intellectual contagion,

1507
01:34:44,381 --> 01:34:49,381
but he knew that there was a chance it 
wouldn't work out that way and there's 

1508
01:34:49,381 --> 01:34:53,161
something to that in terms of why the 
Germans were all of a sudden beginning 

1509
01:34:53,161 --> 01:34:57,451
to start to show real cracks in the 
facade of the home front and some of 

1510
01:34:59,701 --> 01:35:01,470
these people,
it should be pointed out that a guy like

1511
01:35:01,471 --> 01:35:03,360
Luton door for Hitler,
things are Bolsheviks,

1512
01:35:03,810 --> 01:35:06,720
are probably more like Social Democrats,
you know,

1513
01:35:06,721 --> 01:35:09,960
mild socialists,
but to a guy like lewd Neidorf,

1514
01:35:09,961 --> 01:35:14,961
anyone who's thinking that the war might
have gone on too long or that Germany 

1515
01:35:14,961 --> 01:35:19,371
instead of an emperor might do better 
with a representative democracy or a 

1516
01:35:19,371 --> 01:35:21,300
republic or something.
That to them is traitorous and radical,

1517
01:35:21,301 --> 01:35:23,250
so you might as well be a Bolshevik

1518
01:35:24,670 --> 01:35:29,670
nonetheless,
think about what these people are going 

1519
01:35:29,670 --> 01:35:29,670
through.
Four years of war.

1520
01:35:29,670 --> 01:35:33,180
All these countries in a sense,
sacrificing their future with each 

1521
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:37,231
generation of youngsters that they call 
up and throw into the mall and they're 

1522
01:35:37,231 --> 01:35:41,611
sacrificing their past to.
They're cannibalizing their country's 

1523
01:35:41,860 --> 01:35:44,110
historical in longterm assets.

1524
01:35:45,510 --> 01:35:48,750
We've quoted the English wife of a 
German nobleman princess blue shirt.

1525
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:50,790
Evelyn Belushi,
writing in her diary,

1526
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:54,210
she told this story that is just 
heartbreaking about,

1527
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:59,420
you know,
the fact that the Germans don't have 

1528
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:00,771
enough ammunition anymore and they're 
starting to go into the society and and 

1529
01:36:00,771 --> 01:36:04,641
take things to meltdown.
One historian I read said that during 

1530
01:36:04,641 --> 01:36:09,171
this period more than 10,000
church bells were melted down and 

1531
01:36:09,171 --> 01:36:10,770
princess blueshift tells a story about 
that.

1532
01:36:10,890 --> 01:36:11,910
She says,
quote,

1533
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:17,540
there are other signs too pathetic in 
their way of the increasing scarcity of 

1534
01:36:17,551 --> 01:36:22,380
metal for everywhere the old church 
bells and even the organ pipes are being

1535
01:36:22,381 --> 01:36:25,470
dragged from the churches and turned 
into ammunition.

1536
01:36:25,710 --> 01:36:26,250
Wilson,
oh,

1537
01:36:26,251 --> 01:36:29,130
into the scarcity of oil.
The sanctuary lamp,

1538
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:34,220
such a dear familiar sight in Catholic 
churches may no longer shed it's tender 

1539
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:36,990
light before the tabernacle in a small 
town near here.

1540
01:36:37,170 --> 01:36:39,810
A sad little ceremony took place the 
other day.

1541
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:45,050
The Ancient Church Bell,
which had rung the people from the 

1542
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:48,141
cradle to the grave for 300 years and 
more was requisitioned by the military 

1543
01:36:48,141 --> 01:36:51,420
authorities.
The grief felt by the inhabitants was so

1544
01:36:51,421 --> 01:36:56,421
great that they determined to do their 
ancient friend all the honor they could 

1545
01:36:56,421 --> 01:36:59,010
and after having performed the regular 
funeral service for the debt over it,

1546
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:04,250
a procession was formed,
headed by the priest in his vestments 

1547
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:08,360
and his acolytes,
swinging their incense and the 

1548
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:10,821
inhabitants following the bell,
which was covered with wreaths and 

1549
01:37:10,821 --> 01:37:14,361
flowers and hand it over to the military
authorities under tiers and 

1550
01:37:14,361 --> 01:37:18,231
protestations and quote.
I look at that story is kind of symbolic

1551
01:37:19,281 --> 01:37:24,281
of you know the greatness of old Europe 
at the height and the high water marks 

1552
01:37:24,281 --> 01:37:28,621
if its wealth and civilization and 
hundreds of years of glorious past 

1553
01:37:29,721 --> 01:37:34,721
behind them sort of girding the whole 
society being ripped apart and thrown 

1554
01:37:36,231 --> 01:37:41,231
into the mall and the furnace to provide
the implements that are needed to fight 

1555
01:37:41,231 --> 01:37:45,860
the war that is destroying its high 
place on the world stage.

1556
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:51,380
This is a sort of tragic irony that 
isn't confined to Germany.

1557
01:37:51,381 --> 01:37:56,381
By the way.
This is how Britain and France and 

1558
01:37:56,381 --> 01:37:56,381
Russia and all these old line powers 
kind of.

1559
01:37:56,381 --> 01:37:58,890
They're trapped in this conflict now 
that is chewing up their wealth,

1560
01:37:59,610 --> 01:38:02,340
destabilizing the structures of their 
society,

1561
01:38:02,341 --> 01:38:07,341
and once again,
taking the next class of draftees who 

1562
01:38:07,341 --> 01:38:10,791
reach now,
18 years old and throwing them into the 

1563
01:38:10,791 --> 01:38:14,661
meat grinder to think of the pressure on
these people who are commanding all 

1564
01:38:14,661 --> 01:38:16,620
these armies on,
on both sides.

1565
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:22,040
I mean Ludin door if you can't help but 
think about this guy because he's the 

1566
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:23,820
one who gets to decide how you play 
Germany's last card,

1567
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:25,560
the central powers,
last card.

1568
01:38:25,561 --> 01:38:30,561
Think of the people that are counting on
him from a completely human experiment.

1569
01:38:30,931 --> 01:38:35,931
Imagine the stress and responsibility 
that falls on this one guy shoulders 

1570
01:38:36,301 --> 01:38:41,301
more than anyone else on that side.
Obviously he's got help and staffs and 

1571
01:38:41,301 --> 01:38:41,730
you know other people to consultant what
have you,

1572
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:46,080
but basically the number one person's 
responsibility is his.

1573
01:38:47,730 --> 01:38:52,730
He's got to plan the biggest battle in 
world history and the stakes are 

1574
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,760
everything.
Wow.

1575
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,330
This is the biggest encounter between,
you know,

1576
01:39:03,331 --> 01:39:08,331
the cutting edge militaries of the world
that has ever happened and that's what 

1577
01:39:08,331 --> 01:39:11,751
Ludendorff is planning and it's an 
immensely complicated affair with with 

1578
01:39:11,751 --> 01:39:12,720
details beyond belief

1579
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:19,190
mean Luton.
Dorf will start moving troops from the 

1580
01:39:19,190 --> 01:39:23,331
eastern front who had been fighting the 
Russians on trains all the way over to 

1581
01:39:23,331 --> 01:39:24,540
the west before the Russians even sign a
peace treaty.

1582
01:39:25,410 --> 01:39:28,590
By the spring of 1918,
he's moved a million German soldiers who

1583
01:39:28,591 --> 01:39:33,591
had been fighting the Russians over to 
the West where they can now be used 

1584
01:39:33,591 --> 01:39:35,100
against the French and the British,
the German army in the West.

1585
01:39:35,101 --> 01:39:40,101
Numbers over 3 million soldiers by 
spring 1918 and Luton Dorf has a plan 

1586
01:39:41,761 --> 01:39:43,170
that he's going to,
you know,

1587
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:48,200
put into place that that involves 
throwing multiple punches at the French 

1588
01:39:48,331 --> 01:39:53,331
and the British like a five punch 
combination and he's going to use about 

1589
01:39:53,331 --> 01:39:57,500
a million soldiers to form the fist.
Michael named after St Michael is the 

1590
01:39:58,621 --> 01:40:03,621
first of these punches,
but the entire affair will sometimes be 

1591
01:40:03,621 --> 01:40:07,191
called the 1918 spring offensive.
The German soldiers referred to it.

1592
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:10,710
Sometimes it's just a great battle in 
France that shows you how big it's going

1593
01:40:10,711 --> 01:40:12,330
to be.
One part of it,

1594
01:40:12,350 --> 01:40:14,550
sometimes referred to as the peace 
offensive,

1595
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:18,630
and sometimes the entire affair is 
called the Kaiser Schlock.

1596
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:24,280
The emperor's battle.
Historians have been fascinated by these

1597
01:40:24,281 --> 01:40:27,790
series of battles ever since for a 
couple of major reasons.

1598
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:32,410
One is the scope and the other other 
stakes.

1599
01:40:33,670 --> 01:40:35,920
This is the largest battle the world's 
ever seen.

1600
01:40:35,921 --> 01:40:40,921
The complexity is unbelievable.
I mean it's very hard battle to follow 

1601
01:40:40,921 --> 01:40:44,440
or explain or talk about it in the front
will be miles long.

1602
01:40:44,441 --> 01:40:49,441
It will involve millions of men.
The complexity in terms of trying to 

1603
01:40:50,471 --> 01:40:54,160
plan and arrange and get ready for one

1604
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,070
of these big offensives in five or six 
months,

1605
01:40:57,100 --> 01:41:02,100
which is your planning window is perhaps
the most complex task human beings have 

1606
01:41:03,461 --> 01:41:08,461
ever attempted to tackle.
I think you could say that there are 

1607
01:41:08,461 --> 01:41:11,290
bigger things like trying to create a 
global society,

1608
01:41:11,291 --> 01:41:12,640
which we're in the process of doing 
right now.

1609
01:41:12,641 --> 01:41:17,641
That's very hard,
but you can do that over time and build 

1610
01:41:17,641 --> 01:41:19,690
on the achievements of previous 
generations and sort of evolve towards a

1611
01:41:19,691 --> 01:41:23,410
solution to a complex problem.
These people have a time window and it's

1612
01:41:23,411 --> 01:41:28,411
short.
Get the Kaiser schlock done within five 

1613
01:41:28,411 --> 01:41:31,921
months.
Boom's got to be ready on the 21st of 

1614
01:41:31,921 --> 01:41:31,921
March.
Boom.

1615
01:41:31,921 --> 01:41:34,231
Get it done.
I mean just the attempts to keep the 

1616
01:41:34,231 --> 01:41:37,780
allies in the dark about where it's 
coming are complex as heck.

1617
01:41:38,290 --> 01:41:43,290
I mean,
they will move troops and equipment at 

1618
01:41:43,290 --> 01:41:45,031
night.
They will cover up the artillery gun 

1619
01:41:45,031 --> 01:41:45,610
wheels with cloth so you can't hear 
them.

1620
01:41:45,790 --> 01:41:49,280
They will roused out the civilian 
population and all these towns and March

1621
01:41:49,281 --> 01:41:51,130
them around in all directions to 
confuse,

1622
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:52,810
you know,
allied observers,

1623
01:41:54,510 --> 01:41:58,590
they will scramble and use false radio 
messages and just because you know,

1624
01:41:58,591 --> 01:42:02,160
this is sort of a transition period in 
history just to cover all their bases.

1625
01:42:02,161 --> 01:42:04,470
They will also pull out the carrier 
pigeons,

1626
01:42:04,710 --> 01:42:08,730
including carrier pigeons,
captured from the other side,

1627
01:42:09,030 --> 01:42:11,550
put false notes in the little 
compartment,

1628
01:42:11,910 --> 01:42:14,040
you know,
in their leg and send them off.

1629
01:42:15,150 --> 01:42:17,010
That's called covering all your bases,
isn't it?

1630
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:21,150
But think of the planning and complexity
and all the work that goes on.

1631
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:26,130
The other fascinating aspect to 
historians are the stakes.

1632
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:31,470
When do you have stakes like this?
The biggest war and human history,

1633
01:42:31,800 --> 01:42:36,800
and as one historian put it,
Ludina door from the Germans have six 

1634
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:37,680
months to change the course of the war 
here.

1635
01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:43,070
After that,
the numerical advantage the Americans 

1636
01:42:43,070 --> 01:42:46,131
will provide will be overwhelming.
So you have this window of opportunity 

1637
01:42:46,131 --> 01:42:50,330
and it's an all or nothing thing.
My southern historians have argued that 

1638
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:51,150
the Germans should have just gone on the
defensive here,

1639
01:42:51,151 --> 01:42:56,151
dug in and made the allied forces fight 
until 1920 or 1921,

1640
01:42:58,420 --> 01:43:03,420
um,
before the mounting losses would force 

1641
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:03,420
them into some sort of a favorable 
piece.

1642
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:05,940
But that kind of ignores how bad things 
are on the home front,

1643
01:43:05,941 --> 01:43:10,941
right?
Even if the German army can withstand 

1644
01:43:10,941 --> 01:43:11,400
these allied attacks,
they're going to lose the people back at

1645
01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:14,730
home for a year past the infamous turnip
winter.

1646
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:17,190
What happens when the turnip winter is 
the good old days,

1647
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:19,860
right?
Pollutant or from the Germans.

1648
01:43:19,861 --> 01:43:22,830
Don't just put this attack together.
They're excited about it.

1649
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:26,670
The German troops are almost ecstatic.
The morale is sky high.

1650
01:43:26,671 --> 01:43:30,570
They want a chance to win the war.
This is why this first punch operation,

1651
01:43:30,571 --> 01:43:35,571
Michael,
is so important because this is the 

1652
01:43:35,571 --> 01:43:35,571
punch where all the optimism is in 
place,

1653
01:43:35,571 --> 01:43:37,050
right?
Everybody's drinking the Koolaid.

1654
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:42,450
Luton Dorf decides to,
you know up his gamble ante a little bit

1655
01:43:42,451 --> 01:43:47,451
more.
Not only is he gambling with this 

1656
01:43:47,451 --> 01:43:47,451
attack,
but he's going to,

1657
01:43:47,451 --> 01:43:50,970
you know,
essentially pull out the rocket fuel 

1658
01:43:50,970 --> 01:43:53,930
from the great mass of he goes through 
and calms his army for the best man,

1659
01:43:54,321 --> 01:43:59,321
right?
The healthiest and strongest that ones 

1660
01:43:59,321 --> 01:43:59,321
are the highest morale.
The veterans who weren't cynical yet,

1661
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:04,480
all these people who are better than the
rest of the herd and pulls them out and 

1662
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:06,560
puts them into special units and gives 
them the best weapons.

1663
01:44:06,561 --> 01:44:11,561
Again,
pulled away from the great mass of 

1664
01:44:11,561 --> 01:44:12,080
people and the special training,
what they called special training.

1665
01:44:12,081 --> 01:44:17,081
In the first world war today,
we would call standard training in a 

1666
01:44:17,081 --> 01:44:18,200
modern military.
They called them storm trooper tactics.

1667
01:44:18,201 --> 01:44:23,201
We call them fire and move tactics,
and every army in the world uses them 

1668
01:44:23,201 --> 01:44:24,740
now.
Nonetheless,

1669
01:44:24,741 --> 01:44:28,520
what Ludendorff has done here is create 
an initial advantage,

1670
01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:33,770
you know,
for himself because his best troops are 

1671
01:44:33,770 --> 01:44:36,401
going to go up against the great mass of
French and British troops that they run 

1672
01:44:36,401 --> 01:44:36,401
into.

1673
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:41,170
They will give out the lion's share of 
casualties to the French and the British

1674
01:44:41,171 --> 01:44:43,810
and the allies,
but they will also take the lion's share

1675
01:44:43,811 --> 01:44:48,280
of casualties.
This is a gamble because when Ludin Dorf

1676
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:53,320
uses these best troops,
he's going to use them up and if they 

1677
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:57,001
haven't won by that point,
he's going to be left with the not best 

1678
01:44:57,001 --> 01:45:01,470
troops,
the leftovers people who've had their 

1679
01:45:01,470 --> 01:45:02,970
best weapons stripped from them and 
given to the other guys.

1680
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:05,140
People who haven't been trained in the 
latest tactics,

1681
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:09,820
people who would expect it are going to 
simply move up and occupied the trenches

1682
01:45:09,821 --> 01:45:14,620
that have already been conquered.
It's a Campbell and on March 21st.

1683
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:19,920
It's not a gamble Ludina and has to 
worry about because he's got all these 

1684
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:21,630
storm trooper and assault units.
You know,

1685
01:45:21,631 --> 01:45:26,631
waiting for the moment to jump off,
synchronizing their watches and waiting 

1686
01:45:27,341 --> 01:45:32,341
for what will be the largest cannonade 
in history to kickoff on March 21st 

1687
01:45:35,111 --> 01:45:40,111
operation,
Michael begins the first punch of the 

1688
01:45:40,111 --> 01:45:42,271
German multi punch combination aimed 
primarily at the British.

1689
01:45:44,110 --> 01:45:49,110
Some 10,000
artillery pieces will open fire at about

1690
01:45:49,541 --> 01:45:51,250
dawn.
Somewhere in the 4:00

1691
01:45:51,251 --> 01:45:51,700
hour

1692
01:45:53,950 --> 01:45:58,000
they will only fire only it's forever.
If you're under fire,

1693
01:45:58,001 --> 01:46:03,001
they'll only fire for about four hours.
It's what's called a hurricane 

1694
01:46:03,001 --> 01:46:03,640
bombardment.
Very different than what the allies were

1695
01:46:03,641 --> 01:46:08,641
doing through most of the war where they
will bombard for weeks on end sometimes 

1696
01:46:08,641 --> 01:46:11,890
right at the Somme in 1916.
The big artillery battle,

1697
01:46:11,891 --> 01:46:16,891
they'll fire one point 7 million shells 
in the first week and it's famous 

1698
01:46:16,891 --> 01:46:17,080
because,
oh my gosh,

1699
01:46:17,081 --> 01:46:22,081
think of how many shells that is,
but every first world war major 

1700
01:46:22,081 --> 01:46:22,590
offensive outdoes,
the earlier ones in,

1701
01:46:22,591 --> 01:46:24,280
in this one,
they fire,

1702
01:46:24,370 --> 01:46:29,370
you know,
becomes a contest like a statistic in 

1703
01:46:29,370 --> 01:46:29,380
the Guinness Book of World Records,
but they fire one point,

1704
01:46:29,381 --> 01:46:34,381
1 million shells in four hours and it's 
conducted like a symphony of death.

1705
01:46:36,610 --> 01:46:39,250
The Germans had brought in all of their 
big,

1706
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:42,700
I guess you could call the military 
stars to this battle.

1707
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:48,120
One of them is this artillery conductor,
Georg Brooke Miller,

1708
01:46:48,401 --> 01:46:51,810
I think his name,
but his nickname is breakthrough mueller

1709
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:57,740
and he has a whole theory and that he's 
been perfecting on how to use these 

1710
01:46:57,740 --> 01:47:00,621
artillery barrages and part of his 
theory involves the idea that you don't 

1711
01:47:00,621 --> 01:47:03,510
need to destroy the enemy positions,
which is what it's always been done.

1712
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:07,020
All you need to do is neutralize them 
all you need to do with that machine gun

1713
01:47:07,021 --> 01:47:12,021
nest to stop them from shooting long 
enough so that the infantry doesn't get 

1714
01:47:12,021 --> 01:47:13,920
killed on the way to taking out the 
machine gun nest themselves.

1715
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:19,550
So he uses a lot more gas first of all,
and he has a whole order that all this 

1716
01:47:20,341 --> 01:47:21,150
comes into me.
First.

1717
01:47:21,151 --> 01:47:23,490
He shoots the gas.
That doesn't kill you,

1718
01:47:23,491 --> 01:47:28,491
but it's like tear gas.
It makes you gag and vomit and it makes 

1719
01:47:28,491 --> 01:47:31,791
you rip off your gas masks,
but then he hits you with the phosgene 

1720
01:47:31,791 --> 01:47:33,510
gas that if you're not wearing your gas 
mask kills you.

1721
01:47:34,570 --> 01:47:37,860
He'll also use mustard gas,
which is a long lasting,

1722
01:47:37,861 --> 01:47:42,861
so it's like spraying the the ant spray 
that will still kill the ants a week 

1723
01:47:42,861 --> 01:47:43,200
later,
even though it's dried up,

1724
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:48,560
the mustard gas is shot at all these 
important crossroads and areas and 

1725
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:52,791
heights and observation posts so that 
either you get out or you're so covered 

1726
01:47:53,071 --> 01:47:58,071
up and gas masks and everything,
you can hardly function and the Germans 

1727
01:47:58,071 --> 01:47:58,320
just want you to be impeded,
right.

1728
01:47:58,320 --> 01:48:03,320
You just have to be not functioning long
enough for the waves of German soldiers 

1729
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:06,000
to be free and clear to overrun your 
physicians.

1730
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:12,020
It also has the added benefit of not 
making the terrain in front of your 

1731
01:48:12,020 --> 01:48:15,480
advancing troops look like the cratered 
surface of the moon.

1732
01:48:16,770 --> 01:48:20,520
Large shell craters have become a 
barrier all its own in previous battles.

1733
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:25,880
In this one,
the German artillery was going to 

1734
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:27,861
minimize that.
Keep the way open for a quick and 

1735
01:48:27,861 --> 01:48:31,311
shocking advance.
The artillery opens fire on March 21st.

1736
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:37,910
You know,
it's strange to say that they're 

1737
01:48:37,910 --> 01:48:37,910
surprised because everyone knew this was
coming,

1738
01:48:37,910 --> 01:48:39,720
but the surprises in the intensity and 
the locations and whatnot,

1739
01:48:40,350 --> 01:48:45,350
the Kaiser,
the emperor of Germany and the face of 

1740
01:48:45,350 --> 01:48:48,801
the German military,
Hindenburg or reportedly at the battle 

1741
01:48:48,801 --> 01:48:52,610
and the Kaiser was known to have this 
wooden tower that's sort of like a 

1742
01:48:52,610 --> 01:48:54,810
ranger station erected so he could try 
to see a battle,

1743
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:57,780
which was something that in the 19th 
century wouldn't have been that strange.

1744
01:48:57,780 --> 01:49:02,780
People came out with picnic baskets in 
the first major battle of the US civil 

1745
01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:07,131
war to watch and the Kaiser and 
Hindenburg were supposedly at this 

1746
01:49:07,171 --> 01:49:12,171
battle to watch it unfold.
Winston Churchill was also there when 

1747
01:49:12,171 --> 01:49:16,041
the cannonade opened up and you get this
feeling that he's a [inaudible] figure 

1748
01:49:16,041 --> 01:49:18,000
that he's just not gonna miss any big 
historical event.

1749
01:49:18,001 --> 01:49:23,001
If he can avoid that.
And he was at this battle too and he 

1750
01:49:23,001 --> 01:49:24,690
gives one of the original and much 
quoted accounts of what it was like.

1751
01:49:24,691 --> 01:49:25,200
He said,
you know,

1752
01:49:25,201 --> 01:49:30,201
he was walking around and everyone was 
waiting for something to happen and he 

1753
01:49:30,201 --> 01:49:30,240
woke up from his sleep somewhere in the 
4:00

1754
01:49:30,241 --> 01:49:35,241
hour and who's relatively silent,
and then boom quote.

1755
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:39,390
Suddenly after what seemed about a half 
an hour,

1756
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:44,040
the silence was broken by six or seven 
very loud and very heavy explosion.

1757
01:49:44,041 --> 01:49:47,470
Several miles away.
I thought they were are 12 inch guns,

1758
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:48,040
but they were

1759
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:53,040
probably mines and then exactly as a 
pianist runs his hand across the 

1760
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:56,500
keyboard from treble to base their rows 
and less than one minute.

1761
01:49:56,650 --> 01:50:00,550
The most tremendous cannonade I shall 
ever here and quote.

1762
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:06,960
He said that quote,
the weight and intensity of the 

1763
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:08,140
bombardment surpassed anything which 
anyone had ever known before,

1764
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:14,200
and to quote Ernst Junger,
the German soldier we've talked about 

1765
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:16,270
sometimes in the story is also at this 
battle.

1766
01:50:16,810 --> 01:50:21,810
He's on the opposite side of the 
shelling rights and not even the side 

1767
01:50:21,810 --> 01:50:25,201
that's being shelled and he says that it
made every other event he'd been to in 

1768
01:50:25,201 --> 01:50:26,320
this war,
looked like a tea party,

1769
01:50:26,321 --> 01:50:28,930
and he was at many of the big battles,
right?

1770
01:50:29,530 --> 01:50:34,530
A tea party.
He said that the shelling seemed to 

1771
01:50:34,530 --> 01:50:36,880
suspend the laws of nature.
He said,

1772
01:50:36,881 --> 01:50:41,881
you know,
you couldn't light a match or anything 

1773
01:50:41,881 --> 01:50:43,591
because the shock waves,
even as far away as the German troops 

1774
01:50:43,591 --> 01:50:43,591
were,
would blow it right out.

1775
01:50:43,630 --> 01:50:48,630
He says that if you looked over to the 
enemy lines I'll use saw is rolling 

1776
01:50:48,630 --> 01:50:52,471
clouds of flame and it looked like the 
way the desert looks when you look in 

1777
01:50:52,481 --> 01:50:55,660
the distance and the heat is shimmering 
and makes you almost see Mirages.

1778
01:50:55,661 --> 01:50:57,880
He said that that's what it looks like.
You know,

1779
01:50:58,030 --> 01:51:03,030
on the side of the people being shelled.
The effect on the British troops is 

1780
01:51:04,211 --> 01:51:09,211
almost like being punched drunk.
A private in the first West Yorkshire 

1781
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:12,700
Regiment who was there explained it this
way,

1782
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:15,790
quote,
nobody could stand more than three hours

1783
01:51:15,791 --> 01:51:19,150
of sustained shelling before they 
started feeling sleepy and numb.

1784
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:22,660
You're hammered after three hours and 
you're there for the picking.

1785
01:51:22,661 --> 01:51:27,661
When he comes over,
it's a bit like being under an 

1786
01:51:27,661 --> 01:51:30,151
anesthetic.
You can't put a lot of resistance up on 

1787
01:51:30,151 --> 01:51:31,900
the other fronts I'd been on.
There had been so much of our resistance

1788
01:51:31,901 --> 01:51:36,901
that whenever Jerry opened up,
our artillery opened up and quieted him 

1789
01:51:36,901 --> 01:51:37,930
down,
but there was no retaliation.

1790
01:51:37,930 --> 01:51:41,530
This time he had a free do at us and to 
quote,

1791
01:51:42,670 --> 01:51:47,020
I should point out that the Germans 
called the British Tommy and the British

1792
01:51:47,021 --> 01:51:50,290
called the Germans Jerry often,
so that's how that happens.

1793
01:51:51,700 --> 01:51:55,870
Historian Alexander Watson quotes a 
German battalion,

1794
01:51:55,871 --> 01:52:00,871
Dr Ernst determine who recorded that men
reacted to shelling quote for the most 

1795
01:52:01,841 --> 01:52:05,540
part with the feeling of enormous 
sleepiness and quote,

1796
01:52:05,930 --> 01:52:10,930
and then said that you get both 
emotional and physical changes in men 

1797
01:52:10,930 --> 01:52:15,481
who are being shelled.
So think about the people on the 

1798
01:52:15,481 --> 01:52:17,851
receiving end of what's about to be a 
ground attack after they've experienced 

1799
01:52:17,851 --> 01:52:19,810
something that does this to them,
Witterman says,

1800
01:52:19,811 --> 01:52:23,020
quote,
the eyes pop out of their sockets.

1801
01:52:23,260 --> 01:52:28,260
The expression becomes fixed and glassy.
The facial skin loses all of its red 

1802
01:52:28,451 --> 01:52:30,700
color.
The skin becomes yellow,

1803
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:34,720
the cheekbones protrude.
The lifts are shut tight and sticky,

1804
01:52:34,721 --> 01:52:37,300
spittle tax up the tongue to the roof of
the mouth.

1805
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:40,300
The heart works in short convulsive 
beats.

1806
01:52:40,540 --> 01:52:43,120
Breathing becomes slower from time to 
time.

1807
01:52:43,121 --> 01:52:45,950
A cold shutter runs through the body and
the teeth chatter,

1808
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:51,160
every spoken word is felt as agony and 
quote Watson goes to point out that 

1809
01:52:52,731 --> 01:52:57,731
surveys had shown that the troops were 
particularly scared of artillery and 

1810
01:52:57,731 --> 01:52:59,830
unsettled by it.
He writes,

1811
01:52:59,831 --> 01:53:00,190
quote,

1812
01:53:01,770 --> 01:53:06,770
not only did artillery cause more 
casualties than any other weapon on the 

1813
01:53:06,770 --> 01:53:08,010
western front,
but those injuries that it did inflict.

1814
01:53:08,011 --> 01:53:13,011
We're often grievous.
Contemporary psychiatrist agreed that 

1815
01:53:13,011 --> 01:53:16,800
men's primary fear was not death,
but mutilation wounds to the stomach,

1816
01:53:16,801 --> 01:53:21,801
jaw and dyes were particularly dreaded.
It is that significant that artillery 

1817
01:53:21,801 --> 01:53:24,540
fire was more likely than any other 
weapon to cause head wounds.

1818
01:53:24,750 --> 01:53:29,750
Moreover,
shells were terrifying because as 

1819
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:29,750
lieutenants,
st lagers,

1820
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:33,530
somewhat coyly observed,
they could make such a mess of one and 

1821
01:53:33,530 --> 01:53:35,310
quote,
Watson continues quote,

1822
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:37,740
the weapon eviscerated,
maimed,

1823
01:53:37,741 --> 01:53:42,741
and disfigured body parts could be 
scattered over wide distances and legs 

1824
01:53:42,741 --> 01:53:45,480
and arms blown into trees by the force 
of explosions.

1825
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:48,390
Such sites were obviously extremely 
disturbing,

1826
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:51,150
especially when the victims were friends
or comrades.

1827
01:53:51,390 --> 01:53:55,320
As lieutenant boxall remarked quote,
when you have seen a shell fall into the

1828
01:53:55,321 --> 01:53:59,010
midst of six men and packed three of 
them away in a sandbag,

1829
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:02,370
one wonders whether anything matters and
to quote

1830
01:54:04,730 --> 01:54:09,410
this is when you realize though that 
these people are veterans in this combat

1831
01:54:09,411 --> 01:54:14,411
and that this makes a huge difference.
These people have been hardened to their

1832
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:19,541
current state by degrees,
by seeing many horrible things in the 

1833
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:25,720
past and living through situations that 
while they might not be as extreme as 

1834
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:28,910
what they're about to go through,
our smaller versions on the way there,

1835
01:54:28,911 --> 01:54:33,911
it's like lifting a smaller amount of 
weight on your way up to lifting a 

1836
01:54:33,911 --> 01:54:37,361
greater amount of weight.
It's not like taking a week civilian 

1837
01:54:37,361 --> 01:54:40,871
like yours truly and throwing him into 
the Kaiser sherlocked tomorrow and then 

1838
01:54:40,871 --> 01:54:43,010
expecting him to endure under shell 
fire.

1839
01:54:44,070 --> 01:54:47,700
And while there are certainly people 
that fell apart under shell fire,

1840
01:54:47,701 --> 01:54:50,160
broken,
ran under shall fire lost their minds.

1841
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:51,510
You know,
to shell shock.

1842
01:54:51,511 --> 01:54:54,060
I mean a lot of those kinds of things.
The the amazing story here,

1843
01:54:54,061 --> 01:54:59,061
and I think this is what has amazed 
people throughout history since it 

1844
01:54:59,061 --> 01:54:59,061
happened,
is that the vast,

1845
01:54:59,061 --> 01:55:04,041
vast,
vast majority of people stayed there in 

1846
01:55:04,041 --> 01:55:07,161
those positions and took it.
Having the logical part of their brain 

1847
01:55:08,770 --> 01:55:13,770
and self control somehow overriding 
their animal instincts that must have 

1848
01:55:13,770 --> 01:55:15,160
been screaming at them to simply flea.

1849
01:55:16,990 --> 01:55:21,990
But as I said,
these people had been hardened by what 

1850
01:55:21,990 --> 01:55:24,200
they'd seen before.
You know,

1851
01:55:24,201 --> 01:55:26,330
the very day before March,
20,

1852
01:55:26,331 --> 01:55:28,520
first before this artillery barrage 
happens.

1853
01:55:28,850 --> 01:55:33,850
Ernst Junger is in a shell hole in a 
relatively safe part of the line.

1854
01:55:36,710 --> 01:55:41,710
He and an officer are in one and a whole
bunch of manner in the big shell hole 

1855
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:43,470
next to his.
It's like an amphitheater he says,

1856
01:55:43,740 --> 01:55:43,980
and they're

1857
01:55:43,980 --> 01:55:46,650
sort of having a meeting.
Everybody's stack their weapons and it's

1858
01:55:46,651 --> 01:55:51,651
calm and they're shell fire going on and
then all of a sudden sort of a random 

1859
01:55:51,651 --> 01:55:55,251
stray shell falls into that big crater 
that's built like an amphitheater that 

1860
01:55:55,251 --> 01:56:00,021
had 100 men in it.
It's maybe the most gruesome upsetting 

1861
01:56:00,891 --> 01:56:04,100
part of youngers,
gruesome and upsetting story.

1862
01:56:04,101 --> 01:56:07,610
And he says after the explosion,
it's so freaked him out.

1863
01:56:07,611 --> 01:56:08,960
And this is Ernst Junger,
we don't.

1864
01:56:08,961 --> 01:56:10,640
One of the,
one of the Veterans Veterans,

1865
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:13,880
he goes tearing off running in a sort of
a panic before.

1866
01:56:13,881 --> 01:56:18,881
Eventually he'll stop himself and 
realizes he should go back and try to 

1867
01:56:18,881 --> 01:56:18,881
help some of those men.

1868
01:56:19,280 --> 01:56:21,980
But then that same orange junger,
you know,

1869
01:56:21,981 --> 01:56:23,540
that next morning,
whatever it is,

1870
01:56:23,541 --> 01:56:28,541
12,
15 hours afterwards is going to be 

1871
01:56:28,541 --> 01:56:29,360
sitting in his jumping off point,
synchronizing his watch,

1872
01:56:29,361 --> 01:56:32,570
watching this artillery drop on the 
British and getting ready to go over the

1873
01:56:32,571 --> 01:56:37,571
top and attack.
What's amazing is when he does so he 

1874
01:56:37,641 --> 01:56:42,641
does so in an almost giddy fashion.
It's hard to describe the,

1875
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:45,830
the mood that these soldiers going over 
the top,

1876
01:56:46,130 --> 01:56:47,660
you know,
suggest during this battle.

1877
01:56:47,661 --> 01:56:52,661
I mean,
ernst young or is not necessarily 

1878
01:56:52,661 --> 01:56:52,661
representative,
but he says everybody else,

1879
01:56:52,661 --> 01:56:54,020
we're sort of kind of on the edge of 
sanity,

1880
01:56:54,021 --> 01:56:59,021
almost busy work.
But at the same time he says that they 

1881
01:56:59,021 --> 01:57:02,561
would talk to each other and it would 
only come out in little fragments of 

1882
01:57:02,561 --> 01:57:02,561
sentences.
And he said,

1883
01:57:02,561 --> 01:57:04,760
anybody who was observing us would think
we were incredibly happy

1884
01:57:06,460 --> 01:57:11,460
and at the same time he's talking about 
this rage that's coming over him and he 

1885
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:14,621
squeezes his eyes and the tears are 
coming out and he's ready to hurt 

1886
01:57:14,621 --> 01:57:18,131
somebody.
And what's funny when you read it is it 

1887
01:57:18,141 --> 01:57:23,141
kind of reminds you something that may 
be in the back of your head you knew 

1888
01:57:23,141 --> 01:57:24,890
already.
But I think when we look at these modern

1889
01:57:24,891 --> 01:57:28,120
soldiers coming from Nice backgrounds 
like ourselves and you know,

1890
01:57:28,130 --> 01:57:30,800
well trained and educated and all these 
kinds of things,

1891
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:36,280
we somehow assume that the very 
tendencies that we will freely admit 

1892
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:41,021
that ancient peoples had and vikings hat
and all these kinds of peoples that 

1893
01:57:41,021 --> 01:57:41,960
could get up into a busy work rage,
you know,

1894
01:57:41,961 --> 01:57:46,961
and kill a victim and stand up and 
celebrate in it and enjoy being a 

1895
01:57:46,961 --> 01:57:50,531
warrior.
That somehow because we have aircraft 

1896
01:57:50,531 --> 01:57:52,250
and artillery machine guns and a nice.
I mean that it's all gone.

1897
01:57:53,830 --> 01:57:57,220
And in some people it is.
But in some people it's not.

1898
01:57:57,820 --> 01:58:02,820
And Ernst Junger goes looking for 
someone to kill when he jumps out of 

1899
01:58:02,820 --> 01:58:07,051
these.
Jumping off points after the artillery 

1900
01:58:07,051 --> 01:58:07,690
barrage lifts in the German Army,
attacks on March 21st,

1901
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:13,320
the big sweep at Operation Michael.
It's foggy by the way.

1902
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:19,020
This will be one of the things that Luke
Dorf will get lucky with a couple of 

1903
01:58:19,020 --> 01:58:21,991
times in his multi punch combination.
Fog is not great for the German 

1904
01:58:21,991 --> 01:58:22,450
attackers.
It makes it difficult,

1905
01:58:22,690 --> 01:58:26,620
but it's a nightmare for the defenders.
The Germans are using what are sometimes

1906
01:58:26,621 --> 01:58:31,621
called infiltration tactics and if it's 
foggy infiltration tactics are a lot 

1907
01:58:31,621 --> 01:58:34,150
more effective.
The British have setup all these defense

1908
01:58:34,151 --> 01:58:39,151
zones with crossing machine,
gun fire and all these things were all 

1909
01:58:39,151 --> 01:58:39,250
these,
all these different defense readouts can

1910
01:58:39,251 --> 01:58:44,251
help each other,
but because of the they can't see 

1911
01:58:44,251 --> 01:58:46,741
anything and then all of a sudden the 
Germans are jumping into the trenches 

1912
01:58:49,291 --> 01:58:53,160
where the British soldiers are.
You catching them totally off guard

1913
01:58:54,620 --> 01:58:57,620
historian Peter Harte quotes Captain 
Charles Miller,

1914
01:58:57,621 --> 01:59:00,740
who was on the line as the German's 
approach for their initial attack.

1915
01:59:00,741 --> 01:59:02,450
You know,
before 9:00

1916
01:59:02,450 --> 01:59:05,060
AM on the morning of the 21st through 
the fog and says quote.

1917
01:59:05,510 --> 01:59:09,110
The first attackers were into the trench
long before the [inaudible] lifted.

1918
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:12,590
I was so occupied with the flanks that I
barely saw them before.

1919
01:59:12,591 --> 01:59:16,310
They appeared out of the mist and leapt 
down into the trench in a moment.

1920
01:59:16,311 --> 01:59:18,560
We were all mixed up in hand to hand 
fighting.

1921
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:21,260
I had two men coming at me with their 
bayonets,

1922
01:59:21,440 --> 01:59:26,440
one of whom I think I shot with my 
revolver while a sergeant standing just 

1923
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:28,580
behind me,
shot the other at point blank range with

1924
01:59:28,581 --> 01:59:31,940
his rifle barrel over my shoulder,
but almost at the same second,

1925
01:59:32,090 --> 01:59:37,090
a German stick bomb came whistling into 
the trench from the parapet right into 

1926
01:59:37,090 --> 01:59:39,710
the bunch of us and killed or wounded 
practically the whole lot of us,

1927
01:59:39,890 --> 01:59:44,890
English and German alike.
Whether it was actually this bomb or a 

1928
01:59:44,890 --> 01:59:45,920
bayonet stabbed that gave me the wound 
in my neck.

1929
01:59:45,921 --> 01:59:47,720
I don't know.
It might've been either

1930
01:59:48,210 --> 01:59:49,620
for a moment.
We were clear,

1931
01:59:49,800 --> 01:59:52,170
but there was a nasty little shambles 
around us.

1932
01:59:52,350 --> 01:59:54,900
Sergeant Ad Cock,
who had just saved my life.

1933
01:59:55,050 --> 02:00:00,050
Having his head blown off,
I felt awfully weak and discovered that 

1934
02:00:00,050 --> 02:00:00,870
a river of blood was flowing from my 
neck.

1935
02:00:01,110 --> 02:00:06,110
I tried to bandage it,
but the bandage wouldn't hold before 

1936
02:00:06,110 --> 02:00:09,501
they attacked us again.
They brought up some trench mortars and 

1937
02:00:09,501 --> 02:00:10,920
knocked seven bells out of us than 
swarmed into the trench.

1938
02:00:11,190 --> 02:00:16,190
By that time,
there were only a handful of us left on 

1939
02:00:16,190 --> 02:00:18,321
our feet and all I suppose wounded.
I got another wound from a stick bomb 

1940
02:00:18,321 --> 02:00:20,760
which put a bit of metal into my thigh 
before I collapsed.

1941
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:26,000
I tried to give the surrender signal and
hoped I succeeded thereby in saving a 

1942
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:29,000
few lives.
We had done our best and to quote,

1943
02:00:30,340 --> 02:00:35,050
and one of the things that happens with 
these modern battles is that they really

1944
02:00:35,051 --> 02:00:40,051
turn into hundreds of smaller encounters
that when you add them up together equal

1945
02:00:40,461 --> 02:00:45,461
this big thing going on over 40 miles.
But when you read the accounts of these 

1946
02:00:45,461 --> 02:00:45,520
battles,
they all sound like,

1947
02:00:45,790 --> 02:00:50,790
you know,
me and 10 guys took that machine gun 

1948
02:00:50,790 --> 02:00:54,120
nest 100 yards away and it took us three
hours and we lost two men and we killed 

1949
02:00:54,120 --> 02:00:55,060
everybody in the machine gun nest.
And then we continued to move on.

1950
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:57,340
That's an encounter in this war,
right?

1951
02:00:57,670 --> 02:01:02,670
So every time you read one,
it sounds like an isolated little 

1952
02:01:02,670 --> 02:01:02,670
incident.
In fact,

1953
02:01:02,670 --> 02:01:05,140
younger when he comes upon the first 
enemy soldier,

1954
02:01:05,141 --> 02:01:09,670
he sees on March 21st it's this private 
encounter,

1955
02:01:09,671 --> 02:01:14,671
this moment where youngers in this 
almost buzzard mood that he just talked 

1956
02:01:14,771 --> 02:01:15,550
about,
Giddy,

1957
02:01:15,551 --> 02:01:18,880
they'd been drinking alcohol there,
punch drunk from all the artillery.

1958
02:01:18,881 --> 02:01:21,610
I mean,
it's just a sensory overload and he sees

1959
02:01:21,611 --> 02:01:23,980
this enemy and he says,
quote.

1960
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:28,780
Then I saw my first enemy,
a figure in Brown,

1961
02:01:28,781 --> 02:01:32,830
uniform wounded,
apparently crouched 20 paces away in the

1962
02:01:32,831 --> 02:01:36,100
middle of the battered path with his 
hands propped on the ground.

1963
02:01:36,430 --> 02:01:38,950
I turned a corner and we caught sight of
each other.

1964
02:01:39,170 --> 02:01:40,070
I saw him jump

1965
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:43,520
as I approached and stare at me with 
gaping eyes while I,

1966
02:01:43,521 --> 02:01:47,600
with my face behind my pistol,
stocked up to him slowly and coldly.

1967
02:01:47,930 --> 02:01:51,020
A bloody scene with no witnesses was 
about to happen.

1968
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:54,650
It was a relief to me.
Finally to have the photo in front of me

1969
02:01:54,651 --> 02:01:59,651
and within reach,
I set the mouth of the pistol at the 

1970
02:01:59,651 --> 02:02:02,471
man's temple.
He was too frightened to move while my 

1971
02:02:02,471 --> 02:02:05,741
other fist grabbed hold of his tunic,
feeling metals and badges of rank and 

1972
02:02:05,741 --> 02:02:10,181
officer.
He must have held some command post in 

1973
02:02:10,181 --> 02:02:10,250
these trenches with the plaintiff's 
sound.

1974
02:02:10,370 --> 02:02:13,310
He reached into his pocket not to pull 
out a weapon,

1975
02:02:13,580 --> 02:02:16,880
but a photograph which he held up to me.
I saw him on it,

1976
02:02:17,180 --> 02:02:20,660
surrounded by numerous family all 
standing on a terrorist.

1977
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:24,170
It was a plea from another world.
Later,

1978
02:02:24,171 --> 02:02:27,350
I thought it was blind chance that I let
him go and plunged onward.

1979
02:02:27,680 --> 02:02:30,650
That one man of all often appeared in my
dreams.

1980
02:02:30,950 --> 02:02:34,760
I hope that meant he got to see his 
homeland again and to quote

1981
02:02:36,580 --> 02:02:41,580
so even in the blind rage of the 
busywork moment that younger had 

1982
02:02:43,001 --> 02:02:48,001
described earlier,
he was able to pull himself from the 

1983
02:02:48,001 --> 02:02:50,770
brink and answer that plea from another 
world and let that soldier live.

1984
02:02:51,850 --> 02:02:55,180
Mercy could be a dangerous commodity on 
a battlefield like this.

1985
02:02:56,120 --> 02:03:01,120
It was very normal for soldiers going 
past something like a bunker that might 

1986
02:03:01,120 --> 02:03:05,701
have enemy troops in it to just simply 
throw grenades down the stairs into the 

1987
02:03:05,701 --> 02:03:07,180
bunker and not worry about it.
And just keep on moving.

1988
02:03:07,930 --> 02:03:12,930
There were also a killings in hot blood 
a lot of the time it was normal.

1989
02:03:14,171 --> 02:03:17,200
For example,
if troops kept firing at you all the way

1990
02:03:17,201 --> 02:03:20,140
up until you were almost on top of them 
and then tried to surrender,

1991
02:03:20,141 --> 02:03:25,141
good luck with that.
There was killing in cold blood too on 

1992
02:03:25,141 --> 02:03:28,261
all sides,
but by and large when they could both 

1993
02:03:28,261 --> 02:03:32,371
sides like to take prisoners.
None of these armies surrendered in 

1994
02:03:32,371 --> 02:03:36,751
large numbers though was quite unusual,
but a mark of what a great first day 

1995
02:03:36,971 --> 02:03:41,971
operation Michael has is that it sees a 
huge amount of British troops 

1996
02:03:41,971 --> 02:03:43,960
surrendering in numbers that you never 
see.

1997
02:03:43,990 --> 02:03:48,520
Twenty 1000 of them on the first day.
17,000

1998
02:03:48,521 --> 02:03:53,521
of these people had been casualties due 
to that for our initial bombardment so 

1999
02:03:54,551 --> 02:03:57,550
you can see how their nerves are shot in
some cases

2000
02:03:59,100 --> 02:04:04,100
that they are infected by all those 
physical symptoms that we called it 

2001
02:04:04,100 --> 02:04:07,791
earlier and that they're just stunned.
Historian John Keegan tells a story of a

2002
02:04:10,211 --> 02:04:13,780
British machine gunner who must've been 
pretty representative of this day,

2003
02:04:13,781 --> 02:04:18,781
who is mowing down German soldiers like 
Ernst Junger as they approach his 

2004
02:04:18,781 --> 02:04:23,101
machine gun position and Keegan quotes 
the soldier as saying quote.

2005
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:27,820
I thought we'd stopped them when I felt 
a bump in the back.

2006
02:04:28,090 --> 02:04:32,140
I turned around and there was a German 
officer with a revolver in my back.

2007
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:33,700
Come along,
Tommy,

2008
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:36,640
you've done enough.
I turned round and then said,

2009
02:04:36,900 --> 02:04:38,220
thank you very much,
sir.

2010
02:04:38,580 --> 02:04:42,450
I know what I would've done if I had 
been held up by a machine gunner and had

2011
02:04:42,451 --> 02:04:45,270
that revolver in my hand.
I had a finished him off.

2012
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:48,810
He must have been a real gentleman.
It was 20 past 10.

2013
02:04:48,990 --> 02:04:53,990
I know to the minute because I looked at
my watch end quote and if you actually 

2014
02:04:55,231 --> 02:05:00,231
had to surrender to Germans,
you know while this offensive was going 

2015
02:05:00,231 --> 02:05:01,050
on,
it could be a very near run thing.

2016
02:05:02,620 --> 02:05:06,220
British private Alfred Gross is captured
on the 22nd of March,

2017
02:05:06,221 --> 02:05:09,880
so the next day with a boy as he 
described him,

2018
02:05:09,881 --> 02:05:14,881
but a soldier nonetheless who's badly 
hit in the head and he's bleeding and 

2019
02:05:14,921 --> 02:05:19,921
gross writes,
quote the area we cross swept by rifle 

2020
02:05:19,921 --> 02:05:21,820
and machine gun fire.
We crawl an escape it.

2021
02:05:22,030 --> 02:05:25,480
The boy is in pain and crying presently.
He jumps up.

2022
02:05:25,690 --> 02:05:27,190
Here they come,
he cries.

2023
02:05:27,250 --> 02:05:28,750
I pull him down.
Who?

2024
02:05:28,810 --> 02:05:30,790
I asked Jerry,
he said,

2025
02:05:31,030 --> 02:05:33,610
I look cautiously up there.
He is right enough.

2026
02:05:33,611 --> 02:05:38,290
The first wave almost on top of us,
and quote grouches account continues.

2027
02:05:38,730 --> 02:05:40,480
Quote,
leave it to me.

2028
02:05:40,481 --> 02:05:41,650
Boy,
we're done.

2029
02:05:41,710 --> 02:05:44,170
We're prisoners now.
Do whatever I tell you.

2030
02:05:44,350 --> 02:05:48,370
I wait a second and then up I say,
and take your helmet off.

2031
02:05:48,640 --> 02:05:51,160
We do.
So the German in front of me says,

2032
02:05:51,310 --> 02:05:54,010
ah,
raises his rifle and takes aim.

2033
02:05:54,220 --> 02:05:57,400
I muttered to myself.
I hope to God he won't pull that trigger

2034
02:05:57,700 --> 02:05:59,210
for 10 seconds.
We remain.

2035
02:05:59,211 --> 02:06:03,730
So then he lowers his rifle and says 
what I take to be wounded.

2036
02:06:04,210 --> 02:06:05,530
I nod and say,
yes,

2037
02:06:05,531 --> 02:06:07,750
yes.
He beckons and we approach.

2038
02:06:07,870 --> 02:06:10,210
We still have our equipment.
Dawn and the Germans,

2039
02:06:10,211 --> 02:06:12,490
other shouts pointing to it,
slip it off.

2040
02:06:12,520 --> 02:06:16,090
I cried at the boy doing it myself.
The German has spared us.

2041
02:06:16,270 --> 02:06:19,570
Would we have spared him under the 
circumstances God knows,

2042
02:06:19,750 --> 02:06:21,550
perhaps not and to quote,

2043
02:06:23,250 --> 02:06:27,180
but that same sort of gallantry you see 
on the German side in cases like this is

2044
02:06:27,181 --> 02:06:30,870
present on the French side and the 
British side and the Russian side.

2045
02:06:30,871 --> 02:06:35,871
I mean this is.
This is a human element coming forth in 

2046
02:06:35,871 --> 02:06:38,901
the midst of all this evil and of course
just as something to juxtaposition the 

2047
02:06:38,901 --> 02:06:42,921
whole thing.
You see the killing of prisoners by all 

2048
02:06:42,921 --> 02:06:46,791
sides as well.
Ian Passingham calls March 21st the day 

2049
02:06:47,910 --> 02:06:52,910
of the opening of the Michael Offensive,
the first punch in the multi punch 

2050
02:06:52,910 --> 02:06:52,910
combination,
right?

2051
02:06:52,910 --> 02:06:57,261
That the Germans are going to throw one 
of the most dramatic days of the whole 

2052
02:06:57,261 --> 02:07:00,291
war and he says,
quote in the event,

2053
02:07:00,721 --> 02:07:05,721
and despite numerous tales of heroic 
last stands and daring do the 21st of 

2054
02:07:05,721 --> 02:07:08,160
March was a disastrous day for Hague's.
B,

2055
02:07:08,161 --> 02:07:09,990
e,
f meaning the British forces.

2056
02:07:10,260 --> 02:07:12,780
It was the bloodiest day of the first 
world war.

2057
02:07:12,990 --> 02:07:15,870
There were over 78,000
casualties,

2058
02:07:16,020 --> 02:07:19,710
almost 40,000
on each side though the storm troops had

2059
02:07:19,711 --> 02:07:24,711
advanced in one or two places up to 10 
miles by the end of the day in the 

2060
02:07:24,711 --> 02:07:25,200
south.
Overall 20,

2061
02:07:25,201 --> 02:07:30,201
first of March was a day of great 
sacrifice and confusion and quote 78,000

2062
02:07:32,241 --> 02:07:36,040
casualties in one day.
That's your new world's record

2063
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:39,490
right there.
The horrible battle of Waterloo,

2064
02:07:39,530 --> 02:07:43,840
100 years previously had seen maybe 
60,000

2065
02:07:43,841 --> 02:07:48,841
casualties on the first day,
but there was no second day at the 

2066
02:07:48,841 --> 02:07:53,080
battle of Waterloo operation.
Michael led to 78,000

2067
02:07:53,081 --> 02:07:58,081
casualties on the first day of the first
punch of a multi punch combination that 

2068
02:07:58,081 --> 02:08:01,400
would go on for months.
Randall Gray,

2069
02:08:01,430 --> 02:08:06,430
who wrote a piece on the Kaiser Slot 
said it was quote the greatest and most 

2070
02:08:06,430 --> 02:08:10,250
intense battle ever fought by the 
British army and quote.

2071
02:08:11,210 --> 02:08:12,380
He also said,
quote,

2072
02:08:12,770 --> 02:08:16,280
it certainly represented the most awful 
non-nuclear,

2073
02:08:16,340 --> 02:08:21,340
but chemical fighting or deal undergone 
by 20th century soldiers with the 

2074
02:08:21,441 --> 02:08:26,441
possible exception of some 1941,
1945 eastern front battles and the Iran 

2075
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:32,350
Iraq war and the quote.
I always try to remind myself that what 

2076
02:08:34,461 --> 02:08:37,220
these soldiers went through with these 
battles,

2077
02:08:37,970 --> 02:08:42,240
scarred them forever and and and you 
know there's a difference.

2078
02:08:42,241 --> 02:08:44,430
We should understand that.
That there are a lot of people who go to

2079
02:08:44,431 --> 02:08:46,140
war who never see any combat,
who,

2080
02:08:46,410 --> 02:08:50,190
who deal with paperwork or logistics or 
supply and they're all very important,

2081
02:08:50,191 --> 02:08:55,191
but the people who come home after this 
war and change the psyche of the world,

2082
02:08:56,881 --> 02:08:58,260
the writers,
the thinkers,

2083
02:08:58,590 --> 02:09:03,590
just just the everyday people whose 
attitudes have been shocked into a 

2084
02:09:03,590 --> 02:09:07,341
different paradigm by what the 
experience in this combat go through 

2085
02:09:07,341 --> 02:09:08,940
things that have to haunt them.

2086
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:12,950
I was particularly moved in one of these
kaiser shocked battles.

2087
02:09:12,951 --> 02:09:17,951
A German soldier under artillery barrage
talks about what happened to him and 

2088
02:09:18,471 --> 02:09:23,471
when you think about him having to live 
with this memory the rest of his life 

2089
02:09:23,471 --> 02:09:23,690
and how it altered him on a personal 
level,

2090
02:09:23,870 --> 02:09:28,870
and then imagine millions of people who 
had seen equally scarring events in 

2091
02:09:29,121 --> 02:09:32,150
their lives who went on to help create 
this postwar world.

2092
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:37,480
And you can see how this war dug deeply 
into the psyche of 20th century 

2093
02:09:37,480 --> 02:09:39,980
civilization and gouged out a permanent 
wound.

2094
02:09:41,660 --> 02:09:45,110
The soldiers under French artillery fire
in one of these battles.

2095
02:09:45,111 --> 02:09:45,950
And he writes,
quote,

2096
02:09:46,730 --> 02:09:49,580
French shells,
began to hit to the right and left of us

2097
02:09:49,790 --> 02:09:54,790
leaving human forms writhing in agony.
Our advanced came to a stop and after 

2098
02:09:54,831 --> 02:09:56,960
hesitating a few minutes,
we drew back.

2099
02:09:56,961 --> 02:10:01,961
While the artillery fire followed us,
ripping large gashes in our formation.

2100
02:10:02,270 --> 02:10:07,270
Soon the French drum firing Gulf dust.
The air was filled with gas and flying 

2101
02:10:07,270 --> 02:10:10,190
pieces of steel.
We automatically mounted the machine gun

2102
02:10:10,191 --> 02:10:12,200
for action.
And then like animals,

2103
02:10:12,201 --> 02:10:16,070
we burrowed into the earth as if trying 
to find protection deepen its bosom.

2104
02:10:16,370 --> 02:10:19,310
Something struck my back where I carried
my gas mask,

2105
02:10:19,311 --> 02:10:24,311
but I did not pay attention to it.
A steel splinter broke the handle of my 

2106
02:10:24,311 --> 02:10:26,630
spade and another knocked the remains 
out of my hand.

2107
02:10:26,870 --> 02:10:29,600
I kept digging with my bare hands,
ducking my head.

2108
02:10:29,601 --> 02:10:34,601
Every time a shell exploded nearby,
a boy to my side hit in the arm and 

2109
02:10:34,601 --> 02:10:35,450
cried out for help.

2110
02:10:35,660 --> 02:10:40,660
I crawled over to him,
rip the sleeves of his coat and shirt 

2111
02:10:40,660 --> 02:10:41,720
open and started to bind the bleeding 
part.

2112
02:10:41,990 --> 02:10:45,020
The gas was now so thick that I could 
hardly discern what I was doing.

2113
02:10:45,230 --> 02:10:47,930
My eyes began to water and I felt as if 
I would choke.

2114
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:51,710
I reached for my gas mask,
pulling it out of its container and then

2115
02:10:51,711 --> 02:10:54,410
notice to my horror that a splinter had 
gone through it,

2116
02:10:54,620 --> 02:10:58,790
leaving a large hole.
I had seen death thousands of times,

2117
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:02,540
stared it in the face,
but never experienced the fear I felt.

2118
02:11:02,541 --> 02:11:05,330
Then immediately I reverted to the 
primitive.

2119
02:11:05,540 --> 02:11:10,540
I felt like an animal cornered by 
hunters with the instinct of self 

2120
02:11:10,540 --> 02:11:12,330
preservation upper most.
My eyes fell on the boy who's armed.

2121
02:11:12,350 --> 02:11:15,860
I had bandaged.
Somehow he'd managed to put the gas mask

2122
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:20,920
on his face with his one good arm.
I leapt at him and in the next moment 

2123
02:11:20,920 --> 02:11:23,210
had ripped the gas masks from his face 
with a feeble gesture.

2124
02:11:23,211 --> 02:11:26,930
He tried to wrench it from my grasp.
Then fell back exhausted.

2125
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:32,140
The last thing I saw before putting on 
the mask where his pleading eyes and to 

2126
02:11:32,140 --> 02:11:32,140
quote

2127
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:35,400
that's related in Peter Hearts,
wonderful book,

2128
02:11:35,401 --> 02:11:40,401
the Great War.
He has such a way of finding those 

2129
02:11:40,401 --> 02:11:43,131
incidents that when you read about them,
they they boggle your mind and then you 

2130
02:11:43,131 --> 02:11:46,540
can go forget about them,
but imagine the guy who has to live with

2131
02:11:46,541 --> 02:11:51,540
that the rest of his life.
Those kinds of moments that the extremes

2132
02:11:51,541 --> 02:11:56,290
of human experience where these moral 
choices are thrust in your face like the

2133
02:11:56,290 --> 02:12:01,290
Ernst Young,
or do I shoot this guy before he shows 

2134
02:12:01,290 --> 02:12:03,201
me the picture of his family.
It's kind of what makes these wars 

2135
02:12:03,201 --> 02:12:06,741
fascinating is how do people behave when
they are under this kind of intense 

2136
02:12:08,251 --> 02:12:10,830
pressure and strange extreme 
circumstances.

2137
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:13,410
This is what's happening at the ground 
level.

2138
02:12:13,860 --> 02:12:18,860
At the big picture level.
This last card played by the Germans 

2139
02:12:18,860 --> 02:12:23,661
here has been shockingly effective.
The British fifth army,

2140
02:12:24,031 --> 02:12:29,031
which let's be honest,
was in no position to be taking on a 

2141
02:12:29,031 --> 02:12:30,900
German force like this at the moment.
They had been recovering from a previous

2142
02:12:30,901 --> 02:12:35,901
battle.
They were holding too large a part of 

2143
02:12:35,901 --> 02:12:37,851
the front.
They had infrastructure and defenses 

2144
02:12:37,851 --> 02:12:39,960
that needed some work and then they get 
hit with this force in this,

2145
02:12:39,990 --> 02:12:44,990
in this violence,
and it immediately shoves them 

2146
02:12:44,990 --> 02:12:44,990
backwards.

2147
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:49,600
The Germans penetrate the first line of 
their defenses in an hour or two.

2148
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:52,360
They're into the second line of their 
defenses by lunchtime.

2149
02:12:52,810 --> 02:12:57,810
This causes the first of several of what
I call soil your underpants moments that

2150
02:13:00,251 --> 02:13:05,251
are part of the Kaiser Schlock,
the multi punch combination of Luton 

2151
02:13:05,251 --> 02:13:10,021
doors.
By the second day of the battle 

2152
02:13:10,210 --> 02:13:13,840
historian hold your irving says that the
fighting is intense.

2153
02:13:13,841 --> 02:13:17,860
It's hand to hand,
it's it's close combat with grenades and

2154
02:13:17,861 --> 02:13:18,850
it's,
it's brutal,

2155
02:13:19,450 --> 02:13:21,010
and he writes,
quote,

2156
02:13:21,790 --> 02:13:26,790
after two days,
ludendorff mobile and attack divisions 

2157
02:13:26,790 --> 02:13:30,540
had decimated golf's fifth army and 
driven the British almost 40 miles 

2158
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:32,430
behind the song and the croisette canal.

2159
02:13:32,610 --> 02:13:35,580
Haig had lost 200,000
killed and wounded,

2160
02:13:35,790 --> 02:13:39,510
90,000
prisoners of war and 1300 guns.

2161
02:13:39,750 --> 02:13:42,570
Most importantly,
his defenses had been ruptured.

2162
02:13:42,750 --> 02:13:46,590
A 50 mile gap driven through his lines.
Open field,

2163
02:13:46,680 --> 02:13:51,680
lay ahead of the Germans and quote,
this initial advance has morale 

2164
02:13:53,521 --> 02:13:58,521
skyrocketing amongst the Kaiser and some
around him pulled your says,

2165
02:13:59,011 --> 02:13:59,400
quote

2166
02:14:00,550 --> 02:14:01,900
wilhelm.
The second rushed,

2167
02:14:01,901 --> 02:14:05,830
congratulations to the troops and 
admonish them to push on.

2168
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:08,030
This is the kaiser talking.
Now quote,

2169
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:10,540
much has been accomplished,
much more.

2170
02:14:10,541 --> 02:14:14,830
Still remains to be conquered and quote 
her vague continues.

2171
02:14:14,831 --> 02:14:19,831
Quote,
the Kaiser ordered schools closed in 

2172
02:14:19,831 --> 02:14:22,531
Germany to mark the victory in quotes.
He presented Hindenburg with the Iron 

2173
02:14:23,530 --> 02:14:28,530
Cross with golden rays last given to 
prince blue shirt for reducing pressure 

2174
02:14:28,530 --> 02:14:32,731
of Napoleon and wilhelm.
The second informed his entourage over 

2175
02:14:32,731 --> 02:14:33,120
champagne.
That quote,

2176
02:14:33,460 --> 02:14:36,250
if an English delegation came to sue for
peace,

2177
02:14:36,370 --> 02:14:41,370
it must kneel before the German standard
for it was a question here of a victory 

2178
02:14:41,370 --> 02:14:45,781
of the monarchy over democracy and quote
glutened door for sure at his kaiser 

2179
02:14:46,151 --> 02:14:49,060
that the British army had been defeated 
and the quote,

2180
02:14:50,870 --> 02:14:55,870
but many in the upper echelons of 
Germany's military were much more sober 

2181
02:14:55,870 --> 02:15:00,701
about what was happening here and 
realize that at the pace they were 

2182
02:15:00,701 --> 02:15:02,090
getting chewed up,
it was going to be a problem.

2183
02:15:02,850 --> 02:15:06,060
The question is,
who was going to break first?

2184
02:15:06,420 --> 02:15:11,420
This is like this boxing match,
which we've compared this entire war to 

2185
02:15:11,420 --> 02:15:15,861
throughout this entire series.
We have two exhausted fighters here in 

2186
02:15:15,861 --> 02:15:15,861
the German high command is kind of 
thinking,

2187
02:15:15,861 --> 02:15:20,690
you know,
we really don't have that much left and 

2188
02:15:20,690 --> 02:15:20,690
then some of the German high command or 
countering with.

2189
02:15:20,690 --> 02:15:21,870
Yeah,
but neither do they.

2190
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:28,340
The fifth army will be forced to pull 
back when they pull back.

2191
02:15:28,341 --> 02:15:30,920
The army next to them has to pull back 
the third army.

2192
02:15:30,921 --> 02:15:32,900
Otherwise they'll lose contact with each
other.

2193
02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:39,290
The problem is is that both these armies
are attached to a French army and this 

2194
02:15:39,361 --> 02:15:44,361
is the first crisis that erupts.
There's a breach about to open up 

2195
02:15:45,121 --> 02:15:46,740
between the British and the French 
armies.

2196
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:51,860
Splitting those armies would be huge.
This brings us to what the heck is Luke 

2197
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:54,750
Dorf trying to do?
Right?

2198
02:15:54,751 --> 02:15:57,000
What's his plan here in this?
Kaiser sherlocked?

2199
02:15:57,390 --> 02:15:59,970
Well,
it's one of the big controversies of the

2200
02:15:59,971 --> 02:16:04,971
war.
Theoretically he wants to punch a hole 

2201
02:16:04,971 --> 02:16:05,520
in the line,
surround the British,

2202
02:16:05,640 --> 02:16:10,640
push the British up like a bunch of 
falling dominoes all the way back up to 

2203
02:16:10,640 --> 02:16:14,241
the English Channel,
thereby changing the entire complexion 

2204
02:16:14,241 --> 02:16:15,530
of the war,
but he's flexible.

2205
02:16:16,990 --> 02:16:20,200
He has this saying that has often been 
quoted afterwards because this is one of

2206
02:16:20,201 --> 02:16:25,201
the things ludendorff gets the most 
critiqued about where he says in terms 

2207
02:16:25,201 --> 02:16:28,090
of the strategy and tactics for this big
multi punch combination quote,

2208
02:16:28,420 --> 02:16:30,010
we will punch hole and

2209
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:35,010
then we will see.
We did it that way in Russia and the 

2210
02:16:35,010 --> 02:16:38,431
court and he and Hindenburg did kind of 
do that when they were commanding the 

2211
02:16:38,431 --> 02:16:38,830
eastern front.
They go in there,

2212
02:16:38,831 --> 02:16:40,910
they'd punch a hole,
they'd roll up a Russian army,

2213
02:16:40,911 --> 02:16:45,911
do a bazillion casualties,
and you do that long enough and 

2214
02:16:45,911 --> 02:16:47,140
eventually a rickety Russian state falls
apart.

2215
02:16:47,141 --> 02:16:52,141
But this is France and Britain.
Are you really sort of gambling that 

2216
02:16:52,141 --> 02:16:53,920
you're going to open up this whole and 
they're just going to fall apart?

2217
02:16:54,730 --> 02:16:59,730
Well alluded doors.
Attitude is that I'm not going to fall 

2218
02:16:59,730 --> 02:17:03,091
for the mistakes of my predecessors.
Those people who you know have this one 

2219
02:17:03,091 --> 02:17:06,721
place they want to attack and they run 
into a brick wall and they just keep 

2220
02:17:06,721 --> 02:17:06,940
throwing more troops into the meat 
grinder in front of that brick wall.

2221
02:17:06,941 --> 02:17:09,100
We're not going to do that when we break
through somewhere.

2222
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:14,160
We're going to reinforce success and 
this is supposed to be part of the 

2223
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:17,821
latest German ideas about the war,
but what happens if the breakthrough 

2224
02:17:17,821 --> 02:17:19,600
comes at a spot where there's not that 
much of war,

2225
02:17:19,601 --> 02:17:21,950
winning quality,
you know,

2226
02:17:21,951 --> 02:17:26,951
goals anywhere nearby because the bulge,
some even call it a breakthrough that 

2227
02:17:28,331 --> 02:17:33,331
the Germans have against the British.
Fifth Army happens at a place where 

2228
02:17:33,331 --> 02:17:35,680
there's not anything close by that's 
going to win you the war.

2229
02:17:36,520 --> 02:17:38,110
All those places had been,
you know,

2230
02:17:38,111 --> 02:17:41,740
extra specially defended by the best 
troops in the best defense is the reason

2231
02:17:41,741 --> 02:17:46,060
that the Germans breakthrough here is 
because there wasn't some very important

2232
02:17:46,061 --> 02:17:51,061
object nearby,
but the Germans are moving so far that 

2233
02:17:51,061 --> 02:17:54,991
eventually they run into one a place 
where the roads and railways all come 

2234
02:17:54,991 --> 02:17:55,510
together.
A French city name I'm.

2235
02:17:55,511 --> 02:18:00,511
Yeah,
and it's at this point that something 

2236
02:18:00,511 --> 02:18:03,500
that's been an issue for the entire war 
comes to a,

2237
02:18:04,030 --> 02:18:09,030
an almost fatal head,
and that is the fact that there is no 

2238
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:14,200
coordinated allied leadership at all 
because at this point,

2239
02:18:14,410 --> 02:18:19,410
Douglas Haig,
the British military commander on the 

2240
02:18:19,410 --> 02:18:19,410
scene would like help from the French.

2241
02:18:19,410 --> 02:18:23,610
In this crisis situation,
please send me troops and historians 

2242
02:18:23,610 --> 02:18:23,610
have argued about whether or not they 
did.

2243
02:18:23,610 --> 02:18:28,591
Some historians nowadays say they not 
only did they did it before they were 

2244
02:18:28,591 --> 02:18:29,110
even asked,
and they did it in larger numbers.

2245
02:18:29,870 --> 02:18:34,870
They were British historians that have 
always said the French were very stingy 

2246
02:18:34,870 --> 02:18:37,921
with extra troops and put Hagen,
a situation where the worst possible 

2247
02:18:37,921 --> 02:18:38,290
thing could happen.
I mean the soil,

2248
02:18:38,291 --> 02:18:43,291
your underpants moment indeed,
but Haig was asking for troops from a 

2249
02:18:43,721 --> 02:18:45,570
guy named Pataki who had his own 
worried.

2250
02:18:45,571 --> 02:18:50,571
He was worried he'd gotten an 
intelligence that the Germans had 

2251
02:18:50,571 --> 02:18:51,490
another fist that was poised to attack 
near Paris,

2252
02:18:51,491 --> 02:18:54,580
and as far as potassium was concerned,
that was his number one concern.

2253
02:18:55,780 --> 02:19:00,780
There's a meeting on March 26th and some
historians have described Hague's mood 

2254
02:19:00,941 --> 02:19:05,941
at this point as near panic as he runs 
up against this brick wall where he's 

2255
02:19:06,611 --> 02:19:11,611
not getting the kind of help he feels 
like he needs and he's in a crisis 

2256
02:19:11,611 --> 02:19:11,611
situation.

2257
02:19:11,611 --> 02:19:16,140
Eric Dorn grows,
says quote gaps also opened between the 

2258
02:19:16,150 --> 02:19:18,130
British and the French.
Across the EU is river sending.

2259
02:19:18,131 --> 02:19:22,300
Hey Gunton near panic as he ordered 
trenches dug to protect the channel.

2260
02:19:22,301 --> 02:19:25,330
Ports shifted six divisions from his 
northern armies,

2261
02:19:25,331 --> 02:19:30,200
including three from the front line and 
implored pitocin to rush 20 divisions.

2262
02:19:30,470 --> 02:19:32,390
Now he's quoting the head of the general
staff.

2263
02:19:32,391 --> 02:19:34,240
The British general staffs,
Sir Henry Wilson Quote,

2264
02:19:34,460 --> 02:19:38,010
Hague is cowed,
said Wilson on March 25th quote.

2265
02:19:38,210 --> 02:19:40,790
He said that unless the whole of the 
French army came up,

2266
02:19:40,940 --> 02:19:45,940
we were beaten and it would be better to
make peace on any terms we could and the

2267
02:19:47,270 --> 02:19:52,270
seriousness of this situation finally 
leads the allied Entente powers to 

2268
02:19:54,260 --> 02:19:59,260
disregard questions of sovereignty and 
jealous guarding of have rights and 

2269
02:19:59,260 --> 02:20:03,851
privileges and all that,
and finally decide to nominate and 

2270
02:20:03,851 --> 02:20:07,460
finally approved somebody whose job it's
going to be not so much to be the boss,

2271
02:20:07,461 --> 02:20:12,461
but to be the guy that coordinates,
and this honor goes to the French 

2272
02:20:12,461 --> 02:20:13,010
military leader,
Ferdinand Foshan.

2273
02:20:13,040 --> 02:20:16,340
We had talked about him in an earlier 
episode.

2274
02:20:16,430 --> 02:20:19,220
Very aggressive,
energetic,

2275
02:20:19,970 --> 02:20:24,970
brave.
I'm one of the first things he'll do is 

2276
02:20:24,970 --> 02:20:28,421
issue an order that says that there will
be no retreat from this important French

2277
02:20:29,180 --> 02:20:31,010
city that Ludendorff is going to go 
after.

2278
02:20:31,011 --> 02:20:32,600
Now I'm,
yeah,

2279
02:20:32,900 --> 02:20:37,900
that people have to die where they stand
basically not one step back and he will 

2280
02:20:38,271 --> 02:20:40,970
dole out the reinforcements as he sees 
fit,

2281
02:20:40,971 --> 02:20:45,971
but he's going to be very stingy and the
generals like Haig will think that he's 

2282
02:20:45,971 --> 02:20:47,840
stingy.
Lloyd George,

2283
02:20:47,841 --> 02:20:50,450
the British Prime Minister,
writes in his memoir as though that that

2284
02:20:50,451 --> 02:20:53,660
Fascia was being a gambler and that's 
what generals often have to be.

2285
02:20:53,661 --> 02:20:55,670
How often have we said that dwarfs 
gambler,

2286
02:20:55,970 --> 02:21:00,970
but would fatia is gambling on is that 
he can be stingy with these reserves and

2287
02:21:01,071 --> 02:21:06,071
that these generals can manage without 
them or manage without what they really 

2288
02:21:06,071 --> 02:21:06,071
want.

2289
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:08,720
I Mean Hague's upset.
He can't get 20 divisions.

2290
02:21:08,721 --> 02:21:12,320
20 divisions is a huge force.
No wonder you can't get 20 division.

2291
02:21:12,500 --> 02:21:17,500
Fatia is trying to safeguard and 
stockpile a reserve force.

2292
02:21:17,901 --> 02:21:20,720
People that could just stay back,
stay in good health,

2293
02:21:20,721 --> 02:21:22,340
ready to go,
chomping at the bit,

2294
02:21:22,610 --> 02:21:27,610
and then unleash a counter attack.
When the German offensive is like the 

2295
02:21:27,610 --> 02:21:31,631
wave that washes up on the beach and 
loses its momentum right before it sinks

2296
02:21:31,761 --> 02:21:34,030
back into the surf,
that's when you want to launch a counter

2297
02:21:34,031 --> 02:21:36,290
offensive with fresh troops.
When the enemy's exhausted,

2298
02:21:36,980 --> 02:21:41,980
what Foshe sees in this multiplex hunch 
combination of Luton do offices an 

2299
02:21:42,411 --> 02:21:47,411
opportunity to win the war.
Let the Germans punch themselves out 

2300
02:21:47,411 --> 02:21:48,830
here and then take it to them with a 
fresh force.

2301
02:21:48,831 --> 02:21:53,831
Once they're exhausted,
but that fresh force can only be built 

2302
02:21:53,831 --> 02:21:56,651
by being stingy with reserves when 
people like Hagar worried that he's 

2303
02:21:56,651 --> 02:21:59,711
about to be pushed into the sea and the 
French and the British were about to 

2304
02:21:59,711 --> 02:21:59,830
lose contact and the,
you know,

2305
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:01,430
middle,
middle part of this front,

2306
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:04,900
there is desperate,
you know,

2307
02:22:05,180 --> 02:22:05,870
heroic.

2308
02:22:06,020 --> 02:22:08,120
When you talk about some of the fighting
of this battle,

2309
02:22:08,180 --> 02:22:09,440
it's the Kinda thing where,
you know,

2310
02:22:09,441 --> 02:22:14,150
you have the last four guys with the gun
overrun fighting to the last man to give

2311
02:22:14,151 --> 02:22:15,380
the rest of the army,
you know,

2312
02:22:15,381 --> 02:22:17,420
another hour of safety while they,
you know,

2313
02:22:17,421 --> 02:22:20,120
move back to reserve positions.
I mean it's,

2314
02:22:20,121 --> 02:22:22,910
it's really frantic heroic stuff and the
Germans are striving.

2315
02:22:22,911 --> 02:22:27,390
They know this is the war winning or war
losing moment and they're giving it.

2316
02:22:27,391 --> 02:22:30,450
Their,
all in the casualties are outrageous.

2317
02:22:31,100 --> 02:22:36,100
A lot of people talk about this time 
period as the end of trench warfare in 

2318
02:22:36,100 --> 02:22:40,311
the beginning of open warfare again,
which hasn't existed on the western 

2319
02:22:40,311 --> 02:22:41,400
front since the war started.
I mean you had like six months of it and

2320
02:22:41,401 --> 02:22:46,401
the casualties were terrible.
And then everything went down 

2321
02:22:46,401 --> 02:22:49,970
underground and into the trenches 
because it was the only way to stay 

2322
02:22:49,970 --> 02:22:50,670
alive with all that lead flying up 
above,

2323
02:22:51,250 --> 02:22:52,290
you know,
ground level.

2324
02:22:52,680 --> 02:22:55,570
And now we've had reverted to open 
warfare again in the troop.

2325
02:22:55,571 --> 02:23:00,571
Seemed happy to be moving,
but this is also much more dangerous 

2326
02:23:00,571 --> 02:23:01,800
because those trenches,
we're there for a reason.

2327
02:23:01,801 --> 02:23:06,801
They protected you from the kinds of 
casualties that you're starting to see 

2328
02:23:06,801 --> 02:23:08,280
right here at Kaiser Schlock with the 
resumption of open warfare.

2329
02:23:08,281 --> 02:23:12,210
Again comes the kind of casualties that 
we hadn't seen for awhile.

2330
02:23:13,670 --> 02:23:17,320
Something happens on March 23rd that 
it's,

2331
02:23:17,370 --> 02:23:22,370
it's hard to put it in a proper context.
What happens is people in Paris start 

2332
02:23:23,601 --> 02:23:26,720
seeing and hearing explosions out of 
nowhere,

2333
02:23:27,320 --> 02:23:32,320
decent size explosions to and in an 
interesting sort of twist.

2334
02:23:33,330 --> 02:23:36,630
The explosion comes with no sound of any
shell or anything.

2335
02:23:36,631 --> 02:23:38,100
There's just nothing.
And then boom,

2336
02:23:38,420 --> 02:23:39,930
you know,
something goes up in smoke

2337
02:23:41,320 --> 02:23:46,320
and it's puzzling for awhile.
The people in Paris can't figure out 

2338
02:23:46,320 --> 02:23:46,320
what's going on.
And they were,

2339
02:23:46,320 --> 02:23:50,160
you know,
there are books that talk about this 

2340
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:51,451
where people will be in cafes,
speculating on what's causing the 

2341
02:23:51,451 --> 02:23:52,540
explosions and you know,
aircraft is what everybody was thinking,

2342
02:23:52,541 --> 02:23:54,910
but the skies were clear and there were 
no aircraft.

2343
02:23:55,450 --> 02:24:00,450
And then one of the theories floated by 
some of these people in cafes that were 

2344
02:24:00,450 --> 02:24:02,410
quoted was that the Germans had somehow 
smuggled in artillery piece,

2345
02:24:02,710 --> 02:24:07,710
you know,
secretly hiding it in some forest or 

2346
02:24:07,710 --> 02:24:09,811
something within range of Paris because 
he was so obviously an artillery piece 

2347
02:24:09,811 --> 02:24:10,210
or a bomb.
Finally,

2348
02:24:10,780 --> 02:24:15,780
what the French will figure out is that 
they are being shelled from a cannon 

2349
02:24:17,470 --> 02:24:22,470
firing from the German side of the line,
but the German side of the line is way 

2350
02:24:22,470 --> 02:24:26,230
farther than the range of any other gun 
that anyone's ever heard of.

2351
02:24:27,300 --> 02:24:31,070
It turns out that Paris is not being 
shelled by one gun,

2352
02:24:31,130 --> 02:24:36,130
but probably multiple guns,
but they're called the Paris gun and 

2353
02:24:36,130 --> 02:24:39,670
they're being shelled from a distance of
75 miles.

2354
02:24:40,390 --> 02:24:45,390
The gun can reportedly shoot 81 miles.
And to give you an idea of how long that

2355
02:24:45,581 --> 02:24:50,581
is,
one of the longer range guns you will 

2356
02:24:50,581 --> 02:24:52,660
ever run into,
or the 16 inch guns on the American Iowa

2357
02:24:52,661 --> 02:24:57,160
class battleships and they can shoot,
if I recall correctly,

2358
02:24:57,580 --> 02:25:02,580
between 25 and 30 miles.
So you're talking about a gun that 

2359
02:25:02,580 --> 02:25:07,051
shoots twice as far easily.
It's got a barrel that is a hundred feet

2360
02:25:08,470 --> 02:25:13,470
long.
They have to have a special crane like 

2361
02:25:13,470 --> 02:25:13,470
device that,
that,

2362
02:25:13,470 --> 02:25:17,200
that sits over the gun and holds the 
barrel up and keeps it from drooping.

2363
02:25:19,510 --> 02:25:24,510
The shell that it shoots,
I am told is the thing that humans ever 

2364
02:25:25,631 --> 02:25:30,631
launched into the stratosphere and the 
distances were so long that the gunners 

2365
02:25:31,681 --> 02:25:36,681
had to reportedly account for the 
rotation of the earth in their 

2366
02:25:36,681 --> 02:25:40,641
calculations.
But their calculations couldn't be that 

2367
02:25:40,641 --> 02:25:45,140
targeted.
I mean these people could only shoot it 

2368
02:25:45,140 --> 02:25:47,040
cities and that accounts for why the 
shell sort of landed randomly.

2369
02:25:47,670 --> 02:25:52,670
The worst occasion is a is a much talked
about still incident during a holiday 

2370
02:25:53,161 --> 02:25:58,161
when people were in church and one of 
these shells came crashing through the 

2371
02:25:58,161 --> 02:26:01,431
roof,
exploded in the church and killed like 

2372
02:26:01,431 --> 02:26:01,431
80 or 90 people.
It was awful,

2373
02:26:01,540 --> 02:26:06,540
but over the course of the conflict,
it would only dish out a little more 

2374
02:26:06,540 --> 02:26:08,890
than 800 casualties in less than 300 
deaths,

2375
02:26:08,891 --> 02:26:13,891
which you know isn't wonderful,
but if you have a giant artillery piece 

2376
02:26:13,891 --> 02:26:18,061
shelling your city,
I think you would assume worse after 

2377
02:26:18,061 --> 02:26:18,910
awhile,
but some historians say this is all part

2378
02:26:18,911 --> 02:26:23,260
of a of a concerted effort that what the
Germans are trying to do with their army

2379
02:26:23,261 --> 02:26:28,261
is shock the allies into a pro German 
piece and shelling parish as a way of of

2380
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:32,230
of working the other flank sort of on 
that.

2381
02:26:33,800 --> 02:26:37,250
I'm pushing you British armies back.
I'm shelling Paris and believe me,

2382
02:26:37,251 --> 02:26:40,340
it certainly makes clear to the French,
the stakes involved here.

2383
02:26:40,520 --> 02:26:42,530
The Germans are close enough to be 
shelling Paris.

2384
02:26:44,530 --> 02:26:49,530
Now.
The key to this battle is going to be 

2385
02:26:49,530 --> 02:26:51,130
how the generals utilize the reserves 
that they have.

2386
02:26:51,131 --> 02:26:52,360
Not to get too technical,
but,

2387
02:26:52,600 --> 02:26:57,600
but in this level of warfare,
when troops are fighting each other in 

2388
02:26:57,600 --> 02:27:00,451
modern combat,
they're wearing each other down and 

2389
02:27:00,451 --> 02:27:03,151
whittling away their strength and so 
generals have at their disposal troops 

2390
02:27:03,151 --> 02:27:07,831
that they're holding back and where they
decide to commit those troops as part of

2391
02:27:07,931 --> 02:27:12,931
the art of generalship.
It's part of what wins or loses battles 

2392
02:27:12,931 --> 02:27:13,600
and it's part of what the generals are 
so concerned about.

2393
02:27:13,601 --> 02:27:18,601
When they launched these offensives,
at least half the offensives half the 

2394
02:27:18,601 --> 02:27:21,781
punches we'll throw in Kaiser sherlocked
are nothing but efforts to divert 

2395
02:27:22,840 --> 02:27:25,630
reserves from where he really wants to 
punch,

2396
02:27:27,060 --> 02:27:28,740
but we're alluding to have decided to 
do,

2397
02:27:28,890 --> 02:27:30,120
is to throw,
you know,

2398
02:27:30,180 --> 02:27:32,940
some of these vital and limited 
reserves,

2399
02:27:32,941 --> 02:27:34,950
which are all these wonderful storm 
troopers.

2400
02:27:35,460 --> 02:27:36,790
These,
um,

2401
02:27:36,870 --> 02:27:38,700
Ernst Junger says they're all kind of 
young,

2402
02:27:38,701 --> 02:27:42,810
long haired sort of wild man as opposed 
to the sort of buzz cut Germans.

2403
02:27:43,080 --> 02:27:45,240
It's interesting to talk about storm 
troop culture.

2404
02:27:45,241 --> 02:27:49,350
I had understood them to be members of 
the of the best and brightest,

2405
02:27:49,351 --> 02:27:54,351
simply pulled out,
but younger makes him sound like some 

2406
02:27:54,351 --> 02:27:56,691
sort of ultra cool set of long haired 
German viking youngsters or something.

2407
02:27:58,440 --> 02:27:59,760
Nonetheless,
you don't have a ton of them,

2408
02:28:00,120 --> 02:28:01,410
so where are you going to use them?
Luton.

2409
02:28:01,411 --> 02:28:04,020
Dorf decides to throw them into where 
the British army,

2410
02:28:04,021 --> 02:28:09,021
the fifth army and the Third Army where 
they're bulging back like 40 miles and 

2411
02:28:09,021 --> 02:28:10,560
see if you can smash through to this 
important railway junction,

2412
02:28:11,780 --> 02:28:16,780
but he runs into the same problems that 
the British and the French could have 

2413
02:28:16,780 --> 02:28:21,011
warned him about that these first world 
war armies run into when they try to 

2414
02:28:21,261 --> 02:28:24,440
launch a fences and continue them day 
after day after day.

2415
02:28:24,890 --> 02:28:28,010
They simply break down and they break 
down on multiple levels.

2416
02:28:29,180 --> 02:28:34,180
First of all,
the logistical and supply problems are 

2417
02:28:34,180 --> 02:28:36,230
immense and their immense for the armies
that still have a lot of good stuff like

2418
02:28:36,231 --> 02:28:38,930
the British and the French to the 
Germans who were down to like,

2419
02:28:39,500 --> 02:28:44,500
you know,
horses that are underfed and not even 

2420
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:47,231
enough of them to try to move supply up.
These battles are huge challenges.

2421
02:28:48,410 --> 02:28:53,410
At one point,
some of these really important German 

2422
02:28:53,410 --> 02:28:55,661
armies and sort of ironic ended up 
conquering and pushing into the 

2423
02:28:55,661 --> 02:29:00,131
territory that they had deliberately 
destroyed in a scorched earth policy to 

2424
02:29:01,221 --> 02:29:04,880
hamper their opponents and now they had 
to try to operate in it.

2425
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:10,120
The German army right next door to the 
army that moved through the scorched 

2426
02:29:10,120 --> 02:29:12,881
earth territory,
ended up going through the old som 

2427
02:29:12,881 --> 02:29:13,420
battlefield with all its craters and 
barbed wire and you know,

2428
02:29:13,660 --> 02:29:15,980
the graveyards of the dead and all this.
I mean,

2429
02:29:16,220 --> 02:29:18,680
so both these armies were kind of in bad
terrain.

2430
02:29:18,681 --> 02:29:21,110
Now they're attacking and more and more,
you know,

2431
02:29:21,111 --> 02:29:26,111
the,
the allies are resisting heroically and 

2432
02:29:26,111 --> 02:29:29,441
the supply is huge.
The German army's starving in some cases

2433
02:29:31,750 --> 02:29:34,370
and you know when you read like the 
memoirs of Luton door feel,

2434
02:29:34,371 --> 02:29:35,580
say something like,
well supply.

2435
02:29:35,581 --> 02:29:39,710
I didn't keep up or some little comment 
like that as a reason why you know these

2436
02:29:39,711 --> 02:29:44,711
battles bogged down,
but when you actually read accounts of 

2437
02:29:44,711 --> 02:29:47,630
what these troops who are desperately 
trying to get the guns and the bullets,

2438
02:29:47,631 --> 02:29:52,120
but more importantly even the food to 
these people who are at what they called

2439
02:29:52,121 --> 02:29:54,500
the tip of the spear or the head of the 
snake.

2440
02:29:54,500 --> 02:29:59,500
The combat troops are actually fighting.
They're being shelled and shot at while 

2441
02:29:59,500 --> 02:30:03,410
they.
They try to overcome supply difficulties

2442
02:30:04,040 --> 02:30:05,870
that once you hear them,
you sit there and go,

2443
02:30:05,871 --> 02:30:06,740
why?
It's a miracle.

2444
02:30:06,741 --> 02:30:11,741
They got as far as they did.
Historian Alexander Watson has a 

2445
02:30:11,901 --> 02:30:16,901
reminiscence by one of these German 
supply troops who realizes that winning 

2446
02:30:18,171 --> 02:30:21,470
or losing the war requires that they get
their stuff up to the front,

2447
02:30:21,471 --> 02:30:26,471
but listen to what they have to contend 
with and then magnify this across an 

2448
02:30:27,081 --> 02:30:32,081
entire 40 or 50 mile front as they try 
to move forward and continue to keep 

2449
02:30:32,091 --> 02:30:36,080
this momentum.
As the supply lines get stretched longer

2450
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:39,380
and the German says,
quote,

2451
02:30:40,870 --> 02:30:43,510
I have the feeling that we've been 
marching in the wrong direction.

2452
02:30:43,780 --> 02:30:48,780
We asked on several occasions,
but don't receive any useful 

2453
02:30:48,780 --> 02:30:48,780
information,
and in the meantime,

2454
02:30:48,780 --> 02:30:53,581
Tommy,
their pet name for the British recall 

2455
02:30:53,581 --> 02:30:56,430
begins to shoot and not at all badly.
I thus right on ahead and come upon too 

2456
02:30:56,430 --> 02:31:00,220
recently shot up carts and two dead 
horses through a miracle.

2457
02:31:00,221 --> 02:31:05,221
The driver remains unhurt.
They warned us that we should not drive 

2458
02:31:05,221 --> 02:31:08,911
past for in front it's hell,
but what can you do therefore forwards?

2459
02:31:09,490 --> 02:31:10,300
Now,
however,

2460
02:31:10,301 --> 02:31:15,301
the way begins to get bad,
thick mud makes forward progress 

2461
02:31:15,301 --> 02:31:19,081
difficult.
And soon we have a supply column stuck 

2462
02:31:19,081 --> 02:31:21,811
fast in front of us.
A Saxon bridging unit cannot go any 

2463
02:31:21,811 --> 02:31:23,430
further.
It approaches us and gets stuck.

2464
02:31:23,670 --> 02:31:26,160
We therefore harness the horses,
push,

2465
02:31:26,310 --> 02:31:28,980
make room,
unload the bridging unit stuff,

2466
02:31:29,010 --> 02:31:31,770
et Cetera,
all in the deepest darkness and with the

2467
02:31:31,771 --> 02:31:33,120
least possible noise.

2468
02:31:33,420 --> 02:31:35,760
In addition,
the shells crash around,

2469
02:31:35,820 --> 02:31:39,120
but one no longer worries about them 
after much effort,

2470
02:31:39,121 --> 02:31:44,121
the wagons or got back on the road and 
we think now the comrade in his column 

2471
02:31:44,121 --> 02:31:48,650
who missed their way can go on,
but no just then a narrow gauge train 

2472
02:31:49,471 --> 02:31:54,471
comes rushing along.
Irresponsible chaps have thrown 

2473
02:31:54,471 --> 02:31:57,681
munitions on the rails.
One jolt and the train is derailed on 

2474
02:31:57,681 --> 02:32:01,911
exactly that street along which we have 
to pass what to do with unspeakable 

2475
02:32:02,371 --> 02:32:04,950
effort to munitions which are jammed at 
the front,

2476
02:32:04,951 --> 02:32:07,980
are removed.
The derailed carriage is lifted by means

2477
02:32:07,981 --> 02:32:12,981
of a winch and then the route is free.
Now the vehicles can get through and 

2478
02:32:12,981 --> 02:32:17,151
they start up again.
We then come to the worst part of the 

2479
02:32:17,151 --> 02:32:20,301
road.
Thick clay allows us to go forward only 

2480
02:32:20,301 --> 02:32:22,560
gradually at every moment a wagon and 
it's driver gets stuck.

2481
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:27,800
Reserved teams are sent forward.
Bridges over streams are especially 

2482
02:32:27,800 --> 02:32:29,670
difficult to cross and on top of that 
we're under heavy fire

2483
02:32:30,170 --> 02:32:35,170
and to quote,
but the fact that the troops aren't 

2484
02:32:35,170 --> 02:32:39,931
getting supplies becomes part of the 
reason why they can't continue to push 

2485
02:32:39,931 --> 02:32:44,371
on at the pace that the German high 
command wants them to push on the pace 

2486
02:32:44,371 --> 02:32:46,330
that they're going to have to push on if
they want to achieve these objectives.

2487
02:32:47,940 --> 02:32:52,940
Princess Evelyn blue shirt or the 
English wife of the German nobleman who 

2488
02:32:52,940 --> 02:32:56,630
quoted a few times before as a story 
about letters that their family was 

2489
02:32:57,151 --> 02:33:02,151
receiving from family members who were 
in these battles and when you read them,

2490
02:33:03,270 --> 02:33:08,270
you hear about an army that is literally
starving and exhausted.

2491
02:33:10,110 --> 02:33:10,980
She writes,
quote,

2492
02:33:12,850 --> 02:33:16,870
they say that no words can describe the 
horrors of what they've been through.

2493
02:33:17,110 --> 02:33:19,660
They write that they're almost dying of 
starvation.

2494
02:33:19,870 --> 02:33:23,710
They say they advanced so rapidly that 
no provisions could reach them and their

2495
02:33:23,711 --> 02:33:28,711
division was five days and nights 
fighting incessantly without food or 

2496
02:33:28,711 --> 02:33:32,851
even sleep at all.
And those of their companies who were 

2497
02:33:32,851 --> 02:33:33,340
not killed or wounded,
died of exhaustion.

2498
02:33:33,550 --> 02:33:37,390
And it is only by a miracle that they 
themselves are left to tell the tale.

2499
02:33:37,630 --> 02:33:39,850
There letter ends with the significant 
words,

2500
02:33:39,880 --> 02:33:44,880
quote,
send us some food somehow as quickly as 

2501
02:33:44,880 --> 02:33:44,880
you can,
or we also show them

2502
02:33:44,900 --> 02:33:46,970
die.
End Quote.

2503
02:33:48,200 --> 02:33:52,040
She then comments about the situation in
this little village where she lives,

2504
02:33:52,850 --> 02:33:56,390
the peasants and village people received
the news that sometimes one,

2505
02:33:56,570 --> 02:33:59,930
sometimes even two of their sons had 
been killed on the same day.

2506
02:34:00,140 --> 02:34:01,490
It has been wholesale slaughter

2507
02:34:01,550 --> 02:34:06,300
of light and quote.
Given that situation,

2508
02:34:06,900 --> 02:34:11,900
it's not hard to understand how once 
these troops began to push forward into 

2509
02:34:14,910 --> 02:34:19,910
allied controlled area and see the 
supply dumps and the stores and all 

2510
02:34:22,511 --> 02:34:24,070
these things that the allied troops 
have.

2511
02:34:24,071 --> 02:34:25,360
It's funny,
if you read their accounts,

2512
02:34:25,390 --> 02:34:28,150
they think they were suffering,
right?

2513
02:34:28,151 --> 02:34:33,151
I mean,
I remember reading one where the guy 

2514
02:34:33,151 --> 02:34:33,151
said British soldier saying,
you know,

2515
02:34:33,151 --> 02:34:33,730
we're eating dog biscuits were 
practically starving,

2516
02:34:34,210 --> 02:34:37,870
but these Germans come across with these
British forces have.

2517
02:34:38,770 --> 02:34:43,770
And they just stopped.
In some cases Gj Meyer quotes a famous 

2518
02:34:44,101 --> 02:34:44,610
piece

2519
02:34:45,930 --> 02:34:50,930
about a soldier investigating why the 
advance wasn't moving forward.

2520
02:34:51,780 --> 02:34:56,320
A German captain writing about events on
March 26th St.

2521
02:34:56,410 --> 02:35:01,410
quote today,
the advance of our infantry stopped 

2522
02:35:01,410 --> 02:35:01,410
nearer.
I'll bear.

2523
02:35:01,410 --> 02:35:04,680
Nobody could understand why our airmen 
had reported no enemy between our bear.

2524
02:35:04,830 --> 02:35:05,520
And um,
yeah,

2525
02:35:05,760 --> 02:35:09,570
the enemy's guns were only firing now 
and again on the very edge of affairs.

2526
02:35:09,780 --> 02:35:14,780
Our way seemed entirely clear.
I jumped into a car with orders to find 

2527
02:35:14,780 --> 02:35:16,080
out what was causing the stoppage at the
front.

2528
02:35:16,500 --> 02:35:20,100
As soon as I got near the town,
I began to see curious sites,

2529
02:35:20,370 --> 02:35:25,370
strange figures who looked very little 
like soldiers and certainly showed no 

2530
02:35:25,370 --> 02:35:27,510
signs of advancing were making their way
back.

2531
02:35:27,750 --> 02:35:30,890
There were men driving cows before them 
on a line.

2532
02:35:31,140 --> 02:35:36,140
Others who carried a hen under one arm 
and a box of note paper under the other 

2533
02:35:36,140 --> 02:35:38,220
men carrying a bottle of wine under 
their arm.

2534
02:35:38,220 --> 02:35:42,450
And another one opened in their hand,
man who had torn a silk drawing room,

2535
02:35:42,451 --> 02:35:47,451
curtain Rod,
and we're dragging it to the rear as a 

2536
02:35:47,451 --> 02:35:49,590
useful piece of loot men with writing 
paper and colored notebooks.

2537
02:35:49,591 --> 02:35:54,591
Evidently they'd founded desirable to 
sack a or shop men dressed up in comic 

2538
02:35:55,201 --> 02:35:58,140
disguise.
Men with top hats on their heads,

2539
02:35:58,320 --> 02:36:01,290
men staggering men who could hardly 
walk.

2540
02:36:01,530 --> 02:36:06,530
When I got into the town,
the streets were running with wine out 

2541
02:36:06,530 --> 02:36:09,831
of a seller came a lieutenant of the 
second marine division helpless and in 

2542
02:36:09,831 --> 02:36:11,550
despair.
I asked him what is going to happen?

2543
02:36:11,700 --> 02:36:13,500
It was essential for them to get 
forward.

2544
02:36:13,501 --> 02:36:16,620
Immediately.
He replied solemnly and emphatically.

2545
02:36:16,890 --> 02:36:21,090
I cannot get my men out of the seller 
without bloodshed and to quote,

2546
02:36:23,400 --> 02:36:25,980
but in addition to the logistical and 
supply exhaustion,

2547
02:36:25,981 --> 02:36:30,981
there's another kind of exhaustion that 
plays into all these world war one 

2548
02:36:30,981 --> 02:36:34,101
offensives and it's human exhaustion.
It's the part where human beings simply 

2549
02:36:35,021 --> 02:36:37,350
come to the end of their limit.
You know,

2550
02:36:37,370 --> 02:36:42,370
when you,
when you can fight a battle the way you 

2551
02:36:42,370 --> 02:36:42,370
want to,
you rotate people out.

2552
02:36:42,370 --> 02:36:44,620
So after a unit is so tired,
they're not useful anymore,

2553
02:36:44,820 --> 02:36:49,820
you know,
you take them out of the line and you 

2554
02:36:49,820 --> 02:36:49,820
replace them by fresh troops.
But in these battles,

2555
02:36:49,820 --> 02:36:51,010
and especially on the German side,
this was very difficult to do

2556
02:36:52,140 --> 02:36:55,770
and they didn't.
So the same troops are fighting for days

2557
02:36:55,771 --> 02:36:57,690
and they're dropping where they stand.
I mean,

2558
02:36:58,050 --> 02:36:59,630
if you believe the princess blue shirt 
letter,

2559
02:36:59,640 --> 02:37:01,110
they're dying from exhaustion,

2560
02:37:03,010 --> 02:37:07,900
but if you think about how being this 
tired affects your ability to resist and

2561
02:37:07,901 --> 02:37:12,901
your willingness to continue onward,
I mean we're sitting in the comfort of 

2562
02:37:13,061 --> 02:37:17,960
our recording studio here,
overwhelmed by these people's ability to

2563
02:37:17,961 --> 02:37:22,961
put up with the shelling and the 
conditions and the dead bodies and all 

2564
02:37:22,961 --> 02:37:26,750
that stuff,
but that's when you think of them having

2565
02:37:26,751 --> 02:37:31,751
a full belly and a good night's sleep.
Imagine it when you haven't slept in 

2566
02:37:31,751 --> 02:37:35,840
days and you're starving to death and 
the Second World War.

2567
02:37:35,990 --> 02:37:40,990
Some of these armies will sometimes use 
things like amphetamines to prolong the 

2568
02:37:40,990 --> 02:37:44,330
amount of time people could endure 
before they hit the exhaustion point.

2569
02:37:44,750 --> 02:37:49,000
I've seen it blamed by some historians 
for some of the more infamous massacres.

2570
02:37:49,370 --> 02:37:52,550
You have troops that had been up for 12 
days straight using speed.

2571
02:37:52,880 --> 02:37:57,880
They might not be as rational or as I'm 
collected as,

2572
02:37:58,641 --> 02:38:00,830
um,
they might've been 12 days previously.

2573
02:38:03,810 --> 02:38:08,810
I'm part of why these exhausted soldiers
aren't able to force anything to a 

2574
02:38:08,810 --> 02:38:10,350
conclusion that they're,
they're moving forward.

2575
02:38:10,470 --> 02:38:12,450
They've been successful.
They've been reinforced.

2576
02:38:13,020 --> 02:38:16,440
But they don't have any mobility 
throughout all of human history.

2577
02:38:16,441 --> 02:38:19,650
Cavalry had sort of played the role of 
what they needed.

2578
02:38:19,651 --> 02:38:24,651
Now,
someone that could rush forward and 

2579
02:38:24,651 --> 02:38:26,871
attack retreating or troops who are at 
least pulling back really so you know 

2580
02:38:26,871 --> 02:38:31,430
all sorts of chaos in the enemy rear.
The Germans need tanks and they need 

2581
02:38:31,430 --> 02:38:34,890
armored personnel carriers and they 
won't have it for another world war.

2582
02:38:36,030 --> 02:38:41,030
Their opponents do have these things.
They unveiled the tank a year before 

2583
02:38:41,030 --> 02:38:45,741
this time period and they've become 
better and are getting continually 

2584
02:38:45,741 --> 02:38:49,821
better at figuring out how to use it.
Initially the German high command had 

2585
02:38:49,821 --> 02:38:53,721
scoffed at this whole tank idea,
but they're taking it more and more 

2586
02:38:53,721 --> 02:38:53,721
seriously as time goes on.

2587
02:38:53,730 --> 02:38:58,730
They wish they had some tanks.
Now I bet because these exhausted 

2588
02:38:58,730 --> 02:39:01,821
soldiers are only able to march forward,
historian John Terraine considers this 

2589
02:39:02,041 --> 02:39:07,041
to have been almost criminal,
that the German high command launches 

2590
02:39:07,041 --> 02:39:11,811
these offensives to win the war,
but don't give the troops any way to 

2591
02:39:11,811 --> 02:39:11,811
exploit their victory.
He said,

2592
02:39:11,811 --> 02:39:14,190
quote,
as the year would show,

2593
02:39:14,370 --> 02:39:18,420
the days of cavalry is an arm of 
exploitation on the modern battlefield.

2594
02:39:18,421 --> 02:39:23,340
We're over yet feeble as it was the 
cavalry was the only exploiting arm that

2595
02:39:23,341 --> 02:39:28,341
existed for the Germans to launch an 
offensive intended to win the war with 

2596
02:39:28,341 --> 02:39:32,250
none at all was not just foolish,
it was criminal end quote,

2597
02:39:34,070 --> 02:39:38,000
and it would allow the enemy to move 
reserves and help,

2598
02:39:38,001 --> 02:39:43,001
and the French have unleashed divisions 
of troops that come to the aid to and 

2599
02:39:43,001 --> 02:39:45,950
the resistance of the allies will 
stiffen heroically,

2600
02:39:46,150 --> 02:39:51,150
you know,
in front of this important railway 

2601
02:39:51,150 --> 02:39:51,260
juncture,
and the Germans would run out of gas.

2602
02:39:51,270 --> 02:39:56,270
Essentially.
They would be like that wave that lost 

2603
02:39:56,270 --> 02:39:59,081
the momentum at the end of the beach and
Luton Dorf years later.

2604
02:39:59,901 --> 02:40:04,901
Writing in his memoir is about what he 
knows is this important moment in his 

2605
02:40:04,901 --> 02:40:05,960
history.
Germany's history,

2606
02:40:05,961 --> 02:40:10,961
world history,
and that he's been criticized for a ton 

2607
02:40:10,961 --> 02:40:12,440
and here's the way he puts it.
In his memoirs,

2608
02:40:12,441 --> 02:40:16,320
quote,
the enemy's line was now becoming denser

2609
02:40:16,470 --> 02:40:19,050
and in places they were even attacking 
themselves.

2610
02:40:19,320 --> 02:40:22,140
While our armies were no longer strong 
enough to overcome them,

2611
02:40:22,141 --> 02:40:26,550
unaided the ammunition was not 
sufficient and supply became difficult.

2612
02:40:26,760 --> 02:40:31,760
The repair of roads and railways was 
taking too long in spite of all of our 

2613
02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:35,241
preparations.
You then goes on to say it was an 

2614
02:40:35,241 --> 02:40:39,381
established fact that the enemy's 
resistance was beyond our strength and 

2615
02:40:39,570 --> 02:40:44,570
quote on April Fifth Ludendorff calls 
off Operation Michael.

2616
02:40:48,170 --> 02:40:53,170
He's inflicted 178,000
casualties on the British Bam in 15 

2617
02:40:53,871 --> 02:40:57,150
days,
77,000

2618
02:40:57,180 --> 02:41:02,180
on the French,
but he suffered between 230 and 250,000

2619
02:41:03,171 --> 02:41:08,171
casualties himself.
For a man who launched this whole attack

2620
02:41:08,780 --> 02:41:13,780
out of a fear that American 
reinforcements were going to come and 

2621
02:41:13,780 --> 02:41:16,751
swamp the Germans through sheer numbers.
You can't trade lives at this rate and 

2622
02:41:16,751 --> 02:41:18,610
survive.
Alluded.

2623
02:41:18,620 --> 02:41:23,620
Dorf knows that,
but he's going to continue to punch 

2624
02:41:23,620 --> 02:41:26,861
because that's his plan.
He's hoping to land a clean shot 

2625
02:41:26,861 --> 02:41:26,861
somewhere.

2626
02:41:28,610 --> 02:41:31,610
The problem is is that there was so much
invested in Michael.

2627
02:41:32,510 --> 02:41:35,420
These offenses that had been planned for
months always do the best.

2628
02:41:35,421 --> 02:41:37,700
The troops.
Morale was always at its highest.

2629
02:41:39,930 --> 02:41:44,930
The failure was disheartening and the 
dead on the German side come 

2630
02:41:44,930 --> 02:41:48,660
disproportionately from their very best 
handpicked troops.

2631
02:41:50,490 --> 02:41:55,490
When you decide to use most of the 
rocket fuel and the very first punch,

2632
02:41:55,561 --> 02:41:58,050
you don't have a ton left for subsequent
punches,

2633
02:41:59,280 --> 02:42:03,090
and at this point Luton door starts 
getting really pointed,

2634
02:42:03,091 --> 02:42:06,540
not so nice questions from subordinates 
about what's he thinking here?

2635
02:42:06,930 --> 02:42:11,930
What are you going to do?
Some of Lewd and door staff is turning 

2636
02:42:12,451 --> 02:42:17,451
against him.
They're openly questioning his decision 

2637
02:42:17,451 --> 02:42:21,741
making in these situations.
At least one of [inaudible] responses to

2638
02:42:21,961 --> 02:42:26,961
his rebellious staff members made it 
into the history books he supposed to 

2639
02:42:26,961 --> 02:42:29,660
have said,
and one historian described it as acidly

2640
02:42:30,270 --> 02:42:33,840
quote,
what is the purpose of your croaking?

2641
02:42:34,320 --> 02:42:39,320
What do you want from me and my now to 
conclude peace at any price and quote,

2642
02:42:41,070 --> 02:42:45,960
they'll hum von Liebig who will be a 
field marshal in the next world.

2643
02:42:45,961 --> 02:42:50,961
War is openly critical of Luton,
Dorff and then says that on March 30,

2644
02:42:51,841 --> 02:42:55,350
first he totally lost his nerves and 
quote,

2645
02:42:56,340 --> 02:43:01,290
this is sorta the way they described a 
nervous breakdown back then,

2646
02:43:01,920 --> 02:43:06,920
and if Ludendorff had had one here and 
he may have had another one or he may 

2647
02:43:08,011 --> 02:43:13,011
have had the first one later,
there is going to be an increasingly 

2648
02:43:13,011 --> 02:43:15,280
period ahead for Luton Dorff and he's 
already showing signs of cracking.

2649
02:43:15,280 --> 02:43:20,280
If he'd had one,
then that would just put him as the 

2650
02:43:20,280 --> 02:43:23,100
second German military leader in this 
war to have a nervous breakdown.

2651
02:43:23,110 --> 02:43:28,110
The original architect who had to carry 
out the plan to win the war at the very 

2652
02:43:28,110 --> 02:43:28,110
start of the war,
have on mold.

2653
02:43:28,110 --> 02:43:33,070
He also lost his nerves.
Now you say to yourself,

2654
02:43:33,071 --> 02:43:35,320
who cares?
Why does it matter?

2655
02:43:35,920 --> 02:43:40,920
But if gluten Dorf is still basically 
the guy making all these decisions on 

2656
02:43:40,920 --> 02:43:45,120
what to do with all these punches and 
how to react when opportunities are 

2657
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:47,380
crises erupt,
his state of mind is key and if it isn't

2658
02:43:47,381 --> 02:43:50,350
clear,
how's his decision making going to be?

2659
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:55,810
It gets questioned increasingly as we 
continue onward.

2660
02:43:55,811 --> 02:44:00,370
The Second Punch arrives on April ninth,
so right after Michael is called off,

2661
02:44:00,670 --> 02:44:03,340
they launched Georgette.
Each of these punches,

2662
02:44:03,341 --> 02:44:04,600
as I said,
has its own name.

2663
02:44:04,690 --> 02:44:07,840
Georgette was supposed to be George,
but now it's been scaled back,

2664
02:44:07,841 --> 02:44:12,841
hence Georgette,
because of the huge losses that the 

2665
02:44:12,841 --> 02:44:13,930
first punch cost,
the Germans,

2666
02:44:14,800 --> 02:44:19,800
Georgette is launched in the north in 
flanders against in a really strong 

2667
02:44:19,800 --> 02:44:21,040
defenses where they've been fighting for
years.

2668
02:44:21,580 --> 02:44:24,220
These defenses had been weakened 
somewhat though because when the Germans

2669
02:44:24,221 --> 02:44:26,180
were busy throwing their first punch 
Hagen,

2670
02:44:26,210 --> 02:44:31,210
the British were rushing every unit that
they could spare down to where the 

2671
02:44:31,210 --> 02:44:32,440
fighting was and a bunch of those units 
had been up here in Flanders.

2672
02:44:32,800 --> 02:44:35,260
A lot of what Ludendorff is going to do 
with these punches,

2673
02:44:35,740 --> 02:44:37,470
as we said,
Mr,

2674
02:44:37,560 --> 02:44:40,180
create diversions.
It'd be the equivalent in a boxing match

2675
02:44:40,181 --> 02:44:43,780
of throwing a punch at someone's body to
get them to pull their hands down,

2676
02:44:43,870 --> 02:44:46,510
opening up their head,
and go to another punch.

2677
02:44:47,470 --> 02:44:49,960
This is where Ludina Dorf really wants 
to win the war though,

2678
02:44:49,961 --> 02:44:52,240
because up in the north here in 
Flanders,

2679
02:44:52,241 --> 02:44:57,241
his goal are the channel ports.
These ports right on the other side of 

2680
02:44:57,241 --> 02:44:59,890
the English Channel from Great Britain 
that are supplying everything,

2681
02:44:59,891 --> 02:45:03,220
the entire British army and in fact all 
of the stuff that they're bringing in,

2682
02:45:03,640 --> 02:45:08,640
you know,
to share with the French and everything 

2683
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:08,640
else.
It's a key area.

2684
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:09,370
Everybody knows it and when Georgette 
strikes,

2685
02:45:09,610 --> 02:45:10,490
once again,
Luton,

2686
02:45:10,491 --> 02:45:15,491
Doris got foggy weather helping him out 
and once again he somehow strikes units 

2687
02:45:15,491 --> 02:45:16,990
that are just shouldn't be in the line 
of fire.

2688
02:45:16,991 --> 02:45:20,740
They were actually moved to what was 
thought was a quiet part of the line and

2689
02:45:20,741 --> 02:45:25,741
then boom,
you have another German hurricane 

2690
02:45:25,741 --> 02:45:27,511
bombardment.
You have still some storm troopers left 

2691
02:45:27,511 --> 02:45:29,350
who were pursuing through this fog,
a poor Portuguese division.

2692
02:45:29,440 --> 02:45:33,160
This is truly becoming a world war now 
that we're supposed to be leaving.

2693
02:45:33,160 --> 02:45:38,160
The front that day gets just 
disintegrates in front of the artillery 

2694
02:45:38,321 --> 02:45:40,480
fire.
A British unit pulls back and you have a

2695
02:45:40,481 --> 02:45:44,590
very similar situation to exactly how 
Michael started this German penetration,

2696
02:45:44,710 --> 02:45:49,710
another soil,
your underpants moment when Haig once 

2697
02:45:49,710 --> 02:45:53,101
again pleads for you.
No help from the French and he gets 

2698
02:45:53,101 --> 02:45:55,690
some,
but it's sort of stingy in his mind.

2699
02:45:55,691 --> 02:46:00,691
How much he gets.
Remember Fatia squirreling away troops 

2700
02:46:00,691 --> 02:46:03,811
for this counterattack he wants to 
launch when the Germans are totally 

2701
02:46:03,811 --> 02:46:06,781
punched out,
but he has to gamble that he can be 

2702
02:46:06,781 --> 02:46:08,500
stingy with troops and not have Haig 
fold up.

2703
02:46:09,280 --> 02:46:11,630
No one knows whether or not that can 
happen.

2704
02:46:11,810 --> 02:46:16,810
Haig issues,
one of his most famous speeches or 

2705
02:46:16,810 --> 02:46:17,210
proclamations,
I guess you would say,

2706
02:46:17,211 --> 02:46:22,211
it's called the backs to the wall 
proclamation and it is literally one of 

2707
02:46:22,211 --> 02:46:25,250
those stand or die orders to the troops.
Very famous,

2708
02:46:25,251 --> 02:46:29,690
very stirring and rousing when the 
situation is grim quote.

2709
02:46:30,230 --> 02:46:35,230
Many amongst us are now tired to those.
I would say that victory will belong to 

2710
02:46:35,230 --> 02:46:39,530
the side which holds out the longest.
The French army is moving rapidly and in

2711
02:46:39,531 --> 02:46:43,070
great force to our support.
There is no other course open to watch,

2712
02:46:43,071 --> 02:46:48,071
but to fight it out,
every position must be held to the last 

2713
02:46:48,071 --> 02:46:51,581
man.
There must be no retirement with our 

2714
02:46:51,581 --> 02:46:52,730
backs to the wall and believing in the 
justice of our cause.

2715
02:46:52,880 --> 02:46:57,880
Each one of us must fight onto the end.
The safety of our homes and the freedom 

2716
02:46:57,880 --> 02:47:02,471
of man kind of like depends upon the 
conduct of each one of us at this 

2717
02:47:02,471 --> 02:47:05,940
critical moment in the quote.
Nonetheless.

2718
02:47:06,450 --> 02:47:07,170
Again,
Doodoo,

2719
02:47:07,260 --> 02:47:12,260
ferocious resistance.
I mean you have to think of both sides 

2720
02:47:12,260 --> 02:47:15,261
is absolutely straining to the maximum.
The British and the French are able to 

2721
02:47:15,691 --> 02:47:16,980
hold,
once again,

2722
02:47:18,410 --> 02:47:22,670
the logistical supplies and the human 
exhaustion and the casualty levels,

2723
02:47:23,080 --> 02:47:28,080
you know,
destroy the momentum of the German 

2724
02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:28,080
attack.
Again,

2725
02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:28,080
it's,
it's a mirror image.

2726
02:47:29,760 --> 02:47:34,760
It's the same thing that the allies have
had to face the last couple of years 

2727
02:47:34,760 --> 02:47:36,540
when they tried to launch a fences and 
then continue to maintain the momentum.

2728
02:47:38,600 --> 02:47:43,600
Georgette gets to within five miles of a
key objective and both sides by the way.

2729
02:47:46,791 --> 02:47:48,680
Oh yeah.
It's going to be mind numbing.

2730
02:47:48,681 --> 02:47:51,770
Suffer another 110,000
casualties each.

2731
02:47:53,030 --> 02:47:54,560
It's hard to get your mind around the 
numbers.

2732
02:47:54,561 --> 02:47:55,520
I always think,
you know,

2733
02:47:55,521 --> 02:48:00,521
you figure 50 to 60,000
people fill up your average sports 

2734
02:48:00,521 --> 02:48:01,310
stadium,
so you're a hundred and 10,000

2735
02:48:01,311 --> 02:48:02,930
number is,
you know,

2736
02:48:02,931 --> 02:48:05,780
a couple of sports stadiums and George 
yet by the way is small.

2737
02:48:05,810 --> 02:48:09,880
That's why it's named Georgette.
The big encounters are giving you,

2738
02:48:09,970 --> 02:48:13,970
you know,
multi hundreds of thousands of people on

2739
02:48:13,971 --> 02:48:16,670
May 27th,
almost a month later.

2740
02:48:16,910 --> 02:48:21,910
Luton door throws the third punch and 
it's a month later because it took that 

2741
02:48:21,910 --> 02:48:26,051
long to in a refit and reorganize and 
send replacements and have people in the

2742
02:48:26,961 --> 02:48:30,170
hospital that didn't have major wounds 
get sent back to the front.

2743
02:48:30,550 --> 02:48:35,550
I mean the exhaustion was such that it 
took a month to recover so that they 

2744
02:48:35,550 --> 02:48:38,591
could launch another one of these 
punches and it's called operation blue 

2745
02:48:38,591 --> 02:48:42,050
shirt and within a couple of days the 
French are discussing,

2746
02:48:42,051 --> 02:48:46,000
abandoning Paris,
moving the government to Bordeaux.

2747
02:48:47,290 --> 02:48:52,290
The British are panicked that if the 
French fold up here and it's a real 

2748
02:48:52,960 --> 02:48:57,960
possibility that they will.
That the British army will be trapped on

2749
02:48:58,120 --> 02:48:59,860
the continent,
on French soil.

2750
02:49:00,040 --> 02:49:05,040
They will be hostages in the minds of 
some of these people that we're 

2751
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:08,730
discussing coming up with a plan to get 
the troops out of France,

2752
02:49:09,150 --> 02:49:14,150
hostages to a an arm twisting German 
peace agreement right before the 

2753
02:49:15,241 --> 02:49:20,241
Americans can come and save Europe with 
their massive numbers of people the 

2754
02:49:20,761 --> 02:49:25,761
British would have had to knuckle under 
after the French were defeated in their 

2755
02:49:25,761 --> 02:49:29,391
army,
in its hundreds of thousands or low 

2756
02:49:29,391 --> 02:49:31,440
millions be held by the Germans for 
leverage.

2757
02:49:33,970 --> 02:49:38,970
What we've seen happen here is a replay 
of what we saw in both Michael and 

2758
02:49:38,970 --> 02:49:42,721
George,
yet where the Germans again have an 

2759
02:49:42,721 --> 02:49:44,401
initial breakthrough that shocking and 
unlike operation Michael were the 

2760
02:49:45,371 --> 02:49:50,371
Germans broke through and there really 
wasn't any super fantastic goal that 

2761
02:49:50,371 --> 02:49:52,090
they could strike at this time.
When they breakthrough,

2762
02:49:52,370 --> 02:49:57,190
it's near Paris.
The French capital Luton.

2763
02:49:57,200 --> 02:50:00,890
Dorf decides to reinforce this attack as
Ian passing him labels him,

2764
02:50:00,891 --> 02:50:02,690
and I think it's a pretty good label for
him.

2765
02:50:03,020 --> 02:50:06,890
He says he's ever the opportunist,
never the strategist,

2766
02:50:08,490 --> 02:50:11,160
but that can be taken kind of as a 
compliment to Luton.

2767
02:50:11,161 --> 02:50:16,161
Dorf thinks that the ID of pinning 
yourself down to one standard recipe,

2768
02:50:16,211 --> 02:50:18,440
your set of rules or objectives,
you know,

2769
02:50:18,450 --> 02:50:21,180
decreases flexibility and he makes a 
move toward Paris.

2770
02:50:21,181 --> 02:50:24,300
And we have this crisis again,
another soil your underpants moment.

2771
02:50:26,230 --> 02:50:30,220
Ferdinand farash provides as many troops
as he can without totally destroying his

2772
02:50:30,221 --> 02:50:32,830
opportunity to have a counter attack in 
the near future.

2773
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:39,000
The Americans unready untrained get 
thrown into the mix because of the 

2774
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:40,480
desperation of the times

2775
02:50:42,260 --> 02:50:42,900
they'll fight,
uh,

2776
02:50:42,901 --> 02:50:45,590
a small encounter at Chateau t area.
It's called.

2777
02:50:45,591 --> 02:50:50,591
And then they'll fight a famous battle 
in American military history called 

2778
02:50:50,591 --> 02:50:52,430
beetle wood.
And the Americans,

2779
02:50:52,431 --> 02:50:54,170
when they get into combat for the first 
time,

2780
02:50:54,560 --> 02:50:57,560
they fight like the Europeans fought in 
1914.

2781
02:50:58,780 --> 02:51:00,610
No,
they're not particularly enamored with,

2782
02:51:00,640 --> 02:51:03,020
with European warfare of what they've 
seen and what they've,

2783
02:51:03,021 --> 02:51:08,021
you know,
the friendship tried to train them and 

2784
02:51:08,021 --> 02:51:08,021
stuff.
They'd rather storm up San Juan Hill and

2785
02:51:08,021 --> 02:51:09,740
simply take these things.
Why are we being so,

2786
02:51:10,010 --> 02:51:12,080
you know,
conniving about it.

2787
02:51:12,081 --> 02:51:13,050
And why are we,
you know,

2788
02:51:13,051 --> 02:51:18,051
just go up and,
and a little dash and a little American 

2789
02:51:18,051 --> 02:51:20,591
aggressiveness.
And you'll clear out these trenches and 

2790
02:51:20,591 --> 02:51:21,170
then these Germans will be on the run 
because of this.

2791
02:51:21,440 --> 02:51:26,090
The Americans are taking 19,
14 level casualties.

2792
02:51:26,520 --> 02:51:27,740
I mean they'll suffer.
10,000

2793
02:51:27,741 --> 02:51:30,890
casualties at Bella would boom.
Welcome to the war.

2794
02:51:32,120 --> 02:51:35,870
Initial German reports say that the 
Americans are almost suicidally,

2795
02:51:35,900 --> 02:51:38,180
brave,
very good marksman,

2796
02:51:38,181 --> 02:51:41,870
but clumsily lead and the American 
artillery,

2797
02:51:42,260 --> 02:51:44,270
which is mostly stuff they borrowed from
the French.

2798
02:51:44,271 --> 02:51:46,070
They don't have any of their own heavy 
artillery,

2799
02:51:46,310 --> 02:51:49,910
doesn't know how to do basic things that
the European armies do all the time now,

2800
02:51:49,911 --> 02:51:54,911
like a creeping barrage.
That sort of level of cooperation and 

2801
02:51:54,911 --> 02:51:57,800
sophistication isn't yet part of the 
American arsenal,

2802
02:51:58,280 --> 02:52:03,280
but it makes it hard to conduct battles 
the way the Europeans do at this point.

2803
02:52:03,861 --> 02:52:08,861
Luton door says his fear about the 
Americans is that they can go and take 

2804
02:52:09,341 --> 02:52:14,341
over a quiet parts of the line from the 
French and British soldiers that are 

2805
02:52:14,341 --> 02:52:16,600
currently there,
allowing those soldiers to be moved into

2806
02:52:16,601 --> 02:52:18,460
positions where they can fight the 
Germans.

2807
02:52:19,630 --> 02:52:24,630
But there are 10,000
Americans a day arriving in France.

2808
02:52:25,750 --> 02:52:28,750
There are almost 300,000
by this time.

2809
02:52:28,750 --> 02:52:33,610
In the story,
and there will be 250,000

2810
02:52:33,670 --> 02:52:38,670
every month for the foreseeable future.
As the emperor and great military 

2811
02:52:38,670 --> 02:52:40,420
leader,
Napoleon said about troops,

2812
02:52:40,810 --> 02:52:45,810
quantity has a quality all its own.
And what Lewd endorphins going to find 

2813
02:52:45,810 --> 02:52:48,760
out is that the Americans make damn good
soldiers,

2814
02:52:50,170 --> 02:52:55,170
the Canadians and the Australians do two
and several historians,

2815
02:52:55,811 --> 02:53:00,811
John Keegan among them,
have started saying that by this point 

2816
02:53:00,811 --> 02:53:03,961
in the war,
the Canadian and Australian divisions 

2817
02:53:03,961 --> 02:53:04,600
are the shock armies of the British 
army.

2818
02:53:04,870 --> 02:53:08,950
The British had lost a ton of their own 
units in 1916 at the somme.

2819
02:53:08,951 --> 02:53:13,951
And at this point,
the Canadians and the Australians are 

2820
02:53:13,951 --> 02:53:14,020
healthier,
bigger,

2821
02:53:14,021 --> 02:53:19,021
stronger.
You're still getting sorted the pick of 

2822
02:53:19,021 --> 02:53:19,630
the litter.
Whereas these British formations involve

2823
02:53:19,631 --> 02:53:22,930
a lot more people that if you had your 
druthers,

2824
02:53:23,170 --> 02:53:24,940
should be back in civilian life,
you know,

2825
02:53:24,941 --> 02:53:28,900
with kids or still finishing up school 
or whatever it might be.

2826
02:53:29,850 --> 02:53:34,850
When the Canadians and Australians are 
so important at this point in the war 

2827
02:53:34,850 --> 02:53:36,340
that the German intelligence pays 
attention to where they are.

2828
02:53:36,940 --> 02:53:38,020
And,
um,

2829
02:53:38,410 --> 02:53:43,410
I read somewhere that said that if the 
German intelligence saw that the 

2830
02:53:43,410 --> 02:53:43,410
Canadians and the Australian,
uh,

2831
02:53:43,410 --> 02:53:47,761
divisions were right by each other.
They knew that some offensive was going 

2832
02:53:47,761 --> 02:53:50,801
to happen right there.
One German soldier quoted after being 

2833
02:53:50,801 --> 02:53:52,160
captured by the Canadians,
uh,

2834
02:53:52,240 --> 02:53:53,830
had,
had been shocked because he said,

2835
02:53:53,831 --> 02:53:55,930
we thought you were up north,
you know,

2836
02:53:55,931 --> 02:53:56,320
they,
they,

2837
02:53:56,321 --> 02:54:01,321
they monitored where they were when the 
Germans captured the Americans.

2838
02:54:01,720 --> 02:54:06,720
What had so impressed them was a 
combination of how strong and healthy 

2839
02:54:07,030 --> 02:54:09,410
the Americans were compared to,
you know,

2840
02:54:09,580 --> 02:54:14,580
the way that the soldiers that they were
either encountering or living with war 

2841
02:54:14,580 --> 02:54:18,310
and also that the equipment was so nice 
and pristine and you know,

2842
02:54:18,311 --> 02:54:23,311
they marveled at the quality of the 
leather and the belt buckles and all 

2843
02:54:23,311 --> 02:54:23,311
those things.

2844
02:54:23,311 --> 02:54:27,570
I mean,
[inaudible] the German army stuff at 

2845
02:54:27,570 --> 02:54:27,590
this point is we'll trash their kit as 
it would be called,

2846
02:54:27,591 --> 02:54:29,800
as is trashed.
The guns and whatnot are still good.

2847
02:54:29,801 --> 02:54:34,801
But in terms of clothing and whatnot,
the German army is looking pretty 

2848
02:54:34,801 --> 02:54:38,161
ragged.
There'll be two incidents that are 

2849
02:54:38,161 --> 02:54:41,011
celebrated in American history that show
the attitude of the Americans is we've 

2850
02:54:41,011 --> 02:54:43,870
always celebrated it.
One comes during a,

2851
02:54:43,900 --> 02:54:48,900
one of these early battles that involve 
Americans where they're going into 

2852
02:54:48,900 --> 02:54:51,181
action with the French,
and there's a moment in time where the 

2853
02:54:51,181 --> 02:54:53,311
French decided to call a tactical 
retreat because sometimes that's the 

2854
02:54:53,311 --> 02:54:53,311
right move to make,
you know,

2855
02:54:53,311 --> 02:54:53,590
from the,
from the playbook.

2856
02:54:53,890 --> 02:54:56,920
And they advise the American captain,
a Marine captain,

2857
02:54:56,921 --> 02:54:58,510
I believe that he should do the same 
thing.

2858
02:54:58,750 --> 02:55:00,820
And he famously says,
retreat.

2859
02:55:01,120 --> 02:55:02,860
Hell,
we only just got here.

2860
02:55:03,880 --> 02:55:08,880
And then there's another famous incident
that has gone down into American 

2861
02:55:08,880 --> 02:55:08,880
military law,
uh,

2862
02:55:08,880 --> 02:55:11,060
from these early battles where the 
Americans do too.

2863
02:55:11,060 --> 02:55:16,060
Their impetuosity and suicidal bravery 
as the German commander might say,

2864
02:55:17,090 --> 02:55:20,630
get themselves in trouble under fire and
tall grass with a machine gun,

2865
02:55:20,631 --> 02:55:22,310
pinning them down and mowing people 
down.

2866
02:55:22,760 --> 02:55:25,550
And at a certain point,
one of their officers and old marine who

2867
02:55:25,551 --> 02:55:30,551
had been at all the classic pre first 
World War marine encounters that had 

2868
02:55:30,551 --> 02:55:34,361
recently happened from the Spanish 
American war to the Philippines to 

2869
02:55:34,361 --> 02:55:37,841
Central America.
And all that kind of stuff is supposed 

2870
02:55:37,841 --> 02:55:37,841
to have stood up,
started walking forward,

2871
02:55:37,841 --> 02:55:40,310
firing his weapon from the hip and 
yelling at all the soldiers that were on

2872
02:55:40,311 --> 02:55:42,500
their stomachs in the tall grass.
Come on you.

2873
02:55:42,501 --> 02:55:44,390
Sons of bitches.
Do you want to live forever?

2874
02:55:45,560 --> 02:55:50,560
Once again,
the ending is a mirror image of the 

2875
02:55:50,560 --> 02:55:53,831
other punches,
physical and human exhaustion combined 

2876
02:55:53,831 --> 02:55:57,731
with logistical and supply nightmares 
combined with heroic resistance.

2877
02:55:57,771 --> 02:55:59,510
Again,
I can't emphasize enough.

2878
02:55:59,870 --> 02:56:03,620
These battles on both sides are fought 
with the ultimate know,

2879
02:56:03,790 --> 02:56:06,410
sort of frenzied striving.

2880
02:56:06,410 --> 02:56:11,410
I can't describe it any other way,
but the Germans are starting to get 

2881
02:56:11,410 --> 02:56:12,320
weaker.
As we said,

2882
02:56:12,321 --> 02:56:17,321
they burned their rocket fuel.
They're down to people that they had 

2883
02:56:17,321 --> 02:56:21,520
planned to be the troops that you put in
the trenches that the better troops had 

2884
02:56:21,520 --> 02:56:26,111
already conquered to serve in the rear 
and just kind of be the last line of 

2885
02:56:26,111 --> 02:56:30,041
defense and and a lot of their best 
weapons were taken and given to the 

2886
02:56:30,041 --> 02:56:32,801
other troops.
They've never been trained in the new 

2887
02:56:32,801 --> 02:56:32,801
fire and movement,
the storm troop tactics.

2888
02:56:32,801 --> 02:56:37,420
And yet,
these are the people now who have to 

2889
02:56:37,420 --> 02:56:39,011
make the last few of these punches work 
when the better troops at a higher state

2890
02:56:39,081 --> 02:56:42,350
of morale at a better time couldn't make
it happen.

2891
02:56:43,190 --> 02:56:46,640
The fourth punches thrown June ninth.
It's called [inaudible] now.

2892
02:56:47,260 --> 02:56:52,260
And this time you don't see that initial
period where the Germans are able to,

2893
02:56:53,080 --> 02:56:58,080
you know,
make great progress before they're 

2894
02:56:58,080 --> 02:56:58,080
stopped here.

2895
02:56:58,080 --> 02:57:00,460
They're just stopped by this time.
The Kaiser sherlocked has cost the 

2896
02:57:00,460 --> 02:57:03,740
German army between half a million and 
750,000

2897
02:57:03,741 --> 02:57:08,741
casualties.
Remember this punch of theirs that they 

2898
02:57:08,991 --> 02:57:12,000
were going to throw was about a million 
two,

2899
02:57:12,001 --> 02:57:14,000
a million,
300,000

2900
02:57:14,090 --> 02:57:19,090
man fist,
and now it's condition is a little like 

2901
02:57:19,090 --> 02:57:23,531
what the condition of your fist would be
if you had been throwing it multiple 

2902
02:57:23,531 --> 02:57:26,120
times into a hard object.
First it gets nicked,

2903
02:57:26,600 --> 02:57:28,940
then it gets sliced up,
it starts to bleed,

2904
02:57:29,420 --> 02:57:34,420
and then it starts to break.
And if that wasn't enough,

2905
02:57:34,431 --> 02:57:39,431
there are two other things impacting the
ability of the German army to continue 

2906
02:57:39,431 --> 02:57:43,541
to fight like this one is perhaps the 
worst disease in human history.

2907
02:57:43,911 --> 02:57:48,350
Certainly top five on anyone's list in 
terms of nasty epidemics,

2908
02:57:48,800 --> 02:57:53,800
it's known to history as the Spanish flu
and it probably killed between 50 and 

2909
02:57:57,400 --> 02:58:02,400
100 million people at a time when the 
population was less than 2 billion.

2910
02:58:04,430 --> 02:58:09,430
Some 500 million people will come down 
with it and in June and July right at 

2911
02:58:10,640 --> 02:58:12,950
the time when all these encounters are 
taking place,

2912
02:58:12,951 --> 02:58:17,951
a half million German soldiers have it 
in addition to an actual contagion.

2913
02:58:20,210 --> 02:58:23,360
They're dealing in the German army now 
with an intellectual one.

2914
02:58:24,830 --> 02:58:29,830
The fire that Dorf had started in his 
next door neighbors apartment is now 

2915
02:58:31,010 --> 02:58:36,010
coming home to roost and as we said,
it is so hard to figure out from the 

2916
02:58:36,010 --> 02:58:36,230
memoirs,
you know,

2917
02:58:36,231 --> 02:58:39,020
how much of these people are actually 
bolsheviks,

2918
02:58:39,260 --> 02:58:44,260
how much of them are much more moderate 
socialists and how much of it or just 

2919
02:58:44,260 --> 02:58:45,500
people that have decided that the war 
should be over.

2920
02:58:45,620 --> 02:58:50,620
Guys like Ludendorff and Hitler,
they put them all in the same category 

2921
02:58:50,620 --> 02:58:54,380
and by 1918 is the replacements are 
coming to these German units.

2922
02:58:54,381 --> 02:58:59,381
When they need reinforcements from home.
They are people that have been touched.

2923
02:59:00,830 --> 02:59:04,670
Shall we say by the intellectual 
contagion,

2924
02:59:05,090 --> 02:59:10,090
let loose in Russia by the German high 
command to undermine their willingness 

2925
02:59:10,161 --> 02:59:15,161
to continue the war,
and now they're part of these German 

2926
02:59:15,161 --> 02:59:19,280
units.
Author Adam Hochschild writes some stuff

2927
02:59:19,281 --> 02:59:24,281
on the Americans and then shifts gears 
towards this intellectual contagion 

2928
02:59:24,471 --> 02:59:28,610
issue that Dorf endorphins sort of in a 
car makes sort of sense.

2929
02:59:28,620 --> 02:59:30,750
Beginning to reap.
He writes,

2930
02:59:30,751 --> 02:59:33,960
quote,
in addition to confronting Americans,

2931
02:59:33,961 --> 02:59:37,200
eager for battle,
the German high command found danger and

2932
02:59:37,201 --> 02:59:42,201
another quarter the impact of the 
Russian revolution was beginning to 

2933
02:59:42,201 --> 02:59:45,150
ripple through the German army.
As its divisions of eastern front troops

2934
02:59:45,151 --> 02:59:50,151
were transported to France and Belgium,
the generals discovered that 

2935
02:59:50,151 --> 02:59:54,141
revolutionary ideas had come with them,
having read German language newspapers 

2936
02:59:54,141 --> 02:59:58,911
distributed by the Bolsheviks or 
fraternized with soldiers from the fast 

2937
02:59:58,911 --> 02:59:59,340
dissolving.
Russian army.

2938
02:59:59,640 --> 03:00:02,010
Many had lost.
All Ardor for combat.

2939
03:00:02,520 --> 03:00:07,520
Quote are victorious army on the eastern
front became rotten with bolshevism.

2940
03:00:07,800 --> 03:00:12,540
A senior German general told an American
newspaper after the war quote,

2941
03:00:12,810 --> 03:00:15,180
we got to the point where we did not 
dare transfer.

2942
03:00:15,181 --> 03:00:18,600
A certain of our eastern division is to 
the west end quote.

2943
03:00:18,810 --> 03:00:20,340
Hochschild continues,
quote,

2944
03:00:20,790 --> 03:00:23,940
soldiers shipped to the western front,
turned rowdy,

2945
03:00:24,120 --> 03:00:28,200
firing shots from train windows and from
one troop train in May,

2946
03:00:28,201 --> 03:00:33,201
19,
18 carrying 631 men 83 deserted along 

2947
03:00:33,201 --> 03:00:38,091
the way.
Cynical troops chocked capital for 

2948
03:00:38,091 --> 03:00:39,360
flanders on the side of the railway 
cars,

2949
03:00:39,600 --> 03:00:44,190
taking them west and in half a dozen 
German cities underground network sprang

2950
03:00:44,191 --> 03:00:49,191
up to aid deserters,
left sympathizers provided men with 

2951
03:00:49,191 --> 03:00:49,470
shelter,
money,

2952
03:00:49,560 --> 03:00:54,560
forged papers and ration cards and 
instructions on the best spots to slip 

2953
03:00:54,560 --> 03:00:57,630
across the border into neutral Holland.
And quote

2954
03:00:59,510 --> 03:01:00,800
a little over a month

2955
03:01:00,800 --> 03:01:05,420
after the fourth German Punch denies now
is halted quickly.

2956
03:01:06,020 --> 03:01:09,560
Ludin Dorf throws the fifth punch.
And by the way,

2957
03:01:09,561 --> 03:01:14,561
he's planning on a sixth punch up in 
flanders again where Georgette just 

2958
03:01:15,291 --> 03:01:18,800
failed.
But first this fifth punch maybe to draw

2959
03:01:18,830 --> 03:01:22,460
reserves away from Flanders and to who 
knows,

2960
03:01:22,461 --> 03:01:24,320
you know,
punch a hole and see what happens.

2961
03:01:25,460 --> 03:01:28,370
It's known to history as the second 
battle of the Marne.

2962
03:01:29,430 --> 03:01:34,430
And the reason why people remember this 
name so well is because instead of the 

2963
03:01:34,581 --> 03:01:39,581
Germans breaking through and having this
early success at the second battle of 

2964
03:01:39,581 --> 03:01:41,930
the Marne,
they get hammered back.

2965
03:01:43,280 --> 03:01:46,790
They launch a pincer movement at a,
at a couple of French cities in one side

2966
03:01:46,791 --> 03:01:48,890
of the pincer is immediately stopped.
The other side,

2967
03:01:49,310 --> 03:01:50,930
you know,
goes on for a couple of days,

2968
03:01:50,960 --> 03:01:53,090
slow grinding advance,
and then it stopped.

2969
03:01:53,420 --> 03:01:58,420
And then the French military leader,
the Generalissimo now of the allied on 

2970
03:01:59,091 --> 03:02:04,091
ton forces,
Ferdinand foshe launches a counter 

2971
03:02:04,091 --> 03:02:04,700
attack.
Now,

2972
03:02:04,701 --> 03:02:09,701
historians disagree over whether or not 
this counterattack counts as the 

2973
03:02:09,701 --> 03:02:12,170
beginning of the big counter attack that
foss has been saving up for.

2974
03:02:12,350 --> 03:02:17,350
Some say it does.
Others say that this counter attack is 

2975
03:02:17,350 --> 03:02:19,550
more something designed to stop this 
battle.

2976
03:02:19,730 --> 03:02:22,160
And the next countertack is the 
beginning of the big push.

2977
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:28,000
Nonetheless,
within two days of the second battle of 

2978
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:30,670
the Marne being launched by Luton Dorf,
the allies are counterattacking

2979
03:02:31,880 --> 03:02:35,930
and they're doing it using essentially 
second world war tactics.

2980
03:02:38,520 --> 03:02:43,520
They hit the Germans in the flank,
they hit a part of the salient that's a 

2981
03:02:43,771 --> 03:02:45,900
rear area essentially.
And the Germans are,

2982
03:02:45,901 --> 03:02:50,901
they're trying to cut down some wheat 
that they've just advanced into because 

2983
03:02:50,901 --> 03:02:54,681
they're starving and then with no 
warning at all and artillery barrage 

2984
03:02:56,170 --> 03:03:00,000
just starts and instead of it,
you know,

2985
03:03:00,010 --> 03:03:02,050
hitting various positions all over the 
place,

2986
03:03:02,440 --> 03:03:07,440
the shells instantly come together to 
form one of those creeping barrages,

2987
03:03:08,410 --> 03:03:13,410
those walls of explosions.
And then the creeping barrage instantly 

2988
03:03:13,410 --> 03:03:17,731
starts moving forward like a giant 
moving hurricane heading toward German 

2989
03:03:19,391 --> 03:03:24,391
troops behind this hurricane of shells.
This wall of explosions is a giant smoke

2990
03:03:27,631 --> 03:03:32,631
screen and charging out of a forest 
where they've been hiding our hundreds 

2991
03:03:33,981 --> 03:03:35,090
of light tanks

2992
03:03:36,550 --> 03:03:40,630
followed by infantry and with aircrafts 
swooping down,

2993
03:03:40,780 --> 03:03:44,140
conducting what we call now ground 
attack missions,

2994
03:03:44,530 --> 03:03:47,830
which is something that did not even 
exist three years previously.

2995
03:03:48,820 --> 03:03:52,080
These tanks didn't either.
Not only are these tanks and you know,

2996
03:03:52,140 --> 03:03:54,400
hundreds of them in one place is very 
uncommon.

2997
03:03:54,670 --> 03:03:58,940
These are a new kind of tanked,
a light tank that even Ludin Dorf has to

2998
03:03:58,941 --> 03:04:03,941
acknowledge in his memoirs,
made a big difference because they're 

2999
03:04:03,941 --> 03:04:04,930
fast.
Well,

3000
03:04:05,750 --> 03:04:08,840
they can move at the speed of a jogging 
man where the heavy tanks,

3001
03:04:08,841 --> 03:04:13,841
which are the size of a school bus and 
have 15 to 20 people in the move at the 

3002
03:04:13,841 --> 03:04:18,341
speed of a walking man,
hundreds of the tanks at once make a 

3003
03:04:18,341 --> 03:04:21,881
huge difference as well,
and what their job is is to go take out 

3004
03:04:21,881 --> 03:04:24,380
the things that are so damaging to the 
infantry,

3005
03:04:24,590 --> 03:04:27,200
thereby making it safe for the infantry 
to advance.

3006
03:04:27,200 --> 03:04:32,200
Remember what the first World War did 
was combined a bunch of new weapons 

3007
03:04:32,200 --> 03:04:36,131
systems together.
The changed everything to have the most 

3008
03:04:36,131 --> 03:04:37,370
important of them were machine guns and 
barbed wire.

3009
03:04:38,150 --> 03:04:41,960
The first thing these tanks do is crush 
the barbed wire and go after the machine

3010
03:04:41,961 --> 03:04:46,961
guns.
Machine guns can't hurt the tanks and 

3011
03:04:46,961 --> 03:04:46,961
what they basically do,
they often don't even use their guns.

3012
03:04:46,961 --> 03:04:49,730
They often just drive right over the 
machine gun nest,

3013
03:04:49,731 --> 03:04:52,580
any of their crushed the people inside 
or force them to flee,

3014
03:04:52,940 --> 03:04:57,940
but this opens up the battlefield for 
the infantry who are following close 

3015
03:04:57,940 --> 03:05:01,661
behind Luton.
Dorf also mentions in his memoirs that 

3016
03:05:01,661 --> 03:05:06,551
the French are using.
He calls them tanks that hold infantry 

3017
03:05:06,680 --> 03:05:09,800
and he says,
this infantry drives up in the tank onto

3018
03:05:09,801 --> 03:05:12,740
the battlefield.
Dismounts sets up a machine gun nest and

3019
03:05:12,741 --> 03:05:14,960
the and the tank goes back to pick up 
more infantry.

3020
03:05:15,020 --> 03:05:17,870
He's basically describing armored 
personnel carriers.

3021
03:05:18,740 --> 03:05:23,740
These generals throughout this war have 
been accused of being unimaginative.

3022
03:05:24,291 --> 03:05:29,291
Butchers are figuring out how to 
overcome the challenges of early 20th 

3023
03:05:30,321 --> 03:05:34,190
century warfare.
The Germans on their side have some very

3024
03:05:34,191 --> 03:05:35,990
forward thinking generals who are good 
at this.

3025
03:05:36,170 --> 03:05:38,480
The allies do to one of them's a 
Canadian guy,

3026
03:05:38,481 --> 03:05:40,570
another is an Australian general,
um,

3027
03:05:40,680 --> 03:05:44,210
Korean monash,
and they're coming up with new tactics.

3028
03:05:44,360 --> 03:05:49,360
The French have generals who were coming
up with new tactics and together they 

3029
03:05:49,360 --> 03:05:52,640
are overcoming the traditional things 
that slow down and offense,

3030
03:05:53,930 --> 03:05:56,630
you might call it a form of Provo 
Blitzkrieg,

3031
03:05:58,310 --> 03:06:00,670
American soldier,
Elton Emac,

3032
03:06:00,671 --> 03:06:05,671
and was at this counter attack and had 
been told that there wouldn't be a 

3033
03:06:05,671 --> 03:06:07,730
preliminary barrage that this wall of 
steel,

3034
03:06:07,731 --> 03:06:12,731
this moving wall of steel would just 
appear instantly and in the infantry 

3035
03:06:12,731 --> 03:06:15,230
would rushing afterwards.
And he describes the situation like this

3036
03:06:15,710 --> 03:06:16,160
quote.

3037
03:06:16,700 --> 03:06:21,700
One instant there was silence and then 
the world went mad in a smashing burst 

3038
03:06:21,700 --> 03:06:23,660
of sound.
Men caught off.

3039
03:06:23,661 --> 03:06:28,190
Balance were hurled to the earth,
which shook against the guns minds.

3040
03:06:28,220 --> 03:06:33,220
Stupefied refused all function for a 
moment and rebuild everything within 100

3041
03:06:33,561 --> 03:06:38,561
yards was nod in bitter tearing bites at
men and trees and wire.

3042
03:06:39,170 --> 03:06:43,880
The stately forest melted beneath a 
raging storm of fire and steel,

3043
03:06:44,150 --> 03:06:49,150
heavy branches and tree trunks crush the
life out for men who coward among the 

3044
03:06:49,150 --> 03:06:51,650
roots for shelter.
One heard a furious,

3045
03:06:51,680 --> 03:06:55,160
awful screaming.
As the shell fire rolled away,

3046
03:06:55,350 --> 03:07:00,350
then mad waves of charging infantry came
after it mopping up and quote this 

3047
03:07:02,981 --> 03:07:07,981
allied counter offensive puts an end to 
all those punches that the German army 

3048
03:07:08,351 --> 03:07:13,110
had been throwing.
Ludendorff will very quickly cancel that

3049
03:07:13,111 --> 03:07:18,111
punch.
He was thinking about throwing up in 

3050
03:07:18,111 --> 03:07:20,091
flanders again and he'll put the German 
army on the defensive and the German 

3051
03:07:20,091 --> 03:07:23,280
army has now reached a point in this war
that is,

3052
03:07:23,430 --> 03:07:25,260
you know,
you see it in a lot of wars actually,

3053
03:07:25,261 --> 03:07:30,261
but it's that.
It's that point when you're not 

3054
03:07:30,261 --> 03:07:30,780
defeated,
but you can no longer when,

3055
03:07:32,410 --> 03:07:36,580
how you play that card,
when your Delta is very interesting

3056
03:07:39,220 --> 03:07:43,240
and once again makes us wonder about,
you know,

3057
03:07:43,241 --> 03:07:48,241
how sound the mind of the man who's 
going to play this card is during this 

3058
03:07:50,681 --> 03:07:55,681
time period,
Luton Dorf has been spotted by 

3059
03:07:55,681 --> 03:07:55,681
subordinates crying.

3060
03:07:56,810 --> 03:08:01,810
At one point they will carefully 
convinced him to go see a psychiatrist 

3061
03:08:03,270 --> 03:08:05,750
and the exchange is actually almost a 
little comical.

3062
03:08:05,751 --> 03:08:06,260
I mean,
you know,

3063
03:08:06,261 --> 03:08:08,750
these are human beings and we should 
have some sympathy,

3064
03:08:08,751 --> 03:08:11,900
but at the same time the,
the psychiatrist is saying things like,

3065
03:08:11,901 --> 03:08:13,820
you never get out.
You never smelled the air.

3066
03:08:13,821 --> 03:08:15,230
What was the last time you had some good
food?

3067
03:08:15,231 --> 03:08:15,540
You know,
it's,

3068
03:08:15,660 --> 03:08:16,730
it's,
it's just sort of a,

3069
03:08:16,731 --> 03:08:18,800
you never think about yourself and 
Ludendorff is going,

3070
03:08:18,801 --> 03:08:19,340
yes,
yes,

3071
03:08:19,341 --> 03:08:20,030
yes,
you're right.

3072
03:08:20,210 --> 03:08:22,220
It's all true,
but what can I do?

3073
03:08:22,330 --> 03:08:26,210
And then later says that the war has 
taken everything.

3074
03:08:27,560 --> 03:08:30,890
In one sense,
he's not exaggerating.

3075
03:08:31,610 --> 03:08:35,600
Soon after the German Michael Offensive 
Starts,

3076
03:08:35,601 --> 03:08:40,601
Luton Dorf motors into territory that 
had been recently conquered by the 

3077
03:08:40,601 --> 03:08:45,011
Germans and some of this ground 
contained graves and Luton door pulls up

3078
03:08:45,681 --> 03:08:47,140
in the car.
The story goes,

3079
03:08:47,540 --> 03:08:50,450
has them dig up the remains in one of 
the graves,

3080
03:08:50,780 --> 03:08:53,360
and he identifies his son,

3081
03:08:54,810 --> 03:08:59,810
also named Eric Luton Dorf.
Now this is a stepson actually,

3082
03:09:00,300 --> 03:09:05,300
but supposedly he was as close to them 
as biological sons and this was the 

3083
03:09:05,300 --> 03:09:09,021
second son that he'd lost in this war.
Also the second pilot,

3084
03:09:11,040 --> 03:09:16,040
and you know,
it's interesting to sort of compare and 

3085
03:09:16,040 --> 03:09:16,710
contrast.
This is the last war where you see a lot

3086
03:09:17,070 --> 03:09:18,450
of famous,
powerful,

3087
03:09:18,451 --> 03:09:21,330
important people lose their children in 
the war.

3088
03:09:22,380 --> 03:09:27,380
I can't think of another time period 
after this where it's been anything 

3089
03:09:27,380 --> 03:09:27,380
quite like this.
I mean,

3090
03:09:27,380 --> 03:09:28,920
not only just alluded to or Flus,
two step sons,

3091
03:09:28,950 --> 03:09:32,640
but just off the top of my head,
the prime minister who Britain,

3092
03:09:32,950 --> 03:09:37,950
you know,
went through the first two or so years 

3093
03:09:37,950 --> 03:09:37,950
of the war with Herbert Asquith.
He lost a son,

3094
03:09:37,950 --> 03:09:39,690
Ferdinand Foshe,
the generalist demo of the allies.

3095
03:09:39,691 --> 03:09:44,691
He lost a son.
And famously when he had been told the 

3096
03:09:44,691 --> 03:09:47,721
news,
he was busy in the middle of an 

3097
03:09:47,721 --> 03:09:47,721
offensive and doing stuff,
he was told the news,

3098
03:09:47,721 --> 03:09:51,111
he gave himself a half hour to grieve,
composed himself and got back to work.

3099
03:09:51,690 --> 03:09:54,000
Theodore Roosevelt,
the famous junkie,

3100
03:09:54,320 --> 03:09:56,920
encouraged his kids to get involved.
And then last one,

3101
03:09:58,270 --> 03:09:59,260
a pilot also.

3102
03:10:01,270 --> 03:10:06,020
It's hard to know how much losing his 
second son in this war affected Luton.

3103
03:10:06,030 --> 03:10:11,030
Dorf.
I'm tempted to feel it gets just one 

3104
03:10:11,030 --> 03:10:12,040
more straw weighing down the camel's 
back.

3105
03:10:12,790 --> 03:10:14,450
And he's in one of these positions,
you know,

3106
03:10:14,451 --> 03:10:19,451
I'm,
I'm always fascinated by the extreme 

3107
03:10:19,451 --> 03:10:21,340
human situations and Luton Doris in one 
of those positions now in history.

3108
03:10:21,341 --> 03:10:26,341
And there's a lot of people who've been 
in them whether under this extreme 

3109
03:10:26,341 --> 03:10:29,041
crushing stress.
And I always wonder how much they can 

3110
03:10:29,041 --> 03:10:31,321
take.
And is there a limit that everyone has 

3111
03:10:31,321 --> 03:10:33,961
or could you plug some other person with
some other personality type in the 

3112
03:10:33,961 --> 03:10:37,801
situation,
ludendorff scene and have them do 

3113
03:10:37,801 --> 03:10:37,801
better.
May Look at adults.

3114
03:10:37,801 --> 03:10:39,760
Hitler in the last four months of the 
Second World War.

3115
03:10:39,761 --> 03:10:44,761
He's under this crushing sword of 
Damocles pressure and he's this palsy 

3116
03:10:45,340 --> 03:10:50,340
rec.
Could you put someone else in that role 

3117
03:10:50,340 --> 03:10:50,340
and had them do much better?

3118
03:10:50,340 --> 03:10:52,390
I don't know where the limits of human 
endurance are,

3119
03:10:53,860 --> 03:10:57,610
but you know it's a question that's 
valid across the board.

3120
03:10:57,611 --> 03:11:00,520
You don't just want to ask it about the 
people at the top of the food chain,

3121
03:11:00,521 --> 03:11:05,521
like the lewd endorse.
You also want to ask it about the 

3122
03:11:05,521 --> 03:11:07,810
soldiers collectively in the fight,
how long can they endure,

3123
03:11:08,440 --> 03:11:10,570
and also about the people back home.
Remember,

3124
03:11:10,990 --> 03:11:15,550
one of the things that this war really 
inaugurated as the idea of total war,

3125
03:11:16,030 --> 03:11:18,610
although you can go back to other times 
in history and you see it,

3126
03:11:18,611 --> 03:11:23,611
but in the modern era,
total war means the involvement of the 

3127
03:11:23,611 --> 03:11:27,270
what's called the home front and all the
people are needed in this endeavor 

3128
03:11:27,270 --> 03:11:27,520
because they produce,
if nothing else,

3129
03:11:27,790 --> 03:11:29,410
you know all the munitions and 
everything.

3130
03:11:29,411 --> 03:11:31,510
The troops at the front need to keep 
fighting.

3131
03:11:31,810 --> 03:11:34,750
What happens when they reach the limits 
of their endurance.

3132
03:11:37,330 --> 03:11:42,330
Now,
this last part of the war in the last 

3133
03:11:42,330 --> 03:11:46,260
couple of months,
we'll be known as the hundred days is 

3134
03:11:46,260 --> 03:11:46,260
one of those,
you know,

3135
03:11:46,260 --> 03:11:50,450
it's not a heavily studied part of the 
war because it's not like the trench 

3136
03:11:50,450 --> 03:11:55,141
warfare part of the first world war,
but it's one of those occurrences that 

3137
03:11:55,141 --> 03:11:59,280
that when you read it,
it brings strange emotions to the fore 

3138
03:12:00,250 --> 03:12:05,250
because what you're watching is a sort 
of a doomed effort and the costs of the 

3139
03:12:07,511 --> 03:12:12,511
doomed effort are beyond belief and so 
as you watch it,

3140
03:12:12,521 --> 03:12:17,521
you don't know what to think because 
there's something unbelievably admirable

3141
03:12:18,940 --> 03:12:23,940
about the people in this story's 
willingness to sacrifice all for 

3142
03:12:24,820 --> 03:12:29,820
whatever reason,
but part of you just screams out at what

3143
03:12:31,491 --> 03:12:34,230
appears to a person not in that 
situation.

3144
03:12:34,231 --> 03:12:36,540
And let's be honest,
raised on much more cynical,

3145
03:12:36,541 --> 03:12:39,180
modern values.
What appears to be,

3146
03:12:39,540 --> 03:12:43,160
frankly not that smart,
right?

3147
03:12:43,161 --> 03:12:47,960
If you think that the war is over and 
you are looking at it from the early 20,

3148
03:12:47,961 --> 03:12:52,961
first century as we are and you watch 
these go through unbelievable things to 

3149
03:12:53,421 --> 03:12:54,950
prolong it,
you know,

3150
03:12:54,951 --> 03:12:59,951
one second longer or something you can't
help but feel like you want to scream 

3151
03:12:59,951 --> 03:13:01,910
out against the collective waste of it.
All right?

3152
03:13:02,600 --> 03:13:04,520
You know,
if you know that this is done,

3153
03:13:04,521 --> 03:13:08,330
why let this continue and it's a strange
emotion.

3154
03:13:08,331 --> 03:13:13,331
As I said,
there's something heroic about the last 

3155
03:13:13,331 --> 03:13:14,660
several months of the war

3156
03:13:15,730 --> 03:13:18,090
and one side of the heroism and,
and,

3157
03:13:18,150 --> 03:13:20,320
and again for people in the 21st 
century,

3158
03:13:20,321 --> 03:13:20,890
it's,
it's,

3159
03:13:20,910 --> 03:13:25,910
it's a little strange because we have 
the second world war intervening in the 

3160
03:13:25,910 --> 03:13:28,981
way we think about things in the second 
world war really had a good and evil 

3161
03:13:28,981 --> 03:13:32,041
feel to it.
The first world war was sold as a good 

3162
03:13:32,041 --> 03:13:33,370
and evil war and the people at the time 
period kind of treated it that way,

3163
03:13:33,580 --> 03:13:36,940
but a hundred years later as we are now,
you can look back on it and see.

3164
03:13:37,210 --> 03:13:41,290
It's really not a good evil war.
It's really more of a old line,

3165
03:13:41,291 --> 03:13:42,660
you know,
power of politics,

3166
03:13:42,661 --> 03:13:43,780
uh,
international relations.

3167
03:13:43,781 --> 03:13:44,170
I mean,
it's,

3168
03:13:44,230 --> 03:13:48,280
it's pretty representative in the much 
larger scale,

3169
03:13:48,310 --> 03:13:50,140
the kind of wars people have always 
fought.

3170
03:13:53,350 --> 03:13:58,350
And once you do that,
you can begin to see everyone's 

3171
03:13:58,350 --> 03:13:58,720
sacrifice in a certain light.
And as I said,

3172
03:13:59,680 --> 03:14:04,680
in a strange way,
the light that these people sacrifice 

3173
03:14:04,680 --> 03:14:07,860
really takes on in the last several 
months of the war is his heroism and the

3174
03:14:08,501 --> 03:14:13,501
very old grand sense of the term and 
maybe a sort of a doomed heroism.

3175
03:14:15,750 --> 03:14:17,430
And as we said before,
you know,

3176
03:14:17,431 --> 03:14:21,330
there's a very toll can ask feeling to 
the first world war.

3177
03:14:21,331 --> 03:14:24,030
And many people will say that that's not
an accident token.

3178
03:14:24,031 --> 03:14:25,950
As we've mentioned in an earlier 
episode,

3179
03:14:26,460 --> 03:14:31,460
was in this war as a soldier started 
writing the stuff that would become 

3180
03:14:31,460 --> 03:14:33,010
things like the Lord of the rings,
you know,

3181
03:14:33,030 --> 03:14:38,030
in this conflict based certain scenes of
the Lord of the rings on things he'd 

3182
03:14:38,030 --> 03:14:41,811
seen in this war.
And the way that token sort of underpins

3183
03:14:42,961 --> 03:14:47,961
his whole Lord of the rings story is a 
last alliance of the grand old peoples 

3184
03:14:49,161 --> 03:14:54,161
that used to be so powerful to take down
the dark power and then you know,

3185
03:14:55,741 --> 03:14:59,190
one of two things can happen.
Either they could lose to the dark power

3186
03:14:59,191 --> 03:15:04,191
and everything will be covered in 
darkness or they can beat the dark 

3187
03:15:04,191 --> 03:15:07,431
power,
but in so doing will so damage 

3188
03:15:07,431 --> 03:15:08,060
themselves that they're,
you know,

3189
03:15:08,070 --> 03:15:10,980
high water mark on the world stage will 
also be over.

3190
03:15:10,980 --> 03:15:15,980
It's a doomed victory.
And that's kind of what we're watching 

3191
03:15:15,980 --> 03:15:20,331
in these last couple of months of the 
war were a frightfully high amount of 

3192
03:15:21,241 --> 03:15:26,241
damage is being done to all sides in 
this effort to bring what's now a 

3193
03:15:26,241 --> 03:15:30,681
foregone conclusion to an end.
These people are dying over terms.

3194
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:36,000
Maybe you know,
can we kill enough of the enemy to make 

3195
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:38,880
them give us a little more leeway on 
this point in a peace treaty?

3196
03:15:39,630 --> 03:15:41,280
That's what these people are really 
dying for.

3197
03:15:41,700 --> 03:15:46,700
But they're dying in such large numbers 
that these will be mortal wounds really 

3198
03:15:47,341 --> 03:15:52,341
to the British and the French empires.
And if mortal wounds in terms of 

3199
03:15:52,341 --> 03:15:53,100
replaceability,
because eventually you can replace those

3200
03:15:53,101 --> 03:15:58,101
people,
may be mortal wounds on an imperial 

3201
03:15:58,101 --> 03:16:01,581
psyche whose cost was now appearing to 
be unsustainable.

3202
03:16:04,350 --> 03:16:09,350
On August eighth,
the allied powers launched the long 

3203
03:16:09,350 --> 03:16:13,311
awaited counterattack,
the punch back against the exhausted 

3204
03:16:13,311 --> 03:16:18,261
German forces in the hopes that you can 
snap back like a rubber band.

3205
03:16:18,751 --> 03:16:21,660
Everything that they had taken in the 
past couple of months,

3206
03:16:22,020 --> 03:16:24,480
they have washed up to the top of the 
beach as we said,

3207
03:16:24,481 --> 03:16:28,410
the tide that had run out of momentum.
And on August eighth,

3208
03:16:28,950 --> 03:16:33,950
they were hit with such extreme violence
in in several places that Ludin door,

3209
03:16:36,030 --> 03:16:40,680
we'll call it the black day of the 
German army in the history of this war,

3210
03:16:41,880 --> 03:16:46,880
and he'll call it that.
Not so much because the Germans were 

3211
03:16:46,880 --> 03:16:49,020
smashed and pushed backward,
but they were,

3212
03:16:49,770 --> 03:16:54,770
but because it seemed to be the first 
real confirmation that the morale limits

3213
03:16:56,491 --> 03:16:59,400
had been reached.
At least for some of these soldiers.

3214
03:17:00,910 --> 03:17:03,250
There were a ton of surrenders,
for example,

3215
03:17:03,251 --> 03:17:08,251
which is what had happened a couple of 
weeks before when the French had 

3216
03:17:08,251 --> 03:17:08,620
launched that battle with all those 
light tanks.

3217
03:17:08,621 --> 03:17:13,621
A lot of Germans surrendered.
Now they did again here and they didn't 

3218
03:17:13,621 --> 03:17:16,111
surrender in ones or twos.
You know guys that had been cornered in 

3219
03:17:16,111 --> 03:17:20,551
shell holes.
They came in groups heavily armed men 

3220
03:17:20,551 --> 03:17:25,030
led by junior officers who would 
surrender to the first allied officer.

3221
03:17:25,031 --> 03:17:25,900
They ran into

3222
03:17:27,370 --> 03:17:28,300
30,
50,

3223
03:17:28,301 --> 03:17:30,470
75 men at a time.
It was it.

3224
03:17:30,600 --> 03:17:33,190
It was a sign of something different 
because the Germans didn't do this.

3225
03:17:33,220 --> 03:17:36,730
It was a sign that we were reaching the 
limits of endurance.

3226
03:17:36,731 --> 03:17:41,731
At least for some of these units.
The army had become brittle and on 

3227
03:17:41,731 --> 03:17:44,050
August eighth you see that because some 
elements of the army held firm,

3228
03:17:44,350 --> 03:17:46,390
but when you're trying to keep a solid 
line,

3229
03:17:46,660 --> 03:17:51,660
if it gives away anywhere,
the enemy streams through that and then 

3230
03:17:51,660 --> 03:17:53,680
surrounds all the other position,
turning them into little islands amongst

3231
03:17:53,681 --> 03:17:58,681
the enemy.
And one of my favorite stories from 

3232
03:17:58,681 --> 03:18:01,681
August eighth because it really brings 
forward this sense of confusion is I'm 

3233
03:18:02,310 --> 03:18:07,310
an officer in the second line of Defense
who's in a bunker on a telephone trying 

3234
03:18:07,310 --> 03:18:09,730
to get news of what the heck's going on.
He could hear stuff.

3235
03:18:10,750 --> 03:18:13,690
It's foggy that day,
which is kind of like Mother Nature,

3236
03:18:13,980 --> 03:18:16,300
uh,
decided to equal the odds because it had

3237
03:18:16,301 --> 03:18:18,820
been foggy through so many of the 
punches.

3238
03:18:18,820 --> 03:18:20,590
The Germans had recently thrown in 
there.

3239
03:18:20,620 --> 03:18:21,400
Nineteen,
18,

3240
03:18:21,401 --> 03:18:23,110
spring offensive.
It seems only fair.

3241
03:18:23,320 --> 03:18:25,000
It would be foggy.
You know,

3242
03:18:25,001 --> 03:18:26,350
the day the allies,
countertack,

3243
03:18:26,410 --> 03:18:29,890
and it is in that bunker commander says 
you can't even see 10 feet out there.

3244
03:18:30,700 --> 03:18:35,700
And then as he's on the phone trying to 
figure out what's going on in aid comes 

3245
03:18:35,700 --> 03:18:36,700
down the stairs and says that the lines 
are broken and the enemy is,

3246
03:18:36,850 --> 03:18:37,360
has,
has,

3247
03:18:37,420 --> 03:18:40,810
has bypassed this readout and is behind 
them.

3248
03:18:41,020 --> 03:18:46,020
And he says that before the person 
speaking even gets the whole message 

3249
03:18:46,020 --> 03:18:48,961
out,
the grenades are rolling down his into 

3250
03:18:48,961 --> 03:18:50,050
his bunker.
In other words,

3251
03:18:50,051 --> 03:18:52,240
the enemies.
They are already throwing grenades.

3252
03:18:52,680 --> 03:18:56,140
So to sum up how August eighth looked 
and the allies,

3253
03:18:56,141 --> 03:18:57,360
um,
in the north up,

3254
03:18:57,390 --> 03:18:57,790
I'm,
yeah,

3255
03:18:58,210 --> 03:19:00,910
the British who are using the Canadians 
and Australians as we said,

3256
03:19:00,911 --> 03:19:05,911
as sort of shock armies,
use 500 plus tanks.

3257
03:19:06,070 --> 03:19:07,690
And most of them are the big heavy ones 
that,

3258
03:19:07,840 --> 03:19:12,840
that are like school buses.
And they have the aircraft come in and 

3259
03:19:12,840 --> 03:19:14,260
do the ground attack missions.
They have the infantry come out,

3260
03:19:14,261 --> 03:19:15,490
they use the,
the,

3261
03:19:15,491 --> 03:19:20,491
the wall of shelves,
but no preliminary bombardment and 

3262
03:19:20,491 --> 03:19:21,850
German units just break in front of 
them.

3263
03:19:23,170 --> 03:19:25,140
The French have success,
you know,

3264
03:19:25,150 --> 03:19:30,150
in theirs that they launch a couple of 
hours later and the allies are pushing 

3265
03:19:30,150 --> 03:19:34,891
through German lines and making what by 
first world war standards is great 

3266
03:19:35,711 --> 03:19:40,711
progress.
Here's how historian Nick Lloyd 

3267
03:19:40,711 --> 03:19:40,711
describes the day,
quote,

3268
03:19:40,711 --> 03:19:43,270
eighth August would be one of the most 
remarkable days of the war.

3269
03:19:43,510 --> 03:19:46,090
Although the position of all units was 
not known.

3270
03:19:46,270 --> 03:19:51,270
The ally to salted,
driven between six and eight miles into 

3271
03:19:51,270 --> 03:19:52,870
German lines,
shattering the second army and unhinging

3272
03:19:52,871 --> 03:19:57,640
the flank of the 18th army on its left 
German casualties had been staggering.

3273
03:19:57,910 --> 03:20:01,480
The official history estimated that they
were as high as 48,000

3274
03:20:01,481 --> 03:20:03,700
men,
including 33,000

3275
03:20:03,701 --> 03:20:08,701
missing or taken prisoner.
400 guns had been lost as well as 

3276
03:20:08,701 --> 03:20:12,931
hundreds of machine guns and trench 
mortars for the battalions in the front 

3277
03:20:12,931 --> 03:20:16,711
line.
Often only small groups of survivors 

3278
03:20:16,711 --> 03:20:16,711
remained.
He then continues,

3279
03:20:16,711 --> 03:20:21,391
quote,
numerous frontline battalions had been 

3280
03:20:21,391 --> 03:20:24,151
reduced to the size of companies.
All that remained were clusters of 

3281
03:20:24,151 --> 03:20:27,961
shellshocked.
Men there will utterly broken their 

3282
03:20:27,961 --> 03:20:28,240
faces,
grimy their eyes,

3283
03:20:28,270 --> 03:20:30,100
glassy,
staring straight ahead.

3284
03:20:30,310 --> 03:20:35,310
Their stories were always the same.
Horrifying accounts of iron monsters 

3285
03:20:35,310 --> 03:20:39,901
clinking out of the mists towards them 
of mass infantry attacks of being cut 

3286
03:20:39,901 --> 03:20:43,270
off and surrounded of waiting for 
counter attacks that never came.

3287
03:20:43,540 --> 03:20:48,540
Some did not,
or perhaps could not say anything at 

3288
03:20:48,540 --> 03:20:48,600
all.
Ludina doors,

3289
03:20:48,601 --> 03:20:53,601
worst nightmare was it seemed coming 
true and quote in his memoirs is very 

3290
03:20:57,011 --> 03:20:59,290
suspect and take it with a grain of salt
memoirs,

3291
03:20:59,830 --> 03:21:04,830
Ludin Dorf claims to have sent an 
observer to go and check out the scene 

3292
03:21:05,170 --> 03:21:08,500
where these units were breaking and he 
says,

3293
03:21:08,501 --> 03:21:13,501
the observer came back and said that the
troops at the front line were yelling at

3294
03:21:14,050 --> 03:21:16,690
the reserves as they came up to take 
their place.

3295
03:21:17,290 --> 03:21:22,290
Black legs strike breakers.
You're prolonging the war,

3296
03:21:23,170 --> 03:21:26,830
and Luton Dorf pointed out that there 
was no way to hide.

3297
03:21:26,831 --> 03:21:31,831
Now,
you know the changes in the fighting 

3298
03:21:31,831 --> 03:21:31,870
efficiency as he called it,
of the troops,

3299
03:21:32,110 --> 03:21:34,510
they become brittle.
You couldn't depend on some of them.

3300
03:21:35,580 --> 03:21:36,790
Ludina says,
of course,

3301
03:21:36,791 --> 03:21:38,110
that I warned you about this all the 
time.

3302
03:21:38,111 --> 03:21:42,040
It's the bolshevism taking hold.
He wanted to shoot more of them maybe as

3303
03:21:42,041 --> 03:21:46,940
a way to stiffen the defense,
but then he says that this convinced him

3304
03:21:46,941 --> 03:21:51,941
that the war had to be ended and then 
some history say that the Kaiser a day 

3305
03:21:52,791 --> 03:21:55,820
or two later comes to the conclusion 
after talking with them that the war had

3306
03:21:55,821 --> 03:21:58,820
to be ended and then other histories say
other things.

3307
03:21:58,821 --> 03:22:00,770
I mean,
I don't even know how to describe all of

3308
03:22:00,771 --> 03:22:05,771
the uncertainties as people try to 
figure out what really happened as 

3309
03:22:05,771 --> 03:22:06,920
opposed to what ended up in the history 
books.

3310
03:22:08,030 --> 03:22:13,030
There's a lot of evidence to suggest 
that Ludin Dorff was more of a hard 

3311
03:22:13,030 --> 03:22:16,100
liner and held out until much later,
but when you see how again,

3312
03:22:16,140 --> 03:22:21,140
the sacrifice that's going to be made 
because he may be drags his feet on 

3313
03:22:21,351 --> 03:22:23,030
peace negotiations,
for example.

3314
03:22:23,390 --> 03:22:25,520
That's a hard thing to justify after the
war.

3315
03:22:25,670 --> 03:22:28,940
If a decision like that costs an extra 
hundred or 200,000

3316
03:22:28,941 --> 03:22:33,941
casualties,
how do you look your countrymen in the 

3317
03:22:33,941 --> 03:22:33,941
eye 20,
30 years later?

3318
03:22:33,941 --> 03:22:36,510
Right.
I think if I were in Luton doors,

3319
03:22:36,590 --> 03:22:41,590
shoes,
I might try after the war to shade 

3320
03:22:41,590 --> 03:22:43,991
things in the best light to,
I mean one of the tragedies during this 

3321
03:22:43,991 --> 03:22:48,281
period,
there'll be a German general who is 

3322
03:22:48,281 --> 03:22:50,621
looking at the incoming list of 18 year 
olds and entire age group now being 

3323
03:22:50,901 --> 03:22:55,901
called up again to be thrown into the 
law of this war when it's already 

3324
03:22:55,901 --> 03:22:58,250
decided and he'll say too bad about the 
young blood.

3325
03:23:00,020 --> 03:23:05,020
If one of those members of that new crop
of young bloods was your son and you 

3326
03:23:05,020 --> 03:23:08,060
lost him in that war afterwards,
reading Luton,

3327
03:23:08,070 --> 03:23:10,520
Doris memoirs,
you might not be too pleased either.

3328
03:23:11,990 --> 03:23:16,990
Nonetheless,
after the black day of the German army 

3329
03:23:16,990 --> 03:23:19,901
on August eighth,
the allies will launch a series of 

3330
03:23:19,901 --> 03:23:23,780
regular hammer blows at the Germans and 
they're all pretty darn awful in between

3331
03:23:23,781 --> 03:23:26,210
them.
There's tons of fighting going on.

3332
03:23:26,211 --> 03:23:27,920
You know the taking of this machine gun 
nest,

3333
03:23:27,921 --> 03:23:32,921
the moving into this valley.
It's pretty much constant somewhere up 

3334
03:23:32,921 --> 03:23:32,921
and down,
the line,

3335
03:23:32,921 --> 03:23:37,361
pressure on the German army and the 
casualties because now we've reverted 

3336
03:23:37,361 --> 03:23:39,680
back to open warfare again.
People are not hiding in trenches,

3337
03:23:39,681 --> 03:23:44,681
which let's be honest,
are safer than being up above the 

3338
03:23:44,681 --> 03:23:48,341
trenches,
which is why you had trenches to begin 

3339
03:23:48,341 --> 03:23:50,591
with,
and the casualties just go through the 

3340
03:23:50,591 --> 03:23:52,691
roof again at a point in the war where 
really they're fighting for improved 

3341
03:23:55,370 --> 03:23:57,350
terms of an armistice,
right,

3342
03:23:57,360 --> 03:23:59,870
and Ludina doors not exactly moving all 
that fast.

3343
03:23:59,870 --> 03:24:03,380
Supposedly the Kaiser wants to open up 
negotiations with the Netherlands,

3344
03:24:03,650 --> 03:24:06,830
but it's not really taken off so fast 
and you're thinking in your head,

3345
03:24:06,831 --> 03:24:09,110
as you look back on this tragedy every 
day,

3346
03:24:09,590 --> 03:24:12,170
you know all these people dying.
You just want them to hurry rush.

3347
03:24:12,171 --> 03:24:13,460
There's a time limit here,
right?

3348
03:24:13,461 --> 03:24:16,460
Every day you get a little closer to 
armageddon.

3349
03:24:17,750 --> 03:24:22,750
Armageddon is exactly what historian 
Peter Hart called this period of the 

3350
03:24:22,750 --> 03:24:26,531
war,
the period after the black day of the 

3351
03:24:26,531 --> 03:24:26,531
German army,
August eighth,

3352
03:24:26,531 --> 03:24:28,940
when multiple punches keep knocking the 
Germans backward,

3353
03:24:28,941 --> 03:24:33,110
eventually knocking them back into those
prepared defenses that they had,

3354
03:24:33,430 --> 03:24:38,430
you know,
move forward from months ago and 

3355
03:24:38,430 --> 03:24:38,450
everybody takes up their positions again
and then the allies smashed through that

3356
03:24:39,560 --> 03:24:42,560
heart says quote,
the allied armies,

3357
03:24:42,740 --> 03:24:43,830
British,
French,

3358
03:24:43,890 --> 03:24:48,030
American and Belgian moved forward along
most of the western front.

3359
03:24:48,330 --> 03:24:49,600
They were winning.
All right,

3360
03:24:49,830 --> 03:24:54,830
but casualties were still high.
This was a truly murderous form of 

3361
03:24:54,830 --> 03:24:58,941
warfare.
It's a sobering statistic that of the 

3362
03:24:58,941 --> 03:25:01,641
one point 2 million men serving in the 
British expeditionary force between 

3363
03:25:02,130 --> 03:25:02,580
August and November,
19,

3364
03:25:02,581 --> 03:25:05,430
18,
some 360,000

3365
03:25:05,431 --> 03:25:08,610
of them became casualties.
This was unsustainable.

3366
03:25:08,790 --> 03:25:10,800
The B e,
F was being consumed.

3367
03:25:10,980 --> 03:25:12,930
The French and Americans were also 
suffering.

3368
03:25:12,931 --> 03:25:15,450
This was armageddon.
End Quote.

3369
03:25:17,240 --> 03:25:22,240
Again,
it reminds you of an almost tokenistic 

3370
03:25:22,240 --> 03:25:23,720
situation where the good guys,
even if they win,

3371
03:25:23,721 --> 03:25:25,940
are going to be a shadow of their former
selves,

3372
03:25:27,250 --> 03:25:32,250
but if it was bad for the allies who at 
least knew that they were going to win 

3373
03:25:32,250 --> 03:25:35,791
this situation,
think about what it was like for the 

3374
03:25:35,791 --> 03:25:38,131
people who are enduring with the 
knowledge that whatever they were 

3375
03:25:38,131 --> 03:25:41,770
fighting for is already a moot point.
Me In passing him writes,

3376
03:25:41,771 --> 03:25:45,190
quote,
most of the Kaisers men were now utterly

3377
03:25:45,191 --> 03:25:50,191
resigned to the prospect of defeat and 
despair that they fought on in places 

3378
03:25:50,191 --> 03:25:54,661
with such tenacity and in such good 
order and never ceases to impress an 

3379
03:25:54,661 --> 03:25:58,321
amaze.
Many that either witnessed it then or 

3380
03:25:58,321 --> 03:26:00,871
consider it today,
but it was also a truly awful 

3381
03:26:00,871 --> 03:26:03,961
experience.
Soldiers bemoaned their plight and he 

3382
03:26:03,961 --> 03:26:05,830
quotes a German soldier during these 
last hundred days of the war.

3383
03:26:06,660 --> 03:26:11,660
Our artillery is fired out.
We have too few horses are fresh troops 

3384
03:26:11,660 --> 03:26:16,411
are anemic.
Boys in need of rest who cannot carry a 

3385
03:26:16,411 --> 03:26:17,950
pack but merely know how to die by 
thousands.

3386
03:26:18,250 --> 03:26:23,250
They understand nothing about warfare.
They simply go and let themselves be 

3387
03:26:23,250 --> 03:26:27,151
shot down.
The summer of 1918 has been the most 

3388
03:26:27,151 --> 03:26:30,391
bloody and the most terrible.
Every man here knows we are losing the 

3389
03:26:30,391 --> 03:26:31,750
war still.
The campaign goes on,

3390
03:26:31,990 --> 03:26:34,750
the dying goes on,
and to quote

3391
03:26:36,310 --> 03:26:38,830
again,
that's another guy who might not want to

3392
03:26:38,831 --> 03:26:40,780
read Luton,
Doris Morris.

3393
03:26:40,781 --> 03:26:42,640
After the war,
after the war,

3394
03:26:42,641 --> 03:26:44,970
the great German historian,
military historian,

3395
03:26:44,980 --> 03:26:45,760
Hans Dell,
Brooke,

3396
03:26:45,761 --> 03:26:50,761
will be a scathing critique of Luton 
Dorff and with the same kind of rage 

3397
03:26:50,761 --> 03:26:55,111
that anyone might have from that 
generation and even that side of the 

3398
03:26:55,111 --> 03:26:58,861
war.
When you realize that maybe several 

3399
03:26:58,861 --> 03:26:59,350
hundred thousand casualties were 
unnecessary.

3400
03:27:00,760 --> 03:27:05,760
As we said,
the weird human emotion that comes into 

3401
03:27:05,760 --> 03:27:08,971
play though is that when you look at the
sacrifices and the endurance of these 

3402
03:27:08,971 --> 03:27:11,950
people,
you can't help but notice the heroism in

3403
03:27:11,951 --> 03:27:12,550
it,
right?

3404
03:27:12,590 --> 03:27:14,350
It's.
It's a strange thing,

3405
03:27:16,320 --> 03:27:19,440
Lloyd George knows that though the 
British prime minister in his memoirs in

3406
03:27:19,441 --> 03:27:24,441
a part that you can't really spin,
goes out of his way to just talk about 

3407
03:27:24,441 --> 03:27:27,570
how amazing the whole thing was.
He says,

3408
03:27:27,571 --> 03:27:32,571
quote,
the ceaseless body blows delivered with 

3409
03:27:32,571 --> 03:27:36,531
increasing power by the allied forces,
left the German army breathless and 

3410
03:27:36,531 --> 03:27:41,211
helpless,
but it is fair to acknowledge that they 

3411
03:27:41,211 --> 03:27:42,550
retreated fighting for every kilometer 
that they ultimately

3412
03:27:42,550 --> 03:27:46,540
had to concede.
It was not a chase and hardly a pursuit,

3413
03:27:46,780 --> 03:27:48,670
starved,
decimated,

3414
03:27:48,790 --> 03:27:53,790
despairing.
The German soldiers fought on making us 

3415
03:27:53,790 --> 03:27:57,481
pay a heavy price for every mile.
We wrestled from them throughout the 

3416
03:27:57,481 --> 03:28:01,171
whole war.
The Germans had shown themselves dowdy 

3417
03:28:01,171 --> 03:28:03,691
fighters,
but there was nothing finer in their 

3418
03:28:03,691 --> 03:28:06,031
record than the pluck with which they 
continue to withstand us in the hour of 

3419
03:28:06,031 --> 03:28:06,730
their defeat.
They could not,

3420
03:28:06,731 --> 03:28:10,420
but know that they were beaten at home.
Their families were starving.

3421
03:28:10,720 --> 03:28:14,110
Yet in the month of October,
the last whole month of the war,

3422
03:28:14,320 --> 03:28:17,400
the British forces in France suffered 
over 120,000

3423
03:28:17,410 --> 03:28:22,180
battle casualties as evidence of the 
resistance they encountered between July

3424
03:28:22,181 --> 03:28:27,181
first and the conclusion of hostilities,
the British battle casualties in 

3425
03:28:27,181 --> 03:28:30,991
fighting a beaten pho and a foe that 
knew he was beaten on every front 

3426
03:28:31,090 --> 03:28:36,090
totaled 430,000
killed wounded prisoners and missing 

3427
03:28:36,090 --> 03:28:39,700
during practically the same period.
The French lost 531,000

3428
03:28:39,701 --> 03:28:44,701
men and the Americans over 200,000
let us do honor to a brave people with 

3429
03:28:45,431 --> 03:28:47,830
whom we've had,
but one deadly quarrel.

3430
03:28:48,040 --> 03:28:53,040
They fought to the end with desperate 
valor and quote American historian Scott

3431
03:28:55,590 --> 03:29:00,590
Stevenson wrote quote to be a German 
defender in the path of a major allied 

3432
03:29:01,021 --> 03:29:05,940
attack late in the war was to experience
the horrors of Dante's inferno

3433
03:29:07,360 --> 03:29:11,200
and quote and truthfully,
when you read the stories,

3434
03:29:11,830 --> 03:29:14,860
they sound like they could come from any
part of this nightmare.

3435
03:29:15,700 --> 03:29:20,050
The worst tragedy here is that you get 
the feeling like all of this is,

3436
03:29:20,700 --> 03:29:23,020
you know,
coming after the time when this conflict

3437
03:29:23,021 --> 03:29:27,010
should be ended already.
If the whole thing is already tragic.

3438
03:29:27,011 --> 03:29:28,690
This is the extra tragic part.

3439
03:29:30,110 --> 03:29:33,980
Historian Nick Lloyd talks about a 
German gunner named Ernst Keel.

3440
03:29:33,981 --> 03:29:38,981
Meyer who recorded in his diary about 
the fighting going on in late September,

3441
03:29:39,141 --> 03:29:42,380
early October.
He writes about his experience of coming

3442
03:29:42,381 --> 03:29:45,380
under sustained British artillery 
bombardment,

3443
03:29:45,381 --> 03:29:50,381
including a direct hit.
He talks about three men and says that 

3444
03:29:50,381 --> 03:29:52,730
they were quote torn apart beyond 
recognition.

3445
03:29:53,340 --> 03:29:54,770
And then he said,
oh Lord,

3446
03:29:54,771 --> 03:29:56,840
what a Monday morning and said,
quote,

3447
03:29:57,110 --> 03:30:00,830
I'm firing on gun number four all day in
between,

3448
03:30:00,831 --> 03:30:04,400
we picked up the pieces of bone and 
flesh and put them in a box.

3449
03:30:04,640 --> 03:30:09,640
I'm mark them with a red pencil,
my companion at all times so that the 

3450
03:30:09,640 --> 03:30:13,691
cemetery official will know as their 
metal plates with names and ranks could 

3451
03:30:13,691 --> 03:30:15,830
not be found.
Try to pick up three heads,

3452
03:30:15,950 --> 03:30:20,690
six arms and feet and whatever else 
there is left from your friends then.

3453
03:30:20,790 --> 03:30:23,330
And the historian Nick Lloyd Wright's 
quote,

3454
03:30:23,990 --> 03:30:28,990
Keel.
Meyer was understandably traumatized by 

3455
03:30:28,990 --> 03:30:28,990
his experiences.
Quote,

3456
03:30:29,180 --> 03:30:31,580
if that's how three of us die,
he wrote,

3457
03:30:31,790 --> 03:30:34,010
I hope their families will never find 
out.

3458
03:30:34,400 --> 03:30:35,150
And to quote,

3459
03:30:37,070 --> 03:30:39,530
and again,
as we've done it earlier in this piece,

3460
03:30:39,531 --> 03:30:44,531
I want to emphasize that these are the 
survivors who go home and make the post 

3461
03:30:46,341 --> 03:30:50,630
first world war world,
the user water in their memory banks.

3462
03:30:50,660 --> 03:30:55,660
These are what they carry with them.
These are what influenced their 

3463
03:30:55,660 --> 03:30:55,820
politics,
their standards,

3464
03:30:56,060 --> 03:30:59,900
their expectations and influences what 
they want.

3465
03:31:00,410 --> 03:31:05,410
The bitterness.
That is part of of what odd off Hitler 

3466
03:31:05,410 --> 03:31:07,190
is trying to touch in his audience,
reading his book,

3467
03:31:07,191 --> 03:31:12,191
mine comp is the sort of bitterness that
experiences like this generate and they 

3468
03:31:12,591 --> 03:31:15,680
do so in an entire generation after this
war,

3469
03:31:15,980 --> 03:31:19,670
the British and the French will also 
have their poets and they're writers and

3470
03:31:19,671 --> 03:31:24,671
they're thinkers and they're politics.
I mean when one wonders why they seem so

3471
03:31:24,771 --> 03:31:27,590
willing to do whatever it took before 
the Second World War,

3472
03:31:27,800 --> 03:31:30,830
even if it did involve what we call 
today appeasement,

3473
03:31:31,160 --> 03:31:36,160
look at what were in those people's 
memory banks doing all those 

3474
03:31:36,160 --> 03:31:40,511
negotiations.
The vast majority of the people that 

3475
03:31:40,511 --> 03:31:43,961
will be in decision making positions 
militarily and politically where people 

3476
03:31:43,961 --> 03:31:48,731
who were in the first world war.
I'm looking at what they went through 

3477
03:31:48,770 --> 03:31:50,180
and think of how it changed them

3478
03:31:52,140 --> 03:31:55,350
as autumn was beginning to turn to 
November in 1918.

3479
03:31:55,590 --> 03:32:00,590
Optimists,
we're beginning to think that this work 

3480
03:32:00,590 --> 03:32:00,590
could be won in 19,
19.

3481
03:32:00,590 --> 03:32:03,240
Pessimists still pointed out maybe 19,
20 was more realistic.

3482
03:32:03,540 --> 03:32:06,510
If the Germans began a step by step dog,
a defense,

3483
03:32:06,511 --> 03:32:08,070
they could hold out for a long time.

3484
03:32:09,650 --> 03:32:11,000
You know,
it's worth pointing out too because it's

3485
03:32:11,001 --> 03:32:16,001
kind of important that the Germans 
aren't on German soil yet they're 

3486
03:32:16,001 --> 03:32:18,971
retreating,
but they're still on conquered 

3487
03:32:18,971 --> 03:32:20,831
territory.
Something that they will continually 

3488
03:32:20,831 --> 03:32:20,831
tell themselves was,
you know,

3489
03:32:20,831 --> 03:32:25,630
a a sign that they were never defeated 
and something politicians after the war 

3490
03:32:25,630 --> 03:32:30,311
will play up to write the never defeated
German army always on conquered 

3491
03:32:30,311 --> 03:32:33,731
territory,
but they're being battered pillar to 

3492
03:32:33,731 --> 03:32:33,731
post during this last hundred days 
offensive.

3493
03:32:34,700 --> 03:32:37,730
They will retreat at one point to the 
old Hindenburg line.

3494
03:32:37,731 --> 03:32:39,920
These great defenses are going to make a
stand.

3495
03:32:39,921 --> 03:32:44,921
They'll never break the Hindenburg line 
and an American and French forces 

3496
03:32:44,921 --> 03:32:47,981
breakthrough the Hindenburg line.
Ironically though,

3497
03:32:48,771 --> 03:32:53,771
considering all of the debates the 
allied commanders and politicians had 

3498
03:32:53,771 --> 03:32:55,370
been having for years,
the eastern or Western or debate,

3499
03:32:55,371 --> 03:32:57,080
where do you put the troops?
Where do you win the war?

3500
03:32:57,081 --> 03:33:02,081
Western front or someplace else.
It's someplace else that collapses 

3501
03:33:02,081 --> 03:33:02,081
first.

3502
03:33:03,020 --> 03:33:05,780
In this case,
it's what's called the Balkan front,

3503
03:33:05,781 --> 03:33:09,890
and for years the allies had been slowly
but surely building up forces in a place

3504
03:33:09,891 --> 03:33:12,380
called Salonika in Greece and doing 
nothing with the.

3505
03:33:12,381 --> 03:33:17,381
Mainly the British especially joked that
they were the gardeners of Salonica 

3506
03:33:18,450 --> 03:33:22,130
because they were just sitting around.
A Greek army eventually joins the French

3507
03:33:22,131 --> 03:33:24,850
and British army that's there,
the army of Serbia.

3508
03:33:24,860 --> 03:33:29,860
Remember Serbia has been conquered,
taken over out of the war now for a 

3509
03:33:29,860 --> 03:33:30,230
couple of years,
but their army fled with the king at the

3510
03:33:30,231 --> 03:33:33,320
head and they've been reconstituted here
at Salonica,

3511
03:33:33,710 --> 03:33:38,710
but more people are dying from malaria 
there than any military fighting and 

3512
03:33:38,710 --> 03:33:38,710
then all of

3513
03:33:38,710 --> 03:33:39,750
a sudden in September 19,
18,

3514
03:33:40,020 --> 03:33:44,970
the allies strike there against a bunch 
of Bulgarians who are poorly supplied,

3515
03:33:44,971 --> 03:33:49,971
poorly motivated,
and certainly not ready to be hit by 

3516
03:33:49,971 --> 03:33:52,701
what is now more than 400,000
allied troops and they collapse.

3517
03:33:54,470 --> 03:33:59,470
This imperils everything.
And it's funny because if you read the 

3518
03:33:59,470 --> 03:34:02,751
Western history is written by the 
British and the French and the 

3519
03:34:02,751 --> 03:34:02,751
Americans,
it's clear that to them,

3520
03:34:02,751 --> 03:34:05,760
this is a side show thing.
It barely gets a mention sometimes,

3521
03:34:06,030 --> 03:34:09,810
but if you read German accounts,
this is a catastrophe.

3522
03:34:10,260 --> 03:34:13,290
They get their oil,
a lot of their food from this area.

3523
03:34:13,980 --> 03:34:18,980
This will certainly be the last car for 
the ostrow Hungarians who are teetering 

3524
03:34:18,980 --> 03:34:22,650
anyway because this is right by them.
The Ottoman Empire,

3525
03:34:22,850 --> 03:34:25,020
you know is one second away from 
collapsing too.

3526
03:34:25,260 --> 03:34:30,260
This is sort of a final straw,
but it's when Bulgaria drops out of the 

3527
03:34:30,260 --> 03:34:34,020
war and September 29th,
that Luton door finally breaks down.

3528
03:34:34,860 --> 03:34:35,520
No ifs,
ands,

3529
03:34:35,521 --> 03:34:40,521
or buts about it.
He goes to the Kaiser and says that the 

3530
03:34:40,521 --> 03:34:42,360
war must be ended right away.
We need in our midst us right now.

3531
03:34:42,420 --> 03:34:46,350
I can't guarantee that the army will be 
able to stand another 24 hours.

3532
03:34:47,400 --> 03:34:49,710
The German government contacts Woodrow 
Wilson,

3533
03:34:49,711 --> 03:34:51,960
hoping that they can get a nice deal 
from the Americans,

3534
03:34:51,961 --> 03:34:54,390
whereas the British and the French are 
not feeling very charitable.

3535
03:34:54,750 --> 03:34:59,750
Wilson still has,
has his idealistic 14 points out there 

3536
03:34:59,750 --> 03:35:00,120
and maybe the Germans can get that deal 
now.

3537
03:35:00,130 --> 03:35:05,130
Looks a lot better to them while they 
retreating than it did while they were 

3538
03:35:05,130 --> 03:35:05,130
advancing

3539
03:35:06,600 --> 03:35:10,770
and as German military historian,
Hans Dell Brooke Rights,

3540
03:35:10,771 --> 03:35:15,750
and this is the most painful event he's 
ever lived through,

3541
03:35:16,350 --> 03:35:21,350
and he writes this at the time to the 
German public and as the editor of the 

3542
03:35:21,631 --> 03:35:26,631
book points out,
this is something that would have been 

3543
03:35:26,631 --> 03:35:26,631
censored three weeks before he wrote it,
right?

3544
03:35:26,631 --> 03:35:29,080
It was so anti war or defeatist or 
whatever you want to say,

3545
03:35:29,081 --> 03:35:34,081
but now at this point in the war,
he's allowed to openly say something 

3546
03:35:34,081 --> 03:35:35,970
like this quote.

3547
03:35:37,210 --> 03:35:39,730
The same day I completed the previous 
volume,

3548
03:35:39,880 --> 03:35:42,610
the most terrible fate we feared 
overcame us.

3549
03:35:42,880 --> 03:35:46,030
Our Se front in the Balkans broke 
completely open.

3550
03:35:46,240 --> 03:35:49,300
The Bulgarians were defeated,
their king abdicated,

3551
03:35:49,420 --> 03:35:51,520
and the army of the entente that it's so
long.

3552
03:35:51,521 --> 03:35:55,960
Defendant Salonica was on the march to 
the Danube River in Syria.

3553
03:35:55,961 --> 03:36:00,961
The English not only fought but 
destroyed a Turkish army and took 

3554
03:36:00,961 --> 03:36:04,351
Damascus in Constantinople.
The German allied Turkish government of 

3555
03:36:04,351 --> 03:36:08,461
ever Talmud is gone.
It will not be long before the English 

3556
03:36:08,461 --> 03:36:09,790
fleet has free access to the Black Sea.
Austria,

3557
03:36:09,791 --> 03:36:13,270
Hungary is also in full disillusion on 
the western front.

3558
03:36:13,480 --> 03:36:18,480
Our hope that the enemy offensive would 
not pass through our siegfried line is 

3559
03:36:18,480 --> 03:36:20,860
unfulfilled under heavy losses of 
prisoners and material,

3560
03:36:21,010 --> 03:36:23,560
our army retreats from one place to 
another,

3561
03:36:23,770 --> 03:36:28,770
the superiority of our combined enemies,
not only in men but also in material 

3562
03:36:28,770 --> 03:36:33,630
airplanes,
tanks and munitions far exceeds 

3563
03:36:33,630 --> 03:36:36,061
expectations and calculations.
When we remember how strong we to the 

3564
03:36:36,061 --> 03:36:36,880
world this past spring

3565
03:36:37,030 --> 03:36:42,030
and our battlefield successes from the 
21st of March through June are sudden 

3566
03:36:42,030 --> 03:36:46,381
reverses hard to believe and quote on 
October 30th.

3567
03:36:46,931 --> 03:36:51,931
The Ottomans drop out of the war on 
November third.

3568
03:36:53,670 --> 03:36:58,100
The Austrians do.
While all this is going on,

3569
03:36:58,101 --> 03:37:03,101
you have this very weird almost month 
long period where negotiations are 

3570
03:37:03,261 --> 03:37:08,261
opening and going on behind the scenes 
and and everybody begins to get the 

3571
03:37:08,261 --> 03:37:09,560
impression that things are happening.
I mean the mood is quickening.

3572
03:37:09,561 --> 03:37:12,590
The war is,
is winding to some sort of a conclusion,

3573
03:37:12,591 --> 03:37:14,690
but people are still dying in mass 
numbers.

3574
03:37:16,370 --> 03:37:21,370
Some in the higher ups of the German 
navy decide that if the war is going to 

3575
03:37:21,370 --> 03:37:25,861
end like this,
the German navy is going to go out 

3576
03:37:25,861 --> 03:37:29,080
heroically and they come up with an idea
for an imperial navy death ride to 

3577
03:37:32,270 --> 03:37:37,270
Sally,
out with everything you have taken on 

3578
03:37:37,270 --> 03:37:39,881
the British fleet,
you know when a giant head to head 

3579
03:37:39,881 --> 03:37:40,580
battle and go down fighting and take as 
many of them with you as you can,

3580
03:37:42,050 --> 03:37:47,050
which sounds heroic and wonderful.
If you're some admiral somewhere when 

3581
03:37:47,050 --> 03:37:51,491
news that this is what's going on,
reaches the sailors in the fleet though 

3582
03:37:51,491 --> 03:37:53,240
who can also see that the war is winding
down.

3583
03:37:53,241 --> 03:37:55,280
Everybody's going to get to go home.
It's terrible,

3584
03:37:55,281 --> 03:38:00,281
but it's over,
and then they find out they get to be 

3585
03:38:00,281 --> 03:38:02,030
part of some death ride to save some 
honor for a fleet that isn't going to be

3586
03:38:02,031 --> 03:38:05,930
around whether the death ride happens or
not.

3587
03:38:05,960 --> 03:38:08,390
In a months time they say no

3588
03:38:09,830 --> 03:38:14,830
and they begin to rebel.
Riot is not too strong of a word.

3589
03:38:15,501 --> 03:38:19,010
First they have mutineers.
Mutineers are captured.

3590
03:38:19,370 --> 03:38:24,370
Then the rest of the fleets,
sailors get upset about the mutineers 

3591
03:38:24,370 --> 03:38:24,370
and long story short,
they end up,

3592
03:38:24,500 --> 03:38:25,700
you know,
running through the streets,

3593
03:38:25,730 --> 03:38:30,730
taking over the naval city of Keel,
and then they send out runners to other 

3594
03:38:31,311 --> 03:38:34,640
nearby cities and they begin to spread 
an idea,

3595
03:38:34,641 --> 03:38:39,641
not that dissimilar from ideas that were
being spread in Russia the year before.

3596
03:38:40,970 --> 03:38:45,830
Here is the fire from Luton,
Doris Neighbor's apartment,

3597
03:38:45,831 --> 03:38:47,810
finally taking flame in Germany

3598
03:38:49,220 --> 03:38:54,220
and there's been a lot of analysis as to
how Bolshevik oriented some of this is 

3599
03:38:54,220 --> 03:38:58,600
and the truth is most of it isn't.
The left in Germany runs the gamut from 

3600
03:38:58,600 --> 03:39:03,461
mild Social Democrats all the way to 
hardcore what are called spartacists and

3601
03:39:03,770 --> 03:39:08,770
everything in between and part of what 
will happen over the next six months in 

3602
03:39:08,770 --> 03:39:12,641
Germany will happen because there's no 
agreement on the left at all as to what 

3603
03:39:12,641 --> 03:39:15,440
should happen except that they're pretty
darn unified about one thing.

3604
03:39:15,830 --> 03:39:20,830
The war shouldn't happen anymore.
And as these people spread to other 

3605
03:39:20,830 --> 03:39:24,080
locations,
city after city goes revolutionary.

3606
03:39:25,490 --> 03:39:30,490
The great journalist Philip Gibbs who 
was with the allied entente armies as 

3607
03:39:30,490 --> 03:39:33,821
they,
as they battered the Germans back 

3608
03:39:33,821 --> 03:39:33,821
towards Germany,
you know,

3609
03:39:33,821 --> 03:39:33,980
thinks everything they've been

3610
03:39:33,980 --> 03:39:35,660
through through these years of war.
He writes,

3611
03:39:35,661 --> 03:39:39,080
quote,
the thought of all the losses on the way

3612
03:39:39,200 --> 03:39:43,190
and evolve the futility of this strife 
smoked at one's heart.

3613
03:39:43,640 --> 03:39:45,890
What fools the Germans had been?
What?

3614
03:39:45,891 --> 03:39:49,490
Tragic fools.
What a mad villainy there had been among

3615
03:39:49,491 --> 03:39:53,780
rival dynasties and powers and 
politicians and people's to lead to this

3616
03:39:53,781 --> 03:39:56,840
massacre.
What had one gained out of it all?

3617
03:39:57,080 --> 03:40:02,080
Nothing except ruin.
Nothing except great death and poverty 

3618
03:40:02,080 --> 03:40:05,750
and remorse and revolt and quote,
and as the German armies are collapsing,

3619
03:40:05,840 --> 03:40:08,480
gibbs points out that it's not a moment 
too soon.

3620
03:40:08,600 --> 03:40:09,320
He writes,
quote,

3621
03:40:10,160 --> 03:40:15,160
the British Army could not have gone 
much farther after November 11th when 

3622
03:40:15,160 --> 03:40:17,120
the our misdose brought us to a halt for
three months.

3623
03:40:17,121 --> 03:40:20,900
Our troops had fought incessantly 
storming many villages strongly.

3624
03:40:20,901 --> 03:40:24,680
Garrison with machine gunners crossing 
many canals under heavy fire,

3625
03:40:24,830 --> 03:40:29,270
losing many comrades all along the way.
The pace could not have been kept up.

3626
03:40:29,540 --> 03:40:32,000
There is a limit even to the valor of 
British troops.

3627
03:40:32,001 --> 03:40:33,680
And for a time we had reached that 
limit,

3628
03:40:34,310 --> 03:40:39,310
there were not many divisions who could 
have staggered onto new attacks without 

3629
03:40:39,310 --> 03:40:41,840
rest and relief.
He then goes on to talk about the French

3630
03:40:41,990 --> 03:40:45,160
and the Americans and then says quote 
before them,

3631
03:40:45,170 --> 03:40:50,170
the German troops were in revolt at last
against the bloody futile sacrifices of 

3632
03:40:50,901 --> 03:40:55,901
their manhood and people,
a blinding light had come to them 

3633
03:40:55,901 --> 03:40:59,620
revealing the criminality of their war 
lords in this great swindle against 

3634
03:40:59,620 --> 03:41:03,821
their race.
It was defeat and agony which 

3635
03:41:03,821 --> 03:41:06,731
enlightened them as most people,
even ourselves are enlightened only by 

3636
03:41:06,731 --> 03:41:08,870
suffering and disillusionment and never 
buy successes.

3637
03:41:09,680 --> 03:41:14,680
And quote,
if you read mine comp this moment in the

3638
03:41:15,321 --> 03:41:20,321
war is the crucible of Hitler's life.
And he says,

3639
03:41:20,571 --> 03:41:23,050
basically what Gibbs said,
you know,

3640
03:41:23,051 --> 03:41:28,051
when he finds out about what's going on,
he is recovering from a gas attack in 

3641
03:41:28,191 --> 03:41:33,191
the hospital and he finds out that this 
war is essentially winding down to in 

3642
03:41:33,341 --> 03:41:38,341
our misdose and the German government 
and the allies and especially Woodrow 

3643
03:41:38,341 --> 03:41:38,900
Wilson or negotiating back and forth as 
people die.

3644
03:41:39,020 --> 03:41:44,020
And Hitler freaks out.
And then he writes about it in mind 

3645
03:41:44,020 --> 03:41:48,000
comp.
In a way that is tactically brilliant,

3646
03:41:48,050 --> 03:41:53,050
I mean Hitler is a demagogue of the 
highest order and knows exactly what 

3647
03:41:53,301 --> 03:41:57,230
buttons to push in his audience and he 
knows that this audience,

3648
03:41:57,440 --> 03:41:58,370
you know,
10 years,

3649
03:41:58,460 --> 03:42:03,460
15 years after the war,
not even that long in some cases are 

3650
03:42:03,460 --> 03:42:07,880
still in shock and denial and disbelief 
and the bitterness that they're drowning

3651
03:42:07,881 --> 03:42:11,990
in thinking of what was lost and who 
they knew who was lost in the limbs that

3652
03:42:11,991 --> 03:42:14,180
they had lost and the lives that had 
changed.

3653
03:42:14,450 --> 03:42:19,450
He knew that those buttons were ripe for
exploiting and yet at the same time 

3654
03:42:20,181 --> 03:42:23,240
demagogue and manipulator though he was 
Hitler,

3655
03:42:23,241 --> 03:42:28,241
understood those buttons really well 
because those were actually the same 

3656
03:42:28,241 --> 03:42:31,590
buttons that he was so affected by.
He wrote this in mind comp and remember,

3657
03:42:31,591 --> 03:42:32,070
imagine

3658
03:42:32,070 --> 03:42:35,400
reading this as one of those people 
sitting there without an alarm.

3659
03:42:35,580 --> 03:42:40,580
Fifteen years after the war,
tortured by that experience still Hitler

3660
03:42:41,881 --> 03:42:42,540
says quote,

3661
03:42:43,600 --> 03:42:46,240
and so it had all been in vain,
in vain.

3662
03:42:46,241 --> 03:42:49,390
All the sacrifices and privations in 
vain.

3663
03:42:49,391 --> 03:42:53,680
The hunger and thirst of months,
which were often endless in vain.

3664
03:42:53,681 --> 03:42:56,770
The hours in which with mortal fear 
clutching our hearts,

3665
03:42:56,771 --> 03:43:01,771
we nevertheless did our duty and in vain
the deaths of two millions who died 

3666
03:43:01,771 --> 03:43:06,750
would not the graves of all the hundreds
of thousands open the graves of those 

3667
03:43:06,750 --> 03:43:08,860
who have faith in the fatherland had 
marched fourth,

3668
03:43:08,861 --> 03:43:13,861
never to return,
would they not open and send the silent 

3669
03:43:13,861 --> 03:43:17,731
mud and blood covered heroes back as 
spirits of vengeance to the homeland 

3670
03:43:17,731 --> 03:43:22,290
which had cheated them with such mockery
of the highest sacrifices which a man 

3671
03:43:22,290 --> 03:43:24,460
can make to his people in this world.
Had they died for this,

3672
03:43:24,730 --> 03:43:29,730
the soldiers of August and September 19,
14 was it for this in the autumn of the 

3673
03:43:30,520 --> 03:43:33,970
same year that the volunteer regiments 
marched out after their old comrades.

3674
03:43:34,210 --> 03:43:38,230
Was it for this that the boys have 17 
sank into the earth of flanders.

3675
03:43:38,620 --> 03:43:43,620
Was this the meaning of the sacrifice 
which the German mother made to the 

3676
03:43:43,620 --> 03:43:45,400
father,
land with sore heart as she let her best

3677
03:43:45,401 --> 03:43:48,430
love boys march off never to see them 
again.

3678
03:43:48,760 --> 03:43:53,110
Did all this happen only so that a gang 
of wretched criminals could lay hands on

3679
03:43:53,111 --> 03:43:53,850
the fatherland

3680
03:43:54,850 --> 03:43:59,840
end quote.
This bitterness was not just on the side

3681
03:43:59,841 --> 03:44:04,841
of the central powers who lost this war,
though corporate Louis Bar toss in the 

3682
03:44:04,841 --> 03:44:06,890
French army is,
if nothing else,

3683
03:44:06,950 --> 03:44:10,850
almost in sympathy with the German 
veterans.

3684
03:44:11,570 --> 03:44:14,450
Many of these people felt cheated by the
whole thing,

3685
03:44:14,660 --> 03:44:19,410
disillusioned by the whole thing,
exploited even barter.

3686
03:44:19,411 --> 03:44:24,411
Sounds like he feels more sympathy for 
his German enemy than he does for the 

3687
03:44:24,891 --> 03:44:29,891
people you know that in his mind anyway,
Bartos is a socialist and believes that 

3688
03:44:29,891 --> 03:44:31,760
the people running the world are kind of
the enemy.

3689
03:44:32,420 --> 03:44:33,170
He writes,
quote.

3690
03:44:33,800 --> 03:44:38,800
Meanwhile,
the great drama was reaching its 

3691
03:44:38,800 --> 03:44:40,430
conclusion alone against 20 nations 
baying after her Rena.

3692
03:44:40,431 --> 03:44:42,680
Fantastic clamor,
Germany,

3693
03:44:42,770 --> 03:44:47,140
so proud in 1914 now on its knees,
asked for mercy,

3694
03:44:47,330 --> 03:44:52,330
asked for armistice,
but this way of fleeing the war didn't 

3695
03:44:52,330 --> 03:44:54,860
appeal to the striped sleeves who didn't
have their fill of crosses.

3696
03:44:54,920 --> 03:44:56,030
Metals,
stars,

3697
03:44:56,031 --> 03:44:57,020
stripes,
ribbons,

3698
03:44:57,021 --> 03:44:59,330
honors and glories.
For these folks,

3699
03:44:59,450 --> 03:45:04,450
war had to end with total disaster.
For the German army against which Jenna 

3700
03:45:04,940 --> 03:45:07,040
Waterloo and sit down would be mere 
skirmishes.

3701
03:45:07,310 --> 03:45:12,310
Thousands of captured cannon.
Hundreds of thousands of captured 

3702
03:45:12,310 --> 03:45:16,100
bushes.
Shattered enemy forces streaming back 

3703
03:45:16,100 --> 03:45:18,521
across the Rhine,
bridges pursued with bayonets at their 

3704
03:45:18,521 --> 03:45:21,521
backs by our soldiers,
our regimens entering the great cities 

3705
03:45:21,521 --> 03:45:21,620
beyond the rhine,
flags,

3706
03:45:21,621 --> 03:45:26,621
fluttering bands playing here was the 
apotheosis dreamed of not only by our 

3707
03:45:26,621 --> 03:45:28,010
great warriors,
but by the government,

3708
03:45:28,100 --> 03:45:30,040
almost all the press,
almost all

3709
03:45:30,040 --> 03:45:31,630
the Embas,
gays and back in the rear.

3710
03:45:31,631 --> 03:45:36,631
All those who had nothing more to lose 
or who had more to gain by continuing 

3711
03:45:36,631 --> 03:45:37,990
the war.
What did a 100,000,

3712
03:45:38,110 --> 03:45:40,420
200,000
more cadavers matter,

3713
03:45:40,510 --> 03:45:43,450
a few more months of unimaginable 
suffering to bear.

3714
03:45:44,350 --> 03:45:47,440
Did that matter for those who were far 
from the slug fest,

3715
03:45:48,310 --> 03:45:50,590
he says,
and to accomplish this monstrous dream,

3716
03:45:50,591 --> 03:45:55,591
the so called allied government sought 
to delay for as long as possible the 

3717
03:45:55,591 --> 03:45:59,881
hour of the last cannon shot by 
requiring Germany to repeat its demands 

3718
03:45:59,881 --> 03:46:03,460
for our Mr several times for simple 
questions of form and formulas.

3719
03:46:04,060 --> 03:46:07,030
He says during that time in an orgy of 
murder,

3720
03:46:07,031 --> 03:46:12,031
bloodletting and burning the whole front
was in flames from eap to bell for 

3721
03:46:12,031 --> 03:46:16,081
without exception.
All the regimens were thrown into the 

3722
03:46:16,081 --> 03:46:17,310
assault on the German machine guns.
He says,

3723
03:46:17,311 --> 03:46:22,311
the German army's been back on all the 
points of contact without letting their 

3724
03:46:22,311 --> 03:46:25,170
line be broken and their retreat didn't 
turn into a rout and quote

3725
03:46:26,790 --> 03:46:31,790
what you hear.
There is admiration from a soldier to a 

3726
03:46:31,790 --> 03:46:35,721
soldier and sort of a shared 
understanding that when it came right 

3727
03:46:35,721 --> 03:46:38,910
down to it,
you know truces could be called and they

3728
03:46:38,911 --> 03:46:42,660
could go in the middle of no man's land 
and share tobacco in chocolate with each

3729
03:46:42,661 --> 03:46:47,661
other,
but the people that has bartos had said 

3730
03:46:47,661 --> 03:46:50,640
earlier in the work force them to fight 
each other against their will,

3731
03:46:51,020 --> 03:46:55,470
would continue the conflict until things
were just the way they wanted and people

3732
03:46:55,471 --> 03:47:00,471
will die until the absolute last minute 
of this conflict.

3733
03:47:01,231 --> 03:47:03,870
In fact,
they will die for decades afterwards.

3734
03:47:05,100 --> 03:47:10,100
The Germans will finally work out a deal
with Woodrow Wilson and the allies and 

3735
03:47:10,100 --> 03:47:14,271
the entente.
They have to get rid of their form of 

3736
03:47:14,271 --> 03:47:14,850
government and transitioned to a 
republic Ludin.

3737
03:47:14,851 --> 03:47:19,710
Dorf offers his resignation at the last 
couple of days of October.

3738
03:47:19,711 --> 03:47:24,711
It's accepted.
He dons a disguise and flees the 

3739
03:47:24,711 --> 03:47:24,711
country.

3740
03:47:24,711 --> 03:47:29,090
The Kaiser is told that he has to 
abdicate to save lives in the end,

3741
03:47:29,131 --> 03:47:30,780
the war,
and he tries not to,

3742
03:47:31,440 --> 03:47:36,440
but it's kind of he says stabbed in the 
back too and kind of forced to and and 

3743
03:47:36,440 --> 03:47:37,920
he flees to the Netherlands and now this
new German government,

3744
03:47:37,921 --> 03:47:42,921
which has been sort of left behind as a 
land mine by guys like Ludendorff 

3745
03:47:43,310 --> 03:47:44,910
Ludendorff famously said,
again,

3746
03:47:44,911 --> 03:47:47,100
blaming the socialist and the people 
back home.

3747
03:47:47,220 --> 03:47:49,560
You know that they did this stab in the 
back.

3748
03:47:49,561 --> 03:47:54,561
So let them pick up the pieces and let 
them get blamed by signing all the 

3749
03:47:54,561 --> 03:47:58,131
surrender and our Mr papers and that's 
kind of the way Ludina started spinning 

3750
03:47:58,131 --> 03:48:02,841
this whole thing from minute one.
Hitler picked up on that and entire 

3751
03:48:02,841 --> 03:48:07,131
German political movement will play off 
this idea that these people who signed 

3752
03:48:07,531 --> 03:48:10,380
the peace agreement,
the traders of November,

3753
03:48:10,980 --> 03:48:15,980
were the ones who lost the war and that 
it was never lost at the front by the 

3754
03:48:15,980 --> 03:48:15,990
soldiers.

3755
03:48:16,290 --> 03:48:21,290
This will set the stage for the next 
conflict and when the actual peace 

3756
03:48:22,141 --> 03:48:23,670
agreement is signed,
sealed,

3757
03:48:23,671 --> 03:48:25,890
and delivered,
which won't happen for quite a while.

3758
03:48:25,891 --> 03:48:27,890
There'll be long negotiations,
19,

3759
03:48:27,891 --> 03:48:32,891
19.
The results are so punitive that people 

3760
03:48:33,531 --> 03:48:38,531
will realize,
forward thinkers will realize and will 

3761
03:48:38,531 --> 03:48:41,081
say at the time that this does nothing 
but delay the decision and that they 

3762
03:48:42,241 --> 03:48:47,241
will be so many embittered elements 
after this treaty assigned the one that 

3763
03:48:47,241 --> 03:48:49,610
will actually end the first world war.
It will be a series of treaties actually

3764
03:48:50,120 --> 03:48:53,690
that you're guaranteeing another world 
war in the near future,

3765
03:48:54,980 --> 03:48:59,120
yet one can't help but think of all the 
men in uniform,

3766
03:48:59,121 --> 03:49:04,121
especially those in combat units at the 
front who were just glad that they were 

3767
03:49:05,271 --> 03:49:10,271
going to have a future and at the 11th 
hour of the 11th Day of the 11th month,

3768
03:49:14,360 --> 03:49:15,080
11:00
AM,

3769
03:49:15,081 --> 03:49:16,880
November 11th,
19,

3770
03:49:17,150 --> 03:49:22,150
18 on many different fronts,
soldiers greeted this moment,

3771
03:49:25,581 --> 03:49:26,810
this agreed moment.

3772
03:49:26,810 --> 03:49:29,930
It's a little strange when the war would
end in advance.

3773
03:49:31,460 --> 03:49:33,260
Historian,
soldier and politician,

3774
03:49:33,261 --> 03:49:35,630
John Buchan was there at one part of the
front.

3775
03:49:35,810 --> 03:49:38,830
The minute the war ended.
Here's what he wrote,

3776
03:49:39,800 --> 03:49:44,800
quote at two minutes to 11 opposite the 
South African Brigade at the eastern 

3777
03:49:45,711 --> 03:49:47,840
most point reached by the British 
army's,

3778
03:49:48,170 --> 03:49:52,340
a German machine gunner after firing off
a belt without a pause,

3779
03:49:52,580 --> 03:49:55,340
was seeing to stand up,
take off his helmet,

3780
03:49:55,580 --> 03:49:58,430
bow,
and then walk slowly to the rear.

3781
03:49:58,700 --> 03:50:03,700
There came a second of expect in silence
and then a curious rippling sound which 

3782
03:50:03,951 --> 03:50:08,180
observers far behind the front likened 
to the noise of a light wind.

3783
03:50:08,720 --> 03:50:13,720
It was the sound of men cheering from 
the voltage to the sea and quote,

3784
03:50:16,160 --> 03:50:21,160
the future may have been poisoned,
but at least these people would be there

3785
03:50:21,261 --> 03:50:26,261
to see it.
November 11th will be celebrated after 

3786
03:50:26,261 --> 03:50:31,181
the war has armistice day and will be 
celebrated with a wide mix and range of 

3787
03:50:32,361 --> 03:50:35,480
emotions.
The war,

3788
03:50:35,481 --> 03:50:39,470
however,
had taken the geo political chess map of

3789
03:50:39,471 --> 03:50:44,471
the world that had been basically in 
place since Napoleon's defeat 100 years 

3790
03:50:44,471 --> 03:50:46,250
before and throw it up in the air

3791
03:50:48,100 --> 03:50:53,100
and as the pieces fell back down to 
earth and people tried to reconstruct a 

3792
03:50:54,221 --> 03:50:57,970
new world really because countries had 
been totally removed from the map.

3793
03:50:58,810 --> 03:51:03,810
A lot of people were going to suffer.
Part of the reason that the first world 

3794
03:51:03,810 --> 03:51:08,761
war is so important to our modern time 
is that it's a little like a giant 

3795
03:51:09,971 --> 03:51:12,670
bundle of firecrackers that when you 
light it off,

3796
03:51:13,030 --> 03:51:18,030
nice big chunks of firecrackers blow off
in the distance and continue to explode 

3797
03:51:18,030 --> 03:51:19,180
sometimes with more violence than the 
original.

3798
03:51:19,181 --> 03:51:20,830
I mean that's what the Second World War 
is,

3799
03:51:20,831 --> 03:51:25,831
right at direct successor Bolshevism and
which leads to the Cold War.

3800
03:51:27,060 --> 03:51:32,060
The situation in the Middle East and the
oil and the colonial impact.

3801
03:51:33,660 --> 03:51:37,950
The thing about the first world war is 
that it wasn't quite armageddon yet.

3802
03:51:38,820 --> 03:51:43,820
The very things that probably were 
needed to create an absolute global 

3803
03:51:44,041 --> 03:51:47,190
holocaust hadn't yet entered into the 
picture.

3804
03:51:47,191 --> 03:51:52,191
Things like nuclear weapons for example,
but I think you can safely say looking 

3805
03:51:52,191 --> 03:51:56,331
at it that what the first world war was 
was a blueprint for Armageddon.

3806
03:52:04,690 --> 03:52:09,690
If this were a book,
this would sort of be the postscript 

3807
03:52:09,690 --> 03:52:12,480
section I guess,
but one of the most interesting aspects 

3808
03:52:12,480 --> 03:52:15,820
of the first world war is what came 
right afterwards,

3809
03:52:15,821 --> 03:52:18,430
sort of as a result of it.
It changed so much,

3810
03:52:18,580 --> 03:52:20,950
so the catalyst for change itself is 
interesting,

3811
03:52:21,160 --> 03:52:23,260
but the change,
it ushered in this fascinating

3812
03:52:24,860 --> 03:52:28,760
start with the fact that all of a sudden
the the map of Europe,

3813
03:52:28,761 --> 03:52:31,940
the Great Geo political chess board that
had existed forever,

3814
03:52:31,941 --> 03:52:36,941
was thrown up in the air,
totally scattered and all of a sudden 

3815
03:52:36,941 --> 03:52:38,200
pieces fell down that hadn't existed.
You know,

3816
03:52:38,310 --> 03:52:39,460
in a long time.
All of a sudden,

3817
03:52:39,470 --> 03:52:44,470
Poland was back.
There hadn't been a Poland for quite 

3818
03:52:44,470 --> 03:52:46,931
some time.
All of a sudden there was going to be 

3819
03:52:46,931 --> 03:52:46,931
like a checklist.
Slovakia.

3820
03:52:46,931 --> 03:52:48,470
I mean,
these are places that used to be part of

3821
03:52:48,471 --> 03:52:53,471
larger empires,
but those empires were smashed by this 

3822
03:52:53,471 --> 03:52:53,471
war.
Austria,

3823
03:52:53,471 --> 03:52:54,350
Hungary alone.
When you break that up,

3824
03:52:54,351 --> 03:52:59,351
you get a bunch of new countries,
you break the Ottoman Empire up,

3825
03:52:59,541 --> 03:53:01,250
you get the modern Middle East,

3826
03:53:02,970 --> 03:53:07,970
you break Germany up and you get the 
arguments for the Second World War,

3827
03:53:09,181 --> 03:53:14,181
right?
You get dancing and you get the sudeten 

3828
03:53:14,181 --> 03:53:16,540
land and what's also a parent at the end
of the first world war is you get this 

3829
03:53:17,461 --> 03:53:22,260
period of people who are trying to play 
the game the way it's always been played

3830
03:53:22,261 --> 03:53:23,850
in.
Maybe you could make an argument,

3831
03:53:23,851 --> 03:53:28,680
always will be played,
and people who are trying to utilize the

3832
03:53:28,681 --> 03:53:30,990
flip side of bitterness,
I guess you could say,

3833
03:53:30,991 --> 03:53:35,991
to create a better world.
We talked earlier about Woodrow Wilson 

3834
03:53:35,991 --> 03:53:39,531
and his idealism or fake idealism 
depends on which woodrow Wilson you buy 

3835
03:53:39,531 --> 03:53:40,590
into,
but nonetheless,

3836
03:53:40,920 --> 03:53:45,660
when you sell a war on the idea that it 
is a war to end all wars,

3837
03:53:46,140 --> 03:53:51,140
sometimes that becomes powerful hype 
that you have to at least make a good 

3838
03:53:51,140 --> 03:53:53,460
argument around if you want to play 
things the old fashioned way.

3839
03:53:54,210 --> 03:53:55,740
The British and the French,
for example,

3840
03:53:57,000 --> 03:54:02,000
make out like winners in the war when it
comes to the territory that they 

3841
03:54:03,331 --> 03:54:05,610
acquired.
When when the Ottoman Empire broke up,

3842
03:54:05,790 --> 03:54:09,540
all those new countries didn't really 
get full independence.

3843
03:54:09,541 --> 03:54:12,330
Most of them had a sort of a compromise 
sovereignty.

3844
03:54:12,331 --> 03:54:16,620
Is that a good way to put it with the 
French or the British Empire in charge,

3845
03:54:17,760 --> 03:54:20,790
that 20th century version of coal thing 
oil.

3846
03:54:21,270 --> 03:54:24,760
The British will miraculously ended up 
with a ton of it,

3847
03:54:26,400 --> 03:54:31,400
but the Americans and others had pushed 
ideas like self determination and the 

3848
03:54:31,400 --> 03:54:33,030
British had sorta mild that too,
and they kind of believed it too.

3849
03:54:33,031 --> 03:54:38,031
I mean it's.
It's one of those things where as the 

3850
03:54:38,031 --> 03:54:40,730
prime minister had said,
he kind of would have been remiss if he 

3851
03:54:40,730 --> 03:54:40,980
didn't grab some of that area,
just let the French habit.

3852
03:54:41,010 --> 03:54:43,230
Nonetheless,
they all kind of realized it didn't look

3853
03:54:43,231 --> 03:54:45,210
that great with a new set of values in 
play,

3854
03:54:45,510 --> 03:54:50,510
but self-determination became this weird
thing to know who deserves their own 

3855
03:54:50,551 --> 03:54:54,090
place and and how can you use self 
determination as a weapon.

3856
03:54:54,091 --> 03:54:59,091
Hitler would use it against one of those
territories that was created out of 

3857
03:54:59,091 --> 03:55:01,290
whole cloth by the World War One peace 
agreements place called checklist.

3858
03:55:01,291 --> 03:55:06,291
Slovakia within that place was a 
territory that had a majority of 

3859
03:55:06,291 --> 03:55:10,311
Germans.
It was called the sudeten land and 

3860
03:55:10,311 --> 03:55:13,320
Hitler would turn the arguments of 
idealism and self determination on their

3861
03:55:13,321 --> 03:55:14,190
head when you said,
hey,

3862
03:55:14,191 --> 03:55:16,200
if self determination is what you really
believe in,

3863
03:55:16,380 --> 03:55:21,380
those Germans in the sudeten land should
be allowed to come back to Germany and 

3864
03:55:21,380 --> 03:55:21,480
bring their land with them.

3865
03:55:23,030 --> 03:55:26,450
This would turn out to be a big problem 
and what are called the interwar years.

3866
03:55:26,690 --> 03:55:31,100
It would hamstring an entity that was 
truly idealistic,

3867
03:55:31,160 --> 03:55:36,160
like the League of nations setup after 
the first world war by the people who 

3868
03:55:36,160 --> 03:55:37,610
were,
as I said on the flip side,

3869
03:55:37,611 --> 03:55:41,270
sort of have the global bipolar mood.
Instead of being bitter.

3870
03:55:41,450 --> 03:55:44,930
Their attitude about the first world war
was a sort of a never again,

3871
03:55:45,260 --> 03:55:49,820
out of food and things like the League 
of nations and collective security.

3872
03:55:50,000 --> 03:55:55,000
We're going to ensure that the world 
never had a tragedy like that happen 

3873
03:55:55,000 --> 03:55:58,571
again.
We emphasize the bitterness at the end 

3874
03:55:58,571 --> 03:56:00,200
of the last program because the 
bitterness helps play into the next war,

3875
03:56:00,530 --> 03:56:05,530
but there were a lot of people that 
weren't bitter and it's only fair to 

3876
03:56:05,530 --> 03:56:05,530
point that out.
First of all,

3877
03:56:05,530 --> 03:56:07,460
you had people,
a lot of times these were officers too.

3878
03:56:07,461 --> 03:56:12,461
It's interesting to note who were so 
proud of their war service and what 

3879
03:56:12,461 --> 03:56:13,220
happened and and justifiably so.

3880
03:56:13,220 --> 03:56:17,210
Look what these people endured wouldn't 
take anything away from anyone.

3881
03:56:17,450 --> 03:56:20,390
Some people straight up enjoy the 
experience.

3882
03:56:20,810 --> 03:56:25,810
Ernst Junger has a piece in his book 
where he does something that I think 

3883
03:56:25,810 --> 03:56:28,670
many people throughout history have done
when they're at giant historical events.

3884
03:56:28,671 --> 03:56:33,350
When you're at a great battle and you 
know you're watching history unfold,

3885
03:56:33,530 --> 03:56:38,530
sometimes there's a powerful feeling in 
that and especially when you think 

3886
03:56:38,530 --> 03:56:42,611
you're playing a part in it.
On the 50th anniversary of the Normandy 

3887
03:56:42,611 --> 03:56:42,800
landings,
a d day,

3888
03:56:42,801 --> 03:56:47,801
I remember there was a newspaper article
published by an army psychiatrist who 

3889
03:56:48,351 --> 03:56:53,351
was talking about these kinds of moments
in soldiers' lives and said that for 

3890
03:56:53,351 --> 03:56:58,010
many of the men you know who were at,
you know de day in the Second World War,

3891
03:56:58,250 --> 03:57:00,260
that was the greatest experience of 
their lives.

3892
03:57:00,261 --> 03:57:05,261
The greatest event they would take part 
in historian Neil Ferguson.

3893
03:57:05,411 --> 03:57:10,411
In his book,
the pity of war describes the 

3894
03:57:10,411 --> 03:57:13,951
remembrances of a couple of soldiers who
were probably representative of a whole 

3895
03:57:13,951 --> 03:57:17,260
lot of these soldiers,
one's a Canadian private talking about,

3896
03:57:17,660 --> 03:57:19,510
you know,
what the first world war was to him,

3897
03:57:19,511 --> 03:57:22,910
and he said it was quote the greatest 
adventure of my life,

3898
03:57:23,150 --> 03:57:28,150
the memories of which will remain with 
me for the remainder of my days and I 

3899
03:57:28,150 --> 03:57:29,690
would not have missed it for anything 
and quote.

3900
03:57:30,900 --> 03:57:35,900
It also had this sort of momentous 
feeling that was sometimes tough to in a

3901
03:57:37,111 --> 03:57:42,111
recapture and private life.
Ferguson also quoted another soldier 

3902
03:57:42,111 --> 03:57:42,480
that said,
quote,

3903
03:57:43,110 --> 03:57:47,840
everything that happened after the war 
was an anticlimax and to quote,

3904
03:57:49,000 --> 03:57:51,880
in some ways the war was enhance 
anticlimax.

3905
03:57:53,290 --> 03:57:58,290
So many people went to fight based on 
ideas like the war to end all wars and 

3906
03:57:59,561 --> 03:58:04,561
yet people who were rather far sighted,
but there were plenty of them before the

3907
03:58:04,931 --> 03:58:08,410
smoke had even cleared.
We're predicting the second world war.

3908
03:58:08,411 --> 03:58:11,620
I mean the general release Cmo of the 
allied on ton forces.

3909
03:58:11,621 --> 03:58:16,120
Ferdinand foshe had said when he saw the
Versailles peace treaty,

3910
03:58:16,121 --> 03:58:21,121
this is not peace.
This is a 20 year armistice and by the 

3911
03:58:21,121 --> 03:58:25,111
way was almost 20 years exactly 21.
It looked to the British and the French 

3912
03:58:26,501 --> 03:58:29,920
like they made out well with territories
that they were able to take over,

3913
03:58:30,520 --> 03:58:35,520
but they were both in terms of their 
great power status,

3914
03:58:36,220 --> 03:58:40,970
mortally wounded.
The eventual cost of this war especially

3915
03:58:40,971 --> 03:58:43,100
falls on Britain's shoulders more than 
any others.

3916
03:58:43,101 --> 03:58:48,101
They were sort of the banker of the 
allied side and they are still are or 

3917
03:58:48,101 --> 03:58:52,991
were recently.
I don't know if there are still 

3918
03:58:52,991 --> 03:58:54,401
outstanding loans,
but it was only in the last few months 

3919
03:58:54,401 --> 03:58:57,310
that they paid off one of the 
outstanding first world war debts that 

3920
03:58:57,310 --> 03:58:57,310
were still out there

3921
03:58:57,480 --> 03:59:02,480
as we had said in the show,
the the center of World Trade and 

3922
03:59:02,480 --> 03:59:05,781
banking transferred from London to New 
York during this conflict and as a 

3923
03:59:06,061 --> 03:59:11,061
result of the financial transfer of 
wealth from the old world to the new 

3924
03:59:11,061 --> 03:59:15,111
world that this conflict required as we 
had said about token.

3925
03:59:15,451 --> 03:59:17,370
This is,
this is the,

3926
03:59:17,930 --> 03:59:22,930
you know,
peoples of the free peoples of middle 

3927
03:59:22,930 --> 03:59:23,700
earth destroying themselves to take down
the dark Lord.

3928
03:59:23,701 --> 03:59:24,840
Right?
He's gone.

3929
03:59:25,110 --> 03:59:27,780
Imperial Germany's no threat to anyone 
anymore,

3930
03:59:28,290 --> 03:59:33,290
but France and Britain to name just two 
countries or me not even to go into 

3931
03:59:33,290 --> 03:59:37,611
Russia's backyard and mentioned them.
France and Britain will never quite be 

3932
03:59:37,611 --> 03:59:39,950
what they were,
the Russians.

3933
03:59:39,951 --> 03:59:42,680
Needless to say,
I'm aren't going to be what they are.

3934
03:59:42,681 --> 03:59:47,681
They're going to be living under a 
communist regime for decades.

3935
03:59:48,140 --> 03:59:53,140
The Tsar and his family in the middle of
1918 will be executed by the Bolsheviks.

3936
03:59:54,711 --> 03:59:57,200
Every last one of them and the cook,

3937
03:59:58,280 --> 04:00:02,810
the United States comes out of the war.
Well actually they're,

3938
04:00:02,811 --> 04:00:06,800
they're on the receiving end of all that
old world wealth for example,

3939
04:00:07,670 --> 04:00:12,670
but for Americans it was quite a change,
a change that had really started with 

3940
04:00:12,670 --> 04:00:14,180
the Spanish American war.
You know,

3941
04:00:14,181 --> 04:00:17,840
20 or so years before the first world 
war when the United States started going

3942
04:00:17,841 --> 04:00:21,120
abroad and involving themselves more 
overseas.

3943
04:00:21,121 --> 04:00:26,121
The first world war solidified that 
trend and even though after the war 

3944
04:00:26,121 --> 04:00:26,720
there would be this mood that,
you know,

3945
04:00:26,780 --> 04:00:29,640
we're not doing that again.
You could tell that it's.

3946
04:00:29,940 --> 04:00:34,940
It was sort of like virginity,
a barrier had been crossed and you 

3947
04:00:34,940 --> 04:00:36,810
really just couldn't go back to the way 
things were.

3948
04:00:36,811 --> 04:00:39,420
We'd find that out as Americans in the 
Second World War.

3949
04:00:41,870 --> 04:00:46,870
Americans also got to experience other 
things that would not be uncommon in 

3950
04:00:46,870 --> 04:00:50,831
Europe.
Things like sedition and espionage acts 

3951
04:00:50,831 --> 04:00:53,600
imposed by the Wilson Administration 
things to prevent criticism of the war,

3952
04:00:53,780 --> 04:00:58,780
antiwar activities,
criminalized laws that are still on the 

3953
04:00:58,780 --> 04:01:02,681
books and still used today that most 
people look back on and still think that

3954
04:01:02,871 --> 04:01:05,960
those were extreme overreaches of 
presidential authority.

3955
04:01:06,650 --> 04:01:08,180
Nonetheless,
you know,

3956
04:01:08,181 --> 04:01:10,550
it was the first world war and the 
threat was there.

3957
04:01:12,910 --> 04:01:14,650
Japan,
as I said,

3958
04:01:14,651 --> 04:01:19,651
it would be the United States or Japan 
that I would nominate for the big 

3959
04:01:19,651 --> 04:01:20,170
victories in these wars.
Japan had a relatively easy run of.

3960
04:01:20,171 --> 04:01:23,650
It took over anything that was over in 
their territory that was German and then

3961
04:01:23,651 --> 04:01:28,651
started moving in more to the Asian 
mainland already in charge of a lot of 

3962
04:01:28,651 --> 04:01:33,241
Korean folks.
They started taking over territory that 

3963
04:01:33,241 --> 04:01:36,091
would eventually morphed into what some 
historians now considered to be the 

3964
04:01:36,091 --> 04:01:37,870
really early stages of the Second World 
War.

3965
04:01:38,500 --> 04:01:41,830
Because by the time the second world war
breaks out,

3966
04:01:41,831 --> 04:01:46,831
the Japanese had been involved in 
fighting with the Chinese for years and 

3967
04:01:46,831 --> 04:01:50,550
some fighting with the Russians to 
Turkey will continue to have problems 

3968
04:01:50,550 --> 04:01:53,740
with violence and ethnic conflict and 
modernism.

3969
04:01:54,790 --> 04:01:56,660
The fighting will never really stop over
in,

3970
04:01:56,680 --> 04:02:01,570
in Anatolia,
and that country will continue to strive

3971
04:02:01,600 --> 04:02:05,590
towards a more a national state hood.
They'll go through a period,

3972
04:02:05,920 --> 04:02:07,570
uh,
under Kemal Ataturk,

3973
04:02:07,571 --> 04:02:08,990
Mustafa Kemal,
um,

3974
04:02:09,100 --> 04:02:10,780
that's important.
And their history.

3975
04:02:11,170 --> 04:02:16,170
They'll also have to begin to live down 
some of the things that were done during

3976
04:02:17,501 --> 04:02:20,380
the first world war and famously to 
Armenians,

3977
04:02:20,381 --> 04:02:23,380
but also to people like a Syrian 
Christians,

3978
04:02:23,620 --> 04:02:28,620
Greeks.
The Turks had an ethnic problem that 

3979
04:02:28,620 --> 04:02:31,000
they dealt with sometimes in a very 
heavy handed manner.

3980
04:02:31,810 --> 04:02:35,410
The Austro-hungarian is also had an 
ethnic problem.

3981
04:02:35,920 --> 04:02:40,920
They,
along with the Habsburg rulers that had 

3982
04:02:40,920 --> 04:02:42,580
been in power for centuries,
were wiped away as a result of this war.

3983
04:02:44,130 --> 04:02:49,130
And the idea of self determination that 
Hitler would be able to use about the 

3984
04:02:49,130 --> 04:02:54,090
sudeten land and whatnot would begin to 
raise ugly sort of questions in places 

3985
04:02:54,901 --> 04:02:59,901
like India controlled by the British.
But not necessarily because the Indians 

3986
04:03:00,031 --> 04:03:05,031
wanted it that way.
Trying to clean up after the war is one 

3987
04:03:07,981 --> 04:03:12,981
of the great efforts of modern times.
First you have the bodies to deal with,

3988
04:03:14,900 --> 04:03:19,900
then you have the damage to the.
And then you have the cleanup that 

3989
04:03:19,900 --> 04:03:21,460
happens,
you know,

3990
04:03:21,461 --> 04:03:26,461
in,
in the collective populations of all 

3991
04:03:26,461 --> 04:03:26,860
these countries,
the emotional cleanup,

3992
04:03:26,861 --> 04:03:28,610
if you will,
the getting past it.

3993
04:03:29,890 --> 04:03:34,890
All of these societies that were heavily
involved in the first world war will 

3994
04:03:34,890 --> 04:03:38,530
have a lot of disabled veterans around.
It will be a very visible reminder.

3995
04:03:38,770 --> 04:03:43,770
Nobody gets to just put this behind them
and walk away unscathed.

3996
04:03:45,600 --> 04:03:50,160
There's a story.
Adam hochschild in his book relates that

3997
04:03:50,161 --> 04:03:53,040
dates from the time of these last German
offensive,

3998
04:03:53,041 --> 04:03:55,080
you know,
the big last card being played.

3999
04:03:55,530 --> 04:04:00,530
That is a perfect example of what was 
going on in hundreds of thousands of 

4000
04:04:01,891 --> 04:04:02,550
homes.
I mean,

4001
04:04:02,551 --> 04:04:03,750
there's no question.
It was that many.

4002
04:04:03,751 --> 04:04:05,280
I'm just playing that number.
Safe

4003
04:04:06,700 --> 04:04:11,700
harsh child talks about these cards that
the officers would send to family 

4004
04:04:11,700 --> 04:04:16,030
members,
informing them that their child or loved

4005
04:04:16,031 --> 04:04:18,700
one was dead or missing.
And he says,

4006
04:04:18,701 --> 04:04:19,060
quote

4007
04:04:19,900 --> 04:04:24,900
cards float out in a ceaseless stream,
but when it came to Stephen Hog houses,

4008
04:04:25,091 --> 04:04:26,980
younger brother,
his parents,

4009
04:04:27,100 --> 04:04:32,100
like so many others,
simply received word that in the new 

4010
04:04:32,100 --> 04:04:33,710
German offensive,
the 23 year old Paul was quote,

4011
04:04:33,940 --> 04:04:36,580
missing presumed killed.
End Quote.

4012
04:04:37,240 --> 04:04:42,240
He had been seen fighting than falling.
When his units position was overrun 

4013
04:04:42,240 --> 04:04:46,950
several months later,
the family's hopes were raised when a 

4014
04:04:46,950 --> 04:04:49,621
fellow officer passed on a rumor that 
Paul was wounded and a prisoner in 

4015
04:04:49,621 --> 04:04:52,240
Germany with male going through contacts
in neutral countries.

4016
04:04:52,360 --> 04:04:55,120
Steven got in touch with a passivist 
committee in Berlin.

4017
04:04:55,320 --> 04:05:00,320
Quote,
I was very glad to be able to set on 

4018
04:05:00,320 --> 04:05:01,030
foot by this means in search for my 
brother Paul,

4019
04:05:01,150 --> 04:05:03,610
alas.
No trace of him could be found.

4020
04:05:03,820 --> 04:05:08,820
My poor mother for over six months 
persisted in the Fonda belief that Paul 

4021
04:05:08,820 --> 04:05:11,860
would return and quote hochschild 
continues.

4022
04:05:12,160 --> 04:05:17,160
During that time,
Margaret hobhouse never ceased to write 

4023
04:05:17,160 --> 04:05:18,010
letters to her son,
although they eventually came back,

4024
04:05:18,011 --> 04:05:21,340
marked undeliverable,
returned to sender.

4025
04:05:21,840 --> 04:05:25,590
Paul's body was never found and to 
quote,

4026
04:05:27,770 --> 04:05:32,000
but lots and lots of other peoples were.
And they're still being found.

4027
04:05:33,470 --> 04:05:38,470
You know,
you don't know how much of the really 

4028
04:05:38,470 --> 04:05:42,551
nasty stuff to get into on a program 
like this because you don't want to be 

4029
04:05:42,551 --> 04:05:45,140
gratuitous,
but what you do want to be able to do is

4030
04:05:45,141 --> 04:05:48,710
in your mind's eye,
see what these people are seeing,

4031
04:05:48,711 --> 04:05:49,700
right?
As we always say,

4032
04:05:49,701 --> 04:05:52,010
you can't experience or understand what 
they're going through,

4033
04:05:52,011 --> 04:05:56,480
but you can try to have the tiniest 
little bit of emotional sympathy,

4034
04:05:56,840 --> 04:06:01,840
but you kind of have to see things 
through their eyes and what they're 

4035
04:06:01,840 --> 04:06:04,661
seeing is permanently scarring.
The people who have to clean up after 

4036
04:06:04,671 --> 04:06:08,720
this war are sometimes as traumatized as
the people that have to fight it.

4037
04:06:09,800 --> 04:06:14,690
After these last big German offensives 
that that last story dealt with,

4038
04:06:15,350 --> 04:06:16,100
the boy missing

4039
04:06:16,100 --> 04:06:21,100
and presumed killed.
The people who were killed had to be 

4040
04:06:21,100 --> 04:06:24,170
picked up by somebody.
An American soldier named Robert Hoffman

4041
04:06:24,500 --> 04:06:29,500
in August 19,
18 was one of those somebody one day he 

4042
04:06:29,500 --> 04:06:32,660
writes quote,
did you ever smell a dead mouse?

4043
04:06:32,990 --> 04:06:37,990
That will give you about as much idea of
what a group of long dead soldiers 

4044
04:06:37,990 --> 04:06:41,981
smells like as will one grain of sand 
give you an idea of Atlantic city's 

4045
04:06:41,981 --> 04:06:44,780
beaches.
A group of men were sent to hill two,

4046
04:06:44,781 --> 04:06:45,230
oh,
four,

4047
04:06:45,231 --> 04:06:50,231
to make a reconnaissance to report on 
conditions there as well as to bury the 

4048
04:06:50,231 --> 04:06:52,010
dead.
The story was a very pathetic one.

4049
04:06:52,011 --> 04:06:55,430
He says the men were still lying there 
nearly two weeks later,

4050
04:06:55,431 --> 04:07:00,431
just as they'd fallen.
I knew all of these men intimately and 

4051
04:07:00,431 --> 04:07:01,640
it was indeed painful to learn of their 
condition.

4052
04:07:01,850 --> 04:07:06,850
Some had apparently lived for some time,
had tried to dress their own wounds or 

4053
04:07:06,850 --> 04:07:08,720
their comrades addressed them,
but later they died.

4054
04:07:08,720 --> 04:07:13,720
There I was especially pleased that the 
capture of the German soldiers had made 

4055
04:07:13,720 --> 04:07:15,650
it possible to bring back all the 
wounded in our sector.

4056
04:07:15,890 --> 04:07:20,890
Many of the men had been pumped full of 
machine gun bullets shot almost beyond 

4057
04:07:20,890 --> 04:07:22,130
recognition.
One hundred or so bullets,

4058
04:07:22,310 --> 04:07:24,800
even in a dead man's body is not a 
pretty sight.

4059
04:07:25,190 --> 04:07:27,830
One of our men was lying with a German 
bayonet through him.

4060
04:07:28,040 --> 04:07:33,040
Not unlike a pin through a large beetle.
Bayonets are hard to remove when once 

4061
04:07:33,040 --> 04:07:35,640
they've been caught between the ribs,
especially the Sawtooth Bay,

4062
04:07:35,641 --> 04:07:38,510
and that's many of the Germans carried 
to dislodge them.

4063
04:07:38,511 --> 04:07:41,660
It's usually necessary to shoot once or 
more to loosen the bay and net.

4064
04:07:42,020 --> 04:07:45,230
This German had not waited,
but left his gun and passed on.

4065
04:07:45,560 --> 04:07:48,290
The little Italian boy was lying on the 
barbed wire.

4066
04:07:48,470 --> 04:07:51,140
His eyes open and his helmet hanging 
back on his head.

4067
04:07:51,560 --> 04:07:56,560
There had been so much shrapnel that 
some of the bodies were torn beyond 

4068
04:07:56,560 --> 04:07:59,351
recognition.
This was the first experience at 

4069
04:07:59,351 --> 04:08:00,050
handling and burying the dead for many 
of our men.

4070
04:08:00,350 --> 04:08:03,980
It was a trying experience as I was to 
personally find somewhat later.

4071
04:08:05,390 --> 04:08:10,390
He then goes on to say there's nothing 
more pitiful than a battlefield after a 

4072
04:08:10,390 --> 04:08:10,390
battle.

4073
04:08:12,140 --> 04:08:12,860
Well,
pitiful.

4074
04:08:12,861 --> 04:08:13,460
Yes,

4075
04:08:14,900 --> 04:08:19,760
but dangerous is another term we might 
use because this cleanup is ongoing.

4076
04:08:19,761 --> 04:08:24,761
Even now,
there's a good side and a downside for 

4077
04:08:24,761 --> 04:08:26,930
the cleanup process with having a war 
that doesn't move.

4078
04:08:27,590 --> 04:08:31,460
The great mass of Europe and places 
elsewhere were spared.

4079
04:08:31,940 --> 04:08:36,940
The total sort of ruiness war that the 
second world war brought to so many 

4080
04:08:36,940 --> 04:08:40,661
areas,
but the places where the war was 

4081
04:08:40,661 --> 04:08:40,940
actually fought were devastated and not 
just devastated,

4082
04:08:40,941 --> 04:08:43,700
permanently scarred,
maybe permanently ruined.

4083
04:08:44,060 --> 04:08:47,240
Certainly for several foreseeable 
lifetimes.

4084
04:08:47,390 --> 04:08:52,390
Author Donovan Webster wrote a whole 
book on the state of those battlefields 

4085
04:08:52,491 --> 04:08:55,790
in earlier wars today,
and the most polluted,

4086
04:08:56,180 --> 04:09:01,180
most dangerous,
most impossible to imagine them ever 

4087
04:09:01,180 --> 04:09:04,961
cleaning up are all these ones that the 
first world war fought on the western 

4088
04:09:04,961 --> 04:09:08,060
front in these places where things 
didn't move for years because the shells

4089
04:09:08,090 --> 04:09:13,090
buried themselves in the ground.
I don't remember what the exact 

4090
04:09:13,090 --> 04:09:14,160
percentage that they that they estimated

4091
04:09:14,280 --> 04:09:17,490
the number of duds versus the number of 
good shells were,

4092
04:09:18,060 --> 04:09:23,060
but since 1946 French specialists have 
removed 18 million shells and they 

4093
04:09:27,661 --> 04:09:32,400
estimate that there's another 12 million
just around Verdun.

4094
04:09:33,840 --> 04:09:36,840
The biggest shells,
like those Paris gun shells,

4095
04:09:36,841 --> 04:09:39,750
the duds from those are so deep in the 
earth,

4096
04:09:39,780 --> 04:09:43,320
they won't even make their way to the 
surface for 60 years.

4097
04:09:45,580 --> 04:09:50,580
Hundreds and hundreds of these people 
who go and try to clean up these areas 

4098
04:09:50,580 --> 04:09:52,000
die.
There've been farmers killed,

4099
04:09:52,001 --> 04:09:57,001
there were like 35 killed in one year 
when their tractors were hitting shells 

4100
04:09:57,001 --> 04:09:57,880
and some of these shells,
as you might imagine,

4101
04:09:58,300 --> 04:10:03,300
are chemical weapons.
The problems that these people have 

4102
04:10:03,300 --> 04:10:07,171
trying to reclaim the areas are so bad 
that they just have cordoned off the 

4103
04:10:07,171 --> 04:10:10,351
area since the war and millions upon 
millions of acres of France and part of 

4104
04:10:10,571 --> 04:10:13,060
Belgium are just shut down too 
dangerous,

4105
04:10:13,630 --> 04:10:18,630
so it's like the world's biggest garbage
dump with human beings all ground up 

4106
04:10:18,630 --> 04:10:23,011
through it and then it's littered with 
booby trapped explosives and chemical 

4107
04:10:23,011 --> 04:10:24,620
weapons.
Good luck cleaning that moon scape up.

4108
04:10:26,530 --> 04:10:31,530
The Germans had thought that they were 
signing something more like an 

4109
04:10:31,530 --> 04:10:33,310
armistice,
more like a succession of hostilities,

4110
04:10:33,490 --> 04:10:38,490
more like some deal along the lines of 
what they thought Woodrow Wilson was 

4111
04:10:38,490 --> 04:10:42,331
talking about in the 14 points.
What they ended up with was more like a 

4112
04:10:42,331 --> 04:10:46,210
surrender and truly given their military
condition.

4113
04:10:46,211 --> 04:10:48,280
That's probably what they should have 
been doing,

4114
04:10:48,970 --> 04:10:53,970
but even as the war was winding down,
ludendorff changed his mind at the last 

4115
04:10:55,240 --> 04:11:00,240
minute and wanted to restart the 
conflict right before the armistice 

4116
04:11:00,240 --> 04:11:00,710
actually took effect.
Wouldn't that have been,

4117
04:11:00,711 --> 04:11:01,480
uh,
interesting.

4118
04:11:01,481 --> 04:11:03,310
What if scenario.
Nonetheless,

4119
04:11:03,311 --> 04:11:08,311
his army was ready to go home and in a 
lot of cases was going home by the end 

4120
04:11:08,311 --> 04:11:12,720
and the Germans had at least a million 
people that they thought were shirking 

4121
04:11:12,720 --> 04:11:16,080
or not listening to orders or simply 
refusing to fight anymore the deal at 

4122
04:11:16,241 --> 04:11:21,241
the end of the war and the difference 
that the Germans thought they were 

4123
04:11:21,241 --> 04:11:24,241
getting versus what they actually got 
was one of the seeds that sews the 

4124
04:11:24,241 --> 04:11:27,661
future bitterness.
The German navy manages to sort of give 

4125
04:11:27,661 --> 04:11:30,910
the middle finger to the allies.
You know,

4126
04:11:30,911 --> 04:11:34,270
the year after the war is over,
when they're transferring their fleet to

4127
04:11:34,271 --> 04:11:39,271
Britain as part of the mandated things 
that they had to do with the peace 

4128
04:11:39,271 --> 04:11:44,131
treaty.
And they intentionally sink a bunch of 

4129
04:11:44,131 --> 04:11:44,131
the ships.

4130
04:11:44,230 --> 04:11:47,950
So they may have rioted against their 
own officers at the end of the war.

4131
04:11:48,190 --> 04:11:53,190
But that didn't mean they wanted the 
former enemy to end up in possession of 

4132
04:11:53,190 --> 04:11:57,271
their vessels.
I'd also like to quickly mention 

4133
04:11:58,160 --> 04:12:03,160
something that I think you're aware of 
that's been throughout this whole 

4134
04:12:03,160 --> 04:12:05,711
program,
but the ripples of pain that these wars 

4135
04:12:05,711 --> 04:12:10,031
and all these deaths and maimings and 
suffering's caused the number of people 

4136
04:12:10,031 --> 04:12:14,920
in a relating to the or civilian who 
experienced the horribleness and how 

4137
04:12:14,920 --> 04:12:19,090
that just radiates across societies.
You can go read the.

4138
04:12:19,250 --> 04:12:24,250
The artists have this postwar generation
and and sometimes it's just so 

4139
04:12:24,250 --> 04:12:25,210
incredibly haunting.
I mean,

4140
04:12:25,211 --> 04:12:26,200
you'll read it.
They'll talk about,

4141
04:12:26,201 --> 04:12:31,201
for example,
that there are all these women who 

4142
04:12:31,201 --> 04:12:31,201
sweethearts or patrol,
there are people that,

4143
04:12:31,260 --> 04:12:36,260
you know,
they maybe would've married somewhere 

4144
04:12:36,260 --> 04:12:37,801
down the road,
didn't exist because they died in the 

4145
04:12:37,801 --> 04:12:37,801
war.
So they ended up spinsters.

4146
04:12:37,801 --> 04:12:41,600
I mean just decades of pain in a 
rippling through the societies and a 

4147
04:12:43,531 --> 04:12:48,531
sense of loss.
And oftentimes in some of these nation 

4148
04:12:48,531 --> 04:12:51,260
states plagued by chaos,
you know,

4149
04:12:51,261 --> 04:12:53,680
as they tried to find their new path.
I mean,

4150
04:12:53,681 --> 04:12:58,681
Germany is a perfect example.
Rushes and even better one people we're 

4151
04:12:58,681 --> 04:13:02,461
often confused and sometimes caught up 
in the wheels of things that they had no

4152
04:13:03,971 --> 04:13:08,971
control over.
How'd you like to be some civilian 

4153
04:13:08,971 --> 04:13:11,650
living in a country that went fascist on
you or Bolshevik on you,

4154
04:13:12,280 --> 04:13:13,450
where that fell apart?

4155
04:13:15,210 --> 04:13:20,210
I'd like to point out that the problem 
with this story that we did here is the 

4156
04:13:21,931 --> 04:13:25,110
same problem you often run into if you,
you know,

4157
04:13:25,111 --> 04:13:27,840
read or speak in the English language 
and you want to,

4158
04:13:28,310 --> 04:13:33,310
you know,
get a hold of something about the first 

4159
04:13:33,310 --> 04:13:35,361
world war.
I've often said that doing these 

4160
04:13:35,361 --> 04:13:37,701
programs has given me the most sympathy 
for the people who actually write these 

4161
04:13:39,241 --> 04:13:43,680
books and create the materials that we 
use as sources for this program,

4162
04:13:43,681 --> 04:13:48,681
for example.
Because once you try to do even a pale 

4163
04:13:48,681 --> 04:13:51,280
imitation of what they're trying to do,
you instantly see,

4164
04:13:51,330 --> 04:13:52,890
have all your questions answered,
right?

4165
04:13:52,891 --> 04:13:53,220
I'll say,
well,

4166
04:13:53,221 --> 04:13:58,221
why didn't they do this?
And then you start to do this kind of a 

4167
04:13:58,221 --> 04:13:58,221
show yourself and you go,
oh my gosh,

4168
04:13:58,221 --> 04:14:00,750
how am I ever going to include this 
without screwing something up?

4169
04:14:01,080 --> 04:14:06,080
I mean,
if there's anybody who got really 

4170
04:14:06,080 --> 04:14:06,080
shafted in this story,
I mean,

4171
04:14:06,080 --> 04:14:10,401
I,
I can think of numerous peoples who 

4172
04:14:10,401 --> 04:14:10,401
deserved a ton more time,
but I think we alluded to it earlier.

4173
04:14:10,401 --> 04:14:12,570
The French are an enormous part of the 
story.

4174
04:14:12,571 --> 04:14:15,060
I didn't even get to Clemons,
so that's inexcusable,

4175
04:14:15,061 --> 04:14:17,010
right?
How do you even get away with that?

4176
04:14:17,030 --> 04:14:22,030
Carlin?
All I can say is look how long this 

4177
04:14:22,030 --> 04:14:22,920
series is now.
I mean,

4178
04:14:23,430 --> 04:14:27,300
I left out tons of stuff to get it down 
to this enormous length.

4179
04:14:27,301 --> 04:14:32,301
Isn't that terrible?
And what about the people in the 

4180
04:14:32,301 --> 04:14:32,301
Balkans?
Right?

4181
04:14:32,301 --> 04:14:34,911
This is where the whole war begins.
Those are the people who've had an 

4182
04:14:34,911 --> 04:14:36,210
amazing history right before the first 
world war.

4183
04:14:36,250 --> 04:14:41,250
They are finding themselves in their 
national identity and consciousness is 

4184
04:14:41,250 --> 04:14:41,250
all coming together.
I mean,

4185
04:14:41,250 --> 04:14:45,270
it's a fantastically both traumatic and 
dramatic time of change.

4186
04:14:45,271 --> 04:14:45,650
I mean,
it's,

4187
04:14:45,670 --> 04:14:47,400
it's colorful.
It's interesting.

4188
04:14:48,660 --> 04:14:50,690
The situation in the Middle East with 
the Ottomans and,

4189
04:14:50,840 --> 04:14:51,350
and,
and,

4190
04:14:51,351 --> 04:14:56,351
and the modern Middle East beginning to 
form Africa got totally shafted in this 

4191
04:14:56,351 --> 04:15:01,341
story.
Could have been a whole podcast series 

4192
04:15:01,341 --> 04:15:04,011
on the first World War in Africa and the
Far East is busy setting the stage for 

4193
04:15:04,011 --> 04:15:08,451
the Pacific War and the Second World War
and we dealt with it minimally as a 

4194
04:15:09,501 --> 04:15:09,950
point of

4195
04:15:09,980 --> 04:15:14,980
explanation though I might point out the
lack of good English works on this 

4196
04:15:16,821 --> 04:15:19,910
subject.
We have a lot of quotes from Germans,

4197
04:15:19,911 --> 04:15:22,910
a lot of quotes from British folks and 
their dominions.

4198
04:15:23,060 --> 04:15:28,060
A lot of quotes from the United States.
There are not a ton of good books even 

4199
04:15:28,060 --> 04:15:31,781
on the French where you get a lot of 
firsthand accounts from soldiers are 

4200
04:15:31,781 --> 04:15:34,751
their experiences.
I found one really good one and we've 

4201
04:15:34,751 --> 04:15:37,811
used it in the show,
but if that guy wasn't at the battle 

4202
04:15:37,811 --> 04:15:39,941
you're talking about,
all of a sudden the sources are hard to 

4203
04:15:39,941 --> 04:15:40,940
come by.
Love to have more from the Russian side,

4204
04:15:41,270 --> 04:15:45,740
the Balkans,
the Ottomans to Africa would be great to

4205
04:15:46,790 --> 04:15:51,790
finally,
there were some subjects we could have 

4206
04:15:51,790 --> 04:15:51,790
gone into more deeply that I know a lot 
of you want.

4207
04:15:52,040 --> 04:15:55,760
I mean some of you people geek out about
the military side of history is I do.

4208
04:15:56,360 --> 04:16:00,080
We did do some discussions on airplanes 
that didn't make it into the show.

4209
04:16:00,081 --> 04:16:05,081
We did some deeper stuff on the war 
ships that did make it into another 

4210
04:16:05,081 --> 04:16:09,401
show.
Those will all be rolled together with 

4211
04:16:09,401 --> 04:16:12,070
some other popery I put together in the 
extra show whenever we get that out and 

4212
04:16:12,070 --> 04:16:13,940
I'm not promising when that happens.
I got another one of the real,

4213
04:16:14,120 --> 04:16:19,120
you know,
regular history shows to start working 

4214
04:16:19,120 --> 04:16:19,120
on right away because you folks have 
been patient with me.

4215
04:16:19,120 --> 04:16:21,770
This one took longer than any we've ever
had in the past and will.

4216
04:16:21,771 --> 04:16:24,320
I guess you could probably see why.
Go look at the reading list.

4217
04:16:24,620 --> 04:16:28,700
Be Nice to do a subject that is not as 
well documented next time.

4218
04:16:29,120 --> 04:16:30,980
Thank you for everything.
Ladies and gentlemen,

4219
04:16:32,340 --> 04:16:34,460
do you think the show you just heard is 
worth a dollar?

4220
04:16:34,580 --> 04:16:37,580
Dan And ben would love to have it.
A buck a show.

4221
04:16:37,670 --> 04:16:40,520
It's all we ask.
Go to Dan Carlin.com
