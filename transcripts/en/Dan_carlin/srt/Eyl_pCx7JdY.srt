1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,060
What you're about to hear is part three 
of a multipart series on the first world

2
00:00:04,061 --> 00:00:09,061
war.
If you're one of those individual that 

3
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:09,061
likes to know the story before the 
story,

4
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:11,350
you might want to catch up on those if 
you missed either one of them,

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,800
although some of you probably don't mind
just being dropped into the middle of a 

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,191
story like you arrived in the time 
machine and you have to figure things 

7
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:23,041
out.
If you're one of those kind of 

8
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,011
individuals,
you know who cares about those earlier 

9
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:26,670
two shows,
why don't you just jump on in and 

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,690
joining the horror in progress with 
blueprint for Armageddon,

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,440
part three,

12
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,390
some bus seven,
19,

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,440
41 date which will live in infamy.

14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:46,290
Each one,
the events

15
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,850
that dude,

16
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,160
the figure is going to the lead on this 
time and place.

17
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,610
I take pride in the words the Alina tear
down.

18
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:15,640
Wow.

19
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,140
Complete.

20
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,440
Hi,
welcome.

21
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:30,441
This kind of examination because people 
have got to know whether or not their 

22
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:30,910
question,
well,

23
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:35,930
I'm not a crop.
If we dig deep in our district and our 

24
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,910
doctors and remember we are not 
descended from fearful.

25
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,240
Man.

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,400
It's hardcore history.
The very same week that the first world 

27
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,760
war breaks out,
August 19,

28
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:58,761
14,
a British expedition leaves British 

29
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:02,991
waters and heads for the South Pole.
Antarctica led by a guy named Ernest 

30
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,720
Shackleton.
Shackleton is one of the people that's 

31
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,190
normally associated with the very tail 
end of what's called the age of 

32
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,760
discovery,
the age of exploration,

33
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,440
and you know what's the tail end?
Because you know,

34
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,880
unlike guys like Christopher Columbus,
Shackleton and his crew have cameras.

35
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,880
Nineteen 14,
you bring a camera with you and he's 

36
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,330
able to document in photographs.
Real clear,

37
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:30,331
interesting photographs.
This ordeal that he's about to 

38
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:33,001
experience as he's on his way to 
Antarctica,

39
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,300
he's keeping tabs on this war that's 
broken out right when he left.

40
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:42,301
I mean this is the first real period of 
globalization and the world and he can 

41
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:45,220
keep track via telegraph of the sort of 
major events that are going on

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,820
and like everyone.
Shackleton is appalled by the scale.

43
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,400
You can't believe the amount of 
casualties,

44
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:54,980
the number of people,
the challenges involved in logistics.

45
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,180
It feels like this flame that is burning
at an unbelievable intensity.

46
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,770
So everybody just assumed that couldn't 
continue very long.

47
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,130
That had been the assumption even before
the war broke out.

48
00:03:06,131 --> 00:03:08,200
The Kaiser famously says to his 
departing troops,

49
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:13,201
you'll be home before the leaves fall.
When the French military leader Joseph 

50
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:17,841
offer is told that his troops should be 
issued metal helmets to replace those 

51
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:18,280
cloth hats that they're starting the war
with.

52
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,630
He says,
don't bother.

53
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,940
They'll never reach the troops before 
the war is over.

54
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,320
So there's this real feeling that 
something that's operating at that level

55
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:31,321
of intensity can't continue for very 
long before shackleton gets to find out 

56
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:36,751
how the whole thing ends,
though he in his ship and his crew get 

57
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:38,620
trapped in the ice in the Antarctic and 
again,

58
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:39,640
photos exist.

59
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,640
It's wonderful.
You get to watch the ship as it's 

60
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,831
crushed by the ice and shackleton and 
the crew have to get out and basically 

61
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:49,240
live on the ice flows while they wait to
be rescued,

62
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,920
which is not happening fast enough.
And he can see that his people are going

63
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:57,921
to die out there.
If somebody doesn't do the really brave 

64
00:03:57,921 --> 00:03:58,720
thing and take one of the little boats.
You know,

65
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:02,710
the 20,
25 footers off the big boat amounting to

66
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:04,840
almost an open rowboat,
not quite,

67
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:09,841
but almost,
and he and a few crew members get in it 

68
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:13,080
and head out into the Arctic waters 
looking for land.

69
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,750
It's insane when you think about it and 
it's insane that he survived and in May 

70
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,060
19,
16,

71
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:21,250
he and these couple of guys that he set 
out,

72
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,880
you know,
into the Arctic with,

73
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:28,030
I mean with amazing stories of of 
towering waves and all these things 

74
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,860
stumbled into an isolated whaling 
station on south Georgia island,

75
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,890
which normally most of us would think as
penguin territory.

76
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,360
It must've seemed positively Balmy to 
shackleton and his crew,

77
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:45,510
who by this time looked like bigfoot or 
something like a missing link.

78
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,630
Totally sunburned.
The beards on their faces,

79
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:54,631
frozen and icicles hanging off them.
They were originally wearing animal 

80
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:59,371
skins,
but those skins did not like the salt 

81
00:04:59,371 --> 00:05:00,490
water very much and had melted and were 
rotting and smelled and were falling off

82
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:01,120
of them.
I mean,

83
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,960
the first thing they do when they get to
this whaling stations scare the heck out

84
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:07,990
of two boys.
A couple of 12 year olds or something,

85
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:10,810
see them first and go off running and 
who could blame him?

86
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,990
Eventually though the adults come 
running,

87
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,710
shackleton identifies himself.
He's taken in to be sort of restored,

88
00:05:17,711 --> 00:05:22,711
given water and I guess you could say 
debriefed and we're told that one of the

89
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:28,711
first questions he asks,
his benefactor is for an update on 

90
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:30,640
whatever happened with the war he was 
following and he says,

91
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:35,641
tell me when was the war over and in one
of the more famous responses you'll ever

92
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:42,871
get about this,
because it says so much in a couple of 

93
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:42,871
sentences and that's why it's gone down 
in history.

94
00:05:42,871 --> 00:05:47,611
The benefactor as opposed to have 
answered is when was the war over 

95
00:05:47,611 --> 00:05:49,420
question with the war isn't over 
millions or dead.

96
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,570
Europe is mad.
The world is mad.

97
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,950
If Shackleton reacts to this news with 
horrified,

98
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:58,820
disbelief,

99
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:04,390
then he's just catching up to the rest 
of the world because no one can believe 

100
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:09,730
that the level of intensity that this 
conflict displays from minute one can be

101
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:12,280
sustained.
Remember,

102
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,350
this war starts very differently than 
the second world war does.

103
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,960
The Second World War kind of ramps up 
slowly.

104
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:23,230
The first world war is like someone 
pulling the pin on a grenade and 

105
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,070
everything explodes at once.
Everyone attacks at once.

106
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,060
There are a lot more people killed in 
the first month of the first world war.

107
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,430
Then the first month of the second,
in fact,

108
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:36,431
so many people are killed that the 
people living through this period have 

109
00:06:36,431 --> 00:06:39,410
nothing to compare this to.
The numbers are off the charts.

110
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,950
I mean look at what they were looking at
as normal casualty numbers and by the 

111
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,960
way,
this is considered to be horrible.

112
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:47,330
So I mean they.
They thought it could be bad.

113
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,700
It could be like the Russo,
Japanese war on steroids could knit.

114
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,040
That war happened the decade before.
The first world war lasted.

115
00:06:55,041 --> 00:07:00,041
Eighteen months is seen as sort of the 
testing ground for a lot of the weapons 

116
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:02,540
and tactics and everything that would be
used in the next war.

117
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,050
And in 18 months a hundred and 65,000
people are killed.

118
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,140
It's horrible.
One hundred and 65,000

119
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:12,890
people are killed in a week or two when 
the first world war breaks out.

120
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,430
Twenty 2000 Frenchmen die in a day in 
August,

121
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:21,080
1914.
There are no metrics for that for you.

122
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:26,081
American history fans out there.
What's the worst war in American 

123
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:26,390
history?
The US civil war,

124
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:29,000
right?
Because everyone who dies is an American

125
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,490
casualty.
Last four years,

126
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,460
you lose between 600,000
and 700,000

127
00:07:34,461 --> 00:07:39,461
Americans killed.
That's how many people you lose killed 

128
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:41,630
roughly in the first month of the first 
world war.

129
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:47,530
Everyone is stunned and it's not just 
gender roles and world leaders and 

130
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:48,050
everything.

131
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:53,050
Let's say that this war can't last.
You have some of the top economic minds 

132
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,020
in the world saying that for economic 
reasons,

133
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:56,630
it can't continue.
John Maynard Keynes,

134
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,720
the guy who will later be the father of 
Keynesian economics says in 1914 that 

135
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,300
the war won't last a year.
As soon as the financial liquidity dries

136
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:05,810
up,
he says,

137
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,710
all the belligerents will be forced to 
come to terms and make peace.

138
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,490
He couldn't have been more wrong.
Countries will ditch the gold standard 

139
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,840
almost immediately.
They'll inflate their currency,

140
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,540
they'll open up lines of credit and 
they'll start borrowing.

141
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,620
It was lord her ratio,
kitchener Britain's war minister,

142
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:28,180
and one of the few people who understood
how long this war was really going to.

143
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:29,040
Last said,
quote,

144
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,420
no financial pressure has ever stopped a
war in progress and kitchen or 

145
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:40,160
understood what many of these people who
should have understood better didn't,

146
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,520
and that's that we had entered the era 
where nation states could really take a 

147
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,271
punch.
We talked about that in an earlier 

148
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:49,271
episode.
It's a mixed blessing.

149
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,600
It means that you don't succumb to the 
enemy's attacks right away,

150
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:57,060
but it means you also last longer and 
when you last longer,

151
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,300
you see your human and your financial 
capital ground into powder.

152
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,120
There are a lot of people who wonder 
whether it was actually a benefit for 

153
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,380
the French and the British to win the 
battle of the Marne.

154
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,780
That's where we left off the last 
program.

155
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,180
The Battle of the Marne at the time was 
seen as know the savior of France.

156
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:24,780
The Germans would their prewar battle 
plans with they're meticulous precision 

157
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,580
planning that had had decades to come up
with perfecting this plan.

158
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,370
They'd failed at the battle of the Marne
when,

159
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,620
when by the time you know the,
the,

160
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:35,920
the crowning moment happens where 
everything rests on what the Germans are

161
00:09:35,921 --> 00:09:40,921
doing.
Both sides are like a couple of punch 

162
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:43,541
drunk prize fighters.
We've been using that analogy for this 

163
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,161
whole conflict because it worked so well
and up until you know the French and 

164
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:52,111
British victory at the Marne.
The Germans had been the one really 

165
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:55,741
dishing out the heavy blows,
but everyone is so tired and at the end 

166
00:09:55,741 --> 00:10:00,210
of their rope,
by the time the Maren happens only a 

167
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,940
month into the conflict that you get the
feeling like it's the end of the first 

168
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,751
round of that both fighters have given 
everything they have and they're so 

169
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:08,620
tired that if anybody could just land 
one solid blow on either side,

170
00:10:08,621 --> 00:10:13,621
it'll be over on the French and the 
British land that blow and the Germans 

171
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:16,030
are forced backward.

172
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,490
They're forced backward so that they can
reorganize their lines and close up this

173
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,820
dangerous hole in their lines that was 
exploited by French and British troops,

174
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:32,430
as Churchill famously said,
as only he can.

175
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,910
Those troops were probing their way into
the German liver and it's a classic 

176
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:43,110
maneuver to try to pull your troops back
and reorganize your lines,

177
00:10:43,111 --> 00:10:48,111
but it's also a dangerous one and it 
also means that the Germans have given 

178
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,310
up on the so called Schlieffen plan.

179
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:56,710
Can I find it interesting?
Sometimes when you read some of the 

180
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,801
histories of the first world war,
you will find yourself in a very similar

181
00:11:00,051 --> 00:11:04,520
situation to the commanders on both 
sides of the western.

182
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:09,521
What will become the western front and 
that is you will be studying this as 

183
00:11:09,921 --> 00:11:13,280
though you're playing around with toy 
soldiers.

184
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,320
I mean,
I'll read stuff where they'll say,

185
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,560
you know,
this division did this and pulled back 

186
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,380
to here and you're totally losing track 
of the human element.

187
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:26,590
And the problem with that is if you 
don't understand the condition of the 

188
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,891
people on the ground,
you're going to create all sorts of 

189
00:11:29,891 --> 00:11:32,450
plans that don't take into account what 
they can actually carry out.

190
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,830
I mean,
for example,

191
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,640
the general staffs have all these armies
are tens of miles behind where the 

192
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:41,210
fighting is.
I mean,

193
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,790
most of them,
the German general staff for example,

194
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,740
are sitting in wonderful French chateaus
with roaring fire places,

195
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:53,741
drinking wine out of crystal glasses and
playing with maps and protractors trying

196
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:56,740
to decide where to move people and what 
to do with them.

197
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:02,250
And the British and the French 
commanders are often doing the same 

198
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,341
thing.
The problem is is that these little 

199
00:12:05,341 --> 00:12:08,580
protractors in these armies that they're
moving around on maps bear no 

200
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,470
resemblance to what the human beings on 
the ground or dealing with.

201
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,720
The human beings on the ground are 
spent.

202
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,990
Both sides have warned themselves down 
to the nub and can hardly function 

203
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:21,840
anymore.
I mean,

204
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,860
this is the point in the war.
Once the Germans start retreating after 

205
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,891
the battle of the Marne,
where the British and French commanders 

206
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:30,740
think they've got them on the run,
Sir John French,

207
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:34,250
the British commander thinks that he's 
going to be in Berlin in six weeks.

208
00:12:34,251 --> 00:12:39,251
It's going to be over.
We'll unleash the cavalry will launch 

209
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:39,830
this massive pursuit,
will destroy the enemy who's routing and

210
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:44,831
it'll be all over.
The problem is as Sir John French's 

211
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,730
troops are in no condition to do that.
In fact,

212
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:52,150
every side is finding out another one of
the new realities of modern warfare and 

213
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:57,350
that's that they use ammunition at a 
pace that nobody was prepared for.

214
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,400
At this point in the conflict,
everybody is actually rationing the 

215
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:08,710
artillery.
They can't even use the guns the way 

216
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,710
they want to because they don't have 
enough shells.

217
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,950
I mean,
take the Russians as a perfect example.

218
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,590
At this point in the war,
the Russians are producing 35,000

219
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:19,500
artillery shells a month.
Sounds great,

220
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:22,200
doesn't it?
Until you realize that once the fighting

221
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:25,380
actually starts,
they're using 45,000

222
00:13:25,381 --> 00:13:27,240
shells a day,

223
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,440
making $35,000
a month,

224
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,320
shooting off 45,000
shells a day.

225
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,920
Now all these armies went into the 
conflict with nice reserves of these 

226
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,450
shells,
but by a month and a half into it,

227
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,350
they are down to almost nothing and even
the French and the British,

228
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,540
you know,
as they pursued the German armies,

229
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:49,310
as the German army's retreat from the 
modern,

230
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,510
they can't function the way that they're
trained and ready to do so.

231
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:58,511
They have to ration everything and so 
did the Germans and everybody's just at 

232
00:13:58,511 --> 00:14:00,650
the end of their rope and you lose the 
human element.

233
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,890
When you study the history of things 
from the very highest levels in the 

234
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,891
moving of armies around on maps and you 
see arrows and cavalry armies and all 

235
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:12,911
these kinds of things.
When the people on the ground or in a 

236
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:15,401
completely different situation.
Here's how writer Gj Meyer describes the

237
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:19,160
situation after them on quote the French
and British.

238
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,390
Though jubilant at and in many cases 
astonished by the German withdrawal from

239
00:14:23,391 --> 00:14:26,720
the Marne were badly battered,
worn out,

240
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:31,460
and running low on essential equipment.
Many were almost too exhausted to move.

241
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,120
He's quoting an English soldier now 
quote,

242
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,850
after five days and nights of fighting,
one English soldier wrote,

243
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,220
decimated,
spent and hungry.

244
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,400
We are lying on the bare earth with only
one desire in our hearts to get 

245
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,601
ourselves killed.
Meyer continues and they were short of 

246
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:53,021
shells for their artillery.
It is one measure of the intensity of 

247
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:57,041
this new kind of warfare that the French
faced critical shortages of ammunition 

248
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:00,971
for their 75 millimeter canon.
They're most effective field artillery 

249
00:15:00,971 --> 00:15:03,050
piece because only 10,000
rounds were being produced per day.

250
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,320
That was barely 20 percent of the need.
He continues for any number of such 

251
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,220
reasons.
The armies of the entente,

252
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,340
the allies failed to close with the 
retreating Germans or exploit the huge 

253
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,090
gap that had prompted their withdrawal.

254
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,460
They did not attack in force until the 
German first,

255
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:24,461
second,
and third armies had settled into 

256
00:15:24,461 --> 00:15:24,461
fortified positions on high ground north
of the Ain,

257
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,000
the next east,
West River,

258
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,860
north of the Marne.
By then it was too late and to quote the

259
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:33,200
Germans themselves were in a horrible 
condition.

260
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,740
German soldier,
Julius Koch,

261
00:15:35,741 --> 00:15:38,360
and writes about the retreat from the 
Marne quote.

262
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,770
The streets were badly worn,
abandoned vehicles.

263
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:46,100
We're aligned on the sides of the road.
We began to move at 3:00

264
00:15:46,101 --> 00:15:49,250
in the morning and before we were fully 
aware of what was happening,

265
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,430
we found ourselves with the rear guard.
Regiments of infantry shot to pieces 

266
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:59,380
arrived in a pitiful condition.
They had cast away their knapsacks and 

267
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,510
all unnecessary impediments and we're 
trying to get along as fast as possible.

268
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,530
Soon after the first shrapnel of the 
enemy began to burst above our heads,

269
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,560
which caused us to accelerate our march 
continually.

270
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,200
The road which had also been used during
the advance,

271
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:17,380
was still marked by deep shell holes 
that were filled with water to the very 

272
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,810
edge for it rained without interruption.
It was pitch dark and every now and then

273
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:24,890
someone would fall into one of those 
shell holes we were all wet through,

274
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,640
but continue to press on.
Some would stumble over something in the

275
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:30,590
dark,
but nobody paid any attention.

276
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,860
The great thing was to get along dead 
horses and men lay in the middle of the 

277
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,731
road,
but nobody took the trouble to remove 

278
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:41,681
the obstacle into quote,
lest we forget about the human element.

279
00:16:42,381 --> 00:16:47,381
Remember that these Germans are moving 
through country that was formally 

280
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:50,330
occupied by civilians.
Where the heck are they?

281
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,750
Well,
in a lot of cases they're still there 

282
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,660
and in very great danger.
Here's what coach and writes about that 

283
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,550
quote.
The road was covered with the equipment 

284
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:03,550
the soldiers had thrown away.

285
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,860
We too had long ago cast aside all 
unnecessary ballast.

286
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,210
Thus we were marching when we passed a 
wood densely packed with refugees.

287
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:16,570
Those hunted people had stretched 
blankets between the trees so as to 

288
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:17,750
protect themselves from the rain.
They are.

289
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:22,460
They were lying in the greatest 
conceivable misery all in the jumble men

290
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:24,770
and women,
children and gray beards.

291
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,540
They're camp reached as far as the road 
and one could observe the terrible hours

292
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:33,230
that they'd lived through,
had left deep furrows in their faces.

293
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,780
They looked at us with we're retired 
eyes.

294
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,000
The children begged us to give them some
bread,

295
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,770
but we had nothing whatsoever left and 
we're ourselves tormented by hunger.

296
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,820
The enemy's shrapnel was still 
accompanying us and we had scarcely left

297
00:17:46,821 --> 00:17:51,821
the wood when shrapnel began to explode,
which caused the refugees now exposed to

298
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:56,340
the fire to crowd into the fields in an 
attempt to reach safety.

299
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,490
Many of them joined us,
but before long they were forbidden to 

300
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,460
use the road because they impeded the 
retreat of the troops.

301
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:07,730
Thus all of them were driven without 
pity into the fields soaked by the rain 

302
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:13,090
end quote.
As German soldiers like Julius or Yulia 

303
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,500
coaching are retreating back the way 
they came there being closely pursued by

304
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:25,101
their French and British fab.
The series one of whom is the Irish 

305
00:18:25,101 --> 00:18:28,551
soldier fighting in the British 
Expeditionary Force that we've talked 

306
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:28,551
about earlier.
John Lucy,

307
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:29,360
who writes about this time quote,

308
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,540
our advanced continued steadily as the 
Germans were driven back from the Marne.

309
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:39,780
Their rear guards showed some resistance
every day and occasionally we picked up 

310
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,470
stragglers and wounded from the enemy 
army.

311
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,910
Although we took our turn in our brigade
at advanced garden outpost duties.

312
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:51,150
Our battalion did not really cross 
swords with the enemy again until the 

313
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,451
14th of September.
On that day and on the few days 

314
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:57,841
proceeding it,
rain fell and we were not very 

315
00:18:57,841 --> 00:18:58,420
comfortable either.
In bivouac are on the line of March.

316
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,590
The weather began to get cold on the 
evening of 13th September,

317
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:07,770
a British airplane,
one of the few the British army 

318
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,591
possessed approached us from the German 
side and wheeling around a lighted in a 

319
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:12,760
field to the right of our marching 
columns.

320
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:18,030
The flying officer climb slowly out of 
his machine and coming stumbling towards

321
00:19:18,071 --> 00:19:21,130
us in his heavy kit.
Did Not wait to find an officer,

322
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:25,930
but shouted to us all there.
They are waiting for you up there.

323
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:30,990
Thousands of them and he waived his 
right arm toward the wooded heights 

324
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,110
across the river ane some three miles 
away,

325
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,920
and to quote the river Ain was right by 
the highest elevated point in this whole

326
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:46,411
area of the front.
Now it's not very high in terms of the 

327
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:48,400
grand scheme of geography around the 
planet,

328
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,820
but in the very flat Harry in near the 
French and Belgian borders,

329
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:57,450
it was 500 feet tall in some places and 
that gave a commanding view of all the 

330
00:19:58,121 --> 00:20:03,121
flat country around it.
This is the point that the German 

331
00:20:03,121 --> 00:20:06,841
soldiers had been told to turn back 
around and face their pursuers and dig 

332
00:20:07,721 --> 00:20:09,520
in and stopped them.

333
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,900
This had been one of the last command is
made by the former German commander,

334
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,580
the one whose job it was to carry out 
the Schlieffen plan.

335
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:22,850
Helmut von Moltke,
the younger before he totally collapsed 

336
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,410
from his nervous breakdown.
After his plan failed,

337
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,980
he's replaced by one of his critics a 
controversial choice that the kaiser 

338
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:36,540
tabbed a guy named General Eric from 
Falcon.

339
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,540
Hi.
Now,

340
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:44,100
one thing that becomes clear when you 
look at the high commands have all these

341
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:49,101
armies is the generals have outrageous 
most of the time and they often are 

342
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:55,681
jealous and they snipe at their peers 
and when Falcon hine is named,

343
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,780
it angers among other people.
Eric Luton door,

344
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,810
this young wonder kin who's been doing 
great things for the Germans on the 

345
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:06,730
eastern front and who,
who will say a Falcon Heinz appointment,

346
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,210
I am only capable of love and hate,
and I hate General Falcon Heine and 

347
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:19,761
Falcon.
Haim was critical of von Moltke before 

348
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:22,500
the battle of the Marne even starts 
Falcon High and looks at what von Moltke

349
00:21:22,501 --> 00:21:25,200
is doing and thinks he's lost his mind 
and writes.

350
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,030
On September fifth,
19,

351
00:21:27,031 --> 00:21:32,031
14 quote,
our general staff has completely lost 

352
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:33,750
its head.
Sleeping's notes do not help any further

353
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,890
and so his wits come to an end and to 
quote,

354
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,780
well,
the Kaiser must've read that and decided

355
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,750
that since von Moltke couldn't pull this
off,

356
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:49,940
maybe one of his critics can falcon hine
turns his troops around,

357
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:55,150
tells them to dig in and begins looking 
for replacements for the people who've 

358
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,080
died.
Because the German army is a fraction of

359
00:21:57,081 --> 00:22:00,650
what it was just a couple of weeks 
before and they aren't the only ones.

360
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,350
The British and the French armies have a
similar problem.

361
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:08,650
They're all decimated.
The differences is Britain and France 

362
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,191
have colonies and dominions and 
Commonwealth nations who the minute the 

363
00:22:13,071 --> 00:22:17,000
war starts are basically told to get 
people over there and there are arriving

364
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:17,570
every day.

365
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:23,910
The British have Indian troops from 
India arrive and Canadian show up very 

366
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,841
quickly.
The Scots from Scotland are always a 

367
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:31,621
part of the British forces and they 
arrive in kilts and this is where they 

368
00:22:31,621 --> 00:22:35,371
will get their famous nickname,
which some people wonder if it even 

369
00:22:35,371 --> 00:22:39,061
happened this way,
but it's too good of a nickname to not 

370
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:43,200
mention the German supposedly call them 
the ladies from Hell because of the 

371
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:48,390
kilts they were and they were all 
showing up every day in greater numbers 

372
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,590
and taking their place in the line to 
replace the dead and the wounded.

373
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,290
The French are bringing troops from 
North Africa,

374
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:58,470
from Morocco and Algeria and troops from
central Africa and places like Senegal.

375
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:02,710
So you have dark skinned black Africans.
In the French army,

376
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:08,190
something that the Germans one are not 
accustomed to and to a little dismayed 

377
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:13,561
about because they think about all of 
the black Africans left in Africa that 

378
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:15,730
may be could be brought to fight against
them too.

379
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,450
When the Germans tried to reinforce 
their own,

380
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,430
you know,
torn open ranks,

381
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,900
they have to do it with Germans.
Now they have a bunch of them people who

382
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:30,901
the minute the war was declared,
signed up and joined the forces and 

383
00:23:30,901 --> 00:23:34,621
we're in training this whole time.
The problem is that the war is only 

384
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:37,681
about six weeks old.
None of these people have had enough 

385
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:40,861
training to make them anywhere near as 
good as the soldiers they're trying to 

386
00:23:40,861 --> 00:23:41,380
replace but fall could and calls them 
up.

387
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,260
Anyway.
The situation is desperate.

388
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:48,170
The war could be lost right here,
right now and every man is needed

389
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,720
and all these troops are going to be 
thrown into the blood bath up near the 

390
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,681
French and Belgian border.
It's at that spot where the Germans had 

391
00:23:58,681 --> 00:24:02,671
turned around,
halted the retreat that had been going 

392
00:24:02,671 --> 00:24:05,791
on ever since the battle of the Marne 
taken the heights on the other side of 

393
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:09,510
the river ane and begun to Deegan 
fortify,

394
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,500
reequip reinforce and are waiting for 
their pursuers to show up.

395
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:20,190
They're French and British pursuers 
assume that they're going after a bunch 

396
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,791
of Rowdy Germans.
They're not expecting to run into 

397
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:23,791
heavily four to five positions in a 
very,

398
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:28,681
very strong spot.
Remember John Lucy and the BDF or 

399
00:24:28,681 --> 00:24:32,581
marching toward that area.
When that airplane lands in the field 

400
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:35,521
and the pilot goes running up to the 
British march column saying they're 

401
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:38,731
waiting for you.
Thousands of them on the other side of 

402
00:24:38,731 --> 00:24:38,740
the river on the night of September 
13th,

403
00:24:38,741 --> 00:24:43,741
1914,
the French and the British tried to 

404
00:24:43,741 --> 00:24:46,321
cross that river and dislodged the 
Germans from the height and it's a 

405
00:24:46,321 --> 00:24:46,420
disaster.

406
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,240
The British do this crossing at night in
heavy fog on pontoon boats for the most 

407
00:24:54,481 --> 00:24:59,481
part.
They get to the other side aside that 

408
00:24:59,481 --> 00:24:59,490
has no natural cover and that's facing,
you know,

409
00:24:59,491 --> 00:25:04,491
four to 500 foot hills in the distance,
heavily wooded and the sun comes up and 

410
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:10,431
burns off the fog,
leaving the British troops totally 

411
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:14,001
exposed and the Germans slaughter them.
Artillery machine guns even from the 

412
00:25:14,911 --> 00:25:19,911
flank,
the British stagger back across the 

413
00:25:19,911 --> 00:25:22,851
river and their commander Sir John 
French orders them to dig in and face 

414
00:25:22,891 --> 00:25:25,350
the Germans who were dug in on the other
side of the river.

415
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,900
This is the main thing.
Your history books will tell you that 

416
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,240
the first battle of the ane is known 
for.

417
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:36,320
It's supposedly the time when trench 
warfare is initiated.

418
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,150
This will be the most iconic and 
memorable part of the first world war,

419
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,960
but it's a misnomer to suggest that 
trench warfare just started here because

420
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:52,130
given the technology of the day,
trench warfare begins organically.

421
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:57,131
It's a natural human response to the 
fact that the air above ground level is 

422
00:25:57,291 --> 00:26:02,291
filled with so much steel and lead that 
it's suicide to be out in the open,

423
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:08,350
so across the entire front,
stretching all the way from the Swiss 

424
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,810
border across the entire Franco German 
border up through Luxembourg,

425
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,840
up into Belgium.
More than 400 miles and millions of men 

426
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,621
on both sides.
Long human beings have done the most 

427
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:24,020
natural thing possible.
They've gone to ground and they've tried

428
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:27,230
to get as low as possible to escape what
earns gender.

429
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:30,530
We'll call the storm of steel.
Later in the war,

430
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,040
in addition to digging down,
they throw up things called breast 

431
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,861
works,
which is putting stuff in front of your 

432
00:26:38,861 --> 00:26:39,560
position to stop the bullets from 
hitting you.

433
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,120
If you're lucky,
it's sandbags.

434
00:26:41,121 --> 00:26:43,740
If you're not lucky,
it's anything you can get your hands on.

435
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:49,100
The combination of digging in the earth 
and putting up barriers in front of you 

436
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,320
begins to fortify the entire line on 
both sides and in some spots.

437
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:56,100
The Germans and the French are only a 
couple hundred yards from each other.

438
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:02,370
The fortification of the entire line 
changes this war in ways that the 

439
00:27:02,741 --> 00:27:05,040
generals on either side are unprepared 
for.

440
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,520
They don't know what to do,

441
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,950
so they go back to the training manuals 
which say find a flank,

442
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,800
turn the flank attack in the rear.
The problem is is that there's only one 

443
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,781
tiny little area of this more than 400 
mile line where it hasn't calcified into

444
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:29,160
a normal siege situation and that's the 
area between,

445
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:34,530
you know,
this battle at the river and that has 

446
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:34,530
just happened and the ocean to the north
of it.

447
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:39,650
It's not a very big zone and both the 
British and the French on one side and 

448
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:43,911
the Germans on the other begin a crab 
like dance of death as one historian 

449
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:50,090
described it,
trying to probe their way towards open 

450
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:53,781
country for a very long time.
This was known as the race to the sea,

451
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:00,080
but historians have come to hate that 
term because it gives the false idea 

452
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,510
that somehow reaching the c is the goal 
of both these sides would.

453
00:28:03,511 --> 00:28:06,150
In fact,
if both sides reached the sea,

454
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:11,450
it means that there are no flanks 
anymore and there will be several big 

455
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:16,311
battles between the army's as they 
collide in their attempt to find an open

456
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:19,840
flank to turn.
Now,

457
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,320
it's worth pointing out here that what 
we're about to experience is the most 

458
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,650
complicated war I've ever studied and 
it's a very unusual conflict because in 

459
00:28:30,011 --> 00:28:33,640
many cases,
the battlefield is not going to change.

460
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,520
This area up near the Franco Belgian 
border,

461
00:28:36,521 --> 00:28:41,521
for example,
is going to become one of the worst 

462
00:28:41,521 --> 00:28:44,490
killing grounds,
extended killing grounds in all human 

463
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:44,490
history,
and later in the war,

464
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:49,170
troops marching up to this battle ground
will be able to smell it before they 

465
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,380
actually get there.

466
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,140
In addition,
when one side attacks,

467
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:57,010
the other side will often counter 
attack,

468
00:28:57,011 --> 00:29:00,270
so if you look at the battle on a map,
it makes no sense at all.

469
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:05,271
I've got 400 page books that deal with 
just single encounters between the two 

470
00:29:05,271 --> 00:29:09,090
sides and it's impossible to make heads 
or tails of it even with maps,

471
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,120
even if you're an expert.
And part of the reason why is because 

472
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,001
the nature of battle has changed.
Armies are staying in contact with each 

473
00:29:17,001 --> 00:29:21,591
other now,
and that's very different than through 

474
00:29:21,591 --> 00:29:21,591
most of human history.
Through most of human history.

475
00:29:21,591 --> 00:29:23,190
Armies come together,
there's a short,

476
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:28,250
sharp clash,
and then they break contact and move in 

477
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:28,250
opposite directions.
Again,

478
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:32,100
battles that last more than one day are 
extremely rare.

479
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,160
Up until this time period,
all of a sudden,

480
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,040
these armies aren't going to break 
contact.

481
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:43,041
They're going to stay on opposite sides 
of a short little no man's land and hold

482
00:29:43,301 --> 00:29:48,301
each other by the throat even on so 
called quiet parts of the front.

483
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,720
Hundreds or thousands of men can be 
killed every day.

484
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:58,290
Now,
this is not unheard of near the end 

485
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,800
stages of the US civil war,
ulysses s grant,

486
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:04,801
the northern general,
will have a similar strategy where he 

487
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:06,370
maintains contact with the enemy,
grabs them by the throat,

488
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:10,300
doesn't let them go and grind them down.
A strategy of attrition,

489
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:15,780
but that's new to the European 
experience and neither side's giving up 

490
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,360
yet they're going to try to find that 
flank until there is no flank anymore.

491
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,720
That race to the sea will involve 
several more big battles including one 

492
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,640
that involves you know what's left of 
the poor Belgian army.

493
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,610
Remember the Belgian army was what the 
Germans thought.

494
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:35,611
We're going to be a bunch of chocolate 
soldiers and instead they put up this 

495
00:30:35,611 --> 00:30:37,200
heroic doomed resistance to them.
You know,

496
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,970
fighting and being pushed backwards 
every step of the way.

497
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:45,210
Once the Germans reform their lines at 
the river and their entire flank is 

498
00:30:45,851 --> 00:30:48,790
threatened by the parts of Belgium that 
haven't fallen to them yet,

499
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:53,200
including the giant and vital port city 
of Antwerp.

500
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:59,040
So this is when the Germans go take all 
that they pound and top with those same 

501
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,631
enormous guns that they destroyed the 
Belgian forts with at the beginning of 

502
00:31:03,631 --> 00:31:04,600
the war and they pushed the Belgian 
army.

503
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:09,601
All the ways too that the Belgians are 
sitting there with their backs to the 

504
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:13,021
ocean.
There is no place left to run and the 

505
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:17,011
Belgian king is with them.
And at one point he orders his officers 

506
00:31:17,011 --> 00:31:20,551
to stand behind the trenches and shoot 
any Belgian soldiers that dare run away 

507
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:25,260
and they stay there being pounded by the
artillery until they can't stop the 

508
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:30,001
Germans.
They realized that if they don't hold 

509
00:31:30,001 --> 00:31:34,021
that area,
the Germans are going to be the one who 

510
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:34,021
find that open flank and the turn,
the British and the French.

511
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:34,740
And this is,
you know,

512
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:40,030
the part of the war where it looks like 
the Germans might actually reverse the 

513
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,200
entire battle of the Mons results and 
when any way.

514
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,380
So the Belgians do something that is,
you know,

515
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,500
their nuclear option and it's a,
it's a sacrifice that might have saved 

516
00:31:51,731 --> 00:31:54,700
the war for the allies.
Remember,

517
00:31:54,701 --> 00:31:57,460
Belgium is one of those areas of Europe 
that is actually,

518
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,010
for the most part,
this part of flanders that we're talking

519
00:32:00,011 --> 00:32:05,011
about in Belgium below sea level.
And the reason that it even exists is 

520
00:32:05,011 --> 00:32:09,571
because you know,
forever the Belgians have been pumping 

521
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:12,421
out water and building dikes and things 
like that to keep the ocean out the king

522
00:32:13,061 --> 00:32:18,061
of Belgium.
When things become desperate to the 

523
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:20,191
point of doomsday blows up the dykes,
the Belgian king makes the decision to 

524
00:32:21,971 --> 00:32:26,971
let the seawater in on October 22nd,
and it's a true sacrifice because he's 

525
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,130
not just flooding one of the more 
fertile parts of his country.

526
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:35,370
He's flooding it with sea water and the 
salt water will do terrible damage to 

527
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,460
the fertility of the region.
Remember,

528
00:32:36,461 --> 00:32:41,461
the Romans supposedly would so salt into
the ground of the territory of their 

529
00:32:41,931 --> 00:32:44,780
very worst enemies so that nothing would
ever grow.

530
00:32:44,781 --> 00:32:48,230
There again,
the Belgians had done this to themselves

531
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:53,500
voluntarily to protect the very end of 
the allied line and keep the Germans 

532
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:56,990
from breaking through and perhaps taking
the channel ports,

533
00:32:56,991 --> 00:32:58,340
which would have been a disaster.

534
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,550
The Germans have no idea what's going on
as the water level rises,

535
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,880
but within a couple of days there's a 
five mile wide shoulder deep lake 

536
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,640
separating them and the Belgian forces 
and the Belgians will stay behind that 

537
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,691
lake for years.
That essentially shuts off that part of 

538
00:33:18,691 --> 00:33:20,920
the front.
The bad news for the other allied forces

539
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:26,340
is that now that the Germans didn't need
those troops to try to deal with the 

540
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,031
Belgians,
they turn them around and threw them 

541
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:30,400
into the developing battle at a place 
called [inaudible],

542
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:36,150
which on October,
22nd breaks out big time and eat crap 

543
00:33:36,251 --> 00:33:41,251
becomes this point where the true 
futility of the wasting of lives is so 

544
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:49,110
aptly demonstrated because of course,
war is all about spending lives to 

545
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,390
achieve a goal.
The tragedy happens when you spend lives

546
00:33:52,391 --> 00:33:57,391
for no good reason and an eat pray.
You begin to see the kinds of tragic 

547
00:33:57,581 --> 00:34:02,581
levels that this will reach a large 
number of the troops that the Germans 

548
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:03,870
had called up.
You know,

549
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,490
with very little training or young 
people,

550
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:12,390
students whose teachers had 
indoctrinated them into the idea that 

551
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:16,111
this is what you do when you fight for 
Germany and what a great honor it's 

552
00:34:16,111 --> 00:34:16,111
going to be.
You know,

553
00:34:16,111 --> 00:34:20,051
when they would all join up together as 
students with fraternity badges and all 

554
00:34:20,051 --> 00:34:21,430
these things.
And after very little training,

555
00:34:21,431 --> 00:34:26,431
they were thrown into this combat that 
was developing around the city of Ipa 

556
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:27,190
and the surrounding area

557
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,940
in one of the really tragic parts of the
conflict,

558
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:38,720
the students would run up against what 
was left of some of the greatest 

559
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,371
military units in the world,
what was left of the old British 

560
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:46,140
professional army,
which had been ground down.

561
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,850
You know,
ever since the war started,

562
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:50,520
but still had some of its best units 
intact.

563
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:56,690
These badly trained 16,
17 and 18 year old kids

564
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:06,340
would be massacred for no good reason.
As author Winston Groom writes,

565
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:11,961
quote on a front of nearly 20 miles,
tens of thousands of men came to grips 

566
00:35:13,051 --> 00:35:15,510
and did their best to murder each other 
in the cold,

567
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,240
Dank,
misty hill surrounding April.

568
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:23,630
In many places,
the fighting was hand to hand that 

569
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,050
morning,
divisions of the German Fourth Army 

570
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,200
consisting in large part of students 
attack the British line,

571
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,620
such as it was in a fit of Wagnerian 
frenzy.

572
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:36,660
The German students came on arm in arm 
or waving their rifles in the air,

573
00:35:36,661 --> 00:35:41,661
singing and with their spiked pickle.
How the helmets festooned with flowers 

574
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,050
by the thousands they were shot down 
even though they outnumbered the British

575
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:51,051
at times six to one that morning.
They faced the most professional and 

576
00:35:51,051 --> 00:35:53,880
elite regiments of the British Army,
if not the world,

577
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,030
the Black Watch,
coldstream guards',

578
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,930
Scots Guards,
Cameron's Grenadier Guards,

579
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,210
Irish Guards,
Stafford's,

580
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,740
Gordon,
highlanders,

581
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:06,000
green,
howards,

582
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,020
royal,
Scots,

583
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,640
fusiliers,
Welsh,

584
00:36:08,641 --> 00:36:13,641
fusiliers,
and others almost too numerous to 

585
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:13,641
mention,
including the [inaudible] and dragons of

586
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:18,501
the Cavalry Corps when it was all over.
The British official history estimated 

587
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,270
that at least half of these youthful 
teutonic warriors,

588
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,330
100,000
of them had been shot down.

589
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,900
The Germans named the battle,
the massacre of the innocence and quote 

590
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,960
in German it was the kinder Morgan and 
after the war,

591
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,560
the parents of some of these children 
would put a poignant monument over 

592
00:36:39,571 --> 00:36:44,571
there,
mass grave showing a weeping father and 

593
00:36:44,571 --> 00:36:48,081
mother looking out over the mass graves 
festooned with the fraternity pins of 

594
00:36:50,101 --> 00:36:55,101
these young kids who thought war was 
going to be a romantic,

595
00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:56,550
heroic adventure.

596
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:03,230
I'm not going to focus on battle after 
battle after battle of pointless 

597
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:08,211
conflict in this story.
It's a complicated and detailed enough 

598
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:14,601
conflict.
Did you kind of have to pick your 

599
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:14,601
battles,
if you'll pardon the pun,

600
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:19,330
and it's the human side of this affair 
that I want to focus on what the people 

601
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,870
who were living through it,
we're forced to experience.

602
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:28,060
For example,
20 year old Herbert Solves Bach,

603
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:33,600
a gunner who had joined up as the war 
starts and it was getting his first 

604
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,190
taste of battle as the battle of eep or 
begins and he writes,

605
00:37:36,191 --> 00:37:38,650
quote,
change of position.

606
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:43,950
We pull forward,
get our first glimpse of this 

607
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,400
battlefield and have to get used to the 
terrible scenes and impressions,

608
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,140
corpses,
corpses,

609
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:52,141
and more corpses rubble and the remains 
of a captured village trenches hastily,

610
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:53,230
Doug,
by the British,

611
00:37:53,231 --> 00:37:58,231
are full of bodies.
We get driven out of this position by 

612
00:37:58,231 --> 00:38:00,550
infantry and artillery fire.
We stand beside the guns with the horses

613
00:38:00,551 --> 00:38:05,551
and a dreadful night comes down on us.
We've seen too many horrible things all 

614
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:09,961
at once.
They make a very strong impression on 

615
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:09,970
us.
Barely 20 years old as we are,

616
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,680
but these things also hardened us up for
what's going to come and to quote,

617
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,920
he's not the only one.
The German writes to his sweetheart with

618
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:28,580
care for her sensibilities and an 
understanding of what military 

619
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:32,421
censorship might do to his letter about 
what the reality of what he's 

620
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:36,321
experiencing is like,
and he writes during these battles in 

621
00:38:36,321 --> 00:38:38,440
Flanders,
quote my dear Maria,

622
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:41,380
I feel so terrible.
I'd really rather not write to you.

623
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,390
That doesn't mean I've forgotten you 
though.

624
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:48,590
Every day spent here makes it clearer to
me how beautiful home is and what a 

625
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,070
crowd of feelings that word home brings 
out in me.

626
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,090
I've lived through such horror recently.
No words can describe it.

627
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:00,360
The tragedy all around me,
every day the fighting gets fiercer and 

628
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,710
there is no end in sight.
Our blood is flowing in torrance.

629
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,120
When I think of our 247th regiment,
my ice swim with tears.

630
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,170
The first and second battalions have 
only 250 to 300 men left.

631
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:16,560
So more than half are gone today.
Only a few of my comrades will be still 

632
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,860
standing.
My company commander,

633
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:23,100
Lieutenant Moss Power,
had been at the front for one hour when 

634
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:23,890
he was shot through the head Pale and 
close to death.

635
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,010
He was carried past me today.
Sunday,

636
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,800
I stood at this modest grave and joined 
in prayer.

637
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,640
That's how it is all around me.
The most gruesome devastation.

638
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,210
Dead and wounded soldiers,
dead and dying animals,

639
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,190
horse cadavers,
burned out,

640
00:39:39,191 --> 00:39:40,990
houses,
dug up fields,

641
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,700
cars,
clothes,

642
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,670
weaponry.
All of this is scattered around me.

643
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:48,910
A real mess.
I didn't think war would be like this.

644
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:54,210
We can't sleep for all the noise.
At least 30 shells exploded once the 

645
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:58,681
whole time.
We called for backup yesterday and 

646
00:39:58,681 --> 00:39:58,681
today.
I hope they make it.

647
00:39:58,681 --> 00:40:00,730
There are only a few of us left to 
tackle the English.

648
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:04,030
I managed to wash myself properly 
yesterday for a change.

649
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:07,630
My beard is getting ever longer.
Otherwise I'm feeling fine.

650
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:10,900
As you can see,
all this noise is not going to ruffle my

651
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:15,901
Wurtenburg calm and cool.
That's from a German soldier named Paul 

652
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:22,100
Hub.
This war brings out the extremes of 

653
00:40:23,241 --> 00:40:28,241
humanity and even the most monstrous 
human beings that you can pick out 

654
00:40:28,851 --> 00:40:33,851
throughout history,
exhibit some of that humanity through 

655
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:35,750
their writing.
If you go read one of the most monstrous

656
00:40:35,751 --> 00:40:39,830
human beings who's ever lived,
chronicles of this combat,

657
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:44,680
even he seemed somewhat human by the 
whole thing out off hit,

658
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:49,370
but it was there in flanders in 1914 at 
these battles.

659
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,570
It was his first encounter with combat 
and he wrote about it in his book,

660
00:40:53,571 --> 00:40:55,310
mine comp and said quote

661
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:01,540
at last.
The day came when we left Munich to 

662
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,710
begin the fulfillment of our duty.
For the first time I saw the Rhine as we

663
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,500
rode westward along.
That's quiet waters to defend it.

664
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:10,700
The German stream of streams from the 
greed of the old enemy.

665
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,460
When through the tender veil of the 
early morning mist,

666
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,690
the neater vault monument gleamed down 
upon us in the gentle rays of the sun.

667
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:23,020
The old watch on the Rhine roared out of
the endless transport train into the 

668
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:27,161
morning sky,
and I felt as though my heart would 

669
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:29,710
burst and then came a damp cold night in
flanders through which we marched in 

670
00:41:29,751 --> 00:41:32,870
silence and when the day began to emerge
from the mist,

671
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,990
suddenly an iron greeting came whizzing 
at us,

672
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:40,991
over our heads and with the sharp report
sent the little pellets flying between 

673
00:41:40,991 --> 00:41:43,040
our ranks,
ripping up the wet ground,

674
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,880
but even before the little clouded 
passed from 200 throats,

675
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,420
the first hurrah rose to meet the first 
messengers of death.

676
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,820
Then a crackling and a roaring and a 
singing.

677
00:41:52,821 --> 00:41:55,490
In a howling began and with feverish 
eyes.

678
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,520
Each one of us was drawn forward faster 
and faster until suddenly passed turnip 

679
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,860
fields and hedges.
The fight began the fight of man against

680
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:08,861
man and from the distance,
the strains of a song reached our ears 

681
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:13,630
coming closer and closer,
leaping from company to company just as 

682
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,660
death plunged a busy hand into our 
ranks.

683
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:17,600
The song reached us too,
and we passed it along.

684
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,010
Deutschland,
Deutschland,

685
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:19,860
Uber,
Uber,

686
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,370
lesson develop.
Four days later,

687
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:25,100
we came back,
even our staff had changed.

688
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,040
Seventeen year old boys now looked like 
men.

689
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:32,480
The volunteers of the list regiment may 
not have learned to fight properly,

690
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,110
but they knew how to die like soldiers.
This was the beginning.

691
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,590
He said,
thus it went on year after year,

692
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,590
but the romance of battle had been 
replaced by horror.

693
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:47,860
The enthusiasm gradually cooled and the 
exuberant joy was stifled by mortal 

694
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,110
fear.

695
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:53,860
The time came when every man had to 
struggle between the instinct of self 

696
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,310
preservation and the admonitions of 
duty.

697
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,490
I too was not spared by the struggle 
always.

698
00:42:58,491 --> 00:43:01,970
When death was on the hunt of vague,
something tried to revolt,

699
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:05,540
strove to represent itself to the weak 
body is reason.

700
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,440
Yet it was only cowardice,
which in such disguises tries to ensnare

701
00:43:09,441 --> 00:43:12,980
the individual,
a grave tugging and warning set in,

702
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:17,270
and often it was only the last remnant 
of conscience which decided the issue.

703
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:20,240
Yet the more this voice admonished one 
to caution,

704
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,610
the louder and more insistent it's 
lures.

705
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,340
The sharper resistance grew until at 
last.

706
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:30,341
After a long inner struggle,
consciousness of duty emerged 

707
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:30,341
victorious.

708
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,290
By the winter of Nineteen 15,
1916,

709
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:35,600
he writes,
this struggle had been for me,

710
00:43:35,601 --> 00:43:39,200
decided at last.
My will was undisputed master,

711
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,800
if in the first day is I wonder over the
top with rejoicing and laughter,

712
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,040
I was now column and determined and this
was enduring.

713
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:51,280
Now,
fate could bring on the ultimate tests 

714
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:51,280
without my nerves shattering or my 
reason failing.

715
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:56,590
The young volunteer had become an old 
soldier and this transformation had 

716
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,581
occurred in the whole army.
It had issued hard and old from the 

717
00:44:00,581 --> 00:44:03,761
eternal battles and for those who could 
not stand up under the storm while they 

718
00:44:03,761 --> 00:44:07,901
were broken and quote,
Hitler would actually leap out into no 

719
00:44:10,531 --> 00:44:15,531
man's land under a hail of bullets and 
try to rescue a commanding officer by 

720
00:44:17,011 --> 00:44:20,730
putting them on his back and carrying 
him back to the German lines.

721
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,360
It will be decorated by the Kaiser for 
this,

722
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,700
even though the man he rescued died,

723
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:31,680
what Hitler is talking about in this 
struggle,

724
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:36,681
but he has to go through to try to make 
himself do something that the entire 

725
00:44:36,681 --> 00:44:39,900
urges of humanity inside a human being,
you know,

726
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:44,901
argue against is something that every 
soldier in the war who's going to face 

727
00:44:44,901 --> 00:44:46,430
this kind of carnage needs to,
you know,

728
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:51,460
deal with at one point or another,
sometimes they don't even have control 

729
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,461
over what happens.
People will be affected by the storm of 

730
00:44:55,861 --> 00:45:00,861
steel is Ernst Junger.
We'll call it later in the war in 

731
00:45:00,861 --> 00:45:01,200
different ways,
sometimes consciously,

732
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:05,160
but sometimes in a way that defies even 
what they want to do.

733
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,650
Now.
One of the things that the human side of

734
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:12,651
the first World War requires us to look 
at is how and why are these people doing

735
00:45:13,381 --> 00:45:17,430
these things.
Intelligent human beings from the modern

736
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:22,431
era.
Look at what our grandfathers and great 

737
00:45:22,431 --> 00:45:23,670
grandfathers did in this conflict and 
can understand how and why they did it.

738
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,680
Part of it is the romance and the 
heroism and the idea of duty and what's 

739
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,101
expected of them,
and some of that is what motivates 

740
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:36,891
soldiers to continue to press forward in
unbelievable situations in combat even 

741
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:41,370
today,
but there were other elements in play,

742
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:47,150
less savory elements.
We were dealing with modern nation 

743
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:49,530
states who had ways of compelling a 
certain level of behavior.

744
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,980
There were a lot of people who were not 
brave in this combat on all sides or 

745
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:58,290
whose bodies simply would not do with 
their mind and told them to do.

746
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:03,840
Those people often had to be sacrificed.
As an example to others.

747
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:10,130
In 1914,
a British brigadier general name e l 

748
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:14,441
spears wrote about one of those methods 
that the modern state and really states 

749
00:46:14,551 --> 00:46:19,551
had for some time before this use to 
compel their troops to be brave and to 

750
00:46:19,551 --> 00:46:24,441
do their duty,
and he wrote quote generally my day had 

751
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:29,781
just been roused from sleep on the straw
or the shed and was standing in the 

752
00:46:29,781 --> 00:46:33,771
street when a little group of 
unmistakable proport came around the 

753
00:46:33,771 --> 00:46:35,460
corner.
12 soldiers and an NCO,

754
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:40,790
a firing party.
A couple of gendarmes in between them 

755
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:44,181
and unarmed soldier.
My heart sank and a feeling of horror 

756
00:46:44,181 --> 00:46:47,841
overcame me and execution was about to 
take place generally my day took a look 

757
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:53,030
and then held up his hand so that the 
party halted and with a characteristic 

758
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:56,850
quickstep went up to the doomed man.
He asked what he had been condemned for.

759
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,650
It was for abandoning his post.

760
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,860
The general then began to talk to the 
man.

761
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,750
Quite simply,
he explained,

762
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,780
disciplined to him,
abandoning your post was letting down 

763
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,961
your pals more.
It was letting down your country that 

764
00:47:11,961 --> 00:47:14,640
look to you to defend her.
He spoke of the necessity of example,

765
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,310
how some could do their duty without 
prompting,

766
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:22,610
but others less strong had to know and 
understand the supreme cost of failure.

767
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:26,550
He told the condemned man that his crime
was not Venal,

768
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:31,670
not low,
and then he must die as an so that 

769
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:32,560
others should not fail.
Surprisingly,

770
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:37,780
the rich agreed nodding his head.
The burden of infamy was lifted from his

771
00:47:37,781 --> 00:47:41,680
shoulders.
He saw a glimmer of something redemption

772
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,900
in his own eyes,
a real hope,

773
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:49,140
though he knew he was going to die,
the general went on carrying the man 

774
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:53,971
with him to comprehension that any 
sacrifice was worthwhile if it helped 

775
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:54,490
France ever so little.

776
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,710
What did anything mad or if he knew 
this?

777
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,320
Finally,
the general held out his hand,

778
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,780
meaning to shake the condemned person's 
hand.

779
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:07,140
Yours is also a way of dying for France.
She said the procession started again,

780
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:12,600
but now the victim was a willing one.
The sound of a volley in the distance 

781
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,600
announced that all was over general demo
day wiped the beads of perspiration from

782
00:48:16,601 --> 00:48:20,980
his brow and for the first time,
perhaps his hands trembled as he lit his

783
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:25,981
pipe,
and that's something that all sides will

784
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:29,170
do in this war.
It's a way of saying that yes,

785
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:33,820
you may face certain death if you walk 
into the storm that is modern combat,

786
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:36,670
but you'll also face certain death if 
you don't.

787
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:43,510
It's very important though to bear in 
mind that the fact that these soldiers 

788
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:47,510
who failed in their duty somehow are 
exposed to capital punishment,

789
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,450
does not mean that that's why soldiers 
fought.

790
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:56,350
That's something that has been present 
in most armies throughout history since 

791
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:57,000
ancient times.
Heck,

792
00:48:57,050 --> 00:48:59,090
the Romans,
if your unit fought badly,

793
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:04,480
would make the men draw lots and one out
of every 10 soldiers in the unit would 

794
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:06,980
be killed.
That was called decimation,

795
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:12,790
and to add insult to injury,
the Romans would make their comrades 

796
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:14,180
killed them.
So that's a standard part of warfare.

797
00:49:14,181 --> 00:49:17,840
Throughout most of history.
Most of these soldiers were fighting for

798
00:49:17,841 --> 00:49:22,841
much higher values.
Things that to the more cynical 21st 

799
00:49:22,881 --> 00:49:26,570
century mind sometimes almost sounded 
like you know,

800
00:49:26,571 --> 00:49:29,360
military recruiting,
marketing slogans,

801
00:49:29,361 --> 00:49:34,361
but they meant something to these people
and they mean something to soldiers 

802
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:35,420
today,
duty,

803
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,000
honor,
country,

804
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,230
sovereign God,
and what's more,

805
00:49:42,231 --> 00:49:47,231
once the soldiers get into combat a 
responsibility to your comrades.

806
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:54,480
Nonetheless,
the first world war is able to take one 

807
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,681
of the most extreme activities humans 
ever take part in warfare and make it 

808
00:49:59,711 --> 00:50:03,020
worse and start,
for example,

809
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:08,290
with what trench warfare means for the 
soldiers on the ground in terms of day 

810
00:50:08,290 --> 00:50:10,430
to day living.
Go out in your backyard,

811
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:16,210
dig yourself a hole,
sit down in it in the rain and just live

812
00:50:17,251 --> 00:50:21,860
in a day after day without any bombs,
guns,

813
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:26,000
bullets,
or murderous combat and it's horrible.

814
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,790
That's what these face,
most of them in Flanders,

815
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:32,240
one of the rainiest parts of Europe,
they live in the mud

816
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:38,510
and they can't quite get their mind 
around how that changes this whole 

817
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:43,010
romantic idea of adventurous combat that
so many of them signed up for.

818
00:50:43,171 --> 00:50:48,171
Take for example,
some of the most elite units in Francis 

819
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:51,860
military men who were in the French 
Foreign Legion and he will find 

820
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,070
themselves in holes in the ground.

821
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:59,530
Alan Seeger,
who will die on the western front in 

822
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:02,030
1916.
Rights as this trench warfare is getting

823
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:03,440
started.
Quote,

824
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,980
this style of trench warfare is 
extremely modern and for the artillery 

825
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:12,020
men is doubtless very interesting,
but for the poor common soldier,

826
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,280
it is anything but romantic.
His role is to simply dig himself a hole

827
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:19,790
in the ground and keep hidden in it as 
tightly as possible,

828
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,970
continually under the fire of the 
opposing batteries.

829
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:28,150
He is yet never allowed to get a glimpse
of the enemy exposed to all the dangers 

830
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:31,130
of war,
but none of it's enthusiasms or splendid

831
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:36,131
Elon.
He is condemned to sit like an animal 

832
00:51:36,131 --> 00:51:38,891
limits burrow and hear the shells 
whistle over his head and take their 

833
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:41,750
little daily toll from his comrades.
His feet are numb,

834
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,230
his canteen frozen,
but he's not allowed to make a fire.

835
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:47,360
He's not even permitted to light a 
candle.

836
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:50,540
He must fold himself up in his blanket 
and lie down,

837
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:53,750
cramped in the dirty straw to sleep as 
best as he may.

838
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:57,410
How different from the popular notion of
the evening campfire,

839
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,910
the songs,
and the good cheer and quote.

840
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:07,700
It's after the battles up in flanders on
the ane and an IPA or this trench 

841
00:52:08,071 --> 00:52:13,071
warfare sets in the German soldier.
Rudolph binder tries to explain what's 

842
00:52:13,071 --> 00:52:14,460
happening in 1914 when he writes,
quote,

843
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,840
the war has got stuck into a gigantic 
siege on both sides.

844
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:22,230
The whole front is one endless fortified
trench.

845
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:25,530
Neither side has the forced to make a 
decisive push.

846
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,680
Everyone seems settled on a winter 
campaign,

847
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:33,830
but as far as I can judge,
there is no possibility of an early 

848
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:36,861
finish.
We are still stuck here for perfectly 

849
00:52:36,861 --> 00:52:39,651
good reasons.
One might as well say for perfectly bad 

850
00:52:39,651 --> 00:52:40,770
reasons.
This business may last for a long time.

851
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,120
End Quote.

852
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:48,740
Now,
it's important to remember that most of 

853
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:52,011
the people who are finding themselves 
stuck in this business in 1914 aren't 

854
00:52:52,231 --> 00:52:57,231
really soldiers.
Soldiers might be expected to deal with 

855
00:52:57,231 --> 00:53:01,251
this kind of incredible experience,
but most of the troops in these uniforms

856
00:53:01,771 --> 00:53:06,771
and carrying weapons,
which you know for all intents and 

857
00:53:06,771 --> 00:53:09,411
purposes,
appeared to be soldiers six or eight 

858
00:53:09,411 --> 00:53:12,231
weeks ago were civilians.
They were shopkeepers and delivery boys 

859
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:17,510
and students and insurance salesmen and 
teachers who all of a sudden find 

860
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:22,101
themselves in circumstances that they 
just can't make sense of horrible 

861
00:53:22,831 --> 00:53:27,831
situations.
Many of these people had never seen a 

862
00:53:27,831 --> 00:53:31,911
dead body in their lives and then all of
a sudden find themselves in situations 

863
00:53:32,101 --> 00:53:37,101
like this German soldier in 1914 
describing this new phenomenon of trench

864
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:42,470
life day to day,
living in a hole in the ground with 

865
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:43,650
combat going on all around you,
and he writes,

866
00:53:43,651 --> 00:53:48,651
quote,
the dangers of trench life may be 

867
00:53:48,651 --> 00:53:51,531
realized when I say that often neither 
the dead nor wounded can be removed.

868
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,230
If you put up as much as a little finger
above the edge of the trench,

869
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,840
the bullets come whizzing around 
immediately.

870
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,860
The dead bodies must therefore be 
allowed to remain in the trench.

871
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:07,040
That is to say the dead man has got rid 
of by digging a grave for him in the 

872
00:54:07,261 --> 00:54:12,261
floor of the trench.
A few days ago a soldier was so badly 

873
00:54:12,261 --> 00:54:14,760
hit by a shell that he was cut into his 
shattered body,

874
00:54:14,761 --> 00:54:19,761
could not be removed without risk to the
survivors and was therefore allowed to 

875
00:54:19,761 --> 00:54:22,260
remain,
but presently he gave rise to a horrible

876
00:54:22,261 --> 00:54:27,261
stench and whatever they did,
the men could not get away from the 

877
00:54:27,261 --> 00:54:30,471
mutilated blackened features.
Sometimes arms and legs torn away from 

878
00:54:30,471 --> 00:54:35,031
the body are allowed to lie about the 
bottom of the trench until someone can 

879
00:54:35,031 --> 00:54:37,390
bury them.
One gets hardened in time and to quote,

880
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:44,150
getting hardened in time is what's 
happening during this period.

881
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:49,340
In 1914,
once the fighting of these major first 

882
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:53,091
battles died down because this is when 
the reinforcements arrived and the 

883
00:54:53,091 --> 00:54:54,780
reinforcements are not part of the 
regular army.

884
00:54:54,781 --> 00:54:57,720
These are the civilians from a short 
time ago,

885
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:01,590
thrown into uniform and sent into this 
hell of combat.

886
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,960
It's a little bit different for the 
veterans,

887
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,610
especially the professionals,
the British professional army,

888
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,160
you know that existed before the war 
started.

889
00:55:11,161 --> 00:55:13,860
The so called old contemptible.
Our being,

890
00:55:13,861 --> 00:55:17,580
as we said,
widdled down to practically nothing,

891
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:20,670
but there's a few of them left and 
they're trying to integrate these former

892
00:55:20,671 --> 00:55:25,671
civilians into their ranks without 
getting killed in the process because 

893
00:55:25,671 --> 00:55:29,721
those people don't know the ropes yet 
and they're doing things that scare the 

894
00:55:29,721 --> 00:55:30,750
regulars.
John Lucy,

895
00:55:30,751 --> 00:55:34,950
one of the old contemptible in the Irish
Guards in the BDF writes,

896
00:55:34,951 --> 00:55:39,951
quote,
we stood to in the wet shell holes and 

897
00:55:39,951 --> 00:55:43,551
crumbling trenches under the thunder and
blasting flashes of German high 

898
00:55:43,551 --> 00:55:43,551
explosives.

899
00:55:43,551 --> 00:55:48,320
There is no need to describe this 
bombardment except to say that it was 

900
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,861
the worst of my experience.
A few of our fellows broke under it and 

901
00:55:51,861 --> 00:55:55,320
one poor chap entirely lost his head and
ran back out of his trench.

902
00:55:55,530 --> 00:55:59,910
He had not a chance in the open.
The earth was vomiting all around us and

903
00:55:59,911 --> 00:56:03,750
he tumbled over in a few yards better to
have kept to the trench.

904
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,110
No trained soldier would leave that.
A corporal,

905
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:10,950
a burly fellow fell near me where the 
shrapnel bullet in his head,

906
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:16,100
he lay unconscious all the day nodding 
his hold head as if suffering only from 

907
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,650
some slight irritation.
And did not become still until evening.

908
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:24,950
Earlier in the day one youngster said,
what about putting him out of his 

909
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:28,921
misery?
A more experienced man explained that 

910
00:56:28,921 --> 00:56:31,681
there was no pain.
The smallest stirrings and little mons 

911
00:56:31,681 --> 00:56:32,860
came from a man who was then already as 
good as dead.

912
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:37,180
Another soldier,
Lucy says,

913
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,710
had his belly ripped open and sat 
supporting his back against a trench.

914
00:56:41,711 --> 00:56:46,060
While he gazed with fascinated eyes at 
large coils of his own guts,

915
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:49,950
which he held in both hands.
This was almost the gasoline aside.

916
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:55,050
I saw it's sequel was better.
The man's entrails had not been 

917
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:56,530
penetrated.
He got safe out of the trench,

918
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:58,420
was washed,
tucked in,

919
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:03,540
and mended well in hospital maimed men 
past crouching and crawling behind me,

920
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,760
leaving trails of blood on the ground on
their way to a ditch witch lead back 

921
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,770
into the woods behind.
Some of them were moaning to loud.

922
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,740
Unlike our old men,
he means the veterans.

923
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:20,130
One young militia man in particular came
by roaring and seeking sympathy for a 

924
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:21,850
broken arm from everyone.
He met.

925
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:25,360
A lance corporal told him that for God's
sake to put a sock in it,

926
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,370
and then if he were really badly 
wounded,

927
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:31,090
he would have no breath left to howl 
that stopped his hysterics.

928
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:36,420
I should say that the non coms of the 
old army had the worst time of all 

929
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:40,360
trying in circumstances like these to 
keep inexperienced men in hand.

930
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:45,630
Some of these men could not even fire a 
rifle properly and at times our hearts 

931
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:48,970
quailed for our safety and theirs and 
quote

932
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:55,160
this experience was so unlike with the 
soldiers of the day.

933
00:57:55,161 --> 00:58:00,161
We're accustomed to that minister of war
and war hero himself,

934
00:58:00,681 --> 00:58:04,250
Lord her ratio,
kitchener and Britain famously said,

935
00:58:04,251 --> 00:58:06,260
when seeing what this whole deal was 
like,

936
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:10,610
this is not war.
Well,

937
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:16,720
maybe it hadn't been,
but this was sort of a way of telling 

938
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,300
everyone in this generation,
welcome to the 20th century.

939
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,880
This is how it's going to be for awhile.

940
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:30,590
These battles in flanders,
like dre shatter many of the leaders 

941
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,350
confidence in what's going on.
Remember when the war starts,

942
00:58:34,351 --> 00:58:38,280
they have a plan for winning the war.
That's been worked out over years,

943
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:41,940
but once that fails,
all these generals have to improvise.

944
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:47,360
They have to create new offensive and 
new ways to win the war from where 

945
00:58:47,401 --> 00:58:52,401
things stand and after these battles in 
flanders die down and you have this 

946
00:58:52,401 --> 00:58:56,871
trench warfare setting in general,
Vulcan Vulcan Hine in Germany runs the 

947
00:58:56,871 --> 00:58:59,900
numbers and they're horrible.
I mean the battle at Ipa,

948
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:05,040
all sides combined.
You're talking about another 250,000

949
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:10,041
casualties in a few weeks.
That brings the German totals on the 

950
00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:10,200
western front.
Since the war started,

951
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:15,530
which is August to more than 750,000.
The French are topping a million.

952
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:19,440
The British had,
for all intents and purposes,

953
00:59:19,441 --> 00:59:22,160
lost their army,
the greatest

954
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,170
in the world,
small but the greatest in the world.

955
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:28,640
It's down to dozens of many new units 
that had hundreds of men,

956
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:34,030
you know,
a very short time ago and in Britain 

957
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:35,030
they're trying to scrape up replacements
and you can see how,

958
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:38,390
how bad it is by how quickly they're 
changing the requirements.

959
00:59:38,391 --> 00:59:43,391
Because when the war starts,
you have to be five foot eight inches 

960
00:59:43,391 --> 00:59:44,060
tall to be in the British army in 
October.

961
00:59:44,061 --> 00:59:47,270
They lower that to five foot five inches
tall,

962
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:52,570
a single month later in November,
they lower that to five foot three 

963
00:59:52,570 --> 00:59:55,661
inches tall.
The Germans are having a similar 

964
00:59:55,661 --> 00:59:57,230
problem.
They learned a very hard lesson in these

965
00:59:57,231 --> 01:00:02,231
battles in flanders.
You must let the troops finished their 

966
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:06,281
training because they threw away a ton 
of lives with people who weren't ready 

967
01:00:06,281 --> 01:00:08,470
to fight,
but fall.

968
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:12,030
Heinz got a more difficult situation 
because the British and the French,

969
01:00:12,031 --> 01:00:14,220
as we said,
have dominions and Commonwealth nations.

970
01:00:14,221 --> 01:00:19,221
I mean the Canadians alone in a fit of 
patriotism are sending more than 30,000

971
01:00:20,071 --> 01:00:25,071
fresh troops across the Atlantic in the 
largest transportation of troops,

972
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:31,030
you know,
in the history of the world across the 

973
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,190
large oceans on Falcon high and has to 
account for this and he can't.

974
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:37,850
He goes and he tells the civilian 
leadership that the war in the west 

975
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:37,850
can't be worn anymore.

976
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:44,200
He tells them that they have to come to 
some sort of an arrangement and he 

977
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,340
suggests making peace with somebody,
maybe the Russians,

978
01:00:46,341 --> 01:00:48,050
because if you make peace with the 
Russians,

979
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:53,200
maybe the French will lose heart.
He says all of these other nations are 

980
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,440
simply weapons in the hands of the arch 
enemy,

981
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:59,680
which is England,
and that they have to be that the 

982
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,441
British have to be the ones that the 
Germans focused on and we have to get 

983
01:01:02,441 --> 01:01:06,071
these other countries which are merely 
swords in the hand of perfidious albion 

984
01:01:06,071 --> 01:01:08,240
and he says,
we have to get them out of the war.

985
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:14,770
Now.
This is going to be very hard to do 

986
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:15,941
because way back in September,
all the allies sign these agreements 

987
01:01:15,941 --> 01:01:19,391
saying nobody will make a separate peace
nonetheless high and hopes that he can 

988
01:01:19,391 --> 01:01:20,990
make his war aims.
You know,

989
01:01:20,991 --> 01:01:23,960
no longer victory but shattering some of
these powers.

990
01:01:23,961 --> 01:01:27,080
So they leave the war.
The civilian leadership in Germany,

991
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:32,140
the politicians like Beckman whole veg 
are appalled by what Falcon High and 

992
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:36,180
tells them they can't figure out a way 
to do this because the German,

993
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:41,190
just like all these other countries are 
so appalled by the casualties and the 

994
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:44,261
blood that's been spilled that nobody is
willing to give up anything.

995
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:49,630
You've already lost too many people.
It's one thing if you lose all those 

996
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:52,991
people in a victory to another thing.
If you lose all those people in a loss 

997
01:01:52,991 --> 01:01:57,430
besides Beth holding just a couple of 
months ago was writing up plans for what

998
01:01:57,711 --> 01:02:00,950
the victory conditions in the war are 
going to be and he's got these grandiose

999
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:03,380
schemes where we're going to push the 
Russians back.

1000
01:02:03,381 --> 01:02:05,300
We're going to keep the French down 
forever.

1001
01:02:05,301 --> 01:02:08,480
We're going to have all these vassal 
states and now his chief military leader

1002
01:02:08,481 --> 01:02:09,050
is saying,
listen,

1003
01:02:09,051 --> 01:02:09,920
we can't win the war

1004
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,360
now.
Fun Fall.

1005
01:02:13,361 --> 01:02:18,361
Get Heinz rivals guys like Luton,
door from the east who already hate him 

1006
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:19,860
this early say that his attitude,

1007
01:02:20,090 --> 01:02:25,090
you know this early in the war,
is tantamount to treason and basically 

1008
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:28,941
insinuating in no uncertain terms that I
change in military leadership might 

1009
01:02:28,941 --> 01:02:32,631
change all these sorts of things.
When on Falcon Highness told that 

1010
01:02:32,631 --> 01:02:34,230
there's no way that we're ending the 
war.

1011
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:38,460
He tells his troops on the western front
to hold onto what you have.

1012
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:41,460
Never surrender a square foot of what 
you've won.

1013
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:46,610
If you do counterattack immediately and 
retake it because they've taken valuable

1014
01:02:46,981 --> 01:02:48,660
territory,
valuable farmland,

1015
01:02:48,661 --> 01:02:53,661
valuable resources,
valuable industrial land from the 

1016
01:02:53,661 --> 01:02:55,320
French,
and if he can't get the war stopped from

1017
01:02:55,321 --> 01:02:57,870
the political leadership,
he's going to hold onto what he has.

1018
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:03,080
He tells the troops on the west to 
deepen their fortifications instead of 

1019
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,940
just one line of trenches.
He wants multiple lines of trenches.

1020
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:11,090
He and all the other leaders on both 
sides begin to use this wonderful weapon

1021
01:03:11,131 --> 01:03:14,070
which doesn't seem like a weapon at all 
of barbed wire.

1022
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:18,510
Something that was first invented a 
generation before to keep cattle pending

1023
01:03:18,511 --> 01:03:23,511
in the American west.
And in the last couple of wars since 

1024
01:03:23,511 --> 01:03:26,631
then,
had been used sparingly and sort of 

1025
01:03:26,631 --> 01:03:29,271
experimentally now all sides take this 
wire with all these sharp edges and 

1026
01:03:29,311 --> 01:03:34,311
begin to use it as a fortification.
This will be another one of these iconic

1027
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:40,521
things on the western front and you 
don't even think that something like 

1028
01:03:40,521 --> 01:03:41,760
wire with little teeny barbs on it will 
make that much of a difference,

1029
01:03:41,761 --> 01:03:46,761
but it proves to be one of the most 
important elements of the of the war on 

1030
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:52,491
the western front.
You can even make a case that they will 

1031
01:03:52,491 --> 01:03:54,510
invent weapon systems which still 
dominate militaries today,

1032
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:59,070
simply to overcome the barrier created 
by things like barbed wire.

1033
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:05,570
Now it's not all bad news for the 
central powers in Germany is 1914 wines 

1034
01:04:05,941 --> 01:04:10,941
down.
Sure General [inaudible] high and has 

1035
01:04:10,941 --> 01:04:11,820
decided that he can't see a way to 
victory on the western front,

1036
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,140
but there's fighting going on on other 
fronts to his main ad.

1037
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,820
This areas in Germany,
Germany's high command,

1038
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:23,300
the ever more powerful team of 
Hindenburg and Ludendorff are believers 

1039
01:04:24,811 --> 01:04:26,970
that you can win the war by beating the 
Russians.

1040
01:04:26,971 --> 01:04:31,971
They will become part of the group of 
German generals that will be known as 

1041
01:04:31,971 --> 01:04:33,960
easterners,
people that think you can win the war by

1042
01:04:33,961 --> 01:04:36,120
being victorious in the East Falcon 
Hines,

1043
01:04:36,121 --> 01:04:40,230
one of these guys who you know as part 
of the cabal known as the Westerners,

1044
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:43,980
believers that any real victory in the 
war will come on the western front,

1045
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,100
but there are new fronts opening up his 
19,

1046
01:04:47,101 --> 01:04:51,120
14 winds down strange fronts to first of
all,

1047
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:54,690
we haven't even mentioned that there's 
fighting going on in the Pacific because

1048
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:58,260
it really is a sidebar to this story.
Japan,

1049
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:00,450
for example,
once the war breaks out quickly,

1050
01:05:00,451 --> 01:05:04,410
throws in their lot with Britain and 
France and Russia and the allies,

1051
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:07,620
they do so for purely opportunistic 
reasons.

1052
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:12,720
The Germans have some territories in the
Pacific that Japan can easily snap up.

1053
01:05:12,721 --> 01:05:14,880
It won't be much fighting.
It won't be much trouble,

1054
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:19,510
and if the allies somehow lose the war,
there's not much.

1055
01:05:19,511 --> 01:05:24,511
Germany and Austria,
Hungary and stuff can do to Japan way 

1056
01:05:24,511 --> 01:05:27,160
over in the Pacific anyway.
There's no downside to the Japanese snap

1057
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:32,161
up.
Some of these German island possessions 

1058
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:33,871
in the Pacific that takes some German 
territories on the Asian mainland and 

1059
01:05:33,871 --> 01:05:38,611
the most important part of all of those 
actions will be the fact that some of 

1060
01:05:38,611 --> 01:05:43,411
those places will be battle grounds in 
the Second World War and also that 

1061
01:05:43,421 --> 01:05:48,421
Japan's taking of German possessions on 
the Asian mainland help precipitate 

1062
01:05:48,421 --> 01:05:53,251
later war between Japan and China,
which will help create the conditions 

1063
01:05:53,251 --> 01:05:54,550
where the Japanese are part of the 
Pacific War and the Second World War.

1064
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:56,800
I mean it's more of a long term 
situation.

1065
01:05:57,430 --> 01:06:00,550
I mean it's more of a longterm cancerous
situation,

1066
01:06:00,551 --> 01:06:03,010
but Japan's been in the war since the 
beginning.

1067
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:05,260
It's part of what makes this a world 
war.

1068
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,300
But in November 19,
14,

1069
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:10,930
Turkey enters the war and this is a very
different situation.

1070
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:16,080
First of all,
the Turks are not united on the idea at 

1071
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:16,690
all.
Some of the more aggressive,

1072
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:22,140
you know,
members of the government who are now 

1073
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,451
called the young Turks sort of 
precipitated in a way that leaves the 

1074
01:06:24,451 --> 01:06:25,600
rest of the government out of the 
decision.

1075
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:30,870
They in some Germans working together 
decide to shell some Russian port 

1076
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:35,281
facilities and the Black Sea without 
getting the rest of the government's 

1077
01:06:35,281 --> 01:06:38,851
position,
and then of course Russia declares war 

1078
01:06:38,851 --> 01:06:38,851
on Turkey and boom,
they're in,

1079
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,100
but the Germans had been trying to set 
this up for a long time.

1080
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:47,580
They wanted Turkey on their side,
which is strange because Turkey is one 

1081
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:52,141
of those powers that's really having a 
hard time right now and the Germans 

1082
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:52,660
already have one of those.

1083
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:55,300
They're allied to Austria,
Hungary,

1084
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:59,290
which you know in four or five months of
war already looks done.

1085
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:04,590
The Germans will take to saying about 
they're Austrian allies that they are 

1086
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:07,420
fettered to a corpse.
Well now they're adding another corpse.

1087
01:07:07,421 --> 01:07:12,421
I mean,
you really have to admire how well 

1088
01:07:12,421 --> 01:07:14,311
Germany does in this war,
considering that they have to have the 

1089
01:07:14,311 --> 01:07:17,491
weakest powers in Europe,
not just on their side but requiring a 

1090
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:21,841
lot of their help,
but the Turks provide an interesting use

1091
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:25,540
to the Germans.
It's not that they have an army and navy

1092
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:30,541
that's going to be real helpful,
but the Turks control a nice chunk of 

1093
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:35,521
what today we would call the Middle East
and by simply deciding to get into the 

1094
01:07:35,521 --> 01:07:39,811
war,
they forced the British and the French 

1095
01:07:39,811 --> 01:07:40,660
who have a lot of possessions in that 
area to defend them.

1096
01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:46,110
They've expanded the battlefield to 
include a whole bunch of areas that 

1097
01:07:46,391 --> 01:07:48,220
nobody was fighting over before.

1098
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:52,570
Turkey got into the war.
What's more turkeys?

1099
01:07:52,571 --> 01:07:57,571
Historic enemy is Russia a Russia that 
is putting all their manpower to dealing

1100
01:07:59,531 --> 01:08:04,531
with the Germans and the ostrow 
Hungarians and all of a sudden south of 

1101
01:08:04,531 --> 01:08:08,161
all that fighting,
they now have their historic enemy 

1102
01:08:08,161 --> 01:08:08,620
Turkey in the war.
Again,

1103
01:08:08,621 --> 01:08:10,720
it's not that they're so afraid of the 
Turks,

1104
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:16,050
it's they're afraid of taking any troops
away from the main battle front to 

1105
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:19,870
defend that area at all.
Same thing with the British and the 

1106
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:23,111
French.
Now they have to take troops away from 

1107
01:08:23,111 --> 01:08:25,931
places where they're using them against 
the Germans and use them elsewhere so 

1108
01:08:25,931 --> 01:08:30,611
the Germans aren't really getting.
The Turkish armies help as much as 

1109
01:08:30,611 --> 01:08:30,611
they're getting.
You know,

1110
01:08:30,611 --> 01:08:34,991
the fact that the people they're 
fighting have to fight somewhere else 

1111
01:08:34,991 --> 01:08:34,991
too.

1112
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:38,130
Now,
for our purposes,

1113
01:08:38,131 --> 01:08:42,060
there's a wonderful little moment right 
at the beginning of Turkey's involvement

1114
01:08:42,061 --> 01:08:45,630
where the highest ranking figure in the 
Muslim world,

1115
01:08:45,631 --> 01:08:50,631
religious wise,
proclaims a jihad against the allies 

1116
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:51,360
against Britain,
France,

1117
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:52,410
Russia,
Serbia,

1118
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:55,840
and this is an era where the Muslim 
world was,

1119
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:58,230
was more united in a religious sense.
I mean,

1120
01:08:58,231 --> 01:09:03,231
nowadays it's more like the Protestant 
version of Christianity where there's a 

1121
01:09:03,231 --> 01:09:08,031
lot of different religious leaders who 
kind of all have equal standing at this 

1122
01:09:08,031 --> 01:09:12,591
time period.
The guy who was running the religion 

1123
01:09:12,591 --> 01:09:15,450
from Turkey had not total control over 
the religion,

1124
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:19,590
but he carried a lot of weight and when 
the war breaks out on November 14th,

1125
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:20,850
19,
14,

1126
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:23,520
he proclaims a holy war against Britain,
France,

1127
01:09:23,521 --> 01:09:24,300
Serbia,
Russia,

1128
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:27,390
and this is big because Britain,
France,

1129
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:32,570
and Russia all have huge Muslim 
populations and Germany's ambassador to 

1130
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:39,170
Turkey.
He says that now you know the British 

1131
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:39,170
are going to burn up in Jihad.

1132
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:42,390
Whether or not that's what really 
happens.

1133
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:45,060
If you're Britain and France and you're 
Russia,

1134
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:50,300
you need to be concerned about that and 
now you need to divert forces from other

1135
01:09:50,611 --> 01:09:53,490
crucial fronts to deal with this new 
dilemma.

1136
01:09:53,970 --> 01:09:56,670
Now,
Turkey is and has been for more than 100

1137
01:09:56,671 --> 01:10:01,671
years known as the sick man of Europe.
They've just fought two wars before the 

1138
01:10:02,971 --> 01:10:07,971
first world war,
breaks out the first and second Balkan 

1139
01:10:07,971 --> 01:10:09,890
war and lost most of those European 
possessions there.

1140
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,210
Penniless.
It's a disaster.

1141
01:10:12,211 --> 01:10:17,211
They just bought two battleships,
which they had to ask their citizens to 

1142
01:10:17,551 --> 01:10:21,270
essentially donate the money for.
They purchased them from Britain,

1143
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:23,610
and then when the war broke out,
Britain kept them,

1144
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:26,790
which was another reason the church were
not too happy with the allies.

1145
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:32,660
Nonetheless,
the fact that Turkey is going to be in 

1146
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:35,271
the war means that the British who have 
controlled Egypt for some time now have 

1147
01:10:36,661 --> 01:10:39,540
to worry about Egypt.
I have to worry about the Suez Canal.

1148
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:44,780
Also.
This is the era where oil is finally 

1149
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:48,861
becoming important in uh,
right before the first world war breaks 

1150
01:10:48,861 --> 01:10:51,891
out,
Britain lays down it's first ships that 

1151
01:10:51,891 --> 01:10:54,681
are going to burn oil instead of coal 
and everybody is starting to see that 

1152
01:10:55,291 --> 01:11:00,291
not only is oil important,
but the Middle East is a place that has 

1153
01:11:00,291 --> 01:11:02,820
a lot of it and now the Middle East is 
going up in flames.

1154
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:09,300
Some of those flames probably would have
been very welcome on the eastern front 

1155
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:13,621
at this point where the Russians and the
Germans and the ostrow Hungarians are 

1156
01:11:13,621 --> 01:11:14,130
locked in mortal combat because it 
begins

1157
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:19,130
to freeze at the end of the year as one 
might expect they may be dealing with in

1158
01:11:19,981 --> 01:11:24,981
a rain and historic cold,
one of the coldest winters on memory on 

1159
01:11:24,981 --> 01:11:27,390
the western front,
but the coldest winters in memory on the

1160
01:11:27,391 --> 01:11:32,391
western front are pretty darn average on
the eastern front and the weather 

1161
01:11:32,391 --> 01:11:33,270
conditions slow.
Everyone down,

1162
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:39,080
the eastern commanders,
Hindenburg and Ludendorff also don't 

1163
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,530
have enough troops to do anything truly 
momentous.

1164
01:11:40,531 --> 01:11:45,531
They keep begging Falcon hine in the 
Kaiser for them and they keep getting 

1165
01:11:45,531 --> 01:11:49,491
rebuffed.
The Russians are inapt when they're 

1166
01:11:49,591 --> 01:11:54,591
attacking,
but they're very tough when they're 

1167
01:11:54,591 --> 01:11:56,571
defending,
so things tend to slow down and the 

1168
01:11:56,571 --> 01:11:59,541
Russians tend to go on the defensive.
The Austral Hungarians are already 

1169
01:11:59,541 --> 01:11:59,610
almost done,
you know,

1170
01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:04,670
five months into the war and they're 
fighting the last offensive that they 

1171
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:04,860
will launch independently in the whole 
war.

1172
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:09,960
They already have a giant fortress with 
150,000

1173
01:12:09,961 --> 01:12:12,810
Austro-hungarian troops in it,
surrounded by the Russians.

1174
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:16,710
It's a bad situation.
The weather slows everything down and if

1175
01:12:16,711 --> 01:12:19,980
you actually try to follow the various 
battles going on,

1176
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:25,280
you'll notice that there's a rhythm to 
them that makes it difficult for 

1177
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,120
anything to ever be solved.
I mean,

1178
01:12:27,121 --> 01:12:32,121
one side moves forward,
the other side moves back and then you 

1179
01:12:32,121 --> 01:12:32,121
know,
they reversed course.

1180
01:12:32,121 --> 01:12:36,000
I'm historian Peter Hart does a pretty 
good rundown of the rhythm of the 

1181
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,401
eastern front at this time and sums up 
the way the first six months of war 

1182
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:42,390
ends.
You know,

1183
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:45,510
in Philadelphia and Poland and places 
like that.

1184
01:12:45,511 --> 01:12:50,511
When he writes,
quote the seesaw nature of the fighting 

1185
01:12:50,511 --> 01:12:52,440
in the east two steps forward,
three steps back.

1186
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:57,590
One step forward was becoming 
increasingly apparent to all along the 

1187
01:12:57,590 --> 01:13:01,560
line in the north for all their efforts,
the Russians only managed to hold onto a

1188
01:13:01,561 --> 01:13:04,560
token sliver of east Prussia.
In contrast,

1189
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:07,860
they lost much of Russian Poland to the 
German advance,

1190
01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:13,070
but the strategic drawback of occupying 
this territory was such that it was not 

1191
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:15,120
a particular disadvantage in the broader
scheme of things.

1192
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:20,450
It was in the south against the 
Austrians that the Russians had made 

1193
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:23,700
their biggest gains as they had overrun 
nearly all of Austrian Galitzianers.

1194
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:29,090
Just as on the western front.
The scale of the forces involved had 

1195
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:30,060
been incredible.
By the end of the year,

1196
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:35,270
143 Russian divisions faced 53 Austrian 
and 38 German divisions.

1197
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:39,690
Losses on all sides had been simply 
breathtaking.

1198
01:13:39,930 --> 01:13:43,710
By the end of 1914,
up to 750,000

1199
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:45,930
Russian soldiers,
500,000

1200
01:13:45,931 --> 01:13:50,430
Austro-hungarian and 140,000
Germans had become casualties.

1201
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:55,230
All this in just five frantic months of 
mayhem and the quote,

1202
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:01,320
it will await a change in weather 
conditions before that front heats up.

1203
01:14:01,321 --> 01:14:06,321
Again.
Throughout this most inhumane of 

1204
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:11,061
conflicts,
there are tons of stories of prisoners 

1205
01:14:11,061 --> 01:14:12,190
being killed and horrible things being

1206
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:17,190
done all over.
I mean when you have millions and 

1207
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:19,380
millions of men involved in warfare,
there are going to be stories that run 

1208
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:22,750
the gamut.
The ones though that sort of reinforce,

1209
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:28,530
you know,
your connection to humanity are there 

1210
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:31,891
too and they deserve to be pointed out.
Sometimes they were on an individual 

1211
01:14:31,891 --> 01:14:35,161
level.
There's a story from the western front 

1212
01:14:35,161 --> 01:14:37,861
that I like right around the time of 
pray about a British soldier named 

1213
01:14:37,861 --> 01:14:40,420
Willie Frazier who was wounded in the 
shoulder and who gets stuck,

1214
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:45,680
you know,
in place as the Germans overrun his 

1215
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,010
position and the stories were counted by
author Winston groom.

1216
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:53,820
Here's groom talking about frazier 
injured on the battlefield.

1217
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:59,010
Quote,
his shoulder had been shattered by 

1218
01:14:59,010 --> 01:15:01,681
shrapnel.
There was fighting and killing all 

1219
01:15:01,681 --> 01:15:04,141
around and the Germans captured him.
Having studied German in Frankfurt in 

1220
01:15:04,141 --> 01:15:08,191
1909,
he was astonished to hear a German 

1221
01:15:08,191 --> 01:15:08,660
sergeant yell out in order to shoot him.
Will.

1222
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,710
He yelled to a German officer and when 
the officer spoke,

1223
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:16,830
really recognized his accent and he 
asked if he was from Frankfurt when the 

1224
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:19,120
officer replied that he was Willie,
asked him in German,

1225
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:24,330
don't you wish you were there?
Now the two men exchanged forced grins 

1226
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:27,880
and the officer ordered his men not to 
harm frazier and quote.

1227
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:32,810
You can find stories like that all 
throughout the war.

1228
01:15:32,811 --> 01:15:36,710
People whose humanity shines through on 
an individual basis,

1229
01:15:36,711 --> 01:15:38,120
on all sides.
By the way,

1230
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:43,330
no one had a monopoly on that,
but there were times when the humanity 

1231
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:48,221
sort of just burst forth and mass 
spontaneously.

1232
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:52,460
None more famous may be overrated.
Some people say,

1233
01:15:52,461 --> 01:15:57,461
but I don't see how it can be overrated 
than what happened on Christmas Eve.

1234
01:15:57,860 --> 01:15:59,180
Nineteen,
14.

1235
01:15:59,510 --> 01:16:03,230
Especially on the western front.
The conditions are horrible.

1236
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:08,470
It's freezing.
You know your feet are stuck in gruelle 

1237
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:10,790
mud water,
but you can't get any worse,

1238
01:16:10,791 --> 01:16:15,791
and then it all freezes in.
You're stuck out there in the cold and 

1239
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:18,941
then all of a sudden the people on the 
western front see something relatively 

1240
01:16:19,161 --> 01:16:23,330
unbelievable in a conflict where you 
have shells going on every second,

1241
01:16:23,331 --> 01:16:28,331
snipers picking off anyone who raises 
his head above the trench and then all 

1242
01:16:28,331 --> 01:16:30,440
of a sudden soldiers reported hearing,
singing,

1243
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:36,460
and seeing weird colored lights.
The colored lights were often coming 

1244
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:42,520
from the German trenches.
Soldier Yulia is collection was in one 

1245
01:16:42,891 --> 01:16:47,540
of those trenches opposite the French 
saying the conditions were horrible,

1246
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:50,300
but on Christmas Eve,
this is what happened.

1247
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:50,870
Quote

1248
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:55,290
Christmas in the trenches.
It was bitterly cold.

1249
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:59,280
We had procured a pine tree for there 
were no for trees to be had.

1250
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:02,340
We had decorated the tree with candles 
and cookies.

1251
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:07,610
We had imitated the snow with wadding.
Christmas trees were burning everywhere 

1252
01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:11,961
in the trenches and at midnight all the 
were lifted onto the pair of it with 

1253
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:14,150
their burning candles.
And along the whole line,

1254
01:17:14,151 --> 01:17:17,630
German soldiers began to sing Christmas 
songs in chorus,

1255
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:22,520
old Thou blissful old thou joyous mercy,
bringing Christmas time.

1256
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:28,210
Hundreds of men he writes,
were singing the song in that fearful 

1257
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:28,310
would not.
A shot was fired.

1258
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:31,430
The French had ceased firing along the 
whole line.

1259
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:35,570
That night I was with a company that was
only five paces away from the enemy.

1260
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:40,900
The Christmas candles were burning 
brightly and were renewed again and 

1261
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:44,621
again for the first time.
We heard no shots from everywhere 

1262
01:17:44,621 --> 01:17:46,130
throughout the forest.
He writes one good hear,

1263
01:17:46,131 --> 01:17:50,690
powerful Carol's come floating over 
peace on earth and such.

1264
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:51,950
The French,
he says,

1265
01:17:51,951 --> 01:17:56,170
left their trenches and stood on the 
parapet without any fear there.

1266
01:17:56,180 --> 01:18:00,440
They stood quite overpowered by emotion 
and all of them with cap in hand.

1267
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:05,830
We too had issued from our trenches.
We exchange gifts with the French 

1268
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:06,350
chocolate,
cigarettes,

1269
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:11,380
etc.
They were all laughing and so where we 

1270
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:11,380
why?
We did not know,

1271
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:16,390
then everybody went back to his trench 
and incessantly the carol resounded 

1272
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:16,640
evermore,
solidly,

1273
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:21,590
evermore longingly.
Oh Thou blissful and quote

1274
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:26,980
private william quinten in the trenches 
on christmas eve,

1275
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:31,630
on the british side wrote about a 
similar situation farther down the line,

1276
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:35,590
quote all around us lay about three 
inches of snow.

1277
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:39,370
A typical picture postcard christmas,
things were very quiet,

1278
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:43,600
that peace and goodwill to all men 
feeling seemed to be in the air.

1279
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:46,750
We could hear the germans still strafing
up separate way,

1280
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,810
but the next night,
christmas eve even up there,

1281
01:18:49,811 --> 01:18:52,720
it was much quieter.
Something in the direction of the german

1282
01:18:52,721 --> 01:18:57,721
lines caused us to rub our eyes and look
again here and they're showing just 

1283
01:18:57,721 --> 01:19:02,491
above the parapet we could see very 
faintly would look like very small 

1284
01:19:02,491 --> 01:19:03,670
colored lights.
What was this?

1285
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Was it some prearranged signal and the 
fore runner of an attack or was it to 

1286
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,591
make us curious and thus expose 
ourselves to a sudden raking of machine 

1287
01:19:13,591 --> 01:19:17,551
gun fire?
We were very suspicious and we were 

1288
01:19:17,551 --> 01:19:19,210
discussing the strange move of the enemy
when something even stranger happened.

1289
01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:22,600
The germans were actually singing not 
very loud,

1290
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,840
but there was no mistaking it.
We began to get interested.

1291
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:28,540
The enemy,
at least we're going to enjoy themselves

1292
01:19:28,541 --> 01:19:30,250
as much as the circumstances would 
permit.

1293
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,670
Suddenly across the snow clad,
no man's land.

1294
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:38,860
A strong clear voice rang out singing 
the opening lines of annie lori.

1295
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:42,040
It was sung in perfect english and we 
were spellbound.

1296
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:46,060
No other sound,
but this unknown singer's voice to us.

1297
01:19:46,061 --> 01:19:48,280
It seemed like the war had suddenly 
stopped,

1298
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:51,580
stopped to listen to this song from one 
of the enemy,

1299
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:56,020
not a sound from friend or foe,
and as the last notes died away,

1300
01:19:56,290 --> 01:20:01,120
a spontaneous outburst of clapping arose
from our trenches encore,

1301
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:03,960
good old fritz.
End quote.

1302
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:10,900
All along the line,
the two sides would have this 

1303
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:14,121
interesting moment where they kind of 
began to emerge from the trenches little

1304
01:20:14,671 --> 01:20:16,320
by little,
you know,

1305
01:20:16,321 --> 01:20:20,640
a place where they couldn't stick a 
finger up without having a shot off just

1306
01:20:20,641 --> 01:20:25,641
hours before and everybody must have 
been so incredibly brave to try,

1307
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:31,310
but one side would raise themselves up a
little bit and the other side would 

1308
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:32,670
raise themselves up a little bit more 
until both sides.

1309
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:36,840
In this hellish environment where nobody
could go anywhere near,

1310
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:40,800
you know the open air.
We're standing apart from each other,

1311
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:45,870
gazing right at the enemy in no man's 
land on christmas,

1312
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:50,720
private.
William quintin again wrote quote,

1313
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:56,700
as daylight crept in,
we were surprised to see the germans 

1314
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,470
waist high out of their trenches,
gazing across at us with impunity.

1315
01:20:59,770 --> 01:21:02,020
Imagine the position,
whereas yesterday,

1316
01:21:02,021 --> 01:21:07,021
the mere sight of a bit of field gray 
uniform would have caused a dozen 

1317
01:21:07,021 --> 01:21:07,021
british rifles to crack.

1318
01:21:07,021 --> 01:21:11,790
Here was the enemy in full view of us 
gazing serenely across no man's land at 

1319
01:21:12,071 --> 01:21:15,520
us,
and we had him to us in the front line.

1320
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:20,670
The whole world had changed.
We could take stock of our surroundings 

1321
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:21,220
that are leisure.
At 9:00

1322
01:21:21,221 --> 01:21:26,221
precisely,
the german burying party climbed from 

1323
01:21:26,221 --> 01:21:26,680
the trenches,
shovels and picks on their shoulders.

1324
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,040
They advanced about 10 yards in our 
direction and waited.

1325
01:21:30,041 --> 01:21:34,810
Expectedly a word from our company 
officer and our party were soon out.

1326
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:40,170
The officers looked on,
apparently conversing the digging party 

1327
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:41,950
soon lost interest in their task and 
before long we're busy,

1328
01:21:41,951 --> 01:21:46,951
fraternizing cigarettes were being 
exchanged and they seem to be enjoying 

1329
01:21:46,951 --> 01:21:48,550
themselves immensely.
Needless to say,

1330
01:21:48,551 --> 01:21:53,551
before very long,
we in the trenches were soon out on top 

1331
01:21:53,551 --> 01:21:56,820
sauntering about the snow,
but keeping this side of wire 

1332
01:21:56,820 --> 01:21:57,450
entanglements.
Likewise,

1333
01:21:57,451 --> 01:22:02,451
the germans for the whole of that day 
and for many days to come friend and foe

1334
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:07,760
mixed freely out on no man's land,
except for the fact that a few of the 

1335
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:08,370
enemy could speak a little english.

1336
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:11,580
We found the language difficulty,
a bar to conversation,

1337
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:16,820
but we may do with signs and gestures.
I remember distinctly a german holding 

1338
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:19,020
out an open box of chocolates for me to 
take one.

1339
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:22,620
The germans wanted to play a football 
match on no man's land,

1340
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:25,740
but our officers would not allow it and 
the quote,

1341
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:32,150
there are reports though of british and 
german troops engaging in soccer matches

1342
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:37,450
up and down the line.
It was an amazing spontaneous outburst 

1343
01:22:37,671 --> 01:22:42,671
of humanity and it's so appalled the 
higher leadership that they made sure in

1344
01:22:44,841 --> 01:22:47,750
future christmases,
nothing like this would ever be allowed.

1345
01:22:47,751 --> 01:22:52,751
Again,
if you thought the war was bad before 

1346
01:22:52,751 --> 01:22:55,460
it's about to get worse and I'll let 
winston churchill.

1347
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:01,240
He in a leadership position during this 
part of the war setup 1915 a time when 

1348
01:23:03,291 --> 01:23:08,291
he says men lost control of the conflict
and forces took over.

1349
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:11,270
He wrote,
quote,

1350
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:16,980
the year 19,
15 was faded to be disastrous to the 

1351
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:19,420
cause of the allies and the whole world.
By the mistakes of this year,

1352
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:23,440
the opportunity was lost of confining 
the conflagration within limits,

1353
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:26,200
which though enormous we're not 
uncontrolled.

1354
01:23:26,590 --> 01:23:31,590
Thereafter,
the fire roared on until it burned 

1355
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:31,590
itself out.
Thereafter,

1356
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:36,120
events past very largely outside the 
scope of conscious choice governments 

1357
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:40,981
and individuals conformed to the rhythm 
of the tragedy and suede and staggered 

1358
01:23:40,981 --> 01:23:45,931
forward in helpless violence,
slaughtering and squandering on ever 

1359
01:23:45,931 --> 01:23:50,101
increasing scales till injuries were 
brought to the structure of human 

1360
01:23:50,101 --> 01:23:54,121
society,
which a century will not have face and 

1361
01:23:54,121 --> 01:23:55,540
which may conceivably proved fatal to 
the presence civilization.

1362
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:57,670
But in january 19,
15,

1363
01:23:57,970 --> 01:24:00,700
the terrific affair was still not 
unmanageable.

1364
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:05,910
It could have been grasped and human 
hands and brought to rest in righteous 

1365
01:24:05,910 --> 01:24:07,990
and fruitful victory.
Before the world was exhausted,

1366
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:13,230
before the nations were broken,
before the empires were shattered to 

1367
01:24:13,230 --> 01:24:16,921
pieces before europe was ruined,
it was not to be he writes,

1368
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:21,490
mankind was not to escape so easily from
the catastrophe in which it had involved

1369
01:24:21,491 --> 01:24:21,970
itself.

1370
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:25,790
Pride was everywhere to be humbled and 
nowhere to receive it.

1371
01:24:25,791 --> 01:24:30,791
Satisfaction,
no splendid harmony was to crown the 

1372
01:24:30,791 --> 01:24:33,040
wonderful achievements,
no prize to reward the sacrifices of the

1373
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:35,440
combatants.
Victory was to be bought,

1374
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:38,830
so deer has to be almost 
indistinguishable from defeat.

1375
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:41,590
It was not to give even security to the 
victors.

1376
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:46,860
There never was to be the silence 
following the great words of peace to 

1377
01:24:46,860 --> 01:24:48,670
the convulsions of the struggle must 
succeed.

1378
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:53,790
The impotent turmoil of the aftermath,
noble hopes high comradeship and 

1379
01:24:53,831 --> 01:24:58,831
glorious daring.
We're in every nation to lead only to 

1380
01:24:58,831 --> 01:24:58,831
disappointment,
disillusion,

1381
01:24:58,831 --> 01:25:03,810
and frustration.
The sufferings and impoverishment of 

1382
01:25:03,810 --> 01:25:06,130
peoples might arrest their warfare.
The collapse of the defeated might still

1383
01:25:06,131 --> 01:25:11,131
the cannonade,
but their hatreds continue on appeased 

1384
01:25:11,131 --> 01:25:14,230
and their quarrels are still unsettled.
The most complete victory ever gained in

1385
01:25:14,231 --> 01:25:19,231
arms has failed to solve the european 
problem or to remove the dangers which 

1386
01:25:19,231 --> 01:25:22,050
produced the war.
End quote,

1387
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:29,520
the war was entering a new phase.
The phase of stalemate.

1388
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:34,350
What do you do to break the stalemate?

1389
01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:39,110
That Was the main challenge facing 
commanders on all sides.

1390
01:25:39,530 --> 01:25:43,850
As 1915 rolls around and you know later 
in the war,

1391
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:46,940
the allied generals especially will get 
labeled,

1392
01:25:47,220 --> 01:25:52,220
you know,
as butchers and and and blockheads and 

1393
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:55,361
people who can't think their way out of 
a paper bag and and some of it's 

1394
01:25:55,361 --> 01:25:59,441
justified later in the conflict,
but we have to cut them quite a lot of 

1395
01:25:59,441 --> 01:26:02,501
slack early on because as the western 
front in the trench warfare and 

1396
01:26:02,501 --> 01:26:07,001
everything begins to,
all of these generals on all sides are 

1397
01:26:07,001 --> 01:26:08,510
confronted with circumstances that there
are no metrics for.

1398
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:11,720
There is no data on how you deal with 
this.

1399
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:17,020
They have to learn,
they have to experiment and then they 

1400
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:18,350
have to look at the data afterwards.
The problem is is in this conflict,

1401
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:21,500
in the experimentation in this military 
laboratory,

1402
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:26,770
human beings have the lab rats and you 
learn that the cost of human carnage.

1403
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:32,330
Now the allies are more willing to do 
this.

1404
01:26:32,331 --> 01:26:36,620
They have more lab rats to play with and
this becomes a huge feature in the early

1405
01:26:36,621 --> 01:26:40,070
part of 1915 because if you are sir John
French,

1406
01:26:40,071 --> 01:26:45,071
the british commander,
or if you are joseph shaft for the 

1407
01:26:45,071 --> 01:26:46,580
french commander,
you know that if this thing has devolved

1408
01:26:46,581 --> 01:26:49,670
from a wild swinging boxing encounter in
the first round,

1409
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:54,671
just something that's more like a 
wrestling match where both combatants 

1410
01:26:54,671 --> 01:26:56,240
are holding each other in a death grip,
that that works in your favor.

1411
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,330
You're the stronger combatant.
You have more men,

1412
01:26:59,331 --> 01:27:01,670
you have more industrial power.
you control the seas.

1413
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:03,950
If it's going to go that way,
you're going to win.

1414
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:09,250
Now,
you may not want to have to be as hurt 

1415
01:27:09,250 --> 01:27:10,520
as you may have to be to make that work,
but worst case scenario,

1416
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:13,400
long term,
you're going to win that encounter.

1417
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:18,730
It's the german commanders that are 
forced to think outside the box because 

1418
01:27:18,730 --> 01:27:20,720
they're not going to win that encounter.
The problem is,

1419
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:25,310
is the box that they have to think 
outside of is the one that was worked on

1420
01:27:25,311 --> 01:27:30,311
for decades before the first world war 
came out to create laws of war,

1421
01:27:31,430 --> 01:27:34,430
humanitarian restrictions on what you 
could do,

1422
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:37,460
ways to protect civilians,
noncombatants,

1423
01:27:37,461 --> 01:27:39,320
and even combatants from,
you know,

1424
01:27:39,321 --> 01:27:44,030
things that were considered to be 
unsportsmanlike or extra horrific,

1425
01:27:44,031 --> 01:27:49,031
more horrific than it needed to be.
Remember in the first episode we talked 

1426
01:27:49,031 --> 01:27:52,901
about things like the hague conference,
ways to make war conform to 

1427
01:27:52,901 --> 01:27:57,491
international law.
The problem was the germans in the 

1428
01:27:57,491 --> 01:27:59,570
central powers,
we're now in that position that everyone

1429
01:27:59,571 --> 01:28:04,571
kind of knew was going to happen.
You know when you wrote those laws of 

1430
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:08,141
war,
which is they have to decide whether or 

1431
01:28:08,141 --> 01:28:10,451
not adhering to international law is 
worth losing a war over and you begin to

1432
01:28:12,341 --> 01:28:17,341
see both sides try to use asymmetrical 
warfare and new technology to break the 

1433
01:28:19,001 --> 01:28:24,001
stalemate and a lot of what used are the
very things that were prohibited in 

1434
01:28:24,001 --> 01:28:27,991
these prewar agreements.
A perfect example starts in late 1914 

1435
01:28:28,191 --> 01:28:33,191
when german warships open fire on 
british coastal towns kill more than 100

1436
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:35,840
british citizens,
uh,

1437
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:40,870
becomes a wonderful propaganda tool for 
the allies to cite the baby killers of 

1438
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:45,521
Germany.
But that's nothing compared to what's 

1439
01:28:45,521 --> 01:28:47,921
coming in 1915.
The first thing that happens is a 

1440
01:28:47,921 --> 01:28:51,880
absolute benchmark in warfare.
When in january the germans start really

1441
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:58,070
trying to get involved in what we call 
today strategic bombing.

1442
01:28:58,790 --> 01:29:03,790
Now,
aircraft had been in use since the very 

1443
01:29:03,790 --> 01:29:03,790
moment the war started.

1444
01:29:03,790 --> 01:29:07,460
One of the excuses that the germans used
for attacking France was they said that 

1445
01:29:08,731 --> 01:29:12,690
some plane had come from France and 
bombed nurenberg at the very moment that

1446
01:29:12,691 --> 01:29:15,600
the war started,
which is probably nonsense,

1447
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:20,810
but it shows that there were airplanes 
involved in the conflict from the very 

1448
01:29:20,810 --> 01:29:24,201
beginning,
but in ways that really didn't involve 

1449
01:29:24,201 --> 01:29:27,141
the laws of war very much.
I mean all Of the air force's puT 

1450
01:29:27,141 --> 01:29:28,830
together in the world when the war 
started,

1451
01:29:28,831 --> 01:29:33,831
had less than 500 planes.
but what planes they did have turned out

1452
01:29:34,111 --> 01:29:37,080
to be wonderfully valuable tools for 
reconnaissance,

1453
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:42,230
which was what air power had been used 
for earlier than this time.

1454
01:29:42,361 --> 01:29:47,361
Even in the american civil war,
there were hot air balloons that they 

1455
01:29:47,361 --> 01:29:48,390
would use to see what the enemy was 
doing in the distance.

1456
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:53,660
Planes were wonderful for that.
They also turned out to be fantastic in 

1457
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:57,861
the more technologically sophisticated 
armies at what was known as artillery 

1458
01:29:57,861 --> 01:30:02,541
spotting and that allowed your guns to 
shoot at targets that the gunners 

1459
01:30:02,541 --> 01:30:03,300
couldn't see.

1460
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:04,890
You know,
you could shoot,

1461
01:30:04,891 --> 01:30:06,060
for example,
you know,

1462
01:30:06,061 --> 01:30:11,061
far away over a hill and if there was an
airplane there that could tell you what 

1463
01:30:11,061 --> 01:30:14,961
was happening.
And that was interesting enough to try 

1464
01:30:14,961 --> 01:30:15,120
to explain without radios and everything
what was happening.

1465
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:20,390
But they could tell you that your shot 
fell short or went long or was too far 

1466
01:30:20,390 --> 01:30:24,261
to the left or too far to the right.
And this gave a huge advantage to the 

1467
01:30:24,261 --> 01:30:24,810
armies that could make that work for 
them.

1468
01:30:24,811 --> 01:30:27,150
The less sophisticated armies like the 
russians couldn't.

1469
01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:29,640
And hence we're relegated to shooting at
things.

1470
01:30:29,641 --> 01:30:33,330
They could only see it,
but this early on in the fighting,

1471
01:30:33,331 --> 01:30:38,331
you can see how primitive things are 
because early on when aircraft would 

1472
01:30:38,331 --> 01:30:43,251
encounter enemy aircraft,
they didn't have any way to do anything 

1473
01:30:43,251 --> 01:30:45,150
about it.
I mean they were taking hand guns,

1474
01:30:45,151 --> 01:30:50,151
these pilots up in the plane with them 
and trying to take pot shots with their 

1475
01:30:50,151 --> 01:30:50,790
pistols at the enemy air pilots.

1476
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:51,870
I mean,
that's how you know,

1477
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:54,270
sophisticated things are at this stage 
in the war.

1478
01:30:54,690 --> 01:30:59,690
It's only when the germans run up 
against the trench warfare and the 

1479
01:30:59,690 --> 01:31:03,150
western front and they're forced to 
start looking for things that might help

1480
01:31:03,151 --> 01:31:05,940
them break the stalemate that they 
noticed.

1481
01:31:05,941 --> 01:31:08,400
They had the greatest zeplin fleet in 
the world.

1482
01:31:09,190 --> 01:31:12,030
[inaudible] of course are lighter than 
air aircraft,

1483
01:31:12,031 --> 01:31:13,590
like blimps,
dirigibles,

1484
01:31:13,591 --> 01:31:15,690
those kinds of things.
And before the war,

1485
01:31:15,691 --> 01:31:20,691
the germans had built 10 or 12 of them 
and had them sort of sitting aside when 

1486
01:31:20,691 --> 01:31:24,450
the war started,
which scared their enemies probably more

1487
01:31:24,451 --> 01:31:29,451
than they should have.
They sort of had a fleet in being role 

1488
01:31:29,451 --> 01:31:30,090
where people like churchill in britain 
had to be,

1489
01:31:30,350 --> 01:31:32,090
you know,
worried about what are the journals,

1490
01:31:32,091 --> 01:31:34,320
zipline is doing,
what might the german zepplins do.

1491
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:38,640
That was probably out of all proportion 
to what the german zepplins could do.

1492
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:41,670
The germans tried to use them at the 
beginning of the war,

1493
01:31:41,671 --> 01:31:44,640
for example,
when they invaded Belgium and had to try

1494
01:31:44,641 --> 01:31:47,260
to deal with those forts.
A couple of zepplins flew over and tried

1495
01:31:47,261 --> 01:31:52,261
to drop some bombs,
but when the stalemate on the western 

1496
01:31:52,261 --> 01:31:52,261
front reaches its real,
you know,

1497
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:57,500
calcification moment,
the germans start looking for ways to 

1498
01:31:57,500 --> 01:32:00,651
use these tools that they have and there
is no metrics just like there aren't any

1499
01:32:00,761 --> 01:32:03,670
metrics on the western front to try to 
figure out how to break that stalemate.

1500
01:32:03,671 --> 01:32:08,671
There's no metrics that will tell you 
what the zepplins will do if they bomb 

1501
01:32:08,671 --> 01:32:13,020
targets in another country.
There was a british theorist who 

1502
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:15,760
suggested that the very powerlessness 
that people,

1503
01:32:16,090 --> 01:32:19,750
you know in another country in their 
home country feel when the enemy is able

1504
01:32:19,751 --> 01:32:24,520
to with impunity,
fly over your territory and bomb you.

1505
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:28,870
He suggested that if they bombed the 
civilians with confetti,

1506
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,430
it wouldn't make any difference.

1507
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:34,360
It would still damage their morale 
terribly because it's a feeling like you

1508
01:32:34,361 --> 01:32:39,361
can't be defended even at home,
a place that most people tend to feel 

1509
01:32:39,361 --> 01:32:42,490
safe at this stage in military history.
There were people arguing,

1510
01:32:42,670 --> 01:32:44,290
you know,
in the german high command saying,

1511
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:49,000
for all we know these ziplines could win
the war and before the war,

1512
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:54,180
at these big conferences that were part 
of trying to come up with international 

1513
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:54,490
laws of war.
You know,

1514
01:32:54,491 --> 01:32:57,670
there were rules discussed about how 
bombing should work.

1515
01:32:57,671 --> 01:33:02,671
I mean,
should you have to give the city that 

1516
01:33:02,671 --> 01:33:04,531
you're going to bomb a chance to 
surrender before you bombed them and 

1517
01:33:04,531 --> 01:33:06,010
lest you think only the germans were 
doing this.

1518
01:33:06,011 --> 01:33:11,011
Both the british and the french were 
sending small bombing raids over into 

1519
01:33:11,011 --> 01:33:14,791
Germany and Germany was sending small 
bombing raids with aircraft that were 

1520
01:33:14,791 --> 01:33:17,810
holding little hand bombs out of the 
open cockpits and dropping them.

1521
01:33:17,890 --> 01:33:22,890
Nothing significant.
Nothing like sending large numbers of 

1522
01:33:22,890 --> 01:33:26,480
zeppelins all together in bombing raids.
But in january,

1523
01:33:26,481 --> 01:33:31,481
in 1915,
the germans launched their first one of 

1524
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:33,691
those,
they go after some port facilities in 

1525
01:33:33,691 --> 01:33:38,071
britain.
The problem with this is the same 

1526
01:33:38,071 --> 01:33:38,071
problem they're going to have in the 
early second world war,

1527
01:33:38,071 --> 01:33:42,571
which is,
you may say you're trying to hit 

1528
01:33:42,571 --> 01:33:43,300
military targets,
but the accuracy is so terrible.

1529
01:33:43,420 --> 01:33:47,980
You're lucky to fly over a city the size
of london and be able to hit it.

1530
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:52,410
So these poor facilities end up being an
example,

1531
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:54,970
an early example of when civilians get 
hit with these weapons,

1532
01:33:54,971 --> 01:33:58,150
they'll start bombing london in may 19,
15.

1533
01:33:58,570 --> 01:34:03,570
And of course this becomes a propaganda 
victory right away for the allies who 

1534
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:06,970
again labeled the germans baby killers,
which make the germans defensive.

1535
01:34:06,971 --> 01:34:09,310
As you might imagine,
there's a wonderful letter from a german

1536
01:34:09,311 --> 01:34:10,870
zeplin leader,
uh,

1537
01:34:10,871 --> 01:34:15,871
to his mother trying to explain to her 
what apparently he's already tried to 

1538
01:34:15,871 --> 01:34:18,130
explain to her before that this isn't,
you know,

1539
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:20,590
evil stuff,
that this is modern warfaring.

1540
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:21,520
Yes.
It's not like,

1541
01:34:21,521 --> 01:34:23,260
you know,
nights fighting a duel,

1542
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:27,370
but at the same time the situation is 
different than when nights fought duals.

1543
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:32,170
People in the home front are no longer 
innocent in modern warfare.

1544
01:34:32,470 --> 01:34:37,420
They are the ones who make the weapons 
that the soldiers require to fight.

1545
01:34:37,450 --> 01:34:39,790
If the soldiers can't breakthrough on 
the western front,

1546
01:34:39,791 --> 01:34:44,791
what if you could prevent one side from 
building the shells necessary to keep 

1547
01:34:44,791 --> 01:34:48,310
the war going?
This is where the idea of the home front

1548
01:34:48,610 --> 01:34:53,610
first really takes hold and it becomes 
the justification for attacking 

1549
01:34:53,610 --> 01:34:56,440
civilians in other countries.
Here's the letter that the german zeplin

1550
01:34:56,441 --> 01:34:57,680
leader Writes to his mother

1551
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:02,780
trying to make his actions that he 
apparently feels guilty over himself.

1552
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:04,760
Sound morally okay.

1553
01:35:06,890 --> 01:35:11,890
We who strike the enemy where his heart 
beats have been slandered as baby 

1554
01:35:11,890 --> 01:35:16,001
killers and murderers of women.
What we do is repugnant even to us,

1555
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:19,250
but necessary very necessary.
Nowadays.

1556
01:35:19,251 --> 01:35:21,500
There's no such animal as a 
noncombatant.

1557
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:26,770
Modern warfare is total warfare.
A soldier cannot function at the front 

1558
01:35:26,770 --> 01:35:28,580
without the factory worker,
the farmer,

1559
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:31,370
and all the other providers behind him.
You will die.

1560
01:35:31,371 --> 01:35:35,150
Mother have discussed this subject and I
know you understand what I say.

1561
01:35:35,390 --> 01:35:39,110
My man are brave and honorable there 
causes holy.

1562
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:43,040
How can they sin while doing their duty?
If what we do is frightful,

1563
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:47,090
then may frightful be Germany,
salvation end Quote.

1564
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:53,530
This same attitude will be applied to 
the other parts of warfare that rear 

1565
01:35:56,031 --> 01:36:01,010
their ugly head in 1915 because of the 
needs of the situation.

1566
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:06,040
I mean flame throwers are one of the 
technological weapons that will first 

1567
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:06,350
appeared in 1915.
Again,

1568
01:36:06,351 --> 01:36:10,820
using science in ways to try to create 
openings,

1569
01:36:10,821 --> 01:36:14,810
whether it taCtically on the battlefield
or strategically in the war itself.

1570
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:21,760
Another perfect example of this,
when the first world war has to do with 

1571
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,481
anothEr one of these new weapons systems
that challenged age old theories and 

1572
01:36:26,361 --> 01:36:31,361
orthodoxies,
one of them had to do with rules 

1573
01:36:31,361 --> 01:36:33,380
concerning naval blockades.
You see,

1574
01:36:33,381 --> 01:36:38,381
when the first world war breaks out,
the british and the french navy 

1575
01:36:38,381 --> 01:36:39,530
literally sweep the cs clean of german 
shipping,

1576
01:36:39,531 --> 01:36:44,531
Both military and merchant shipping.
this sort of naval blockade was one of 

1577
01:36:45,021 --> 01:36:47,570
the main things that britain could offer
early in the war.

1578
01:36:47,571 --> 01:36:49,880
They certainly weren't going to offer 
millions and millions of troops.

1579
01:36:49,881 --> 01:36:51,440
They didn't have millions and millions 
of troops.

1580
01:36:51,441 --> 01:36:56,441
They had the greatest navy in the world 
and just like in napoleon's time when a 

1581
01:36:56,441 --> 01:36:59,810
strong continental power takes hold,
you shut down their merchant shipping,

1582
01:36:59,811 --> 01:37:04,811
you close their porch.
You don't allow them to get any 

1583
01:37:04,811 --> 01:37:04,811
materials,
resources,

1584
01:37:04,811 --> 01:37:05,030
anything from anyone else.
If you can help.

1585
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:08,300
Now,
there were international laws concerning

1586
01:37:08,301 --> 01:37:10,970
what you were allowed to keep from 
combatants.

1587
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:14,990
You weren't supposed to keep food stops 
or the needs of everyday life.

1588
01:37:14,991 --> 01:37:16,730
You could keep weapons in those kinds of
things,

1589
01:37:16,731 --> 01:37:21,731
but the british and the french push 
those rules way past the boundaries of 

1590
01:37:21,731 --> 01:37:25,061
common sense and we're classifying 
things like cotton fabrics is war 

1591
01:37:25,061 --> 01:37:29,861
necessary materials.
They weren't really going to allow 

1592
01:37:29,861 --> 01:37:29,861
anything through.

1593
01:37:29,861 --> 01:37:32,750
Now,
for all of human history,

1594
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:37,960
there had been sort of a of a calculus 
you could count on and that's the.

1595
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:43,000
The weaker naval power cannot blockade 
the stronger naval power by see,

1596
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:48,460
how could you write your ships?
Tried to blockade a country like great 

1597
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:52,091
britain.
They'll just send their navy out and 

1598
01:37:52,091 --> 01:37:52,940
sweep your ships off the sea.
But what if your ships aren't on the c?

1599
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:58,750
What if the ships that are trying to 
blockade an island nation like britain 

1600
01:37:58,750 --> 01:38:02,751
or instead under the sea,
the germans had some marines,

1601
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:08,040
this was not a brand new invention,
but one that had finally reached a stage

1602
01:38:08,041 --> 01:38:13,041
of effectiveness where the british were 
to find out that the old naval 

1603
01:38:13,051 --> 01:38:18,051
orthodoxies about what a weaker naval 
power could and couldn't do had changed.

1604
01:38:19,470 --> 01:38:23,760
There was no answer at this point in 
history to the submarine surface.

1605
01:38:23,761 --> 01:38:27,570
Vessels could not detect them,
and unless the submarine surfaced,

1606
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:28,680
they couldn't destroy them.

1607
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:34,520
Now,
Germany had a lot less submarines than 

1608
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:34,520
britain and France,
but here's the thing.

1609
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:36,030
Britain and France couldn't do anything 
with their submarines.

1610
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:40,140
They couldn't use their submarines 
against german merchant shipping because

1611
01:38:40,141 --> 01:38:42,060
there wasn't any german merchant 
shipping.

1612
01:38:42,061 --> 01:38:43,920
About five minutes after the war breaks 
out,

1613
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:46,890
the surface fleets of France and britain
saw to that,

1614
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:52,820
but germany's surface fleet,
which was one of the things that had 

1615
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:56,180
precipitated the war,
one of the many causes that's always 

1616
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:58,761
cited as the naval arms race between 
britain and Germany stayed in port.

1617
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:03,891
For the most part.
Neither british nor the germans were 

1618
01:39:03,891 --> 01:39:06,921
willing to risk these enormously 
expensive and hard to replace surface 

1619
01:39:07,801 --> 01:39:10,440
ships that were the what are called 
capital ships,

1620
01:39:10,441 --> 01:39:15,441
battleships,
the really unbelievably expensive 

1621
01:39:15,441 --> 01:39:15,441
lenses.
For example,

1622
01:39:15,441 --> 01:39:17,580
the british had just commissioned to 
class ships known as the queen elizabeth

1623
01:39:17,581 --> 01:39:22,581
class of battleships,
which were so good in the first world 

1624
01:39:22,581 --> 01:39:22,581
war.

1625
01:39:22,581 --> 01:39:23,130
They'd still be very effective units in 
the second world war,

1626
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:28,170
but if a cheap little submarine could 
sink one of those ships with a torpedo,

1627
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:32,250
that's nothing that any naval commanders
were willing to risk,

1628
01:39:32,251 --> 01:39:37,251
and so all of a sudden,
everybody's being so careful with their 

1629
01:39:37,251 --> 01:39:38,610
big ships that it leaves openings for 
the little ships to make a difference.

1630
01:39:39,540 --> 01:39:44,540
Everyone thought at the beginning of the
war that these submarines would be used 

1631
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:48,111
in the military sense against other 
warships by february 19 slash 15.

1632
01:39:49,020 --> 01:39:54,020
The germans are now using them against 
merchant shipping and all of a sudden 

1633
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:57,591
the greatest navy in the world finds 
that they can't defend their merchant 

1634
01:39:57,591 --> 01:39:58,680
shipping because of a new technological 
creation.

1635
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:03,860
We're weAker.
Naval power has the potential to turn 

1636
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:06,921
the tables on the best weapon that the 
great naval powers have blockading 

1637
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:12,800
weaker naval powers and the british who 
are doing a very good job of keeping 

1638
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:17,271
goods and weapons from flowing into 
Germany by sea are finding out that the 

1639
01:40:17,271 --> 01:40:19,440
germans had the capability to do the 
same thing back to them.

1640
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:24,630
Now the big issue will surface,
if you'll pardon the pun,

1641
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:30,080
around whether or not the warfare should
follow the old famous rules of the ce or

1642
01:40:31,141 --> 01:40:36,141
not.
The old famous rules of the c word that 

1643
01:40:36,141 --> 01:40:37,030
you didn't destroy,
you know,

1644
01:40:37,350 --> 01:40:42,210
merchant shipping nonmilitary vessels 
without letting them know that's piracy.

1645
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:45,870
You basically are supposed to give them 
a message and say,

1646
01:40:45,871 --> 01:40:50,871
we're seizing your ship.
Let them take their people off the ship 

1647
01:40:50,871 --> 01:40:53,961
on lifeboats and stuff,
and then you can either sink the vessel 

1648
01:40:53,961 --> 01:40:55,480
that you were after or you can take it 
as a prize and Capture it.

1649
01:40:56,020 --> 01:40:58,690
The problem is,
when the submarines tried to do this,

1650
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:03,010
it opened them up to being destroyed and
the british played this up.

1651
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:05,110
They started putting guns on all these 
merchant ships.

1652
01:41:05,410 --> 01:41:08,350
So if the germans came up and did what 
they were supposed to do,

1653
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:11,560
tell the merchant ship were captured 
your prize of war.

1654
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:16,560
Now get your life boats out,
get your people off the ship and we'll 

1655
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:19,321
sync it.
They'd often pull the canvas off a gun 

1656
01:41:19,321 --> 01:41:20,410
and starts shooting at the now 
vulnerable submarine because it had,

1657
01:41:20,411 --> 01:41:23,920
had to surface in order to comply with 
the international laws of war,

1658
01:41:23,921 --> 01:41:28,921
right to the germans were having these 
debates in 1915 about whether or not 

1659
01:41:29,861 --> 01:41:34,861
they should do that at all.
Maybe they should just sink these 

1660
01:41:34,861 --> 01:41:36,880
vessels without surfacing or warning 
them or anything.

1661
01:41:37,240 --> 01:41:39,670
But this again would look like the 
germans were,

1662
01:41:40,100 --> 01:41:45,100
you know,
the ones outside international law were 

1663
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:47,200
the ones who were the bad guys.
And worse than that,

1664
01:41:47,650 --> 01:41:52,650
they risked alienating neutral powers.
The most important of which was the 

1665
01:41:52,650 --> 01:41:53,560
United States,
which was a very,

1666
01:41:54,120 --> 01:41:56,860
um,
know maritime power,

1667
01:41:57,070 --> 01:41:59,470
huge into trade.
And by the way,

1668
01:41:59,471 --> 01:42:04,471
at this point in the war,
if you wanted to say who's gaining from 

1669
01:42:04,471 --> 01:42:07,501
the first world war,
it's the United States because one of 

1670
01:42:07,501 --> 01:42:10,951
the things that all these powers do when
they find out they can't produce enough 

1671
01:42:10,951 --> 01:42:12,430
shells and weapons and war materials to 
keep the war going,

1672
01:42:12,910 --> 01:42:17,910
is borrow money from the United States 
and then turn around and spend that 

1673
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:21,571
borrowed money on stuff and production 
from the United States often called the 

1674
01:42:22,331 --> 01:42:23,230
great neutral.

1675
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:28,620
The United States just wants to be able 
to keep delivering their stuff where it 

1676
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:31,891
has to go.
They're already getting tense with the 

1677
01:42:31,891 --> 01:42:31,891
british,
you know,

1678
01:42:31,891 --> 01:42:33,470
searching their ships and saying that 
this shipper,

1679
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:35,440
that ship can dock at this porter,
that port.

1680
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:38,890
But when the germans start sinking 
merchant vessels,

1681
01:42:39,130 --> 01:42:42,220
sometimes those merchant vessels have 
americans on them.

1682
01:42:42,790 --> 01:42:47,790
In early 1915,
one of those vessels was called the 

1683
01:42:47,790 --> 01:42:48,250
lusitania.
The lusitania,

1684
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:50,170
if you want to think of it,
you know,

1685
01:42:50,171 --> 01:42:54,700
to conceptualize what we're talking 
about here is very much like the titanic

1686
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:59,140
and extremely large ocean liner,
a passenger ship.

1687
01:42:59,170 --> 01:43:01,210
This is how people got from the old 
world,

1688
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:06,250
the new world,
and back again across the atlantic in 

1689
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:06,250
the days before transatlantic air 
flight.

1690
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:11,820
Now,
controversy has raged ever since the 

1691
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:14,380
german submarine,
which opened fire on the lusitania,

1692
01:43:14,381 --> 01:43:18,430
sank that ship on whether or not he was 
a legitimate target of war.

1693
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:20,890
They did have munitions.
If it did,

1694
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:24,560
supposedly they could sync it.
There's a lot of evidence that suggested

1695
01:43:24,580 --> 01:43:29,580
did and some conspiracy theories out 
there that suggests that people like 

1696
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:33,361
winston churchill assured that it did so
that it would be another nail in the 

1697
01:43:33,611 --> 01:43:38,611
coffin he was starting to construct that
would eventually get the United States 

1698
01:43:38,611 --> 01:43:41,911
into the war.
More than 100 americans were on the 

1699
01:43:41,911 --> 01:43:43,921
lusitania and died when it went down at 
various times in the war,

1700
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:49,180
the germans would start up what was 
called unrestricted submarine warfare,

1701
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:54,420
where they shot at anything that looked 
like enemy ship of any kind and other 

1702
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:57,020
times where they would stop because 
there was a huge debate within the halls

1703
01:43:57,021 --> 01:44:02,021
of german leadership over whether or not
they gained more or last more when they 

1704
01:44:02,021 --> 01:44:03,890
did this.
If the United States comes into the war,

1705
01:44:03,980 --> 01:44:08,980
it's a huge loss,
but it's one of the few ways that in 

1706
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:12,341
1915 they can see that they can bring 
britain to its knees.

1707
01:44:13,070 --> 01:44:18,070
They can starve that island in ways that
the british never could have imagined 

1708
01:44:18,070 --> 01:44:22,361
before the war because before the war 
they thought you had to have a bigger 

1709
01:44:22,361 --> 01:44:25,781
navy to do that.
Technology had turned the tables on the 

1710
01:44:25,781 --> 01:44:26,510
greatest naval power in history.

1711
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:33,580
The perhaps the most iconic asymmetrical
warfare of this period has to do with 

1712
01:44:36,051 --> 01:44:38,300
something that was a big worry at the 
hague.

1713
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:41,180
Conferences in the late 18 hundreds and 
early 19 hundreds.

1714
01:44:42,110 --> 01:44:47,110
Something that shows the desperation of 
the germans at this stage in the war 

1715
01:44:47,421 --> 01:44:52,421
that they would resort to this.
It involves the use of what the hague 

1716
01:44:52,421 --> 01:44:56,030
conference called asphyxiating gases.

1717
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:02,920
Everyone had realized by the late 18 
hundreds that the modern chemical 

1718
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:04,550
industry is.
We would recognize it today,

1719
01:45:04,551 --> 01:45:09,551
had come of age mean there were all 
sorts of explosive gunpowders and 

1720
01:45:09,551 --> 01:45:13,631
everything that we're so much more 
explosive than had been the case in 

1721
01:45:13,631 --> 01:45:15,950
napoleon's time,
less than a century beforehand.

1722
01:45:15,951 --> 01:45:18,050
So everyone was aware of the 
possibilities,

1723
01:45:18,590 --> 01:45:23,590
but gunpowder and explosives were just 
more powerful versions of weapons that 

1724
01:45:23,590 --> 01:45:27,941
had been used for a very long time.
The chemical industry made possible the 

1725
01:45:27,941 --> 01:45:30,740
use of weapons that had never been used 
and that no one knew.

1726
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:33,140
You know,
what the effects if they were used,

1727
01:45:33,141 --> 01:45:38,141
would be.
And so with the hague conference in 

1728
01:45:38,141 --> 01:45:38,141
1899,
the issue was addressed.

1729
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:43,520
The conference outlawed the use of 
poison or poisoned weapons,

1730
01:45:43,790 --> 01:45:48,790
arms projectiles or material calculated 
to cause unnecessary suffering and 

1731
01:45:49,971 --> 01:45:54,971
projectiles designed for the diffusion 
of is fixating or deleterious gases and 

1732
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:58,520
to quote.
But in 1915,

1733
01:45:58,860 --> 01:46:03,860
Germany is looking at all these laws of 
war through a completely different lens 

1734
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:08,770
as we said,
the tradeoff between follow 

1735
01:46:08,770 --> 01:46:08,770
international law or lose the war.

1736
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:12,020
What's more,
they're dealing with this front.

1737
01:46:12,021 --> 01:46:15,920
As we sat on the western front that had 
solidified in interesting ways.

1738
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:19,010
As we said,
you have a continuous trench system from

1739
01:46:19,011 --> 01:46:22,880
the swiss border all the way you know,
up to the ocean.

1740
01:46:23,810 --> 01:46:28,810
And the interesting part is a lot of 
that territory is not really good 

1741
01:46:29,001 --> 01:46:31,970
fighting ground.
A lot of it's to marshy.

1742
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:37,000
A lot of it's to forest did a lot of it.
The germans are in such an amazingly 

1743
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,570
strong position.
You'd be an idiot to challenge them,

1744
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:43,870
which leaves the same few spots as good 
areas to launch offensive,

1745
01:46:44,980 --> 01:46:46,070
you know,
campaigns,

1746
01:46:46,610 --> 01:46:51,610
which means that those areas become the 
most horrific battlefields in human 

1747
01:46:51,931 --> 01:46:56,931
history because they basically don't 
move very much for the entire war and 

1748
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:02,600
the same ground is plowed up by 
artillery shells over and over again.

1749
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:08,420
The people that die in,
some of these places are never buried 

1750
01:47:08,420 --> 01:47:12,950
and so you have a charnel house of 
horrors of people who have just been 

1751
01:47:13,531 --> 01:47:14,490
killed the other day.

1752
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:17,550
People that were killed a month ago,
people that were killed a year ago,

1753
01:47:17,610 --> 01:47:21,750
all in the same spot and you as the 
soldier have to live in this environment

1754
01:47:22,710 --> 01:47:25,530
and that of course ignores the more 
mundane aspects,

1755
01:47:25,531 --> 01:47:30,150
which is if you are trapped in a trench 
and you can't move without being shot,

1756
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:34,230
where do you go to the bathroom?
I mean early on in the combat,

1757
01:47:34,530 --> 01:47:39,530
british soldiers were talking about 
taking the german helmets with the 

1758
01:47:39,530 --> 01:47:41,760
spikes on them as souvenirs for the war,
but quickly realized that the best thing

1759
01:47:41,761 --> 01:47:46,761
you could do with those things is used 
them as a receptacle for the call of 

1760
01:47:46,761 --> 01:47:51,201
nature and then toss it as far away from
the trenches possible so that the smell 

1761
01:47:51,201 --> 01:47:54,921
of thousands of men doing this in a 
confined space over years doesn't 

1762
01:47:55,531 --> 01:47:56,610
overwhelm you.
As We said,

1763
01:47:56,611 --> 01:48:01,611
certain battlegrounds like ipa will 
become famous for their smell and you 

1764
01:48:01,611 --> 01:48:03,900
will be able to smell them before you 
get anywhere near them.

1765
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:09,920
The canadians are arrivinG in early 1915
in numbers and they take over some of 

1766
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:14,640
these battlefields.
You know where nothing has changed.

1767
01:48:14,641 --> 01:48:17,070
I mean no one's gone out and buried 
anybody.

1768
01:48:17,071 --> 01:48:18,240
That was one of the things,
by the way,

1769
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:23,241
during the christmas truce is that we 
talked about that was the number one 

1770
01:48:23,241 --> 01:48:27,111
thing both sides tried to do,
which tells you how crazy the smell and 

1771
01:48:27,111 --> 01:48:27,690
the situation and now horrifying it must
have been,

1772
01:48:27,691 --> 01:48:32,691
but they jump out of these trenches and 
start to try to bury these bodies that 

1773
01:48:32,691 --> 01:48:36,221
have been out there for months.
Canadian soldier on the western front 

1774
01:48:36,221 --> 01:48:40,470
arriving at the trenches of eat in early
1915 trenches that had been occupied by 

1775
01:48:41,380 --> 01:48:46,380
the grca forces from around India and a 
canadian sergeant name sv britain 

1776
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:50,610
describes his,
you know,

1777
01:48:50,611 --> 01:48:55,410
welcome to the western front in suitably
horrific terms.

1778
01:48:55,950 --> 01:48:56,910
He says,
quote,

1779
01:48:58,050 --> 01:49:03,050
left at 6:30
PM for reserve trenches and reached our 

1780
01:49:03,050 --> 01:49:05,880
reserved dugouts via st julian just rat 
holes.

1781
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:11,000
One hell of an accommodation.
Got to the trenches as a fatigue party 

1782
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,220
with steak and sandbags,
and though there were reserved trenches,

1783
01:49:14,430 --> 01:49:17,670
they were so rotten.
No trenches at all in parts,

1784
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:22,700
just isolated mounds,
found germans feet sticking up through 

1785
01:49:22,700 --> 01:49:27,111
the ground.
The gurkhas had actually used human 

1786
01:49:27,111 --> 01:49:29,400
bodies instead of sandbags right beside 
the stream where we were working,

1787
01:49:29,610 --> 01:49:33,300
where the bodies of two dead since 
november last one,

1788
01:49:33,301 --> 01:49:36,930
face downward in full marching order 
with this kit on his back.

1789
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:41,960
He died game stench,
something awful and dead all around 

1790
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:46,820
water rats had made a home of their 
decomposed bodies visiting the barb wire

1791
01:49:46,891 --> 01:49:50,050
with ray,
ordinary wire strung across,

1792
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:51,910
quit about 1:00
AM,

1793
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,730
came back to our dugouts and found them 
on fire.

1794
01:49:54,970 --> 01:49:58,900
Had to march out to st julien and put up
in a roofless house,

1795
01:49:59,200 --> 01:50:01,690
not a roof left on anything in the whole
place.

1796
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:05,260
Found our sack of food had been stolen,
and we were famished.

1797
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:10,590
Certainly a most unlucky day for I lost 
my cherished pipe bed at 4:00

1798
01:50:10,990 --> 01:50:12,010
AM and quote,

1799
01:50:13,970 --> 01:50:15,950
well,
if the canadians thought the battlefield

1800
01:50:16,250 --> 01:50:20,450
and the traditional aspects of what war 
had already come to be by that time were

1801
01:50:20,451 --> 01:50:25,451
as bad as it was going to get.
They were frightfully mistaken for at 

1802
01:50:25,451 --> 01:50:25,451
this battle.
That will be called.

1803
01:50:25,451 --> 01:50:30,251
The second battle of ipa is the first 
time that a major gas attack happens and

1804
01:50:32,541 --> 01:50:37,541
the canadians will be the reason that it
doesn't turn out to be a huge tragedy 

1805
01:50:38,031 --> 01:50:43,031
for the allied cause.
The other reason will be that the 

1806
01:50:43,031 --> 01:50:45,320
germans had no idea that their attack 
was going to be this successful and this

1807
01:50:45,321 --> 01:50:48,050
becomes a pattern with all this new 
technology.

1808
01:50:48,470 --> 01:50:53,470
Very often the commanders are trying to 
figure out whether this new technology 

1809
01:50:53,861 --> 01:50:55,970
is going to be something that's 
effective and useful,

1810
01:50:56,150 --> 01:51:00,080
so they try it out on a small scale,
not really expecting to make good use of

1811
01:51:00,081 --> 01:51:03,500
it and because of the sheer shock of the
new stuff,

1812
01:51:04,070 --> 01:51:09,070
it proves wonderfully effective,
but it can't be exploited because the 

1813
01:51:09,070 --> 01:51:11,830
generals who authorized it's use hadn't 
planned to explore it.

1814
01:51:11,831 --> 01:51:14,420
If they were hoping to test it out a 
little bit and then if it was good,

1815
01:51:14,421 --> 01:51:17,750
they'll use it later,
but by the time later Comes around,

1816
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:20,210
the other side has figured out 
countermeasurEs.

1817
01:51:20,450 --> 01:51:24,860
Gas worked exactly like that.
Then before it was used,

1818
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:28,280
the german high command,
just as they did with submarine warfare,

1819
01:51:28,550 --> 01:51:31,040
debated whether or not this was a good 
thing intensely.

1820
01:51:33,010 --> 01:51:36,220
As we said,
there were all these laws that the hague

1821
01:51:36,221 --> 01:51:38,650
conference had sat down saying you 
couldn't use this stuff,

1822
01:51:39,340 --> 01:51:41,890
and some of the german leaders had said,
we sign these papers,

1823
01:51:41,891 --> 01:51:44,860
and others had found little loopholes 
like legal loopholes that said,

1824
01:51:44,861 --> 01:51:46,630
well,
it said we couldn't use shovels,

1825
01:51:46,631 --> 01:51:50,320
but nothing said anything about just 
taking the lids off of,

1826
01:51:50,580 --> 01:51:55,580
you know,
containers that had chlorine gas in 

1827
01:51:55,580 --> 01:51:55,580
them.

1828
01:51:56,250 --> 01:52:01,250
Historian eric dorm burroughs writes,
quote the same kind of murderously cold 

1829
01:52:01,651 --> 01:52:06,651
war time mentality that would terminate 
1200 civilians aboard the lusitania two 

1830
01:52:06,841 --> 01:52:09,330
weeks later did not allow.
However,

1831
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:14,480
for respect of international law,
german legal experts advised general 

1832
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:19,101
falcon hein,
that the attack could be justified 

1833
01:52:19,101 --> 01:52:19,101
because the gas was released from 
containers.

1834
01:52:19,110 --> 01:52:24,110
In fact,
just to save artillery shells and not 

1835
01:52:24,110 --> 01:52:24,750
from projectiles.
On the other side of the debate,

1836
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:30,020
duke albert avert and commander of the 
sixth army argued that unleashing this 

1837
01:52:30,020 --> 01:52:34,170
new weapon would not only be a moral but
also with dubious military value.

1838
01:52:34,350 --> 01:52:39,350
For the allies with the wind,
normally at their backs would probably 

1839
01:52:39,350 --> 01:52:41,490
send 10 times as much gas onto german 
positions.

1840
01:52:41,790 --> 01:52:46,790
Karl von item of the third army agreed 
and then additional worries over the 

1841
01:52:46,790 --> 01:52:51,641
quote,
tremendous scandal and quote that would 

1842
01:52:51,641 --> 01:52:52,550
compromise in disgrace Germany in the 
eyes of the world.

1843
01:52:53,470 --> 01:52:56,150
War haS nothing to do with chivalry 
anymore.

1844
01:52:56,151 --> 01:52:58,820
He wrote,
the higher civilization rises,

1845
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:04,000
the more vile man becomes and quote,
if anybody still had any of those old 

1846
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:11,120
19th century,
truly going back to ancient times,

1847
01:53:11,510 --> 01:53:16,490
versions of the romantic glorious,
heroic dual that they had been raised to

1848
01:53:16,491 --> 01:53:21,491
believe that war was operation.
Disinfectant will cure them of such 

1849
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:28,810
ills.
That will be the german name for the 

1850
01:53:28,810 --> 01:53:31,481
program and the code word to start the 
operation will be god punish england.

1851
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:39,760
The operation involves almost 6,000
cylinders containing chlorine gas,

1852
01:53:41,121 --> 01:53:46,121
a byproduct of the German dye 
manufacturing industry that the germans 

1853
01:53:46,121 --> 01:53:47,360
had planted in the soil carefully over 
time,

1854
01:53:47,361 --> 01:53:51,260
around the battlefield that ether in 
August,

1855
01:53:51,260 --> 01:53:56,260
1915,
they took the tops off the containers 

1856
01:53:56,260 --> 01:53:58,780
when the wind was right and let the 
chlorine gas blow across the battlefield

1857
01:53:59,481 --> 01:54:04,481
toward the allied trenches.
Which were occupied by french algerian 

1858
01:54:04,701 --> 01:54:08,030
forces which involve both french troops 
and Algeria and troops,

1859
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:11,510
and also the newly arrived canadian 
forces.

1860
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:17,440
They didn't know what to make of this,
but they figured out pretty quickly it 

1861
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:22,121
was hell on earth as one indian soldier 
would write his father afterwards.

1862
01:54:22,940 --> 01:54:25,880
This isn't war.
This is the end of the world.

1863
01:54:26,930 --> 01:54:31,930
The end of the world to some of these 
people at the second battle of ipa 

1864
01:54:31,930 --> 01:54:36,580
looked like a cloud of greenish yellow 
gas that was floating across the 

1865
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:40,460
battlefield so slowly you could actually
walk ahead of it,

1866
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:43,640
but because these soldiers didn't know 
what they were looking at,

1867
01:54:43,641 --> 01:54:46,310
most of them didn't move until it hit 
them.

1868
01:54:47,810 --> 01:54:50,480
Again.
Historian eric dorn bros quote,

1869
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:56,520
stretching 6,000
meters along opposing lines and 

1870
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:57,520
bellowing high up into the air.
A thick,

1871
01:54:57,550 --> 01:55:02,550
ghastly looking green.
Yellow cloud of gas moved eerily and 

1872
01:55:02,550 --> 01:55:04,150
threateningly with the breeze across no 
man's land.

1873
01:55:04,540 --> 01:55:08,380
The gassiest monstrosity took on a 
pinkish hue from certain angles.

1874
01:55:08,620 --> 01:55:11,260
As the descending western sun shone 
through it.

1875
01:55:11,650 --> 01:55:16,090
To compound the shock and terror,
german heavy artillery began to lay down

1876
01:55:16,091 --> 01:55:19,600
a pounding barrage to french colonial 
divisions.

1877
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:22,780
And a canadian division were caught 
completely unaware.

1878
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:24,650
Quote,
take a look at this.

1879
01:55:24,651 --> 01:55:29,651
Sir said one canadian artillery observer
to his superior as he stared through 

1880
01:55:29,651 --> 01:55:30,970
binoculars,
it was coming towards them.

1881
01:55:31,330 --> 01:55:36,330
There's something funny going on when he
dove for cover from the incoming shells,

1882
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:41,930
but just then the wind shifted 
compressing the gas cloud over the 

1883
01:55:41,930 --> 01:55:45,450
algerian who's forward units were the 
soldiers grabbed their throats,

1884
01:55:45,660 --> 01:55:50,660
choking and riding in excruciating pain 
from the searing chlorine gas in 

1885
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:55,431
minutes.
Many hundreds laid drowning in fluids 

1886
01:55:55,431 --> 01:55:57,060
given off by the lungs.
Seeing this others panicked,

1887
01:55:57,300 --> 01:56:02,300
drop their rifles and ran,
leaving a six kilometer gap in the line 

1888
01:56:02,300 --> 01:56:07,130
and quote private william quintin,
a british soldier experience his first 

1889
01:56:10,071 --> 01:56:14,210
gas attack only about a week after the 
first time it had been used.

1890
01:56:14,810 --> 01:56:16,760
That affair had caused

1891
01:56:17,750 --> 01:56:22,750
the high command to tell the troops to 
soak flannel in water and just put it 

1892
01:56:22,750 --> 01:56:27,641
over their noses is a cheap,
easy attempt to try to forestall the 

1893
01:56:27,641 --> 01:56:31,871
gas.
But none of these soldiers knew what 

1894
01:56:31,871 --> 01:56:31,871
they were facing until they actually,
you know,

1895
01:56:31,871 --> 01:56:35,840
had a gas attack hit them.
Which quintin had hit him on May 1st 19,

1896
01:56:35,841 --> 01:56:39,350
15 quote.
Suddenly over the top of our front line,

1897
01:56:39,620 --> 01:56:44,620
we saw what looked like clouds of thin 
gray smoke rolling slowly along with a 

1898
01:56:44,620 --> 01:56:45,700
slight wind.
It hung,

1899
01:56:45,701 --> 01:56:50,701
did the ground reaching to the height of
eight or nine feet and approached so 

1900
01:56:50,701 --> 01:56:51,920
slowly that a man walking could have 
kept ahead of it.

1901
01:56:52,280 --> 01:56:55,910
Gas the word quickly passed round even 
now,

1902
01:56:55,911 --> 01:57:00,911
it had no terror for us,
for we had not yet tasted it from our 

1903
01:57:00,911 --> 01:57:02,690
hammer stacks.
We hastily drew the flannel belts,

1904
01:57:02,780 --> 01:57:07,780
soak them in water,
and tied them around our mouths and 

1905
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:07,780
noses.

1906
01:57:07,780 --> 01:57:09,920
Suddenly through the communication 
trench came rushing.

1907
01:57:09,921 --> 01:57:14,270
A few khaki clad figures,
their eyes glaring out of their heads,

1908
01:57:14,570 --> 01:57:17,510
their hands tearing at their throats as 
they came on,

1909
01:57:17,630 --> 01:57:20,870
some stumbled and fell and lay writhing 
at the bottom of the trench.

1910
01:57:21,050 --> 01:57:24,650
Choking and gasping will those following
trampled over them.

1911
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:29,920
If ever men were raving mad with terror,
these men were what was left of our 

1912
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:31,700
section.
Still crouched at the support end of the

1913
01:57:31,701 --> 01:57:36,701
communication trench are frontline.
Judging from the number of men who just 

1914
01:57:36,701 --> 01:57:40,481
come from,
it had been abandoned and we now waited 

1915
01:57:40,481 --> 01:57:41,390
for the first rush of germans,
but they did not come.

1916
01:57:41,750 --> 01:57:46,750
Our biggest enemy was now within a few 
yards of us and in the form of a cloud 

1917
01:57:46,750 --> 01:57:48,110
of gas.
We caught our first whiff of it.

1918
01:57:48,350 --> 01:57:53,350
No words of mine can ever describe my 
feelings as we inhaled the first 

1919
01:57:53,350 --> 01:57:53,870
mouthful.
We choked,

1920
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:55,280
spit and coughed.

1921
01:57:55,490 --> 01:57:57,800
My lungs felt as though they were being 
burnt out,

1922
01:57:58,010 --> 01:58:03,010
that they were going to burst.
Red hot needles were being thrust into 

1923
01:58:03,010 --> 01:58:04,100
my eyes.
The first impulse Was to run.

1924
01:58:04,490 --> 01:58:09,490
We had just seen men running to certain 
death and knew it rather than stay and 

1925
01:58:09,490 --> 01:58:11,030
be choked into a slow and agonizing 
death.

1926
01:58:11,390 --> 01:58:14,210
It was one of those occasions when you 
do not know what you were doing.

1927
01:58:14,540 --> 01:58:17,510
The men who stayed was no braver than 
the man who ran away.

1928
01:58:17,810 --> 01:58:19,850
We crouched.
They're terrified.

1929
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:23,120
Stupefied a large shell burst on the 
pair of pitt.

1930
01:58:23,330 --> 01:58:28,330
Just where we were sheltered.
We were almost buried beneath the 

1931
01:58:28,330 --> 01:58:28,550
falling earth.
Young addington,

1932
01:58:28,610 --> 01:58:33,610
a chap about my own age was screaming at
the top of his voice and trying to free 

1933
01:58:33,610 --> 01:58:37,901
his buried legs.
He got free and before we could stop 

1934
01:58:37,901 --> 01:58:37,901
him,
he rushed off.

1935
01:58:37,901 --> 01:58:40,280
God knows where we then saw the reason 
for his screams.

1936
01:58:40,430 --> 01:58:45,430
His left was blown off above the elbow.
He left a trail of blood over my tunic 

1937
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:49,290
as he climbed over me in a mad rush to 
get away and to quote

1938
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:56,120
quintin and his unit of canadians will 
block heroically in the hole that 

1939
01:58:56,131 --> 01:58:58,920
develops in the line keeping the germans
from breaking through.

1940
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:04,280
Of course,
the germans hadn't expected to break 

1941
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:06,411
through.
The entire reason for this gas attack 

1942
01:59:06,411 --> 01:59:09,171
was to experiment with the gas and to 
cover the fact that the germans were 

1943
01:59:09,171 --> 01:59:10,980
removing troops for use on the eastern 
front.

1944
01:59:11,430 --> 01:59:16,430
The german high command had no idea it 
was going to be this successful and no 

1945
01:59:16,430 --> 01:59:18,150
one had any idea how horrifying it was 
going to be.

1946
01:59:18,420 --> 01:59:23,420
Private.
William quintin and his unit will move 

1947
01:59:23,420 --> 01:59:25,431
up to the front line and will experience
the aftermath of what the gas attack did

1948
01:59:26,311 --> 01:59:28,320
to the people who first encountered it.
He wrote,

1949
01:59:28,321 --> 01:59:33,321
quote black in the face,
their tunics and shirt fronts torn open 

1950
01:59:33,321 --> 01:59:37,881
at the next,
in their last desperate fight for 

1951
01:59:37,881 --> 01:59:39,921
breath.
Many of them quite still while others 

1952
01:59:39,921 --> 01:59:42,921
were still wriggling and kicking in the 
agonies of the most awful death I've 

1953
01:59:42,921 --> 01:59:46,371
ever seen.
Some were wounded in the bargain and 

1954
01:59:46,371 --> 01:59:46,371
they're gaping wounds.
Lay open.

1955
01:59:46,590 --> 01:59:50,670
Blood's still oozing from them.
One poor devil was tearing at his throat

1956
01:59:50,671 --> 01:59:55,671
with his hands.
I doubt if he knew or felt that he had 

1957
01:59:55,671 --> 01:59:59,271
only one hand and that the other was 
just a stump where the hand should have 

1958
01:59:59,271 --> 02:00:03,111
been this stump.
He worked around his throat as if his 

1959
02:00:03,111 --> 02:00:06,261
hand was still there and the blood from 
it was streaming over his bluish black 

1960
02:00:06,261 --> 02:00:07,470
face and neck.
A few minutes later,

1961
02:00:07,471 --> 02:00:12,471
he was still except for occasional 
shutters as he breathed his last and 

1962
02:00:12,471 --> 02:00:12,750
quote,

1963
02:00:15,630 --> 02:00:19,350
as I've said before in this program,
and I think I will say many times more.

1964
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:25,280
This is the most horrifying sustained 
situation of terribleness I've ever seen

1965
02:00:28,201 --> 02:00:33,201
soldiers forced to endure and millions 
and millions of people will get to 

1966
02:00:33,481 --> 02:00:35,760
experience this before the end of the 
conflict.

1967
02:00:36,210 --> 02:00:41,210
My own grandfather would be gassed on 
the western front and he was never the 

1968
02:00:41,210 --> 02:00:45,351
same afterwards.
The use of poison gas is a defining 

1969
02:00:46,931 --> 02:00:51,931
moment in this conflict,
one that puts the final end stamp on the

1970
02:00:52,001 --> 02:00:55,540
19th century victorian romantic ideals 
of warfare.

1971
02:00:55,600 --> 02:00:58,780
You can't pretend anymore when human 
beings are being treated.

1972
02:00:59,210 --> 02:01:04,210
You know the way you would treat ants 
with a can of raid or some other 

1973
02:01:04,210 --> 02:01:08,560
insecticide even before gases used the 
times of london,

1974
02:01:09,451 --> 02:01:12,600
the great paper in britain.
In November,

1975
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:17,600
1914,
we'll run an article which seems amazing

1976
02:01:17,851 --> 02:01:22,851
by modern standards,
but of course we're in a post first and 

1977
02:01:22,851 --> 02:01:25,911
second world war era now.
Those people were coming into this 

1978
02:01:25,911 --> 02:01:29,421
conflict with certain ideals and 
understandings of what war was going to 

1979
02:01:29,421 --> 02:01:33,291
be like and the trenches and the 
continual death for no apparent gain had

1980
02:01:34,951 --> 02:01:37,680
shaken their whole view of what war was 
all about.

1981
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:39,530
November 19,
14,

1982
02:01:39,531 --> 02:01:41,750
the times ran this piece quote,

1983
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:47,940
all the spectacular side of the war has 
gone never to reappear trenches and 

1984
02:01:48,611 --> 02:01:53,260
always trenches and within range of the 
concealed guns in visibility.

1985
02:01:53,261 --> 02:01:55,630
The supreme law,
day after day,

1986
02:01:55,631 --> 02:02:00,280
the butchery of the unknown by the 
unseen war has become stupid.

1987
02:02:00,580 --> 02:02:05,580
The strain on the infantry is tremendous
and it is endless at the cost of 

1988
02:02:05,580 --> 02:02:08,230
thousands of lives,
a few hundred yards maybe gained,

1989
02:02:08,440 --> 02:02:13,440
but rarely indeed does.
Even the most brilliant attack produce 

1990
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:16,240
anything fresh troops brought up under 
cover of a tremendous artillery fire,

1991
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:19,120
which opens up by surprise,
may affect a breach,

1992
02:02:19,330 --> 02:02:24,330
but only with heavy loss.
Can such an attack be carried through 

1993
02:02:24,330 --> 02:02:28,410
and to quote that little rundown about 
how war has become stupid,

1994
02:02:29,491 --> 02:02:34,491
now accurately describes what the entire
year of 1915 on the western front will 

1995
02:02:35,161 --> 02:02:40,161
be like.
Nobody's going to move at all and 

1996
02:02:40,161 --> 02:02:44,490
amazing numbers of people are going to 
die in efforts that gain nothing.

1997
02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:48,800
Now in the defense of the general sue,
order these efforts to gain nothing.

1998
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:54,520
They have to figure out how to do things
including experimentation to our minds.

1999
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:58,130
You would think you would stop after a 
while,

2000
02:02:58,131 --> 02:03:00,350
but these people had to figure out how 
to win the war.

2001
02:03:00,351 --> 02:03:01,280
I mean,
they didn't even know,

2002
02:03:01,281 --> 02:03:06,281
for example,
how to get through the ever expanding 

2003
02:03:06,281 --> 02:03:09,140
fields of barbed wire that crop up 
between the two enemy trench lines.

2004
02:03:09,290 --> 02:03:14,290
You have to have battles to simply see 
what kind of artillery blows up enough 

2005
02:03:14,290 --> 02:03:17,480
of the wire to create a path for your 
troops to attack through.

2006
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:23,510
This is lessons being learned at an 
incredible cost,

2007
02:03:23,511 --> 02:03:25,340
but there's really no other way to do 
it.

2008
02:03:27,010 --> 02:03:30,370
It's fascinating to look at pictures 
already in 1915,

2009
02:03:31,060 --> 02:03:36,060
six to eight months after the war has 
started and see how this period has 

2010
02:03:36,060 --> 02:03:40,771
become sort of an estuary between the 
19th and the 20th century where you see 

2011
02:03:41,651 --> 02:03:44,350
the combination of the two centuries 
blending.

2012
02:03:44,351 --> 02:03:49,351
I mean when the war starts,
you have cavalry that is 

2013
02:03:49,351 --> 02:03:52,501
indistinguishable from napoleon's queer 
sears going off to war with gleaming 

2014
02:03:52,871 --> 02:03:57,871
breastplates and horse herrick helmets 
and sabers and spurs and white gloves,

2015
02:03:58,540 --> 02:04:01,150
and now you have gas and soon you're 
going to have,

2016
02:04:01,510 --> 02:04:03,490
you know,
german cavalry lancers.

2017
02:04:03,491 --> 02:04:05,710
For example.
As soon as 1916 rolls around,

2018
02:04:05,711 --> 02:04:10,711
they start having the same helmet that 
the germans would use in the second 

2019
02:04:10,711 --> 02:04:10,711
world war,
the stall helm,

2020
02:04:10,711 --> 02:04:14,950
and you have know cavalry with lances 
and install helm and a gas mask,

2021
02:04:14,951 --> 02:04:19,660
and it's the perfect example of the two 
arrows blending in sort of like I said,

2022
02:04:19,661 --> 02:04:24,661
a historical estuary.
You go from that napoleonic feeling of 

2023
02:04:26,711 --> 02:04:31,120
war with french soldiers going off into 
the conflict with bright red pants.

2024
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:33,250
You know,
in six to eight months later,

2025
02:04:33,251 --> 02:04:35,380
we have gas,
we have flame throwers,

2026
02:04:35,650 --> 02:04:39,000
we have hundreds of guns,
a time firing on battlefields.

2027
02:04:39,001 --> 02:04:40,530
We have trenches,
barbed wire,

2028
02:04:40,531 --> 02:04:45,531
snipers everywhere.
This is not what anybody thought was 

2029
02:04:45,531 --> 02:04:50,151
going to happen and it begins to unhinge
a lot of people,

2030
02:04:50,940 --> 02:04:54,270
which is something that is new to the 
human experience,

2031
02:04:54,300 --> 02:04:59,300
at least as far as the modern european 
armies are concerned.

2032
02:05:02,030 --> 02:05:03,710
People begin to go insane

2033
02:05:04,850 --> 02:05:07,340
to lose their mind,
to have their nerves shattered,

2034
02:05:07,580 --> 02:05:09,680
and this is something,
as I said,

2035
02:05:09,740 --> 02:05:14,740
no,
this war does something that seems 

2036
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:17,350
unbelievable.
The ability to take one of the most 

2037
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:20,711
stressful situations human beings ever 
find themselves in and make it worse 

2038
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:23,330
because all war is psychologically 
challenging,

2039
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:28,540
isn't it?
What made the first world war more 

2040
02:05:28,540 --> 02:05:32,381
difficult than almost any other major 
conflict you can think of is not just 

2041
02:05:32,381 --> 02:05:34,610
the changes in warfare,
although that's significant,

2042
02:05:35,210 --> 02:05:39,170
but how long the soldiers were forced to
deal with it.

2043
02:05:40,190 --> 02:05:45,190
I mean take one of the worst battles in 
human history to be a soldier in the 

2044
02:05:45,861 --> 02:05:50,861
famous second punic war battle of kony,
right where hannibal and his 

2045
02:05:51,021 --> 02:05:54,230
carthaginians famously surround maybe 
80,000

2046
02:05:54,231 --> 02:05:57,680
romans and then spend the entire 
afternoon.

2047
02:05:58,220 --> 02:06:03,220
No slaughtering them by hand,
cutting their way into the center of 

2048
02:06:03,220 --> 02:06:07,421
this crowd of doomed men who have to 
wait all day in the most unbelievably 

2049
02:06:08,920 --> 02:06:10,940
just orienting environment you can think
of.

2050
02:06:10,940 --> 02:06:12,650
They can't hear anything.
They can't see anything.

2051
02:06:12,651 --> 02:06:17,651
There's dust everywhere,
but they know what's coming and were 

2052
02:06:17,651 --> 02:06:21,011
told by the ancient writers.
That's so terrible that when the 

2053
02:06:21,011 --> 02:06:22,730
carthaginians cut their way into the 
center of this massive doomed men,

2054
02:06:23,150 --> 02:06:28,150
they will find that some roman soldiers 
packed so tightly that they couldn't 

2055
02:06:28,150 --> 02:06:31,520
even raise their hands in this crowd of 
people just sunk to their knees,

2056
02:06:31,790 --> 02:06:36,790
dug a little hole with their hands,
put their head in the hole and covered 

2057
02:06:36,790 --> 02:06:40,091
it up,
committing suicide because either they 

2058
02:06:40,091 --> 02:06:41,570
had lost their minds or they'd come to 
the conclusion,

2059
02:06:41,810 --> 02:06:46,810
why wait for the inevitable that's 
supposed to show you how terrible the 

2060
02:06:46,810 --> 02:06:51,311
situation is in the first world war.
You begin to see very quickly people who

2061
02:06:52,431 --> 02:06:54,500
are unhinged,

2062
02:06:56,220 --> 02:06:59,090
these soldiers trapped at the battle of 
[inaudible].

2063
02:06:59,091 --> 02:07:04,091
we're having a historic bad day,
but it was one day a week or two before 

2064
02:07:06,721 --> 02:07:09,480
that battle.
They were in relatively little danger if

2065
02:07:09,481 --> 02:07:11,430
they survived a week or two after that 
battle,

2066
02:07:11,431 --> 02:07:16,431
same thing.
The soldiers in the great war had no 

2067
02:07:16,431 --> 02:07:20,331
such luxury.
They had to deal with these 

2068
02:07:20,331 --> 02:07:23,271
circumstances day after day after day 
and after this war.

2069
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:28,640
Military psychologist looking into the 
phenomenon of what will later be known 

2070
02:07:28,640 --> 02:07:32,691
as shell shock will determine that under
the conditions these soldiers were 

2071
02:07:32,691 --> 02:07:34,920
fighting in.
It doesn't matter how brave you were.

2072
02:07:35,140 --> 02:07:36,670
Eventually,
you know,

2073
02:07:36,671 --> 02:07:39,370
we each had a different threshold we 
could stand,

2074
02:07:39,371 --> 02:07:41,440
but eventually anyone would lose their 
mind.

2075
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:46,230
Think about what's involved and you 
begin to understand why.

2076
02:07:46,231 --> 02:07:51,231
First take the shelling itself,
which is something that is really 

2077
02:07:52,081 --> 02:07:57,081
impossible for any of us to understand.
There are very few people living that 

2078
02:07:57,081 --> 02:08:00,741
have ever been through the kinds of 
shelling that these world war one 

2079
02:08:00,741 --> 02:08:04,071
soldiers routinely had to deal with and 
it's very hard to describe one of the 

2080
02:08:04,980 --> 02:08:09,980
traditional kinds of shelling in that 
war was something that came to be known 

2081
02:08:09,980 --> 02:08:13,101
as drum fire.
Drum fire is so named because it sounds 

2082
02:08:13,530 --> 02:08:16,110
like a drum roll.
And instead of,

2083
02:08:16,180 --> 02:08:21,180
you know,
just hearing the drum being tapped at 

2084
02:08:21,180 --> 02:08:23,091
that speed,
each one of those things represent a 

2085
02:08:23,091 --> 02:08:25,311
shell going off.
That's how quickly the shells are 

2086
02:08:25,311 --> 02:08:25,311
landing.

2087
02:08:25,311 --> 02:08:26,910
Ernst,
younger who we've quoted,

2088
02:08:26,911 --> 02:08:28,380
uh,
the author of the storm of steel,

2089
02:08:28,381 --> 02:08:33,381
one of the most unusual soldiers by the 
way in the first world war because he 

2090
02:08:33,381 --> 02:08:37,110
kind of liked the war and he kind of saw
positive benefits to it,

2091
02:08:37,111 --> 02:08:39,270
you know,
so sort of the uplifting side of war.

2092
02:08:39,570 --> 02:08:44,570
And he was about as brave as any soldier
you will ever find lost his composure 

2093
02:08:45,960 --> 02:08:50,960
under artillery fire.
He explains a situation where he comes 

2094
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:53,760
under fire and just loses his mind 
temporarily.

2095
02:08:53,761 --> 02:08:58,761
You know this again,
one of the strongest people mentally in 

2096
02:08:58,761 --> 02:09:00,150
the first world war that we know about 
and younger says,

2097
02:09:00,151 --> 02:09:00,570
quote,

2098
02:09:01,800 --> 02:09:06,800
we fell out and extended order and lay 
down expectantly and a series of 

2099
02:09:06,800 --> 02:09:10,731
flattish depressions that some 
predecessors of ours had scooped out of 

2100
02:09:10,731 --> 02:09:13,650
the ground are rebelde.
Conversations were suddenly cut off by a

2101
02:09:13,651 --> 02:09:18,060
marrow freezing cry 20 yards behind us,
clumps of earth,

2102
02:09:18,061 --> 02:09:20,970
world up out of a white cloud and 
smacked into the bows.

2103
02:09:21,330 --> 02:09:24,450
The crash echoed through the woods 
stricken eyes,

2104
02:09:24,451 --> 02:09:29,451
looked at each other.
Bodies pressed themselves into the 

2105
02:09:29,451 --> 02:09:31,230
ground with a humbling sensation of 
powerlessness to do anything else.

2106
02:09:31,720 --> 02:09:35,490
Explosion followed explosion choking 
gases drifted over,

2107
02:09:35,491 --> 02:09:38,280
the undergrowth,
smoke obscured the tree tops,

2108
02:09:38,430 --> 02:09:40,710
trees and branches came crashing to the 
ground,

2109
02:09:40,711 --> 02:09:43,770
screams.
We leapt up and ran blindly,

2110
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:47,580
chased by lightnings and crushing air 
pressure from tree to tree,

2111
02:09:47,790 --> 02:09:52,790
looking for cover,
skirting around giant tree trunks like 

2112
02:09:52,790 --> 02:09:56,151
frightened game,
a dugout where many men had taken 

2113
02:09:56,151 --> 02:09:56,490
shelter and which I too was running 
towards,

2114
02:09:56,610 --> 02:10:01,610
took a direct hit that ripped up the 
planking and sent heavy timber spinning 

2115
02:10:01,610 --> 02:10:04,350
through the air like a couple of 
squirrels having stones thrown at them.

2116
02:10:04,470 --> 02:10:09,470
The nco and I dodged panting around a 
huge beach tree quite mechanically and 

2117
02:10:09,691 --> 02:10:14,691
spurred on by further explosions.
I ran after my superior who sometimes 

2118
02:10:14,691 --> 02:10:16,890
turn round and stared at me wild.
I yelling,

2119
02:10:17,130 --> 02:10:19,880
what in god's name are those things?
What are they?

2120
02:10:20,160 --> 02:10:24,120
Suddenly there was a flash among the 
route work and a below on the left thigh

2121
02:10:24,121 --> 02:10:29,121
flung me to the ground.
I thought I had been struck by a clump 

2122
02:10:29,121 --> 02:10:32,271
of earth,
but the warm trickle of blood indicated 

2123
02:10:32,271 --> 02:10:33,060
that I had been wounded.
Later I saw that a needle sharp piece of

2124
02:10:33,590 --> 02:10:38,590
had given me a flesh wound.
Don't my wallet had taken the brunt of 

2125
02:10:38,590 --> 02:10:38,590
it,
the fine cut,

2126
02:10:38,590 --> 02:10:40,490
which before slicing into the muscle had
split.

2127
02:10:40,491 --> 02:10:45,491
No fewer than nine thicknesses of stout 
leather looked as though it might've 

2128
02:10:45,491 --> 02:10:48,110
been administered by a scalpel.
He continues.

2129
02:10:48,980 --> 02:10:52,460
I threw down my haversack and ran toward
the trench we had come from,

2130
02:10:52,730 --> 02:10:57,730
from all sides,
wounded men were making tracks towards 

2131
02:10:57,730 --> 02:10:57,730
it from the shelled woods.

2132
02:10:57,730 --> 02:11:00,680
The trench was appalling,
choked with seriously wounded and dying.

2133
02:11:00,681 --> 02:11:04,130
Men of figure stripped to the waist with
a ripped open back,

2134
02:11:04,190 --> 02:11:09,190
leaned against the parapet another with 
a triangular flap hanging off the back 

2135
02:11:09,190 --> 02:11:11,690
of his skull emitted short high pitched 
screams.

2136
02:11:11,930 --> 02:11:16,930
This was the home of the great god pain,
and for the first time I looked through 

2137
02:11:16,930 --> 02:11:20,630
a devilish chink into the depths of his 
realm and fresh shells came down all the

2138
02:11:20,631 --> 02:11:23,300
time.
I lost my head completely.

2139
02:11:23,540 --> 02:11:28,540
Ruthlessly.
I barged past every one on my path 

2140
02:11:28,540 --> 02:11:29,930
before finally having fallen back a few 
times in my haste,

2141
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:35,140
climbing out of the hellish crush of the
trench to move more freely above like a 

2142
02:11:35,140 --> 02:11:39,281
bolting horse.
I rushed through the dense undergrowth 

2143
02:11:39,281 --> 02:11:42,040
across paths and clearings.
To I collapse in the cops by the grand 

2144
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:45,881
trine,
she and quote this one of the most 

2145
02:11:46,041 --> 02:11:49,010
suicidal,
he brave soldiers of the great war.

2146
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:54,880
If it can happen to him,
it could happen to anyone and I am 

2147
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:59,080
constantly amazed at the immense bravery
and an almost carelessness of death that

2148
02:12:02,541 --> 02:12:06,890
our grandparents and great grandparents 
showed consistently in this conflict and

2149
02:12:06,891 --> 02:12:11,891
I always wonder about how I do or my 
generation would do in the same 

2150
02:12:12,261 --> 02:12:13,100
situation.

2151
02:12:15,850 --> 02:12:20,850
Younger tries later on to explain what 
the feeling of being in an artillery 

2152
02:12:21,191 --> 02:12:26,191
barrage is like.
And it's difficult because we have 

2153
02:12:26,191 --> 02:12:26,950
nothing to compare it to.
have you ever been on an airplane,

2154
02:12:26,951 --> 02:12:31,951
for example,
with when it's in heavy turbulence and 

2155
02:12:31,951 --> 02:12:31,951
it takes one of those horrible drops in 
your stomach?

2156
02:12:31,951 --> 02:12:33,580
Just sort of.
I mean there's.

2157
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:37,480
I can't even describe that feeling and 
that's nothing younger.

2158
02:12:38,140 --> 02:12:43,140
Writes this in one of the greatest 
descriptions I've ever heard of what it 

2159
02:12:43,140 --> 02:12:46,801
feels like and he was trying to explain 
it to people who've never experienced 

2160
02:12:46,801 --> 02:12:46,840
it.
He wrote this quote.

2161
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:52,800
It's an easier manner to describe these 
sounds than to endure them because one 

2162
02:12:52,811 --> 02:12:57,160
cannot put associate every single sound 
of flying steel with the idea of death,

2163
02:12:57,430 --> 02:13:01,600
and so I huddled in my hole in the 
ground with my hand in front of my face,

2164
02:13:01,810 --> 02:13:04,660
imagining all the possible variants of 
being hit.

2165
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:10,080
I think I found a comparison that 
captures the situation in which I and 

2166
02:13:10,080 --> 02:13:13,180
all the other soldiers who took part in 
this war so often found ourselves.

2167
02:13:13,540 --> 02:13:18,540
You musT imagine that you were securely 
tied to a post beinG menaced by a man 

2168
02:13:18,540 --> 02:13:23,341
swinging a heavy hammer.
Now the hammer has been taken back over 

2169
02:13:23,341 --> 02:13:24,040
his head,
ready to be swung.

2170
02:13:24,190 --> 02:13:28,540
Now it's cleaving the air towards you on
the point of touching your skull.

2171
02:13:28,810 --> 02:13:31,830
Then it struck the post and the 
splinters flying.

2172
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:37,250
That's what it's like to experience 
heavy shelling in an exposed position 

2173
02:13:37,250 --> 02:13:37,260
and quote.

2174
02:13:40,050 --> 02:13:44,640
Now when you can take cover in the 
trench and press yourself up against the

2175
02:13:44,641 --> 02:13:49,500
earth and dig your head into the soil 
and try to just weather the storm,

2176
02:13:49,501 --> 02:13:54,501
that's hard enough,
but there are a lot of times in this 

2177
02:13:54,501 --> 02:13:57,621
conflict.
A lot of times when your job is to run 

2178
02:13:57,621 --> 02:13:59,760
through the drum,
fire in the hail of shells,

2179
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:03,120
to do everything your body tells you not
to do.

2180
02:14:03,121 --> 02:14:06,300
If orange younger can get carried away 
by the shell fire,

2181
02:14:06,510 --> 02:14:11,510
you know what hope do regular role joe's
like yours truly have right yulia scotch

2182
02:14:12,710 --> 02:14:16,920
and is in one of those situations that 
soldiers all through the war will be in.

2183
02:14:16,921 --> 02:14:19,050
When you know some officer blows a 
whistle and says,

2184
02:14:19,051 --> 02:14:22,470
time to jump out of the trench and run 
past the gunfire,

2185
02:14:23,100 --> 02:14:26,730
and he writes the feeling you have when 
it's your turn.

2186
02:14:28,590 --> 02:14:33,590
We had approached the firing line a 
little more than two miles when we got 

2187
02:14:33,590 --> 02:14:34,860
within reach of the enemy's curtain of 
fire.

2188
02:14:35,100 --> 02:14:38,790
A terrific hail of shells was plowing up
every foot of ground.

2189
02:14:39,090 --> 02:14:44,090
Thousands of corpses of german soldiers 
were witnesses to the immense loss as 

2190
02:14:44,090 --> 02:14:47,130
the germans had suffered in bringing up 
all available reserves.

2191
02:14:47,370 --> 02:14:52,370
the french tried their utmost to prevent
the germans from bringing in their 

2192
02:14:52,370 --> 02:14:55,200
reserves and increased their artillery 
fire to an unheard of violence.

2193
02:14:55,530 --> 02:14:58,920
It seemed impossible for us to break 
through that barricade of fire.

2194
02:14:59,070 --> 02:15:01,500
Hundreds of shells were bursting every 
minute.

2195
02:15:01,890 --> 02:15:06,420
We were ordered to pass that hell singly
and that a running pace.

2196
02:15:06,750 --> 02:15:11,750
We were lying on the ground and observed
how the first of our men tried to get 

2197
02:15:11,750 --> 02:15:13,170
through.
some ran forward like mad,

2198
02:15:13,290 --> 02:15:18,290
not heating.
The shells that were bursting around 

2199
02:15:18,290 --> 02:15:18,870
them and got through.
Others were entirely buried by the dirt,

2200
02:15:18,871 --> 02:15:22,590
dug up by the shells or were torn to 
pieces by shell splinters.

2201
02:15:22,920 --> 02:15:26,790
Two men had scarcely reached the line 
when they were struck by a bullseye.

2202
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,760
I eat the heavy shell,
exploded at their feet,

2203
02:15:29,790 --> 02:15:34,790
leaving nothing of them who can imagine 
what we were feeling during these 

2204
02:15:34,790 --> 02:15:36,240
harrowing minutes as we lay crouching on
the ground,

2205
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:41,540
not quite a hundred feet away,
seeing everything and only waiting for 

2206
02:15:41,540 --> 02:15:46,041
our turn to come.
One had entangled oneself and amaze of 

2207
02:15:46,041 --> 02:15:47,310
thoughts.
Suddenly one of the officers Would cry.

2208
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:51,930
The next one that was I just as if 
roused out of a bad dream,

2209
02:15:52,110 --> 02:15:57,110
I jumped up and race away like mad,
holding the rifle in my right hand and 

2210
02:15:57,121 --> 02:16:02,121
the bayonet in my left eye.
Jump aside a few steps in front of to 

2211
02:16:02,121 --> 02:16:05,691
bursting shells and running into two 
others which are bursting at the same 

2212
02:16:05,691 --> 02:16:06,630
time.
I leapt back several times,

2213
02:16:06,631 --> 02:16:11,631
run forward again,
race about wildly to find a gap through 

2214
02:16:11,631 --> 02:16:14,721
which to escape,
but fire an iron everywhere like a 

2215
02:16:14,721 --> 02:16:14,721
hunted beast.
One,

2216
02:16:14,721 --> 02:16:18,600
seek some opening To save oneself.
hell is in front of me and behind me.

2217
02:16:18,601 --> 02:16:22,530
The officers revolver kept ready to 
shoot the lumps of steel,

2218
02:16:22,531 --> 02:16:26,670
fall down like a heavy shower from high 
above hell and damnation.

2219
02:16:26,910 --> 02:16:30,220
I blindly run and run and run until 
someone gets me by my coat.

2220
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:33,280
Where there someone roars into my ear,
stopped.

2221
02:16:33,610 --> 02:16:35,230
Are you wounded?
Have a look.

2222
02:16:35,380 --> 02:16:39,100
Perhaps you are and you don't know it.
Here I am trembling all over.

2223
02:16:39,340 --> 02:16:41,290
Sit down.
The other person says,

2224
02:16:41,330 --> 02:16:43,600
you will feel better.
We trembled too.

2225
02:16:44,960 --> 02:16:45,530
End quote.

2226
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:52,700
How many of us could do that and think 
about the mentality and how these people

2227
02:16:52,711 --> 02:16:54,040
were raised,
you know,

2228
02:16:54,060 --> 02:16:57,030
and what was involved that allowed them 
to do this.

2229
02:16:57,031 --> 02:17:02,031
I mean,
I have a feeling that my generation 

2230
02:17:02,031 --> 02:17:04,041
would just turn around at the office or 
holding a gun to wash to get us to do 

2231
02:17:04,041 --> 02:17:05,790
that and figure that guy can't take us 
all out.

2232
02:17:05,791 --> 02:17:10,791
We're not going into that.
We did a history show once about the 

2233
02:17:10,921 --> 02:17:14,040
question of whether the older generation
raised in a different time.

2234
02:17:14,041 --> 02:17:19,041
We're tougher than we were,
and of course there's no way to really 

2235
02:17:19,041 --> 02:17:22,371
come to any conclusions about that,
but when you read this and you see what 

2236
02:17:22,371 --> 02:17:24,060
our grandparents and great grandparents 
did,

2237
02:17:24,720 --> 02:17:29,670
it boggles the mind and if those shells 
will drive you insane,

2238
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:35,360
the carnage that they create that you 
have to live around every day just may.

2239
02:17:36,120 --> 02:17:41,120
As I said,
one of the terrible things about this 

2240
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:42,891
battle that's different from most of the
second world war is in the second world 

2241
02:17:42,891 --> 02:17:44,010
war.
you have what's called the moving front.

2242
02:17:44,190 --> 02:17:48,630
When dire in his famous piece war talked
about the continuous front,

2243
02:17:48,631 --> 02:17:53,631
as he calls it,
the first world war initiated in the 

2244
02:17:53,631 --> 02:17:55,290
second world war.
The continuous front moves,

2245
02:17:55,291 --> 02:18:00,291
right?
You have blitzkrieg and the people are 

2246
02:18:00,291 --> 02:18:01,410
continually changing locations.
What makes the battlefields of the first

2247
02:18:01,411 --> 02:18:02,490
world war,
as we said earlier,

2248
02:18:02,491 --> 02:18:06,120
so particularly horrifying,
is that it doesn't change location.

2249
02:18:06,570 --> 02:18:11,130
You get to live around the carnage from 
years past,

2250
02:18:11,131 --> 02:18:14,520
even in the second world war eugene 
sledge riding,

2251
02:18:14,910 --> 02:18:17,970
you know from the us marines talking 
about fighting in the pacific.

2252
02:18:18,210 --> 02:18:23,210
We'll talk about his particularly 
horrified feeling as he watched flies 

2253
02:18:23,670 --> 02:18:26,310
that were feeding on dead bodies right 
near him,

2254
02:18:26,550 --> 02:18:30,900
fly right to the edge of his coffee cup 
and land in his coffee.

2255
02:18:31,530 --> 02:18:36,530
these are the little horrifying things 
that you would think after a while will 

2256
02:18:36,530 --> 02:18:40,080
just drive you out of your mind.
Phillip gibbs and his absolutely 

2257
02:18:41,531 --> 02:18:45,820
groundbreaking work now it can be told 
was a journalist on the scene,

2258
02:18:45,821 --> 02:18:48,610
as we said earlier,
and unable to write about the reality of

2259
02:18:48,611 --> 02:18:53,110
the war until afterwards.
He describes one of these situations and

2260
02:18:53,111 --> 02:18:56,590
just how incredible it was to have to 
live in this.

2261
02:18:56,830 --> 02:18:58,630
It's worse than the charnel house.

2262
02:19:00,320 --> 02:19:05,320
He describes an area called a huge that 
was so terrible near the battlefield and

2263
02:19:08,631 --> 02:19:09,260
he says,
quote,

2264
02:19:10,430 --> 02:19:14,540
the worst school of war for the sons of 
gentleman was in those days and for long

2265
02:19:14,541 --> 02:19:19,541
afterwards huge.
This was the devil's playground and his 

2266
02:19:19,541 --> 02:19:23,240
chamber of horrors wherein he devised 
mary tortures for young christian men.

2267
02:19:23,570 --> 02:19:28,570
It waS not far out of [inaudible] to the
left of the men and road and to the of 

2268
02:19:28,570 --> 02:19:30,890
is wildwood and sanctuary would for a 
time.

2269
02:19:30,891 --> 02:19:35,891
There was a chateau.
They're called the white shadow with 

2270
02:19:35,891 --> 02:19:38,150
excellent stables and good accommodation
for one of our brigades staffs until one

2271
02:19:38,151 --> 02:19:43,151
of our generals was killed and others 
wounded by a shell which broke up their 

2272
02:19:43,151 --> 02:19:43,520
conference.
Afterwards.

2273
02:19:43,521 --> 02:19:48,521
There was no shadow but only a rubble of
bricks banked up with sandbags and deep 

2274
02:19:48,521 --> 02:19:53,131
mind craters filled with stinking water 
slopping over from the belvoir data lake

2275
02:19:53,540 --> 02:19:55,040
and low lying pools.

2276
02:19:55,400 --> 02:19:58,640
Bodies and bits of bodies and clots of 
blood and green.

2277
02:19:58,641 --> 02:20:03,641
Metallic looking.
Slime made by explosive gases were 

2278
02:20:03,641 --> 02:20:07,241
floating on the surface of that water 
below the crater banks when I first 

2279
02:20:07,241 --> 02:20:11,051
passed that way,
and so it was always our men live there 

2280
02:20:11,051 --> 02:20:15,340
and died there within a few yards of the
enemy crouched below the sand bags and 

2281
02:20:15,340 --> 02:20:18,470
pasted into the mud banks.
If they dug to get deeper,

2282
02:20:18,471 --> 02:20:23,471
cover their shovels went into the 
softness of dead bodies who had been 

2283
02:20:23,471 --> 02:20:24,620
their comrades.
Scraps of flesh,

2284
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:27,260
booted legs,
blackened hands,

2285
02:20:27,410 --> 02:20:32,410
eilis heads came falling over them.
When the enemy trench more in their 

2286
02:20:32,410 --> 02:20:34,840
position or blew up a new mineshaft end 
quote,

2287
02:20:37,060 --> 02:20:42,060
how would that not drive anybody crazy?
That is war made worse.

2288
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:48,520
That's you living in zombie land and 
being shelled at the same time.

2289
02:20:48,550 --> 02:20:50,320
It's.
It is,

2290
02:20:50,321 --> 02:20:52,150
As I said many times and will continue 
to say,

2291
02:20:52,270 --> 02:20:57,270
this is the worst experience for 
soldiers in warfare I've ever seen on a 

2292
02:20:57,270 --> 02:21:00,841
mass scale,
even in stalin grodd and the second 

2293
02:21:00,841 --> 02:21:04,801
world war,
widely considered one of the worst 

2294
02:21:04,801 --> 02:21:07,501
places to be in the world.
That just equals the experience that 

2295
02:21:07,501 --> 02:21:10,750
many men on the western front got to 
experience routinely.

2296
02:21:12,100 --> 02:21:17,100
How did they deal with it in ways that 
are some sort of a wonderful testament 

2297
02:21:19,031 --> 02:21:22,090
to human nature?
They often joked about it.

2298
02:21:23,140 --> 02:21:28,140
They adopted a sort of gallows humor at 
times that reminds you of police 

2299
02:21:29,351 --> 02:21:34,351
officers or firemen or let's be honest,
journalists and soldiers and people who 

2300
02:21:35,081 --> 02:21:38,520
see this horrible stuff and their way of
coping with it.

2301
02:21:38,860 --> 02:21:39,700
His humor,

2302
02:21:41,860 --> 02:21:45,970
the journalist Philip Gibbs experienced 
this and took part in it,

2303
02:21:46,390 --> 02:21:48,430
and this was his theory on the whole 
thing.

2304
02:21:49,720 --> 02:21:54,720
It was astonishing how loudly one laugh 
to tales of gruesome things of wars 

2305
02:21:54,720 --> 02:21:59,641
brutality I with the rest of them.
I think at the bottom of it was a sense 

2306
02:21:59,641 --> 02:22:04,321
of the ironical contrast between the 
normal ways of civilian life and this 

2307
02:22:04,321 --> 02:22:09,211
hark back to the cave man code.
it made all of our old philosophy of 

2308
02:22:09,211 --> 02:22:13,951
life monstrously ridiculous.
It played the hat trick with the 

2309
02:22:13,951 --> 02:22:17,380
gentility of modern manners.
Men who had been brought up to christian

2310
02:22:17,381 --> 02:22:22,381
virtues who would prattle dear little 
prayers at their mother's knees who had 

2311
02:22:22,381 --> 02:22:25,120
grown up to love poetry,
painting music,

2312
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:30,260
the gentle arts over sensitized to the 
subtleties of halftones delicate scales 

2313
02:22:31,111 --> 02:22:33,990
of emotion.
Fastidious in their choice of words,

2314
02:22:34,110 --> 02:22:39,110
in their sense of beauty found 
themselves compelled to live and act 

2315
02:22:39,110 --> 02:22:41,430
like eight men and it was a bottom 
bubbly funny.

2316
02:22:41,790 --> 02:22:46,790
They laughed at the most frightful 
episodes which revealed this contrast 

2317
02:22:46,790 --> 02:22:49,680
between civilized ethics and the old 
beast law.

2318
02:22:49,920 --> 02:22:54,920
The more revolting it was,
the more sometimes they shouted with 

2319
02:22:54,920 --> 02:22:55,890
laughter,
especially in reminiscence,

2320
02:22:56,040 --> 02:23:01,040
when the tail was told of the gilded 
sAlon of the french chateau or at the 

2321
02:23:01,040 --> 02:23:01,140
table,

2322
02:23:02,290 --> 02:23:07,290
it was I think he writes the Laughter of
mortals at the trick which had been 

2323
02:23:07,290 --> 02:23:10,870
played on them by an ironical fate.
They had been taught to belIeve that the

2324
02:23:10,871 --> 02:23:15,871
whole object of life was to reach out to
beauty and love and that mankind in its 

2325
02:23:15,971 --> 02:23:19,300
progress to perfection had killed the 
beast instinct,

2326
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:21,040
cruelty,
blood,

2327
02:23:21,041 --> 02:23:24,670
lust,
the primitive savage laws of survival by

2328
02:23:24,671 --> 02:23:28,270
tooth and claw and club and acts,
all poetry,

2329
02:23:28,330 --> 02:23:31,540
all art.
All religion had preached this gospel in

2330
02:23:31,541 --> 02:23:36,541
this promise.
Now that ideal had broken like a China 

2331
02:23:36,541 --> 02:23:38,710
vase dash to hard ground.
The contrast between that,

2332
02:23:38,830 --> 02:23:43,830
and this was devastating,
and to quote the stories that they told 

2333
02:23:46,970 --> 02:23:50,780
were both funny and revealing in a 
horrified way,

2334
02:23:50,781 --> 02:23:55,781
like the gallows humor you see from 
police officers and soldiers and 

2335
02:23:55,781 --> 02:23:58,991
whatnot.
OnE of the ones is this one quote in one

2336
02:23:59,771 --> 02:24:04,771
section of trenches,
the men made a habit of bedding upon 

2337
02:24:04,771 --> 02:24:04,771
those who would be wounded.
First.

2338
02:24:04,990 --> 02:24:07,540
It had all the uncertainty of the 
roulette table.

2339
02:24:07,690 --> 02:24:11,710
One day when the german gunners were 
putting over a special dose of hate,

2340
02:24:11,950 --> 02:24:16,900
a sergeant kept coming to one dugout to 
inquire about a quote end quote,

2341
02:24:16,990 --> 02:24:21,010
new chum who had come up with the drafts
is private smith.

2342
02:24:21,011 --> 02:24:22,180
All right,
he asked,

2343
02:24:22,420 --> 02:24:23,050
yes,
sergeant,

2344
02:24:23,051 --> 02:24:28,051
he's all right,
answered the men crouching in the dark 

2345
02:24:28,051 --> 02:24:28,051
hole.
Private.

2346
02:24:28,051 --> 02:24:28,960
Smith isn't wounded yet.
Asked the sergeant again.

2347
02:24:28,961 --> 02:24:30,970
Five minutes later,
no sergeant

2348
02:24:31,550 --> 02:24:35,540
private smith was touched by this 
interest in his wellbeing and said,

2349
02:24:35,870 --> 02:24:38,240
that sergeant seems a very kind man,
said,

2350
02:24:38,241 --> 02:24:42,770
the boy seems to love me like a father.
A yell of laughter answered him.

2351
02:24:42,980 --> 02:24:45,770
You pour bleediNg.
Fools said one of his comrades,

2352
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:48,230
he's drawn you in a lottery.
Stood dwayne,

2353
02:24:48,290 --> 02:24:53,290
if you'd been hit,
and another example of this amazing 

2354
02:24:55,581 --> 02:25:00,440
ability of human beings to adapt in 
these kinds of situations with the tools

2355
02:25:00,441 --> 02:25:02,060
given to us,
including humor,

2356
02:25:02,061 --> 02:25:02,950
which again you,
you,

2357
02:25:02,951 --> 02:25:07,951
you look at survivors of auschwitz and 
treblinka and the death camps of the 

2358
02:25:08,091 --> 02:25:13,091
nazis.
The jews were using humor even there to 

2359
02:25:13,091 --> 02:25:15,140
cope.
Gibbs tells this story quote

2360
02:25:16,740 --> 02:25:21,740
in digging new trenches in new dugouts.
Bodies and bits of bodies were on earth 

2361
02:25:21,780 --> 02:25:26,780
and put into sand bags with the soil 
that was sent back down the line of men 

2362
02:25:26,780 --> 02:25:31,051
concealing their work from german eyes 
waiting for any new activity in our 

2363
02:25:31,051 --> 02:25:32,020
ditches.
Bit of bill said,

2364
02:25:32,021 --> 02:25:35,320
the leading man putting in the leg.
Another bit of bill,

2365
02:25:35,380 --> 02:25:37,870
he said,
unearthing a hand bills,

2366
02:25:37,871 --> 02:25:42,871
ugly mug.
He said at a later stage in the 

2367
02:25:42,871 --> 02:25:43,720
operation when a head was found,
gibbs says,

2368
02:25:43,721 --> 02:25:45,370
quote,
as told afterwards,

2369
02:25:45,371 --> 02:25:47,680
that little episode in the trenches 
seemed immensely.

2370
02:25:47,681 --> 02:25:52,681
Comic generals chuckled over it.
Chaplains treasured it and quote all the

2371
02:25:54,341 --> 02:25:58,450
coping mechanisms in the world.
Though we're not enough to help.

2372
02:25:59,110 --> 02:26:02,020
You know when things got to a really 
critical stage,

2373
02:26:02,860 --> 02:26:05,560
every human being has a breaking point 
as we said,

2374
02:26:06,370 --> 02:26:10,150
and what in the first world war was 
called shell shock.

2375
02:26:10,450 --> 02:26:14,170
We mentioned it earlier,
would later be updated to battle fatigue

2376
02:26:14,680 --> 02:26:19,680
as soon as the experts realized it was 
an imprecise term because you didn't 

2377
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:21,400
have to be exposed to artillery shells 
at all to get it.

2378
02:26:21,850 --> 02:26:24,310
Now we would call It post traumatic 
stress disorder.

2379
02:26:24,311 --> 02:26:27,940
You see it in soldiers today.
It's pretty common now.

2380
02:26:28,600 --> 02:26:33,160
I'm not just not a historian.
I'm not a psychologist either,

2381
02:26:33,161 --> 02:26:36,520
so take this with a grain of salt,
but this is something that appears to be

2382
02:26:36,521 --> 02:26:41,521
what they call a spectrum disorder,
meaning you can have a severity scale 

2383
02:26:41,521 --> 02:26:45,970
like one to 10,
and not to minimize anything our current

2384
02:26:45,971 --> 02:26:50,971
veterans go through,
but they'll often come back from these 

2385
02:26:50,971 --> 02:26:50,971
wars,
you know,

2386
02:26:50,971 --> 02:26:54,860
with nightmares or an inability to sleep
or eat properly or to reintegrate into 

2387
02:26:54,911 --> 02:26:57,970
society and they've obviously suffered 
some trauma and damage.

2388
02:26:58,600 --> 02:27:03,600
In the first world war though,
those people would often be shot if you 

2389
02:27:03,761 --> 02:27:05,560
couldn't see visible evidence.

2390
02:27:05,560 --> 02:27:07,690
And oftentimes,
even if you could,

2391
02:27:08,500 --> 02:27:11,980
the people in that era,
especially early in the war,

2392
02:27:12,400 --> 02:27:15,460
didn't look at this as some sort of a 
legitimate problem.

2393
02:27:15,461 --> 02:27:20,461
To them,
this was just another manifestation of 

2394
02:27:20,461 --> 02:27:20,920
cowardice,
punishable by death.

2395
02:27:22,300 --> 02:27:24,550
Take for example,
Philip Gibbs,

2396
02:27:24,551 --> 02:27:29,551
his account,
and he has a bunch of them because this 

2397
02:27:29,551 --> 02:27:29,551
was one of the things that upset him the
most.

2398
02:27:29,551 --> 02:27:33,930
He would go to the front report on what 
the soldiers had to endure and then once

2399
02:27:34,331 --> 02:27:36,530
they were damaged by what they had to 
endure,

2400
02:27:36,790 --> 02:27:41,790
report on how the completely clueless 
militaries of the day,

2401
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:47,400
you know,
then punish them again for something 

2402
02:27:47,400 --> 02:27:47,400
they were already victimized once for he
tells one story,

2403
02:27:47,400 --> 02:27:49,480
for example,
of an officer that he's meeting with who

2404
02:27:49,481 --> 02:27:53,680
comes back to the meeting with him from 
a court marshal hearing.

2405
02:27:53,681 --> 02:27:58,681
He'd just been to where they had 
sentenced one of these people who had 

2406
02:27:58,681 --> 02:28:02,290
had his mind blown by his experience to 
death.

2407
02:28:02,980 --> 02:28:03,700
He says,
quote,

2408
02:28:04,570 --> 02:28:09,570
going up to kemo one day I had to wait 
in battalion headquarters for the 

2409
02:28:09,570 --> 02:28:10,840
officer.
I'd gone to see he was attending a court

2410
02:28:10,841 --> 02:28:12,160
marshal.
Presently.

2411
02:28:12,161 --> 02:28:14,620
He came into the wooden hut with a 
flushed face.

2412
02:28:14,980 --> 02:28:16,240
Sorry,
I had to keep you.

2413
02:28:16,241 --> 02:28:19,300
He said,
tomorrow there will be one swine less in

2414
02:28:19,301 --> 02:28:21,160
the world,
a death sentence.

2415
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:24,230
Gabe said.
He nodded a damned coward,

2416
02:28:24,380 --> 02:28:26,090
said he didn't mind rifle,
fire,

2417
02:28:26,091 --> 02:28:29,240
but couldn't stand shells.
Admitted he left his post.

2418
02:28:29,450 --> 02:28:30,890
He doesn't mind rifle.
Fire.

2419
02:28:30,891 --> 02:28:32,600
Well,
tomorrow morning,

2420
02:28:32,870 --> 02:28:35,510
the officer laughed,
grimley and then listened for a second.

2421
02:28:36,320 --> 02:28:39,740
There were some heavy crumps fallen over
campbell hill rather close.

2422
02:28:39,741 --> 02:28:44,741
It seemed to our wooden hut.
He's talking about artillery shells 

2423
02:28:44,741 --> 02:28:44,741
falling nearby,
by the way.

2424
02:28:44,741 --> 02:28:46,760
Damn those german gunners said,
the officer,

2425
02:28:47,060 --> 02:28:50,210
why can't they give us a little piece?
he turned to his papers,

2426
02:28:50,420 --> 02:28:52,100
but several times while I talked with 
him,

2427
02:28:52,280 --> 02:28:54,740
he jerked his head up and listen to a 
heavy crash.

2428
02:28:55,070 --> 02:29:00,070
On the way back,
I saw a man on foot walking in front of 

2429
02:29:00,070 --> 02:29:01,670
a mountain man past the old hill,
loved the shepherd berg.

2430
02:29:01,880 --> 02:29:05,090
Toward the village of luck.
There was something in the way he walked

2431
02:29:05,091 --> 02:29:05,990
in,
his attitude,

2432
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:09,770
the head hunched forward a little and 
his arms behind his back,

2433
02:29:10,010 --> 02:29:15,010
which made me turn to look at him.
He was manacled and tied by a rope to 

2434
02:29:15,010 --> 02:29:19,361
the mountain man.
I caught one glimpse of his face and 

2435
02:29:19,361 --> 02:29:22,241
then turned away cold and sick.
There was doom written on his face and 

2436
02:29:22,241 --> 02:29:23,090
in his eyes,
a captured look.

2437
02:29:23,570 --> 02:29:28,570
He was walking to his wall and quote,
meaning the wall where he was going to 

2438
02:29:28,570 --> 02:29:31,790
be put up against and shocked by his 
compatriots.

2439
02:29:33,260 --> 02:29:38,260
Gibbs later quotes another general 
saying that anyone who comes down with 

2440
02:29:38,260 --> 02:29:41,711
these symptoms as a damn coward and he'd
have them all shot now early in the war.

2441
02:29:42,740 --> 02:29:47,420
This is how they thought because they 
didn't deal with this routinely.

2442
02:29:47,570 --> 02:29:50,510
There had been a little talk of this 
during the so japanese war,

2443
02:29:50,511 --> 02:29:55,511
a decade before this,
where the russians were encountering 

2444
02:29:55,511 --> 02:29:56,870
this kind of a problem,
but this was a new experience.

2445
02:29:56,871 --> 02:29:59,480
This idea of combat fatigue,
battle fatigue,

2446
02:29:59,481 --> 02:30:01,010
shell shocked.
This would be stuff by the way,

2447
02:30:01,011 --> 02:30:06,011
that all the major militaries of the 
world would study after the first world 

2448
02:30:06,011 --> 02:30:10,040
war and they would incorporate what they
learned into training procedures and how

2449
02:30:10,041 --> 02:30:14,390
you dealt with combat in the next war to
try to minimize these problems.

2450
02:30:14,570 --> 02:30:19,570
Even later in the first world war,
the generals would learn that you need 

2451
02:30:19,570 --> 02:30:21,230
to rotate your troops away from the 
front lines,

2452
02:30:21,410 --> 02:30:22,580
you know,
at regular intervals,

2453
02:30:22,581 --> 02:30:27,581
you can't leave them up there 
indefinitely or they're all going to go 

2454
02:30:27,581 --> 02:30:30,941
crazy,
so you'll see these times where for a 

2455
02:30:30,941 --> 02:30:34,030
week or two,
the troops will have to live in the mud 

2456
02:30:34,030 --> 02:30:34,790
in three feet of standing water under 
shell fire,

2457
02:30:34,791 --> 02:30:35,780
you know,
all the time,

2458
02:30:36,050 --> 02:30:41,050
but then they'll take them to the back,
to the rear areas that are safer and 

2459
02:30:41,050 --> 02:30:43,220
then let them recover and then slowly 
move them back toward the front.

2460
02:30:43,220 --> 02:30:48,220
This rotation was intended to keep them 
fresh and keep them from becoming 

2461
02:30:48,220 --> 02:30:52,151
psychological casualties and you know,
these are people who are foaming at the 

2462
02:30:52,971 --> 02:30:55,940
mouth sometimes when they are brought 
back from the lines.

2463
02:30:55,941 --> 02:30:59,060
These aren't people who are saying,
I just can't handle it any more general.

2464
02:30:59,061 --> 02:31:01,010
Although sometimes that's what you 
encounter.

2465
02:31:01,250 --> 02:31:06,250
These are people whose limbs have turned
to rigor mortis or who are so palsy.

2466
02:31:06,620 --> 02:31:11,620
They can't walk For the epileptic 
seizures or seizure like things you're 

2467
02:31:11,620 --> 02:31:13,070
seeing.
You can actually go sEe this by the way,

2468
02:31:13,071 --> 02:31:15,710
because after the war,
many of these people didn't heal.

2469
02:31:15,711 --> 02:31:17,900
They never healed.
Forty years later,

2470
02:31:17,901 --> 02:31:20,010
they're still taking up hospital

2471
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:25,010
space in some of these countries and 
there are films that the doctors made 

2472
02:31:25,010 --> 02:31:26,010
showing you these people's symptoms and 
they're online.

2473
02:31:26,011 --> 02:31:26,730
You can view them.

2474
02:31:28,810 --> 02:31:33,810
Some of these symptoms are so physical 
in nature that this is kind of how the 

2475
02:31:33,911 --> 02:31:38,911
term shell shock first became 
fashionable because there were theories 

2476
02:31:38,911 --> 02:31:43,270
that maybe the concussion and the change
in air pressure that the shells nearby,

2477
02:31:43,440 --> 02:31:48,440
you know,
exploding actually did brain damage or 

2478
02:31:48,440 --> 02:31:51,181
nerve damage to these people because 
when you actually see some of these 

2479
02:31:51,181 --> 02:31:54,550
cases and how they're affected,
that looks like physical damage.

2480
02:31:54,551 --> 02:31:57,130
It doesn't look like mental damage,
but again,

2481
02:31:57,131 --> 02:32:00,610
that did not prevent the militaries from
treating this as cowardice,

2482
02:32:00,611 --> 02:32:05,611
especially early on and dishing out the 
capital punishment penalty for it.

2483
02:32:07,470 --> 02:32:12,470
That having been said,
it's still fascinating to me how few 

2484
02:32:12,470 --> 02:32:13,650
actually had to be executed for this 
stuff.

2485
02:32:14,160 --> 02:32:19,160
Sometimes you can read books where the 
british hurt themselves in the 19 

2486
02:32:19,160 --> 02:32:19,160
seventies.
I have a book from the 19 seventies and,

2487
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:21,300
and it's just this outbreak,
you know,

2488
02:32:21,301 --> 02:32:26,301
and you look in and 330 people or 
executed or something for uh,

2489
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:28,380
you know,
running away in combat,

2490
02:32:28,381 --> 02:32:30,390
abandoning your post desertion,
those kinds of things.

2491
02:32:30,750 --> 02:32:33,270
And I think to myself,
I think my generation,

2492
02:32:33,480 --> 02:32:36,390
if we were forced to go through what 
those people had to go through,

2493
02:32:36,720 --> 02:32:38,910
that's how many people they'd shoot in a
month

2494
02:32:40,390 --> 02:32:45,390
because what's happening in 1915 and you
can sum up the entire western front in 

2495
02:32:45,791 --> 02:32:50,791
1915,
you don't have to deal with any of the 

2496
02:32:50,791 --> 02:32:52,741
battles is that the situation is,
is degenerating into what we understand.

2497
02:32:53,441 --> 02:32:57,220
The first reward would be like on the 
western front trenches and defenses that

2498
02:32:57,221 --> 02:33:02,221
are becoming evermore sophisticated.
We are now getting beyond the era where 

2499
02:33:02,221 --> 02:33:02,980
we are talking about,
you know,

2500
02:33:02,981 --> 02:33:07,981
one long trench on one side and one long
trench on the other and maybe a little 

2501
02:33:07,981 --> 02:33:09,550
bit of sophistication here and there,
but you know,

2502
02:33:09,560 --> 02:33:14,560
it's a little barbed wire between and 
we're entering into a phase now we're on

2503
02:33:14,681 --> 02:33:19,681
the western front.
You begin to have to fortifications and 

2504
02:33:19,721 --> 02:33:24,721
you're not talking now about successful 
attacks going after people.

2505
02:33:25,151 --> 02:33:30,151
You're trying to batter down defenses 
that go sometimes miles backwards.

2506
02:33:32,140 --> 02:33:37,140
Historian eric dorm bros describes these
deepening 1915 fortifications like this

2507
02:33:38,210 --> 02:33:38,540
Quote.

2508
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:42,240
When the Allies attacked in may 19,
15,

2509
02:33:42,420 --> 02:33:47,420
the trenches were shielded by two belts 
of barbed wire each five feet high and 

2510
02:33:47,640 --> 02:33:52,640
30 meters deep behind the wire lay a 
trench network consisting of three 

2511
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:55,740
lines,
100 meters apart at regular intervals.

2512
02:33:55,741 --> 02:34:00,741
Each tranche had a zigzag or dog leg 
traverse to shield defenders from shells

2513
02:34:00,781 --> 02:34:05,010
landing nearby and prevent attackers 
from firing machine guns down the entire

2514
02:34:05,011 --> 02:34:10,011
length of the trench.
This network of trenches were supported 

2515
02:34:10,011 --> 02:34:13,221
1000 meters back by concrete machine gun
pill boxes to mow down enemies.

2516
02:34:13,711 --> 02:34:15,950
Soldiers who pierced the forward 
positions,

2517
02:34:17,110 --> 02:34:17,590
those

2518
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:22,300
already formidable sounding defenses 
were increased during the summer.

2519
02:34:22,720 --> 02:34:25,210
Burrows continues quote during the 
summer,

2520
02:34:25,211 --> 02:34:29,080
a second double belt of barbed wire went
into place 1000 meters.

2521
02:34:29,081 --> 02:34:31,810
Behind the rear.
Pillbox is of the first trench system.

2522
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:34,690
Then came a second triple line of 
trenches,

2523
02:34:34,691 --> 02:34:39,691
also backed by machine gun emplacements.
The defenders also burrowed ever more 

2524
02:34:39,691 --> 02:34:42,700
deeply into the ground to make the 
system work optimally.

2525
02:34:42,790 --> 02:34:46,690
Monthly outputs of machine guns had 
increased nearly 12 fold.

2526
02:34:47,050 --> 02:34:52,050
Both the first and second trench systems
were linked by communication trenches 

2527
02:34:52,050 --> 02:34:56,011
for moving up.
Reinforcements are retreating 

2528
02:34:56,011 --> 02:34:58,260
underground.
Telephone cables connected the first 

2529
02:34:58,260 --> 02:35:00,490
line with the second as well as with the
artillery far to the rear general falcon

2530
02:35:00,491 --> 02:35:05,491
hinds,
well-designed kilometers deep double 

2531
02:35:05,491 --> 02:35:08,350
killing zones amounted to a massive 
engineering and construction project,

2532
02:35:08,650 --> 02:35:13,480
but it was carried out before the allies
attacked again in september and to quote

2533
02:35:14,980 --> 02:35:19,980
that's attacking a fortress now,
the allies were also deepening and 

2534
02:35:20,440 --> 02:35:22,060
making their trenches more 
sophisticated,

2535
02:35:22,300 --> 02:35:27,300
but not to the same degree the germans 
were because the allies attitude is why 

2536
02:35:27,300 --> 02:35:29,560
would we waste that much effort when 
we're hoping the next attack or the next

2537
02:35:29,561 --> 02:35:30,970
attack breaks us through.

2538
02:35:30,970 --> 02:35:33,190
We be out of these trenches,
will be in their trenches.

2539
02:35:33,730 --> 02:35:38,730
The germans have a much more defensive 
attitude on the western front at this 

2540
02:35:38,730 --> 02:35:39,370
time.
They plan on staying a while.

2541
02:35:39,700 --> 02:35:44,200
They dig deeper into the earth and build
these bunk houses with timber overhead.

2542
02:35:44,300 --> 02:35:46,090
You know,
big trees laid down.

2543
02:35:46,091 --> 02:35:48,880
Log cabin style with earth on top of 
that.

2544
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:50,950
Sometimes they have carpeting on the 
floor,

2545
02:35:50,951 --> 02:35:52,780
wallpaper on the walls,
shelving.

2546
02:35:52,781 --> 02:35:57,490
I mean it's in some ways a giant,
you know,

2547
02:35:57,491 --> 02:36:02,491
roman empire,
kind of hadrian's wall up and down the 

2548
02:36:02,491 --> 02:36:03,280
line,
many belts deep.

2549
02:36:04,030 --> 02:36:09,030
These are insane fortifications.
Who in their right mind would think you 

2550
02:36:09,030 --> 02:36:10,690
want to slam human beings up against 
that over and over again.

2551
02:36:11,320 --> 02:36:16,320
Well,
french and british military leadership 

2552
02:36:16,320 --> 02:36:18,991
on the continent.
That's who francis military leaders 

2553
02:36:18,991 --> 02:36:22,360
also.
Jennifer has an attitude of just get 

2554
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:24,250
them out there on the sacred soil to 
France.

2555
02:36:24,250 --> 02:36:26,800
It's also important resource and 
industrial territory.

2556
02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:32,120
You know,
jennifer will waste if necessary and 

2557
02:36:32,120 --> 02:36:33,730
entire generation of young frenchman to 
eject the honey from francis soil,

2558
02:36:33,970 --> 02:36:38,970
the hun being one of those propaganda 
stake names for the germans and the 

2559
02:36:39,310 --> 02:36:42,070
british commander of british forces in 
France.

2560
02:36:42,190 --> 02:36:44,620
Confusingly,
unironically named as we said before,

2561
02:36:44,680 --> 02:36:48,130
sir John French agrees with jennifer.
Just give us more troops.

2562
02:36:48,310 --> 02:36:53,310
Were the bigger boxer in this prize 
fight and who cares if we hit their 

2563
02:36:53,310 --> 02:36:56,380
elbows and their wrists and their bones?
They're going down eventually,

2564
02:36:56,381 --> 02:36:59,890
just give us more troops who will pound 
these fortifications down,

2565
02:37:00,940 --> 02:37:02,860
and the way they did this,
by the way,

2566
02:37:03,490 --> 02:37:07,870
was with more guns.
Nineteen 15 is not just the beginning of

2567
02:37:07,871 --> 02:37:12,871
the heavy duty trench warfare,
it's the beginning of the attempts to 

2568
02:37:12,871 --> 02:37:15,871
deal with the heavy duty trench warfare 
and you'd do this with ever increasing 

2569
02:37:15,871 --> 02:37:19,870
amounts of guns,
have bigger caliber and using them for 

2570
02:37:19,870 --> 02:37:24,311
longer periods of time in just one of 
these sort of double headed battles that

2571
02:37:24,621 --> 02:37:29,621
will be fought in the middle of the 1915
sir John French figures out a way to 

2572
02:37:29,621 --> 02:37:30,980
break through these kinds of 
fortifications is with many,

2573
02:37:30,981 --> 02:37:35,780
many hours of many,
many guns shooting in a confined area.

2574
02:37:36,600 --> 02:37:41,600
He stockpiles piles.
Five point 2 million shells for use in 

2575
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:41,750
this one.
Double-headed defensive,

2576
02:37:41,930 --> 02:37:46,930
so you're going to pound these 
fortifications and then you're going to 

2577
02:37:46,930 --> 02:37:49,700
send men into the gap to occupy them.
That's what a french general battan said

2578
02:37:49,701 --> 02:37:54,701
that artillery conquers the ground and 
you send the men in afterwards to occupy

2579
02:37:54,861 --> 02:37:57,140
it.
That's the 1915 strategy.

2580
02:37:57,141 --> 02:37:59,960
It's also called by some commanders bite
and hold.

2581
02:38:00,410 --> 02:38:02,020
Some of these generals ideas was,
you know,

2582
02:38:02,080 --> 02:38:05,390
you're grabbing area,
you grab it with artillery,

2583
02:38:05,480 --> 02:38:10,480
you take it over with people when all 
the other side's killed by the 

2584
02:38:10,480 --> 02:38:10,480
artillery,
and then you start fortifying it.

2585
02:38:10,480 --> 02:38:13,970
You turn that into your little castle 
and now you've just moved your sides,

2586
02:38:13,971 --> 02:38:18,971
fortifications more toward their side.
It's a giant moving war of trenches and 

2587
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:23,120
siege fortifications,
and when one side takes a new area,

2588
02:38:23,300 --> 02:38:28,300
the other side goes and attacks them 
right away before they can fortify it 

2589
02:38:28,300 --> 02:38:28,300
again.

2590
02:38:28,300 --> 02:38:29,840
It makes it impossible to follow these 
battles,

2591
02:38:30,860 --> 02:38:35,860
but that's what 1915 looks like evermore
big guns ever more wasted opportunities,

2592
02:38:36,381 --> 02:38:41,381
evermore futility and the most forward 
thinkers amongst the allied leaders and 

2593
02:38:42,680 --> 02:38:47,680
decision makers are looking at this 
already at the end of 1914 and they can 

2594
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:48,590
see it in the distance and they're 
thinking to themselves,

2595
02:38:49,100 --> 02:38:54,100
must we go there?
A french thinker as supposed to have 

2596
02:38:54,100 --> 02:38:58,150
floated the idea first,
but it was picked up most famously by 

2597
02:38:58,150 --> 02:39:00,791
winston churchill and idea of finding a 
flank in another fighting theater.

2598
02:39:02,270 --> 02:39:04,970
Why do we have to throw more troops into
the meat grinder?

2599
02:39:04,971 --> 02:39:08,750
The british empire is just starting to 
produce a decent number of people.

2600
02:39:09,500 --> 02:39:12,440
They've got some building up of troops 
happening.

2601
02:39:12,830 --> 02:39:17,830
These volunteers that first joined up at
the very beginning of the war are now 

2602
02:39:17,830 --> 02:39:22,270
gone through their training period.
They're not going to be thrown in early 

2603
02:39:22,270 --> 02:39:23,720
like general falcon hind did with those 
poor students,

2604
02:39:23,721 --> 02:39:25,850
soldiers they're going to be husband did
for just the right time.

2605
02:39:25,850 --> 02:39:28,100
They're green,
but they're trained.

2606
02:39:29,270 --> 02:39:31,150
Must we throw these precious,
you know,

2607
02:39:31,200 --> 02:39:35,060
troops into the meat grinder.
More empire troops by the way,

2608
02:39:35,061 --> 02:39:36,380
are also showing up.
The canadians,

2609
02:39:36,381 --> 02:39:37,700
as we said,
and indians are already there,

2610
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:42,320
but other troops really from dominions,
I think we said commonwealth earlier and

2611
02:39:42,321 --> 02:39:45,260
although the term was used,
it's not officially the right term until

2612
02:39:45,261 --> 02:39:50,261
between the two wars,
when commonwealth status is granted to 

2613
02:39:50,261 --> 02:39:50,261
some of these places.
Um,

2614
02:39:50,261 --> 02:39:54,520
let's just call them dominions.
Troops from New Zealand and Australia 

2615
02:39:54,520 --> 02:39:58,870
raised up again in,
in patriotic fervor for the cause and 

2616
02:39:58,870 --> 02:40:01,760
large numbers of people relative to the 
total population of these places.

2617
02:40:01,970 --> 02:40:06,970
They're on the way.
Are you really going to sacrifice all 

2618
02:40:06,970 --> 02:40:08,150
these troops into attacking these deep 
fortifications?

2619
02:40:09,670 --> 02:40:11,690
Well,
for the commanders on the western front,

2620
02:40:11,720 --> 02:40:14,160
french and british who were were of

2621
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:17,670
the opinion that every person should be 
thrown into the western front.

2622
02:40:17,850 --> 02:40:22,850
They would argue that it's only a meat 
grinder on the western front because we 

2623
02:40:22,850 --> 02:40:24,840
don't have enough men yet to overrun 
that meat grinder and you give us enough

2624
02:40:24,841 --> 02:40:28,440
people will will end this war fast and a
lot less people will die.

2625
02:40:30,400 --> 02:40:32,290
There was,
as I mentioned earlier,

2626
02:40:32,470 --> 02:40:37,470
a kind of cabal of thinkers who had come
to the conclusion that that sort of 

2627
02:40:37,931 --> 02:40:42,931
thinking was mistaken and that surely 
there are better ideas out there than to

2628
02:40:43,301 --> 02:40:44,320
throw,
you know,

2629
02:40:44,380 --> 02:40:47,560
more and more human beings into the 
teeth of the enemy's defenses.

2630
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:50,170
That cabal had some famous members in 
it.

2631
02:40:50,650 --> 02:40:52,270
Winston churchill,
for example,

2632
02:40:52,300 --> 02:40:55,350
maybe the most famous,
although lord horacio kitchener,

2633
02:40:55,420 --> 02:41:00,310
the war minister not far behind,
and these people were of the opinion,

2634
02:41:00,311 --> 02:41:03,910
I guess you could compare it to a sort 
of a predatory idea.

2635
02:41:04,480 --> 02:41:09,480
They had been trying to take down the 
nastiest animal in the herd for months 

2636
02:41:10,361 --> 02:41:12,880
now and they'd gotten gord in the 
process.

2637
02:41:12,881 --> 02:41:17,881
The germans had done damage to every 
major member of the ally is by this time

2638
02:41:18,730 --> 02:41:23,730
and there were the great lions of France
and britain and Russia looking around 

2639
02:41:23,730 --> 02:41:24,490
and thinking to themselves,
well,

2640
02:41:24,491 --> 02:41:29,491
why don't we just follow the traditional
predatory sort of approach and go after 

2641
02:41:29,491 --> 02:41:34,111
the weak and the sick and the old 
instead of going after the strong and 

2642
02:41:35,561 --> 02:41:40,561
young and dangerous,
and there was a country in the war now 

2643
02:41:40,561 --> 02:41:45,391
that met all three of those key 
classifications as a guy like churchill 

2644
02:41:45,391 --> 02:41:50,341
would have made them country that was 
old and sick and weak.

2645
02:41:53,120 --> 02:41:55,700
There's more than a country was an 
empire,

2646
02:41:56,490 --> 02:42:01,490
was a dying empire.
I've been calling a Turkey throughout 

2647
02:42:01,490 --> 02:42:06,111
this whole show because that's the 
proper name for it in the first world 

2648
02:42:06,111 --> 02:42:08,691
war,
but there's another proper name to that 

2649
02:42:08,691 --> 02:42:11,031
conjures up a whole different set of 
images than the perhaps modern sounding 

2650
02:42:11,031 --> 02:42:14,190
name of Turkey and that's the ottoman 
empire

2651
02:42:15,810 --> 02:42:20,810
and that conjures up images of sultan 
and janissaries and harem and being on 

2652
02:42:24,241 --> 02:42:28,740
the gates of vienna,
almost overrunning into central europe.

2653
02:42:28,741 --> 02:42:33,741
At one point.
At the height of their history of 

2654
02:42:33,741 --> 02:42:35,220
knocking down the walls.
of constantinople,

2655
02:42:35,730 --> 02:42:37,980
formerly known as byzantium to the 
greeks,

2656
02:42:38,130 --> 02:42:42,600
constantinople to the romans,
and then after the salton,

2657
02:42:42,890 --> 02:42:47,890
you know,
got through that historic barrier and 

2658
02:42:47,890 --> 02:42:50,061
conquered the city.
He renamed it is stem bowl as sort of a 

2659
02:42:50,061 --> 02:42:54,231
momento and giant monument for what his 
ottomans had achieved.

2660
02:42:56,950 --> 02:43:01,950
That was when the ottomans were young 
and the ottomans were old now and they 

2661
02:43:02,671 --> 02:43:07,671
were losing territory over the decades 
like nobody's business.

2662
02:43:07,801 --> 02:43:10,290
They were seen as a carcass to be picked
at,

2663
02:43:10,291 --> 02:43:11,770
as we said,
the sick man of europe.

2664
02:43:11,771 --> 02:43:16,771
They were called and someone like 
churchill looked at Turkey just sitting 

2665
02:43:18,161 --> 02:43:19,870
there.
They come into the war in november,

2666
02:43:19,871 --> 02:43:24,871
several months after the war officially 
starts and they're surrounded by water 

2667
02:43:24,871 --> 02:43:26,890
and they're maybe not even a second rate
power.

2668
02:43:26,890 --> 02:43:29,440
They have the territory of a big second 
rate power.

2669
02:43:29,441 --> 02:43:33,370
Lots of places trying to get out of 
Turkey but still stuck in Turkey.

2670
02:43:33,730 --> 02:43:35,530
That's how an read might look at it or 
occurred.

2671
02:43:35,531 --> 02:43:40,531
My look at it or an armenian might look 
at it nonetheless without the means to 

2672
02:43:40,961 --> 02:43:44,620
sort of protect all that territory.
And then one of their main reasons there

2673
02:43:44,621 --> 02:43:49,621
had been a war called the crimean war in
the middle of the 19th century is 

2674
02:43:49,621 --> 02:43:54,211
because Turkey was so weak and yet so 
filled with territory you could take 

2675
02:43:54,850 --> 02:43:59,850
that the british and the french had to 
get involved to keep the russians from 

2676
02:43:59,850 --> 02:44:02,401
snapping up too much of it.
So this appeared to be the easy animal 

2677
02:44:02,401 --> 02:44:06,661
in the herd to take down and a crucial 
place that might have all sorts of 

2678
02:44:06,661 --> 02:44:08,020
impact on the war.
If you did take him down,

2679
02:44:08,260 --> 02:44:13,260
take for example,
all the countries that hadn't decided 

2680
02:44:13,260 --> 02:44:13,900
whose side they were going to fight on.

2681
02:44:13,900 --> 02:44:16,750
Yet when Turkey enters the war,
as we said,

2682
02:44:17,110 --> 02:44:22,110
it's a bit of a headache for the allies 
because they opened up an entire new 

2683
02:44:22,110 --> 02:44:23,050
theater of operations.
Really.

2684
02:44:23,051 --> 02:44:25,330
There might've been a little stuff on 
the side going on,

2685
02:44:25,331 --> 02:44:27,400
but when Turkey gets into the warren,
november 19,

2686
02:44:27,401 --> 02:44:29,710
14,
the middle east is now in play.

2687
02:44:30,070 --> 02:44:33,220
India may be in place.
Southern russia's imply north africa and

2688
02:44:33,221 --> 02:44:36,550
Egypt in play.
The balkans is in play.

2689
02:44:37,450 --> 02:44:42,160
the balkans is territory that when the 
ottoman turks were young and powerful,

2690
02:44:42,370 --> 02:44:47,370
they owned,
they had fought two wars in the past 

2691
02:44:47,740 --> 02:44:52,740
couple of years with the former 
territories that they used to own and 

2692
02:44:52,740 --> 02:44:52,740
watch them,
you know,

2693
02:44:52,740 --> 02:44:54,850
shake off the ottoman empire,
Serbia,

2694
02:44:54,851 --> 02:44:56,260
Bulgaria,
Romania,

2695
02:44:56,261 --> 02:45:01,261
Greece,
all these places had been pulling 

2696
02:45:01,261 --> 02:45:02,881
themselves away from autumn and 
influence for some time now and none of 

2697
02:45:03,131 --> 02:45:06,490
them had decided which side they were 
gonna fight on in this war yet.

2698
02:45:06,670 --> 02:45:11,670
And It's fascinating.
I mean you talk about watching open 

2699
02:45:11,670 --> 02:45:14,581
diplomacy in a way that's like watching 
horse trading going on is watching the 

2700
02:45:14,581 --> 02:45:19,081
allies on one side and the central 
powers on the other side try to convince

2701
02:45:19,181 --> 02:45:21,880
a country to go their way.
I mean with Italy for example,

2702
02:45:22,180 --> 02:45:27,180
it's almost open auction time.
I mean one alliance will walk in the 

2703
02:45:27,180 --> 02:45:27,580
front door and say,
well,

2704
02:45:27,581 --> 02:45:32,581
if we win the war and you're joining us,
you can have this province from the 

2705
02:45:32,581 --> 02:45:32,581
enemy in that province,
in that province do.

2706
02:45:32,581 --> 02:45:32,650
And then you know,
they'll leave.

2707
02:45:32,651 --> 02:45:34,600
And then the other door comes.
The other alliance system saying,

2708
02:45:34,601 --> 02:45:35,710
is that all they promised you?
Well,

2709
02:45:35,711 --> 02:45:37,480
if we could have this,
that and the other thing,

2710
02:45:37,960 --> 02:45:41,170
and this was going on with all these 
countries in the balkans,

2711
02:45:41,600 --> 02:45:42,400
Greece,
for example,

2712
02:45:42,401 --> 02:45:47,401
in the aegean,
the number two thing they were all 

2713
02:45:47,401 --> 02:45:47,401
concerned with is what were they going 
to get?

2714
02:45:47,401 --> 02:45:49,360
They got in the war.
What are you promising me and you know,

2715
02:45:49,390 --> 02:45:54,390
going to the highest bidder,
but the number one thing they were all 

2716
02:45:54,390 --> 02:45:57,571
concerned with his who was gonna win.
These countries knew that they were 

2717
02:45:57,761 --> 02:46:00,910
absolutely like roadkill if they pick 
the wrong side,

2718
02:46:01,240 --> 02:46:06,240
but in early 1915,
no clearcut dominant side had emerged 

2719
02:46:07,360 --> 02:46:10,280
and so churchill and his compatriots had
this idea

2720
02:46:10,280 --> 02:46:15,280
that they could strike a big blow in 
that theater right in that part of the 

2721
02:46:15,280 --> 02:46:18,731
world.
Even if they did knock anybody out with 

2722
02:46:18,731 --> 02:46:18,731
it,
it might convince a lot of these powers.

2723
02:46:18,731 --> 02:46:20,270
While you can see britain's gonna,
when France is going to win,

2724
02:46:20,330 --> 02:46:21,410
let's join them.
Right?

2725
02:46:21,470 --> 02:46:26,470
Changed the course of the war that way.
So all these good arguments like this 

2726
02:46:26,470 --> 02:46:29,900
are starting to accrue for this cabal of
people like winston churchill.

2727
02:46:30,260 --> 02:46:35,260
When all of a sudden something 
intervenes to bring the whole thing to 

2728
02:46:35,260 --> 02:46:38,261
ahead,
put it on the front burner and make the 

2729
02:46:38,261 --> 02:46:38,960
government consider whether or not it's 
a good idea.

2730
02:46:38,990 --> 02:46:41,960
It's one thing to have a good idea.
It's another thing to really be thinking

2731
02:46:41,961 --> 02:46:42,350
about,
okay,

2732
02:46:42,351 --> 02:46:47,351
is this What we do?
And a request from the russians changes 

2733
02:46:47,351 --> 02:46:48,230
this from a theoretical question to one 
that they're debating.

2734
02:46:48,440 --> 02:46:52,100
In early january of 1915,
the russians are asking for help.

2735
02:46:53,230 --> 02:46:56,080
they are facing the turks down near 
there,

2736
02:46:56,460 --> 02:47:01,460
you know,
border the church and the russian 

2737
02:47:01,460 --> 02:47:03,760
territory,
touch but far away from where russian 

2738
02:47:03,760 --> 02:47:07,451
forces are fighting the germans and the 
austra hungarians because of the 

2739
02:47:07,451 --> 02:47:09,110
distance,
the russians had pretty much taken their

2740
02:47:09,111 --> 02:47:14,111
troops and they're fighting for their 
lives against the germans and use them 

2741
02:47:14,111 --> 02:47:16,570
up north and now the turks are attacking
and strength down south.

2742
02:47:17,060 --> 02:47:19,970
The situation will get critical.
In late december,

2743
02:47:19,971 --> 02:47:24,971
went on December 29th,
the turkish forces up against the 

2744
02:47:24,971 --> 02:47:28,391
russians on their mutual border,
start the battle of sarah calmness and 

2745
02:47:28,391 --> 02:47:31,760
try to attack the russian defenders from
multiple sides at once.

2746
02:47:31,761 --> 02:47:36,761
It's a very optimistic,
very napoleonic in concept plan led by a

2747
02:47:38,151 --> 02:47:42,550
civilian strategist actually who will 
take $120,000

2748
02:47:42,551 --> 02:47:47,551
on a good turkish army and ruin it.
I'm in this battle because these 

2749
02:47:48,901 --> 02:47:52,380
russians,
a smaller force than the turks attacking

2750
02:47:52,381 --> 02:47:57,381
them are ensconced in the natural 
fortress that is the caucasus mountain 

2751
02:47:57,381 --> 02:47:59,820
range.
In the middle of winter,

2752
02:48:01,110 --> 02:48:04,350
all this fighting is going to happen at 
elevations between 5,000

2753
02:48:04,351 --> 02:48:05,940
feet and 6,500
feet.

2754
02:48:06,450 --> 02:48:11,450
Turkish soldiers are going to be 
fighting as though they're dressed for 

2755
02:48:11,450 --> 02:48:14,550
the low lands.
The logistics of this hundred and 20,000

2756
02:48:14,551 --> 02:48:19,551
man army are going to be carried up into
these mountains on tiny little windy 

2757
02:48:19,551 --> 02:48:23,391
mountain roads and there's not even many
of them and it's snowing like you can't 

2758
02:48:23,391 --> 02:48:23,580
believe.
We're told,

2759
02:48:23,581 --> 02:48:27,900
have you know,
multiple days of 14 our marches through,

2760
02:48:28,170 --> 02:48:29,700
you know,
waist deep snow.

2761
02:48:29,701 --> 02:48:34,701
By the time these poor turkish troops 
get to the russians there darn near 

2762
02:48:34,701 --> 02:48:37,490
defeated.
Then some of them surrender right away.

2763
02:48:37,500 --> 02:48:40,560
May several cores just surrender that 
you and you just get this image of these

2764
02:48:40,561 --> 02:48:41,970
starving,
you know,

2765
02:48:41,990 --> 02:48:44,880
units that are just falling apart.
And at the end of their rope,

2766
02:48:45,210 --> 02:48:48,120
some fight bravely and almost 
fanatically anyway.

2767
02:48:48,330 --> 02:48:53,330
And then the next part of the story 
that's famous is the retreat of this 

2768
02:48:53,330 --> 02:48:53,880
turkish army back to Turkey.

2769
02:48:53,880 --> 02:48:58,880
They lose about half their strength.
We're told that of the people that do 

2770
02:48:58,880 --> 02:49:03,741
make it back to Turkey,
a third of them are so badly wounded 

2771
02:49:03,741 --> 02:49:06,261
that they'll have some part of their 
body amputated and the stories 

2772
02:49:06,261 --> 02:49:09,300
themselves and it's amazing alike.
They are booked a book,

2773
02:49:09,660 --> 02:49:12,270
but they they.
They create this sort of mental image of

2774
02:49:12,271 --> 02:49:15,570
like napoleon retreating from moscow in 
the winter.

2775
02:49:15,571 --> 02:49:20,571
Harry did the whole way back with these 
soldiers that were freezing on the march

2776
02:49:21,631 --> 02:49:26,631
because it was so cold and the mountain 
passes in the middle of winter and the 

2777
02:49:26,631 --> 02:49:29,580
army is supposed to be followed by packs
of wolves through these,

2778
02:49:29,880 --> 02:49:31,650
you know,
almost bram stoker ish,

2779
02:49:31,651 --> 02:49:36,651
like terrain and taking the frozen 
soldiers as they freeze or as they 

2780
02:49:36,651 --> 02:49:39,660
become too wounded to defend themselves.
It's a horrifying story.

2781
02:49:39,661 --> 02:49:43,020
And the turks will be very bitter and 
affected by this battle.

2782
02:49:43,500 --> 02:49:48,500
The russians will be though too,
because even though they technically 

2783
02:49:48,500 --> 02:49:49,290
when it,
for all they know,

2784
02:49:49,291 --> 02:49:54,291
the turks could do this in another three
weeks or another month and they're not 

2785
02:49:54,291 --> 02:49:54,291
ready for this.
Again,

2786
02:49:54,291 --> 02:49:58,850
the turkish attack down here prove that 
this is not a quiet safe front and you 

2787
02:49:58,850 --> 02:50:01,710
better be ready for more.
They're not ready for more.

2788
02:50:02,130 --> 02:50:03,510
This is why they asked for help

2789
02:50:04,830 --> 02:50:09,830
and they asked for some diversion to be 
made that will draw some of these 

2790
02:50:09,830 --> 02:50:13,161
turkish troops away from them and maybe 
something that will open up the supply 

2791
02:50:14,431 --> 02:50:19,431
lines again beCause the turks control 
one of the most strategically important 

2792
02:50:19,431 --> 02:50:21,270
spots,
not just in the world,

2793
02:50:21,271 --> 02:50:25,830
but in world history.
When you take constantinople in the 15th

2794
02:50:25,831 --> 02:50:27,390
century,
like the turks did,

2795
02:50:28,050 --> 02:50:33,050
the dardanelles come with it.
The dardanelles are the actual 

2796
02:50:33,050 --> 02:50:37,911
separation and this is a geographic 
feature that goes back to forever 

2797
02:50:38,010 --> 02:50:42,780
between asia and europe.
If you look at it on satellite images,

2798
02:50:42,781 --> 02:50:44,770
it looks like a rather large,
um,

2799
02:50:44,870 --> 02:50:49,870
river,
but it really is only a mile apart in 

2800
02:50:49,870 --> 02:50:53,031
some spots.
And this is the waterway that takes you 

2801
02:50:53,031 --> 02:50:53,031
from,
you know,

2802
02:50:53,031 --> 02:50:57,741
the g and c,
which is connected to the mediterranean 

2803
02:50:57,741 --> 02:51:00,801
sea,
which is connected to the rest of the 

2804
02:51:00,801 --> 02:51:01,770
world and get you from there to the 
black sea,

2805
02:51:02,100 --> 02:51:07,100
which is not connected to the rest of 
the world unless you're using the 

2806
02:51:07,100 --> 02:51:07,100
dardanelles.

2807
02:51:07,100 --> 02:51:10,680
It's a straight of extreme importance 
and the turks control it.

2808
02:51:11,280 --> 02:51:15,450
They have fortresses on both sides of 
this glorified river with canon.

2809
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:20,040
they've got mines in the waterway to 
prevent people from getting through that

2810
02:51:20,041 --> 02:51:25,041
they don't want to get through.
And once they get in the War in 

2811
02:51:25,041 --> 02:51:25,041
november,
19,

2812
02:51:25,041 --> 02:51:27,591
14,
they don't want the russians to get 

2813
02:51:27,591 --> 02:51:29,451
through and they don't want the british 
to get through and the french to get 

2814
02:51:29,451 --> 02:51:32,301
through.
And this is a huge problem for Russia 

2815
02:51:32,301 --> 02:51:32,400
because they don't have a lot of places.
You know,

2816
02:51:32,650 --> 02:51:35,550
where people can trade with them via the
ocean.

2817
02:51:35,640 --> 02:51:37,050
Especially,
you know,

2818
02:51:37,051 --> 02:51:40,950
if it's anywhere near the winter months,
if it's near the winter months,

2819
02:51:41,250 --> 02:51:46,250
you need this port open,
the black sea port open and now the 

2820
02:51:46,250 --> 02:51:48,180
turks have closed it.
The russians are in such bad straights.

2821
02:51:48,570 --> 02:51:53,570
They are sending soldiers into battle 
with a rifle and then another soldier 

2822
02:51:54,721 --> 02:51:58,620
whose job it is to shadow the first 
soldier and when the first soldier dies,

2823
02:51:58,621 --> 02:52:01,590
pick up his rifle and use it because the
second person didn't get a rifle.

2824
02:52:03,920 --> 02:52:08,920
The russian industry keep up with the 
military needs and so they're having 

2825
02:52:08,920 --> 02:52:12,631
problems like that so you can see how 
important it is for them to be able to 

2826
02:52:12,631 --> 02:52:15,961
trade with britain and France and maybe 
outside powers if just to get rifles to 

2827
02:52:15,961 --> 02:52:20,940
arm their troops with and now the turks 
have closed off that important area and 

2828
02:52:20,940 --> 02:52:22,150
winston churchill thinks he can open it.

2829
02:52:23,560 --> 02:52:27,250
He gets an idea that will involve any 
ground troops at all.

2830
02:52:27,251 --> 02:52:28,870
He continually points this out in his 
book.

2831
02:52:28,871 --> 02:52:31,990
By the way,
we've used this book for this show,

2832
02:52:31,991 --> 02:52:36,991
but not as a history book because it's 
not the kind of book you want to use to 

2833
02:52:36,991 --> 02:52:40,321
find historical truth.
It's the kind of book you want to look 

2834
02:52:40,321 --> 02:52:41,810
to find the truth.
As churchill saw it,

2835
02:52:41,860 --> 02:52:44,470
unjustified it afterwards,
which is a very different thing.

2836
02:52:45,600 --> 02:52:47,420
Churchill,
his fingerprints are all over this thing

2837
02:52:47,421 --> 02:52:49,550
and this thing is going to go south 
fast,

2838
02:52:50,260 --> 02:52:55,260
and so in churchill's book he does with 
almost any other person with any 

2839
02:52:55,260 --> 02:52:57,250
responsibility for world war one does in
their post war memoirs,

2840
02:52:58,030 --> 02:53:00,460
he defends himself,
answers his critics,

2841
02:53:00,490 --> 02:53:02,320
justifies this,
explains that,

2842
02:53:02,321 --> 02:53:05,870
and um,
be no different than the german generals

2843
02:53:05,871 --> 02:53:10,871
and whatnot in that respect.
But his point is when he thought of this

2844
02:53:11,141 --> 02:53:16,141
idea it didn't involve any land troops,
and since land troops are going to be a 

2845
02:53:16,141 --> 02:53:17,680
huge part of the tragedy that this 
unfolds into,

2846
02:53:17,920 --> 02:53:20,350
he basically says he washed his hands of
the whole plan.

2847
02:53:20,351 --> 02:53:25,351
Once that situation changed,
churchill's plan was to take the 

2848
02:53:25,351 --> 02:53:30,031
largest,
most powerful fleet ever assembled in 

2849
02:53:30,031 --> 02:53:30,460
world history and forced the streets

2850
02:53:31,510 --> 02:53:35,700
simply sail through him,
wiping out any fort,

2851
02:53:35,860 --> 02:53:40,860
you know,
that's anywhere nearby with naval 

2852
02:53:40,860 --> 02:53:40,860
gunfire and go from one side to the 
other.

2853
02:53:40,860 --> 02:53:45,510
And then once you're on the other side,
you're right next to formerly 

2854
02:53:45,510 --> 02:53:45,820
constantinople.
Now istanbul,

2855
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:51,000
and you have a giant megalopolis 
underneath the guns of the greatest 

2856
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:55,621
fleet ever assembled and sent to war.
It's an idea that looks great on paper

2857
02:53:58,100 --> 02:54:02,990
and then by the time events go from a 
all the way through the alphabet to z,

2858
02:54:02,991 --> 02:54:07,991
though you see who rules the alphabet 
between a to z when it comes to getting 

2859
02:54:08,121 --> 02:54:13,121
something from the theoretical stage to 
the reality stage and that's murphy's 

2860
02:54:13,121 --> 02:54:17,321
law and murphy's law grabs hold of these
events and Quickly turns this whole 

2861
02:54:17,601 --> 02:54:21,800
affair into something that no one had 
ever thought was the right thing to do.

2862
02:54:22,400 --> 02:54:27,400
Shows you how people can get swamped by 
events sometimes and churchill spends a 

2863
02:54:27,400 --> 02:54:31,571
good part of his book on this subject 
trying to point out that he was one of 

2864
02:54:31,571 --> 02:54:35,711
the victims of what happened.
He's often been portrayed as the 

2865
02:54:36,071 --> 02:54:36,880
architect

2866
02:54:38,650 --> 02:54:43,650
and if you ever want to see how 
frustrating history can be some times 

2867
02:54:43,650 --> 02:54:46,240
look at churchill's thinking on all this
because when you examine it,

2868
02:54:46,270 --> 02:54:51,270
it's so logical.
He's doing exactly what any of us would 

2869
02:54:51,270 --> 02:54:54,751
hope somebody in a position of power 
would do in terms of going down the 

2870
02:54:54,751 --> 02:54:56,440
arguments and the risks and benefits 
logically,

2871
02:54:56,860 --> 02:55:01,860
and it still turns out horribly.
What sort of lesson is that teaching to 

2872
02:55:01,860 --> 02:55:03,470
the other commanders who were saying,
yes,

2873
02:55:03,490 --> 02:55:08,490
just keep smashing against the wall or 
my goodness doesn't seem to matter 

2874
02:55:08,490 --> 02:55:12,911
whether you think outside the box,
you do the same darn stupid pointless 

2875
02:55:12,911 --> 02:55:16,751
thing again and again.
The first world war equalizes the 

2876
02:55:16,751 --> 02:55:17,780
results of both of that.
In a.

2877
02:55:17,781 --> 02:55:22,010
You're darned if you thinking you're 
darned if you don't think churchill.

2878
02:55:22,070 --> 02:55:27,070
Basic assumption was that the british 
empire was sitting on an enormously 

2879
02:55:27,070 --> 02:55:31,091
powerful fleet that was useless and the 
part that was useless is so useless you 

2880
02:55:31,751 --> 02:55:34,930
can't even use it.
If the enemy fleet comes out to fight,

2881
02:55:34,931 --> 02:55:39,100
there's a whole bunch of british ships 
that were made obsolete only in 19.

2882
02:55:39,101 --> 02:55:40,750
Oh six.
Remember it's 19,

2883
02:55:40,751 --> 02:55:42,010
14,
1915.

2884
02:55:42,580 --> 02:55:43,930
What happened in 19?
Oh six.

2885
02:55:44,290 --> 02:55:47,050
A brand new type of battleship arrived 
on the scene,

2886
02:55:47,500 --> 02:55:48,910
became the name,
you know,

2887
02:55:48,911 --> 02:55:53,911
the initial ship's name was dreadnought 
and that becomes the name for that 

2888
02:55:53,911 --> 02:55:54,520
entire type of vessel,

2889
02:55:55,450 --> 02:55:58,360
a dreadnought or super dreadnought.
That's a class name now,

2890
02:55:58,361 --> 02:56:00,880
and that's because that's how 
revolutionary this ship was.

2891
02:56:01,420 --> 02:56:06,420
The problem is,
is the instantly it arrives on the 

2892
02:56:06,420 --> 02:56:09,301
scene.
It makes obsolete fleets of hugely 

2893
02:56:09,301 --> 02:56:13,291
expensive vessels,
dozens and dozens and dozens of them 

2894
02:56:13,291 --> 02:56:14,290
that have been built up over a lifetime 
makes them obsolete overnight,

2895
02:56:15,370 --> 02:56:17,320
and of course the british being the 
greatest navy in the world.

2896
02:56:17,321 --> 02:56:21,250
They had the most of these battleships,
the older battleships,

2897
02:56:21,430 --> 02:56:23,080
the ones that in 19,
oh,

2898
02:56:23,081 --> 02:56:25,720
five or the greatest force of float and 
in 19,

2899
02:56:25,721 --> 02:56:27,820
oh,
six are ready for the scrap heap,

2900
02:56:28,940 --> 02:56:31,420
and that's what churchill said.
All these ships were heading for.

2901
02:56:31,540 --> 02:56:36,540
What are we saving them for?
They're just going to be scrapped after 

2902
02:56:36,540 --> 02:56:37,390
the war and he says that the admiral's 
had these emotional attachments to these

2903
02:56:37,391 --> 02:56:42,391
ships because they had served on the 
more they remembered the day when these 

2904
02:56:42,391 --> 02:56:45,661
were the most powerful war ships afloat 
and churchill's attitude is these are 

2905
02:56:45,661 --> 02:56:46,060
assets to be used up for.
AGain,

2906
02:56:46,300 --> 02:56:48,340
we can use them in the dardanelles and 
if we lose them,

2907
02:56:48,370 --> 02:56:52,890
we don't lose anything,
but he's got a lot of them.

2908
02:56:54,740 --> 02:56:59,740
winston churchill's plan of using the 
fleet in a lightening attack that the 

2909
02:56:59,740 --> 02:57:01,570
turks weren't ready for with massive 
forest.

2910
02:57:01,571 --> 02:57:06,571
I could just force the straights before 
anyone could respond to it turns into 

2911
02:57:06,571 --> 02:57:10,250
something totally different over the 
next several weeks,

2912
02:57:10,970 --> 02:57:15,970
and churchill has always claimed that 
the events were completely out of his 

2913
02:57:15,970 --> 02:57:18,350
control,
but he uses as an argument the line that

2914
02:57:18,351 --> 02:57:20,900
he was told that there were no troops 
available,

2915
02:57:20,901 --> 02:57:25,901
so any plan he came up with pretty much 
had to have a tiny little group of 

2916
02:57:25,901 --> 02:57:27,530
marines to run on shore and knock out a 
gun if necessary,

2917
02:57:27,680 --> 02:57:32,680
but nothing else.
So he says basically he can't be 

2918
02:57:32,680 --> 02:57:32,750
responsible for this land disaster 
that's about to happen.

2919
02:57:32,990 --> 02:57:34,640
He never assumed there'd be any troops 
anyway,

2920
02:57:34,641 --> 02:57:38,150
and here's what he says.
Quote at the evening meeting of the war,

2921
02:57:38,151 --> 02:57:42,830
counsel on January 28th when the final 
decision to adopt the plan was taken,

2922
02:57:43,010 --> 02:57:44,780
lord kitchener,
repeated quote,

2923
02:57:44,990 --> 02:57:47,300
we have at present,
no troops despair.

2924
02:57:47,480 --> 02:57:51,890
It was on that foundation alone that all
our decisions in favor of a purely naval

2925
02:57:51,891 --> 02:57:56,891
attack had been taken,
but hence forward a series of new facts 

2926
02:57:56,891 --> 02:57:59,060
and pressures came into play which 
gradually,

2927
02:57:59,240 --> 02:58:04,240
but unceasingly changed the and 
enormously extended the scale of the 

2928
02:58:04,240 --> 02:58:07,350
enterprise under these influences.
In less than two months,

2929
02:58:07,380 --> 02:58:10,050
the naval attack with its lack of 
certainty,

2930
02:58:10,140 --> 02:58:15,020
but with its limited costs and risks 
became subsidiary and in its place there

2931
02:58:15,021 --> 02:58:19,380
are rows and military development of 
great magnitude over this new plan.

2932
02:58:19,381 --> 02:58:21,930
The admiralty had no responsible 
control.

2933
02:58:22,110 --> 02:58:27,110
Our advice did not prevail,
are criticisms were not welcomed and 

2934
02:58:27,110 --> 02:58:29,250
even inquiries became a matter of 
delicacy intact.

2935
02:58:29,580 --> 02:58:34,580
Nonetheless,
by the results of this military 

2936
02:58:34,580 --> 02:58:35,780
operation,
we had to stand or fall and quote,

2937
02:58:36,300 --> 02:58:38,340
I know you don't need translation for 
me,

2938
02:58:38,490 --> 02:58:40,380
but isn't that the same as saying,
hey,

2939
02:58:40,381 --> 02:58:42,150
that wasn't my idea.
You changed it,

2940
02:58:42,151 --> 02:58:44,010
but I still have to be responsible for 
it.

2941
02:58:45,030 --> 02:58:47,880
You see a lot of post world war one 
memoirs that sound like that.

2942
02:58:48,330 --> 02:58:53,330
Nonetheless,
it adequately explains how out of 

2943
02:58:53,330 --> 02:58:56,451
control the process.
Seeing once churchill and his cabal had 

2944
02:58:56,451 --> 02:58:59,280
taken their little private idea and had 
it adopted by not just one government,

2945
02:58:59,281 --> 02:59:03,690
but the allies as the plan and of course
in the final analysis,

2946
02:59:04,110 --> 02:59:07,140
the people with the most control over 
your plan.

2947
02:59:07,200 --> 02:59:12,200
If you're winston churchill or the ones 
on the scene who actually have to make 

2948
02:59:12,200 --> 02:59:15,000
it work.
The military commanders in this case,

2949
02:59:15,001 --> 02:59:20,001
the admiral's on February 17th,
a couple of those admirals are leading 

2950
02:59:21,631 --> 02:59:24,390
the most powerful fleet that's ever gone
to war.

2951
02:59:25,740 --> 02:59:30,740
Now I say that as sort of leaving a 
little loophole because the most 

2952
02:59:30,740 --> 02:59:32,520
powerful fleet in the world is the 
british fleet sitting up in scapa,

2953
02:59:32,521 --> 02:59:35,760
flow up in scotland,
waiting for the german fleet to come out

2954
02:59:35,761 --> 02:59:38,730
and play,
but that leads never done anything.

2955
02:59:39,060 --> 02:59:44,060
They're waiting for their chance.
The largest most powerful fleet that's 

2956
02:59:44,060 --> 02:59:44,670
ever gone to war and tried to do 
something so far.

2957
02:59:44,850 --> 02:59:47,880
This one,
18 or so battleships,

2958
02:59:47,881 --> 02:59:49,500
most of them british,
some of them french.

2959
02:59:50,370 --> 02:59:55,370
Most of these,
the old battleships that were made 

2960
02:59:55,370 --> 02:59:55,470
obsolete a decade before,
but also including,

2961
02:59:55,580 --> 02:59:57,120
you know,
the newest super dreadnought,

2962
02:59:57,150 --> 03:00:00,450
the queen elizabeth with 15 inch guns,
you know,

2963
03:00:00,451 --> 03:00:02,820
12 or so cruisers,
30 destroyers,

2964
03:00:02,821 --> 03:00:07,821
a couple hundred transports.
This fleet might not have lasted very 

2965
03:00:07,821 --> 03:00:10,050
long against the crack in the german 
fleet,

2966
03:00:10,320 --> 03:00:15,320
but in this part of the world,
it's the most powerful force afloat and 

2967
03:00:15,360 --> 03:00:19,110
would have been the greatest athlete in 
the world a decade before it arrives.

2968
03:00:19,170 --> 03:00:24,170
You know,
off the coast of Turkey and begins 

2969
03:00:24,170 --> 03:00:26,150
shelling those straits on February 19th 
and things start slowing down.

2970
03:00:28,890 --> 03:00:33,890
The plan is to batter your way through,
destroy all these fortresses as you 

2971
03:00:33,890 --> 03:00:37,101
continue to move deeper and deeper into 
this sort of river like piece of 

2972
03:00:37,101 --> 03:00:38,280
geography,
but you know the weather gets bad,

2973
03:00:38,281 --> 03:00:39,760
so the fleet retreats,
you know,

2974
03:00:39,780 --> 03:00:44,780
to a safe distance and then it comes up 
and they shell some force and then 

2975
03:00:44,780 --> 03:00:45,960
something else goes wrong and churchill 
is sitting back in britain going crazy.

2976
03:00:45,960 --> 03:00:50,960
PullIng his hair out.
Sending messages after message is 

2977
03:00:50,960 --> 03:00:50,960
basically saying,
hurry,

2978
03:00:50,960 --> 03:00:50,960
hurry,
hurry.

2979
03:00:50,960 --> 03:00:54,360
The whole plan requires you to hurry 
because the longer they take,

2980
03:00:54,690 --> 03:00:59,690
the more you lose.
This whole idea that there's some 

2981
03:00:59,690 --> 03:01:02,031
surprise to it that catches the turks 
off guard and so the turks have already 

2982
03:01:02,031 --> 03:01:04,150
figured out when you see the largest 
fleet that had ever gone to war,

2983
03:01:04,690 --> 03:01:09,690
oh,
the british are doing something down 

2984
03:01:09,690 --> 03:01:11,521
here.
The good news is that does take away 

2985
03:01:11,521 --> 03:01:11,521
troops fighting the russians and take 
some pressure off the tsar,

2986
03:01:11,521 --> 03:01:14,290
which was the reason he asked for help 
in the first place.

2987
03:01:14,590 --> 03:01:19,070
The bad news is instead of the british 
advancing against a totally unready foe,

2988
03:01:19,250 --> 03:01:21,130
you know,
and taking advantage of surprise,

2989
03:01:21,340 --> 03:01:26,340
they're sitting there giving the whole 
basic idea way for months on the 18th of

2990
03:01:29,110 --> 03:01:34,110
March,
the fleet decides to try again in a big 

2991
03:01:34,110 --> 03:01:34,110
way.
Churchill's back there,

2992
03:01:34,110 --> 03:01:34,110
prodding them,
get to work,

2993
03:01:34,110 --> 03:01:34,560
get out there,
do it,

2994
03:01:34,561 --> 03:01:39,561
big attack and the 18 battleships and 
the whole fleet goes in and start 

2995
03:01:39,561 --> 03:01:39,561
shelling the forts.

2996
03:01:39,561 --> 03:01:44,240
Some marines are detached and send on 
land to go take some of these sports 

2997
03:01:44,240 --> 03:01:47,650
that are particularly troublesome and 
then shit hits a mine.

2998
03:01:48,060 --> 03:01:51,910
A french battleship rolls over really 
quickly.

2999
03:01:51,911 --> 03:01:53,710
About 700 people die,
boom,

3000
03:01:53,830 --> 03:01:57,640
fast before anyone's had time to digest 
that.

3001
03:01:58,150 --> 03:02:01,030
Another one hits a mine and then another
one,

3002
03:02:01,031 --> 03:02:03,580
and by the way on the scene,
they don't know that these are mines.

3003
03:02:03,581 --> 03:02:06,070
Mines are one of the things they thought
about torpedoes or another.

3004
03:02:06,190 --> 03:02:08,560
All they know is big,
expensive,

3005
03:02:08,561 --> 03:02:11,260
important ships,
at least in the old days,

3006
03:02:11,680 --> 03:02:16,680
are starting to sink and list and 
explode and the commander is pull 

3007
03:02:16,680 --> 03:02:20,730
everything back and by the time they get
away from the streets they've lost or 

3008
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:26,040
seeing crippled six battleships now what
winston churchill would say and what he 

3009
03:02:26,651 --> 03:02:28,450
did say is,
who cares?

3010
03:02:28,960 --> 03:02:32,530
These are old battleship.
They're not of any use to us at all,

3011
03:02:32,650 --> 03:02:35,440
so use them to take the straits,
but at least take the streets.

3012
03:02:35,590 --> 03:02:37,840
He said the admiral's had a whole 
different opinion.

3013
03:02:38,800 --> 03:02:41,110
They didn't see this as an asset to be 
used.

3014
03:02:41,260 --> 03:02:45,850
They saw it as a charge to protect these
admirals.

3015
03:02:45,851 --> 03:02:50,851
He said,
had an emotional attachment to these 

3016
03:02:50,851 --> 03:02:52,551
ships.
They walked their decks back when they 

3017
03:02:52,551 --> 03:02:53,890
were young officers in these ships were 
the queens of the seas and he says,

3018
03:02:53,891 --> 03:02:56,710
now they had this attachment.
They didn't want to lose them,

3019
03:02:56,830 --> 03:02:59,750
and the whole point was they were there 
because they were losing a bowl.

3020
03:03:00,610 --> 03:03:02,920
Again,
what's so terrible about what follows is

3021
03:03:02,921 --> 03:03:07,921
churchill,
his attitude was that this fleet was 

3022
03:03:07,921 --> 03:03:09,571
totally expendable,
but in order to protect this expendable 

3023
03:03:09,571 --> 03:03:13,141
fleet,
the high command decides the ground 

3024
03:03:13,141 --> 03:03:13,300
troops had to be sent in.
They pulled the fleet back.

3025
03:03:13,510 --> 03:03:17,020
They begin assembling these 80,000
men that they're going to attack.

3026
03:03:17,350 --> 03:03:22,350
This area within.
The plan is to overwhelm this peninsula 

3027
03:03:22,350 --> 03:03:22,990
called the gallipoli peninsula.

3028
03:03:22,990 --> 03:03:26,520
That's right next to the dardanelles and
take over all those fortune,

3029
03:03:26,560 --> 03:03:29,140
all those gun positions with your ground
troops.

3030
03:03:29,470 --> 03:03:34,470
Then those guns won't fire on your 
little teeny minesweepers who are 

3031
03:03:34,470 --> 03:03:38,190
clearing the streets of the mines and 
then your big battleships won't get 

3032
03:03:38,190 --> 03:03:41,881
mind,
but it's the tail wagging the dog here 

3033
03:03:41,881 --> 03:03:46,440
and churchill and others have said,
ever since the war was over that this 

3034
03:03:46,440 --> 03:03:49,921
was a disaster waiting to happen because
the whole point of this plan is to use 

3035
03:03:49,921 --> 03:03:52,270
strategic surprise to catch the enemy 
off guard.

3036
03:03:52,390 --> 03:03:57,200
How's the going to be going to be caught
off guard when it takes five weeks after

3037
03:03:57,201 --> 03:03:58,090
the battleships pull

3038
03:03:58,090 --> 03:04:00,950
back to get the ground forces onto the 
beaches?

3039
03:04:02,300 --> 03:04:04,700
The turks are commanded by a german 
general.

3040
03:04:04,701 --> 03:04:09,701
In this case,
a very competent guiding liman von 

3041
03:04:09,701 --> 03:04:13,451
sanders,
who supposedly says if the allies will 

3042
03:04:13,451 --> 03:04:14,030
just give him eight days,
he can put together a defense.

3043
03:04:14,031 --> 03:04:15,500
He's desperate for time,
eight days,

3044
03:04:15,501 --> 03:04:19,400
just give me eight days.
They gave him five weeks and by the time

3045
03:04:19,401 --> 03:04:22,370
the landings take place in late april,
early may,

3046
03:04:22,371 --> 03:04:23,390
19,
15,

3047
03:04:24,350 --> 03:04:27,770
to say that the turks are ready,
maybe is a little bit presumptuous,

3048
03:04:28,400 --> 03:04:33,400
but they're waiting and you get a chance
to see what the worst nightmares of 

3049
03:04:36,420 --> 03:04:40,980
allied planners who were planning for d 
day in the second world war.

3050
03:04:40,981 --> 03:04:44,460
You know the attack across the beaches,
across the english channel,

3051
03:04:44,461 --> 03:04:47,460
landing allied troops on the occupied 
french coastline.

3052
03:04:47,550 --> 03:04:52,550
You can see what their nightmares must 
have been like because they were young 

3053
03:04:52,550 --> 03:04:55,551
men.
When they got to see how something like 

3054
03:04:55,551 --> 03:04:57,681
an amphibious assault could go wrong 
because they saw it on the beaches of 

3055
03:04:57,681 --> 03:04:59,160
gullapalli.
First of all,

3056
03:04:59,790 --> 03:05:03,090
it was a nightmare of improvisation.

3057
03:05:04,630 --> 03:05:08,440
These troops were trained for war,
not trained for amphibious assault.

3058
03:05:09,250 --> 03:05:11,350
They landed sometimes on the wrong 
beaches.

3059
03:05:11,530 --> 03:05:14,980
They had completely somehow gotten the 
terrain or wrong.

3060
03:05:14,981 --> 03:05:19,981
Even with aerial surveillance.
I mean the poor australians are landed 

3061
03:05:19,981 --> 03:05:22,990
in a cove a mile from where they were 
supposed to land.

3062
03:05:23,290 --> 03:05:28,290
It's like a reverse amphitheater and 
historian john keegan who visited the 

3063
03:05:28,290 --> 03:05:32,641
site said,
the one thing that overwhelms you when 

3064
03:05:32,641 --> 03:05:34,501
you go there is how tiny it is.
It's this tiny little cove and you drop 

3065
03:05:34,501 --> 03:05:38,671
a ton of australians there with the high
ground all around them like an 

3066
03:05:38,671 --> 03:05:42,280
amphitheater and just leave them there 
on some of these beaches.

3067
03:05:42,610 --> 03:05:46,510
The allies are able to land route 
relatively easily and try to capture the

3068
03:05:46,511 --> 03:05:51,511
high ground on other beaches they land 
and aren't sure what to do on a couple 

3069
03:05:51,511 --> 03:05:55,861
of these beaches.
The turks are waiting for them and 

3070
03:05:55,861 --> 03:05:56,020
massacres in shoe.
In one,

3071
03:05:56,470 --> 03:06:01,470
the allies had taken a like a transport 
ship and cut out a hole in it so that 

3072
03:06:01,661 --> 03:06:06,661
they could drive it right up on the 
beach and the soldiers could just jump 

3073
03:06:06,661 --> 03:06:10,111
out and be ready to fight.
The turks trained machine guns on the 

3074
03:06:10,111 --> 03:06:11,830
door and when the door opened and all 
these troops jumped out,

3075
03:06:11,831 --> 03:06:14,050
they were machine guns one by one by 
one.

3076
03:06:14,051 --> 03:06:19,051
As they hit the beach,
less than 25 of them made it to the 

3077
03:06:19,051 --> 03:06:19,720
beach out of several hundred.

3078
03:06:21,200 --> 03:06:25,220
Even when the allied forces at great 
cost sometimes take these beaches,

3079
03:06:25,550 --> 03:06:30,550
they're not always sure what to do next.
They have no idea how things are going 

3080
03:06:30,550 --> 03:06:33,170
on the beach next to them.
They don't know if the ship's know where

3081
03:06:33,171 --> 03:06:35,060
they are,
the ships don't know where they are.

3082
03:06:35,270 --> 03:06:40,270
There's no coordination going on and you
really get a wonderful object lesson in 

3083
03:06:40,641 --> 03:06:45,641
which you're also getting on the western
front concerning what weapons system is 

3084
03:06:45,641 --> 03:06:47,720
really missing from this war.
I mean it exists,

3085
03:06:47,721 --> 03:06:52,721
but not in a way where it's coordinated,
not in a way that you'll see it come of 

3086
03:06:52,721 --> 03:06:55,991
age in the next world war.
It's one of those things that when you 

3087
03:06:55,991 --> 03:06:56,250
consider in a vacuum,

3088
03:06:56,250 --> 03:06:58,770
it doesn't even sound like a weapon.
It's like barbed wire.

3089
03:06:58,771 --> 03:07:00,240
You don't think of barbed wire as a 
weapon.

3090
03:07:00,420 --> 03:07:03,810
You don't think of radio communications 
as a weapon either,

3091
03:07:04,290 --> 03:07:08,760
but it's been the missing ingredient in 
so many of these missed opportunities in

3092
03:07:08,761 --> 03:07:13,761
this war.
If only the troops that broke through 

3093
03:07:13,761 --> 03:07:16,401
knew they broke through,
if only they could change where the 

3094
03:07:16,401 --> 03:07:18,981
artillery was shooting.
If only we could bring up 

3095
03:07:18,981 --> 03:07:18,981
reinforcements.
This happens all the time on the western

3096
03:07:18,981 --> 03:07:21,810
front.
Now it's happening at [inaudible].

3097
03:07:23,610 --> 03:07:26,610
Sometimes these troops land and they 
just sort of stand there.

3098
03:07:26,611 --> 03:07:28,080
They don't know what they're supposed to
do next.

3099
03:07:28,110 --> 03:07:33,110
Or they take the first position that the
plans ahead of time called for them to 

3100
03:07:33,110 --> 03:07:34,440
take and they stopped there.
What would you expect them to do?

3101
03:07:34,500 --> 03:07:36,000
They don't know what's going on.

3102
03:07:36,520 --> 03:07:39,370
They have to be careful or their own 
artillery is going to shell them.

3103
03:07:39,700 --> 03:07:44,700
The problem is is once again,
it allows the turks to respond and you 

3104
03:07:44,700 --> 03:07:49,411
will see a lot of fighting going on for 
the high ground of these areas that 

3105
03:07:49,411 --> 03:07:53,150
overlook the beaches and you know,
this whole plan still might have work is

3106
03:07:53,151 --> 03:07:55,660
the turks had turned out to be a soft 
enemy.

3107
03:07:56,110 --> 03:08:01,110
You know,
if they'd turned out to be as weak and 

3108
03:08:01,110 --> 03:08:03,351
as decadent and as you know,
unmotivated as allied planner sort of 

3109
03:08:03,351 --> 03:08:04,420
assumed that they would be.
Instead,

3110
03:08:04,421 --> 03:08:08,220
they fought like lions,
which the turks are capable of.

3111
03:08:08,221 --> 03:08:10,950
The turks are very dangerous soldiers.
The ethnic turks especially,

3112
03:08:11,370 --> 03:08:16,370
and there'll be an incident at one of 
the tops of these heights were allied 

3113
03:08:16,370 --> 03:08:20,121
forces are fighting with turkish forces,
led by a guy named mustafa kemal,

3114
03:08:20,950 --> 03:08:25,950
who after the war will become one of the
most important figures in postwar 

3115
03:08:25,950 --> 03:08:29,221
Turkey.
It's about 35 years old and he sees the 

3116
03:08:29,221 --> 03:08:30,820
allied forces in his area reaching the 
heights.

3117
03:08:30,821 --> 03:08:35,821
Everybody knows that these heights are 
going to be important and he orders his 

3118
03:08:35,821 --> 03:08:38,911
troops that are out of ammunition to 
hold them off and he says these famous 

3119
03:08:38,940 --> 03:08:40,990
lines that have gone down in turkish 
history.

3120
03:08:41,560 --> 03:08:42,160
He says,
quote,

3121
03:08:43,150 --> 03:08:48,150
I don't order you to attack.
I order you to die in the time which 

3122
03:08:48,150 --> 03:08:50,170
passes until we die.
Other troops and commanders can take our

3123
03:08:50,171 --> 03:08:52,370
place.
End quote.

3124
03:08:53,720 --> 03:08:56,870
That's about the opposite reaction of 
what the allies were expecting.

3125
03:08:56,871 --> 03:09:01,871
The turk resistance to be like.
The allied resistance is just as 

3126
03:09:02,401 --> 03:09:07,401
spirited.
The australians and new zealanders and 

3127
03:09:07,401 --> 03:09:07,401
gurkhas.
To Be honest,

3128
03:09:07,401 --> 03:09:12,391
we'll prove themselves some of the best,
if not the best fighters in the war on 

3129
03:09:12,391 --> 03:09:16,501
these beaches,
but they're completely hamstrung by the 

3130
03:09:16,501 --> 03:09:19,570
screw up of the situation and in almost 
no time,

3131
03:09:20,290 --> 03:09:25,290
the gallipoli campaign turns into a 
mediterranean version of the western 

3132
03:09:26,921 --> 03:09:31,921
front and it's got all the same tragic 
hallmarks that the western front has 

3133
03:09:34,730 --> 03:09:38,720
barbed wire artillery,
no man's land trenches.

3134
03:09:38,721 --> 03:09:42,580
The whole thing and the military 
historian would point out that of course

3135
03:09:42,581 --> 03:09:44,680
it does.
It's the same situation,

3136
03:09:44,681 --> 03:09:48,640
the same things and conditions that 
created the need to have people dig into

3137
03:09:48,641 --> 03:09:53,020
the earth and they created the power of 
the defensive over the offensive is just

3138
03:09:53,110 --> 03:09:54,400
present in the mediterranean

3139
03:09:54,400 --> 03:09:56,320
and the aegean as it is on the western 
front.

3140
03:09:57,340 --> 03:10:02,340
The australians find out about this 
firsthand and I grew up next to an air 

3141
03:10:02,340 --> 03:10:06,421
force colonel when I was a kid who 
fought in the second world war and I 

3142
03:10:06,421 --> 03:10:07,000
used to ask him who the toughest 
soldiers were.

3143
03:10:07,020 --> 03:10:08,290
You know,
wHen I'm eight.

3144
03:10:08,320 --> 03:10:13,320
That was an interesting question to me 
and I always wanted to hear something 

3145
03:10:13,320 --> 03:10:16,891
like the germans and I remember he 
surprised me once by saying the british 

3146
03:10:16,891 --> 03:10:19,240
in general and the australians and New 
Zealand troops specifically,

3147
03:10:19,540 --> 03:10:20,740
and I said,
why?

3148
03:10:20,741 --> 03:10:25,741
And he said because you would find 
yourself in these horrible situations 

3149
03:10:25,741 --> 03:10:29,140
and they would be laughing and joking 
and he said,

3150
03:10:29,141 --> 03:10:34,141
that's indicative of a,
of a level of bravery that you don't 

3151
03:10:34,141 --> 03:10:35,680
normally see,
but it doesn't always help you.

3152
03:10:35,681 --> 03:10:37,130
There's a story,
um,

3153
03:10:37,380 --> 03:10:42,380
of an australian corporate who wrote 
about being pinned down on one of these 

3154
03:10:42,380 --> 03:10:45,481
beaches when they land and the turks 
have the high ground and they're 

3155
03:10:45,481 --> 03:10:47,971
shooting down at these poor australians 
who are trying to get their act 

3156
03:10:47,971 --> 03:10:47,971
together,
get organized,

3157
03:10:47,971 --> 03:10:52,531
figure out what we do next while they're
under fire and while their friends are 

3158
03:10:52,531 --> 03:10:52,531
dying.

3159
03:10:52,531 --> 03:10:54,070
And yes,
for a little while,

3160
03:10:54,130 --> 03:10:55,690
some of them are laughing.
He writes,

3161
03:10:55,691 --> 03:11:00,691
quote,
a galling fire rained on us from the 

3162
03:11:00,691 --> 03:11:03,781
left where there were high cliffs.
One man dropped down alongside me 

3163
03:11:03,781 --> 03:11:05,620
laughing.
I broke the news to him gently.

3164
03:11:05,770 --> 03:11:08,410
You've got yourself into the hottest 
corner you'll ever strike.

3165
03:11:08,650 --> 03:11:12,490
I'd shown him where the enemy were.
He fired a few shots and again,

3166
03:11:12,491 --> 03:11:14,320
I heard the sickening thought of a 
bullet.

3167
03:11:14,620 --> 03:11:18,130
I looked at him in horror.
The bullet had fearfully mashed his face

3168
03:11:18,131 --> 03:11:20,380
and gone down his throat,
rendering him dumb,

3169
03:11:20,680 --> 03:11:22,630
but his eyes were dreadful.
To behold,

3170
03:11:22,900 --> 03:11:26,020
how he squirmed in agony.
There was nothing I could do for him,

3171
03:11:26,021 --> 03:11:31,021
but pray that he might die swiftly.
It took them about 20 minutes to 

3172
03:11:31,021 --> 03:11:34,501
accomplish this and by that time he 
tangled up his legs and pain and 

3173
03:11:34,501 --> 03:11:38,281
stiffened.
I saw the waxy color creep over his 

3174
03:11:38,281 --> 03:11:39,390
cheek and breathe easier and cool.

3175
03:11:40,450 --> 03:11:44,050
Amazing to think about this one person 
who's got to consider his own life,

3176
03:11:44,051 --> 03:11:46,780
which is under attack,
how he deals with troops,

3177
03:11:46,781 --> 03:11:51,781
who need him,
and he gets to watch that going on for 

3178
03:11:51,781 --> 03:11:53,690
20 minutes to.
If I tend to focus on the horror and the

3179
03:11:53,691 --> 03:11:54,640
story,
ladies and gentlemen,

3180
03:11:54,670 --> 03:11:58,930
it's because that's what gets to me.
Any history read on any subject is going

3181
03:11:58,931 --> 03:12:02,710
to by its very nature the person telling
the story,

3182
03:12:02,711 --> 03:12:05,050
usually a historian,
but then sometimes you get stuck with me

3183
03:12:05,620 --> 03:12:09,340
is going to focus on the things that 
intrigue or interest them for me.

3184
03:12:09,760 --> 03:12:14,760
It's what these people had to go through
on all sides and it's the horror that I 

3185
03:12:14,760 --> 03:12:18,850
constantly try to imagine myself 
experiencing and it's mind blowing to me

3186
03:12:19,300 --> 03:12:21,280
and I think after as many shows as we've
done,

3187
03:12:21,281 --> 03:12:23,680
the ones who've stayed with me listening
like you,

3188
03:12:24,190 --> 03:12:26,010
there's got to be something that touches
you too.

3189
03:12:26,450 --> 03:12:31,450
AT the literally.
You have this same charnel house 

3190
03:12:31,450 --> 03:12:34,890
situation where dead bodies are a part 
of your life and living amongst them is 

3191
03:12:37,271 --> 03:12:39,820
part of the horror.
It's bad enough that your life is always

3192
03:12:39,821 --> 03:12:44,821
at stake,
that you watch all this death and 

3193
03:12:44,821 --> 03:12:44,821
destruction,
but you live with corpses.

3194
03:12:44,821 --> 03:12:47,860
Corpses of people you often know or 
knew.

3195
03:12:48,670 --> 03:12:53,670
This is a remembrance by british soldier
leonard thompson who arrives at the 

3196
03:12:53,670 --> 03:12:56,360
dardanelles right after the major 
landing quote.

3197
03:12:57,120 --> 03:13:02,120
We arrived at the dardanelles and saw 
the guns flashing and heard the rifle 

3198
03:13:02,120 --> 03:13:03,060
fire.
They heaved our ship,

3199
03:13:03,090 --> 03:13:05,040
the river clyde,
right up to the shore.

3200
03:13:05,250 --> 03:13:07,470
They had cut a hole in it and made a 
little pier,

3201
03:13:07,471 --> 03:13:10,110
so we were able to walk straight off and
onto the beach.

3202
03:13:10,350 --> 03:13:14,130
We all sat there on the hellespont 
waiting for it to get light.

3203
03:13:14,430 --> 03:13:17,670
The first things we saw were big wreck 
turkish guns.

3204
03:13:17,910 --> 03:13:21,600
The second a big marquee.
It didn't make me think of the military,

3205
03:13:21,780 --> 03:13:24,840
but if the village phets,
other people must have thought like this

3206
03:13:24,841 --> 03:13:29,841
too,
because I remember hoW we all rushed up 

3207
03:13:29,841 --> 03:13:30,870
to it like boys getting into a circus 
and then found it all laced up.

3208
03:13:31,140 --> 03:13:34,440
We unlaced it and rushed in.
It was full of corpses,

3209
03:13:34,710 --> 03:13:39,710
dead englishman,
lines and lines of them with their eyes 

3210
03:13:39,710 --> 03:13:40,260
wide open.
We all stopped talking.

3211
03:13:40,620 --> 03:13:45,620
I'd never seen a dead man before and 
here I was looking at two or 300 of 

3212
03:13:45,620 --> 03:13:46,410
them.
It was our first fear.

3213
03:13:46,620 --> 03:13:51,620
Nobody had mentioned this.
I was very shocked and I thought of 

3214
03:13:51,620 --> 03:13:54,831
suffolk and how it seemed to happy place
for the first time we set to work to 

3215
03:13:54,831 --> 03:13:59,691
bury people.
We push them into the sides of the 

3216
03:13:59,691 --> 03:14:02,301
trench,
but bits of them kept getting uncovered 

3217
03:14:02,301 --> 03:14:02,940
and sticking out like people in a badly 
made bed.

3218
03:14:03,150 --> 03:14:06,120
Hands were the worst.
They would escape from the sand,

3219
03:14:06,270 --> 03:14:07,350
pointing,
begging,

3220
03:14:07,380 --> 03:14:10,590
even waving.
There was one which we all shook when we

3221
03:14:10,591 --> 03:14:13,860
passed by saying good morning in a posh 
voice,

3222
03:14:14,040 --> 03:14:19,040
everybody did it.
The bottom of the trench was springy 

3223
03:14:19,040 --> 03:14:21,951
like a mattress because of all the 
bodies underneath at night when the 

3224
03:14:21,951 --> 03:14:25,581
stench was worse,
we tied crepe around our mouth and 

3225
03:14:25,581 --> 03:14:28,731
noses.
This crepe had been given to us because 

3226
03:14:28,731 --> 03:14:28,731
it was supposed to prevent us from being
gassed.

3227
03:14:28,731 --> 03:14:33,210
The flies entered the trenches at night 
and lined them completely with a density

3228
03:14:33,211 --> 03:14:38,211
which was like moving cloth.
We killed millions of them by slapping 

3229
03:14:38,211 --> 03:14:42,381
our spades along the trench wall,
but the next night it would be just as 

3230
03:14:42,381 --> 03:14:45,951
bad.
We were All lousy and we couldn't stop 

3231
03:14:45,951 --> 03:14:48,600
shitting because we caught dysentery.
We wept not because we were frightened.

3232
03:14:49,240 --> 03:14:54,240
We were so dirty and quote and like a 
bad movie.

3233
03:14:55,780 --> 03:15:00,780
The gallipoli campaign,
which was supposed to do an end around 

3234
03:15:00,780 --> 03:15:04,750
the suffering of the western front and 
ended more quickly by striking,

3235
03:15:04,810 --> 03:15:09,810
you know,
the weak joint in the enemy's alliance 

3236
03:15:09,810 --> 03:15:10,930
just extended that suffering to a new 
front.

3237
03:15:12,490 --> 03:15:17,230
The entire affair will get continually 
worse as generals and admirals,

3238
03:15:17,231 --> 03:15:22,231
who don't want to admit defeat,
keep pouring more and more 

3239
03:15:22,231 --> 03:15:22,480
reinforcements into it.
The turks do the same thing.

3240
03:15:22,481 --> 03:15:27,481
It just becomes this ongoing hell and 
this ongoing hell will eventually cost 

3241
03:15:28,571 --> 03:15:31,450
winston churchill his job.
In fact,

3242
03:15:31,451 --> 03:15:34,060
the british government essentially has 
to reorganize.

3243
03:15:34,061 --> 03:15:39,061
They have to create a coalition 
government and churchill's the one left 

3244
03:15:39,061 --> 03:15:41,611
out.
He will leave the admiralty were told 

3245
03:15:41,611 --> 03:15:43,180
after being sacked with tears in his 
eyes,

3246
03:15:43,210 --> 03:15:48,210
certain that his career is over.
Talk about one of the great mistakes all

3247
03:15:49,291 --> 03:15:51,300
time.
Obviously he has a great career ahead of

3248
03:15:51,301 --> 03:15:52,420
him,
but churchill,

3249
03:15:52,500 --> 03:15:57,000
a weird guy and then we'd have to watch 
myself with him because I liked him.

3250
03:15:57,270 --> 03:16:00,000
I think a lot of us like him as a 
historical figure.

3251
03:16:00,001 --> 03:16:02,940
He's quite likable,
teddy roosevelt's the same way,

3252
03:16:03,330 --> 03:16:08,330
but you have to remember that these guys
have qualities that make them somewhat 

3253
03:16:08,330 --> 03:16:11,220
unusual and it's hard to factor those 
qualities into the man.

3254
03:16:11,990 --> 03:16:15,230
Churchill told one of his best friends 
in february 19,

3255
03:16:15,231 --> 03:16:20,231
15,
the time when he's planning this whole 

3256
03:16:20,231 --> 03:16:22,930
[inaudible] thing,
something that's relatively shocking to 

3257
03:16:22,930 --> 03:16:26,291
hear when the whole world is stunned by 
the carnage of the worst war in human 

3258
03:16:26,421 --> 03:16:29,780
history.
He told his friend this quote,

3259
03:16:30,230 --> 03:16:34,310
I think a curse should rest on me 
because I love this war.

3260
03:16:34,460 --> 03:16:37,940
I know it's smashing and shattering the 
lives of thousands every moment,

3261
03:16:37,941 --> 03:16:42,920
and yet I can't help it.
I enjoy every second of it and to quote,

3262
03:16:44,150 --> 03:16:49,150
imaGine if the people whose loved ones 
were over there fighting and dying and 

3263
03:16:49,150 --> 03:16:52,180
her churchill admitted that and you 
know,

3264
03:16:52,200 --> 03:16:57,200
one of the things that happens when you 
use churchill's account of these events 

3265
03:16:57,200 --> 03:17:01,011
that he played an important role in is 
you get all his excuses and you get his 

3266
03:17:01,011 --> 03:17:02,730
point of view and you get,
you know,

3267
03:17:02,740 --> 03:17:07,740
very one sided account of these affairs 
where churchill is the hero and he was 

3268
03:17:07,740 --> 03:17:11,331
right all along and if only people had 
listened to him and if only they hadn't 

3269
03:17:11,331 --> 03:17:11,331
screwed up,
his plans at all would have been great.

3270
03:17:12,440 --> 03:17:16,060
But there are very good historians,
Peter Hart and britain I find to be very

3271
03:17:16,061 --> 03:17:21,061
fair and he had this to say,
and he's not on the churchill was right 

3272
03:17:21,061 --> 03:17:25,560
bandwagon.
He wrote about the whole gullapalli 

3273
03:17:25,560 --> 03:17:28,231
affair.
Quote apologists for the gallipoli 

3274
03:17:28,231 --> 03:17:31,841
campaign have long tried to boast of 
what could have been with a heavy 

3275
03:17:31,841 --> 03:17:36,341
emphasis on if only this fails to 
recognize that the allies bought the 

3276
03:17:36,341 --> 03:17:41,321
campaign with levels of naval and 
military support that were considered 

3277
03:17:41,321 --> 03:17:42,260
acceptable until the turks defeated 
them.

3278
03:17:42,500 --> 03:17:47,500
Time and time again,
hamilton promised success again and 

3279
03:17:47,500 --> 03:17:47,500
again,
he failed.

3280
03:17:47,510 --> 03:17:52,510
Go liberally was one of a series of 
military easterner adventures launched 

3281
03:17:52,510 --> 03:17:57,311
without proper analysis of the global 
strategic situation without 

3282
03:17:57,311 --> 03:17:58,430
consideration of the local tactical 
situation,

3283
03:17:58,580 --> 03:18:03,580
ignoring logistical realities,
underestimating the strength of the 

3284
03:18:03,580 --> 03:18:07,271
opposition,
and predicted on a hugely optimistic 

3285
03:18:07,271 --> 03:18:08,120
assessment of the military capabilities 
of their own troops.

3286
03:18:08,360 --> 03:18:11,930
Not for nothing is hubris regarded as 
the english disease,

3287
03:18:12,230 --> 03:18:14,780
but the gallipoli campaign was a serious
matter.

3288
03:18:14,990 --> 03:18:18,170
vital resources have been drawn away 
from where it really mattered.

3289
03:18:18,350 --> 03:18:20,990
The turks were all but helpless if left 
on their own.

3290
03:18:21,320 --> 03:18:26,320
They had tried to launch an ambitious 
attack across the sinai desert on the 

3291
03:18:26,320 --> 03:18:26,930
suez canal,
but had been easily thwarted.

3292
03:18:27,230 --> 03:18:32,230
Gullapalli achieved nothing but to 
provide the turks with the opportunity 

3293
03:18:32,230 --> 03:18:36,341
to slaughter british and french troops 
and copious numbers in a situation in 

3294
03:18:36,341 --> 03:18:37,490
which everything was in the defenders 
favor.

3295
03:18:37,760 --> 03:18:42,760
Meanwhile,
back on the western front was the real 

3296
03:18:42,760 --> 03:18:43,650
enemy,
the german pyre and quote,

3297
03:18:44,840 --> 03:18:48,310
and by saying that [inaudible] was a 
side show

3298
03:18:48,730 --> 03:18:52,000
and blaming churchill in large part for 
the disaster.

3299
03:18:54,600 --> 03:18:57,270
While this tragic side show was going 
on,

3300
03:18:57,960 --> 03:19:02,960
another horrible disaster was as well.
This is a conflict after all full of 

3301
03:19:02,960 --> 03:19:06,060
horrible disasters,
but this one was somewhat different from

3302
03:19:06,061 --> 03:19:08,520
soldiers fighting it out on 
battlefields.

3303
03:19:08,910 --> 03:19:13,910
This one involved an entire people,
several entire peoples in fact,

3304
03:19:16,560 --> 03:19:21,560
and it is perhaps the most argued about 
case of genocide in world history.

3305
03:19:26,440 --> 03:19:28,990
In order to understand the context of 
what we're about to talk about,

3306
03:19:29,410 --> 03:19:34,410
we need to recall how much of a role the
idea of ethnic self-determination plays 

3307
03:19:35,770 --> 03:19:40,770
in leading up to the conditions that 
create the first world war and to the 

3308
03:19:40,770 --> 03:19:42,430
first world war itself.
Remember,

3309
03:19:42,431 --> 03:19:47,431
there are a bunch of centuries old pre 
20th century empires that sort of 

3310
03:19:48,281 --> 03:19:53,281
stumbled into the 20th century carrying 
all sorts of baggage from previous era's

3311
03:19:53,981 --> 03:19:58,981
with them.
Baggage that is in part tearing them 

3312
03:19:58,981 --> 03:20:00,160
apart and a lot of this baggage is 
ethnic.

3313
03:20:00,820 --> 03:20:05,820
Take.
The austrian hungarian empire is a 

3314
03:20:05,820 --> 03:20:08,221
perfect example.
Here's a multiethnic empire with a ton 

3315
03:20:08,221 --> 03:20:11,941
of different ethnicities in it that are 
presided over by a german slash 

3316
03:20:11,941 --> 03:20:16,201
hungarian elite on paper.
All these people are equal 

3317
03:20:16,201 --> 03:20:20,700
austro-hungarian subjects,
but if you happen to not be german or 

3318
03:20:20,700 --> 03:20:24,331
hungarian,
often you don't feel very equal and 

3319
03:20:24,331 --> 03:20:27,091
during this time period,
many different ethnic groups are either 

3320
03:20:27,091 --> 03:20:30,541
looking to create their own states for 
themselves or they're looking to join 

3321
03:20:31,420 --> 03:20:34,150
with ethnic brethren of theirs that have
already done this.

3322
03:20:35,380 --> 03:20:40,380
When the first world war is touched off,
let's recall it's touched off by a serb 

3323
03:20:40,380 --> 03:20:42,190
nationalist,
someone the slavs would probably look at

3324
03:20:42,191 --> 03:20:47,191
as a patriot,
but the austro-hungarian is looked at 

3325
03:20:47,191 --> 03:20:50,401
him as a terrorist and looked at any of 
their own people that wanted to join 

3326
03:20:50,401 --> 03:20:54,900
with Serbia.
A not that old country created by the 

3327
03:20:54,900 --> 03:20:56,080
ethnic serves.
Anyone who wanted to do that,

3328
03:20:56,081 --> 03:21:01,081
who was an austro-hungarian subject was 
now treasonous and an insurrectionist 

3329
03:21:01,081 --> 03:21:05,251
and a rebel.
And if you'rE actually in a war with 

3330
03:21:05,251 --> 03:21:07,531
that country,
you're a fifth columnist or a cancer on 

3331
03:21:07,531 --> 03:21:07,660
your nation

3332
03:21:09,190 --> 03:21:14,190
and there's no question that there are a
bunch of empires that are dealing with 

3333
03:21:14,201 --> 03:21:19,201
these problems.
And then there are a bunch that just 

3334
03:21:19,201 --> 03:21:19,201
sorta put those problems off.
Even the winners in the first world war,

3335
03:21:19,201 --> 03:21:23,971
for example,
britain and France are only going to 

3336
03:21:23,971 --> 03:21:24,730
push these questions farther down the 
road and after the next world war,

3337
03:21:24,910 --> 03:21:29,910
the british will be dealing with similar
situations in India and the french will 

3338
03:21:29,910 --> 03:21:30,820
be dealing with it in north africa and 
indochina,

3339
03:21:31,300 --> 03:21:36,300
but the ostrow hungarians and the 
russians and the ottoman empire deal 

3340
03:21:36,300 --> 03:21:39,751
with it now and it creates huge problems
and it does so in a realm that is 

3341
03:21:39,941 --> 03:21:44,941
historically extremely violent inducing 
ethnic in these old empires where people

3342
03:21:47,931 --> 03:21:51,500
have very long memories and everybody 
has,

3343
03:21:52,140 --> 03:21:57,140
you know,
atrocities that the other side is 

3344
03:21:57,140 --> 03:21:58,340
committed over the centuries that they 
can point to as a justification for what

3345
03:21:58,341 --> 03:21:59,600
they are going to do.
Now,

3346
03:22:01,240 --> 03:22:03,160
modern people can think,
for example,

3347
03:22:03,430 --> 03:22:08,430
of the situation in the middle east 
right now and how to sit down with 

3348
03:22:08,430 --> 03:22:08,910
anyone who's involved,
you know,

3349
03:22:08,950 --> 03:22:12,970
close at hand with those conflicts.
The first thing you find out is everyone

3350
03:22:12,971 --> 03:22:16,510
has a ton of bad things that they can 
point to that the other side did,

3351
03:22:16,690 --> 03:22:21,690
and after a while your head just spins 
because you don't even know where to 

3352
03:22:21,690 --> 03:22:24,301
start.
Everyone's got such long memories and 

3353
03:22:24,301 --> 03:22:24,490
there are so many bad things that have 
happened that they pointed.

3354
03:22:24,491 --> 03:22:27,640
The other side is being responsible for 
that.

3355
03:22:27,641 --> 03:22:32,641
you just don't even know how to solve 
that problem and untie that gordian 

3356
03:22:32,641 --> 03:22:36,481
knot,
but that's nothing compared to the 

3357
03:22:36,481 --> 03:22:38,941
ethnic memories of people in europe and 
anyone who remembers the breakup of the 

3358
03:22:38,951 --> 03:22:42,970
former yugoslavia and the middle 19 
nineties in a will remember.

3359
03:22:43,630 --> 03:22:46,930
That's a perfect example of how deep 
these ethnic tensions go.

3360
03:22:47,290 --> 03:22:52,290
You know,
we were all under the impression that 

3361
03:22:52,290 --> 03:22:54,660
that whole ethnic animosity between 
groups in those areas had been tamed and

3362
03:22:55,451 --> 03:22:58,000
that those fires had been completely put
out.

3363
03:22:58,810 --> 03:23:02,940
Little did we know that the heat under 
the ashes were smoldering the whole time

3364
03:23:02,950 --> 03:23:07,950
that all it took was a little gasoline 
poured on the smoldering heat for it to 

3365
03:23:07,950 --> 03:23:10,270
flare up and for horrible things to be 
done.

3366
03:23:10,420 --> 03:23:12,160
And then when you went and questioned 
anyone,

3367
03:23:12,280 --> 03:23:17,280
for example,
a serb or croat or a bosnian muslim 

3368
03:23:17,280 --> 03:23:20,731
about it,
they would point to the other side and 

3369
03:23:20,731 --> 03:23:21,820
talk about hundreds of years of awful 
things that they had done to them.

3370
03:23:22,360 --> 03:23:25,150
You don'T even know where to begin with 
ethnic hatred like that.

3371
03:23:26,200 --> 03:23:30,070
The worst situation of this kind that 
happens in the first world war,

3372
03:23:30,071 --> 03:23:32,980
although it happens in a lot of places.
Let's not forget,

3373
03:23:32,981 --> 03:23:37,981
during the 1915 retreat,
the russians did a lot of terrible 

3374
03:23:37,981 --> 03:23:37,981
things to poles and jews.
I mean,

3375
03:23:37,981 --> 03:23:42,631
these things get paled though in the 
history books by comparison with what 

3376
03:23:42,631 --> 03:23:44,260
happened to the christian minorities in 
the ottoman empire.

3377
03:23:46,270 --> 03:23:51,270
For example,
the greeks who have been inhabiting the 

3378
03:23:51,270 --> 03:23:54,580
anatolian plain of asia minor since the 
bronze age,

3379
03:23:55,210 --> 03:23:57,250
or the assyrian people,
the christian,

3380
03:23:57,251 --> 03:24:02,251
the syrian minority.
I'm in what's now kind of northern Iraq 

3381
03:24:02,251 --> 03:24:05,920
and who claim to be the descendants of 
the ancient assyrians.

3382
03:24:05,921 --> 03:24:08,020
Which if that's true,
that's a weird,

3383
03:24:08,021 --> 03:24:11,380
horrible karmic wheel of genocide coming
around,

3384
03:24:11,400 --> 03:24:13,240
hit them.
Because after all,

3385
03:24:13,241 --> 03:24:17,380
the biblical assyrians are one of the 
very early confirmable,

3386
03:24:17,750 --> 03:24:22,750
you know,
instigators of ethnic cleansing and 

3387
03:24:22,750 --> 03:24:22,750
genocide.
You can find ben,

3388
03:24:22,750 --> 03:24:26,800
of course,
the most famous of all the armenians.

3389
03:24:27,730 --> 03:24:32,730
The armenians are an ancient people who 
inhabit an area that during the first 

3390
03:24:34,001 --> 03:24:38,530
world war is kind of around where the 
borders of Russia and the ottoman empire

3391
03:24:38,531 --> 03:24:43,531
come together to historic arch enemies.
The armenians caught in the middle

3392
03:24:44,430 --> 03:24:47,610
and they always have been certain 
periods in history.

3393
03:24:47,611 --> 03:24:49,800
They've been able to form their own 
independent state.

3394
03:24:50,220 --> 03:24:51,410
For example,
when rome,

3395
03:24:51,460 --> 03:24:52,620
persia,
we're a little weak.

3396
03:24:52,621 --> 03:24:54,810
They could do that.
And then as soon as roman persian,

3397
03:24:55,200 --> 03:24:57,020
the ancient world got their act together
from.

3398
03:24:57,060 --> 03:25:00,390
They swallowed up Armenia.
Armenia was the first official christian

3399
03:25:00,391 --> 03:25:05,391
state,
which did not particularly make the 

3400
03:25:05,391 --> 03:25:05,391
ottomans enthusiastic.

3401
03:25:05,670 --> 03:25:10,670
It's kind of part of the reasons that 
the armenians in the ottoman empire had 

3402
03:25:10,670 --> 03:25:14,931
always been treated as second class 
citizens and they remind one of the jews

3403
03:25:16,080 --> 03:25:21,080
in Russia where periodically you would 
have these pogroms or these,

3404
03:25:21,300 --> 03:25:25,860
these incidents of violence breakout 
that are just appalling when men,

3405
03:25:25,861 --> 03:25:27,480
women,
and children would just be slaughtered.

3406
03:25:27,481 --> 03:25:28,680
I mean,
there were in 18,

3407
03:25:28,681 --> 03:25:29,300
95,
18,

3408
03:25:29,310 --> 03:25:30,650
96,
the sultan hammad,

3409
03:25:31,010 --> 03:25:33,450
um,
did awful things and from 50,000

3410
03:25:33,451 --> 03:25:36,630
to 300,000
armenians died and just that one.

3411
03:25:36,631 --> 03:25:38,790
And then there was another one a couple 
years later in another one,

3412
03:25:38,791 --> 03:25:40,440
a couple years after that,
in 1,909,

3413
03:25:40,450 --> 03:25:45,450
there was another one and the armenians 
are between a rock and a hard place 

3414
03:25:45,450 --> 03:25:47,700
because part of them live in what's the 
ottoman empire,

3415
03:25:47,940 --> 03:25:52,940
but part of their territory and ethnic 
group extends up into southern Russia 

3416
03:25:52,940 --> 03:25:55,620
and area by the way that Russia had been
taking over over the past century.

3417
03:25:55,860 --> 03:25:58,170
So it's,
it's sort of a battle ground area.

3418
03:25:58,620 --> 03:26:03,620
And you take this people that the 
ottoman turks had never been that 

3419
03:26:03,620 --> 03:26:05,400
enthusiastic about any way.
And then you start this war.

3420
03:26:05,401 --> 03:26:08,010
Remember the russians and the turks 
start fighting in late 19,

3421
03:26:08,011 --> 03:26:09,110
14,
early 1915.

3422
03:26:09,120 --> 03:26:11,220
And the turks get defeated by the 
russians.

3423
03:26:11,221 --> 03:26:16,221
They have that napoleonic retreat where 
the wolves are eating all the frozen 

3424
03:26:16,221 --> 03:26:19,041
people and a lot of that army that beat 
the turks in that battle were composed 

3425
03:26:19,801 --> 03:26:24,801
of armenians,
armenians from the russian side of the 

3426
03:26:24,801 --> 03:26:24,801
border,

3427
03:26:26,330 --> 03:26:30,860
a bunch of the ottoman troops in the 
defeated army or also armenians.

3428
03:26:31,190 --> 03:26:33,140
And to make matters even more 
complicated,

3429
03:26:33,141 --> 03:26:36,950
there were some armenian rebels who were
trying to create some sort of a state of

3430
03:26:36,951 --> 03:26:37,550
their own

3431
03:26:39,290 --> 03:26:44,290
and who can blame them by the way,
for wanting their own state after so 

3432
03:26:44,290 --> 03:26:47,111
much persecution for so long,
but the way the ottoman empire viewed 

3433
03:26:47,111 --> 03:26:47,570
these people,
you know,

3434
03:26:47,571 --> 03:26:51,620
what the best of times was unreliable 
once the russians,

3435
03:26:51,621 --> 03:26:53,680
when that important battle in late 19,
14,

3436
03:26:53,720 --> 03:26:56,870
early 1915 and the turks field their 
back up against the wall.

3437
03:26:57,110 --> 03:27:02,110
Now they begin to worry that the 
armenians on their side of the border 

3438
03:27:02,110 --> 03:27:03,540
are positively dangerous to them.
You know,

3439
03:27:03,560 --> 03:27:08,560
the ones who are loyal are potentially 
vulnerable to subversion or propaganda 

3440
03:27:09,650 --> 03:27:11,780
or maybe even having the guerrilla 
groups,

3441
03:27:12,220 --> 03:27:13,190
um,
you know,

3442
03:27:13,191 --> 03:27:18,191
coerce them into cooperation through age
old practices like killing collaborators

3443
03:27:18,531 --> 03:27:20,930
as it's called.
That's the best case scenario.

3444
03:27:21,050 --> 03:27:24,230
Worst case scenario,
you're armenian subjects are disloyal to

3445
03:27:24,231 --> 03:27:29,231
the core and are hoping,
waiting and actively working behind the 

3446
03:27:29,231 --> 03:27:32,831
scenes to help the russians when to the 
turkish government.

3447
03:27:32,991 --> 03:27:37,991
This is treason.
They are feeling like they they're 

3448
03:27:37,991 --> 03:27:40,820
either about to be or are being stabbed 
in the back and their government,

3449
03:27:41,020 --> 03:27:46,020
as we said,
never all that enthused about armenians 

3450
03:27:46,020 --> 03:27:48,811
anyway decided that a solution has to be
found and their solution is to get rid 

3451
03:27:48,811 --> 03:27:53,011
of the armenians.
If you believe the official turkish 

3452
03:27:53,011 --> 03:27:56,371
line,
getting rid of the armenians meant 

3453
03:27:56,371 --> 03:27:57,490
relocating them.
If you believe what the vast majority of

3454
03:27:57,520 --> 03:27:59,530
historians and obviously armenians 
believe,

3455
03:27:59,890 --> 03:28:01,450
getting rid of the meant killing them.

3456
03:28:03,050 --> 03:28:06,470
The process when it began with 
systematic one village after another,

3457
03:28:06,860 --> 03:28:11,860
it was done with a certain amount of 
understanding that it would be bad 

3458
03:28:11,860 --> 03:28:15,500
publicity.
The Christian Powers Russia mainly,

3459
03:28:15,501 --> 03:28:20,501
but also britain and France had 
oftentimes used persecution against the 

3460
03:28:20,501 --> 03:28:25,211
armenians and other christian groups as 
an excuse to intervene in the internal 

3461
03:28:25,211 --> 03:28:29,621
affairs of the ottoman empire.
That's the way the ottoman empire would 

3462
03:28:29,621 --> 03:28:29,621
look at it.
So to them,

3463
03:28:29,621 --> 03:28:33,401
there was all the reason in the world 
not to publicize that you were doing 

3464
03:28:33,401 --> 03:28:36,881
this and not make a big deal out of it.
The official line of the turkish 

3465
03:28:36,881 --> 03:28:40,391
government is that during these efforts 
to move the armenian people away from 

3466
03:28:40,391 --> 03:28:42,560
the trouble spot,
they won't be a problem if you move them

3467
03:28:42,561 --> 03:28:46,310
to say Syria.
A lot of them died through starvation,

3468
03:28:46,580 --> 03:28:49,670
through disease,
through hostile ethnic groups that never

3469
03:28:49,671 --> 03:28:50,900
liked them,
liked the courage,

3470
03:28:50,901 --> 03:28:54,440
deciding to take advantage and swoop in 
and killed a man and raped the women and

3471
03:28:54,500 --> 03:28:59,500
all the horrible things.
But there's so much evidence that this 

3472
03:28:59,500 --> 03:29:04,481
was done in the same sort of fashion 
that any one of us would recognize 

3473
03:29:04,820 --> 03:29:09,820
genocide being if it was the holocaust 
or Rwanda or it really reminds one of 

3474
03:29:09,820 --> 03:29:14,621
the former yugoslavia a lot.
And the turks are very sensitive about 

3475
03:29:14,621 --> 03:29:17,540
this and the armenians are very angry 
that they won't admit it.

3476
03:29:18,140 --> 03:29:23,140
You know,
this is where I get a little upset with 

3477
03:29:23,140 --> 03:29:23,140
this whole thing.

3478
03:29:23,140 --> 03:29:26,850
The idea of genocide as an official 
international crime only arose in the 

3479
03:29:27,940 --> 03:29:29,200
middle 19 forties.

3480
03:29:30,330 --> 03:29:35,330
And since that time,
that word has become a legal hot potato 

3481
03:29:35,330 --> 03:29:39,920
where it would,
if someone were actually convicted of 

3482
03:29:39,920 --> 03:29:42,780
genocide trigger all sorts of real world
ramifications.

3483
03:29:42,930 --> 03:29:45,600
And so everybody does everything they 
can for the most part,

3484
03:29:45,601 --> 03:29:49,710
unless it's a pariah state to find 
anything except genocide.

3485
03:29:49,930 --> 03:29:54,930
Well,
it's hundreds of thousands of people 

3486
03:29:54,930 --> 03:29:54,930
died.
Oh,

3487
03:29:54,930 --> 03:29:55,890
but it's merely a crime against humanity
because there was no intent.

3488
03:29:55,940 --> 03:30:00,940
I mean you have to.
It's become a legalistic word where all 

3489
03:30:00,940 --> 03:30:03,321
the different things have to be met and 
it's a big deal if they are countries 

3490
03:30:03,321 --> 03:30:04,770
can find themselves,
you know,

3491
03:30:04,800 --> 03:30:09,800
dealing with sanctions or calls for 
reparations or issues with alliances or 

3492
03:30:09,800 --> 03:30:10,030
trade deals.
And,

3493
03:30:10,290 --> 03:30:12,690
and Turkey didn't want that.
Nobody wants that.

3494
03:30:12,750 --> 03:30:17,750
I mean,
even in countries that acknowledged 

3495
03:30:17,750 --> 03:30:20,510
their genocidal practices at one time,
they were a group that have arisen in 

3496
03:30:20,510 --> 03:30:24,411
them,
are trying to get that overturned in 

3497
03:30:24,411 --> 03:30:24,411
Japan.

3498
03:30:24,411 --> 03:30:26,450
There are right wing nationalists now 
who are trying to now cover up and 

3499
03:30:26,450 --> 03:30:30,070
downplay japanese genocidal activities 
against China during the second world 

3500
03:30:30,070 --> 03:30:31,770
war.
It's the most normal thing in the world,

3501
03:30:32,160 --> 03:30:37,160
but we've all done it.
That's why it's hard for me to 

3502
03:30:37,160 --> 03:30:38,320
understand the turkish attitude that 
this is a bloated,

3503
03:30:38,360 --> 03:30:41,420
their pride,
if they hadn't committed the genocide,

3504
03:30:41,421 --> 03:30:46,421
they be what?
Like one of the only people on the 

3505
03:30:46,421 --> 03:30:46,421
planet have any consequences that 
hadn't.

3506
03:30:47,690 --> 03:30:49,610
It's part of the shared human 
experience.

3507
03:30:49,611 --> 03:30:51,290
As sad as that sounds.
Go.

3508
03:30:51,291 --> 03:30:54,710
Look at the old testament of the bible,
a book the jews,

3509
03:30:54,950 --> 03:30:59,950
christians and muslims all hold sacred.
The god of the old testament orders 

3510
03:31:00,590 --> 03:31:04,580
genocide after genocide,
after genocide,

3511
03:31:04,610 --> 03:31:08,120
kill everyone put the men,
women,

3512
03:31:08,270 --> 03:31:10,790
children,
and all the animals to the sword.

3513
03:31:12,230 --> 03:31:17,230
The reason it's in the old testament is 
because that was such a common behavior 

3514
03:31:17,230 --> 03:31:19,520
that those people at the time would have
understood it too.

3515
03:31:20,750 --> 03:31:25,750
I've often said about slavery,
that we all have slaved blood running 

3516
03:31:25,750 --> 03:31:29,021
through our ancestral veins somewhere.
same is true for genocide.

3517
03:31:29,600 --> 03:31:34,600
We've all had ancestors who were the 
victims of genocidal attacks and we've 

3518
03:31:34,731 --> 03:31:39,140
all had ancestors somewhere down the 
family tree who were the ones committing

3519
03:31:39,141 --> 03:31:42,440
the genocide in their book.
Why not killed them?

3520
03:31:42,441 --> 03:31:45,740
All professors,
daniel and clark mccauley,

3521
03:31:45,741 --> 03:31:50,741
right?
That one of the downsides of this whole 

3522
03:31:50,741 --> 03:31:53,441
thing is that we act as though that bad 
man or that bad people committed this 

3523
03:31:54,291 --> 03:31:56,570
unusual act when in reality,
as they say,

3524
03:31:57,110 --> 03:31:59,450
quote,
given the right circumstances,

3525
03:31:59,660 --> 03:32:04,660
normal human beings are all too ready to
kill by category and quote,

3526
03:32:05,990 --> 03:32:10,760
you will often hear the turks in their 
own defense when accused of the armenian

3527
03:32:10,761 --> 03:32:11,870
genocide say,
well,

3528
03:32:11,960 --> 03:32:16,960
look at what was happening to muslims 
and turkish folks who were in the 

3529
03:32:16,960 --> 03:32:21,401
balkans and who were being treated by 
those countries that had thrown off the 

3530
03:32:21,401 --> 03:32:26,081
turkish yoke to rape and murder and all 
these horrible things and displacement 

3531
03:32:26,081 --> 03:32:30,281
and all that is totally true,
but it doesn't alleviate turkish guilt 

3532
03:32:30,351 --> 03:32:31,610
in the armenian situation.

3533
03:32:31,610 --> 03:32:34,130
It just adds more people to the court 
docket.

3534
03:32:35,060 --> 03:32:40,060
What happeNed to the armenians and other
christians in the ottoman empire during 

3535
03:32:40,060 --> 03:32:41,600
this time,
including greeks and syrians,

3536
03:32:42,200 --> 03:32:47,200
was a tragedy between 500,001
point 5 million armenians died.

3537
03:32:49,430 --> 03:32:50,720
Women,
children,

3538
03:32:51,260 --> 03:32:52,850
men,
old people,

3539
03:32:52,910 --> 03:32:55,040
lots of rapes,
horrible stories.

3540
03:32:55,190 --> 03:32:58,010
Sounds like the einsatzgruppen under the
nazis.

3541
03:32:58,190 --> 03:33:03,190
Sounds like Rwanda.
Sounds like Indonesia sounds most like 

3542
03:33:03,190 --> 03:33:06,080
the former yugoslavia in the 19 nineties
on steroids,

3543
03:33:07,430 --> 03:33:10,790
but I don't blame the turks anymore than
I blame the rest of us for it.

3544
03:33:10,791 --> 03:33:15,791
That's human behavior and what's 
interesting is the armenian genocide 

3545
03:33:15,791 --> 03:33:20,741
actually overshadows something similar 
to it involving the russians retreating 

3546
03:33:20,961 --> 03:33:25,040
in 1915 from a german offensive in 
Poland and at gunpoint,

3547
03:33:25,041 --> 03:33:28,010
taking hundreds of thousands of poles 
and jews out,

3548
03:33:28,310 --> 03:33:30,050
and a lot of those people never 
returned.

3549
03:33:30,080 --> 03:33:35,080
They were seeing in the same way that 
the armenians were seen by the turks as 

3550
03:33:35,080 --> 03:33:38,650
unreliable,
disloyal elements likely to side with 

3551
03:33:38,650 --> 03:33:41,681
the germans and interestingly enough,
in a wonderful sort of karmic way,

3552
03:33:42,720 --> 03:33:47,720
a lot of the reports that are considered
to be the most reliable about what the 

3553
03:33:47,720 --> 03:33:50,820
armenians were going through come from 
the turks allies,

3554
03:33:51,180 --> 03:33:55,720
the germans,
chairman advisers and military officials

3555
03:33:56,320 --> 03:33:59,650
and ambassadors who are telling their 
own government about the terrible things

3556
03:33:59,651 --> 03:34:03,190
that are happening to the armenians in 
that country.

3557
03:34:03,640 --> 03:34:08,640
And then within a generation,
those stories will be coming out of 

3558
03:34:08,640 --> 03:34:08,640
Germany.

3559
03:34:09,940 --> 03:34:14,940
That's how endemic.
This whole idea of killing your enemies 

3560
03:34:15,401 --> 03:34:20,330
down to the last person are as terrible 
as this is.

3561
03:34:20,720 --> 03:34:23,300
That's the way we are as human beings

3562
03:34:25,120 --> 03:34:30,120
and killing your enemies down to the 
last person is not just beginning to 

3563
03:34:31,481 --> 03:34:36,481
look like the equation in these horrible
criminal genocides and starting to look 

3564
03:34:37,121 --> 03:34:41,170
like the equation.
You know in that algebraic problem.

3565
03:34:41,230 --> 03:34:46,230
If you're one of the military commanders
in this conflict of how you win the war 

3566
03:34:46,230 --> 03:34:47,380
itself,
not killing every man,

3567
03:34:47,381 --> 03:34:52,381
woman and child,
just killing every soldier on the other 

3568
03:34:52,381 --> 03:34:52,381
side.

3569
03:34:52,560 --> 03:34:57,560
You know,
after another horrible battle on the 

3570
03:34:57,560 --> 03:35:00,261
western front in 1915 when the allies 
lose a ton of people to gain literally 

3571
03:35:00,261 --> 03:35:04,851
not an inch of territory.
The french general baton becomes one of 

3572
03:35:04,851 --> 03:35:08,691
the first ally commanders to openly say 
that this war is not going to be won by 

3573
03:35:08,691 --> 03:35:12,741
some miraculous breakthrough or some 
tactical or strategic bit of brilliance 

3574
03:35:12,811 --> 03:35:15,630
that opens up into a flank or a 
breakthrough.

3575
03:35:15,900 --> 03:35:20,400
It's going to be won by killing more of 
the enemy than we lose ourselves.

3576
03:35:21,180 --> 03:35:26,180
The wars turning into a war of attrition
and while that might sound like an 

3577
03:35:26,180 --> 03:35:29,040
ultimate allied victory,
because if everybody kills,

3578
03:35:29,400 --> 03:35:32,220
you know one person on the other side 
until there no one left.

3579
03:35:32,221 --> 03:35:35,010
The allies have a lot more people than 
the central powers.

3580
03:35:35,400 --> 03:35:40,400
The problem with that little bit of 
mathematics is that the central powers 

3581
03:35:40,400 --> 03:35:44,210
are killing more allied troops and 
they're losing themselves and will do so

3582
03:35:44,310 --> 03:35:47,670
every single month until almost the end 
of the war.

3583
03:35:48,210 --> 03:35:53,130
So that mathematical equation is as yet 
unsolved and unpredictable.

3584
03:35:54,090 --> 03:35:59,090
But of course,
modern nations don't fight to the last 

3585
03:35:59,090 --> 03:36:00,810
man.
At some point they cry uncle,

3586
03:36:01,350 --> 03:36:06,350
which in this conflict has been ruled 
out by the allies signing those treaty 

3587
03:36:06,350 --> 03:36:07,020
saying no one will make a separate 
piece,

3588
03:36:07,470 --> 03:36:12,470
which means they'll fight until the 
political system or the armies or the 

3589
03:36:13,861 --> 03:36:16,860
will of the soldiers to resist 
collapses.

3590
03:36:17,640 --> 03:36:22,640
And by the end of 1915,
there's a coupLe of countries that look 

3591
03:36:22,640 --> 03:36:25,170
in real danger of having that happen.
And even the countries that look quite a

3592
03:36:25,171 --> 03:36:28,170
bit safer than Austria,
Hungary or Russia.

3593
03:36:28,171 --> 03:36:30,420
Look,
even they are showing,

3594
03:36:31,070 --> 03:36:32,910
you know,
cracks and vulnerabilities.

3595
03:36:32,911 --> 03:36:36,700
Can this war really go on for another 
year?

3596
03:36:37,500 --> 03:36:42,500
It's going to go on longer than that,
but not everyone is going to make it to 

3597
03:36:42,500 --> 03:36:42,500
the end.

3598
03:36:51,030 --> 03:36:56,030

3606
03:37:14,910 --> 03:37:19,120
like alice susanna,
and that's what the child prodigy and 

3607
03:37:19,791 --> 03:37:24,791
genius musical composer mozart is 
supposed to have answered when someone 

3608
03:37:24,791 --> 03:37:29,531
said,
how do you come up with your 

3609
03:37:29,531 --> 03:37:29,600
compositions in a start with the piano 
and then build off of that,

3610
03:37:29,601 --> 03:37:31,550
or do you start with the structure and 
then fill in the middle or.

3611
03:37:31,760 --> 03:37:34,100
and he's supposed to have said that it 
comes to him.

3612
03:37:34,530 --> 03:37:39,530
Gleick alice,
suzanne amman at the same time all 

3613
03:37:39,530 --> 03:37:42,640
together.
And that phrase keeps popping into my 

3614
03:37:42,640 --> 03:37:45,611
head because that's the biggest 
challenge in telling this first world 

3615
03:37:45,611 --> 03:37:49,511
war story.
The second biggest challenge is the 

3616
03:37:49,511 --> 03:37:51,820
ungodly amount of material that is 
produced from many different countries 

3617
03:37:51,820 --> 03:37:56,621
and viewpoints about this story.
I've never been so overwhelmed with 

3618
03:37:56,621 --> 03:37:58,640
material as I have been for this and 
it's all controversial,

3619
03:37:58,641 --> 03:38:03,641
so you really need to read a bunch of 
different authors and viewpoints to to 

3620
03:38:03,641 --> 03:38:07,160
get a sort of a nice broad view of some 
of these topics.

3621
03:38:07,670 --> 03:38:12,670
But the stories can't even be 
compartmentalized because they affect 

3622
03:38:12,670 --> 03:38:15,641
each other.
What's going on in the eastern front 

3623
03:38:15,641 --> 03:38:18,041
affects outcomes on the western front,
which affect outcomes in the 

3624
03:38:18,041 --> 03:38:21,371
mediterranean theatre.
And so you can't even tell the stories 

3625
03:38:21,371 --> 03:38:26,040
and the separately.
They all have to kind of weave together 

3626
03:38:26,040 --> 03:38:28,070
and it's really easy with this much 
going on to lose track of the story.

3627
03:38:29,030 --> 03:38:34,030
So I thought we would have a rare little
recap as to where we are right now.

3628
03:38:34,521 --> 03:38:39,521
Sort of broad trends to get us up to 
speed and a few thoughts from the last 

3629
03:38:39,711 --> 03:38:43,490
show that I'd like to just throw in 
little extra fluff here at the end,

3630
03:38:43,491 --> 03:38:48,491
no extra charge.
Just bring us up to speed and make sure 

3631
03:38:48,491 --> 03:38:51,851
I've covered them.
I have a list of things I want to make 

3632
03:38:51,851 --> 03:38:51,851
sure I get through.

3633
03:38:51,851 --> 03:38:53,020
I'd hate to get through this whole show 
and say,

3634
03:38:53,080 --> 03:38:54,580
oh,
I left that out.

3635
03:38:55,930 --> 03:39:00,930
Nonetheless,
are quick recap can be done relatively 

3636
03:39:00,930 --> 03:39:01,780
simply.
The war breaks out in august,

3637
03:39:01,781 --> 03:39:02,830
19,
14.

3638
03:39:03,340 --> 03:39:05,470
A bunch of these countries had been 
ready for it,

3639
03:39:05,471 --> 03:39:07,480
predicting it.
They mobilized quickly.

3640
03:39:07,481 --> 03:39:10,270
It's all on a timescale and everybody 
launches.

3641
03:39:10,271 --> 03:39:15,271
They're prewar battle plans,
which for the germans is most famously 

3642
03:39:15,271 --> 03:39:18,010
called the schlieffen plan,
advanced through Belgium in a wide arc.

3643
03:39:18,280 --> 03:39:23,280
Smash the french armies on the head 
while you're keeping them occupied to 

3644
03:39:23,280 --> 03:39:25,630
the front as well.
That doesn't go too well.

3645
03:39:25,930 --> 03:39:27,460
It does for a while.
I mean the.

3646
03:39:27,510 --> 03:39:32,510
The armies clash and the first month of 
the war is commonly referred to as the 

3647
03:39:32,510 --> 03:39:37,201
battle of the frontiers.
When you get these 19th century tactics 

3648
03:39:37,201 --> 03:39:40,400
running into 20th century,
mechanized warfare,

3649
03:39:40,760 --> 03:39:44,450
which leads to the worst single month in
terms of casualties that you're going to

3650
03:39:44,451 --> 03:39:49,451
get in the whole war because you're not 
going to see a lot of cavalry charges 

3651
03:39:49,911 --> 03:39:54,911
against machine guns and artillery 
positions after the first month of the 

3652
03:39:54,911 --> 03:39:54,911
war.

3653
03:39:54,911 --> 03:39:59,000
That's when the really mindblowingly 
shocking things.

3654
03:39:59,001 --> 03:40:03,070
I mean guys with armor and swords and 
white gloves and red pants and you know,

3655
03:40:03,210 --> 03:40:04,430
bayonet,
charging,

3656
03:40:04,460 --> 03:40:09,460
prepared positions.
I mean the whole thing is is cookie and 

3657
03:40:09,460 --> 03:40:10,700
that lasts for about a month.
The next month is what happens after the

3658
03:40:10,701 --> 03:40:15,701
germans lose the battle of the marne and
there schlieffen plan is broken and so 

3659
03:40:15,701 --> 03:40:20,291
the second month of the wars then 
basically running away from their 

3660
03:40:20,291 --> 03:40:21,290
earlier positions,
trying to find a place to regroup,

3661
03:40:21,410 --> 03:40:26,410
finding a really good place to regroup 
on the other side of the river ane and 

3662
03:40:26,410 --> 03:40:29,180
digging in and the allies following 
them,

3663
03:40:29,540 --> 03:40:34,540
unable to take those wonderful positions
on the other side of the river ane and 

3664
03:40:34,540 --> 03:40:38,660
digging in themselves.
Inaugurating officially trench warfare.

3665
03:40:39,710 --> 03:40:41,840
then you have the so called race to the 
sea.

3666
03:40:42,110 --> 03:40:47,110
When the germans and the french and the 
british who don't want to run into each 

3667
03:40:47,110 --> 03:40:48,530
other's prepared defenses anymore,
start trying to find a flank in the only

3668
03:40:48,560 --> 03:40:53,560
open part of the battle line left from 
the river ane up north towards the see 

3669
03:40:54,530 --> 03:40:57,710
both sides reached the sea before they 
find a flag.

3670
03:40:58,040 --> 03:41:03,040
They have a couple of terrible battles 
including the first battle of april up 

3671
03:41:03,040 --> 03:41:06,701
there,
and then we settled down to the 1915 

3672
03:41:06,701 --> 03:41:11,081
warfare basically,
which is going to involve both sides 

3673
03:41:11,081 --> 03:41:13,890
launching offensives that don't do 
anything and that if you read the book,

3674
03:41:13,891 --> 03:41:15,620
sometimes they can make them exciting.
Oh,

3675
03:41:15,621 --> 03:41:18,800
they almost broke through and all if 
they've only been modern communication,

3676
03:41:19,130 --> 03:41:24,130
but the bottom line is thE bottom line.
You have a bunch of battles during 1915 

3677
03:41:24,130 --> 03:41:27,230
on the western front.
Nothing changes on the eastern front.

3678
03:41:27,500 --> 03:41:31,220
Nothing changes either,
but a lot of movement happens.

3679
03:41:31,280 --> 03:41:33,440
A lot of people die.
A lot of movement happens.

3680
03:41:33,740 --> 03:41:38,740
The overall strategic situation remains 
the same because when the russians and 

3681
03:41:38,740 --> 03:41:40,220
the germans clash right at the war 
start,

3682
03:41:40,221 --> 03:41:42,770
the russians get crushed in the couple 
of big battles.

3683
03:41:42,771 --> 03:41:45,950
Tannenberg mazarine lakes.
But then they beat the ostroW,

3684
03:41:45,951 --> 03:41:47,710
hungarians,
the serbians beat,

3685
03:41:47,711 --> 03:41:52,711
the austro-hungarian whole bunch of 
stuff happens when you turn around and 

3686
03:41:52,711 --> 03:41:53,870
subtract all the deaths and all the 
movement and everything else.

3687
03:41:53,870 --> 03:41:56,840
The situation is the same.
The russians are there,

3688
03:41:57,020 --> 03:42:00,680
they're not defeated.
They can replace all their losses and if

3689
03:42:00,681 --> 03:42:05,681
you really want to chase them,
they'll run all the way back to moscow 

3690
03:42:05,681 --> 03:42:06,410
like they did against napoleon and like 
they'll do against hitler.

3691
03:42:06,500 --> 03:42:11,500
And do you really want to follow them 
all the way back there so they don't 

3692
03:42:11,500 --> 03:42:13,880
have trench warfare.
They have movement warfare,

3693
03:42:14,180 --> 03:42:17,360
but the movement's not ending anything.
And then of course,

3694
03:42:17,600 --> 03:42:21,170
because the russians and the turks start
getting into it down in the south,

3695
03:42:21,590 --> 03:42:26,590
the russians asked the allies for help,
which leads to winston churchill's 

3696
03:42:26,590 --> 03:42:30,161
cabal,
having yet another good argument to 

3697
03:42:30,161 --> 03:42:32,501
argue that maybe we should take the 
dardanelles with all these pre 

3698
03:42:32,501 --> 03:42:33,630
dreadnought battleships and then the 
dardanelles happen.

3699
03:42:33,870 --> 03:42:36,300
Now here's where we can kind of add the 
fluff.

3700
03:42:36,301 --> 03:42:41,301
I was just promising you because 
remember one of the sidebar hopes with 

3701
03:42:41,301 --> 03:42:45,741
this dardanelles campaign is that it 
might influence some of those countries 

3702
03:42:45,741 --> 03:42:48,180
down in that region that hadn't decided 
which side to join yet,

3703
03:42:48,181 --> 03:42:50,550
but it was obvious that they were sort 
of taking bids,

3704
03:42:50,820 --> 03:42:52,200
Italy most among them.

3705
03:42:52,440 --> 03:42:57,440
They liked the allied bead better.
They saw the dardanelles campaign 

3706
03:42:57,440 --> 03:42:58,800
looking pretty strong back in may,
19,

3707
03:42:58,801 --> 03:43:03,801
15,
you know when there were landings and 

3708
03:43:03,801 --> 03:43:05,601
troops assaulting the heights every day 
and it looked like britain and France 

3709
03:43:05,601 --> 03:43:06,210
were strong.
So the italians joined the war.

3710
03:43:06,720 --> 03:43:11,720
They instantly attack the ostrow 
hungarians at really the only good spot 

3711
03:43:11,720 --> 03:43:16,020
on their board or to do that because the
rest of their borders basically the alps

3712
03:43:16,320 --> 03:43:18,870
and basically the austro-hungarian 
hungarians have the high ground.

3713
03:43:18,871 --> 03:43:21,750
Although they find and have found 
recently,

3714
03:43:21,751 --> 03:43:26,751
it's,
it's almost like something out of the 

3715
03:43:26,751 --> 03:43:26,751
old captain America comic books,
you know,

3716
03:43:26,751 --> 03:43:31,311
with captain America frozen in the snow.
except of course he was alive when they 

3717
03:43:31,311 --> 03:43:35,220
defrosted them.
These poor austrian and italian soldiers

3718
03:43:35,221 --> 03:43:38,400
that they're finding with these glaciers
melting up in the alps,

3719
03:43:38,670 --> 03:43:43,670
in these caves.
And I mean they look perfect like they 

3720
03:43:43,670 --> 03:43:43,670
were frozen yesterday,
their uniforms,

3721
03:43:43,670 --> 03:43:46,020
their weapons,
their facial characteristics,

3722
03:43:46,021 --> 03:43:46,530
everything.

3723
03:43:46,530 --> 03:43:47,460
I mean,
it's crazy.

3724
03:43:47,461 --> 03:43:51,360
It's like a time capsule of the most 
grotesque kind.

3725
03:43:52,200 --> 03:43:54,660
Nevertheless,
the one area that's good for fighting at

3726
03:43:54,661 --> 03:43:56,800
least compared to the alps,
is on the river.

3727
03:43:56,801 --> 03:44:01,801
He songs though.
So the italians attack the 

3728
03:44:01,801 --> 03:44:02,610
austro-hungarian right away at the river
is sancho and lose.

3729
03:44:03,090 --> 03:44:05,160
So then they attack agaIn on the 
riversand.

3730
03:44:05,260 --> 03:44:07,600
So this will be called the second battle
of the riversand.

3731
03:44:07,610 --> 03:44:09,780
So when they lose again,
they do it again.

3732
03:44:09,810 --> 03:44:11,940
Third battle of the riversand.
So they do it again.

3733
03:44:11,941 --> 03:44:16,941
The fourth battle of the river.
So by the last year of the award there 

3734
03:44:16,941 --> 03:44:20,061
on the twelfth battle of the reverse,
monzo and hundreds of thousands have 

3735
03:44:20,061 --> 03:44:21,120
died.
And in fact,

3736
03:44:21,300 --> 03:44:24,960
in only six months of warfare,
the italians will have 200,000

3737
03:44:24,961 --> 03:44:29,340
casualties and are quickly playing catch
up with the rest of the powers.

3738
03:44:29,490 --> 03:44:31,410
I should point out something about 
casualties to.

3739
03:44:31,411 --> 03:44:33,690
We keep using that term and it's worth 
defining it.

3740
03:44:34,230 --> 03:44:36,990
casualties is a military term,
as many of you know,

3741
03:44:37,200 --> 03:44:39,890
and it's simply refers to the loss of 
battles.

3742
03:44:39,891 --> 03:44:44,891
StrenGth.
So if you're a general and it's your 

3743
03:44:44,891 --> 03:44:44,891
army,
we're talking about casualties,

3744
03:44:44,891 --> 03:44:49,481
simply means the number of people you 
don't have available to fight those 

3745
03:44:49,481 --> 03:44:51,150
who'd been killed,
those who have been wounded,

3746
03:44:51,300 --> 03:44:53,610
those who have been captured,
and those who are missing.

3747
03:44:53,880 --> 03:44:56,490
So when I say casualties,
that's what it means.

3748
03:44:56,491 --> 03:44:58,650
Although missing in this war usually 
means dead.

3749
03:44:59,070 --> 03:45:00,330
If I say dead,
well,

3750
03:45:00,690 --> 03:45:04,320
that means killed in action.
So the italians,

3751
03:45:04,321 --> 03:45:06,210
200,000
casualties within six months,

3752
03:45:06,510 --> 03:45:09,540
the other power that gets into the war 
does so in october,

3753
03:45:09,840 --> 03:45:14,840
and it's the bulgarians,
another one of these powers that 

3754
03:45:14,840 --> 03:45:17,511
churchill and his friends at hope to 
convince to join the allied side when 

3755
03:45:17,511 --> 03:45:18,240
they saw how the dardanelles campaign 
was going,

3756
03:45:18,241 --> 03:45:23,241
but by october the dardanelles campaigns
really going poorly and the bulgarians 

3757
03:45:23,241 --> 03:45:25,500
had been promised good land and they 
don't like the serbs anyway.

3758
03:45:25,590 --> 03:45:28,140
So they joined with the germans and the 
austrian hungarians,

3759
03:45:28,260 --> 03:45:30,640
all three of them promptly attack 
Serbia,

3760
03:45:30,950 --> 03:45:33,040
um,
and knock them out of the war.

3761
03:45:33,310 --> 03:45:38,310
And there'll be this story,
this harrowing story of the serbian 

3762
03:45:38,310 --> 03:45:38,310
army,
you know,

3763
03:45:38,310 --> 03:45:42,990
going all the way through Albania and 
the mountain passes like a bunch of 

3764
03:45:42,990 --> 03:45:44,290
wraiths starving until they reached the 
sea.

3765
03:45:44,291 --> 03:45:47,650
And there'll be evacuated by french and 
british warships to fight another day.

3766
03:45:49,050 --> 03:45:51,330
The one thing I wasn't sure if I 
mentioned in the story,

3767
03:45:51,370 --> 03:45:52,980
you know,
we talked about the second battle of eep

3768
03:45:52,981 --> 03:45:57,550
or where the germans used poison gas for
the first time in a successful way.

3769
03:45:57,551 --> 03:45:59,740
It was used on the eastern front in a 
weird way once,

3770
03:46:00,090 --> 03:46:05,090
um,
but after the second battle of eep are 

3771
03:46:05,090 --> 03:46:05,500
the allies start using gas to.
And by the end of 1915,

3772
03:46:05,770 --> 03:46:10,770
the standard mix of shells is you want 
some high explosive in your mix and you 

3773
03:46:10,770 --> 03:46:15,511
want some shrapnel shells and your mix,
which are like giant balls filled with 

3774
03:46:15,511 --> 03:46:18,991
tiny little beebees.
And when they explode it's like a giant 

3775
03:46:18,991 --> 03:46:21,901
hand grenade going off.
And then the last gels you want mixed 

3776
03:46:21,901 --> 03:46:22,480
into your little triad of,
um,

3777
03:46:22,860 --> 03:46:25,040
you know,
horrific ness are your gas shell.

3778
03:46:25,041 --> 03:46:26,800
So gas high,
explosive in shrapnel.

3779
03:46:26,801 --> 03:46:30,400
You shoot it all at the same time,
it makes a nasty little cocktail for the

3780
03:46:30,401 --> 03:46:31,510
poor troops on the ground,

3781
03:46:32,550 --> 03:46:37,550
so everyone's got gas and everybody's 
wearing gas masks now and you end up 

3782
03:46:37,550 --> 03:46:39,300
with these images that are still,
to my mind,

3783
03:46:39,360 --> 03:46:44,360
the greatest images of the first world 
war because they say the most when 

3784
03:46:44,360 --> 03:46:44,360
you'll see,
for example,

3785
03:46:44,360 --> 03:46:48,390
I love the one that shows a german 
cavalry,

3786
03:46:48,420 --> 03:46:53,420
lancer in 1969,
1917 who's wearing the stall helm,

3787
03:46:54,421 --> 03:46:59,421
which will come into vogue in 1916,
which is basically the same basic 

3788
03:46:59,421 --> 03:47:03,771
design.
You'll see the german army having the 

3789
03:47:03,771 --> 03:47:05,451
second world war,
so he's wearing like a german wehrmacht 

3790
03:47:05,451 --> 03:47:08,361
helmet with a lance on a horse and 
wearing a gas mask.

3791
03:47:08,940 --> 03:47:13,940
He's like half medieval knighT and half 
storm trooper from star wars and that to

3792
03:47:14,701 --> 03:47:19,701
me encapsulates what this war is.
These meetinGs of the modern world with 

3793
03:47:19,701 --> 03:47:22,020
the premodern world,
like a historical estuary,

3794
03:47:22,021 --> 03:47:24,570
like I said,
and in fact,

3795
03:47:24,840 --> 03:47:29,840
you know it's,
it's uber modern because really there 

3796
03:47:29,840 --> 03:47:31,770
hasn't been a major war fought with gas 
since this time period.

3797
03:47:31,771 --> 03:47:36,771
I mean,
there have been incidents of chemical 

3798
03:47:36,771 --> 03:47:36,771
weapons and gas use,
but you've never had the major.

3799
03:47:36,771 --> 03:47:38,070
I mean the second world war,
there was none of this.

3800
03:47:39,910 --> 03:47:44,910
Also,
it should be obvious that there have 

3801
03:47:44,910 --> 03:47:46,441
been several theaters that have not 
gotten much or perhaps any attention 

3802
03:47:46,441 --> 03:47:50,520
from yours truly,
and it's not because I don't find them 

3803
03:47:50,520 --> 03:47:53,640
interesting.
I mean I think you could do a whole 

3804
03:47:53,640 --> 03:47:55,300
podcast just on the african experience 
in the first world war,

3805
03:47:55,690 --> 03:47:59,110
but it's not important to the outcome of
the first world war.

3806
03:47:59,111 --> 03:48:01,330
So when you have to chop in places for 
time,

3807
03:48:01,331 --> 03:48:04,660
these are long enough already.
You naturally look at the pacific in the

3808
03:48:04,661 --> 03:48:08,080
first world war or africa because it 
didn't affect the outcome.

3809
03:48:08,590 --> 03:48:13,590
What had more of an effect on the 
outcome are the soldiers from those two 

3810
03:48:13,590 --> 03:48:17,890
areas that were trucked into places like
the western front and who fought there.

3811
03:48:18,220 --> 03:48:21,670
Lots of north africans,
lots of subsaharan africans,

3812
03:48:21,790 --> 03:48:26,790
lots of people from the far east fought 
on the western front and at places like 

3813
03:48:26,790 --> 03:48:30,230
the dardanelles and eventually at slomka
and places like that.

3814
03:48:30,530 --> 03:48:35,530
So in a funny way,
the place where africans and asians had 

3815
03:48:35,901 --> 03:48:40,901
the most impact on the war going one way
or the other was the same western front 

3816
03:48:41,180 --> 03:48:46,180
that we normally think of as being a 
british french canadian sort of preserve

3817
03:48:46,521 --> 03:48:51,521
and down the road and american one.
so by the end of 1915 you basically have

3818
03:48:53,961 --> 03:48:57,500
a static situation.
western front stays unchanged.

3819
03:48:57,710 --> 03:49:02,710
Eastern front keeps moving around,
but everybody's still standing there 

3820
03:49:02,710 --> 03:49:06,410
facing each other down in Turkey.
The war has been extended to down there,

3821
03:49:06,411 --> 03:49:11,411
but it's just stable to one of the 
reasons this is called the gear of 

3822
03:49:11,411 --> 03:49:15,941
stalemate in the first world war,
if you want to talk about something new 

3823
03:49:15,941 --> 03:49:17,630
that has happened,
helmets have started arriving.

3824
03:49:18,320 --> 03:49:20,480
We mentioned the german stall helm a 
minute ago.

3825
03:49:20,630 --> 03:49:25,630
The first one is the french helmet.
Then the british metal helmet than the 

3826
03:49:25,630 --> 03:49:28,901
german one appears and it's one of those
things that doesn't seem like a big 

3827
03:49:28,901 --> 03:49:32,771
deal,
but all of those helmet designs will be 

3828
03:49:32,771 --> 03:49:33,860
the basic design that the second world 
war helmets come from.

3829
03:49:34,040 --> 03:49:37,730
So they'll all look very familiar and be
in vogue for quite a while.

3830
03:49:37,731 --> 03:49:40,070
At least in their basic look,
the german one changes,

3831
03:49:40,071 --> 03:49:41,390
for example,
they all change a little,

3832
03:49:42,380 --> 03:49:45,680
but also because it boggles the mind a 
little bit,

3833
03:49:45,710 --> 03:49:50,710
doesn't it,
that you don't get your first metal 

3834
03:49:50,710 --> 03:49:53,081
helmet really till late 1915,
which means all these people have been 

3835
03:49:53,081 --> 03:49:57,551
fighting the most artillery intensive 
war in human history by far with cloth 

3836
03:49:59,420 --> 03:50:04,420
hats on their heads,
digging holes in the ground where the 

3837
03:50:04,911 --> 03:50:09,911
only thing that's exposed to fire is the
top of your head and it's covered by a 

3838
03:50:10,311 --> 03:50:15,311
hat and forget the obvious thing about 
like shrapnel exploding in the air and 

3839
03:50:15,311 --> 03:50:20,000
just hitting you in the head.
So many of these shells don't come all 

3840
03:50:20,000 --> 03:50:23,591
that close to you.
They just Blow tons of rocks and stuff 

3841
03:50:23,591 --> 03:50:25,430
up in the air that then come down and 
land on your head.

3842
03:50:26,240 --> 03:50:31,240
How many casualties from the first year 
of the war could you attribute to the 

3843
03:50:31,641 --> 03:50:33,410
fact that none of these troops had metal
helmets?

3844
03:50:33,411 --> 03:50:38,411
It's crazy to think about and crazy to 
think that it took them a year to come 

3845
03:50:38,411 --> 03:50:39,350
up with that more than a year.

3846
03:50:41,720 --> 03:50:46,720
Finally,
and I think this firmly belonGs in the 

3847
03:50:46,720 --> 03:50:47,180
casualty area when we're discussing 
casualties,

3848
03:50:47,960 --> 03:50:52,100
modern medicine has changed the 
situation at this conflict and if you're

3849
03:50:52,220 --> 03:50:57,220
studying military history,
you'll notice a very interesting change 

3850
03:50:57,220 --> 03:51:01,781
in the way the casualty death too.
Wounded figures show up in this 

3851
03:51:01,781 --> 03:51:05,381
conflict.
I'm normally the number of people 

3852
03:51:05,381 --> 03:51:07,460
wounded and the number of people who die
are pretty close together.

3853
03:51:07,490 --> 03:51:10,390
I mean take the crimean war that 
happened in the 18 fifties.

3854
03:51:10,610 --> 03:51:14,960
More people died from disease than from 
combat related wounds.

3855
03:51:14,961 --> 03:51:19,961
That might've been a little extreme but 
not that far off the norm by the first 

3856
03:51:19,961 --> 03:51:24,251
world war.
That changes immensely and it's because 

3857
03:51:24,251 --> 03:51:25,650
the medical situation has been 
revolutionized.

3858
03:51:25,680 --> 03:51:30,680
modern military medicine really begins 
in the first world war and a lot of 

3859
03:51:30,680 --> 03:51:31,920
these doctors,
especially on the western front,

3860
03:51:32,220 --> 03:51:37,220
our doctors from private practice who 
have been drafted or who joined and 

3861
03:51:37,220 --> 03:51:40,140
volunteered for the war effort,
they're often doing surgeries right near

3862
03:51:40,141 --> 03:51:40,650
the front.

3863
03:51:40,980 --> 03:51:43,080
These are people who live in the modern 
era.

3864
03:51:43,081 --> 03:51:48,081
When medIcine is starting to be pretty 
darn good and it completely changes the 

3865
03:51:48,081 --> 03:51:48,081
game.
I mean,

3866
03:51:48,081 --> 03:51:52,971
these people are not just able to save 
lives and this is sort of a mixed 

3867
03:51:52,971 --> 03:51:52,980
blessing,
I guess if you're a soldier,

3868
03:51:53,220 --> 03:51:58,220
but they will be able for the nation 
states that they work for to send a lot 

3869
03:51:58,220 --> 03:52:02,421
of these damaged soldiers back to fight 
again another day and sometimes multiple

3870
03:52:03,121 --> 03:52:08,121
times.
That ends up increasing the ability of 

3871
03:52:08,121 --> 03:52:11,991
many of these states to keep fighting 
past where they otherwise would have 

3872
03:52:11,991 --> 03:52:12,990
been able to.
I mean all you have to do for example,

3873
03:52:12,991 --> 03:52:15,060
is look at the burn rate on some of 
these armies.

3874
03:52:15,420 --> 03:52:18,720
By the end of 1915.
By October,

3875
03:52:18,720 --> 03:52:22,650
1915,
the russians are losing 235,000

3876
03:52:22,651 --> 03:52:27,651
men every month.
By the end of 1915,

3877
03:52:28,341 --> 03:52:33,341
17 months into the war,
the total russian casualties are over 2 

3878
03:52:33,341 --> 03:52:36,950
million men and even though they could 
replace the human beings,

3879
03:52:37,430 --> 03:52:41,660
what they can't do is replace the morale
of the people in the capital.

3880
03:52:42,080 --> 03:52:45,860
The czar tells his french and british 
counterparts at the end of 1915 that the

3881
03:52:45,861 --> 03:52:50,480
population has turned pacifistic an anti
allied.

3882
03:52:51,950 --> 03:52:56,950
Meanwhile,
the western allies are having their own 

3883
03:52:56,950 --> 03:52:57,350
problem.
The soldiers in the trenches starting to

3884
03:52:57,351 --> 03:53:02,030
get a little uppity about their 
willingness to continue suicidal attacks

3885
03:53:02,120 --> 03:53:07,120
endlessly.
That's not a good sign commander of the 

3886
03:53:07,120 --> 03:53:12,101
german forces.
Creating strategy is deciding that if 

3887
03:53:12,101 --> 03:53:15,701
they're really in a war of attrition,
why not design the battles to kill the 

3888
03:53:15,701 --> 03:53:19,871
most people instead of having 
breakthroughs and maneuvers and all 

3889
03:53:19,871 --> 03:53:22,901
that,
and eric von falcon hine creates a 

3890
03:53:22,901 --> 03:53:26,831
killing ground to invite the french 
nation to bleed itself white in the big 

3891
03:53:28,281 --> 03:53:33,281
fleets.
Finally come out to play and new 

3892
03:53:33,281 --> 03:53:36,491
technologies debut whose job it is to 
break this log jam of trenches,

3893
03:53:38,840 --> 03:53:43,310
machine guns,
barbed wire and gas.

3894
03:53:44,980 --> 03:53:48,940
The year in 1916 is sometimes called the
breaker of nations.

3895
03:53:49,610 --> 03:53:54,610
There's going to be some nations that 
suffer some mortal wounds before that 

3896
03:53:54,610 --> 03:53:56,350
year is over.
All that and more.

3897
03:53:57,040 --> 03:54:00,220
In part four of blueprint for 
armageddon.
