It's hardcore history.

8
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:34,030
I've said before that one of the 
wonderful side benefits of a gig like 

9
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,841
this is the chance to speak to people 
whose work you really admire and talked 

10
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:42,631
to them about it,
and in this case I have a guest on the 

11
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:45,401
program today who is a source,
somebody that we use in our work and 

12
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:49,841
when we did blueprint for Armageddon,
he was sort of my go to guy in terms of 

13
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:56,351
somebody that I knew could add a 
different dimension to the storytelling 

14
00:00:56,901 --> 00:01:01,901
by having a letter or a document or a 
quote or something that was just,

15
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,260
you know,
so visceral or perfect or emotional or 

16
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,641
that in one short little paragraph 
managed to capture such a poignant point

17
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:17,870
that just sort of made the whole section
of the piece.

18
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:22,871
I mean Peter Hearts work is finding 
emotional nuggets that just knock you 

19
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:27,911
over and then incorporating them into 
the story in a way where they not only 

20
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:33,041
have the most impact,
but they managed to add a part of the 

21
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:33,470
story that often gets missed.

22
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,760
If you're telling,
for example,

23
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,030
a story on the first World War,
which is Peter Harte specialty.

24
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,420
It is so easy to get yourself locked 
into the giant troop movements in the 

25
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,710
big decisions made at headquarters and 
all this.

26
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Sometimes you can go the total opposite 
extreme and it's easy to get caught up 

27
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,220
in the diary of this one soldier or this
one nurse or something like that,

28
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,990
but to be able to blend the two in a way
that helps you understand,

29
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:04,991
for example,
how the decision's made at headquarters 

30
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:06,110
with all those high muckety mucks 
thinking about things abstractly,

31
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,120
how they influence and intersect with 
the lives of some poor guy,

32
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,410
mortally wounded in a shell hole,
writing his last letter back to his wife

33
00:02:15,411 --> 00:02:20,411
and family.
It's an art and I think Peter Hart does 

34
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:24,761
it as well or better,
especially on the subject of the first 

35
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:25,490
World War than anyone I've ever read.

36
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,660
So you get to see me enjoying my 
byproduct.

37
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,360
The best aspect of this Gig,
the chance to talk to people whose work 

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,940
you admire.
People like Peter Hart,

39
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,420
who is amongst other things,
an oral historian by the way at the 

40
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,980
British imperial war museum,
which is every military history,

41
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:47,390
nuts,
dream gig.

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,860
Love to go to work by a couple of giant 
15 inch naval guns.

43
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:53,170
Which one of those,
you know,

44
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:58,171
they have several of these war museums,
but the main one in London has the big 

45
00:02:58,171 --> 00:02:59,940
naval guns outside.
You just take a picture.

46
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,970
Here's where I work,
right?

47
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,170
Eat your heart out.
Anyway,

48
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,580
uh,
one little note.

49
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,760
Normally we have an in house phone 
system we use when we do interviews,

50
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,090
but normally we only use that for North 
American interviews when we're overseas 

51
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,320
calls.
We've been using sort of an internet 

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,301
system and uh,
this time it led us down with some 

53
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:20,851
pretty serious glitches at times,
especially near the end of the 

54
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:20,851
interview.

55
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,550
Not only my apologies to Peter Hart,
but to you also.

56
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,970
Uh,
it's frustrating and there was no way 

57
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,090
for us to fix it.
So I am going to put a couple of,

58
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,150
shall we call them end notes after the 
interview where I both a quote something

59
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:39,280
that we referenced in the show so that 
we include that,

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,810
uh,
explained something.

61
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:44,740
Mr Hart said at the end that the digital
glitches did not make easy to understand

62
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:50,550
and also read a letter that we 
referenced in the story to something 

63
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,100
that Peter Hart,
a uncovered for one of his books that we

64
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:59,101
used in the blueprint for Armageddon 
series and reread that to just show you 

65
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:02,581
the man's ability to demonstrate the 
ripples of pain that something like this

66
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,670
conflict,
you know,

67
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:09,100
created in that era,
in those societies,

68
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:11,380
and drop you right into the middle of it
for a minute.

69
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,360
So without further ado,
uh,

70
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,650
the wonderful author and oral war 
historian,

71
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:20,290
maybe a good way to put it,
the Great Peter Hart.

72
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,170
So the first thing I want to know 
because I'm just curious as a person who

73
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:29,171
is absolutely jealous of anyone who can 
find such a specialty to devote their 

74
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:30,980
lives to,
um,

75
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:36,130
how did it,
for you mostly become because you've 

76
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,530
done other things but mostly become 
something about the first world war.

77
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:41,531
What grabbed your interest about this 
and what is it that keeps you so 

78
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:41,531
interested in the subject?

79
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,540
Well,
I think it started when I was young and 

80
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,750
there was a program called the Great 
Wall,

81
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,210
uh,
which was all Italian,

82
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,240
the 19 sixties,
and it was gloomy and miserable and it 

83
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,011
seems so awful.
People suffered so much and for me it's 

84
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:04,051
always been that dichotomy.
It's a dichotomy between the people who 

85
00:05:04,051 --> 00:05:08,940
suffered and what the generals did and 
why they did that because you may or may

86
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:13,951
not realize I,
I quite support the approach of the 

87
00:05:13,951 --> 00:05:16,831
generals and it,
it's the way that it's an entirely 

88
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:20,371
logical way of behaving,
but it's terrible for those that are 

89
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:23,800
involved and that has always informed or
I hope has informed all the work.

90
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,990
I do it.
It's,

91
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:25,590
it's,
it's,

92
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,220
it's what it's all about for me

93
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,530
now.
You've been doing it long enough so that

94
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:34,531
you've been around to watch sort of how 
public perception over time on these 

95
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:39,811
events has changed.
Because I remember I was born in 1965 

96
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:40,570
and I remember in the United States 
growing up as a kid,

97
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,990
there was a sense about the first world 
war that it was like the Second World 

98
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,490
War,
but a little less in terms of the good 

99
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:50,490
and evil,
still the good and evil.

100
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,630
The Kaiser was evil man,
but not quite to Hitler standards.

101
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,900
And then since I've grown up that good 
evil aspect to first world war has 

102
00:05:58,131 --> 00:05:59,520
seemed to be,
um,

103
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:02,540
to fade over time quite a bit,
at least here in the United States.

104
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:07,541
Have you noticed,
can you comment a little bit on the 

105
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:07,541
differences in the way,
you know,

106
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:08,420
Barbara Tuchman writes a book years ago 
that,

107
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:13,450
that Jack Kennedy reads,
that's really particularly hard on the 

108
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:17,651
Germans.
The stuff I read today has a very 

109
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:19,601
different tone.
What have you noticed in the change of 

110
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:20,480
if we were doing news,
we would say the coverage over the last,

111
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,580
say,
four decades of the first world war.

112
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:23,850
Oh,
I've,

113
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,940
I've noticed a fair amount of coverage.
My perception has always been that in 

114
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:31,130
the end,
if there were batteries,

115
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,530
then it was the Germans,
but that there were a lot of people 

116
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,900
doing things that were difficult or 
wrong,

117
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,480
um,
that there were four or five major m and

118
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:46,470
pause that was struggling together 
trying to establish domination.

119
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,750
A lot of them had agendas that we 
wouldn't particularly recognizes today 

120
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,050
has been a pleasant or,
you know,

121
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,550
uh,
the,

122
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,780
the,
the colonialism,

123
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:56,050
things like that,
uh,

124
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,780
that,
that treatment of the colonies,

125
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:02,010
the way they generally behaved and 
everything.

126
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,950
And for me,
um,

127
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,300
we have now an acceptance that whilst 
the Germans pushed the war,

128
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,520
they were partly did that because they 
were being pushed,

129
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,530
bothered the Russians and the French and
the French who had their own agendas.

130
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,530
And it's just become much more 
complicated.

131
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,880
Uh,
the thing is,

132
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,990
it's not easy,
is it?

133
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,110
You know,
that's the problem with history that 

134
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,280
when you add new orleans,
things stopped being good and evil.

135
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,860
So becoming just much more complex

136
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,200
now.
One of the things you do so 

137
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,200
fantastically,
we try to do it here too.

138
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,290
It's a great if you can pull it off,
it's a great way to do it.

139
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:43,291
You pull it off all the time where 
you're able to take the reader from the 

140
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:47,551
macro,
you know you'll have us in the in the 

141
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,981
board room and you'll have quotes from 
assistance to the great grand 

142
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:54,661
strategists who are deciding how to use 
troops on the battlefield and then all 

143
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:55,930
of a sudden you'll telescope down to 
some poor,

144
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:01,410
a combatant who's injured mortally in 
some shell hole who's writing alas,

145
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:06,810
letter to his wife and kids that he's 
going to strapped to his body to find 

146
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:06,820
later.
First of all,

147
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:09,280
you know,
explain to the listener a little bit how

148
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:14,281
you go about finding these materials.
It would seem to me to be one of the 

149
00:08:14,281 --> 00:08:16,480
luxuries of working in a in a semi 
modern era.

150
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:21,481
I mean the poor Roman historian has much
less in the way of letters from 

151
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:21,550
combatants to go on,
but.

152
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,740
But you're able to mind emotionally mine
this material out there.

153
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,920
How do you find it?
And if it's as powerful as it is on the 

154
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:35,281
sterile text page as I'm reading it,
how much more powerful is it for you 

155
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,590
when you're holding the,
the actual stained letter in your hands?

156
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,240
Well,
I'd say more than my books that I found 

157
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,720
a letter that was from a French soldier.
I used that,

158
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,260
but I am extremely lucky that I have 
been for the last 30,

159
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,000
35 years,
the oral historian at the imperial war.

160
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,320
So I a did all the,
a lot.

161
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:03,321
Not all at all,
but I did a lot of the first row or 

162
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:06,021
interviews with veterans and that 
provided with a fantastic source which 

163
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:07,620
the war museums allowed me to use.
And secondly,

164
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:11,450
I have worked closely with the 
Department of documents there that uh,

165
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,700
and that just opening the dusty old 
folders that they're all cataloged and 

166
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:19,080
preserved by,
by the staff.

167
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:24,140
But you know,
you open these and you no idea what 

168
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,620
you're going to find.
And sometimes it can be utterly tedious.

169
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,620
You know,
Joe's letter after letter or boring you.

170
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:29,130
No,
no,

171
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,160
no.
And then suddenly you get someone 

172
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,160
swimming.

173
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,200
It's really fiscal that,
that tears you apart,

174
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:37,500
that you know it,
you just get letters at that,

175
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,820
you realize these are the last letters.
They,

176
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:45,190
you know,
you've been reading this bloke's life 

177
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,240
and then suddenly they're suddenly,
it's not his letter,

178
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:48,050
it's a letter from his commanding 
officer and you know,

179
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:49,680
it.
It's amazing.

180
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,150
And I just think I'm very lucky to work 
at the war museum from that.

181
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:56,130
I then look through lots of other 
sources.

182
00:09:56,131 --> 00:10:01,131
I go to other museums,
I go to other places and of course I 

183
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:01,530
look at personal experience,
um,

184
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,970
uh,
books,

185
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,480
mainly old ones,
but like I use quite a few modern one 

186
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:08,480
serve,
you know,

187
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,410
or,
or regimental history is often have it 

188
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:13,410
buried inside them.
Personal experience accounts,

189
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,540
you know,
the Americans.

190
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:19,541
I picked up a lot from the Internet 
where the pdfs of the books are 19 

191
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,410
twenties are online and you can consult 
them.

192
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,690
It's fabulous.
And,

193
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,100
and that's where I get the material.
Uh,

194
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:26,910
and uh,
yes,

195
00:10:26,911 --> 00:10:27,810
it,
it can be,

196
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,510
you know,
the,

197
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,550
the actual real letters that I see at 
the museum can be really painful.

198
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:36,440
Obviously humans are humans at Ground 
Zero,

199
00:10:36,441 --> 00:10:41,441
but when you're reading and you focus 
mostly on the British side of the 

200
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:41,441
experience,
but you cover everything,

201
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,540
do you notice any broad,
broad differences in,

202
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:50,350
say you're reading something from ground
zero from a French soldier or some 

203
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:53,000
German soldier on the line versus some 
British or American soldier.

204
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:58,420
Are there any differences in terms of 
the way that their national 

205
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,901
characteristics sort of come through in 
the material or at ground zero when 

206
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:04,130
you're sitting in a trench with 
artillery falling all around you are.

207
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:05,900
We are.
We are broadly the same.

208
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,980
I very much go for broadly the same.
I'm not a great believer in national 

209
00:11:12,411 --> 00:11:17,411
characteristics I need anyway.
It can help sometimes it's a shorthand 

210
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:20,630
to explain certain things,
but if you take it too literally it goes

211
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:22,050
into dark alleys.
Uh,

212
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,640
what,
what,

213
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,430
uh,
I really think though is that underneath

214
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:30,431
human beings when they placed under real
pressure tend to respond in a similar 

215
00:11:31,371 --> 00:11:33,110
sort of way.
And for me,

216
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:35,340
a French soldier that the accounts,
you know,

217
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,700
sometimes I have to translate which can 
be difficult.

218
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:38,280
Um,
gray,

219
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,740
uh,
a friend of Mine,

220
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:44,450
translation to the German ones for me 
because I don't speak or read German.

221
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,060
And fundamentally they're the same.
They have slightly different ways of 

222
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,500
expressing themselves,
but that's just cultural.

223
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,490
But underneath,
when the shelves are falling,

224
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,830
when their friends are killed,
uh,

225
00:11:56,831 --> 00:12:00,160
when they given oldest,
it could lead them to be killed.

226
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,680
There.
The same sort of people.

227
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,080
They are,
uh,

228
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,960
you know,
uh,

229
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,180
they are,
they're just ordinary people.

230
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:12,410
You know,
that's maybe one of the things that at 

231
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,531
least I imagine touches many people once
they start in a reading about the war is

232
00:12:14,871 --> 00:12:16,520
these,
these incidents where,

233
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,570
you know,
the,

234
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,060
the comradeship.
Maybe the German soldiers would say,

235
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:22,490
but we're,
the soldiers have multiple sides who,

236
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,880
you know,
more and more modern history's we'll 

237
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,550
talk about how prisoners would be killed
sometimes and all the horrors of war.

238
00:12:28,551 --> 00:12:30,260
And yet at the same time,
you know,

239
00:12:30,261 --> 00:12:33,710
the notion is when these people end up 
having truces where they,

240
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,860
you know,
share Christmas decorations or play 

241
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:38,860
football,
as you guys would call it soccer,

242
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,700
we would call it or,
or any of the many,

243
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,730
many incidents like that getting stuck 
in a shell hole with someone from the 

244
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,701
other side in your latest book that was 
a primary source quote where a British 

245
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:53,291
soldier had his arm really badly injured
and goes marching to the back with a 

246
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:55,790
bunch of German prisoners who start 
doctoring his wounds.

247
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:02,050
Do you notice,
I mean I don't see as much of that and 

248
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,120
it might be part of the historiography 
or what have you,

249
00:13:02,121 --> 00:13:07,121
part of the myth making.
But when I read stuff in the Second 

250
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:10,360
World War,
I find a lot less of that than in the 

251
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,281
first world war.
Anything in on the front of your mind 

252
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:12,281
that might account for the difference 
there?

253
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:13,940
Or Am I just imagining that there is 
one?

254
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,230
If there is a there,
there was more hatred in the Second 

255
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,440
World War.
I think we all,

256
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,280
it's only our opinions from the things 
we've read and,

257
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,340
but I,
I into,

258
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:32,341
I've interviewed an awful lot of second 
one more second world war soldiers in 

259
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:32,341
the first world war,
so I'll just,

260
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,440
and there is more hatred there,
bit bit because of the nature of the 

261
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,110
regime they're fighting.
Now.

262
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:41,220
The communist regime in Russia was 
pretty rough as well,

263
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,960
but,
but there was a hatred of the Nazis,

264
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,200
but very rarely in any war,
there are not many soldiers that,

265
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,290
that,
that,

266
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,700
that,
that respond,

267
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,820
uh,
with murder and torture.

268
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,540
And the rest of it,
most of them in my experience,

269
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,720
uh,
a main maintain a lid on their emotions.

270
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,310
And,
and,

271
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:02,930
uh,
it's,

272
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:03,850
it's,
it's there,

273
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:07,300
but there are a few who do respond with,
with,

274
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,830
uh,
uh,

275
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,270
well,
just murder,

276
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,630
you know,
or,

277
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,430
or panic.

278
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,790
Often it's panic.
The trick,

279
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:19,900
the trick is the murder.
So the first World War that you've 

280
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,620
mentioned it first up,
comradeship is the thing that binds the 

281
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,260
army's together.
But most of all,

282
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:30,190
it binds.
It binds you to your fellow soldiers.

283
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,090
That's what helps you.
That's what it lets you go over the top.

284
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,280
It's,
it's not a king and country a or 

285
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,790
precedent.
Uh,

286
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,040
it's not,
um,

287
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,900
it's not religion.
What in the end when it all comes down 

288
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,410
to,
it's mostly the bugs.

289
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:48,680
You're with your mates,
the,

290
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,890
the men who went through training with 
who faced death with you,

291
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,680
that that's what helps you get through 
it.

292
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,360
You know,
you mentioned something going over the 

293
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,391
top a minute ago,
such an iconic way of differentiating 

294
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:06,891
the,
at least western front experience of 

295
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:06,891
this war from all the others.
And you know,

296
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:11,081
it occurs to me that because of sort of 
the nature of technology and the way 

297
00:15:11,081 --> 00:15:15,201
things have gone,
I don't think you're ever going to get 

298
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:18,680
the same experience that those first 
world war soldiers went through ever 

299
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:18,870
again.
I mean,

300
00:15:18,871 --> 00:15:23,871
I don't think you're ever gonna have 
hundreds and hundreds or thousands of 

301
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:25,440
guns peppering a small space of 
territory anymore.

302
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:27,330
You don't need to because of the 
accuracy.

303
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,760
You're never going to mix them with gas 
the way you did.

304
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:34,761
I mean,
if you think as I do that that would 

305
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:37,371
have been equal to the worst place a 
soldier could have ever been right in 

306
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:39,630
front of the line about to go over the 
top western front.

307
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:42,570
I don't think you're ever going to get 
that experience again.

308
00:15:42,571 --> 00:15:44,010
You're never going to have human beings 
watch.

309
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,570
Uh,
I think I forgot the.

310
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:50,571
I'm the author who had said one of the 
soldiers described watching a forest 

311
00:15:50,571 --> 00:15:52,410
disappear in front of his eyes due to 
artillery.

312
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,620
I mean,
that's a human experience that I don't 

313
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,530
think any human being's going to ever 
see again in the beginning of the second

314
00:15:58,531 --> 00:16:00,330
world war Churchill's history of the 
war.

315
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:05,510
He talked about what was in store in 19,
19 if the war hadn't ended in 1918.

316
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,250
The various,
you know,

317
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:12,150
horrible concoctions that the allies had
put together your latest book.

318
00:16:12,151 --> 00:16:15,900
The last battle is from that era.
Can you talk a little bit about what 19,

319
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:17,610
19 on the front might have looked like?

320
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,380
Uh,
uh,

321
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,180
the British had a,
the,

322
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,370
the,
the Germans had that blue cross gas.

323
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:27,360
It didn't work properly.
I mixture of a punishes gas and the sort

324
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,690
of particles,
the particles made you vomit,

325
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:33,520
so he had to take your gas mask off and 
then they got,

326
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,650
you know,
the poisonous gas.

327
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:39,651
Got You.
Now the German version didn't work 

328
00:16:39,651 --> 00:16:42,291
properly,
but the British had worked out on their 

329
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:44,631
allies by the way.
I'd worked out how to do it and I fully 

330
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:46,690
intended to poison most of the German 
army in 19,

331
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,520
19.
Uh,

332
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,310
it,
it is a vicious war.

333
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,130
Uh,
and,

334
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,890
and the practices in a way that was just
one step forward,

335
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,700
you know,
the,

336
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,200
the um,
because we've sort of moved on.

337
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:03,230
Then it was mass barrages.
Now there's no need for mass priorities 

338
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,191
now.
And although we did revert to it after 

339
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:07,191
El Alamein for instance as well,
and they have them on the,

340
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:10,350
in 1944 on the west,
only in Europe,

341
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,470
but it's replaced by mass bombing isn't 
it?

342
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:18,650
And then of course it's a nuclear method
and then its accuracy and so technology 

343
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:23,601
moves on and.
But like the killing can still be on a 

344
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:23,640
mass scale.
For instance,

345
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:27,090
in the Iraq war,
there was mass killing the Gulf war,

346
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:31,710
mass killing of a,
an it needs to be remembered.

347
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,850
What happens is the masculine tends not 
to be on our side anymore.

348
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,490
Um,
you know,

349
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,020
uh,
so that,

350
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,750
that pretty well how I feel about it.

351
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,740
Well,
it is interesting too,

352
00:17:44,741 --> 00:17:49,741
because when we were talking about the 
first world war in the series that we 

353
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:49,741
did on it,
you know,

354
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:49,741
you,
you,

355
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:54,770
you almost want to overwhelm the 
listener with both the casualty 

356
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,500
statistics and then the,
the amount of mean,

357
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,660
the sheer numbers of things like shells.
I mean the numbers overwhelm you.

358
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:01,590
I'm,
you know,

359
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,960
a lot of Americans,
for example,

360
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:08,961
they like to tell jokes about the French
and surrendering in the Second World 

361
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:09,330
War.
And so you would like to point out,

362
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,170
Hey,
wait a minute,

363
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,350
you know,
when did our side ever take 27,000

364
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,680
dead in a single day?
You know,

365
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,510
those kind of numbers are so 
overwhelming that in the United States,

366
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:23,511
you know,
there's not a lot of memorials to the 

367
00:18:23,511 --> 00:18:25,221
first world war and all this.
But you go to Europe and they are 

368
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:25,221
everywhere.
Um,

369
00:18:25,221 --> 00:18:27,000
can you talk a little bit about sort of 
the lasting effect?

370
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:27,850
I mean,
the,

371
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,860
the,
the feeling of connection to the first 

372
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:32,860
world war never died down in Europe.
Did it

373
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:33,790
not really?
Well,

374
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:37,610
for the French and Germans,
it was monstrously painful business.

375
00:18:37,611 --> 00:18:40,030
I mean,
they are much hotter than the British.

376
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,130
The French in particular,
you'll right.

377
00:18:42,131 --> 00:18:43,520
That's all nate.
Uh,

378
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,150
I'd say August 19,
14,

379
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:50,020
the French lost 27,000
dead in a single day.

380
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,570
Now the British,
when John about suffering,

381
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,220
I think a 600 that uh,
uh,

382
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,930
uh,
uh,

383
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,950
it's a different scale and the French 
sector and the French then fault almost 

384
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,481
on their own for two or three years.
People say the Americans took a long 

385
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:07,180
time to get into the wall,
you know,

386
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:10,030
from a April 19,
17 to a,

387
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,460
to well properly June,
July 19,

388
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:14,170
18,
17 years.

389
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,840
Not 17 to 19 eight,
so bit over a year.

390
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,770
But the British took from August 1914 to
the somme,

391
00:19:20,771 --> 00:19:23,320
July on the somme before we were 
properly involved.

392
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:24,490
Uh,
you know,

393
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,790
that people often forget when they're 
throwing stones at other countries,

394
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,560
they forget,
like we sometimes do it,

395
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:32,800
the Americans or the Americans or the 
French or British or the French.

396
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:38,340
When you look at your own decide we 
often have the same sort of problems or 

397
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:38,870
the same,
uh,

398
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,120
false.
Um,

399
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,970
and I find that it's one of those 
interesting things.

400
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,620
Um,
the American losses were dreadful in the

401
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,830
first world war that they suffered a 
very high rate of losses from when they 

402
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:55,780
fully joined the battle of the battle.
Uh,

403
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,960
uh,
in the,

404
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,210
uh,
the are gone,

405
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,730
the [inaudible] gone region is 
murderous.

406
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:05,970
It's as murderous as any of the battle 
in the first world war and considering 

407
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,470
that they only really for full pelt for 
three months,

408
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,050
the American casualties are worth 
remembering.

409
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:16,530
But,
but for one reason or another possibly 

410
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:16,790
could say disengaged from Europe a bit 
in,

411
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,460
in the,
in the interwar years,

412
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,840
the Americans have never really 
remembered it in the same way as we do.

413
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:28,510
Yes.
I always try to imagine if the US had 

414
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:28,850
fought for two years at those kinds of 
casualty rates.

415
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:29,990
Um,
yeah,

416
00:20:29,991 --> 00:20:32,180
we'd have a few more war memorials 
around here.

417
00:20:32,181 --> 00:20:33,380
Certainly would,
you know,

418
00:20:33,381 --> 00:20:34,580
I think about,
um,

419
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,540
contexts,
you know,

420
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:39,200
if history teaches anything,
it helps us understand how things get to

421
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:41,990
where they are and in this country,
once again,

422
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:46,991
you know,
they'll try to use in political 

423
00:20:46,991 --> 00:20:46,991
discussions the lessons of history,
right?

424
00:20:46,991 --> 00:20:51,281
We know from the 19,
38 appeasement stuff that you can't do 

425
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:51,281
this or that or the other thing,
you know,

426
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:53,230
the classic misuse of the lessons of 
history,

427
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,560
but I always try to,
and I'm going to ask you for your 

428
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:58,560
opinion on this because you've read a 
lot of stuff.

429
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,700
The generation that gets accused of 
really doing anything they could to 

430
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,291
avoid another world war are the ones 
that lived through it as younger people.

431
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,660
How did that scar?
The leadership on both sides really in 

432
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,251
the second world war as they sort of 
maneuvered jockeyed a threatened try to 

433
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:22,710
avoid via compromise a repetition of the
worst thing any of them had ever lived 

434
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:23,680
through.

435
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,680
I think there's some truth in that I'm 
not an expert,

436
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:33,570
but certainly that there was peace 
movements in Britain and France for the 

437
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:37,240
French pretty broken by their awful 
experiences,

438
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:40,570
you know,
[inaudible] is the one that gets most of

439
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,600
the blame for what happened,
but he was responding to a popular 

440
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,190
element within the country.
I see that they just were not willing to

441
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:49,420
suffer it all.
Again,

442
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,950
I'll have so much sympathy for them.
Uh,

443
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:58,030
the Germans of course also that you just
have less sympathy for them.

444
00:21:58,031 --> 00:21:59,250
So,
um,

445
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,940
the,
the British,

446
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
you know,
it took a while for us to get properly 

447
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,000
into the wall.
I mean,

448
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,670
even in the second we'll,
we'll,

449
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:07,450
uh,
the,

450
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,400
the phony war and then you know,
that people were trying to get that.

451
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:16,870
There was an appeasement movement in 
Britain right until Churchill took over.

452
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:22,290
And Churchill,
for all his faults was the walnut 

453
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:25,300
finally pinned the British into,
into a post in Nazi Germany in the long 

454
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:31,401
term because they were elements in 
British society that we're perfectly 

455
00:22:31,401 --> 00:22:32,880
happy to do a deal with it.
Um,

456
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:33,950
it,
it,

457
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,670
you know,
it's a complex period,

458
00:22:36,671 --> 00:22:39,970
which I am not an expert on at all.
Your latest

459
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,230
we'll call the last battle focuses on,
you know,

460
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:48,231
from a military history standpoint,
I think one of the most fascinating 

461
00:22:48,231 --> 00:22:51,920
periods in the first world war,
but it seems to get lost in the burdens 

462
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,160
and the psalms and the passion Dales and
all that.

463
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:58,470
Talk a little bit about that era where 
we go away from the iconic western front

464
00:22:58,471 --> 00:22:58,830
of,
of,

465
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:04,040
of a stalemate on the front to open 
movement again and something that looks 

466
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,580
like a prototype for 1939 warfare.

467
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,970
It,
it certainly is.

468
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,610
Um,
I mean,

469
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,740
everything changes with the,
the itch the allies come up with the 

470
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,770
alarms battle,
which is basically finding all the 

471
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:21,770
different weapons,
the artillery,

472
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,740
the gas,
the mass machine gun fire that tanks,

473
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,560
the aeroplanes,
that light machine guns,

474
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,080
mortars,
everything together,

475
00:23:30,081 --> 00:23:32,300
working together with,
uh,

476
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:32,710
to,
to,

477
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:33,380
to,
to,

478
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,920
to overwhelm anything that Germans do,
took a breakthrough.

479
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,910
But also it's the difference that not 
just attacking on one place,

480
00:23:40,911 --> 00:23:44,030
like at the summer pasture,
but to attack for attacks,

481
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:47,150
for battles for days.
He Americans go first,

482
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,320
that then,
then the British and the Canadians then 

483
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,320
and then uh,
the French,

484
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,860
the Belgians and the British,
and then finally the British again,

485
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:59,861
and the French full battles for day is 
pushing the Germans.

486
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:05,350
Now,
the reason it's missed out and normally 

487
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:05,350
book's finished roundabout the eighth of
August.

488
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,860
My own book on 1918,
a very British victory,

489
00:24:06,861 --> 00:24:08,030
which was a bit of a job title.

490
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,840
I have to admit,
I don't know why I did that.

491
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:16,250
I have got a sense of humor which does 
come out at a parcel really normally.

492
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:20,120
And the point was that you sort of,
you publish it.

493
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,220
If they say right,
we've had enough of them go to the top.

494
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:25,070
Now we've had.
And that's what you tend to miss out.

495
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,880
Even that book by me,
you know,

496
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:32,000
Mrs the last six weeks of the war.
And I wanted to put that right with this

497
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:34,580
because there are so many enormous 
battles.

498
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,970
Open warfare comes in.
Open warfare is worse.

499
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:42,971
The casualty figures get higher,
much higher because because you're in 

500
00:24:42,971 --> 00:24:44,720
the open,
if something goes wrong,

501
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,500
you know,
hey,

502
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:49,970
God is the British to go forward,
push through in a very modern fashion,

503
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
push through,
ignore isolated pockets of resistance 

504
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,360
there'll be dealt with,
but if you're an infantry soldier and 

505
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:58,430
you go past an isolated pocket of 
resistance,

506
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:03,610
you'll get killed and the inmates will 
as well because they'll fire into your 

507
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:03,610
flanks.

508
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:06,320
Does she go by?
So it's efficient militarily,

509
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:11,321
but it leads to huge casualties.
It's a painful time for the British and 

510
00:25:11,321 --> 00:25:15,080
the Americans who are learning at the 
same time and anyone,

511
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,720
anyone who has insults,
the American,

512
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:22,750
the courage of the American troops on a,
in the Argon,

513
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,690
those battles is mad because if you 
insult them,

514
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,440
you're insulting the British on the 
Somme and you're insulting the French in

515
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:35,441
1914,
you're insulting basically armies that 

516
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:35,510
don't know what's going to happen to 
them.

517
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:40,511
They haven't had a chance to learn and 
that I think you don't learn this until 

518
00:25:40,511 --> 00:25:44,681
you get right into the end of the war 
because the Americans don't really get 

519
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:45,060
into the war until,
uh,

520
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,840
until September about September the 
26th.

521
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:53,140
That's when their wall really starts 
when they attack the Argonne forest 

522
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:55,430
water place.
You know,

523
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,560
I've been there.
It's murder,

524
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:03,210
you know,
you mentioned earlier and you just sort 

525
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:03,210
of opened the door to it again.

526
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,370
I'm one of the,
one of the aspects,

527
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:09,371
one of the opinions,
one of the points of views on this 

528
00:26:09,371 --> 00:26:09,371
subject that you're kind of known for,
you know,

529
00:26:09,371 --> 00:26:13,771
I,
I'd put you and I guess you would put 

530
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:13,771
yourself in the camp of those who look 
at,

531
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:14,660
for example,
the performance of the generals,

532
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:19,010
which of course famously some compared 
to butchery to.

533
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,520
If I could,
I could sum it up maybe A.

534
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,840
I'm doing pretty well considering what a
natural learning curve on,

535
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,900
on,
on a big technological revolution in 

536
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,300
military affairs like this one might be 
a.

537
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,940
is that fair to say that you think that 
they've done a pretty good job?

538
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:39,970
All things considered spot on,
particularly some of the more advanced 

539
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,900
French and British general and uh,
I,

540
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,680
I stand by,
Hey,

541
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:48,780
I,
I know it makes me a puppet or in some 

542
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,171
places.
The thing about Haig was he was don't 

543
00:26:51,171 --> 00:26:54,141
think of him as a general thinking of 
him as a chief executive of a massive 

544
00:26:54,141 --> 00:26:54,141
American Corporation.

545
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,640
Someone who,
who provides direction,

546
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,200
someone who brings things together.
So who enables or makes things happen.

547
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:04,950
If you think of him that way,
you get in a much better idea of what he

548
00:27:04,951 --> 00:27:09,951
was.
He was a commander in chief of five 

549
00:27:09,951 --> 00:27:10,390
armies.
There is no such thing as in,

550
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,100
uh,
in the,

551
00:27:11,101 --> 00:27:12,270
uh,
Second World War.

552
00:27:12,271 --> 00:27:13,840
I mean,
you know each.

553
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,630
I mean,
there people are supreme commanders,

554
00:27:15,631 --> 00:27:20,631
but they had people to deal with.
Politicians have to deal with our 

555
00:27:20,631 --> 00:27:23,331
allies.
That doesn't happen in the first world 

556
00:27:23,331 --> 00:27:23,331
war.
It's just,

557
00:27:23,331 --> 00:27:25,600
hey,
who has to deal with all of them and it,

558
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,740
that's how it works.
And they did come up and.

559
00:27:28,741 --> 00:27:30,480
But when it's not,
Haig comes up with it,

560
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:35,160
but it enables the system which allows 
the all arms battle to function.

561
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,400
And can I just want,
it's not a learning curve,

562
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:44,010
what it is is too big,
deepest side by side and once the allies

563
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:49,011
or the British,
if you were to look at it narrowly 

564
00:27:49,011 --> 00:27:50,780
British or Americans and then the other 
side is the Germans and for every new 

565
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,020
attacking method you bring in the 
Germans bringing a defensive attitude.

566
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:59,300
It's not a curve.
You go up and you go down and something 

567
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,751
that works on Tuesday,
it might not work next Thursday because 

568
00:28:02,751 --> 00:28:02,970
the Germans will have changed their 
tactics.

569
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:06,360
That's an analogy.
Not An exact timeframe obviously,

570
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,730
but what I mean is it's constantly 
changing.

571
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,830
So in 1951 trench line,
perhaps one and a half.

572
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,800
Then later in that year there's three 
trench lines.

573
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,040
By the year afterwards,
there's three trench systems and then 

574
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,130
readouts.
Soon after that you start to get the 

575
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:27,450
pill is the underground block houses 
where the troops can be kept safe.

576
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,380
You get different machine can tactics.
So the Germans are constantly changing.

577
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:34,320
Now we changed as well.
British bringing tanks,

578
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,210
are they great?
Not First,

579
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:39,150
but they're part of it that were 
different tactics,

580
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,050
different infantry tactics.
So both sides are changing,

581
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,060
enhance.
If you think of two big diapers,

582
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:46,980
I think you call them something else in 
America,

583
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:49,430
but you know a little right,
well,

584
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,440
lots going up and down hills at running 
side by side and you find out who's 

585
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,960
going to win a battle by where you are 
in relation to the other side.

586
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,980
Henson,
the Psalm,

587
00:28:59,010 --> 00:28:59,850
first,
Psalm,

588
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,280
first day of the somme,
19th,

589
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:05,970
six days were very low down there.
They've got great trench systems,

590
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,430
great weapons of defense.
And we,

591
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:08,960
we're,
we're,

592
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,070
we're,
we're an,

593
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,250
we don't know what we're doing,
but all told by the end of the war,

594
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:19,490
we really have learned to where the very
high end we're looking down on the 

595
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,890
Germans.
But it is a complex system that,

596
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,860
that the,
uh,

597
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,500
I think,
uh,

598
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,630
Golden Corrigan,
a British historian once said,

599
00:29:24,631 --> 00:29:29,340
it wasn't the generals killed up boys.
It was the Germans and it's the same for

600
00:29:29,341 --> 00:29:32,340
your American lads.
It's the Germans that did it.

601
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:37,790
And when we try and blame just our 
generals or just our senior offices or 

602
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:42,330
blame our allies,
you're not understanding what's 

603
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:44,901
happening.
We're fighting a very complex war 

604
00:29:44,901 --> 00:29:47,350
against the best army in the world,
one of the biggest army in the world.

605
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,550
The Germans

606
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,980
you wrote in your book that modern 
warfare was just so damn complicated at 

607
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,470
every level.
Um,

608
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,980
so let's talk about that for a minute 
because it seems to me and I,

609
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,030
you know,
obviously there were,

610
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:02,030
there were earlier wars were,
these changes happened,

611
00:30:02,031 --> 00:30:04,610
but so slowly that they may not have 
been important.

612
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,530
It seems to me that the first world 
wars,

613
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:11,060
the first one where we get that very 
modern sort of sense where technology is

614
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:16,061
changing so quickly that it's not that 
you're going to have to learn the 

615
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:17,240
lessons of this war and adapt for the 
next war.

616
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:20,900
You're going to have to learn the 
lessons of today's air combat,

617
00:30:20,901 --> 00:30:25,901
for example,
so that in six months you have the 

618
00:30:25,901 --> 00:30:27,350
newest discovery or the other side's 
gonna shoot your people out of the air.

619
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,390
Now,
in the Second World War you saw this,

620
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:31,580
this,
this dynamic going on all the time.

621
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:36,581
What's the latest tank?
What's the latest version of the 

622
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:36,581
airplane?
But in the first world war,

623
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:37,100
it seems like that's the first time 
that,

624
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,570
that needing to learn on the fly and 
adapt during the conflict becomes,

625
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,630
well a war winning or a war losing 
potentially thing.

626
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,070
Absolutely.
And it's so quick.

627
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:53,340
I mean,
the aircraft that took place before the 

628
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,161
battle of the somme,
the aircraft that took control of the 

629
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:59,341
air over the song were British and that 
there were things like the Idh to the 

630
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:00,690
uh,
uh,

631
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,390
you know,
the,

632
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:01,900
um,
uh,

633
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:05,350
the fee to be that the sopwith strutter 
by God,

634
00:31:05,351 --> 00:31:10,270
there were names to conjure with them 
camels 17.

635
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,490
That's later.
But they took control.

636
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:17,590
They will outclass totally by the 
Albatross just three months later,

637
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:22,690
three months now.
People like me still think that the,

638
00:31:22,691 --> 00:31:23,110
uh,
you know,

639
00:31:23,111 --> 00:31:25,120
the whole carrier,
a decent aircraft,

640
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:29,050
that's 19 fifties technology that flew 
in the sixties,

641
00:31:29,051 --> 00:31:31,440
seventies and eighties and has been 
outdated now.

642
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,470
Best part of 10 years.
Then it was months,

643
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,440
just months.
And you could be flying an aircraft that

644
00:31:38,441 --> 00:31:40,570
was great.
And now he's useless.

645
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,720
In fact,
it's a death trap when you meet 

646
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:45,720
something better.

647
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:45,820
And,
and I find,

648
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:50,590
and I think that there is a warfare as a
catalyst for change,

649
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:55,830
you get generals or people like generals
who defined the need and then you get to

650
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,070
a scientist who,
who do the thinking,

651
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:03,700
who work out the theory of how to meet 
that need and then you have a,

652
00:32:03,701 --> 00:32:08,701
you know,
you have the practical men that they're 

653
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:10,300
engineers are practical soldiers and 
they work at it to actually do it,

654
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,850
you know,
how to fix that camera to an airplane,

655
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,930
you know,
how to,

656
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,330
you know,
somebody else works at the focal lengths

657
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:19,450
and everything else,
but someone has to work it out.

658
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,600
You get the theory of a synchronization 
machine so you can shoot through the 

659
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,990
propeller or not through the propeller 
if you see what I mean,

660
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:31,330
that the theories very well and good,
but you need practical mentor,

661
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:36,510
make it work.
And warfare drives along technological 

662
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:37,750
change.
A bit like in the sixties,

663
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,830
um,
if I might,

664
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,710
although it's not my subject a bit like 
the space race did the same,

665
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:48,340
you know,
driving along technological change 

666
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:48,350
because someone's defined a very real 
need.

667
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,880
Well,
and then to bow tie this with what we 

668
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,340
just talked about and then somebody from
the military hierarchy has to figure out

669
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:58,180
how it all fits together operationally.
And if you're the CEO,

670
00:32:58,181 --> 00:33:00,550
like you said,
in a guy like Douglas Haig,

671
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,820
you have to remember that it's a guy who
has to factor in all this,

672
00:33:03,821 --> 00:33:06,280
what we would call today,
high tech stuff.

673
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,910
Who was a cavalry officer born in the 
mid 19th century.

674
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,520
Yep.
He was a buddy.

675
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:15,690
He was known as he educated soldier.
He was saying,

676
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:16,800
I mean,
you read,

677
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,370
you can find a quote for everything if 
you look through the thing,

678
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:20,200
so you'll find,
you know,

679
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:25,200
but he was an enthusiast for machine 
guns eight to has a problem,

680
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,360
a problem.
He's often too keen on new weapons,

681
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,440
uh,
you know,

682
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:30,160
he,
um,

683
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,180
he,
uh,

684
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,470
he,
he doesn't realize that.

685
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,600
Well,
not that he doesn't realize,

686
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:36,690
but sometimes he doesn't appreciate 
that,

687
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,680
that,
that you have to bed them in.

688
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:43,890
There's no point building 300 tanks and 
sending them forward if you don't know 

689
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,680
how to drive them.
Which we didn't in 1968.

690
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,410
It's only 1917.
We knew how they worked,

691
00:33:47,411 --> 00:33:48,730
how the,
how to use them in action,

692
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,160
how to fit them in,
into the all arms battle,

693
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,990
the what's going on is very,
like,

694
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:57,970
I may be a British term or it may be an 
American term that we used,

695
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,700
but hey,
you could not have recognized this term,

696
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,010
but best practice,
you know what I mean?

697
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:06,630
Uh,
all the time the British army is engaged

698
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,160
in something called best practice.
They wouldn't know what that meant,

699
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,810
but they,
they look at a battle,

700
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,300
what worked,
what didn't best practice.

701
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:18,330
They then disseminate in a series of 
pamphlets called the SS unfortunately 

702
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,880
with our perspective,
but ss pamphlets,

703
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,070
a those pamphlets,
how to do this,

704
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:27,640
how to use a tank in battle,
how to use a louis machine guns,

705
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:30,130
how to make an attack,
how to do this,

706
00:34:30,131 --> 00:34:31,900
how to do that.
And this,

707
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,570
this is just,
you know,

708
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:38,620
this is just the stuff of modern warfare
and it takes staff officers.

709
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,660
It takes generals and it takes someone 
like,

710
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,740
Hey,
get the top,

711
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:42,520
uh,
to,

712
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,940
to,
to co ordinate.

713
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,440
He's not a genius.
He's not the Polian.

714
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:51,830
It's probably not even Wellington,
but what he is is a driven individual 

715
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:51,830
who,
who,

716
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:55,480
whose mind for one reason is it's a 
perfect staff officer mind,

717
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:00,690
a combination of detail Dr and the,
the guts to set a direction,

718
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,320
a direction which is painful to many of 
the men who served for it.

719
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,840
When you're reading the histories too,
I mean,

720
00:35:07,841 --> 00:35:12,841
it's so funny because,
and you'll churchill is a perfect 

721
00:35:12,841 --> 00:35:15,241
example of someone who will push this,
but you mentioned it with Hashtag to 

722
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:18,001
where you can see that the best way to 
use this new technology is to sort of 

723
00:35:18,001 --> 00:35:21,190
surprise the other side with it and 
benefit from the shock value.

724
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,790
But as you just pointed out,
the problem is,

725
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:26,890
is that you don't know how to use it 
until you've used it a few times.

726
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:31,891
And then by then of course the Germans 
have started responding with 

727
00:35:31,891 --> 00:35:31,891
countermeasures and whatnot.
I mean,

728
00:35:31,891 --> 00:35:32,800
remember,
uh,

729
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:37,830
was it churchill talked about using the 
tanks when they first appeared in pin 

730
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:41,550
pricks as opposed to some giant battle 
where a thousand of them overwhelmed the

731
00:35:41,551 --> 00:35:42,780
front.
But as you pointed out,

732
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,990
if that was the first time you ever 
really employed them,

733
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,580
would it have been effective at all?

734
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:51,070
That I'd like to take?
Yes.

735
00:35:51,071 --> 00:35:55,300
That's a great exam because the 15th of 
September is the first tank attack.

736
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,080
A three quarters of them broke.
I'm rubbish at statistics.

737
00:35:59,081 --> 00:36:00,140
I'm not that kind of historic,

738
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:06,050
but let's just take the broad brush.
Three quarters or two thirds of them 

739
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,020
broke down and never got to the front.
They'd left gaps in the barrage,

740
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:13,390
the creeping barrage which run forward 
in front of the infantry for the tanks 

741
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:17,400
when they weren't there,
the infantry didn't have any artillery 

742
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:17,410
support.
And in front of them they got lost.

743
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:22,590
They had at the wheels because I thought
they needed wheels at the back to steer 

744
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:27,070
them.
They had no idea how to communicate 

745
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:27,250
between themselves and the infantry when
they go into action.

746
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,280
To be absolutely honest,
there are several,

747
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:35,520
several historians,
a cynical historically think the tanks 

748
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,550
probably killed more British troops in 
German troops that day.

749
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:37,840
Now that is more,
uh,

750
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,590
uh,
uh,

751
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,090
what we call an outlier.
You know,

752
00:36:40,091 --> 00:36:41,770
it's more just a point,
robin,

753
00:36:41,771 --> 00:36:44,890
the serious remark,
but the point,

754
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:53,170
what do you have the slightest how to 
use the tanks inaction and we didn't 

755
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,190
have until home bright now,
which is,

756
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,280
which is a 1978 in 1970 a year and a 
couple of months later,

757
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:08,360
if we'd sent a thousand tanks as they 
were on the 15th to September 1916 over 

758
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,150
the top,
it would have been.

759
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,610
Sorry.

760
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,360
No,
that's,

761
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:18,510
that's okay.
And we're getting some glitches on this 

762
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:18,510
end,
which is not wonderful.

763
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:18,510
Um,
so talk to me,

764
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,630
talk to me a little bit if you could,
about the,

765
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,660
the difference that for years has made 
by the time this book that you put out 

766
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,870
now.
The last battle is focusing on this.

767
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:31,820
The governments of all these countries 
are fundamentally transformed.

768
00:37:31,821 --> 00:37:33,590
I mean Russia,
imperial,

769
00:37:33,591 --> 00:37:36,050
Russia has gone by this time,
Austria,

770
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:39,890
Hungary is shattered and looking for a 
way out of the war behind the scenes.

771
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:45,280
You know,
France has endured some serious troop 

772
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,430
morale problems in the not too distant 
past.

773
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,880
And you know,
that's traditionally like the finest 

774
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,970
army in the world and Britain has gone 
from the greatest creditor nation to one

775
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:55,280
that is transferring their debt to New 
York.

776
00:37:55,281 --> 00:37:57,380
Now.
What's the difference between the armies

777
00:37:57,381 --> 00:38:02,381
of 1914 in the governments that support 
them versus these armies of early 1918 

778
00:38:02,751 --> 00:38:05,240
and the governments that support and 
direct them?

779
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,550
Well,
the non toll tina armies would have been

780
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:12,640
recognizable by Napoleon.
The tactics,

781
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,760
the way that we used would have been 
recognizable from Napoleon from 100 

782
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,051
years before they've got modern weapons,
but they had no idea how to use the 

783
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:24,130
governments were old fashioned 
governments.

784
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:29,230
I mean I know Britain best but so I'll 
use him as an example.

785
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:33,550
Lloyd George is Berry Berry.
Different prep from,

786
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:37,750
from asquith.
The who led the government asked with is

787
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:43,500
not particularly competencies.
Apply Towel gentlemen drinks far too 

788
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:43,620
much.
Squiffy asquith.

789
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:45,970
Lloyd George has many,
many faults.

790
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:50,971
In fact,
I need a few more men to really 

791
00:38:50,971 --> 00:38:53,071
encompasses many faults,
but he is driven and you don't have to 

792
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:56,170
hate Lloyd George just because you like,
hey,

793
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:00,520
they would chalk and cheese,
but they both did their bit.

794
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:05,470
Lloyd George was a classic wall leader.
He provided civilian direction.

795
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:08,860
His idea of what to do with soldiers was
madness and he.

796
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,580
He did not help the direction of the war
on a strategic level,

797
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,000
but on a sort of global level.
He provided the drive,

798
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,590
but Britain was running out of money.
It was running out of resources.

799
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,080
It was running out of troops and and,
and,

800
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:28,100
and it was running out of time.
The war had to be finished in 18 and 

801
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:32,311
that's one thing that hey,
realized he was desperate to have 

802
00:39:32,311 --> 00:39:35,191
finished the war,
not to give the Germans and no other 

803
00:39:35,191 --> 00:39:36,490
chance to provide,
to dig another set of trench lines,

804
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,530
shortened perhaps say from

805
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:43,960
because that's what they really hate and
fear that they have to get them.

806
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,170
The war finished.

807
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:47,060
Frank,

808
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:53,830
you had a revolution.
We know that wasn't a revolution in 

809
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,060
France.
We know there wasn't one in Britain,

810
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,030
but they could have been and people were
very aware of that.

811
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:04,630
Um,
those governments that would have made 

812
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:07,100
it into 1919 if the war we're continuing
might've had problems on the allied side

813
00:40:07,101 --> 00:40:08,000
too.
Not just the,

814
00:40:08,001 --> 00:40:08,550
um,
the,

815
00:40:08,551 --> 00:40:09,590
the central powers.

816
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:12,720
Oh,
absolutely.

817
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:13,920
Uh,
uh,

818
00:40:13,921 --> 00:40:16,560
wall weariness.
I mean it's just,

819
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:18,270
you know,
it was an incredible,

820
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,530
uh,
there was no money that now men,

821
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,460
uh,
everything's depressed.

822
00:40:24,461 --> 00:40:25,010
It,
it's,

823
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,360
it's just,
you know,

824
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,390
an awful thing to be involved in.
Um,

825
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:34,510
countries are struggling and we needed 
Lloyd George to provide the leadership 

826
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:37,090
at the center and,
and the determination to fight on,

827
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:41,180
to make sure that the would be beaten.
I mean,

828
00:40:41,181 --> 00:40:43,620
it's so easy just to give up,
uh,

829
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,660
to just say,
well,

830
00:40:44,661 --> 00:40:49,661
we'll come to some compromise,
but the leaders like Lloyd George would 

831
00:40:49,661 --> 00:40:49,790
not accept that.

832
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,850
I think that's everything.
I mean,

833
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:58,851
did I,
is there something about the new book 

834
00:40:58,851 --> 00:40:59,280
that I didn't ask you about that,
that is worth pointing out?

835
00:40:59,281 --> 00:40:59,670
I mean,
I,

836
00:40:59,671 --> 00:41:02,010
I'm with you.
I find it not just fascinating,

837
00:41:02,011 --> 00:41:05,640
but it's a little like discovering that 
a band and you thought you'd heard every

838
00:41:05,641 --> 00:41:10,641
song from them had a whole bunch of 
songs you didn't know about and they're 

839
00:41:10,641 --> 00:41:13,910
bigger and more interesting than you 
ever knew other than not being able to 

840
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,030
pronounce all of the battlefields and 
the wonderful.

841
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,950
Isn't that wonderful?
Last push in France.

842
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:19,960
What about that last book have we not 
talked about that you think is.

843
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,540
It is especially compelling.

844
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:27,380
I'll tell you what the thing for me is 
it's an emotional response,

845
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,010
which I think you'll appreciate this.
Just A.

846
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,890
It's the essence of the book.
If you've been fighting for years,

847
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:38,891
say you're a soldier in those trenches 
you've been fighting for for years and 

848
00:41:38,891 --> 00:41:40,670
just as start to think it's coming to an
end,

849
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:44,660
it's come into them and then you.
You have to go forward.

850
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,470
You have to go into the attack and not 
everybody do.

851
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,950
You recognize her Second World War.
It's called shell hole.

852
00:41:51,951 --> 00:41:54,230
Drop it.
You can't all drop out.

853
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:58,370
You know you can't all fall back.
Keep keep behind.

854
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:03,850
You just have to keep going with your 
mates and the temptation to shirk in 

855
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:07,250
those final attacks in the final days 
must have been enormous,

856
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:12,200
but somehow most found from somewhere,
the inner resolve which,

857
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:17,290
which people are made just can't really 
grasp or understand because it's beyond 

858
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:18,320
our experience to finish the job.

859
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,920
Generally.
It was the worst of all for that.

860
00:42:21,921 --> 00:42:24,140
And I'm not just saying this because 
you're American.

861
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:30,070
First of all,
as pershing forced the final attack on 

862
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:30,110
the,
the,

863
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,490
the night of the 10th,
11th,

864
00:42:31,491 --> 00:42:35,340
and even the morning of the 11th and,
and you know,

865
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,790
the Americans had nearly 3000 
casualties.

866
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:42,791
I'm rubbish on that final 24 hours and 
just imagine what was going through 

867
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:48,821
their heads when they were told.
I mean the Marines who were told they 

868
00:42:48,821 --> 00:42:50,570
had to cross the mers in a lead foot 
wide river,

869
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:54,050
which Germans with machine guns on the 
other side and just,

870
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:59,140
I mean,
what went through their head and that's 

871
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,621
the last thing I'd like to say about 
just just put yourself there and think 

872
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:06,281
about it.
That's why I liked your book so much 

873
00:43:06,281 --> 00:43:07,640
because you do such a great job of 
giving me the chance to do that.

874
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:12,820
Listen,
we'll try to sell you a few books this 

875
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,621
time.
I hope you'll come on the next time you 

876
00:43:14,621 --> 00:43:14,621
have one and I hope you'll write a bunch
more.

877
00:43:14,621 --> 00:43:14,780
Thank you very much.
I'd love to.

878
00:43:14,781 --> 00:43:16,460
I've really enjoyed it.
Thank you very.

879
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:17,570
Had a great time with,
like I said,

880
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:18,710
meeting heroes.
Take care.

881
00:43:18,711 --> 00:43:20,770
And thank you so much.
Que Ca.

882
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,130
So again,
my apologies for the,

883
00:43:23,131 --> 00:43:24,510
uh,
digital glitches there.

884
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:29,570
Uh,
I will try to figure out a better 

885
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:29,570
method.
I do want to encourage you,

886
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:31,920
if you are a fan or interested in the 
first world war to get Mr Hartz books.

887
00:43:31,921 --> 00:43:36,921
The Great War is absolutely a classic.
Is One on the naval battle of Jutland in

888
00:43:37,141 --> 00:43:40,090
1916.
Follows the same pattern with his,

889
00:43:40,091 --> 00:43:45,091
um,
context punctuated by oral historian 

890
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:45,660
quotes.
It works so well.

891
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,980
Uh,
he wrote one on passion Dale,

892
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:49,340
um,
which is,

893
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,070
you know,
as you know,

894
00:43:50,071 --> 00:43:51,480
probably awful,
muddy,

895
00:43:51,481 --> 00:43:55,560
horrible,
bloody symbolic of the whole war at that

896
00:43:55,561 --> 00:43:57,900
stage.
And then the new book,

897
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,130
of course,
the last battle,

898
00:43:59,131 --> 00:44:04,131
which focuses on the less well known but
murderous time period in the war and the

899
00:44:05,071 --> 00:44:10,071
phase of the first world war where 
everyone got into the trenches and 

900
00:44:10,071 --> 00:44:13,071
started moving again and began to take 
the kinds of casualties that reminded 

901
00:44:13,071 --> 00:44:16,650
them why they first dug into the ground 
in the first place.

902
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,450
Now,
as an addendum,

903
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,120
a couple of things worth noting.
First of all,

904
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,670
at the very end of the conversation with
Mr Hart,

905
00:44:23,671 --> 00:44:27,150
he was talking about pershing and he was
saying things like,

906
00:44:27,151 --> 00:44:29,010
you know,
on the 10th or even on the 11th,

907
00:44:29,011 --> 00:44:30,510
you know,
he was launching these offensives,

908
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,340
uh,
just a little explanation.

909
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,910
The 10th and the 11th or the November 
10th and November,

910
00:44:35,911 --> 00:44:36,780
11th,
19,

911
00:44:36,781 --> 00:44:40,350
18,
the day before and the day of the end of

912
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:42,690
the war,
the armistice taking effect.

913
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:44,610
Everybody knew that,
you know,

914
00:44:44,611 --> 00:44:47,130
at this hour on this day,
we're going to stop shooting.

915
00:44:47,131 --> 00:44:48,400
So everybody knew,
okay,

916
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,060
the war ends tomorrow,
or the war ends today.

917
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:56,510
So how much does it bother you as a 
soldier in the trenches?

918
00:44:57,031 --> 00:45:02,031
Well,
maybe not even in the trenches at that 

919
00:45:02,031 --> 00:45:03,951
point,
leaning up against a broken down old 

920
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,861
French brick house in a ruined French 
building behind a tank as you're 

921
00:45:06,861 --> 00:45:11,451
prepared to move forward to find out 
that your general wants to launch an 

922
00:45:11,451 --> 00:45:15,711
offensive that's going to cost a lot of 
your lives in the last 24 hours of the 

923
00:45:15,711 --> 00:45:18,150
war or something.
So that's what he was talking about.

924
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,160
You might think in your head of reasons 
why a general might want to do something

925
00:45:25,201 --> 00:45:27,720
like that and play with your own 
motivations for a minute.

926
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,500
Now,
the other thing I wanted to quote was we

927
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:36,501
had mentioned that in the beginning of 
his famous series on the Second World 

928
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:38,700
War,
you can't even call it a history.

929
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:43,860
You should call it almost like a 
personal account from a participant.

930
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:49,240
Uh,
but Churchill's history of the Second 

931
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:49,350
World War has a wonderful start to at 
where he kind of talks about.

932
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,810
He sort of picks up at the end of the 
first world war,

933
00:45:51,811 --> 00:45:56,811
which when you think about it,
it's not a bad way to write the 

934
00:45:56,811 --> 00:45:56,811
histories.
And he talks about,

935
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,500
you know,
the war ending,

936
00:45:58,501 --> 00:46:03,501
when it did,
and what was going to happen if it 

937
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:03,501
didn't,
right what,

938
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:06,090
what the plan was for 19,
19,

939
00:46:06,091 --> 00:46:08,010
and of course the war ends in 1918,
right?

940
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,090
But,
but Churchill says,

941
00:46:09,091 --> 00:46:10,620
if 19,
19 happened,

942
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:13,680
you know,
it was going to unleash terrorists,

943
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:17,610
unlike any of the world had ever seen 
Churchill writes quote.

944
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:23,180
But all that happened in the four years 
of the Great War was only a prelude to 

945
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:27,951
what was preparing for the fifth year.
The campaign of the year in 1919 would 

946
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:33,230
have witnessed an immense,
a session to the powers of destruction 

947
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:36,210
of the Germans retain the morale to make
good their retreat to the Rhine.

948
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,480
They would have been assaulted in the 
summer of 1919 with forces and by 

949
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,940
methods in comparatively more prodigious
than any yet employed.

950
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,150
Thousands of airplanes would have 
shattered their cities.

951
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:53,450
Scores of thousands of Canon would have 
blasted their front arrangements were 

952
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:57,771
being made to carry simultaneously a 
quarter of a million men together with 

953
00:46:57,771 --> 00:47:02,691
all their requirements continuously 
forward across country in mechanical 

954
00:47:02,691 --> 00:47:07,161
vehicles moving 10 or 15 miles each day.
Poison gasses of incredible malignity 

955
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:13,440
against which only a secret mask which 
the Germans could not obtain in time was

956
00:47:13,441 --> 00:47:18,441
proof,
would have stifled all resistance and 

957
00:47:18,441 --> 00:47:20,070
paralyzed all life on the hostile front 
subjected to attack,

958
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:25,490
no doubt the Germans to had their plans,
but the hour of wrath had passed.

959
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:31,190
The signal of relief was given and the 
horrors of 1919 remain buried in the 

960
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:34,870
archives of the great antagonists and 
quote,

961
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:41,300
and it's worth pointing out that even 
with the terrible and horrible 

962
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:44,931
destruction of the Second World War,
there were some of the horrors of the 

963
00:47:44,931 --> 00:47:49,761
first that we're not revisited,
which seems counterintuitive to human 

964
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:51,480
history,
doesn't it?

965
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:57,020
This idea that in total war,
human beings would use every single 

966
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:01,350
weapon at their disposal to fend off 
total destruction.

967
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:07,430
Yet those leaders in the Second World 
War who themselves were younger people 

968
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:12,411
who fought in the first and we 
experienced that somehow managed to not 

969
00:48:12,511 --> 00:48:16,980
use poison gas again on a wide scale,
for example.

970
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:20,740
I don't know what conclusions you can 
draw from that,

971
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:22,840
but it's an interesting variable to 
consider,

972
00:48:22,841 --> 00:48:23,230
isn't it?

973
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,220
Finally,
we had mentioned a,

974
00:48:26,221 --> 00:48:31,221
a,
a note specifically that it's stuck in 

975
00:48:31,221 --> 00:48:33,801
my mind and it obviously stuck in I'm 
Peter Hearts buying to from a soldier 

976
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:39,501
that was writing his turns out to be 
last note home to his family and it 

977
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:45,250
exemplifies the way heart tends to work 
where he will write a piece that sets up

978
00:48:46,081 --> 00:48:49,710
this emotional,
an exclamation point and then deliver it

979
00:48:49,711 --> 00:48:51,660
to you.
And it just stayed.

980
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:55,830
We used it blueprint for armageddon 
because it is so emotionally powerful.

981
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:01,220
So here's what heart rights he's talking
about this battle at the song which he 

982
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:04,911
referenced in the interview,
that terrible British day where they've 

983
00:49:04,911 --> 00:49:06,150
figured out,
oh my gosh,

984
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,580
you know,
this isn't working the way we thought,

985
00:49:08,581 --> 00:49:10,590
and meanwhile we're trying to figure it 
out in the open,

986
00:49:10,591 --> 00:49:13,080
under machine gun fire,
behind a lot of barbed wire.

987
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:18,620
And he says that the soldiers about to 
go on this attack would write these 

988
00:49:18,961 --> 00:49:20,580
letters home to their families

989
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:25,060
and here's what he says.
And then he quotes the powerful letter.

990
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:26,530
He says,
and this is from his book,

991
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:28,000
the Great War,
by the way,

992
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:31,150
quote,
the final reports from the front,

993
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:36,180
meaning of the Somme battle that 
filtered back to the British high 

994
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:36,760
command,
were generally positive in tone.

995
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:42,030
Overall,
the visual impression of the barrage 

996
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:42,400
proved far more devastating than the 
truth on the ground.

997
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:47,700
British progress had been more than 
discounted by German improvements in 

998
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:51,481
their defenses,
but that was not known at the time on 

999
00:49:51,481 --> 00:49:51,670
the British side of the wire.
In any case,

1000
00:49:51,671 --> 00:49:56,671
they had no choice.
The offensive had to go ahead is the 

1001
00:49:56,671 --> 00:49:59,170
future of the alliance with France 
dependent on it in the last few hours as

1002
00:49:59,171 --> 00:50:03,670
Hague's men prepared for the ordeal.
Many wrote their sad last letters.

1003
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:08,671
Home one was so beautifully expressed 
that it exemplifies the feelings of men 

1004
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:13,420
trapped and tormented by the conflicting
calls of country and family.

1005
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,180
Now he's quoting an original letter 
quote,

1006
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,510
I must not allow myself to dwell on the 
personal.

1007
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,730
There's no room for it here.
Also,

1008
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:25,600
it is demoralizing,
but I do not want to die.

1009
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,450
Not that I mind for myself.
If it'd be that I am to go,

1010
00:50:29,451 --> 00:50:32,570
I'm ready,
but the thought that I may never see you

1011
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,930
or are darling baby again turns my 
bowels to water.

1012
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:39,320
I cannot think of it with even the 
semblance of equanimity.

1013
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,700
My one constellation is the happiness 
that has been ours.

1014
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:49,330
Also,
my conscience is clear that I've always 

1015
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,500
tried to make life a joy to you.
I know at least that if I go he will not

1016
00:50:51,501 --> 00:50:53,210
want.
That is something,

1017
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:58,960
but it is the thought that we may be cut
off from one another which is so 

1018
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,321
terrible and that our baby may grow up 
without my knowing her and without her 

1019
00:51:02,321 --> 00:51:03,020
knowing me.

1020
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:08,150
It is difficult to face and I know your 
life without me would be a dull blank.

1021
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:12,050
You must never let it become holy.
So for two,

1022
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:14,720
you will be left the greatest charge and
all the world,

1023
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,170
the upbringing of our baby.
God blessed that child.

1024
00:51:18,171 --> 00:51:21,850
She's the hope of life to me.
My darling are for.

1025
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:27,340
It may be that you will only have to 
read these lines as one of passing 

1026
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:28,550
interest.
On the other hand,

1027
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:34,120
they may well be my last message to you 
if they are no throw all your life that 

1028
00:51:34,311 --> 00:51:39,311
I've loved you and baby with all my 
heart and soul that you to sweet things 

1029
00:51:39,311 --> 00:51:41,540
were just all the world to me.
I pray,

1030
00:51:41,541 --> 00:51:45,650
God that I may do my duty for I know 
whatever that may entail,

1031
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:50,060
you would not have it otherwise,
and to quote Captain Charles,

1032
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:55,061
May Twenty Second Manchester Regiment 
and then Peter Harte writes quote 

1033
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,480
Charles May,
the loving husband of Bessie Mae and the

1034
00:51:59,481 --> 00:52:02,690
father to his baby,
pauline would indeed be killed.

1035
00:52:02,691 --> 00:52:05,690
The next day he's buried in the dancing 
ally,

1036
00:52:05,691 --> 00:52:08,480
British cemetery,
small scale tragedies.

1037
00:52:08,481 --> 00:52:09,680
He writes,
litter,

1038
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:14,681
the history of war,
sad reminders that the necessities of 

1039
00:52:14,681 --> 00:52:18,311
war ruined the lives of millions and the
quote that ladies and gentlemen is an 

1040
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:25,220
art form.
My thanks to Peter Hart for talking with

1041
00:52:25,221 --> 00:52:28,130
us today and listened down the road.
If we're lucky,

1042
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,720
we'll get to do it again.

1043
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:37,780
We've been telling you about audible for
years.

1044
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:40,720
Obviously audio books and a whole lot 
more.

1045
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,420
If you haven't discovered the joys of 
audio books,

1046
00:52:43,421 --> 00:52:48,421
there's elements to it that I think are 
going to develop that I already find 

1047
00:52:48,421 --> 00:52:52,171
fascinating.
Take the element of whose voice it is 

1048
00:52:52,171 --> 00:52:53,680
reading to you,
something you don't consider.

1049
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,420
When you think about getting a book.
Is it,

1050
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:56,830
I mean,
who's the narrator?

1051
00:52:56,831 --> 00:53:01,831
I mean,
I imagine one day you're going to be 

1052
00:53:01,831 --> 00:53:01,831
able to customize this with some sort of
button,

1053
00:53:01,831 --> 00:53:02,020
you know,
with your favorite movie star.

1054
00:53:02,021 --> 00:53:05,650
I went Michael Caine narrating today's 
book and it'll all come out that way,

1055
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:11,910
but I was looking for recommendations 
for today's a particular little 

1056
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:12,640
discussion.
And uh,

1057
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:17,670
Peter Hart,
who we just talked to has a couple of 

1058
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:19,501
books on audible,
but they're narrated by different 

1059
00:53:19,501 --> 00:53:19,501
people.
And so I'm sampling them going,

1060
00:53:19,501 --> 00:53:23,881
okay,
do I want Peter Hart's spoke on the 

1061
00:53:23,881 --> 00:53:23,881
Somme in this voice.

1062
00:53:23,881 --> 00:53:25,950
You're doing what Peter Hearts,
other book on the Somme in other voice.

1063
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,690
And it's interesting because it's an 
element.

1064
00:53:27,691 --> 00:53:29,910
You don't think about this,
a performance aspect to it.

1065
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:34,830
It's one of the things to like about 
audio books as you get to Kinda,

1066
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:40,310
you know,
have different people read to you in 

1067
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:40,310
different voices,
decide what you like.

1068
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:43,581
And like I said,
some day I imagine this will be quite 

1069
00:53:43,581 --> 00:53:44,040
customizable.
Audio books of course been around a long

1070
00:53:44,041 --> 00:53:45,350
time.
So has auto.

1071
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,830
We've been telling you about them for 
years.

1072
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:48,470
They've been supporting us.
Um,

1073
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:51,650
and we've watched as they have,
you know,

1074
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:55,470
sort of rolled out more and more 
features to what they do.

1075
00:53:55,830 --> 00:54:00,830
I mean,
one of the things we've talked about 

1076
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:00,830
that's great about audible,
you know,

1077
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:00,830
you sign up to audible,
you get points,

1078
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:03,540
you get a book that's free every month.
I mean it's one of those membership type

1079
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:05,970
services,
but there's things that they just do,

1080
00:54:05,971 --> 00:54:06,330
right?

1081
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:08,160
I mean they roll over,
you know,

1082
00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:13,270
your points kind of.
So if you don't get a book this month 

1083
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:13,270
while those points accrue,
so the,

1084
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:14,110
you know,
you have more next month.

1085
00:54:14,111 --> 00:54:16,140
He owned the books,
which I love.

1086
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:19,890
It is so weird to me to purchase 
something and then realize,

1087
00:54:19,891 --> 00:54:21,300
wait a minute,
if you read the fine print,

1088
00:54:21,301 --> 00:54:22,590
you don't.
Actually own this,

1089
00:54:22,591 --> 00:54:26,150
you own these books.
If I'm going to buy something like this,

1090
00:54:26,151 --> 00:54:30,050
I want to own it.
I need a big selection too,

1091
00:54:30,051 --> 00:54:33,120
and audibles got one that carry titles 
in business,

1092
00:54:33,121 --> 00:54:35,490
the classics,
fiction history,

1093
00:54:35,491 --> 00:54:36,570
Romance,
mystery,

1094
00:54:36,571 --> 00:54:37,680
thriller,
Sci Fi,

1095
00:54:37,681 --> 00:54:39,480
fantasy,
self-development kids,

1096
00:54:39,481 --> 00:54:39,900
and yeah,
I mean,

1097
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:42,180
you know like a bookstore,
right?

1098
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:46,110
When I was younger,
if you liked audio books,

1099
00:54:46,111 --> 00:54:51,111
you got to go to the library and see 
what they had available on cassette 

1100
00:54:51,111 --> 00:54:54,291
tapes.
Now when a new book comes out and hits 

1101
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:57,360
the bookstores,
digital and brick and mortar,

1102
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:59,160
I'm audible usually has the two.

1103
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:02,910
That's a sign of the popularity of these
things and why not?

1104
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:08,340
It allows you to read a good book,
to motivate yourself,

1105
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:10,830
educate yourself,
entertain yourself,

1106
00:55:10,831 --> 00:55:15,831
make yourself more successful and 
inspired while you're doing some other 

1107
00:55:15,831 --> 00:55:17,550
chore that Does Not Require Your full 
attention.

1108
00:55:17,551 --> 00:55:19,410
You got to mow the lawn.
Well,

1109
00:55:19,411 --> 00:55:20,620
maybe you can,
you know,

1110
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:23,160
get one of those classic books,
read at the same time,

1111
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:25,080
got an iron sheets.
Well,

1112
00:55:25,081 --> 00:55:28,560
why can't you be enjoying a romance 
novel at the same time?

1113
00:55:28,561 --> 00:55:32,940
You get where I'm coming with this.
Busy people are consuming books at rates

1114
00:55:32,941 --> 00:55:35,430
that well when you consider how busy 
they are,

1115
00:55:35,431 --> 00:55:37,560
they shouldn't be able to find the time 
to do that.

1116
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:41,250
Audio books fill a void and audibles the
best place to get them.

1117
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:46,580

1124
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:06,170
If you don't know what to get,
I recommend Peter Hearts two books on 

1125
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:09,921
the somme.
The newer one probably has more updated 

1126
00:56:09,921 --> 00:56:11,070
information.
The official title of that is the Psalm,

1127
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:16,250
the darkest hour on the western front,
but he's got an earlier book on the 

1128
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:18,540
Somme also on audible,
narrated by an English gentleman.

1129
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,170
I believe his name is pronounced.
Uh,

1130
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:24,520
Tim Pickets Smith.
And to me it sounds like Peter Hearts

1131
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,720
actually reading the,
the book.

1132
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:28,660
So the newer book probably has the newer
information,

1133
00:56:28,661 --> 00:56:31,810
but if you really want to have somebody 
reading to you that sounds more like the

1134
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:36,811
author get the earlier book.
The good news is they're both available 

1135
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:38,230
on audible and if you can't decide,
feel free to buy them both.

1136
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,130
Sure.
They older hardcore history shows can be

1137
00:56:46,131 --> 00:56:51,131
a bit traumatic with titles like death 
throes of the republic judgment had been

1138
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:57,041
a va and addicted to bondage.
We just consider that truth in 

1139
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:58,190
advertising.
No pain,

1140
00:56:58,191 --> 00:57:03,191
no gain is our motto.
Pick up the entire catalog from Dan
