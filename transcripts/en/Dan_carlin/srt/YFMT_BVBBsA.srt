1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,850
Some bus,
seventh,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,790
19,
41,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
a date which will live in infamy.
Perfect.

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,640
Leah events.

5
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:31,450
The figure is from this time and place I
take pride in being the Alina tear down 

6
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,790
drama.
Welcome.

7
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,280
This kind of examination,
whether or not their president said,

8
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,870
well,
I'm not a crop.

9
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,570
If we dig deep in our district and our 
doctrine don't remember,

10
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,720
but we are not descended from fearful of
man.

11
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,900
It's hardcore history.
I remember a conversation I had quite a 

12
00:01:19,691 --> 00:01:21,670
long time ago now with an author of a 
book.

13
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,990
The author had written a book about how 
John F Kennedy was assassinated by Lee 

14
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,060
Harvey Oswald,
just like the government always said it 

15
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,060
happened

16
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,840
and I had been asking him a bunch of 
questions about conspiracies and you 

17
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,551
know this or that aspect of the Kennedy 
assassination and only one of his 

18
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:43,771
answers in a really stands out in my 
mind now because it seems irrelevant on 

19
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:49,030
so many different fronts.
One of the answers on why it was so hard

20
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:53,200
for some people to accept what this guy 
was purporting as the truth he said,

21
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:58,201
was because people are inherently very 
uncomfortable with the idea that a 

22
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:04,600
single nobody can have such an effect on
all of our lives.

23
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:09,340
It's more comforting.
He said to believe that powerful,

24
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:14,670
you know,
groups of people or conspiracies are 

25
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,221
actually running things.
Even if you think those powerful groups 

26
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:21,961
are nefarious,
it's somehow comforting to think that 

27
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:24,830
somebody is in charge.
That it's not all just random number,

28
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,780
that a plane couldn't just drop from the
sky and land on your house tomorrow.

29
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,330
And I thought about this when I was 
thinking about know someone,

30
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:40,331
if somebody had asked you a question,
who was the most important figure in the

31
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,550
past hundred years in terms of why the 
world has gone the way it did?

32
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,550
You know,
you would think of all these famous 

33
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,550
people whose names almost anyone who's a
halfway educated would recognize.

34
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:58,510
And yet,
what's interesting is you could 

35
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,250
conceivably put the name down of 
somebody who was historically speaking,

36
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,100
you know,
uh,

37
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:01,840
nobody,

38
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,440
Lee Harvey Oswald on the pages of the 
history books besides the Kennedy 

39
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,020
assassination,
is a nobody,

40
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,150
he didn't do anything else of 
importance,

41
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,700
but that event was huge,
right?

42
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:16,190
If he actually killed John F Kennedy,
the way the narrative says,

43
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,080
Lee Harvey Oswald changed the world,

44
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,690
he changed the president instantly,
right?

45
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:26,691
I mean,
how many of us have the potential to 

46
00:03:26,691 --> 00:03:27,870
change who the president of the United 
States is that lone gunman did,

47
00:03:27,871 --> 00:03:32,871
if he was indeed the lone gunman,
the person who may be most responsible 

48
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:34,500
for the modern world,
this entire world,

49
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:37,630
including the nine slash 11 attacks that
you know,

50
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,410
many commentators say,
shaped the modern world,

51
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:45,411
right?
We live in an era of terrorism or the 

52
00:03:45,411 --> 00:03:49,190
age of terrorism.
You'll hear them say without them 

53
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,931
seeming to really understand that the 
age of terrorism supposedly sparked by 

54
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:51,960
the nine slash 11 attacks and the very,
very,

55
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:56,961
very early 21st century or themselves 
manifestations of an act of terrorism 

56
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,030
that launched us into the 20th century.
If we actually live in an age of 

57
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,960
terrorism,
as some of these people like to say,

58
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,110
we've been living in it for more than 
100 years,

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,400
I think you could make the case that the
most important individual in the last 

60
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,500
century is Gavrilo,
Princip and Gavrilo.

61
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:24,250
Princip is a name.
Very few of you will recognize.

62
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,680
How can a person have so little 
achievement in on the world.

63
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:34,540
Stage B perhaps credited with creating 
the entire world around us.

64
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,150
I mean if,
if Gavrilo Princip doesn't live,

65
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:41,950
is there a nine slash 11 attack ever,
and if that was all he did,

66
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:44,680
wouldn't he be important you a lot more 
than that.

67
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,900
Get principles.
The reason there was a second world war 

68
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,810
because Gavrilo Princip is the reason 
there was a first

69
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:59,710
and to be fair to principal,
if you could have gone to him and shown 

70
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,371
him the ramifications of what that one 
day a week due to the world,

71
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,680
I think he'd be horrified.
He wasn't trying to unleash a global 

72
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:14,141
world war.
He just became the latest example of 

73
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:19,250
someone pulling the trigger in a giant 
historical game of Russian roulette.

74
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,080
A trigger that had been pulled several 
times already with nothing happening.

75
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,800
Who would have thought that the time 
that prince it pulled it,

76
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:33,801
that would be the time that the 
metaphorical revolver pointed at the 

77
00:05:33,871 --> 00:05:37,410
skull of the old world,
shot a bullet into its brain.

78
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,490
Perhaps Princip in his compatriots would
have thought that you know sometimes 

79
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,940
when you're trying to create a new 
world,

80
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:50,420
you have to utterly destroy the old one 
and the people in that old world.

81
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,430
We're not naive about the potential for 
someone like a principal to do what they

82
00:05:56,431 --> 00:05:58,340
did.
I mean Otto von Bismarck,

83
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:01,610
one of the greatest diplomats of 19th 
century Europe,

84
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,070
perhaps the greatest diplomat,
Germany ever produced,

85
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:09,310
famously said that if there was going to
be some giant global conflict,

86
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:14,411
it was going to probably break out 
because of some damn fool event in the 

87
00:06:14,411 --> 00:06:14,411
Balkans.

88
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Governor Lowe Princip shot two people in
the city of Sarajevo smack dab in the 

89
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:26,261
Balkans.
A place that Otto von Bismarck had 

90
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,030
famously said was not worth the bones of
a single Pomeranian Grenna dear.

91
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,420
It would cost a hell of a lot more than 
that and prince,

92
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:38,421
it becomes yet another example in 
history proving to us that sometimes 

93
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:41,310
when it comes to something like 
terrorism in this era,

94
00:06:41,311 --> 00:06:46,311
by the way,
when we tried desperately to keep 

95
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:48,650
weapons of mass destruction out of the 
terrorist hands because we're afraid 

96
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:48,990
they'll be able to kill more people with
such weapons.

97
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,770
We forget that sometimes.
It's not about how many people you kill.

98
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:57,771
Sometimes it's about who they are and 
often it's not the terrorist act that 

99
00:07:00,251 --> 00:07:03,850
changes the world.
It's the response of the victims,

100
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,940
you know,
that does Gov reload.

101
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:11,970
Princip killed two people and he did so 
in a way that almost makes you believe 

102
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:13,870
in fate

103
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,140
and truthfully,
I'm not much of a faith believer,

104
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,400
but one of the things I like about 
history is how it forces me to challenge

105
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,700
some of my own preconceptions and 
certainly make me think about other 

106
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:28,920
possibilities.
I've always thought,

107
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:33,921
for example,
that history unfolds for chaotic 

108
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:37,251
reasons.
We that it's somewhat random that 

109
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:39,690
millions of people going about their 
lives and their own ways with trends and

110
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:43,380
forces acting upon them and people in 
important positions making decisions and

111
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:46,860
all of this together creates a dynamic 
that's completely unpredictable.

112
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:51,861
As I said,
somewhat chaotic and random and unfolds 

113
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:55,101
into the future.
I think my logical side of the brain 

114
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:58,020
appreciates that sort of viewpoint.
The problem is is that sometimes history

115
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,710
confronts us with events where the 
logical part of,

116
00:08:01,711 --> 00:08:06,711
at least my brain wants to flip sides 
and wants to logically defend what I 

117
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:09,600
consider to be the more illogical point 
of view.

118
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:15,050
In this case,
the logical part of my brain will 

119
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,691
sometimes shift and try to defend 
something like fate or destiny or 

120
00:08:19,261 --> 00:08:24,261
predetermination.
Those to me are the two ends of the 

121
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:27,801
scale chaos on one side and randomness 
on one side and fate and predestination 

122
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:32,391
on the other,
and there's this weird twilight zone 

123
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:35,061
where the two sort of intersect and that
event that happened in late June.

124
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,370
Nineteen 14 is one of the best examples 
you'll find from history where you know 

125
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,321
the.
The logical side of your brain stands a 

126
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:47,211
pretty good chance of flipping and 
trying to defend the illogical position 

127
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:49,980
that this is somehow predestined.
I mean,

128
00:08:49,981 --> 00:08:53,820
let me challenge you with a similar kind
of analogy.

129
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,780
Assumingly Harvey Oswald did kill 
President Kennedy.

130
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,290
What if someone showed up right when he 
had the rifle and he was aiming at in 

131
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,310
the room where he was forcing him to 
sort of Scotch.

132
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,310
The whole thing screwed up.
The whole assassination attempt at the 

133
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,680
last minute,
you know,

134
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:13,950
Oswald's storms out of the Texas book 
depository,

135
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:18,951
angry that is well laid.
Plans have been destroyed and he goes 

136
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:23,691
across town to his favorite restaurant 
and he goes and he gets himself a bite 

137
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:23,691
to eat and when he's coming out of the 
restaurant,

138
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:26,490
angry at how his day has gone right in 
front of him.

139
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:30,750
Within five or six feet,
stopped below him.

140
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Is John F Kennedy's car with Kennedy in 
it close to Oswald and on the far side 

141
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:39,900
of the president,
his wife Jackie.

142
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,890
What are the odds of something like that
happening?

143
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,670
What would you think if it did?
Just a weird coincidence,

144
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,030
Huh?
On June 28th,

145
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:50,940
19,
14,

146
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,780
Gavrilo Princip and about 20 other guys.
This is a true conspiracy show up in the

147
00:09:57,061 --> 00:10:00,120
city of Sarajevo with murder on their 
minds.

148
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,100
They want to kill the the governing 
figure.

149
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:10,150
I'm in Sarajevo.
The person who is sort of the Prince 

150
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,300
Charles plays the same role.
Prince Charles plays in the British 

151
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,391
monarchy right now in the monarchy of 
the country that are the overlords in 

152
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,860
Sarajevo country that doesn't exist 
anymore.

153
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:22,740
Called Austria.
Hungary and Austria.

154
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:27,741
Hungary is led by a really old,
very well loved guy named Franz Joseph 

155
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:32,331
who's going to die soon because he's 
very old and the person who will take 

156
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,070
over when Franz Joseph dies is this guy 
coming on a visit to Siri,

157
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,090
afo the Prince Charles of his country.
Although unlike Prince Charles,

158
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:44,091
who's role is completely ceremonial,
this guy will actually have some real 

159
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:47,961
power when he gets the throne and for 
some you know now when you look back on 

160
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:52,581
it looks like a stupid reason.
This guy whose name is archduke Franz 

161
00:10:52,581 --> 00:10:57,470
Ferdinand,
has decided to go to Sarajevo and watch 

162
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,901
military maneuvers which happened to 
coincide with the anniversary of the 

163
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:02,070
most emotionally important,
heart wrenching,

164
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,280
you know,
battlefield lost in all Serb history,

165
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:10,340
the battle of Kosovo way back from 
hundreds and hundreds of years before 

166
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:10,530
this time period.

167
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,220
Certain nationalists and the Serbs are 
very,

168
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:16,140
very patriotic.
Even today,

169
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,200
even more so back in 1914.
Look at this as a slap in the face to 

170
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:22,510
them,
sorry.

171
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:27,511
A Vo is Slavic and should be part of at 
least a Pan Slavic country or maybe part

172
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:33,051
of Serbia.
There had been Balkan wars for the last 

173
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:33,051
decade,
you know,

174
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:37,671
concerned with many of these 
nationalistic questions who should own 

175
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:40,431
these areas and it had been in the hands
of the Ottoman Turks who the slavs 

176
00:11:40,431 --> 00:11:41,070
definitely feel,
shouldn't have been running the place.

177
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,070
And it was transferred to the hands of 
the Austria Hungarian empire,

178
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:47,640
which the Serb nationalists still don't 
feel should be running the place.

179
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,890
And now the archduke was coming on the 
anniversary of this historic defeat.

180
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:58,180
You know from the Serb nationalist 
viewpoint to rub their nose in the fact 

181
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,280
that Siri,
Eva was still held by a big non slavic 

182
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:02,280
empire

183
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,800
and they're going to make Franz 
Ferdinand pay for that and in the 

184
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,940
remarkably similar situation to the 
Kennedy assassination,

185
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:15,530
Ferdinand's route for his motorcade is 
published ahead of time.

186
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,890
He's going to be arriving and going down
the main boulevards in an open car with 

187
00:12:22,011 --> 00:12:27,011
his wife sitting next to him.
He's 20 or so assassins line themselves 

188
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:32,561
up at various intervals on this parade 
route and planned to kill the archduke 

189
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:37,030
as soon as they can.
The archduke car is either going too 

190
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,650
fast or there are too many other serves 
in the crowd nearby.

191
00:12:39,651 --> 00:12:44,651
The first few assassins,
so the first few assassins don't try to 

192
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:44,651
make a run at him.
Eventually he passes.

193
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:47,480
One guy who runs out from the crowd with
a bomb,

194
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,900
really more of a hand grenade would be a
good way to describe it today,

195
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,200
and he flings this hand grenade at the 
archduke open car in a very athletic 

196
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:56,690
maneuver.

197
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,870
The archduke sees it ducks behind the 
door of the car,

198
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,480
the hand grenade thing bounces off the 
car,

199
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:07,481
hits the concrete on the street,
and the fuse doesn't detonate until the 

200
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,730
next car in the motorcade has passed 
over it.

201
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:14,750
It explodes.
Some 20 people are badly hurt in a blood

202
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:15,740
on the street.
The whole thing.

203
00:13:15,741 --> 00:13:17,150
Chaos.
The crowd scatters.

204
00:13:17,151 --> 00:13:19,940
I mean obviously you know,
the parade is over.

205
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:25,780
The would be assassins shoves a cyanide 
pill into his mouth and runs down into 

206
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:28,250
the side of the street and jumps in the 
river,

207
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,740
but the cyanide pill is defective and 
only makes them vomit and the river is 

208
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,230
only about six inches deep.
So they capture him very quickly and run

209
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:41,231
him off to be interrogated.
And basically the whole day is now 

210
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:41,930
scotched.
All the other assassins along the parade

211
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:45,980
route have had their chance,
spoiled and everybody breaks up and goes

212
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:48,980
their separate ways.
The crowd dissipates and the motorcade,

213
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,180
you know,
takes off in a couple of different 

214
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,180
directions.
The injured or taken to hospitals in the

215
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,761
archduke goes to the local magistrates 
residents to lodge a complaint.

216
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,480
So you think,
okay,

217
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:06,481
there's a bullet dodge literally,
so after complaining to the local 

218
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:10,390
authority is the archduke decides 
instead of just leaving town,

219
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:10,910
I mean,
you know,

220
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,920
he almost got killed,
but instead of leaving town in a very 

221
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:15,920
heroic sort of,
um,

222
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:21,190
movie decides no,
he needs to visit the people injured in 

223
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,911
the bombing,
just going to go to the hospital and he 

224
00:14:23,911 --> 00:14:27,301
gets back into the open car with his 
wife and they speed off toward the 

225
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:31,720
hospital to talk to the wounded and 
comfort the wounded.

226
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,140
The local authorities are worried,
as you might imagine.

227
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,890
So they give him some extra security,
including one guy who was,

228
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:42,680
I'm a member of a local aristocracy 
account named France Bon Herat.

229
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,330
And her rock takes a position on the 
running board right by the archduke side

230
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:50,730
of the car and they speed off for the 
hospital.

231
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:54,680
Now no one knows where the arch duke is 
going now.

232
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:57,230
None of the people who were would be 
assassins or anything.

233
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:02,231
This is not a published route.
Nobody knows that the archduke is 

234
00:15:02,231 --> 00:15:03,500
heading in this direction.
So the car drives toward the hospital.

235
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,740
Meanwhile,
you know Gavrilo Princip has gone to get

236
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:09,650
a sandwich,
mean his day has been totally destroyed.

237
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,950
He couldn't have been in a good mood.
He must've felt like they'd failed 

238
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,471
somewhat and the driver of the archduke 
car not really knowing the route very 

239
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:19,460
well,
charged down a street,

240
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:24,050
realizes he's on the wrong street and 
reverses the car,

241
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,160
but this is 1914 and cars are relatively
new and simply reversing a car could 

242
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,970
stall the engine,
which is exactly what happens.

243
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:34,130
He tries to reverse the car,
the engine stalls,

244
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,990
and there it is sitting,
not moving,

245
00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:40,991
and they're trying to get it started 
again and out of the restaurant where 

246
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:45,011
he'd gone to get that,
I guess you could say constellation 

247
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,520
Sandwich to make them feel a little bit 
better about how his bad day went.

248
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:52,330
Steps Gavrilo Princip who looks up and 
sees his target from a little while ago,

249
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:59,170
five feet away from him,
immobile and slightly below him in an 

250
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:00,920
open car

251
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:06,760
and he whips out his pistol and shoots 
him and his wife.

252
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:13,410
What are the odds of that happening?
It's considered to be one of the most 

253
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:19,141
wild coincidences in all of human 
history and we sometimes forget because 

254
00:16:22,151 --> 00:16:27,151
it's such a monumental historical moment
that this is still a terrorist attack 

255
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:32,020
and it was quite upsetting to either 
witness or lived through.

256
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:38,590
Part of what makes these things seemed 
so unreal is that we only have grainy 

257
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,830
black and white footage of even the 
events before that you can go see movies

258
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:47,831
where you can see the archduke and his 
wife getting ready to go into the 

259
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:51,011
motorcade and you get an idea of what 
they looked like and it's all kind of 

260
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,741
moving a little too fast.
The way those old fashioned movies were 

261
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:53,741
and everything and it just doesn't look 
real.

262
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:58,450
But you can go and you can see pictures 
because they have saved the tunic that 

263
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,561
the archduke was wearing that day and 
you can see in living color that this 

264
00:17:02,561 --> 00:17:07,121
was a bright light blue tunic and the 
feathers on the helmet he was wearing 

265
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:07,430
were bright green.
I mean,

266
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:09,320
it must've been the most colorful site 
imaginable,

267
00:17:09,321 --> 00:17:14,321
but after princip fired the most 
colorful site imaginable became a lot 

268
00:17:14,321 --> 00:17:18,041
more gory.
Because there's a tear in the tunic 

269
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:21,790
where the bullet exited the archduke 
neck and the tunic is covered and what 

270
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:25,400
is unmistakably.
Even 100 years later,

271
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:30,401
blood and blood has always been one of 
those things where when you see it in 

272
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:33,080
living color,
there's nothing like it.

273
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:38,590
I tend to believe human beings are 
programmed to react to that specific 

274
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,080
color,
you know,

275
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:44,081
always,
and the difference between seeing blood 

276
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:46,100
in black and white and blood and color 
is there's nothing quite like that.

277
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:49,980
The person who was closest

278
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,440
to the whole thing was count von 
[inaudible],

279
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,700
who was on the running board,
not doing that great of a job apparently

280
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,830
at security,
and he says,

281
00:17:58,831 --> 00:18:02,640
as soon as the shots were fired,
they reversed the car

282
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:06,930
and he later testified this quote,

283
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:12,860
as the car quickly reversed,
a thin stream of blood spurted from his 

284
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,350
highness,
his mouth onto my right cheek.

285
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,710
As I was pulling out my handkerchief to 
wipe the blood away from his mouth.

286
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,770
The dutchess cried out to him.
For God's sake.

287
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,920
What has happened to you at that?
She slid off the seat and lay on the 

288
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,680
floor of the car with her face between 
his knees.

289
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,580
I had no idea that she too was hit and 
thought that she had simply fainted with

290
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:32,400
fright.
Then I heard his imperial highness say,

291
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,840
Sophie,
Sophie,

292
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:36,360
don't die.
Stay alive for the children.

293
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,720
At that I seized the archduke by the 
collar of his uniform to stop his head 

294
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,290
drooping forward and asked him if he was
in great pain.

295
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,960
He answered me quite distinctly.
It is nothing.

296
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:51,350
His face began to twist somewhat,
but he went on repeating six or seven 

297
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,070
times evermore faintly as he gradually 
lost consciousness.

298
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,280
It's nothing.
Then came a brief pause followed by a 

299
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,820
convulsive rattling his throat caused by
the loss of blood.

300
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,640
This ceased on arrival at the governor's
residence.

301
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:07,910
That to unconscious bodies were carried 
into the building where their death was 

302
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:07,910
soon established.

303
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:13,130
End Quote,
and as a way to sort of prove that the 

304
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,171
old adage that one man's terrorist is 
another man's freedom fighter is true.

305
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,560
The spot where princip was standing when
he fired those fatal shots are 

306
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:26,440
immortalized now in the city of 
Sarajevo.

307
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,580
With a plaque and the actual footsteps,
you know,

308
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,660
in metal on the ground where the spot 
was to Serbs,

309
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,520
this guy was a hero and to his 
compatriots who all realized that they 

310
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,661
were like Desperados at the time.
They all realized that they would be 

311
00:19:45,701 --> 00:19:47,200
immortalized too,

312
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:53,790
and the actual circumstances by the way,
where this plot was hatched are worthy 

313
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:59,041
of a spy novel and it's hard to believe 
it hasn't been romanticized to some 

314
00:19:59,041 --> 00:19:59,041
degree.
But nevertheless,

315
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:03,730
if you ever do the definitive big screen
dramatization of World War One,

316
00:20:03,731 --> 00:20:06,760
the whole story.
I think you want to start your movie off

317
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:12,210
with that scene inside that Belgrade 
cafe obscure place Kinda run down lit 

318
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:18,961
only by candle light with a group of 19 
and 20 year old guys at a table.

319
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,860
I always have to remind myself how young
these people are not old enough to 

320
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,150
legally drink alcohol in the United 
States is how old these people are.

321
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:32,530
And then we're told by people who were 
there that what happened is one of their

322
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,050
number comes in the door,
sits down at the table with them and has

323
00:20:35,051 --> 00:20:40,051
a package with him.
And he opens up the package and inside 

324
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:41,140
is only one thing,
a newspaper clipping.

325
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,150
No,
no,

326
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,410
no,
not signed it by anybody.

327
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,690
No directions,
just a newspaper clipping.

328
00:20:46,691 --> 00:20:47,890
And the clipping announces

329
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,140
the imminent visit of the archduke Franz
Ferdinand to Siri,

330
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:57,150
Ava,
one of the people who was at that table 

331
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:01,441
and lived to grow older and write about 
his experiences after he'd had time to 

332
00:21:01,441 --> 00:21:05,380
go from terrorists to Patriot,
a guy named Jeff Church.

333
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,710
And if I mispronounced that by the way,
let's just get used to that.

334
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,400
This is going to be perhaps the most 
linguistically and essentially 

335
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,151
challenging show I've ever done.
And I'm sure to mangle many beautiful 

336
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:18,151
languages,
uh,

337
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:22,801
first and foremost French.
So my apologies to all of you in 

338
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:25,741
advance.
I'm sorry I have limitations and you're 

339
00:21:25,741 --> 00:21:27,280
going to hear them all.
I'm bored.

340
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:32,281
Shoved Jeff Church wrote years later 
this about that moment in history that 

341
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:37,231
will turn out to be so very important in
a way that you can't imagine anyone at 

342
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:41,191
the table then would have known they 
didn't know they were pulling the 

343
00:21:41,191 --> 00:21:42,190
trigger again and that Russian roulette 
game.

344
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,880
And they certainly didn't know that if 
they were,

345
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:46,480
that was the time there was going to be 
a bullet in the chamber.

346
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,180
So you have to troll,
you know,

347
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,270
after the fact,
quote,

348
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,750
a tiny clipping from a newspaper mailed 
without comment from a secret band of 

349
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,340
terrorists in Zagreb,
a capital of Croatia,

350
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,520
to their comrades in Belgrade was the 
torch which set the world of fire with 

351
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,811
the war in 1914,
that bit of paper wrecked old proud 

352
00:22:06,811 --> 00:22:09,940
empires.
It gave birth to new free nations.

353
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,090
I was one of the members of the 
terrorist band in Belgrade,

354
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:18,390
which received it.
And in those days I and my companions 

355
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,290
were regarded as desperate criminals.
A price was on our heads.

356
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:25,530
Today,
my little band is seen in a different 

357
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,721
light as pioneer patriots.
It is recognized that our secret plans 

358
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:32,400
hatched in an obscure cafe and the 
capital of old Serbia have led to the 

359
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,750
independence of the new Yugoslavia,
the United Nation set free from Austrian

360
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,550
domination.

361
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,780
And to quote now,
ever since that time,

362
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,140
people have been wondering how connected
that group was to outside entities.

363
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:52,770
No,
they just a bunch of small little self 

364
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,520
organized terror groups put together by 
a bunch of young kids,

365
00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:56,860
or are they working for a larger entity 
today?

366
00:22:56,861 --> 00:23:01,240
We would ask whether or not they were an
example of state sponsored terrorism.

367
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,070
Was there a power behind this group 
arrival power,

368
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:11,310
I mean in to understand how big of a 
deal this could be in a Europe that was 

369
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,911
already kind of unsteady and stressed in
terms of stability.

370
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:20,560
Imagine the United States president or a
president or two from now.

371
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:25,450
We don't want to be controversial down 
the road is assassinated and we have all

372
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:30,451
the shock and anger and desire for 
retribution that comes with that and 

373
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,260
then very shortly after an assassin is 
captured,

374
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:37,620
we figure out that that assassin is 
working with the intelligence service 

375
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,360
for our most antagonistic enemy.
I mean,

376
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:45,361
think for a second how America would 
have reacted if Lee Harvey Oswald had 

377
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:50,120
been a hit man for Moscow and that came 
to light,

378
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,220
which by the way is not that outrageous 
thing to consider.

379
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:59,180
When you look at Oswald's ties to the 
Soviet Union and Cuba,

380
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,080
think about how the American people 
would have reacted regardless of what 

381
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,670
the facts were if they thought that was 
the case,

382
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:14,270
and it's interesting to note that that's
only a year after the Cuban missile 

383
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,751
crisis,
a year after world war three is 

384
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:20,391
potentially dodged.
What do you think the leaders of the 

385
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:21,090
United States after Kennedy is 
assassinated,

386
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:25,500
are worried about in terms of worst case
scenarios?

387
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,980
Do you think it might have occurred to 
them men who by the early 19 sixties had

388
00:24:31,051 --> 00:24:35,280
grown up during and in the immediate 
years after the first World War,

389
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,540
do you think they might have been seeing
in their mind's eye history,

390
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:44,541
repeating itself?
A world leader killed by a gunman in an 

391
00:24:45,241 --> 00:24:50,241
open car with his wife sitting next to 
him in public by a young person may be 

392
00:24:54,391 --> 00:24:59,391
working for a foreign government and 
then having the world spiral out of 

393
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:03,780
control despite what the major players 
may have wanted.

394
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:09,020
Do you think the people around Kennedy 
might have worried a little about how 

395
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:12,201
that might have turned out?
Because those guys in that cafe very 

396
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:14,370
well may have been working for the 
Serbian intelligence service.

397
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:19,230
There's been a lot written about this.
No one knows for sure.

398
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,430
They certainly have ties to groups that 
the United States today,

399
00:25:24,431 --> 00:25:29,431
if we were ranking groups from 1914,
would probably call terrorist groups 

400
00:25:29,431 --> 00:25:33,160
like young Bosnia and another one called
the black hand,

401
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:36,550
and these groups had ties sometimes to 
the Serbian intelligence service,

402
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:39,100
so you can believe the historian where 
the investigator,

403
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:40,960
you want to believe it's a hot button 
issue.

404
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,270
Nonetheless,
it isn't so important.

405
00:25:43,271 --> 00:25:48,271
What really happened,
just like it isn't so important whether 

406
00:25:48,271 --> 00:25:48,670
or not Oswald was working for the Soviet
Union.

407
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:54,100
What's important is what did the people 
on the ground effected by this think was

408
00:25:54,101 --> 00:25:59,101
happening.
The US public thought Oswald was a 

409
00:25:59,101 --> 00:25:59,101
hitman from Moscow.
What happens then?

410
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:03,840
The Austrians thought the killing of 
their heir to the throne was an active 

411
00:26:03,971 --> 00:26:07,210
state sponsored terrorism,
and if it wasn't,

412
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,510
they were going to make the case that it
was anyway.

413
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,610
There's really no doubt that the 
Austrian Hungarian Empire wanted to deal

414
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:20,790
with this Serbian problem that had been 
bedeviling it for some time,

415
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:23,490
once and for all,
and to be honest,

416
00:26:23,491 --> 00:26:28,491
it's hard to blame them.
I mean the Serbians and the Slavs will 

417
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:33,440
counter with the idea that the 
Austro-hungarian had not possess this 

418
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,890
territory for very long.
Bosnia Herzegovina and places like Siri,

419
00:26:35,891 --> 00:26:38,490
Ava had not been Austro-hungarian for a 
long time.

420
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,360
Nevertheless,
you try to think of what nation state on

421
00:26:42,361 --> 00:26:44,100
the planet could put

422
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:49,100
up with the nation over their border 
fomenting revolution in their country 

423
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,850
and eventually killing their public 
figures.

424
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:52,740
I mean,
imagine if you're an American.

425
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:58,130
This happening in the United States.
Imagine say Mexico creating instability 

426
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:05,511
and unrest and fomenting subversion and 
revolution in places like southern Texas

427
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,060
and southern New Mexico and southern 
Arizona and southern California,

428
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:14,180
and then eventually these 
revolutionaries that have been Egged on 

429
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,190
by the Mexican intelligence service kill
a major US public figure.

430
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,700
How long do you think United States will
put up with something like that?

431
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:27,350
The reason it becomes so important 
though is because of all the many 

432
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:31,671
controversies in the story.
One of the most enduring and important 

433
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,490
is who's fault.
Everything that's about to happen is you

434
00:27:36,491 --> 00:27:38,230
know,
if this is a civil lawsuit,

435
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,280
trying to figure out who's responsible 
for damages is a key part of this story 

436
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:48,860
and the Austrian Hungarian Empire is in 
a position to decide to go or not to go 

437
00:27:49,621 --> 00:27:50,100
to war.

438
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,870
That seems to put them in the driver's 
seat.

439
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:56,490
Responsibility Wise,
there are Austrians though,

440
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:01,850
living at the time who basically say,
what choice did they have?

441
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,010
Take this Austrian writing after the war
as a perfect example.

442
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,700
He talks about archduke.
Franz Ferdinand is one of the best 

443
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,520
friends the slavs ever had,
and in effect,

444
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:20,180
Ferdinand actually was counseling his 
government to treat the Serbian problem 

445
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,970
more lightly because he was worried 
about it's sparking a general war.

446
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,600
When he was killed,
it was seen as an extra perfidious act 

447
00:28:30,481 --> 00:28:34,770
because the Slavic folks had killed a 
person who had been,

448
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,220
you know,
one of their better friends in the 

449
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,661
Austrian government.
The Austrian that I was telling you 

450
00:28:41,661 --> 00:28:44,970
about a second ago after the first World
War wrote this quote,

451
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,710
when the news of the murder of archduke 
Franz Ferdinand arrived in Munich.

452
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,070
I happened to be sitting at home and 
heard of it only vaguely.

453
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:58,340
I was at first seized with worry that 
the bullets may have been shot from the 

454
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,761
pistols of German students who have 
indignation at the heirs apparent 

455
00:29:01,761 --> 00:29:04,830
continuous work of Slava.
Ization wanted to free the German people

456
00:29:04,831 --> 00:29:09,831
from this internal enemy.
What the consequence of this would have 

457
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,981
been,
was easy to imagine a new wave of 

458
00:29:12,981 --> 00:29:15,470
persecution which now would have been 
justified and explained in the eyes of 

459
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:19,050
the whole world.
But when soon afterward I heard the name

460
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:24,051
of the supposed that assassins and 
moreover read that they had been 

461
00:29:24,051 --> 00:29:27,231
identified as Serbs.
A light shutter began to run through me 

462
00:29:27,231 --> 00:29:28,440
at this vengeance of inscrutable 
destiny.

463
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,800
The greatest friend of the slobs had 
fallen beneath the bullets of Slavic 

464
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,460
fanatics.
Anyone he says,

465
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:40,670
with constant occasion in the last years
to observe the relation of Austria to 

466
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,501
Serbia,
could not for a be in doubt that the 

467
00:29:44,501 --> 00:29:46,750
stone had been set rolling whose course 
could no longer be arrested.

468
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:53,030
Those who today he writes,
shower the Viennese government with 

469
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,720
reproaches on the form and content of 
this ultimatum.

470
00:29:54,721 --> 00:29:59,721
It issued do it an injustice.
No other power in the world could have 

471
00:29:59,721 --> 00:30:03,981
acted differently in the same situation 
and the same position at her south 

472
00:30:03,981 --> 00:30:08,311
eastern border,
Austria possessed in an Oxford and 

473
00:30:08,311 --> 00:30:09,180
mortal enemy who had shorter and shorter
intervals,

474
00:30:09,181 --> 00:30:14,181
kept challenging the monarchy and would 
never have left off until the moment 

475
00:30:14,181 --> 00:30:17,710
favorable for the shattering of the 
empire had arrived and quote.

476
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,740
I actually agree with that and it makes 
me uncomfortable because the Austrian 

477
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,281
writing that statement after the first 
world war is the man most responsible 

478
00:30:28,281 --> 00:30:30,780
for beginning the second adult Hitler.

479
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:37,590
The one line that I think Hitler Eridean
though was his line that this stone had 

480
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:42,571
been set rolling,
that nothing could arrest because 

481
00:30:42,571 --> 00:30:44,110
something could have arrested it because
something had been arresting it.

482
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:46,420
There's a reason that the ostrow 
Hungarians had an attack.

483
00:30:46,421 --> 00:30:51,421
The Serbs are ready,
and the reason was that the Serbs had a 

484
00:30:51,421 --> 00:30:54,731
very powerful friend,
the Russians who considered themselves 

485
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,290
the traditional protectors of the Slavs 
and the Serbs were not alone.

486
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:04,590
Most of the powers of Europe had at 
least one and usually more powerful 

487
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:09,190
friends and allies.
This was the era in European history and

488
00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:14,191
it's often used as an example of one of 
the main reasons this whole story 

489
00:31:14,191 --> 00:31:17,230
unfolds the way it does.
This is the era of a very complex web of

490
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:21,130
alliances that bind European countries 
to each other.

491
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:26,320
It's perhaps the most enduring work of 
Otto von Bismarck can.

492
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,660
We mentioned earlier the 19th century 
German diplomat,

493
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,560
bismarck played a very large role in the
foundation of modern Germany,

494
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,970
but he also played a huge role in 
creating a system of alliances that both

495
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,220
expanded,
you know,

496
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:43,230
Germany's possibilities while at the 
same time preserving a general peace in 

497
00:31:43,961 --> 00:31:46,930
Europe.
There were wars between Napoleon and the

498
00:31:46,931 --> 00:31:51,931
first world war.
There's no doubt about that and some of 

499
00:31:51,931 --> 00:31:54,151
them were directly the fault of Bismark,
but there wasn't a general European 

500
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:59,161
conflict involving all the major powers 
and let's not forget that this is an era

501
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:03,130
that we would today call a multipolar 
world,

502
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:07,420
which is hard for us to understand in an
era of one or two super powers.

503
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,840
Europe during this time period had at 
least five first rate power states,

504
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,520
Britain,
France,

505
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,410
Germany,
Russia,

506
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:21,580
and the Austrian Hungarian Empire.
Many people throw in Turkey and Italy to

507
00:32:21,581 --> 00:32:24,130
which would make seven.
These states all,

508
00:32:24,131 --> 00:32:29,131
we're bound to each other with complex 
alliance systems and complex is the way 

509
00:32:30,711 --> 00:32:35,711
bismarck wanted it.
Bismarck had set it up so that basically

510
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:39,170
no matter what happened,
he was in the driver's

511
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,880
and this worked unbelievably well,
especially for German interests,

512
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:46,610
but for European interests as well as a 
whole for a long time.

513
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:52,330
But by the time 1914 rolls around this 
genius who create this system that's so 

514
00:32:52,731 --> 00:32:54,770
complex,
only he knew how to run it.

515
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,220
I've taken whole courses on Biz markie 
and diplomacy from professors who spent 

516
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,410
their whole life studying it and they 
don't know why he did some of the things

517
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:07,640
he did while he was running it.
It was fantastic.

518
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,500
By the time 1914 rolls around,
he hasn't been running it for some time.

519
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,520
He'd been fired by the leader of Germany
and now this complex machine that the 

520
00:33:20,001 --> 00:33:24,170
genius of Bismarck had created and run 
was being run by people who couldn't,

521
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:29,820
you know,
carry his jockstrap is what we used to 

522
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,441
say.
It was inevitable that something like 

523
00:33:32,441 --> 00:33:35,831
that would break down the reason that 
the Austra Hungarians didn't just march 

524
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:38,120
into Serbia,
you know,

525
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:43,121
the minute they found out that the Serbs
were responsible for killing their heir 

526
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:46,631
to the throne,
is that they knew that would mean war 

527
00:33:46,631 --> 00:33:49,031
with Russia and that is something that 
the ostrow Hungarians were not prepared 

528
00:33:49,031 --> 00:33:49,031
for.

529
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:54,550
At least not without checking with their
main friend on the world stage and 

530
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,430
finding out,
you know,

531
00:33:55,431 --> 00:34:00,170
what they would do in that situation.
Their main friend on the world stage was

532
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:05,171
the German empire.
Now the German empires attitude is very 

533
00:34:05,171 --> 00:34:07,070
interesting.
The first thing I have to keep reminding

534
00:34:07,071 --> 00:34:12,071
myself about the German Empire during 
this era is that it's relatively young.

535
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:15,230
It's a new country almost.
It was only founded in 18,

536
00:34:15,231 --> 00:34:20,231
71.
I was like 40 years before this era and 

537
00:34:20,231 --> 00:34:24,461
it wasn't just a new country.
The minute it was proclaimed and that's 

538
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:25,040
how it happened.
You didn't proclaiming England,

539
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:27,410
you didn't proclaim France,
but Germany is a modern nation.

540
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,080
There was like a day where people signed
papers and okay,

541
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:35,081
the next day as of tomorrow,
Germany exists and the minute it 

542
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:39,071
existed,
it was the most powerful land power in 

543
00:34:39,071 --> 00:34:41,330
Europe with a larger population than 
France.

544
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:46,360
Traditionally the greatest land power in
Europe up till this time period and a 

545
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,160
larger faster birth rate and more 
industry,

546
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:54,550
and how destabilizing would it be in our
world today if a couple of different 

547
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:59,141
nations of moderate power signed a piece
of paper tomorrow that united them into 

548
00:34:59,141 --> 00:35:01,850
one country and that one now combined 
country was the most powerful country in

549
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:02,420
the world.

550
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:08,260
Even if it was just the most powerful 
land power or the most powerful see 

551
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,681
power,
you can see how a bunch of nations that 

552
00:35:11,681 --> 00:35:13,901
really didn't deserve a lot of the perks
that the super great nations claim for 

553
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:17,771
themselves might all of a sudden do that
once they turn themselves into a super 

554
00:35:17,771 --> 00:35:20,210
nation in 18,
71 with the creation of Germany,

555
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:20,990
the Kaiser,
right?

556
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:25,250
You have an instant great power on the 
world stage.

557
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,880
It was Prussia on steroids with a 
population like eight times as much and 

558
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:37,031
the rest of Germany with the militarized
on the Prussian model with the Prussian 

559
00:35:37,031 --> 00:35:37,031
King.

560
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:43,420
That's a very destabilizing thing and 
when that country begins to demand some 

561
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,900
of the perks that the other great powers
have,

562
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,970
you know,
have their own France,

563
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,830
Great Britain,
they've got all these colonies,

564
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:54,010
all these other things,
little Holland to them looks like 

565
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:54,830
they've got places all over the world.
What's going on?

566
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:58,480
Sort of a factor of just having been 
there for awhile.

567
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,700
If you were around during the age of 
exploration and you had a bunch of ships

568
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,200
out there,
you were getting colonies.

569
00:36:03,201 --> 00:36:06,200
Germany didn't come around until most of
the good stuff was taken.

570
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,030
Was a cause of instability.
Germany worried about being encircled.

571
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,840
That powers all around them that didn't 
wish them well.

572
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,310
His Neil Ferguson,
I'm in.

573
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:23,350
The thing that I really thought was was 
quite wonderful because here in the 

574
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,230
west,
those of us who fought the German empire

575
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,600
famously said that they had this sort of
paranoia about being encircled.

576
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,180
They were always worried about being 
encircled.

577
00:36:29,181 --> 00:36:34,181
We'll look at them on a map.
They're born in circle there in central 

578
00:36:34,181 --> 00:36:35,230
Europe.
They've got enemy is all around them.

579
00:36:35,231 --> 00:36:38,940
Neil Ferguson said they weren't paranoid
about being historical.

580
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,960
They were being encircled and they were 
worried about an upcoming war and up 

581
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:48,080
until Otto von Bismarck goes away,
he had neutralized Russia.

582
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:51,080
That was one of the main things in his 
diplomatic alliance system.

583
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:55,460
Keep the Russians happy.
He said it in a five superpower world.

584
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:58,220
Make sure your country's one of three.
Right?

585
00:36:58,221 --> 00:37:03,221
So it's always three against two and 
Russia was always to be kept on your 

586
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,881
good side when he was sacked and 
basically the foreign policy begins to 

587
00:37:06,881 --> 00:37:09,350
be heavily influenced by the German 
Kaiser.

588
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,540
The Emperor Kaiser Means Caesar,
by the way.

589
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:16,340
So imagine you know,
calling your Emperor Caesar in 1914.

590
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,030
In any case,
the Kaiser was a strange guy.

591
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:25,330
He sacks bismarck because bismarck's 
kind of talking down to him and is kind 

592
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:28,871
of running the show and he's an old guy 
by then in these much revered and you 

593
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:28,910
know,
how do you grow into your own man?

594
00:37:28,911 --> 00:37:30,470
Would that guy hanging over your 
shoulder?

595
00:37:30,471 --> 00:37:35,471
So he fires him and he allows that 
machine to make vital mistakes bismarck 

596
00:37:35,471 --> 00:37:36,020
never would have made with that 
diplomatic machine.

597
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:37,250
Vital mistake,
number one,

598
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:42,700
he lost the Russians.
He intentionally drove them away 

599
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,220
basically

600
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,320
right into the hands of the French,
the historic German enemy,

601
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,960
the one that they had beaten in the 
Franco Prussian war in 18,

602
00:37:50,961 --> 00:37:53,540
78 slash 71.
That allowed them to proclaim the German

603
00:37:53,541 --> 00:37:58,541
empire,
which they did in the French palace of 

604
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:01,151
Versailles,
which is sort of a rub your nose in it 

605
00:38:01,151 --> 00:38:03,581
kind of thing.
The Germans and the French assumed 

606
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:07,361
they'd fight each other again someday.
Now the French were allied with the 

607
00:38:07,361 --> 00:38:10,580
Russians and now the German fears of 
encirclement had become a reality.

608
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,540
The Germans had been trying to plan for 
what they're going to do with a war,

609
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:19,850
you know,
against an enemy to their west and 

610
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:20,720
another enemy to their east at the same 
time.

611
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:21,950
Right.
How do you do that?

612
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:28,150
And now the situation in Australia boils
over and the Austrian say to the 

613
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,610
Germans,
listen,

614
00:38:28,611 --> 00:38:31,040
if we get into a war with Serbia,
Russia is going to attack us.

615
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,410
If Russia attacks us,
where do you stand?

616
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,520
And the,
this is controversial,

617
00:38:36,521 --> 00:38:40,780
but traditionally the Kaiser is supposed
to have told the Austrians to go for it.

618
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,950
Get Serbia had done now.
And some historians.

619
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:46,900
Again,
this is all very controversial.

620
00:38:46,901 --> 00:38:48,680
Everybody has a different opinion.
Um,

621
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:53,790
but basically the idea seems to be that 
the Kaiser believed that if it was done 

622
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:56,950
quickly enough,
the Serbians could be crushed before the

623
00:38:56,951 --> 00:39:01,951
situation spiraled out of control in 
Europe because even as moderately 

624
00:39:01,951 --> 00:39:02,770
intelligent,
we'll put,

625
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:04,420
we'll give them some credit that the 
Kaiser was,

626
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:09,421
he knew that Europe was a powder keg and
the key thing that had to be avoided was

627
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:15,031
this process almost a machine,
the cranking up of a doomsday device 

628
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,650
that everybody who'd actually been 
present when the thinkers who dealt with

629
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:23,320
the Doomsday Device explained what the 
doomsday device did,

630
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,350
understood that once the trigger on this
thing was polled,

631
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,080
it was going to be really hard to turn 
it off.

632
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,440
So if the Austrians could conquer the 
Serbians before the Russians,

633
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,780
you know,
flip the doomsday device switch,

634
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,390
they would all be okay.
Again,

635
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:42,420
a lot of controversy on this because 
this is again another one of those 

636
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,110
places where the war guilt question 
hinges.

637
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,500
Did Germany tell Austria to go crush 
Serbia?

638
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,750
And who cares if the Russians attack 
everybody?

639
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:55,860
But of course the problem wasn't that it
would just involve the Russians 

640
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,760
attacking everybody.
Because of that complex web of alliances

641
00:39:57,761 --> 00:40:00,220
we talked about earlier,
other countries,

642
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:02,110
we're going to get dragged into the 
conflict.

643
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:07,530
This was something that was well 
understood by the intelligent heads of 

644
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:07,870
Europe.
Take for example,

645
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,860
the British prime minister.
During this time period,

646
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,880
Herbert Asquith Asquith wrote a letter,
a private lender that's coming down to 

647
00:40:17,411 --> 00:40:22,411
the history books right after Serbia 
receives the ultimatum from Austria 

648
00:40:22,411 --> 00:40:25,210
that's so important and ask with writes,
quote,

649
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:30,690
Austria has sent a bullying and 
humiliating ultimatum to Serbia who 

650
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:34,801
cannot possibly comply with it and then 
demanded an answer within 48 hours 

651
00:40:34,801 --> 00:40:36,580
failing,
which she will march.

652
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:41,820
This means almost inevitably that Russia
will come to the scene and defensive 

653
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,540
Serbia and in defiance of Austria,
and if so,

654
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:48,750
it's difficult for Germany and France to
refrain from lending a hand to one side 

655
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:52,441
or the other so that we are in 
measurable or imaginable distance of a 

656
00:40:52,441 --> 00:40:53,650
real armageddon.
Happily,

657
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:58,651
there seems to be no reason why we 
should be anything more than spectators 

658
00:40:58,651 --> 00:40:59,140
and quote.
Well,

659
00:40:59,141 --> 00:41:04,141
that turned out obviously to be wishful 
thinking on the British prime ministers 

660
00:41:04,141 --> 00:41:08,041
part,
but historians like Neil Ferguson who 

661
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:08,041
write revisionist works like the pity of
war,

662
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:09,520
have suggested that if the British had 
stayed out,

663
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:12,430
we'd have a better world today for all 
sorts of reasons.

664
00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:14,830
I mean,
he knocks off many of the biggest events

665
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:19,831
of the 20th century.
The most horrible saying this never 

666
00:41:19,831 --> 00:41:19,831
happens.
That never happens.

667
00:41:19,831 --> 00:41:19,930
That never happens.
If Britain stays out of the war,

668
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:25,330
Britain can stay out of the work as they
don't have a hard alliance with anyone.

669
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,870
They're not caught up in that web of 
alliances will not too much.

670
00:41:28,871 --> 00:41:33,871
They have an understanding with France 
and understanding with enough wiggle 

671
00:41:33,871 --> 00:41:37,771
room so that there was a lot of talk in 
Britain about do we or don't we get 

672
00:41:37,771 --> 00:41:41,411
involved in this whole thing?
This whole thing was something that 

673
00:41:41,411 --> 00:41:43,730
hadn't happened in a hundred years in 
Europe,

674
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:48,970
a general European war.
It hadn't happened since Napoleon,

675
00:41:49,671 --> 00:41:54,500
since Waterloo,
and that war was so terrible.

676
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:59,710
Not just that we're the entire 
Napoleonic wars and the wars of the 

677
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,340
French revolution.
That era from like 1789 to 1815,

678
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:06,341
so awful in terms of military 
destruction that a lesson had been 

679
00:42:06,341 --> 00:42:07,640
talked to the,
you know,

680
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,620
crown heads of Europe and the lesson 
was,

681
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,210
was not as much of a game anymore.
It's no longer,

682
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:19,420
you know,
these small private armies that we move 

683
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,491
around our European Chessboard and Oh,
I lost to you so you can have this 

684
00:42:21,491 --> 00:42:22,700
province and then on next time I'll beat
you and I'll take that province back.

685
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:27,700
You know,
nobody was trying to topple over their 

686
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:27,700
regimes.
It was,

687
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,790
if anything,
gentlemanly warfare,

688
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:32,630
if there's ever been such a thing,
it's been called in the history books,

689
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:37,990
limited warfare or restricted warfare.
There was an Italian historian named 

690
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:43,100
Ferraro 1933 who talked about how,
you know,

691
00:42:43,191 --> 00:42:46,700
that era of warfare was the kind of 
warfare where you know,

692
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:48,740
the leaders of countries can actually 
have fun.

693
00:42:48,741 --> 00:42:50,960
Going to war.
War was something you just sort of did,

694
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:55,961
like pheasant hunting,
at least in the minds of some of these 

695
00:42:55,961 --> 00:42:56,300
guys I'm Ferrara writes,
quote,

696
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,960
restricted warfare was one of the 
loftiest achievements of the 18th 

697
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,831
century.
It belongs to a class of hothouse 

698
00:43:05,831 --> 00:43:06,860
plants,
which can only thrive in an aristocratic

699
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:10,670
and qualitative civilization.
We are no longer capable of it.

700
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,880
It's one of the things we have lost as a
result of the French revolution and the 

701
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:22,220
French Revolution was when warfare,
God,

702
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,580
at least in the minds of the Europeans,
have this era,

703
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,470
you know,
really serious,

704
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:30,530
you want a war,
then we're going to go to war.

705
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:35,270
The crown heads of Europe attack France 
after France went all revolutionary,

706
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,480
and you have to understand how much of a
shock that was.

707
00:43:38,481 --> 00:43:41,150
Historian Gwynne Dyer has a great way of
describing it.

708
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:46,151
He says,
to understand the shock of the crown 

709
00:43:46,151 --> 00:43:46,400
heads of Europe when the most royal of 
European countries,

710
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,150
the French were overthrown by leftist 
revolutionaries.

711
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:55,450
He says,
you have to imagine if Maoists toppled 

712
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:56,810
the US government today.
Maoist of course,

713
00:43:56,811 --> 00:44:01,811
being a very hardcore communist group.
Imagine them toppling today's US 

714
00:44:01,811 --> 00:44:02,600
government and beginning to govern.
He goes,

715
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:05,390
that's how the crown heads of Europe 
felt about the French revolution and how

716
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:08,450
destabilizing it was seen.
So inevitably,

717
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,590
the royalty of Europe,
which is almost all of Europe,

718
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,600
clashes with this new republic in France
and coalesces into an alliance and 

719
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:22,360
everybody attacks France and they do so 
with their private mercenary armies and 

720
00:44:22,731 --> 00:44:27,230
they run into the entire French 
population,

721
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:32,620
a people in arms because France started 
by losing.

722
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,640
You have to imagine a state where the 
entire underpinnings of the state have 

723
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,490
been broken down,
including especially the army.

724
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:42,090
And then all I mean pressure rush 
Australia and Great Britain.

725
00:44:42,091 --> 00:44:45,720
All these powers in Europe attack France
at the same time and you're stuck with.

726
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:49,980
I mean like a bit of your army leftover.
The artillery stayed with the people.

727
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:54,981
So the old French artillery was good,
but you've got this mishmash of an army 

728
00:44:54,981 --> 00:44:55,080
with officers.
You don't have any authority.

729
00:44:55,081 --> 00:44:57,900
It's crazy.
And France is about to be defeated.

730
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:02,550
And then as only you know,
totalitarian regimes can do,

731
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:07,970
they basically tell the people of France
that the war is now everything.

732
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:13,250
Our entire focus,
the entire society exists only to win 

733
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:18,111
this war.
The decree of the French national 

734
00:45:18,111 --> 00:45:19,020
convention in Seventeen,
93 said,

735
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:24,021
quote from this moment until that in 
which our enemies shall have been driven

736
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:25,800
from the territory of the republic.

737
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:29,520
All Frenchmen are permanently 
requisition for service in the army's.

738
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:34,790
The young men shall fight.
The married men shall forge weapons and 

739
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:38,301
transport supplies.
The women will make tents and clothes 

740
00:45:38,301 --> 00:45:41,781
and serve in the hospitals.
The public buildings shall be turned 

741
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:44,901
into barracks,
the public squares into munition 

742
00:45:44,901 --> 00:45:45,810
factories.
All firearms have suitable caliber,

743
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:50,811
shall be turned over to the troops.
The interior will be policed with 

744
00:45:50,811 --> 00:45:54,021
shotguns and cold steel.
All saddled horses shall be seized for 

745
00:45:54,021 --> 00:45:58,221
the cavalry.
All draft horses not employed in 

746
00:45:58,221 --> 00:46:00,450
cultivation will draw the artillery and 
supply wagons and quote.

747
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:05,280
In other words,
the entire society was mobilized for the

748
00:46:05,281 --> 00:46:10,281
war effort.
This was not something that the other 

749
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:10,281
countries did.
In fact,

750
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:10,281
most of the royal,
you know,

751
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:15,021
leaders of Europe could think of nothing
more scary than arming and training your

752
00:46:15,121 --> 00:46:17,520
population.
Oftentimes,

753
00:46:17,521 --> 00:46:22,521
they used their professional militaries 
to put down rebellions by their 

754
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:22,560
population.

755
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,410
The last thing they wanted to do was 
give them guns and train them how to use

756
00:46:25,411 --> 00:46:25,670
it,
right.

757
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,890
Train them how to be better.
Street fighters wasn't going to happen,

758
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:31,320
but the French had a different kind of 
society,

759
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,510
one that was supposed to be run by the 
very,

760
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:35,070
you know,
low born people.

761
00:46:35,071 --> 00:46:40,071
Everybody was in this together and you 
combine the willingness to throw human 

762
00:46:40,071 --> 00:46:40,770
life,
you know,

763
00:46:40,771 --> 00:46:43,800
out there on the battlefield in almost 
endless numbers.

764
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,300
You didn't have to pay these people 
either.

765
00:46:45,301 --> 00:46:47,550
You could just say,
I'm sorry you're out of work right now.

766
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,370
You're going to the front and the,
uh,

767
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,440
steal some chickens from some farmer on 
the way this was crazy and all of a 

768
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:59,301
sudden the French were able to expend 
lives on a scale that was unprecedented.

769
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:03,450
And to create armies that were enormous.
I mean,

770
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:08,690
look at Alexander the Great,
probably the greatest conqueror in all 

771
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:08,690
world history.

772
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:13,940
Alexander conquers a very large chunk of
the known world and a decent sized chunk

773
00:47:13,951 --> 00:47:18,951
of the unknown world at the time with an
army that numbered anywhere from 40 to 

774
00:47:19,411 --> 00:47:20,700
90,000
men.

775
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,310
Okay.
And he was obviously a genius in the way

776
00:47:23,311 --> 00:47:27,510
he did it,
but imagine if Alexander could have used

777
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:32,511
a historical xerox machine to duplicate 
that world conquering army so that now 

778
00:47:33,611 --> 00:47:36,480
he's got 2:40
to $90,000,

779
00:47:36,481 --> 00:47:38,620
man armies roughly comparable to each 
other.

780
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:43,240
Now imagine he does it again and then 
duplicate it again.

781
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,610
And then again,
and then again,

782
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,990
you do that enough times to where you 
got one point two,

783
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,480
one point three,
one point 5 million men,

784
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,820
maybe eventually closer to 3 million 
men.

785
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,620
And now you've given Alexander the Great
Twentieth Century Army,

786
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:03,690
a 20th century.
Army is many,

787
00:48:03,691 --> 00:48:08,691
many armies from the past.
The French revolution is when that 

788
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:14,881
really starts.
When you start putting so many troops 

789
00:48:14,881 --> 00:48:18,430
into the field that it doesn't matter 
that there are practically incompetent,

790
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,640
that their lives are wasted,
that they're turned into cannon fodder 

791
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,220
as Napoleon who will inherit this.
You know,

792
00:48:24,221 --> 00:48:29,221
people's army that will conscript every 
man they want to conscript as long as 

793
00:48:29,221 --> 00:48:31,990
they need them.
We'll say troops are born to be killed.

794
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:36,970
And as Napoleon famously said to the 
Austrian diplomat,

795
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:38,080
count,
medtronic,

796
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,380
you cannot stop me.
I spend 30,000

797
00:48:41,381 --> 00:48:42,250
lives a month,

798
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:48,160
if any of the major powers except maybe 
Russia in Europe at this time,

799
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,090
last 30,000
men in a month,

800
00:48:51,091 --> 00:48:54,820
it would be considered quite a blow.
Napoleon lost 30,000

801
00:48:54,821 --> 00:48:56,800
men a month as a matter of course,

802
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:03,580
because he had a new kind of army.
He had a people in arms and in order to 

803
00:49:05,001 --> 00:49:10,001
beat him,
the other countries of Europe had to do 

804
00:49:10,001 --> 00:49:12,900
the same thing as the German field.
Marshal,

805
00:49:12,901 --> 00:49:17,901
blue shirt told the PRUSSIAN government 
after the Russians had been defeated by 

806
00:49:18,051 --> 00:49:20,210
Napoleon,
give me a national army,

807
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:26,080
gave me what he has and when he got it,
you know which the Russian aristocracy 

808
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:30,551
didn't want to do for the same reason 
that the European leaders everywhere 

809
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:33,041
didn't want to do it.
They didn't want to put the people in 

810
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:33,041
arms,
but when they did,

811
00:49:33,041 --> 00:49:36,191
they were able to triple the size of 
blue shirts army and he took that army 

812
00:49:36,191 --> 00:49:39,101
and fought Napoleon with it.
The creation of a nation in arms was the

813
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:44,881
first step in creating the modern war 
machine because now all of a sudden life

814
00:49:44,891 --> 00:49:45,790
was cheap.

815
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:52,870
Not only was life cheap,
but the modern nation state was now deep

816
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:58,451
enough to be able to truly take a punch,
and this is what sets the modern 

817
00:49:59,481 --> 00:50:03,320
militaries off in the modern states,
off from the ones in ancient times.

818
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,460
In ancient times,
very few states could take a punch,

819
00:50:07,461 --> 00:50:08,780
you know,
to use a boxing term.

820
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:13,930
Many of them could dish it out.
When you take a state like the acumen 

821
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:16,800
had Persians,
you know the ones who fought the 

822
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,461
spartans at thermopylae and all that.
The Persians Kodesh out really good 

823
00:50:18,461 --> 00:50:22,151
blows,
but they couldn't take very many good 

824
00:50:22,151 --> 00:50:22,151
blows.
Most nations in the past couldn't.

825
00:50:22,151 --> 00:50:26,530
That's why if you look at a book,
you know the greatest battles in 

826
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:26,530
history.
If it's beyond,

827
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:30,740
you know about 150 ago sometimes the 
great battle is the only battle the wars

828
00:50:30,741 --> 00:50:35,741
are won or lost on one big battle 
because the nation states couldn't take 

829
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:35,741
too many punches.

830
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,850
They couldn't reraise armies.
The state just couldn't support it.

831
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:42,200
Once France turns the entire nation into
the war,

832
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:44,570
effort,
nations can take punches better.

833
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:49,580
And in the past,
I mean the goals and the Chinese could 

834
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,150
take some punches.
The Roman Empire could take punches.

835
00:50:50,151 --> 00:50:52,760
That's what set those nation states in 
the past,

836
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,010
apart from most of their enemies,
right?

837
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:56,750
They,
they had more staying power.

838
00:50:56,810 --> 00:51:01,810
They had modern staying power.
The French Revolution teaches all these 

839
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:05,711
states to have modern staying power.
The only problem with modern staying 

840
00:51:05,711 --> 00:51:07,250
power is that the killing can go on 
longer.

841
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:12,490
In boxing,
they always feel like an early knockout 

842
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:15,251
is more merciful than a long match.
Because in a long match you take a lot 

843
00:51:15,251 --> 00:51:15,260
more punishment.
Well,

844
00:51:15,261 --> 00:51:20,261
in a funny way,
if everything can be decided at one big 

845
00:51:20,261 --> 00:51:20,261
horrific battle,
you know,

846
00:51:20,261 --> 00:51:24,401
at the start of a war that has a lot 
less costly over time than a four or a 

847
00:51:24,401 --> 00:51:28,280
five year long conflict where both sides
grind each other.

848
00:51:28,281 --> 00:51:33,281
Down to the NUB.
The Napoleonic wars created multiple 

849
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:37,850
states in Europe capable of fighting 
until they were ground down to the NUB,

850
00:51:38,210 --> 00:51:40,460
which meant a lot more damage and 
destruction.

851
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:42,230
Before these wars came to a halt.

852
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:49,330
The modern nation state provided the 
support that the militaries that 

853
00:51:50,271 --> 00:51:54,950
involved entire peoples in arms needed 
to keep the struggle going,

854
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:57,200
you know,
for long periods of time,

855
00:51:57,201 --> 00:52:01,130
one half of the equation necessary to 
create the modern war machines.

856
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:06,790
As military historian Gwynne dyer rights
right after he talks about the human 

857
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:06,790
costs of these,
you know,

858
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,090
Long Napoleonic wars.
He says,

859
00:52:08,091 --> 00:52:13,091
quote,
almost as important is the fact that 

860
00:52:13,091 --> 00:52:14,720
European society did not break down 
under the strain.

861
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:18,500
There was hardship,
but no starvation and the warring powers

862
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:23,270
were able to keep at it and keep their 
people at it year after year with no end

863
00:52:23,271 --> 00:52:28,271
in sight.
The European states had developed the 

864
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:30,881
wealth,
the organizational techniques and the 

865
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:33,491
methods of motivation needed to fight 
mass wars with a degree of popular 

866
00:52:33,491 --> 00:52:37,730
participation that no other civilized 
society had ever even approached.

867
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:41,840
All that was lacking.
He writes to transform mass warfare into

868
00:52:41,841 --> 00:52:46,841
total war was the technology,
but the industrial revolution was 

869
00:52:46,841 --> 00:52:50,981
already almost a generation old and 18,
14 and soon it would begin to fill the 

870
00:52:50,981 --> 00:52:55,871
last remaining gap and to quote what was
missing to make this new deadly machine 

871
00:52:58,191 --> 00:53:03,020
that the Napoleonic wars and the French 
revolution created was the technology to

872
00:53:03,021 --> 00:53:08,021
increase the deadliness by exponential 
amounts and that was already something 

873
00:53:08,781 --> 00:53:09,470
that was happening.

874
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:14,470
The 18 hundreds are an era in military 
history where the killing power of 

875
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:18,521
machines skyrockets and machines have 
been an important part of battlefields 

876
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,240
since before.
There were cities in human societies to 

877
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,070
field mass armies at all.
Think of the bow and Arrow,

878
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:31,110
that's a neolithic weapon.
That's a stone age machine that made man

879
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:35,760
a more efficient killer both in hunting 
but on the battlefield as well.

880
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:39,510
By the time the 18 hundreds roll around 
the machines,

881
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:41,430
killing power skyrockets,

882
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,760
but because there is no major war 
involving all the great powers between 

883
00:53:49,281 --> 00:53:54,281
Napoleon and the first world war,
the actual demonstration of how this 

884
00:53:54,381 --> 00:53:59,381
stuff can be used is lacking and the 
military powers of the world.

885
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:05,590
Try to examine the conflicts that do 
happen to see if they can learn any 

886
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:08,240
lessons about what the next war is 
likely to be like.

887
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:11,780
There were European observers,
for example,

888
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:14,120
at the American civil war,
to try to see,

889
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,920
you know,
what you could learn from that.

890
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:22,060
The Crimean war breaks out in the 18 
fifties between Russia and Britain and 

891
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:26,111
France.
There's a war obviously between the 

892
00:54:26,111 --> 00:54:29,290
United States and Spain that involve 
Cuba and the Philippines in,

893
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:34,291
uh,
right around the turn of the century 

894
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:34,360
going into the 19 hundreds,
probably most importantly,

895
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:39,570
there's a war between Japan and Russia 
in 1905 where some of the use of these,

896
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:45,920
you know,
new weapons that when fused together 

897
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,740
create the modern war machine where some
of that was observable.

898
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:54,600
The one thing that seems to be the key 
element as far as European planners can 

899
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:59,481
figure it out though,
is something that Harkens back to a 

900
00:54:59,481 --> 00:55:02,971
phrase from a confederate general in the
US civil war who said that the key to 

901
00:55:02,971 --> 00:55:07,210
warfare was to get their firstest with 
the mostest.

902
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:12,990
And the idea now of these mass armies 
that you're a peg created was that you 

903
00:55:14,201 --> 00:55:19,201
needed to be able to raise them and get 
them to the battlefield before the other

904
00:55:19,961 --> 00:55:24,961
side beat you to it.
The timetable for mobilization becomes a

905
00:55:26,801 --> 00:55:31,801
force that none of the major European 
powers seem to be anything but a slave 

906
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:37,050
to once the assassin's bullet in 
Sarajevo cuts down the Austrian 

907
00:55:37,151 --> 00:55:37,840
archduke.

908
00:55:40,030 --> 00:55:42,250
When the archduke is killed by 
principal,

909
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:46,300
he does the equivalent of pulling a pan 
on a hand grenade.

910
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:52,290
Imagine trying to hold negotiations to 
ward off an explosion with a guy who's 

911
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:55,150
already pulled the pin on the grenade,
right?

912
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:58,090
You have a limited amount of time to 
convince them of anything.

913
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:03,330
Winston Churchill,
during his life had famously said that 

914
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:05,350
jaw jaw was better than war.
War,

915
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,450
meaning negotiation is always better 
than war,

916
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:11,260
but at the person's already pulled the 
pin on the hand grenade.

917
00:56:11,261 --> 00:56:15,280
You have a very short window of 
opportunity to avoid the inevitable.

918
00:56:15,281 --> 00:56:18,790
And that's where Europe finds itself.
After the archduke is murdered.

919
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:21,810
Everybody's worried about the same thing
too.

920
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:26,811
There's an old phrase,
the peace movement used to use in the 

921
00:56:26,811 --> 00:56:27,940
late 19 sixties,
early 19 seventies where they would say,

922
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:32,880
what if they gave a war and nobody came?
Well,

923
00:56:32,881 --> 00:56:35,950
the military planners in Europe at this 
time period or worried about something a

924
00:56:35,951 --> 00:56:40,951
little bit different.
What if war breaks out and on the days 

925
00:56:40,951 --> 00:56:44,080
that hostilities commence,
only one side's got their army there.

926
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:50,560
I mean,
if it takes you 30 days to get your 

927
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,080
reservists in uniform to the mustering 
point,

928
00:56:52,081 --> 00:56:54,020
into the battlefield before they're 
ready to fight,

929
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:59,770
how big of a deal is it if it only takes
your opponent 15 days to do the same 

930
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:04,070
thing?
This puts a huge crunch,

931
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:09,540
you know,
timewise on everybody in this story and 

932
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:10,460
constrains the ability to negotiate your
way out of this situation.

933
00:57:10,461 --> 00:57:12,170
Everybody feels like,
okay,

934
00:57:12,171 --> 00:57:14,630
the first person that flips the 
mobilization switch,

935
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:17,150
we all go because nobody wants to fall 
behind.

936
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:21,440
The Germans have constrained themselves 
even more timewise by the way,

937
00:57:21,441 --> 00:57:26,441
that they have found a solution to their
terrible dilemma of how do you fight a 

938
00:57:26,751 --> 00:57:29,090
two front war?
You know,

939
00:57:29,091 --> 00:57:32,090
once you violate bismark's dictum of,
you know,

940
00:57:32,091 --> 00:57:37,091
keep the Russians on your side and then 
the Russians and the French ally with 

941
00:57:37,091 --> 00:57:40,391
each other and war breaks out.
You're going to be fighting the French 

942
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:40,391
and the West and the Russians and the 
east at the same time

943
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:47,320
and in the intervening decades,
the fantastic German general staff had 

944
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,530
figured out a way to not just survive 
that situation but to win that war.

945
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:57,190
But it involved exquisite timing which 
further constrained the amount of 

946
00:57:58,131 --> 00:58:00,770
negotiation room you had before the 
grenade went off.

947
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:06,130
The timing involved taking advantage of 
the fact that everyone thought the 

948
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:07,340
Russians were going to take forever to 
mobilize.

949
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:12,140
The Russians were seen as a giant,
somewhat clumsy colossus,

950
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:15,530
less organized than the Germans and the 
French and people like that.

951
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,800
And so by the time the Russians could 
get their act together and get their 

952
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,530
monstrous armies in the field ready to 
fight,

953
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:24,650
Germany already would have defeated 
France.

954
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:29,870
Their entire plan for action involved 
throwing almost all their weight against

955
00:58:29,871 --> 00:58:34,871
the French immediately and then turning 
after French forces were defeated and 

956
00:58:34,871 --> 00:58:37,520
throwing those forces against the now 
ready to fight Russians,

957
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,620
but this did two things,
so the Germans one,

958
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,650
it meant the Russians could have no 
advanced time mobilizing.

959
00:58:45,651 --> 00:58:50,651
You couldn't let them mobilize for three
or four days while you waited to 

960
00:58:50,651 --> 00:58:51,770
negotiate,
putting the pin back in the grenade.

961
00:58:51,771 --> 00:58:56,771
You didn't have that kind of time.
You were going to screw up your entire 

962
00:58:56,771 --> 00:58:56,780
plan for winning the war.
If you did that.

963
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:00,200
The other thing that it meant is that if
you went to war with Russia,

964
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:05,710
you had to attack France.
You had to assume that the French would 

965
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:09,401
come in at some time and the only thing 
you had a plan to deal with was to 

966
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:10,310
attack the French first.
So if you go into war with Russia,

967
00:59:10,311 --> 00:59:12,500
you get to attack France as part of the 
bargain,

968
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:16,900
but it was even more of a concern than 
that.

969
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,710
It involved attacking countries besides 
France.

970
00:59:20,711 --> 00:59:21,830
Countries had no

971
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,070
disagreement with it.
All neutral countries.

972
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:30,820
That just happened to be in the way the 
Germans had come up with a plan to deal 

973
00:59:32,021 --> 00:59:37,021
with their encirclement problem,
but it involved launching essentially a 

974
00:59:37,021 --> 00:59:42,001
world war in their own defense.
The other thing that prince did was 

975
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:48,530
provide an opportunity for a lot of 
these leaders who thought war was coming

976
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:53,030
anyway to decide that now was better 
than later,

977
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,610
and this is another interesting side of 
the conflict,

978
00:59:55,611 --> 00:59:59,760
but if you're part of these many 
military staffs that are absolutely sure

979
00:59:59,761 --> 01:00:04,040
wars coming and you know you can read 
accounts from every major military,

980
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:09,041
the time period we're numbers of their 
military planners thought war was 

981
01:00:09,041 --> 01:00:09,570
inevitable.
The question is,

982
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:14,590
if it's going to be inevitable,
is it better to fight it now than 

983
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:14,590
lighter?

984
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:19,640
The Germans were under the impression 
that the Russians were on their way to 

985
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,911
superpower status,
which if you look at what happened in 

986
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,460
the 20th century,
is exactly how it turned out.

987
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:29,090
The Germans felt that by 1917,
that was going to be a reality that 

988
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:30,540
Russians were completing major military 
reforms,

989
01:00:30,541 --> 01:00:35,541
major transportation reforms.
They were taking advantage of huge 

990
01:00:35,541 --> 01:00:38,571
French bank loans to do this stuff.
The Germans figured if more comes in 

991
01:00:38,571 --> 01:00:42,381
three years,
we're going to be in a much worse 

992
01:00:42,381 --> 01:00:42,381
situation than we are now,
so if it's here,

993
01:00:42,381 --> 01:00:42,600
we might as well do it.
Now.

994
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:44,550
We have an advantage now.
We won't have later.

995
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:50,580
The French felt similarly about the 
Germans.

996
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:55,630
The Germans felt about the Russians.
They were looking at the German birth 

997
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:55,760
rate and just going,
we're going to be swamped.

998
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:58,410
They were looking at the growth in 
industry.

999
01:00:58,411 --> 01:01:03,411
I mean the Germans were on a tear,
so if war came in five or six or seven 

1000
01:01:04,711 --> 01:01:09,711
years,
the French are just going to be worse 

1001
01:01:09,711 --> 01:01:11,871
off.
So they figured the same thing if was 

1002
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:16,420
going to come,
let it come now and amidst these 

1003
01:01:18,061 --> 01:01:22,440
interesting conflicts of interest in 
worries about timing and all this stuff,

1004
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:28,170
the world sees where it's heading and 
tries to pull back from the brink,

1005
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,800
but instead of having,
you know,

1006
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:34,140
the greatest statesman Europe can 
produce during this time period.

1007
01:01:34,141 --> 01:01:39,141
Some of these countries are saddled with
people who are like millstones around 

1008
01:01:39,751 --> 01:01:40,860
the neck of peace.

1009
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:46,960
People like Kaiser Wilhelm,
the second the emperor of Germany and 

1010
01:01:49,811 --> 01:01:54,811
leadership is such an interesting side 
of this conflict because I firmly 

1011
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:59,521
believe,
had you had a guy of Otto von Bismarck 

1012
01:01:59,521 --> 01:02:03,750
caliber in a position of authority in 
Germany when the first world war is on 

1013
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:08,431
the verge of happening,
that they could put the pin back in the 

1014
01:02:08,431 --> 01:02:08,431
grenade.
You know,

1015
01:02:08,431 --> 01:02:09,550
the governor,
Lowe Prinsep,

1016
01:02:09,551 --> 01:02:14,551
metaphorically pulled in Sarajevo.
I think it could have been done and all 

1017
01:02:14,551 --> 01:02:18,241
it would have required would have been 
some real diplomatic quality.

1018
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:20,250
Brilliance

1019
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,110
would have been great,
but I don't even think you needed that.

1020
01:02:22,111 --> 01:02:27,111
Just some.
Some high quality workmanship which the 

1021
01:02:27,111 --> 01:02:28,950
Germans had produced time and again,
the problem was in this time period,

1022
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:34,230
they are stuck with a ruler who could 
not have gotten the job if marriage had 

1023
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:37,080
been one of the requirements,
you know,

1024
01:02:37,081 --> 01:02:40,140
of having it handed to you.
Kaiser Wilhelm.

1025
01:02:40,141 --> 01:02:45,030
The second was not a great leader.
He represents the,

1026
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,620
you know,
most wonderful example.

1027
01:02:46,621 --> 01:02:51,621
You can easily think of of what a roll 
of the dice hereditary monarchy is and 

1028
01:02:53,011 --> 01:02:58,011
how sometimes you get a great role and 
you end up with a gifted ruler and then 

1029
01:02:58,011 --> 01:03:00,510
it almost seems wonderful that they've 
got so much power in their hands,

1030
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:05,511
right,
because if someone really knows what to 

1031
01:03:05,511 --> 01:03:05,511
do with it and does good things with it,
you kind of say to yourself,

1032
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:07,350
I'm glad they had the power to do those 
good things,

1033
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:09,780
but that's a bit of a roll of the dice,
isn't it?

1034
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:14,780
As often as you get one of those people,
you get somebody who's evil or cruel or 

1035
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:18,741
insane.
Some people throughout history have 

1036
01:03:18,741 --> 01:03:20,310
rolled very badly on the dice far too 
many times,

1037
01:03:20,311 --> 01:03:22,170
but it creates good hardcore history 
work,

1038
01:03:22,171 --> 01:03:22,830
you know,
for us.

1039
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:26,550
I mean the ancient elamites used to roll
whatever the number is that comes up.

1040
01:03:26,551 --> 01:03:31,551
That means you get yet another insane 
ruler in your dynasties made for fun 

1041
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,420
reading,
but I wouldn't have wanted to live under

1042
01:03:33,421 --> 01:03:36,600
it in Germany,
this current leader,

1043
01:03:36,601 --> 01:03:40,200
this current Kaiser Kaiser,
just like czar in Russia where they have

1044
01:03:40,201 --> 01:03:44,970
an autocratic king guy to both of those 
stem from the word Caesar,

1045
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:48,240
which right there in the 20th century.
Sounds anachronistic,

1046
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:53,241
doesn't it?
And that's part of this old world that 

1047
01:03:53,241 --> 01:03:56,091
had existed for forever mean King.
An emperor doesn't sound anachronistic 

1048
01:03:56,091 --> 01:03:59,730
at anytime in history before 1914.
Going back to like Mesopotamia does,

1049
01:03:59,731 --> 01:04:01,350
it just sounds weird.

1050
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:05,100
In the 20th century,
shows you how old this world is.

1051
01:04:05,101 --> 01:04:10,101
That is marching into the 20th century.
Three of the major powers in this 

1052
01:04:10,101 --> 01:04:12,330
conflict are ruled by emperors,
kings or czars.

1053
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,650
Now they don't have total power.
Well,

1054
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:20,100
the are almost does really a.
The Kaiser's had his chipped away over a

1055
01:04:20,101 --> 01:04:22,440
couple generations.
He has to share some power with a German

1056
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:26,430
legislature which has political parties 
and they handle budgets and taxation,

1057
01:04:26,431 --> 01:04:31,431
but the Kaiser's still has a ton of 
power over war and foreign policy and 

1058
01:04:31,431 --> 01:04:33,900
political appointments and all that,
and he's just this below average guy.

1059
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:38,400
The funny part about the Kaiser is that 
the best thing that ever happened to his

1060
01:04:38,401 --> 01:04:43,401
reputation was out off Hitler because 
when you look at the propaganda and you 

1061
01:04:43,401 --> 01:04:47,520
read the stuff written about the kaiser 
before Hitler comes along and the Kaiser

1062
01:04:47,521 --> 01:04:50,670
is treated as this evil character,
malevolent,

1063
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:56,080
you know,
this militaristic want to take over the 

1064
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,810
world blood falling off of the bay and 
at uc in the political cartoons.

1065
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:03,740
And now the attitude that people have 
towards him is that he's almost silly or

1066
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:06,410
that he's full of.
You know,

1067
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,960
he's just wracked with inferiority 
complexes.

1068
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:13,250
He's almost to be pitied.
He's a little mentally doll but,

1069
01:05:13,251 --> 01:05:15,780
but there isn't that malevolent evil 
sort of thing.

1070
01:05:15,781 --> 01:05:20,781
And I think part of the reason why is 
when you have Hitler to compare someone 

1071
01:05:20,781 --> 01:05:22,710
to all of a sudden you see that the 
kaiser was just sort of a.

1072
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:25,960
You know,
marginally bad role on the monarchy,

1073
01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:30,961
dice for what it's worth.
He was tied into all the other great 

1074
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:33,940
monarchies in Europe.
One of the funny twists in the story,

1075
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:39,180
and it actually provides something of 
importance because at in Europe at this 

1076
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:43,831
time,
the royal families had relatives of 

1077
01:05:43,831 --> 01:05:44,410
other royal families in Europe,
in their families,

1078
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,140
and these families still communicated 
with each other,

1079
01:05:47,141 --> 01:05:52,141
which provides like a diplomatic back 
channel where these rulers can actually 

1080
01:05:52,141 --> 01:05:56,970
sidestep traditional diplomacy and just 
write the family member that rules the 

1081
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:57,040
other country.

1082
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,050
For example,
Queen Victoria,

1083
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:01,690
who may be the most famous queen in 
British history,

1084
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:06,691
maybe the most important ruled forever 
presided over Britain during the height 

1085
01:06:06,691 --> 01:06:11,161
of Britain's power when she's 
controlling most of the world and the 

1086
01:06:11,161 --> 01:06:12,220
Sun proverbially never set on the 
British empire.

1087
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:15,910
Queen Victoria's grandchildren are in.
I mean,

1088
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:17,560
well,
Kaiser Wilhelm's,

1089
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:21,610
one of them,
he's Queen Victoria's grandchild.

1090
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:24,310
He's the first cousin of the King of 
England.

1091
01:06:24,311 --> 01:06:25,420
King George,
right.

1092
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:31,200
Not just that,
but the czar of Russia is married to 

1093
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:35,410
another Queen Victoria grandchildren.
So the czar is her son in law.

1094
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:40,590
It's also wilhelm's cousin and when he 
gets upset or he wants to talk to the 

1095
01:06:40,811 --> 01:06:43,130
Russians about something,
he will often sit down and pen.

1096
01:06:43,131 --> 01:06:47,530
A quick note to cousin Nikki,
that would be Tsar Nicholas the second.

1097
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:53,970
Now the czar in Russia is another 
average to low average role on the 

1098
01:06:54,311 --> 01:06:58,000
monarchy dice.
It's perhaps telling and some historians

1099
01:06:58,001 --> 01:07:03,001
have made it out to be that you end up 
with such mediocre leadership in such 

1100
01:07:03,001 --> 01:07:03,880
powerful countries during this time 
period.

1101
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:09,480
It might account for why you know,
these international incidents which 

1102
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:13,741
could have led to war previously didn't,
but now are because the leadership 

1103
01:07:13,741 --> 01:07:15,130
sucks.
I mean in terms of what you could expect

1104
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:17,200
that these people were merit based 
leaders.

1105
01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:19,570
You know,
you can say what you want about a stolen

1106
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:23,800
or Hitler or even a Mussolini who's been
portrayed again in the west,

1107
01:07:23,801 --> 01:07:28,801
like some sort of clown,
but all of those people were formidable 

1108
01:07:28,801 --> 01:07:30,880
individuals who rose through the ranks 
at some level.

1109
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:32,860
I mean,
same thing with American politicians.

1110
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,550
I mean a guy like Franklin Roosevelt,
you can say what you want about them,

1111
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:40,551
but that's a formidable human being with
qualities that allowed them to sort of 

1112
01:07:40,551 --> 01:07:42,190
rise to the top.
That requires a merit based,

1113
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:47,400
something being born into the 
hohenzollern family as the oldest son 

1114
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,660
doesn't require anything.
That's the luck of the draw.

1115
01:07:50,770 --> 01:07:53,110
If the job of Kaiser had been merit 
based,

1116
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:55,630
Kaiser Wilhelm,
the second wouldn't have gotten anywhere

1117
01:07:55,631 --> 01:08:00,631
near it.
And yet he's the guy most responsible 

1118
01:08:00,631 --> 01:08:04,350
for putting the pin back in the grenade.
If war is going to be avoided here and 

1119
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:04,350
you know,
he famously said,

1120
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:06,400
after he sacked bismarck and then sacked
another guy,

1121
01:08:06,401 --> 01:08:08,170
he said,
I am my own chancellor,

1122
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,660
meaning I'm,
I'm going to run all this myself,

1123
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:16,290
but what do you do when not only are 
they sub par in intelligence and 

1124
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:20,351
brilliance and all that,
but because they're subpar and if they 

1125
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,380
can't see that there's sub part and they
don't even take advice.

1126
01:08:21,381 --> 01:08:22,190
Well,
I mean,

1127
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:27,191
at one point in the story,
the Kaiser will ask one of his military 

1128
01:08:27,191 --> 01:08:28,250
leaders to do something that is 
ridiculous,

1129
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:29,960
stupid,
lose the war,

1130
01:08:29,961 --> 01:08:34,961
stupid.
And the military leader will say it 

1131
01:08:34,961 --> 01:08:37,271
cannot be done,
and the Kaiser will embarrass him and 

1132
01:08:37,271 --> 01:08:38,400
say something to the effect of your 
uncle who was also a field marshal would

1133
01:08:38,401 --> 01:08:39,590
have given me a different answer.

1134
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:44,770
In other words,
he would have done what I wanted him to 

1135
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:44,770
do,
even if it was stupid.

1136
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:46,880
The Kaiser,
just to show you how it is too.

1137
01:08:46,881 --> 01:08:49,340
So you understand royalty and you 
remember in your head you go,

1138
01:08:49,341 --> 01:08:50,290
oh yeah,
that's what royalties.

1139
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,790
Like this same military leader I just 
quoted,

1140
01:08:52,791 --> 01:08:57,350
a guy named von Moltke will have to 
change the way that the German war games

1141
01:08:57,351 --> 01:09:02,351
system works before the first world war 
and he will have to put his foot down 

1142
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:06,580
and take a career risking move and tell 
the kaiser that no longer can they keep 

1143
01:09:06,801 --> 01:09:11,801
up with the tradition that whatever side
the kaiser is commanding in the German 

1144
01:09:11,801 --> 01:09:14,540
national war games has to win.
Think about that for a second.

1145
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:18,020
Before Field Marshal von Moltke puts his
foot down,

1146
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,320
whatever side that Kaiser is commanding 
in these war games,

1147
01:09:21,321 --> 01:09:24,800
these national maneuvers of national 
security importance,

1148
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:28,700
whatever side of the Kaisers,
commanding wins automatically.

1149
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:34,220
Come on folks.
That's goofy and the Kaiser is a little 

1150
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:37,901
goofy.
He's got this one arm that was damaged 

1151
01:09:37,901 --> 01:09:39,080
during his birth,
which was withered and had no strength.

1152
01:09:39,081 --> 01:09:40,850
He couldn't cut his own food,
for example,

1153
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:44,870
which is so embarrassing to a guy who's 
already got an inferiority complex.

1154
01:09:45,140 --> 01:09:50,140
He goes to England to spend time with 
his cousins and they don't really care 

1155
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:53,621
for him too much.
The British royal family has kind of 

1156
01:09:53,621 --> 01:09:54,800
turned off by William and all William 
wants is kind of their love and approval

1157
01:09:54,801 --> 01:09:59,801
and to be like them.
And what's funny is in this sort of 

1158
01:09:59,801 --> 01:10:02,711
weird,
I'm almost like tragic playwright kind 

1159
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:07,751
of way.
The Kaiser sort of embodies the 

1160
01:10:07,751 --> 01:10:08,990
inferiority complex that his country has
at this time too.

1161
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:14,260
There are new country on the stage and 
they think they're being treated like 

1162
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:14,260
trash.
They're mad,

1163
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:19,070
they're chauvinistically.
That's how the British and the French 

1164
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:19,070
and those people see them as just these 
upstart.

1165
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:20,960
You know,
push their weight around kind of people,

1166
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:26,440
but as many historians have pointed out,
there's no nation in the world that 

1167
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:26,600
that's up and coming that doesn't start 
to act like it.

1168
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:31,900
And when they do,
the nations that already have it all 

1169
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:31,900
don't like it.
I mean,

1170
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:35,591
how do,
how does the United States kind of feel 

1171
01:10:35,591 --> 01:10:35,591
about China today sort of elbowing its 
way into the,

1172
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:37,880
you know,
power structure here.

1173
01:10:37,881 --> 01:10:39,650
I mean,
we all understand they deserve it.

1174
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:42,020
You look at their economics,
you look at all the signs,

1175
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:42,410
they,
they're,

1176
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:47,450
they're up and coming,
but nobody necessarily feels like that 

1177
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:50,591
person pushing their way in to get their
own space is anything other than a bit 

1178
01:10:50,591 --> 01:10:53,150
of an upstart during this time period.
The United States plays a similar role.

1179
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:56,240
This sort of elbowing their way into the
world power,

1180
01:10:56,241 --> 01:10:58,490
whether the people that are already 
there like it or not,

1181
01:10:58,491 --> 01:10:59,180
make some room.

1182
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:01,580
Here we come.
That's how the German empire was.

1183
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:06,730
There was a feeling of inferiority and 
Kaiser Wilhelm held that sort of 

1184
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:10,390
attitude in spades.
But if you read the stuff at the time 

1185
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:14,501
she's portrayed as this militarist and 
that is the term that is most often for 

1186
01:11:14,501 --> 01:11:17,280
this German empire that will be blamed 
for everything that's happening here.

1187
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:19,260
Okay.
Militarism,

1188
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,490
the entire latter part of the 18 
hundreds.

1189
01:11:23,491 --> 01:11:28,491
People focused on militarism and the 
building of these amazingly 

1190
01:11:28,491 --> 01:11:29,970
technologically deadly armaments and the
race for power.

1191
01:11:29,971 --> 01:11:32,130
I mean,
it just seemed like the world was arming

1192
01:11:32,131 --> 01:11:33,990
itself to the teeth and it was just 
going to explode.

1193
01:11:33,991 --> 01:11:38,991
And it was these militarists who were 
responsible and people who look at Nazi 

1194
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:40,350
Germany and who are,
um,

1195
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:45,210
I know people who are enthralled by the 
Wehrmacht and the precision marching and

1196
01:11:45,211 --> 01:11:48,270
the uniforms in this whole sort of 
militaristic,

1197
01:11:48,271 --> 01:11:50,310
fascist attitude that the Nazis 
portrayed.

1198
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,980
And I always try to tell them that the 
Nazis didn't invent this,

1199
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:58,430
that the Nazis were revitalizing regular
German Marshall Attitudes.

1200
01:11:59,491 --> 01:12:00,810
That's the niceties.
Militarism.

1201
01:12:00,811 --> 01:12:01,980
If you don't like it,
it's Marshall.

1202
01:12:01,981 --> 01:12:06,981
If you do like it,
that's what Hitler and his cabal we're 

1203
01:12:06,981 --> 01:12:10,461
doing is bringing back traditional 
Prussian Marshall Practices that goose 

1204
01:12:11,401 --> 01:12:12,750
stepping,
robotic,

1205
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:16,800
unbelievably efficient,
precision drilling and all that.

1206
01:12:16,801 --> 01:12:21,600
Those are qualities that go back to 
Frederick the great and it freaked out a

1207
01:12:21,601 --> 01:12:26,601
lot.
A lot of the countries in Europe looked 

1208
01:12:26,601 --> 01:12:26,601
at this and they just,
they look dangerous.

1209
01:12:26,601 --> 01:12:26,730
They look mean.
They looked chauvinistically.

1210
01:12:26,731 --> 01:12:31,731
They looked like they wanted to take 
over your country and then they were 

1211
01:12:31,731 --> 01:12:31,731
building this giant navy.
Now all of a sudden,

1212
01:12:31,731 --> 01:12:36,381
out of nowhere challenging Britain,
because the Kaiser had read that same 

1213
01:12:36,381 --> 01:12:39,921
book that Theodore Roosevelt read.
Did anybody do more damage than Alfred?

1214
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:45,220
They are may hand when he decides to 
write a book on naval history because 

1215
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:45,220
the Kaiser,
like Roosevelt,

1216
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:46,230
Reddit,
was enthralled with it,

1217
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:47,250
made all his,
you know,

1218
01:12:47,251 --> 01:12:48,060
ab rules,
read it,

1219
01:12:48,061 --> 01:12:53,061
and then decided he was going to build 
this fleet to compete with Britain so 

1220
01:12:53,061 --> 01:12:53,061
that they wouldn't take him for granted.

1221
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Fascinating character.
A perfect example though of what can 

1222
01:12:59,000 --> 01:12:59,760
happen with the role of the monarchy 
dice.

1223
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:01,500
Now,
of course,

1224
01:13:01,501 --> 01:13:06,501
all the governments in Europe that 
matter are not all monarchies and 

1225
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:11,930
autocratic governments.
There are the famous governments of 

1226
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:11,930
France and Britain,
for example,

1227
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:12,180
Francis,
a republic.

1228
01:13:12,181 --> 01:13:17,181
Again,
by this time having tried out royalty 

1229
01:13:17,181 --> 01:13:19,540
again after Napoleon decided that they 
liked the republic idea better and there

1230
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:23,250
are republic and Britain might as well 
be by this time period.

1231
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:25,650
They still have the king and the royalty
and all that,

1232
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:29,040
but they don't have any power anymore 
than they were during this time period.

1233
01:13:29,041 --> 01:13:34,041
The way the royal family is now,
maybe more gravitas and maybe more able 

1234
01:13:34,291 --> 01:13:39,291
to shift public opinion one way or the 
other than the more cynical generation 

1235
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:43,371
today looks at the current royal family,
but at the time that's about the extent 

1236
01:13:43,371 --> 01:13:43,710
of their political authority.

1237
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:47,010
Parliament,
the legislature of Britain has the power

1238
01:13:47,011 --> 01:13:52,011
then like they have the power now,
but that creates a dynamic where the 

1239
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:53,220
French and the British have to worry 
about things that,

1240
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:58,910
you know,
the countries on the other side of the 

1241
01:13:58,910 --> 01:13:58,910
ledger or Russia don't have to worry 
about.

1242
01:13:58,910 --> 01:13:59,640
They have to worry about the political 
situation.

1243
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:01,950
They have to worry about their political
opponents.

1244
01:14:02,300 --> 01:14:07,300
You know,
using the war situation as a political 

1245
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:11,000
issue in Great Britain.
There's quite a bit of division over 

1246
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,451
this whole thing and during this time 
period between when the archduke is 

1247
01:14:14,451 --> 01:14:15,910
assassinated,
which happens on June 28th,

1248
01:14:15,911 --> 01:14:18,440
1914,
and when the Austria,

1249
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:20,980
Hungarian government issues that famous 
ultimatum,

1250
01:14:20,981 --> 01:14:24,040
the list of demands to Serbia,
which happens on July 23rd,

1251
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:25,930
there's a big dead zone in there.

1252
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:28,170
No,
it's not really a dead zone.

1253
01:14:28,171 --> 01:14:30,390
If you were reading the morning papers 
every morning in that period,

1254
01:14:30,391 --> 01:14:33,990
there'll be war scares and comments here
and there'd be something new everyday to

1255
01:14:33,991 --> 01:14:37,080
keep you focused on the crisis.
But historically speaking,

1256
01:14:37,081 --> 01:14:39,750
not much happens.
What was going on was behind the scenes,

1257
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:44,960
a ton of diplomacy and one of the main 
avenues of diplomacy or the French 

1258
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:47,160
trying to get the British,
you know,

1259
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:52,200
into some sort of hard agreement for 
what they're going to do if this war 

1260
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:55,761
breaks out in five minutes because they 
don't have a hard agreement with the 

1261
01:14:55,761 --> 01:14:58,461
British.
They sort of have a soft agreement 

1262
01:14:58,461 --> 01:14:59,160
instead of a signed on the dotted line 
contract.

1263
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:04,310
They have a handshake deal and they're 
starting to get a little bit worried 

1264
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:06,981
about the handshake deal and they're 
getting worried that even if the 

1265
01:15:06,981 --> 01:15:10,410
government in charge in London right now
will come through on the handshake deal,

1266
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:13,410
who's to say they're going to be able to
keep political power.

1267
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:15,870
Their opponents could use this war 
issue,

1268
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:17,250
you know,
to topple the government,

1269
01:15:17,251 --> 01:15:19,010
take control of the government,
and then say to France,

1270
01:15:19,170 --> 01:15:20,670
we only have a handshake deal.
I'm sorry,

1271
01:15:20,671 --> 01:15:24,060
the new government will not comply with 
a handshake deal.

1272
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:25,650
Sorry,
we're not getting involved in this war.

1273
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:30,651
We're neutral.
We have this splendid isolation and the 

1274
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:30,651
navy will protect us because remember,
folks,

1275
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:35,121
look at a map of Great Britain.
They have a giant moat around their 

1276
01:15:35,121 --> 01:15:36,270
country and the greatest navy in the 
world to protect it.

1277
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:38,970
They have the option of staying out of 
this thing if they want to.

1278
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:44,660
The French don't have that luxury.
They run the invasion list there on the 

1279
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:48,441
dinner menu for imperial Germany and 
they're looking for people to provide 

1280
01:15:48,441 --> 01:15:49,920
some help.
They've got the Russians,

1281
01:15:49,921 --> 01:15:54,921
but the Russians are a long way away,
but not being on the dinner menu for the

1282
01:15:56,551 --> 01:16:01,551
imperial German military meant that the 
British situation was fundamentally 

1283
01:16:01,551 --> 01:16:01,890
different.

1284
01:16:03,730 --> 01:16:08,710
They couldn't see a real positive 
outcome for them if they get involved in

1285
01:16:08,711 --> 01:16:13,711
this whole affair.
I mean there are things the French can 

1286
01:16:13,711 --> 01:16:13,711
gain.
They've got a couple of last territories

1287
01:16:13,711 --> 01:16:15,880
they lost to Germany and the war of 18,
78 and 71.

1288
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:19,210
They'd like to get those back in a best 
case scenario,

1289
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:20,710
you know,
if this conflict breaks out,

1290
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:25,890
they will get them back.
The British don't have anything that 

1291
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:25,990
wonderfully positive to look forward to.
Yes,

1292
01:16:25,991 --> 01:16:28,360
they might alleviate the threat of this 
German fleet,

1293
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:33,780
but by 1912 it was already felt that the
British had proven that the Germans 

1294
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:36,190
could not compete with them in the 
building of ships,

1295
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:39,460
not if they wanted to have a great land 
army at the same time.

1296
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,430
And so that's kind of out of the way by 
this point.

1297
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:47,820
So no big gain there.
And maybe you protect France from 

1298
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:51,721
falling because if France falls,
you get the situation you had in the 

1299
01:16:51,721 --> 01:16:54,481
Second World War in 1940,
we're all of a sudden you have the 

1300
01:16:54,481 --> 01:16:57,721
German staring across the English 
Channel from you and then all of a 

1301
01:16:57,721 --> 01:16:58,600
sudden that moat doesn't look that wide 
does it,

1302
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:04,470
but that's not a lot of positive stuff 
to go into the first global conflict in 

1303
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:06,130
100 years for to the British.

1304
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:11,130
This looks like a massive disruption of 
their extremely profitable business 

1305
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:15,581
ventures.
They've been snapping up books like the 

1306
01:17:15,581 --> 01:17:19,451
great illusion written by Norman Angle 
where every historian points out how 

1307
01:17:19,451 --> 01:17:23,141
influential this book was,
where angle is trying to explain to the 

1308
01:17:23,141 --> 01:17:26,210
people in that time period that this war
that continually gets threatened,

1309
01:17:26,211 --> 01:17:30,350
like the Russian roulette trigger being 
pulled is never going to happen.

1310
01:17:30,351 --> 01:17:35,351
It can't happen.
The world has become to interdependent 

1311
01:17:35,351 --> 01:17:36,530
in that time period.
There's too much globalization.

1312
01:17:36,531 --> 01:17:39,860
This is the early period where all that 
starts where you have the telegraph,

1313
01:17:39,861 --> 01:17:44,861
providing instant communication and the 
railroads on the shipping lines and 

1314
01:17:44,861 --> 01:17:47,060
trade had never been higher.
Wealth had never been grander and Europe

1315
01:17:47,061 --> 01:17:52,061
was at the height of its financial power
and Britain was at the height of 

1316
01:17:52,061 --> 01:17:55,811
everybody's financial power.
Why would you mess with that economic 

1317
01:17:55,811 --> 01:17:55,940
situation?
Guys like angle?

1318
01:17:55,941 --> 01:18:00,941
We're saying that what had happened is 
it was so profitable to simply do 

1319
01:18:00,941 --> 01:18:04,190
business as usual that there was nothing
worth going to war over.

1320
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:10,270
What angle was saying is that anything 
you would gain by launching a war would 

1321
01:18:10,270 --> 01:18:14,411
be dwarfed by what you would lose by 
destroying the system that was allowing 

1322
01:18:14,411 --> 01:18:15,560
everyone to make so much money.
There's an old line,

1323
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:19,250
um,
that when goods don't cross borders,

1324
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:21,440
armies will.
Well,

1325
01:18:21,441 --> 01:18:26,441
this is the opposite situation.
Their goods are crossing borders like 

1326
01:18:26,441 --> 01:18:26,810
crazy.
So guys like angle tell you that,

1327
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:28,610
you know,
because of that formula and they believe

1328
01:18:28,611 --> 01:18:33,611
in that formula.
You can't have a war with the British 

1329
01:18:33,611 --> 01:18:34,040
are starting to find out,
you know,

1330
01:18:34,041 --> 01:18:36,690
as this dead zone period from the end of
the arch,

1331
01:18:36,691 --> 01:18:38,780
Duke's assassination to the ultimate 
unbiased Serbia.

1332
01:18:38,781 --> 01:18:43,781
What the British are starting to find 
out is that angle is at least partially 

1333
01:18:43,781 --> 01:18:44,690
wrong.
He may be right.

1334
01:18:44,691 --> 01:18:47,600
That you will destroy a whole system 
that's making everybody rich.

1335
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:53,020
He seems to be wrong in thinking that 
the powers that be will avoid a war 

1336
01:18:53,751 --> 01:18:58,751
because of that and the British 
government is having a hard time selling

1337
01:19:00,681 --> 01:19:03,020
their people on the idea that this is 
good for Britain.

1338
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:11,460
On July 23rd,
finally the long awaited response from 

1339
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:14,260
the Austro-hungarian government to the 
killing of their heir to the throne.

1340
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:19,860
They send an ultimatum that to the 
government of Serbia and the ultimatum 

1341
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:23,941
is one of those documents you can look 
at throughout history that is obviously 

1342
01:19:23,941 --> 01:19:27,331
designed to be rejected.
The demands would eviscerate Serbian 

1343
01:19:27,371 --> 01:19:29,950
sovereignty,
no sovereign state could agree to this,

1344
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:33,760
and they're only given 48 hours to 
respond to all these different points.

1345
01:19:33,761 --> 01:19:36,070
The rejection of any one of which means 
war.

1346
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:39,400
But the day before the 48 hour deadline 
runs out,

1347
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:43,840
the Serb government sends a message to 
the czar of Russia asking for help,

1348
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:45,520
and they wrote,
quote,

1349
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,940
we cannot defend ourselves.
Therefore we pray.

1350
01:19:48,941 --> 01:19:51,280
Your Majesty descend help as soon as 
possible.

1351
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:54,340
Your Majesty has given many proofs of 
your previous goodwill,

1352
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,620
and we confidently hope that this 
appeal,

1353
01:19:56,621 --> 01:19:58,510
we'll find an echo when you're generous,
Slav,

1354
01:19:58,511 --> 01:20:03,511
heart and quote,
the Serbs send a response back to the 

1355
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:06,160
Austra Hungarians.
It's not good enough.

1356
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:09,600
The declare a war on July,
28th,

1357
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:14,601
exactly one month after the 
assassination and they're shelling 

1358
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:17,961
Belgrade in like five minutes.
The Russians declare mobilization in 

1359
01:20:19,541 --> 01:20:24,541
response to this.
This is the moment when the first 

1360
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:29,240
outside power turns on their doomsday 
device is when the Austra Hungarians and

1361
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:32,600
the Serbians mobilize.
It doesn't freak anyone else out because

1362
01:20:32,601 --> 01:20:37,601
they're going to fight a little war 
against each other and they have to 

1363
01:20:37,601 --> 01:20:39,941
mobilize to do that.
It's when the first outside power tied 

1364
01:20:39,941 --> 01:20:43,841
to these alliance systems,
flicks on their doomsday device that 

1365
01:20:43,841 --> 01:20:45,230
everyone else is going to feel the 
pressure to do the same thing.

1366
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:52,030
Germany,
the most pressure because they're the 

1367
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:53,150
ones with the very short window of 
opportunity.

1368
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:57,170
I think the designer of the military 
plans count.

1369
01:20:57,171 --> 01:20:59,540
Schlieffen had figured out it was about 
900,

1370
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:04,541
950 hours that they had to smash the 
potential of France.

1371
01:21:05,151 --> 01:21:10,151
She didn't have to be mopped up,
but she had to be smashed within 950 or 

1372
01:21:10,151 --> 01:21:13,841
so hours before the Russians would start
to come in from the east with their 

1373
01:21:13,841 --> 01:21:15,980
armies now mobilize.
If you screwed that up,

1374
01:21:16,010 --> 01:21:21,010
they could be in Berlin and having 
coffee and cigarettes and poking the 

1375
01:21:21,010 --> 01:21:22,400
Kaiser with a stick in a cage.
By the time you know,

1376
01:21:22,401 --> 01:21:24,110
the Germans figured out what was going 
on,

1377
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:29,440
so the minute the Russians mobilize,
you have this crisis because the 

1378
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:33,491
Russians have the flexibility.
If they want to have just sending those 

1379
01:21:33,491 --> 01:21:35,090
people home in a month.
Mobilization doesn't mean more to them,

1380
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:40,810
but it does to the Germans because 
they've got to start their plans and 

1381
01:21:41,121 --> 01:21:43,640
every day they don't.
That 950 or so,

1382
01:21:43,641 --> 01:21:44,870
our window is shrinking.

1383
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:51,830
This is the point in the story where the
military plans begin to take over the 

1384
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:56,751
political process in a way that makes it
impossible for the politicians and the 

1385
01:21:56,751 --> 01:21:59,490
diplomat to do what they need to do to 
potentially stop this conflict.

1386
01:21:59,491 --> 01:22:02,070
They need time.
They need time.

1387
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:07,340
On the 26th of July,
the government of Britain calls a peace 

1388
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:07,910
conferences for the major powers that 
they could hash this out,

1389
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,900
talk it out.
Nobody's got the time.

1390
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,630
Once the Russians hit the mobilization 
switch,

1391
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:17,280
the Germans are under pressure.
They tell the Russians to stop.

1392
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:20,690
The Russians say,
we're only doing this against Austria,

1393
01:22:20,691 --> 01:22:21,630
Hungary.
This isn't meant.

1394
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:22,800
You know,
against you.

1395
01:22:22,990 --> 01:22:25,440
Doesn't matter.
The Germans have a problem now,

1396
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:27,210
and they begin going to everyone else 
and saying,

1397
01:22:27,211 --> 01:22:28,040
are you in?
Are you in?

1398
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:30,300
They go to the French.
Let me say to the French,

1399
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:35,990
are you in this conflict that's about to
come out because we're going to go to 

1400
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:35,990
war with the Russians.
If they don't demobilize,

1401
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:36,720
what are you going to do?

1402
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:42,720
The French,
we're going to act in accordance with 

1403
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:42,720
our interest from the German said,
well,

1404
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:43,210
listen,
if you want to stay out of this war,

1405
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:48,360
all you have to do is hand us the keys 
to all your faults on are fortified 

1406
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:50,380
border until the war in the east is 
over.

1407
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:54,220
That says a pledge of your good behavior
and we'll consider you out of this war.

1408
01:22:54,520 --> 01:22:59,520
That is impossible for the French 
government to do as the demands on 

1409
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,810
Serbia war for the Serbians to do fringe
can't do that.

1410
01:23:01,811 --> 01:23:04,570
That's an handover.
Your national security keys to your most

1411
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:07,720
antagonistic historic enemy.
I don't think so,

1412
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:13,050
and the Germans must have known that 
they knew they couldn't keep France out 

1413
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:16,381
of this conflict,
which is why they had these fantastic 

1414
01:23:16,381 --> 01:23:19,561
military plans to defeat,
to powers the country they were really 

1415
01:23:19,561 --> 01:23:22,780
hoping to keep out of the conflict was 
Great Britain when they kept negotiating

1416
01:23:22,781 --> 01:23:24,160
with Britain saying,
you know,

1417
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:26,380
you don't have any deal here.
We're cousins.

1418
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:28,360
We're both Anglo saxons were the same 
race.

1419
01:23:28,361 --> 01:23:29,920
You know the French are your historic 
enemies.

1420
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:34,860
Are you really going to work with them?
On the 30th of July,

1421
01:23:34,861 --> 01:23:37,710
the British prime minister wrote in his 
diary,

1422
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:43,820
quote,
the European situation is at least one 

1423
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:47,061
degree worse than it was yesterday and 
it has not been improved by a rather 

1424
01:23:47,061 --> 01:23:50,841
shameless attempt on the part of Germany
to buy our neutrality during the war by 

1425
01:23:50,841 --> 01:23:55,521
promises that she will not annex French 
territory except colonies or Holland or 

1426
01:23:55,741 --> 01:24:00,741
Belgium.
There is something very crude he writes 

1427
01:24:00,741 --> 01:24:01,530
and childlike about German diplomacy.
Meanwhile,

1428
01:24:01,531 --> 01:24:05,100
the French are beginning to press in the
opposite sense as the Russians have been

1429
01:24:05,101 --> 01:24:08,190
doing for some time the city he means 
London,

1430
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:11,790
which is in a terrible state of 
depression and paralysis is for the time

1431
01:24:11,791 --> 01:24:16,791
being all against English intervention.
I think the prospect very black today 

1432
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:22,250
and to quote,
but something will happen that will 

1433
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:26,311
change the mood in Britain.
Something that will help to create a 

1434
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,140
good guy,
bad guy narrative in this war.

1435
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,490
You know,
as I told you earlier,

1436
01:24:30,491 --> 01:24:35,491
one of the key issues,
because this war is so important to the 

1437
01:24:35,491 --> 01:24:38,191
rest of the 20th century in 21st century
history is whose fault at all is and the

1438
01:24:38,321 --> 01:24:41,650
British are very concerned during this 
time period that they be.

1439
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:44,740
If they intervene,
intervening on the right side,

1440
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:47,890
who's the bad guy?
It's going to depend on what happens.

1441
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:53,960
That's again where the German war plans 
put them in a situation where for the 

1442
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:58,281
war plan to succeed,
you have to create strategic problems 

1443
01:24:58,281 --> 01:24:59,700
that are going to cost you the war.
The biggest thing the Germans need to do

1444
01:24:59,701 --> 01:25:01,500
here is keep the British out of this 
war,

1445
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:06,770
but the war plans involve a requirement 
that will bring the British into the 

1446
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:11,091
war.
The Germans can't attack the French 

1447
01:25:11,091 --> 01:25:12,080
along their mutual border.
That border is full of forts.

1448
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:17,630
It's the most one of the most fortified 
borders throughout world history ever 

1449
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:17,970
since Roman times.
It's the same area,

1450
01:25:17,971 --> 01:25:22,971
but 120 mile front that will become the 
Maginot line after this war and before 

1451
01:25:22,981 --> 01:25:25,470
the Second World War.
During this time period,

1452
01:25:25,471 --> 01:25:30,471
there are fantastically technologically 
sophisticated forts all through this 120

1453
01:25:30,721 --> 01:25:35,721
mile border between Germany and France 
with interlocking fields of fire and 

1454
01:25:35,821 --> 01:25:40,821
large garrison's.
It's not that the Germans can't defeat 

1455
01:25:40,821 --> 01:25:40,821
that.
They did in 18,

1456
01:25:40,821 --> 01:25:41,730
70 18,
71.

1457
01:25:41,731 --> 01:25:46,731
That was the root of invasion back then.
The problem is the Germans can't defeat 

1458
01:25:46,731 --> 01:25:50,280
them within that 950 or so.
Our window,

1459
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:53,760
by the time the German smashed their way
through those forts,

1460
01:25:54,030 --> 01:25:57,660
the Russians are in Berlin and Silesia 
and everywhere else.

1461
01:25:57,661 --> 01:26:02,661
Right?
So there's only one thing the Germans 

1462
01:26:02,661 --> 01:26:05,511
can see their way to doing as part of 
this plan to win the two front and 

1463
01:26:05,511 --> 01:26:05,511
that's

1464
01:26:05,511 --> 01:26:07,010
just smashed into France and the part of
France that's undefended,

1465
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:12,280
but the reason the part of France that's
undefended or less defended than this 

1466
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:16,200
fortified border is less defendant is 
because it isn't on the border with 

1467
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,420
Germany,
so on the border with a bunch of neutral

1468
01:26:17,421 --> 01:26:22,421
states,
these are going to have to be the 

1469
01:26:22,421 --> 01:26:24,740
highways the German army uses to get 
from Germany to France.

1470
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:28,550
The only problem is is that those 
highways neutrality is guaranteed by the

1471
01:26:28,551 --> 01:26:32,240
British government and has been for 75 
years.

1472
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:38,940
What is about to happen as a result of 
the stipulations of those German war 

1473
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:42,571
plans is potentially the greatest 
mistake ever made.

1474
01:26:43,450 --> 01:26:45,670
I mean,
I'd put it on my top 10 list somewhere.

1475
01:26:45,671 --> 01:26:47,950
Greatest mistakes ever made,
and if you're a German,

1476
01:26:47,951 --> 01:26:52,951
I have to believe that I have a hard 
time figuring out what is a greater 

1477
01:26:52,951 --> 01:26:57,691
mistake for the entire history of your 
nation as a unified country since 18,

1478
01:26:57,731 --> 01:27:00,200
71.
I have a hard time finding something you

1479
01:27:00,201 --> 01:27:05,201
could label as a greater mistake than 
this one because so many of the other 

1480
01:27:05,201 --> 01:27:08,881
candidates you might put as your 
greatest mistake only happened because 

1481
01:27:08,881 --> 01:27:12,841
of this mistake before it.
The invasion of Belgium is a disaster 

1482
01:27:12,841 --> 01:27:15,100
for Germany on so many fronts and that's
what we're talking about here.

1483
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:18,640
Originally,
way back in like the late 18 hundreds,

1484
01:27:18,641 --> 01:27:23,641
early 19 hundreds.
Holland had also been on the list of 

1485
01:27:23,641 --> 01:27:23,800
countries to be used as a highway for 
the German army.

1486
01:27:23,801 --> 01:27:26,890
But since that time and as the war plans
were refined,

1487
01:27:26,891 --> 01:27:31,891
it was just narrowed down to just 
Belgium and the Germans were sort of 

1488
01:27:31,891 --> 01:27:33,460
naively hoping that the Belgians would 
just step aside,

1489
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:38,900
like line their army up on both sides of
the street and watched the Germans 

1490
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:38,900
marched through.
Um,

1491
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,390
the British and the Russians,
you know,

1492
01:27:41,410 --> 01:27:46,410
who are sort of the forefathers of these
Germans were two of the signatories to 

1493
01:27:46,410 --> 01:27:50,131
something called the Treaty of London in
1839 that pledged to defend Belgium's 

1494
01:27:50,131 --> 01:27:50,830
neutrality

1495
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:55,940
in a wonderfully tragic,
ironic sort of connection to,

1496
01:27:55,941 --> 01:28:00,941
by the way,
the role Belgium is going to play 

1497
01:28:00,941 --> 01:28:03,881
leading to the first world war is very 
similar to the role Poland played 

1498
01:28:03,881 --> 01:28:07,010
leading up to the second in both cases,
those countries where the reason Britain

1499
01:28:07,011 --> 01:28:10,040
got dragged into the conflict before the
Second World War,

1500
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:15,041
Britain had tried to stop Hitler's 
seemingly endless ambition by putting a 

1501
01:28:16,101 --> 01:28:18,820
roadblock in his way in guaranteeing the
independence of Poland.

1502
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:24,250
Hitler ignored that guarantee went into 
Poland and Britain's and the war in the 

1503
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:28,061
first world war.
The same thing is happening with 

1504
01:28:28,061 --> 01:28:29,891
Belgium.
The German planners can see no way to 

1505
01:28:29,891 --> 01:28:29,891
win this war without violating Belgium's
neutrality.

1506
01:28:29,891 --> 01:28:34,861
As we said,
this is what makes it the greatest 

1507
01:28:34,861 --> 01:28:37,211
mistake though potentially in all German
history because violating Belgium ends 

1508
01:28:37,211 --> 01:28:40,931
up taking a Britain that one historian 
says as recently as two days before they

1509
01:28:41,361 --> 01:28:45,230
declare war on Germany is leaning toward
neutrality.

1510
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:48,230
That's amazing to think about two days 
before they enter the war,

1511
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:50,450
the government is leaning toward 
neutrality.

1512
01:28:50,451 --> 01:28:52,760
What changed that?
The invasion of Belgium,

1513
01:28:54,890 --> 01:28:57,980
the invasion of Belgium does to terrible
things.

1514
01:28:57,981 --> 01:28:59,930
If you're looking at this from Germany's
point of view,

1515
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,830
the first thing is changes.

1516
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:04,410
British,
political and public opinion,

1517
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:06,330
almost overnight on a dime

1518
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,690
as the British prime minister,
Herbert Asquith put it.

1519
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:15,720
He of course wants to get more involved 
in this looming war because of the 

1520
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:17,620
handshake deal with France.
He said that the ultimatum,

1521
01:29:17,621 --> 01:29:20,530
the Germans give to the Belgians,
simplify matters.

1522
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:25,800
All of a sudden the people who are 
trying to convince the rest of Britain 

1523
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:28,741
that they have a dog in this continental
war looming up have some real 

1524
01:29:28,741 --> 01:29:32,701
ammunition.
The first thing is a signed treaty with 

1525
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:35,641
the Belgians.
That's not a handshake deal that's in 

1526
01:29:35,641 --> 01:29:38,820
inc and its long standing as is the 
national security concern that Britain 

1527
01:29:38,831 --> 01:29:43,831
has had for a very long time of keeping 
the channel ports in Belgium out of the 

1528
01:29:43,831 --> 01:29:47,971
hands of some dangerous,
hostile power throughout most of 

1529
01:29:47,971 --> 01:29:48,790
Britain's history.
That dangerous hostile power was France,

1530
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,370
but they're calling the kaiser,
the new Napoleon,

1531
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:55,000
and if he goes into Belgium,
he's going to have those channel ports.

1532
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:59,520
So what had been a more sort of high 
brow,

1533
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:04,450
a argument that didn't really appeal to 
the gut is changing because of Belgium.

1534
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:09,900
The most important appeal to the gut 
though that Belgium has is the 

1535
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:12,010
propaganda slash pr side of this whole 
thing.

1536
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:18,060
Belgium is what destroys Germany's 
reputation in terms of global public 

1537
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:22,741
opinion.
I mean there'd always been people who 

1538
01:30:22,741 --> 01:30:22,741
called Germany,
this evil malevolent,

1539
01:30:22,741 --> 01:30:26,970
militaristic country and what have you 
been on the world stage as soon as the 

1540
01:30:26,970 --> 01:30:30,841
Germans invaded Belgium,
they participate in the most aggressive 

1541
01:30:30,841 --> 01:30:33,070
act so far by any of the major powers in
this conflict.

1542
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:38,280
Austro-Hungarian assault against Serbia 
maybe before this was the most 

1543
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:40,540
egregious,
but that was seen as having some sort of

1544
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:46,350
connection to events.
I mean the Serbian government had maybe 

1545
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:49,501
been involved in this assassination.
There was something to do with one 

1546
01:30:49,501 --> 01:30:49,501
another.
Belgium was an innocent bystander,

1547
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:54,960
you know,
it's like a shooting war breaks out 

1548
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:56,851
between a couple of of gangsters on the 
street and the first thing one of the 

1549
01:30:56,851 --> 01:31:00,361
gangsters does is turn to the side and 
kills an innocent bystander because 

1550
01:31:00,361 --> 01:31:03,721
they're standing in their way.
That's a little like what this is 

1551
01:31:03,721 --> 01:31:03,721
portrayed as by,
you know,

1552
01:31:03,721 --> 01:31:08,161
the allied propaganda services which 
make the most use of this Belgium thing 

1553
01:31:08,161 --> 01:31:10,120
you can imagine.
So much so that it incense,

1554
01:31:10,210 --> 01:31:15,210
people like off Hitler who will write 
later in mind comp that nowhere else 

1555
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:17,470
did.
The Germans,

1556
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:22,800
you know,
fall so far behind the British and the 

1557
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:22,800
French later the Americans than they did
in the.

1558
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:23,980
In the realm of propaganda.

1559
01:31:25,490 --> 01:31:27,890
Hitler says the huge mistake of Germany 
and Austria,

1560
01:31:27,891 --> 01:31:31,730
Hungary is propaganda was to portray the
enemy as comical.

1561
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:34,580
And he said that the British and the 
French,

1562
01:31:34,581 --> 01:31:39,581
the Americans understand that the enemy 
needs to be seen as vile and dangerous 

1563
01:31:39,891 --> 01:31:44,891
and blood thirsty and is bad.
Not Comical because he said the problem 

1564
01:31:44,891 --> 01:31:49,121
with portraying them as comical as you 
run up against them and they're tough 

1565
01:31:49,121 --> 01:31:50,000
and that seems to shatter all the 
propaganda.

1566
01:31:50,001 --> 01:31:52,120
It's better to say they're these evil,
you know,

1567
01:31:52,121 --> 01:31:54,830
the nine riders have more door are 
approaching.

1568
01:31:54,831 --> 01:31:56,180
He says,
and then you know,

1569
01:31:56,181 --> 01:32:00,280
you really get your back into a cause 
like that and how the allies,

1570
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,670
which is what Britain,
France and many other countries,

1571
01:32:03,671 --> 01:32:08,671
the United States later included,
will be called in this war there 

1572
01:32:08,671 --> 01:32:09,460
initially called the triple entente.
The other side,

1573
01:32:09,461 --> 01:32:12,010
the alliance with Germany,
Austria,

1574
01:32:12,011 --> 01:32:17,011
hungry.
Later Turkey and some other countries 

1575
01:32:17,011 --> 01:32:17,011
will be called the central powers.

1576
01:32:17,011 --> 01:32:19,360
And so it's the triple entente against 
the central powers or the allies against

1577
01:32:19,361 --> 01:32:22,990
the central powers.
And the central powers will be portrayed

1578
01:32:22,991 --> 01:32:27,991
just as Hitler said,
as these rapers and pillagers and 

1579
01:32:27,991 --> 01:32:31,681
looters and it will be in Belgium.
That the Germans will provide their 

1580
01:32:31,681 --> 01:32:36,661
opponents with the raw materials to not 
have to exaggerate too much at all to 

1581
01:32:37,331 --> 01:32:40,630
portray them as the modern day version 
of the huns.

1582
01:32:41,980 --> 01:32:46,180
Now on August first 19,
14,

1583
01:32:46,780 --> 01:32:51,780
this small war between the ostrow 
Hungarians and the Serbs gets bigger 

1584
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:59,700
because that's when the German ultimatum
given to the Russians telling them to 

1585
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:02,020
stop their mobilization or else runs 
out.

1586
01:33:02,860 --> 01:33:07,860
Historian David Stevenson says that this
is a clear sign that the Russians know 

1587
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:11,740
what's coming and they're okay with it.
They know that if they don't stand down,

1588
01:33:11,741 --> 01:33:14,410
they'll have war with Germany and they 
don't stand down,

1589
01:33:14,830 --> 01:33:18,790
so he says one way or another,
you have to infer that the Russians were

1590
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:20,110
ready for this and okay with it.

1591
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:26,190
So on August first,
the Germans declare war on the Russians 

1592
01:33:26,190 --> 01:33:27,340
that day.
Italy says they're out.

1593
01:33:27,670 --> 01:33:30,250
They had a nominal alliance with Germany
and Austria,

1594
01:33:30,251 --> 01:33:35,251
Hungary,
but they choose to use an out clause 

1595
01:33:35,251 --> 01:33:36,040
which may or may not be valid depending 
on who you're talking to,

1596
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:41,250
saying that this appears to be an 
aggressive war and their alliance only 

1597
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:41,680
covers defensive war,
so they're out.

1598
01:33:41,770 --> 01:33:44,230
They declared that they are neutral in 
this new conflict.

1599
01:33:44,231 --> 01:33:48,610
It's just starting the next day in the 
West.

1600
01:33:48,820 --> 01:33:51,820
Germany invades the neutral country of 
Luxembourg,

1601
01:33:51,821 --> 01:33:53,860
the tiny little neutral country of 
Luxembourg.

1602
01:33:54,070 --> 01:33:57,720
And at the same time issues this 
ultimatum to the Belgians saying,

1603
01:33:57,730 --> 01:34:02,730
listen,
we just need to use your country to get 

1604
01:34:02,730 --> 01:34:02,730
to France.
Uh,

1605
01:34:02,730 --> 01:34:03,370
we mean you no harm.
Just let us march through.

1606
01:34:03,371 --> 01:34:05,350
If we break anything,
we'll pay for it later and we don't have

1607
01:34:05,351 --> 01:34:08,980
any designs on your country longterm in 
response to this.

1608
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:12,700
The Belgians have a heroic moment where 
the king of Belgium,

1609
01:34:13,030 --> 01:34:13,440
you know,
and,

1610
01:34:13,441 --> 01:34:16,990
and the major officials all get together
and basically all agree that they're not

1611
01:34:16,991 --> 01:34:21,991
going to stand down.
The attitude they seem to have is we're 

1612
01:34:21,991 --> 01:34:25,711
screwed either way.
We might as well go out of this 

1613
01:34:25,711 --> 01:34:28,531
gloriously and they decide to mobilize 
their tiny little army and fight and at 

1614
01:34:28,531 --> 01:34:32,641
the same time issue the calls to the 
other guarantors of their neutrality 

1615
01:34:32,641 --> 01:34:33,130
saying,
um,

1616
01:34:33,340 --> 01:34:38,340
you know,
and they waited until the moment the 

1617
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:38,340
Germans,
by the way,

1618
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:41,101
stepped in.
Everybody's worried that somebody's 

1619
01:34:41,101 --> 01:34:42,820
going to pull a fast one and try to feel
like that the French are worried the 

1620
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:46,051
Germans are going to try to fake them 
into going into Belgium first because 

1621
01:34:46,051 --> 01:34:47,560
they think the Germans are coming in and
then the Germans can say,

1622
01:34:47,561 --> 01:34:49,300
we weren't the first people to violate 
Belgium.

1623
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:52,450
Everybody wants to stay on the good side
in terms of war,

1624
01:34:52,451 --> 01:34:57,451
responsibility.
The French are so worried about falling 

1625
01:34:57,451 --> 01:35:00,181
into a trap like that.
They pulled unprecedented move of all 

1626
01:35:00,181 --> 01:35:03,491
time and on the eve of war,
pulled their military forces six miles 

1627
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:06,470
back from the border.
Remember,

1628
01:35:06,471 --> 01:35:11,471
that's not just forward positioning.
Those are troops who picked the spots 

1629
01:35:11,471 --> 01:35:13,730
that they were in because they're 
important strategic spots,

1630
01:35:13,731 --> 01:35:18,731
important passes and river crossings and
other things that have been built up 

1631
01:35:18,731 --> 01:35:21,851
with fortifications for years and the 
French government is so freaked out 

1632
01:35:21,851 --> 01:35:25,931
about possibly being blamed for starting
this and the Germans not being blamed 

1633
01:35:25,931 --> 01:35:27,830
for starting this,
that they pull their forces back.

1634
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:30,320
The French generals are not pleased 
about this,

1635
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:35,560
but the move is intended to also make 
sure that the British people and the 

1636
01:35:35,560 --> 01:35:37,280
peace faction in Britain have no excuse 
to say,

1637
01:35:37,281 --> 01:35:42,281
well,
French violated Belgian neutrality 

1638
01:35:42,281 --> 01:35:42,281
first,
or shots were fired by the French first,

1639
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:48,040
so the Germans are positioned into this 
thing where they have a time limit on 

1640
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:48,040
this deal.

1641
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:51,940
They can't sit around and wait around.
Belgium has to be violated for the plan 

1642
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:53,060
to work.
They can't get the French or the British

1643
01:35:53,061 --> 01:35:54,470
to violate Belgium.
First.

1644
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:56,660
They tell the Belgians,
you know,

1645
01:35:56,661 --> 01:36:01,340
to let them through the Belgian say no,
and on August third,

1646
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:05,540
Germany declares war on France and 
Belgium.

1647
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:09,980
Now think about that folks.
A week ago,

1648
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:15,160
Europe was peaceful.
Now it's on the slide to general war.

1649
01:36:15,591 --> 01:36:20,591
Within another week,
the entire continent is going to be 

1650
01:36:20,591 --> 01:36:20,591
flaming out at each other.
I mean,

1651
01:36:20,591 --> 01:36:24,821
that's crazy to go from total peace to 
total war in less than two weeks.

1652
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:30,640
Hg Wells writing a year or two after the
conflict ends.

1653
01:36:30,641 --> 01:36:32,180
So He's right in the middle of the 
moment.

1654
01:36:32,181 --> 01:36:33,530
He even says,
you can't quite,

1655
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:36,380
you know,
you can't write about it now without the

1656
01:36:36,381 --> 01:36:38,090
passions and the feelings,
you know,

1657
01:36:38,091 --> 01:36:40,310
totally screwing up your impression of 
things,

1658
01:36:40,490 --> 01:36:45,490
but he does talk about how weird the 
mood was because all this was happening 

1659
01:36:45,490 --> 01:36:49,811
so fast and he was talking about the 
British public because that's where he 

1660
01:36:49,811 --> 01:36:52,511
lived and how there was almost this 
disconnect between the fact that the 

1661
01:36:52,511 --> 01:36:57,101
entire world has changed,
but it's happening so fast we haven't 

1662
01:36:57,101 --> 01:36:57,350
changed with it yet,
and he writes,

1663
01:36:57,351 --> 01:37:02,351
quote,
all Europe still remembers the strange 

1664
01:37:02,351 --> 01:37:03,830
atmosphere of those eventful sunny 
August days.

1665
01:37:04,070 --> 01:37:07,730
The end of the armed piece for nearly 
half a century,

1666
01:37:07,731 --> 01:37:10,850
the western world had been tranquil and 
it seemed safe.

1667
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:16,120
Only a few middle aged and ageing people
in France had had any practical 

1668
01:37:16,120 --> 01:37:19,871
experience of warfare.
The newspapers spoke of a world 

1669
01:37:19,871 --> 01:37:21,020
catastrophe,
but that conveyed very little meaning to

1670
01:37:21,021 --> 01:37:23,300
those for whom the world.
It always seems secure,

1671
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:28,540
who were indeed almost incapable of 
thinking of it as anything otherwise 

1672
01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:31,310
then secure in Britain particularly for 
some weeks,

1673
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:35,120
the peace time routine continued in a 
slightly dazed fashion.

1674
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,910
It wasn't like a man still walking about
the world,

1675
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:43,080
unaware that he has contracted a fatal 
disease which will alter every routine 

1676
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:47,531
and habit in his life.
People went on with their summer 

1677
01:37:47,531 --> 01:37:47,531
holidays,
shops,

1678
01:37:47,531 --> 01:37:50,210
reassured their customers with the 
announcement business as usual.

1679
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:52,880
There was much talk and excitement when 
the newspapers came,

1680
01:37:53,090 --> 01:37:56,340
but it was the talk and excitement of 
spectators have no vivid

1681
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:01,340
sense of participation in the 
catastrophe that was presently to 

1682
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:02,400
involve them all and quote.

1683
01:38:03,770 --> 01:38:08,770
It's easy to understand too,
why the British public really weren't 

1684
01:38:08,770 --> 01:38:08,780
ready for this.
In fact,

1685
01:38:09,290 --> 01:38:11,690
none of the British were really ready 
for this.

1686
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:16,780
They hadn't been mentally prepped for 
the idea that this was coming for all 

1687
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:20,831
sorts of political reasons.
The British government couldn't declare 

1688
01:38:20,831 --> 01:38:23,600
itself outright and sort of draw a line 
in the sand and tell the Germans,

1689
01:38:23,601 --> 01:38:24,710
listen,
if you invade Belgium,

1690
01:38:24,711 --> 01:38:26,090
it's on no ifs,
ands,

1691
01:38:26,091 --> 01:38:31,091
or buts.
The British prime minister didn't have 

1692
01:38:31,091 --> 01:38:33,611
that power for all he knew the piece 
faction in his government would topple 

1693
01:38:33,611 --> 01:38:36,511
is government.
If a statement like that were made and 

1694
01:38:36,511 --> 01:38:39,850
both the French and the Germans for a 
very long time before this conflict 

1695
01:38:39,850 --> 01:38:40,640
breaks out,
but especially in the fevered,

1696
01:38:40,910 --> 01:38:45,910
you know,
last month are trying to get some sort 

1697
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:45,910
of word from Great Britain,
what the policy is,

1698
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:46,730
what are you going to do at the last 
minute?

1699
01:38:46,731 --> 01:38:48,890
The French are sure the British are 
going to abandon them.

1700
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:53,590
The French foreign minister will sit 
down and discuss it at one point and say

1701
01:38:53,591 --> 01:38:57,100
they're going to desert us and when 
someone in the British media asked him,

1702
01:38:57,101 --> 01:38:57,760
what are you doing?
He says,

1703
01:38:57,761 --> 01:39:00,160
I'm going to wait to see if Britain 
still has any honor.

1704
01:39:02,630 --> 01:39:07,630
The British are waiting for something to
happen in Belgium and somewhere the 

1705
01:39:07,630 --> 01:39:11,141
Belgians,
they don't want to do anything until 

1706
01:39:11,141 --> 01:39:13,601
their actual neutrality is violated.
So they wait until the Germans arrived 

1707
01:39:13,601 --> 01:39:17,500
when the advance cavalry patrols and 
actually some guys on bicycles believed 

1708
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:21,971
or non pedal into Belgium and give 
notices to the locals that we're sorry 

1709
01:39:21,971 --> 01:39:24,560
that we have to do this and uh,
everything will be fine.

1710
01:39:24,561 --> 01:39:26,990
Just don't cause any trouble.
Don't blow up any bridges.

1711
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:32,320
Don't sabotage any railways,
don't destroy any tunnels,

1712
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,370
anything we might need to get from here 
to there,

1713
01:39:34,610 --> 01:39:38,150
leave all that in place or those will be
considered hostile acts.

1714
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:42,200
As soon as it becomes apparent that 
Germans are on Belgian soil,

1715
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:47,560
the king of Belgium basically orders 
that all those things be done and then 

1716
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:49,820
he contacts the other guarantors of 
Belgian neutrality and says,

1717
01:39:50,330 --> 01:39:51,410
the Germans are here.

1718
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:56,680
We need your help.
That's when the British draw up the 

1719
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:58,880
official sort of ultimatum,
which people have criticized them for.

1720
01:39:58,881 --> 01:40:03,881
I mean they say if you don't only give 
him that ultimatum before the Germans 

1721
01:40:03,881 --> 01:40:06,971
had gone into Belgium,
they might've had more options once 

1722
01:40:06,971 --> 01:40:08,690
they're in Belgium for them to get out 
of Belgium because the British told them

1723
01:40:08,691 --> 01:40:11,600
to was really like a tail between their 
legs kind of situation.

1724
01:40:11,601 --> 01:40:16,601
And this has happened in history many 
times in other situations where people 

1725
01:40:16,601 --> 01:40:17,750
have said,
if you had just said what you were going

1726
01:40:17,751 --> 01:40:21,710
to do before the enemy did what they did
might've been a different outcome.

1727
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:24,500
In this case,
once the Germans are in Belgium,

1728
01:40:25,010 --> 01:40:29,690
the British ambassador to Germany,
a guy named Sir Edward Goshen,

1729
01:40:29,930 --> 01:40:34,930
delivers the British ultimatum to 
Germany and he delivers it into the 

1730
01:40:34,930 --> 01:40:37,580
hands of the German minister,
a guy named Godly Vanya Ego,

1731
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:40,670
and the German chancellor,
a guiding theobold bond.

1732
01:40:40,670 --> 01:40:45,670
Beckman Halweg and Gosha knew that this 
was a historic meeting and he wrote down

1733
01:40:46,521 --> 01:40:51,521
what happened and he said the Germans,
when they received this ultimatum from 

1734
01:40:51,521 --> 01:40:52,280
him,
freaked out.

1735
01:40:53,110 --> 01:40:56,590
You wrote that the meeting was fraught 
with menace quote.

1736
01:40:57,070 --> 01:41:00,140
I found the chancellor very agitated.
His excellence.

1737
01:41:00,141 --> 01:41:03,610
He at once began a harangue,
which lasted for about 20 minutes.

1738
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:08,820
He said that the step taken by the 
British government was terrible to a 

1739
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:12,661
degree just for a word neutrality,
a word which in war time it's so often 

1740
01:41:12,701 --> 01:41:15,370
been disregarded just for a scrap of 
paper.

1741
01:41:15,371 --> 01:41:20,371
Great Britain was going to make war on a
kindred nation who desired nothing 

1742
01:41:20,371 --> 01:41:24,541
better than to be friends with her.
All his efforts in that direction had 

1743
01:41:24,541 --> 01:41:25,360
been rendered useless by this last 
terrible step,

1744
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:30,600
and the policy to which as I knew he had
devoted himself since is a session to 

1745
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:32,620
office,
had tumbled down like a house of cards.

1746
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:36,190
What we had done was unthinkable in the 
minds of the Germans.

1747
01:41:36,580 --> 01:41:41,580
It was like striking a man from behind 
while he was fighting for his life 

1748
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:44,791
against two assailants.
He yelled Great Britain responsible for 

1749
01:41:44,791 --> 01:41:44,800
all the terrible events that might 
happen.

1750
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:50,160
I protested strongly against that 
statement and said that in the same way 

1751
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:53,050
that he inherited don Diego wished me to
understand that for strategical reasons,

1752
01:41:53,051 --> 01:41:58,051
it was a matter of life and death to 
Germany to advance through Belgium and 

1753
01:41:58,051 --> 01:42:01,291
violate the ladders neutrality,
so I would wish them to understand that 

1754
01:42:01,291 --> 01:42:03,010
it was so to speak,
a matter of life and death for the honor

1755
01:42:03,011 --> 01:42:08,011
of Great Britain,
that she should keep her Solomon 

1756
01:42:08,011 --> 01:42:10,191
engagements to do our utmost,
to defend Belgium's neutrality if 

1757
01:42:10,191 --> 01:42:13,171
attacked,
that solemn compact simply had to be 

1758
01:42:13,171 --> 01:42:16,201
kept or what confidence could anyone 
have in engagements given by Great 

1759
01:42:16,201 --> 01:42:16,201
Britain in the future.

1760
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:20,770
The chancellor said,
but at what price will that compact have

1761
01:42:20,771 --> 01:42:25,771
been kept?
As the British government thought of 

1762
01:42:25,771 --> 01:42:28,171
that and quote,
and this is an interesting key point 

1763
01:42:29,170 --> 01:42:34,170
because I've often wondered if you could
take the principals who were the 

1764
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:38,401
decision makers in this conflict into 
the future and show them some history 

1765
01:42:38,401 --> 01:42:41,110
books and show them what had happened,
even the winners.

1766
01:42:41,830 --> 01:42:45,850
Do you think they would've found a way 
to avert what ended up happening because

1767
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:48,400
it was more horrible than any of them 
envisioned?

1768
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:52,810
The German field marshal in charge of 
the military affairs at this time.

1769
01:42:52,811 --> 01:42:57,811
Von Moltke famously said that this was 
the struggle that would decide the 

1770
01:42:57,811 --> 01:43:01,030
course of history for the next hundred 
years and he was absolutely right.

1771
01:43:01,031 --> 01:43:06,031
Maybe more,
but had he known that this would mean 

1772
01:43:06,031 --> 01:43:09,850
that Germany would be on the losing end 
of two World Wars in the 20th century.

1773
01:43:10,950 --> 01:43:11,890
What do you think he would have done?

1774
01:43:11,890 --> 01:43:16,890
I mean,
look at the situation now and imagine 

1775
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:19,531
Germany without having lost those two 
world wars and how different they might 

1776
01:43:19,531 --> 01:43:22,540
be today.
There are German historians who consider

1777
01:43:22,750 --> 01:43:27,750
this role of the iron dice as going to 
war here is often referred to as one of 

1778
01:43:27,911 --> 01:43:32,911
the great,
irresponsible gambles in all German 

1779
01:43:32,911 --> 01:43:35,671
history,
and maybe the key element in the whole 

1780
01:43:35,671 --> 01:43:40,081
affair was Britain's decision to involve
itself in the conflict because one can 

1781
01:43:40,571 --> 01:43:43,720
make a very good case that if Britain 
stands aside,

1782
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:46,600
Germany wins this war that's about to 
start.

1783
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:52,800
Instead,
they have perhaps the greatest overall 

1784
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:57,040
superpower in the early 20th century 
world lining up on the other side,

1785
01:43:59,280 --> 01:44:02,790
and to be truthful,
the Germans weren't really afraid of the

1786
01:44:02,791 --> 01:44:04,740
British army.
I mean,

1787
01:44:04,741 --> 01:44:09,741
that's a small colonial force that by 
German standards is relatively 

1788
01:44:09,991 --> 01:44:14,991
insignificant or so they think.
I mean bismarck had famously said when 

1789
01:44:14,991 --> 01:44:17,040
an advisor had warned him that if you go
to war with Britain,

1790
01:44:17,041 --> 01:44:22,041
they could use that wonderful naval 
power to land their entire army on our 

1791
01:44:22,041 --> 01:44:23,250
coastline.
And Bismark famously said,

1792
01:44:23,251 --> 01:44:25,350
if they do that,
I shall have them arrested.

1793
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:29,790
Meaning he just send the police force 
out to corral the British army.

1794
01:44:29,791 --> 01:44:34,791
That's how worried they were about this 
tiny little force that their army 

1795
01:44:34,791 --> 01:44:38,811
dwarfed,
but they were keenly aware that Britain 

1796
01:44:38,811 --> 01:44:41,100
had the greatest navy by far in the 
world.

1797
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:44,370
They were the greatest financial power 
in the world.

1798
01:44:44,730 --> 01:44:47,670
They controlled a huge chunk of the 
world.

1799
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:52,940
Britain and France together owned about 
70 percent of the world at this time 

1800
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:55,350
period when you talk about all their 
colonies and everything else,

1801
01:44:55,351 --> 01:44:58,950
and that's all stuff that they can draw 
on to fight the war.

1802
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:04,280
What's more that wonderful navy have 
Great Britain's can shut down German 

1803
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:04,280
shipping,
you know,

1804
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:09,091
in a moment at a stroke of a pen,
Britain's foreign secretary Sir Edward 

1805
01:45:09,870 --> 01:45:11,340
Gray on August third,
19,

1806
01:45:11,341 --> 01:45:16,341
14 when tensions have reached a knife 
edge fever pitched moment.

1807
01:45:16,890 --> 01:45:19,830
We'll look out the window and see the 
lamp.

1808
01:45:19,831 --> 01:45:24,831
Lighters of London lighting the lamps 
for the evening as was customary at the 

1809
01:45:24,831 --> 01:45:28,311
time,
and he turned to someone else at the 

1810
01:45:28,311 --> 01:45:30,300
window and famously said,
the lamps are going out all over Europe.

1811
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:33,120
We shall not see them lit again in our 
lifetime.

1812
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:39,460
The Germans are given the famous 
ultimatum and it's set to expire at 

1813
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:45,220
midnight on August fourth German time,
which is 11:00

1814
01:45:45,770 --> 01:45:48,290
PM British time.
Lloyd George,

1815
01:45:48,291 --> 01:45:53,291
one of the ministers says that they were
sitting around a table just before the 

1816
01:45:53,391 --> 01:45:58,391
stroke of 11 watching the clock tick 
away and he said that his big bands 

1817
01:45:58,391 --> 01:46:03,370
chime start shiming for the 11:00
hour signifying that the deadline is 

1818
01:46:03,370 --> 01:46:04,250
about to expire.
He says,

1819
01:46:04,310 --> 01:46:07,430
every ring of the bell sounded like 
doom,

1820
01:46:07,490 --> 01:46:09,020
doom,
doom,

1821
01:46:10,040 --> 01:46:13,550
and then when it expires,
Britain declares war on Germany

1822
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:19,950
and it's worth asking at this point what
the people who adjust,

1823
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:25,290
you know,
entered upon this course of action 

1824
01:46:25,290 --> 01:46:25,340
thought was going to happen when Lloyd 
George,

1825
01:46:25,610 --> 01:46:27,860
here's the chimes of big bend sounding 
and things.

1826
01:46:27,861 --> 01:46:32,000
They sound like doom.
What does Lloyd George mean when he says

1827
01:46:32,001 --> 01:46:37,001
doom?
I mean this is a conflict of the sort 

1828
01:46:37,001 --> 01:46:40,490
that Europe had not had for 100 years 
and a lot of changed in 100 years.

1829
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:45,700
This is like a jump off of a cliff in 
the dark for Europe and no one knows how

1830
01:46:46,251 --> 01:46:50,190
long the drop is going to be and they've
been exposed to a lot of thinking

1831
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:55,190
out there by guys like Norman Angle we 
mentioned earlier who were saying no 

1832
01:46:55,190 --> 01:46:57,090
one's going to jump.
Jumping would be suicidal,

1833
01:46:57,091 --> 01:46:59,250
everybody die.
The golden goose would be killed.

1834
01:46:59,251 --> 01:47:01,140
Globalization will be destroyed.
No one will do it,

1835
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:05,190
and now they had just done it.
What did people think that meant?

1836
01:47:06,450 --> 01:47:07,410
Well,
as we said earlier,

1837
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:10,310
the first world war has so much written 
about it that you can share.

1838
01:47:10,311 --> 01:47:14,100
We pick from this or that source and 
create any sort of impression you want.

1839
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,740
What it really looks like though,
if you sum up,

1840
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:21,800
you know,
I've read a bunch of stuff on this and 

1841
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:23,361
and to me what it looks like is that 
there was a small view amongst some 

1842
01:47:24,241 --> 01:47:29,241
people that understood the reality and 
they turn out to be the Cassandra's in 

1843
01:47:29,241 --> 01:47:29,650
the story.
The,

1844
01:47:29,670 --> 01:47:33,810
the ones who actually prophesies 
accurately what's going to happen.

1845
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:35,670
Most of these people didn't have a clue.

1846
01:47:35,670 --> 01:47:38,800
I think Lloyd George,
when he hears Big Ben Sounding Doom,

1847
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:44,150
is worried about Britain's financial 
sector and he had every reason to be by 

1848
01:47:44,150 --> 01:47:46,290
the way,
because a few days before when Austria,

1849
01:47:46,291 --> 01:47:49,950
Hungary declares war on Serbia,
the markets around the world,

1850
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:51,210
you know,
go crazy,

1851
01:47:51,810 --> 01:47:54,030
and in London,
the financial capital of the world,

1852
01:47:54,090 --> 01:47:59,090
Lloyd George is hearing from all the 
bankers and all the investors and all 

1853
01:47:59,090 --> 01:48:01,230
these people that this is a crisis.
It will destroy Britain fiscally,

1854
01:48:01,231 --> 01:48:06,231
which sounds like the worst thing in the
world until you fast forward the time 

1855
01:48:06,231 --> 01:48:07,320
machine for years and see what's really 
going to happen,

1856
01:48:07,620 --> 01:48:12,620
where you would have paid good money to 
only have the financial system 

1857
01:48:12,620 --> 01:48:13,200
collapsed.
Here's the thing though,

1858
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:18,620
there were people who turned out to be 
right about how momentous this leap off 

1859
01:48:18,721 --> 01:48:20,940
this cliff and how long the drop was 
going to be,

1860
01:48:21,150 --> 01:48:24,150
who turned out to be right and we're 
kind of hoping for it.

1861
01:48:24,150 --> 01:48:25,890
I mean,
take for example,

1862
01:48:26,310 --> 01:48:29,730
the guy who along with Karl Marx helped 
create modern communism.

1863
01:48:29,731 --> 01:48:34,731
Friedrich Engels who in 18,
87 wrote about this coming conflict and 

1864
01:48:34,731 --> 01:48:39,471
how terrible it was going to be,
and of course you know in his mind 

1865
01:48:39,471 --> 01:48:43,670
hoping for an overthrow of all the 
existing regimes to be replaced by 

1866
01:48:43,670 --> 01:48:47,241
communism.
That was sort of the silver lining in 

1867
01:48:47,241 --> 01:48:47,850
this coming armageddon.
Engels wrote quote,

1868
01:48:48,780 --> 01:48:53,100
I see a world war of never before seen 
extension and intensity.

1869
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:57,660
If the system of mutual outbidding in 
armament carried to the extreme,

1870
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:02,840
finally bears it's natural fruits,
eight to 10 million soldiers will 

1871
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:06,831
slaughter each other and strip you're a 
bear as no swarm of locusts has ever 

1872
01:49:06,831 --> 01:49:09,870
done before.
The devastations of the 30 years' war,

1873
01:49:10,050 --> 01:49:13,890
condensed into three or four years and 
spread all over the continent.

1874
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:15,600
Famine,
epidemics,

1875
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:20,780
General Barbara,
realization of armies and masses 

1876
01:49:20,780 --> 01:49:23,120
provoked by sheer desperation,
utter chaos in our trade industry and 

1877
01:49:23,120 --> 01:49:27,921
commerce ending in general bankruptcy 
collapse of the old states in their 

1878
01:49:27,921 --> 01:49:32,031
traditional wisdom in such a way that 
the crowns role in the gutter by the 

1879
01:49:32,031 --> 01:49:33,990
dozens and there'll be nobody to pick 
them up.

1880
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:39,380
Absolute impossibility to foresee how 
all this will end and who will be the 

1881
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:40,770
victors in that struggle.
Only one result,

1882
01:49:40,771 --> 01:49:45,771
absolutely certain general exhaustion 
and the creation of circumstances for 

1883
01:49:45,771 --> 01:49:49,120
the final victory of the working and 
quote,

1884
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:54,750
so there's your silver lining.
If you happen to be a communist 

1885
01:49:54,750 --> 01:49:57,211
revolutionary and you want to see the 
overthrow of governments and in one 

1886
01:49:57,211 --> 01:49:58,600
sense angles will get what he wants,
at least in one country,

1887
01:49:59,530 --> 01:50:01,450
but he's not the only person that 
precedes this.

1888
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:03,940
Some of the best military minds of the 
time.

1889
01:50:03,941 --> 01:50:08,941
See it too.
We've told you about the field marshal 

1890
01:50:08,941 --> 01:50:10,420
in charge of Germany's war effort,
the man known as von Moltke,

1891
01:50:11,110 --> 01:50:16,110
but he is a pale shadow of his uncle,
the man known as the elder von Moltke,

1892
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:22,920
who commanded Prussian forces in the 
Franco Prussian war of 1878 slash 71 by 

1893
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:27,391
this time period.
He's retired and he's on the speaking 

1894
01:50:27,391 --> 01:50:30,001
circuit in 1906.
He speaks to the German legislature and 

1895
01:50:30,001 --> 01:50:32,020
he warns them what a modern war is going
to be like.

1896
01:50:34,090 --> 01:50:38,860
The age of cabinet war is behind us.
All we have now is people's war.

1897
01:50:39,070 --> 01:50:44,070
Gentlemen,
if the war that has been hanging over 

1898
01:50:44,070 --> 01:50:44,500
our heads now for more than 10 years,
like the sword of Damocles,

1899
01:50:44,740 --> 01:50:49,740
if this war breaks out,
then its duration and its end will be 

1900
01:50:49,740 --> 01:50:52,951
unforeseeable,
the greatest powers of Europe armed as 

1901
01:50:52,951 --> 01:50:55,981
never before,
we'll be going into battle with each 

1902
01:50:55,981 --> 01:50:58,621
other,
not one of them can be crushed so 

1903
01:50:58,621 --> 01:50:58,810
completely in one or two campaigns that 
it will admit defeat,

1904
01:50:59,050 --> 01:51:04,050
that it will be compelled to conclude 
piece under hard terms and that it will 

1905
01:51:04,050 --> 01:51:05,830
not come back even if it is a year later
to renew the struggle.

1906
01:51:06,070 --> 01:51:11,070
Gentlemen,
it may be a wharf seven years or 30 

1907
01:51:11,070 --> 01:51:12,640
years duration and woe to him who sets 
Europe a light,

1908
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:17,140
who first puts the fuse to the powder 
keg and quote,

1909
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:24,060
this long drop in the dark is going to 
set up the first.

1910
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:26,500
If you want to use the boxing analogy 
again,

1911
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:31,740
the first heavyweight championship fight
the world has seen since Napoleon stay 

1912
01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:33,790
100 years before.
In the interim,

1913
01:51:33,791 --> 01:51:35,090
you've had a lot of,
you know,

1914
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:38,980
one sided conflicts.
You know a champion like Muhammad Ali or

1915
01:51:38,981 --> 01:51:41,920
Mike Tyson fighting a person you've 
never heard of,

1916
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:47,250
or you'll have something like the wars 
between the United States and Spain over

1917
01:51:47,771 --> 01:51:50,980
Cuba and the Philippines,
which is a rising soon to be first class

1918
01:51:50,981 --> 01:51:55,981
power against a declining soon to be 
third class power or these great 

1919
01:51:55,981 --> 01:51:59,911
colonial conflicts.
We're a nation like Britain will go in 

1920
01:51:59,911 --> 01:52:02,740
and crush the dervishes or the Zulus 
with the occasional setback of course,

1921
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:06,640
and they will use machine guns against 
these natives.

1922
01:52:06,641 --> 01:52:09,640
Armed with spears,
one of these machine guns,

1923
01:52:09,641 --> 01:52:14,641
really a gatling gun was called the 
maximum gun and there was a famous 

1924
01:52:14,641 --> 01:52:16,480
colonial era poem that said,
whatever happens,

1925
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:21,510
we have got the maximum gun and they 
have not in this upcoming war.

1926
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:24,790
Both sides will have the maximum gun.
In fact,

1927
01:52:24,970 --> 01:52:29,970
much more deadly modern versions of the 
maxim gun that we call machine guns 

1928
01:52:29,970 --> 01:52:34,081
today.
No one had ever seen a war where both 

1929
01:52:34,081 --> 01:52:36,991
sides had machine guns.
The Franco Prussian war saw the French 

1930
01:52:36,991 --> 01:52:40,471
trying to use these gatling guns,
these early machine guns as best they 

1931
01:52:40,471 --> 01:52:44,281
could,
but no one really had any clue what to 

1932
01:52:44,281 --> 01:52:44,281
do with them.
That had all changed by 1914.

1933
01:52:44,410 --> 01:52:48,710
We were seeing most professional armies 
perhaps that the world had ever seen and

1934
01:52:48,711 --> 01:52:50,930
certainly the largest that the world had
ever seen,

1935
01:52:51,260 --> 01:52:56,260
getting ready to clash in a conflict 
that was going to be like jumping off a 

1936
01:52:56,260 --> 01:52:59,870
cliff in the dark.
Nobody could foresee the end of this.

1937
01:53:00,320 --> 01:53:05,320
One thing was for sure the army for 
Germany that is about to enter Belgium 

1938
01:53:06,650 --> 01:53:11,650
is probably the greatest army that the 
world had seen up until that time,

1939
01:53:14,510 --> 01:53:18,300
and I say that with everyone knowing 
what a big fan I am of the Mongol,

1940
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:22,790
a military science and history and their
armies and they're wonderful,

1941
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:28,360
but they get respect.
People understand how incredibly 

1942
01:53:28,360 --> 01:53:31,751
dominant the Mongols were.
The army of Germany during this time 

1943
01:53:31,751 --> 01:53:31,751
period,
the Kaiser,

1944
01:53:31,751 --> 01:53:36,341
right?
This is like the Rodney Dangerfield of 

1945
01:53:36,341 --> 01:53:36,341
armies.
They don't get any respect,

1946
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:39,350
and yet they are maybe.
I mean,

1947
01:53:39,351 --> 01:53:43,310
you create your top 10 list of the 
greatest armies throughout all history,

1948
01:53:43,311 --> 01:53:44,990
and I put the Kaiser Right Carme on 
there.

1949
01:53:45,290 --> 01:53:50,290
I'm not sure I put the German army from 
the Second World War on there and yet 

1950
01:53:50,290 --> 01:53:52,280
part of the reason we don't know more 
about that first World War German armies

1951
01:53:52,281 --> 01:53:53,870
because the Second World War German 
army,

1952
01:53:53,871 --> 01:53:58,340
like so many things in that second 
conflict overshadow it in many ways.

1953
01:53:58,670 --> 01:54:03,670
The Wehrmacht in the Second World War is
flashier than the first World War German

1954
01:54:03,831 --> 01:54:05,170
army,
you know,

1955
01:54:05,330 --> 01:54:10,330
once again,
to get to the box and character 

1956
01:54:10,330 --> 01:54:11,861
Richard's the Wehrmacht is a big heavy 
hitter knockout artist and they go 

1957
01:54:11,861 --> 01:54:14,090
around and it's just boom,
it's over in one round sometimes and you

1958
01:54:14,091 --> 01:54:15,890
stand up and it's thrilling and 
incredible,

1959
01:54:15,891 --> 01:54:20,891
but you know,
once someone hits them back or or beats 

1960
01:54:20,891 --> 01:54:21,500
them up a little,
it's a different game and once you start

1961
01:54:21,501 --> 01:54:26,501
wearing them down,
now you can continue to wear them down 

1962
01:54:26,501 --> 01:54:26,501
because they're not strong.

1963
01:54:26,501 --> 01:54:28,670
Fundamentally at the core,
they have a great punch,

1964
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:32,480
but they rest sort of on an uneven 
foundation.

1965
01:54:33,380 --> 01:54:37,100
That was really where the strength of 
the first World War army was.

1966
01:54:37,430 --> 01:54:40,400
It may not have been as flashy with 
those giant knockouts and all that,

1967
01:54:40,401 --> 01:54:42,950
but they had a better chin and they 
were,

1968
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:45,050
you know,
they rested on from foundations.

1969
01:54:45,051 --> 01:54:49,660
It was a fantastic army and no one 
remembers it today,

1970
01:54:49,661 --> 01:54:54,661
and what's funny is once again,
it just becomes another thing that I'd 

1971
01:54:54,661 --> 01:54:56,410
off Hitler was wrong about when he 
wrote,

1972
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:59,590
quote,
thousands of years may pass,

1973
01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:04,180
but never will it be possible to speak 
of heroism without mentioning the German

1974
01:55:04,181 --> 01:55:07,600
army in the world war.
Then from the veil of the past,

1975
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:12,720
the iron front of the gray steel helmet 
will emerge unwavering and unflinching 

1976
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,450
and immortal monument as long as there 
are Germans alive.

1977
01:55:16,570 --> 01:55:19,420
They will remember that these men were 
sons of their nation.

1978
01:55:20,370 --> 01:55:20,920
And to quote,

1979
01:55:22,670 --> 01:55:27,670
it's a fantastic army and part of what 
makes it so great is this natural 

1980
01:55:28,161 --> 01:55:31,280
efficiency that was almost 
stereotypically German,

1981
01:55:31,700 --> 01:55:36,700
is applied to military science during a 
time period where military science 

1982
01:55:36,700 --> 01:55:40,910
really does become science.
It's become the age of the bean counters

1983
01:55:40,911 --> 01:55:44,460
and efficiency experts when it comes to 
putting an army in the field.

1984
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:49,470
That's what the Napoleonic era creates,
where you get this first part of the war

1985
01:55:49,471 --> 01:55:51,810
machine,
the ability to create these mass armies.

1986
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:57,380
Now imagine a guy like Alexander the 
great who I love to mention all the 

1987
01:55:57,380 --> 01:56:00,681
time,
but you can imagine Julius Caesar to 

1988
01:56:00,681 --> 01:56:00,900
guys who probably never commanded more 
than 80,000

1989
01:56:00,901 --> 01:56:05,901
people ever and who staffs,
you know we're capable and they could 

1990
01:56:05,901 --> 01:56:09,591
deal with it and they were very 
efficient logistically and everything 

1991
01:56:09,591 --> 01:56:10,770
for their time period,
but they were dealing with 80,000

1992
01:56:10,771 --> 01:56:15,771
men in this era.
You're dealing with 12 to 15 times that 

1993
01:56:17,581 --> 01:56:18,060
amount.

1994
01:56:18,540 --> 01:56:20,460
What would alexander the great had done 
trying to,

1995
01:56:20,730 --> 01:56:22,920
you know,
control one and a half million men.

1996
01:56:23,310 --> 01:56:27,930
It's an exercise in higher math to try 
to do that.

1997
01:56:28,170 --> 01:56:33,090
And when you hear about how the Germans 
had prepared minute Lee for this day,

1998
01:56:33,091 --> 01:56:38,091
that for so long had been called the day
dare tog this attack into Belgium into 

1999
01:56:38,161 --> 01:56:43,161
overwhelm friends and everything.
You get an idea of how much actual bean 

2000
01:56:43,161 --> 01:56:46,260
counting and planning is involved now in
order to maintain these armies.

2001
01:56:46,261 --> 01:56:51,261
That would have been impossible 150 
years before because this capability 

2002
01:56:51,261 --> 01:56:51,730
didn't exist.
It's,

2003
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:56,400
it's a function of modern civilization 
and the era of the 20th century.

2004
01:56:57,510 --> 01:56:59,940
Now you get an idea of size.
You have to think about the division,

2005
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:03,690
which is the basic unit that these 
militaries kinda operate with.

2006
01:57:03,910 --> 01:57:08,910
It goes back to Napoleonic times.
Divisions are still used of course in 

2007
01:57:08,910 --> 01:57:10,230
military is today,
and if you want to think about 15,000

2008
01:57:10,231 --> 01:57:12,600
men in a division as a kind of a rough 
size,

2009
01:57:12,601 --> 01:57:14,970
it actually fluctuates in different 
militaries and whatnot,

2010
01:57:14,971 --> 01:57:16,320
but just think 15,000
men,

2011
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:20,730
a $15,000
million division is probably more troops

2012
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:23,820
than either the normans or the saxons 
had at the battle of hastings,

2013
01:57:23,821 --> 01:57:28,821
the pivotal 10,
66 panel that decided the fate of 

2014
01:57:28,821 --> 01:57:28,821
Britain at the time,
England at the time.

2015
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:34,610
So each division,
this is equivalent to a rather nice 

2016
01:57:34,610 --> 01:57:37,491
sized early medieval army.
The German army at the beginning of the 

2017
01:57:37,491 --> 01:57:41,691
war has more than 80 of these.
Imagine trying to control 80 norman 

2018
01:57:41,691 --> 01:57:44,970
armies and it's not just about getting 
each division where it needs to go.

2019
01:57:45,150 --> 01:57:47,760
It's about sinking what they do 
together.

2020
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,360
When you start organizing divisions and 
two cores and cores into armies,

2021
01:57:51,630 --> 01:57:53,550
then these armies have to support each 
other.

2022
01:57:53,640 --> 01:57:58,640
They have to travel on different roads 
and then converge at certain points and 

2023
01:57:58,640 --> 01:58:02,181
you have to think of the incredible math
that's involved in these march columns 

2024
01:58:02,181 --> 01:58:05,661
and it's hard to get your mind around,
but these units are so large and these 

2025
01:58:05,661 --> 01:58:07,320
roads so narrow that when the head of 
the column starts walking,

2026
01:58:07,650 --> 01:58:12,650
they've gone like 29 miles before the 
end of the column can start walking.

2027
01:58:13,590 --> 01:58:18,590
Trying to plan to have food ready for 
these guys when they stopped marching 

2028
01:58:18,590 --> 01:58:22,161
and I mean it's the logistics of this is
incredible and it's the main reason why 

2029
01:58:22,161 --> 01:58:23,490
you couldn't do this,
you know,

2030
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:24,840
ages and ages ago.

2031
01:58:24,840 --> 01:58:29,840
You just couldn't support it.
In addition to all these armies are 

2032
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:33,141
fabulously trained.
The Germans are incredibly trained in 

2033
01:58:33,141 --> 01:58:36,411
terms of having even they're reservists 
on the practice fields in Germany doing 

2034
01:58:37,051 --> 01:58:40,140
live fire exercises.
Preparing for this day.

2035
01:58:41,530 --> 01:58:43,030
This is what Barbara Tuchman writes 
about,

2036
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:48,220
you know,
it starts with mobilization and you get 

2037
01:58:48,220 --> 01:58:48,880
an idea of how planned every step is.
In the German army quote,

2038
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:54,130
once the mobilization button was pushed,
the whole vast machinery for calling up,

2039
01:58:54,250 --> 01:58:59,250
equipping and transporting,
2 million men began turning 

2040
01:58:59,250 --> 01:59:02,821
automatically.
Reservists went to their designated 

2041
01:59:02,821 --> 01:59:02,821
Depos,
were issued uniforms,

2042
01:59:02,821 --> 01:59:07,620
equipment and arms formed into companies
and companies into battalions were 

2043
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:09,340
joined by cavalry,
cyclists,

2044
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:11,260
artillery,
medical units,

2045
01:59:11,350 --> 01:59:13,420
cook wagons,
blacksmith wagons,

2046
01:59:13,450 --> 01:59:18,450
even postal wagons moved according to 
prepared railway timetables to 

2047
01:59:18,450 --> 01:59:23,431
concentration points near the frontier 
where they would be formed into 

2048
01:59:23,431 --> 01:59:23,431
divisions,
divisions,

2049
01:59:23,431 --> 01:59:26,590
into cores and cores into armies,
ready to advance and fight.

2050
01:59:26,980 --> 01:59:31,180
One Army Corps alone,
she writes out of the total of 40 in the

2051
01:59:31,181 --> 01:59:36,181
German forces,
required a hundred and 70 railway cars 

2052
01:59:36,181 --> 01:59:38,530
for officers,
965 for infantry,

2053
01:59:38,680 --> 01:59:41,470
2,960
for cavalry.

2054
01:59:41,650 --> 01:59:45,640
Nineteen hundred and 15 for artillery 
and supply wagons.

2055
01:59:45,790 --> 01:59:50,710
Six thousand and 10 in all grouped in 
140 trains and an equal number.

2056
01:59:50,711 --> 01:59:53,980
Again for their supplies.
From the moment the order was given,

2057
01:59:53,981 --> 01:59:58,981
she writes,
everything was to move at fixed times 

2058
01:59:58,981 --> 02:00:02,041
according to a schedule precise down to 
the number of train axles that would 

2059
02:00:02,041 --> 02:00:03,550
pass over a given bridge within a given 
time.

2060
02:00:04,260 --> 02:00:09,260
And to quote,
when you realize how my noodly planned 

2061
02:00:09,430 --> 02:00:11,350
and how you know,
punctual,

2062
02:00:11,351 --> 02:00:14,020
this whole thing must be in order to 
function.

2063
02:00:14,230 --> 02:00:16,900
You can see why delays of even a few 
hours.

2064
02:00:16,901 --> 02:00:19,150
We'll throw your whole timetable off.
You know,

2065
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:20,830
right before this whole conflict breaks 
out,

2066
02:00:20,831 --> 02:00:25,831
and I mentioned it earlier,
the Kaiser will turn to von Moltke and 

2067
02:00:25,831 --> 02:00:25,831
he's panicking at the last minute.

2068
02:00:25,831 --> 02:00:28,780
The Great Supreme Warrior leaders,
not so tough when it all looks like it's

2069
02:00:28,781 --> 02:00:31,660
coming down.
Unfortunately for him or fortunately for

2070
02:00:31,661 --> 02:00:34,210
him,
the staff that works under him are tough

2071
02:00:34,211 --> 02:00:35,050
as nails.
Again,

2072
02:00:35,051 --> 02:00:37,660
another thing is German army,
this period brought to the table,

2073
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:40,870
which to be honest,
the second one did most of the time too.

2074
02:00:41,140 --> 02:00:46,140
It's fantastic leadership and the Kaiser
at one point thinks the war was 

2075
02:00:46,140 --> 02:00:46,140
Britain's off and he says,
great,

2076
02:00:46,140 --> 02:00:47,620
we can turn the armies around,
you know,

2077
02:00:47,621 --> 02:00:52,621
just send them to Russia instead of 
worrying about France and England at 

2078
02:00:52,621 --> 02:00:52,621
all,
and von Moltke has to stop him and say,

2079
02:00:52,621 --> 02:00:55,840
you do not improvise the deployment of 
millions.

2080
02:00:57,040 --> 02:01:02,040
I think the exact line was the 
deployment of millions cannot be 

2081
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:02,040
improvised,
but you get the point.

2082
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:07,020
This was a,
an efficient plan to deploy the largest 

2083
02:01:07,020 --> 02:01:11,200
number of people that had ever been sent
in a single area for a single purpose.

2084
02:01:11,200 --> 02:01:16,200
Probably in all human history.
You think about Napoleon's greatest 

2085
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:18,850
outrageous gamble,
right?

2086
02:01:18,851 --> 02:01:22,510
To invade Russia,
utilizing an army composed of many,

2087
02:01:22,511 --> 02:01:24,820
many,
many different European peoples.

2088
02:01:24,970 --> 02:01:27,040
You know,
he had to scrape Germany and every place

2089
02:01:27,041 --> 02:01:32,041
else to get enough people to send into 
Russia with something that was called 

2090
02:01:32,041 --> 02:01:32,041
the grand army.
You know,

2091
02:01:32,041 --> 02:01:36,991
in the early 18 hundreds,
and it was this crazy endeavor sent 

2092
02:01:36,991 --> 02:01:40,650
maybe 750,000
men into the Germans were going to 

2093
02:01:40,971 --> 02:01:45,500
invade Belgium with more than twice that
in and outflanking maneuver.

2094
02:01:46,190 --> 02:01:48,020
That's not even the army.
That's holding the front,

2095
02:01:48,110 --> 02:01:51,320
that's just a big wide swinging gate 
that's going to smash on top of the head

2096
02:01:51,321 --> 02:01:55,190
of France.
How do you control that many people?

2097
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:57,830
How do you even get them from one place 
to another?

2098
02:01:57,831 --> 02:02:01,340
We kind of seem to think in our head 
that they can just march across,

2099
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:06,500
you know,
mountain sides and country lanes and 

2100
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:06,620
through fields and pastures and 
sometimes they do,

2101
02:02:06,950 --> 02:02:11,060
but most of the time they get to places 
the same way most of us do.

2102
02:02:11,270 --> 02:02:16,270
They utilize the road system.
Think about what the road system in 

2103
02:02:16,270 --> 02:02:17,450
Belgium,
tiny little,

2104
02:02:17,750 --> 02:02:22,750
mostly rural Belgium is going to be like
with this massive greatest sized army 

2105
02:02:23,331 --> 02:02:28,331
probably ever put together trying to 
march through it all in a short period 

2106
02:02:28,331 --> 02:02:30,620
of time.
There were witnesses,

2107
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:32,570
of course,
to this actually happening.

2108
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:38,800
One of the fun ones to read for me is 
Richard Harding Davis because Davis is 

2109
02:02:39,381 --> 02:02:41,060
one of those guys.
He's an American.

2110
02:02:41,330 --> 02:02:42,180
He also,
you know,

2111
02:02:42,190 --> 02:02:44,210
he's basically the war correspondent,
uh,

2112
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:49,240
one of the main ones of his era and he 
wrote about the deployment of American 

2113
02:02:49,240 --> 02:02:49,260
forces in Cuba.
You know,

2114
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:51,140
at the turn of the century and all this 
kind of stuff and he's,

2115
02:02:51,290 --> 02:02:54,770
he's really a Rah Rah America Kinda guy.
You know,

2116
02:02:54,771 --> 02:02:57,410
Americans the best at everything and,
and that sort of feeling.

2117
02:02:57,950 --> 02:03:02,950
But he was there in Belgium as the 
German army comes through and you can,

2118
02:03:03,620 --> 02:03:08,620
I mean,
I'm going to read you this extensively 

2119
02:03:08,620 --> 02:03:10,781
because you can hear in his writing,
his jaw is on the floor and here's 

2120
02:03:10,851 --> 02:03:15,851
someone who doesn't think anybody does 
anything better than America and he's 

2121
02:03:15,851 --> 02:03:19,160
getting a lesson in what the best army 
in the world looks like.

2122
02:03:19,550 --> 02:03:24,550
And remember this kind of force at this 
kind of level and potency hasn't been on

2123
02:03:24,771 --> 02:03:29,570
display in anyone's living memory.
You're getting a view of a nation at war

2124
02:03:29,571 --> 02:03:34,571
like you in Napoleonic times,
but marched and equipped and organized 

2125
02:03:34,571 --> 02:03:36,560
and supported by a modern 20th century 
state.

2126
02:03:36,561 --> 02:03:41,561
This was while you were beginning to see
a tiny little glimmer of what the leap 

2127
02:03:41,561 --> 02:03:46,541
in the dark was going to entail.
It was going to entail fighting armies 

2128
02:03:46,541 --> 02:03:48,890
like this one.
Richard Harding Davis writes,

2129
02:03:48,891 --> 02:03:53,891
quote,
the entrance of the German army into 

2130
02:03:53,891 --> 02:03:56,730
Brussels has lost the human quality.
It was lost as soon as the three 

2131
02:03:56,730 --> 02:03:59,330
soldiers who led the army bicycled into 
the boulevard,

2132
02:03:59,331 --> 02:04:04,331
do resent and ask the wage of the ged 
ignored when they passed the human note 

2133
02:04:04,331 --> 02:04:07,970
past with them what came after them,
and 24 hours later,

2134
02:04:07,971 --> 02:04:10,760
it's still coming,
is not men marching,

2135
02:04:11,030 --> 02:04:14,930
but a force of nature like a tidal wave,
an avalanche,

2136
02:04:15,020 --> 02:04:17,900
or a river flooding it's banks at this 
minute.

2137
02:04:17,900 --> 02:04:22,900
It is rolling through Brussels as the 
swollen waters of the valleys swept 

2138
02:04:22,900 --> 02:04:25,700
through Johnstown at the site of the 
first few regiments of the enemy.

2139
02:04:25,730 --> 02:04:28,280
He writes,
we were thrilled with interest.

2140
02:04:28,610 --> 02:04:33,610
After three hours,
they had passed in one unbroken steel 

2141
02:04:33,610 --> 02:04:33,710
gray column.
We were bored,

2142
02:04:34,070 --> 02:04:37,010
but when hour after hour passed and 
there was no,

2143
02:04:37,710 --> 02:04:41,280
no breathing time,
no open spaces in the ranks.

2144
02:04:41,430 --> 02:04:44,310
The thing became uncanny,
inhuman.

2145
02:04:44,580 --> 02:04:46,740
You returned to watch it,
fascinated.

2146
02:04:46,950 --> 02:04:51,950
It held the mystery and menace of fog 
rolling towards you across the sea and 

2147
02:04:51,950 --> 02:04:56,941
quote.
He then goes on to describe the 

2148
02:04:56,941 --> 02:04:57,210
uniforms,
which are pretty much the same color.

2149
02:04:57,211 --> 02:05:00,250
The Second World War German uniforms are
felled Grau,

2150
02:05:00,251 --> 02:05:01,950
I guess is the proper way to pronounce 
it,

2151
02:05:01,951 --> 02:05:05,730
but basically it's just a gray,
but during this time period,

2152
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:09,810
most nations had only relatively 
recently gone away from Gadi,

2153
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:11,700
colorful clothing,
you know,

2154
02:05:11,701 --> 02:05:16,701
bright red scarlet for British troops 
has only recently given away to khaki 

2155
02:05:16,701 --> 02:05:21,080
and the French army still war stuff that
looked like they belong in Napoleon's 

2156
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:21,080
army,
right?

2157
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:25,520
They're going to wear red pants and blue
jackets and they're going to carry 

2158
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:30,441
savers and their calvary is going to 
have breast plates and horse hair 

2159
02:05:30,441 --> 02:05:30,441
helmets.
I mean,

2160
02:05:30,441 --> 02:05:33,801
it's Kooky stuff.
Most militaries are moving away from 

2161
02:05:33,801 --> 02:05:36,591
that.
The German's use of gray harting thinks 

2162
02:05:36,591 --> 02:05:39,240
is the most fantastic use of camouflage 
she's ever seen.

2163
02:05:40,020 --> 02:05:43,950
The British Khaki is often compared to a
coronary that's gotten.

2164
02:05:43,951 --> 02:05:48,951
Dusty Davis goes on and on about how the
minute these German soldiers get 100 

2165
02:05:49,861 --> 02:05:51,690
yards from you,
you can't see him anymore.

2166
02:05:51,780 --> 02:05:56,780
He says he was watching some German 
cavalry would ride by and he could see 

2167
02:05:56,780 --> 02:05:59,841
the horses,
but he couldn't see the guys on them 

2168
02:05:59,841 --> 02:06:01,671
because they just sort of blend with the
fog and the mist and the twilight and 

2169
02:06:01,671 --> 02:06:05,271
the early morning hours in that color.
If he goes on and on about how great 

2170
02:06:05,271 --> 02:06:08,040
that is and how scientific it is,
he goes on quote yesterday,

2171
02:06:08,041 --> 02:06:09,630
Major Gen Vaughan,
Zeratsky,

2172
02:06:09,631 --> 02:06:11,580
the German military governor of 
Brussels,

2173
02:06:11,820 --> 02:06:16,820
assured burger master Max,
that the German army would not occupy 

2174
02:06:16,820 --> 02:06:17,130
the city but would pass through it.

2175
02:06:17,490 --> 02:06:21,660
It is still passing.
I have followed in campaigns six armies,

2176
02:06:21,870 --> 02:06:25,410
but accepting not even our own,
the Japanese or the British.

2177
02:06:25,680 --> 02:06:27,870
I have not seen one so thoroughly 
equipped.

2178
02:06:28,050 --> 02:06:30,540
I'm not speaking of the fighting 
qualities of any army,

2179
02:06:30,750 --> 02:06:35,750
only have the equipment in organization.
The German army moved into this city as 

2180
02:06:35,750 --> 02:06:38,730
smoothly and as compactly as the Empire 
State Express,

2181
02:06:38,910 --> 02:06:41,220
there were no halts,
no open places,

2182
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:43,710
no stragglers.
This army he writes,

2183
02:06:43,890 --> 02:06:48,030
has been on active service for three 
weeks and so far there is not apparently

2184
02:06:48,031 --> 02:06:53,031
a chin strap or a horseshoe missing.
It came in with the smoke pouring from 

2185
02:06:53,031 --> 02:06:57,681
cookstoves on wheels and in an hour had 
set up post office wagons from which 

2186
02:06:57,781 --> 02:07:02,130
Mountain Messengers galloped along the 
line of columns distributing letters and

2187
02:07:02,131 --> 02:07:04,710
at which soldiers posted picture 
postcards.

2188
02:07:04,890 --> 02:07:09,120
The infantry he writes,
came in files of five to 100 men to each

2189
02:07:09,121 --> 02:07:14,121
company,
the lancers in columns of four with not 

2190
02:07:14,121 --> 02:07:14,700
a pendant missing the quick firing.

2191
02:07:14,700 --> 02:07:18,690
Guns and field pieces were one hour at a
time in passing each gun.

2192
02:07:18,750 --> 02:07:23,280
It's ammunition wagon taking 20 seconds 
in which to pass the men of the infantry

2193
02:07:23,281 --> 02:07:28,281
saying,
father land my father land between each 

2194
02:07:28,281 --> 02:07:28,830
line of song.
They took three steps.

2195
02:07:29,070 --> 02:07:33,630
At times 2000 men were singing together 
and absolute rhythm and beat.

2196
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:37,180
When the melody gave way,
the silence was broken only by the stamp

2197
02:07:37,181 --> 02:07:40,570
of iron shod boots,
and then again the song rose.

2198
02:07:40,780 --> 02:07:43,660
When the singing ceased,
the bands played marches.

2199
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:46,210
They were followed by the rumble of 
siege guns,

2200
02:07:46,330 --> 02:07:51,330
the creaking of wheels and have chains 
clanking against the cobblestones and 

2201
02:07:51,330 --> 02:07:54,160
the sharp bell like voices of the Bugles
for seven hours.

2202
02:07:54,161 --> 02:07:59,161
The army passed in such solid columns 
that not once might have taxi cab or 

2203
02:07:59,161 --> 02:08:01,780
trolley car passed through the city like
a river of steel.

2204
02:08:01,781 --> 02:08:05,770
It flowed gray and ghostlike.
Then as dusk came in,

2205
02:08:05,771 --> 02:08:10,771
as thousands of horses hooves and 
thousands of iron boots continued to 

2206
02:08:10,771 --> 02:08:14,701
tramp forward,
they struck tiny sparks from the 

2207
02:08:14,701 --> 02:08:17,641
cobblestones,
but the horses and men who beat out the 

2208
02:08:17,641 --> 02:08:17,710
sparks were invisible.
At midnight,

2209
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:20,410
pack wagons and siege guns were still 
passing.

2210
02:08:20,620 --> 02:08:25,620
At seven this morning,
I was awakened by the tramp of men in 

2211
02:08:25,620 --> 02:08:26,770
bands playing jauntily.
Whether they marched all night or not,

2212
02:08:26,771 --> 02:08:29,650
I do not know,
but now for 26 hours,

2213
02:08:29,651 --> 02:08:34,651
the gray army has rumbled by with the 
mystery of fog and the purchase of a 

2214
02:08:34,651 --> 02:08:35,290
steam roller.

2215
02:08:35,890 --> 02:08:39,550
And to quote that was a long quote,
but that's.

2216
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:43,420
That's the German army of the Kaiser,
right on campaign,

2217
02:08:43,660 --> 02:08:48,660
the German army and the Second World War
is that country's best attempt to 

2218
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:53,060
recreate that.
No,

2219
02:08:53,061 --> 02:08:58,061
I've always believed that the very 
ferocity in the scariness of this Kaiser

2220
02:08:59,390 --> 02:09:04,390
Rack,
German army worked against it at the 

2221
02:09:04,390 --> 02:09:07,450
beginning of the war in a way that heard
it throughout the entire history of the 

2222
02:09:07,450 --> 02:09:11,240
war and I think long afterwards helped 
establish this German reputation as sort

2223
02:09:11,241 --> 02:09:15,180
of the bad guys because this army was so
intimidating,

2224
02:09:15,181 --> 02:09:20,181
so scary.
Everything from the precision drill to 

2225
02:09:20,181 --> 02:09:22,050
the equipment to how well organized they
were to the logistics,

2226
02:09:22,051 --> 02:09:27,051
to the leadership,
to the intimidating elements built into 

2227
02:09:27,051 --> 02:09:30,231
it.
I mean they had a wonderful a unit 

2228
02:09:30,231 --> 02:09:31,650
called the death's head has SARS,
which goes back to,

2229
02:09:31,970 --> 02:09:36,970
you know the Napoleonic wars earlier 
actually and they were the old fashioned

2230
02:09:37,051 --> 02:09:39,780
Hassan for helmet.
This is in 1914 folks.

2231
02:09:39,781 --> 02:09:44,781
This isn't an 18 tend the for helmet of 
the CSRS and on the helmet is a skull.

2232
02:09:46,820 --> 02:09:49,910
Reminds you a little bit of the SS 
forces in the Second World War,

2233
02:09:49,911 --> 02:09:52,100
but it shows you that all of this 
predated.

2234
02:09:52,520 --> 02:09:53,720
You know,
what the Nazis did.

2235
02:09:53,721 --> 02:09:58,721
The Nazi's were just updating a lot of 
classic German traditions and in a lot 

2236
02:09:58,721 --> 02:09:59,780
of cases perverting them and sustaining 
them with blackness and everything,

2237
02:09:59,990 --> 02:10:04,990
but to deaths had his.
Ours are famous and intimidating as 

2238
02:10:04,990 --> 02:10:08,501
they're meant to be,
but then you take that really nasty for 

2239
02:10:08,501 --> 02:10:11,911
Roche's,
intimidating army that looks like it 

2240
02:10:11,911 --> 02:10:14,341
could take on anyone in the world and 
the first time you see him in action 

2241
02:10:14,341 --> 02:10:14,750
they're taking on,
God bless them.

2242
02:10:15,230 --> 02:10:19,120
The Belgians,
a tiny little neutral nation that's less

2243
02:10:19,121 --> 02:10:24,121
than 100 years old and has never fought 
a war in fact is so small and it's 

2244
02:10:24,371 --> 02:10:28,510
surrounded by great powers that they 
rationally figured out a long time ago.

2245
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:31,720
It doesn't matter how much effort they 
put into defense,

2246
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:33,760
they can't win.
You know,

2247
02:10:33,770 --> 02:10:38,770
the Belgians totally unprepared for 
warfare lose only a little bit faster 

2248
02:10:38,770 --> 02:10:41,090
than the Belgians obsessively prepared 
for warfare.

2249
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:47,960
They put their trust in these 
international agreements they had with 

2250
02:10:47,960 --> 02:10:47,960
people who are going to guarantee their 
security,

2251
02:10:47,960 --> 02:10:49,200
which is how this whole thing is 
happening anyway.

2252
02:10:49,230 --> 02:10:49,530
Right?

2253
02:10:51,720 --> 02:10:55,680
But they did build some defenses maybe 
as a sign that,

2254
02:10:56,160 --> 02:10:57,300
you know,
we can't kill you,

2255
02:10:57,301 --> 02:11:02,301
but we could hurt you and the defenses 
are really cool because it's really 

2256
02:11:02,301 --> 02:11:05,310
right in that period in human history.
We're fortifications,

2257
02:11:05,311 --> 02:11:08,850
forts reach,
sort of their high watermark.

2258
02:11:08,910 --> 02:11:12,540
I mean we still build for today,
but it's nothing like it was what pretty

2259
02:11:12,541 --> 02:11:15,720
much from the beginning of your human 
history until.

2260
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:21,160
Well about the time we're talking about 
here because then you could base an 

2261
02:11:21,160 --> 02:11:23,400
entire defense strategy on Ford's.
Nowadays we have these special positions

2262
02:11:23,401 --> 02:11:28,401
where your guard them with a fort,
but if anybody decides they're going to 

2263
02:11:28,401 --> 02:11:28,401
start launching missiles and bombs and 
I'm.

2264
02:11:28,401 --> 02:11:29,670
It doesn't matter for us.
Don't hold up.

2265
02:11:30,540 --> 02:11:33,480
That's something we learn very soon in 
this story.

2266
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:36,240
But in the 18 eighties when these 
Belgian forts are built,

2267
02:11:36,870 --> 02:11:41,870
this is the period where it looks like 
modern tech is going to make these 

2268
02:11:41,870 --> 02:11:42,150
things like space age.

2269
02:11:42,180 --> 02:11:44,670
That's something out of Star Wars,
one of those planetary defenses.

2270
02:11:44,790 --> 02:11:48,330
And they build these wonderful 
subterranean forts.

2271
02:11:48,331 --> 02:11:51,990
Barbara Tuchman said like castles,
sunk underground.

2272
02:11:52,290 --> 02:11:53,430
And what they'll do is,
you know,

2273
02:11:53,431 --> 02:11:58,431
I'm reminded of the old,
a Godzilla films and the monster zero 

2274
02:11:58,431 --> 02:12:00,840
films where you'd have some planet and 
it would have a gun that would just rise

2275
02:12:00,841 --> 02:12:04,500
up from the planet surface shoot and 
then go back down under ground.

2276
02:12:04,501 --> 02:12:06,420
And that's what happened in these 
boards.

2277
02:12:07,020 --> 02:12:09,480
And I have to remind myself how cool 
that is.

2278
02:12:09,481 --> 02:12:14,481
This is like steam punk stuff because 
when they're building these forts for 

2279
02:12:14,481 --> 02:12:18,231
Belgium,
it's the same time that the United 

2280
02:12:18,231 --> 02:12:20,870
States and Mexico are trying to corral 
Geronimo and a bunch of Apaches in the 

2281
02:12:20,870 --> 02:12:21,690
American southwest while that's going 
on.

2282
02:12:21,870 --> 02:12:24,000
The Belgians are building underground 
forts.

2283
02:12:25,350 --> 02:12:26,970
And you can see some of the stuff on 
video.

2284
02:12:26,971 --> 02:12:31,971
If you look at the Maginot line,
which comes a generation after this 

2285
02:12:31,971 --> 02:12:31,971
obviously,
but it's the same kind of thing where,

2286
02:12:32,010 --> 02:12:33,930
you know,
if you look at it from above ground,

2287
02:12:33,931 --> 02:12:37,320
you can barely tell there's a fort there
when in fact underground,

2288
02:12:37,321 --> 02:12:39,380
you know,
massive concrete and you know,

2289
02:12:39,390 --> 02:12:42,420
little railroads underneath moving guns 
and ammunition around it.

2290
02:12:42,460 --> 02:12:43,350
It's,
it's cool stuff.

2291
02:12:43,351 --> 02:12:46,200
And the way the Belgian designer,
who was one of the best in the world,

2292
02:12:46,530 --> 02:12:51,530
built this system,
he took advantage of the natural river 

2293
02:12:51,530 --> 02:12:51,630
and the slight rise in the hill and 
everything in there.

2294
02:12:51,631 --> 02:12:56,631
And he built six big forts with six 
small fortune in between and they all 

2295
02:12:56,631 --> 02:12:58,940
cover each other's fields of fire with 
their guns.

2296
02:12:58,941 --> 02:13:02,460
So you know what for a can reach with 
their guns,

2297
02:13:02,461 --> 02:13:03,990
fort be can reach with,
there's two.

2298
02:13:03,990 --> 02:13:06,930
So they overlap.
So there's never a place in the distance

2299
02:13:06,931 --> 02:13:09,300
anyway where the guns can't reach the 
enemy.

2300
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:14,840
And in between these sports,
the Belgians have it so that they're 

2301
02:13:14,840 --> 02:13:16,380
going to put guys in trenches.
So between every Ford are people,

2302
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:18,750
they're supported by the guns.
It's this wonderful system.

2303
02:13:18,751 --> 02:13:21,240
And then you throw more troops out,
you know,

2304
02:13:21,241 --> 02:13:26,241
500 yards,
100 yards ahead to keep enemy artillery 

2305
02:13:26,241 --> 02:13:27,660
away.
And you have this system where maybe you

2306
02:13:27,661 --> 02:13:30,000
can't win a war against someone like the
Germans,

2307
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:32,940
which you give them a bloody nose and 
maybe say,

2308
02:13:32,941 --> 02:13:34,530
see you,
you really don't want to do this.

2309
02:13:34,590 --> 02:13:37,050
Um,
the Germans aren't sure about that.

2310
02:13:37,051 --> 02:13:42,051
And when they come into Belgium,
they're kind of thinking the Belgian 

2311
02:13:42,051 --> 02:13:42,660
armies either just going to stand aside,
like I said earlier,

2312
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:45,150
or maybe you know,
few shots up in the air.

2313
02:13:45,151 --> 02:13:46,110
We protected our honor.

2314
02:13:46,110 --> 02:13:51,110
Now we're going to stand aside.
And the first sign that the Germans are 

2315
02:13:51,110 --> 02:13:52,230
wrong about this is that the bridges are
blown up when they get to them,

2316
02:13:52,680 --> 02:13:57,680
the tunnels are blown up,
the railroads are blown up that Madden's

2317
02:13:58,831 --> 02:14:01,140
the Germans because they're on this 
tight schedule,

2318
02:14:01,141 --> 02:14:06,141
right?
So now they have to deal with at least 

2319
02:14:06,141 --> 02:14:09,921
transportation nightmares on this road 
system that was already going to be 

2320
02:14:09,921 --> 02:14:10,680
clogged terribly.
I mean there's your first nightmare.

2321
02:14:10,681 --> 02:14:15,681
And then the Germans tried to cross some
of these rivers on the frontier in 

2322
02:14:15,681 --> 02:14:16,080
pontoons and the Belgian start shooting 
at them.

2323
02:14:17,640 --> 02:14:22,640
So the Germans put into action a group 
that they have designed specifically to 

2324
02:14:23,611 --> 02:14:25,350
take these forts.
And this is the part of the story.

2325
02:14:25,351 --> 02:14:27,540
You have to understand where we are.
When war was declared,

2326
02:14:27,541 --> 02:14:32,541
you have like 72 hours where everybody's
trying to get their heads around this 

2327
02:14:32,541 --> 02:14:32,541
idea.

2328
02:14:32,541 --> 02:14:34,920
And at the same time they flipped all 
these switches for mobilization.

2329
02:14:34,921 --> 02:14:39,921
The doomsday device I called it where 
they're calling up all these forces and 

2330
02:14:39,921 --> 02:14:39,921
everybody,
you know,

2331
02:14:39,921 --> 02:14:43,671
we don't have enough stuff here and 
everybody's scrambling in what they 

2332
02:14:43,671 --> 02:14:45,120
assume is a race to the front lines,
which they don't want to lose.

2333
02:14:46,200 --> 02:14:48,960
Remember what if they gave a warrant?
Only one side came.

2334
02:14:49,890 --> 02:14:52,620
Meanwhile though,
while everybody is concentrating,

2335
02:14:52,621 --> 02:14:55,530
it's called their forces.
The Germans have like 30,000

2336
02:14:55,531 --> 02:15:00,531
guys that were set up in advance to go 
out basically in the pregame of the 

2337
02:15:00,531 --> 02:15:03,240
first World War,
I guess you could say and take out these

2338
02:15:03,241 --> 02:15:06,480
forts if they have to because these 
forts are blocking the roads.

2339
02:15:06,810 --> 02:15:10,380
You cannot get to that Belgian road 
system that you need to get from Germany

2340
02:15:10,381 --> 02:15:15,381
to France if you don't take the forts 
around a place like leanne or named 

2341
02:15:15,381 --> 02:15:15,381
Laura.

2342
02:15:15,780 --> 02:15:18,600
And so 30,000
men had been training for years for just

2343
02:15:18,601 --> 02:15:19,800
this job.
Like I said earlier,

2344
02:15:19,801 --> 02:15:24,801
the day was called der Tog the day this 
has been planned for for a long time.

2345
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:28,380
And the Germans have essentially a 
special unit of 30,000

2346
02:15:28,381 --> 02:15:30,390
guys whose job it is to take out these 
sports.

2347
02:15:30,391 --> 02:15:32,490
If the Belgians don't stand aside and 
surrender them,

2348
02:15:32,820 --> 02:15:34,820
the Belgians don't stand aside and 
surrender them.

2349
02:15:36,240 --> 02:15:41,240
And in fact the Belgians are going to 
teach the first great lesson of the war,

2350
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:47,340
about what's changed since the last 
time.

2351
02:15:47,341 --> 02:15:52,341
Great powers faced off how much the 
killing power that machine's afforded 

2352
02:15:54,031 --> 02:15:59,031
mankind on the battlefield.
How much that had changed the age old 

2353
02:15:59,031 --> 02:16:01,290
equation of war machines had been taken 
over for a long time,

2354
02:16:01,291 --> 02:16:06,291
becoming more and more important.
This is the war where they take over 

2355
02:16:06,291 --> 02:16:10,560
completely and man supremacy on the 
battlefield,

2356
02:16:10,650 --> 02:16:12,750
even though they're the ones who run the
machines,

2357
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:18,440
will always be now you know,
secondary compared to the killing power 

2358
02:16:18,440 --> 02:16:22,860
and mechanization that can be brought to
bear by modern societies.

2359
02:16:23,190 --> 02:16:28,190
The technology was devastating when used
against tribal peoples and nations that 

2360
02:16:29,111 --> 02:16:34,111
couldn't compete militarily.
The Belgians are going to show what a 

2361
02:16:34,111 --> 02:16:35,620
tiny little army of chocolate soldiers 
is.

2362
02:16:35,621 --> 02:16:37,540
What the Germans thought they were going
to face.

2363
02:16:37,690 --> 02:16:42,690
What a tiny little army of chocolate 
soldiers can do to the greatest army in 

2364
02:16:42,690 --> 02:16:43,180
the world because of the

2365
02:16:44,480 --> 02:16:46,400
deadliness of the weapons at hand,

2366
02:16:47,820 --> 02:16:52,820
and one of the interesting sort of sub 
themes of this whole upcoming conflict 

2367
02:16:52,820 --> 02:16:56,930
is how long it takes some people to 
absorb the lessons that are being taught

2368
02:16:58,021 --> 02:16:59,560
in this conflict.
You know,

2369
02:16:59,790 --> 02:17:04,790
lesson number one is how deadly the 
weapons are and how you have to account 

2370
02:17:04,790 --> 02:17:08,181
for that.
Some of the generals and military 

2371
02:17:08,181 --> 02:17:10,371
thinkers understood this going into the 
war because they had paid close 

2372
02:17:10,371 --> 02:17:10,371
attention to that 19,
oh,

2373
02:17:10,371 --> 02:17:12,120
five war I told you about the Russo 
Japanese war,

2374
02:17:12,420 --> 02:17:15,720
which by the way,
American President Teddy Roosevelt won a

2375
02:17:15,721 --> 02:17:18,600
Nobel prize for helping to broker the 
piece for that.

2376
02:17:19,230 --> 02:17:24,230
But that taught lessons about what 
happens when two sides armed with 

2377
02:17:24,230 --> 02:17:26,820
machine guns and two sides armed with 
modern artillery and all that face off.

2378
02:17:27,420 --> 02:17:30,750
But the lessons were not the kind of 
lesson some people wanted to learn.

2379
02:17:30,751 --> 02:17:33,000
I mean,
if you were a cavalry commander,

2380
02:17:33,001 --> 02:17:38,001
for example,
your arm of the military is already not 

2381
02:17:38,001 --> 02:17:38,760
looked upon as very survivable.

2382
02:17:39,060 --> 02:17:44,060
The war is all,
since Napoleon have kind of shown that 

2383
02:17:44,060 --> 02:17:44,340
listened cavalry just dies on the 
battlefield.

2384
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:47,640
The only thing that cavalry commander 
still have going in their favor is there

2385
02:17:47,641 --> 02:17:50,970
aren't really automobiles yet.
There will be by the time this was over,

2386
02:17:51,210 --> 02:17:53,730
but they're a novelty.
There'll be used in strange,

2387
02:17:53,731 --> 02:17:58,731
innovative situations,
but militaries of the world don't have 

2388
02:17:58,731 --> 02:17:58,731
tons of automobiles,
you know,

2389
02:17:58,731 --> 02:18:02,901
running.
It's not mechanized like the Second 

2390
02:18:02,901 --> 02:18:02,901
World War.
Everybody's using horses.

2391
02:18:02,901 --> 02:18:04,710
Even if they die on the battlefield,
you know,

2392
02:18:04,711 --> 02:18:09,711
like sheaves of wheat being sized down.
You have nothing to replace that 

2393
02:18:09,711 --> 02:18:13,281
mobility with.
But these cavalry commanders don't want 

2394
02:18:13,281 --> 02:18:13,281
to hear that.
It's even worse than it used to be.

2395
02:18:13,281 --> 02:18:17,480
Wow.
Wait until the modern artillery machine 

2396
02:18:17,480 --> 02:18:17,480
guns get ahold of your cavalry.
They don't want to hear that.

2397
02:18:17,480 --> 02:18:21,891
So they talk about the results as being 
unrepresentative commanders who were 

2398
02:18:21,891 --> 02:18:21,891
very,
um,

2399
02:18:22,700 --> 02:18:24,680
you know,
involved in the idea of the power of the

2400
02:18:24,681 --> 02:18:26,360
bayonet and the charge and the 
offensive.

2401
02:18:26,630 --> 02:18:31,630
For example,
the entire French outlook on war right 

2402
02:18:31,630 --> 02:18:34,271
now is connected to this idea that you 
attack and you know you attack with the 

2403
02:18:34,271 --> 02:18:35,450
band.
That doesn't really mean you're gonna,

2404
02:18:35,810 --> 02:18:40,810
maybe get into hand to hand combat,
but that aggressive style of warfare is 

2405
02:18:40,810 --> 02:18:41,300
what you want.
If you've been preaching that and that's

2406
02:18:41,301 --> 02:18:44,300
your country's doctrine and your entire 
military is organized around the culture

2407
02:18:44,301 --> 02:18:47,420
of the offensive and Cran,
which is the French word,

2408
02:18:47,421 --> 02:18:50,090
I guess for like guts and it's all about
guts.

2409
02:18:50,270 --> 02:18:52,850
Nobody wants to hear that machine guns 
just rip the guts out.

2410
02:18:52,880 --> 02:18:57,880
That's the only thing they care about 
guts and it doesn't work to have bang a 

2411
02:18:57,880 --> 02:18:58,940
net charges and ridiculous offensives.
Well,

2412
02:18:59,120 --> 02:19:00,590
the French would say,
yes,

2413
02:19:00,591 --> 02:19:05,591
well what doesn't work for the Russians 
or the Japanese will work for the 

2414
02:19:05,591 --> 02:19:06,350
French,
and that's why we have a great military.

2415
02:19:06,350 --> 02:19:08,300
I mean,
there's all kinds of ways to rationalize

2416
02:19:08,301 --> 02:19:13,301
what you don't want to learn.
Many of the militaries of the world are 

2417
02:19:13,301 --> 02:19:16,670
organized like Napoleonic Times.
They don't want to hear that.

2418
02:19:16,671 --> 02:19:19,040
That is a completely wrong way to be 
organized.

2419
02:19:19,041 --> 02:19:23,600
The French cavalry heading off to war,
as I said earlier,

2420
02:19:23,601 --> 02:19:28,601
but you have to imagine this,
if you want to see what Nepalian 

2421
02:19:28,601 --> 02:19:32,100
soldiers looked like,
go look at pictures of the French 

2422
02:19:32,100 --> 02:19:34,691
cavalry in 1914 going off to war with 
metal breastplates and horse hair 

2423
02:19:35,211 --> 02:19:40,211
helmets,
and you would have to be an expert to 

2424
02:19:40,211 --> 02:19:42,470
look at a picture of them in 1914 and a 
picture of Napoleon's cavalry in 18,

2425
02:19:42,471 --> 02:19:47,471
14 and find the differences.
The officers are going to go to war and 

2426
02:19:47,761 --> 02:19:50,070
white gloves.
They're gonna have swords,

2427
02:19:50,190 --> 02:19:55,190
they're gonna.
Stand up and troops are going to march 

2428
02:19:55,190 --> 02:19:58,011
into combat in like billiard ball 
formations or you know,

2429
02:19:58,380 --> 02:20:01,770
bowling pin formations,
drill formations from the battlefield.

2430
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:06,060
None of the people who consider this to 
be an integral part of military culture.

2431
02:20:06,061 --> 02:20:08,370
Want to learn that the rules have 
changed.

2432
02:20:08,850 --> 02:20:11,820
In 1905.
They got one lesson in 1914.

2433
02:20:11,821 --> 02:20:16,821
They were about to get another and the 
Germans get there is when they try to 

2434
02:20:16,821 --> 02:20:16,821
take these forts

2435
02:20:16,821 --> 02:20:17,110
on.
August fifth,

2436
02:20:17,111 --> 02:20:18,400
19,
14,

2437
02:20:19,090 --> 02:20:24,090
the Germans attack four of these Belgian
fourths now between the forts,

2438
02:20:26,070 --> 02:20:31,070
the Belgians and quickly put them 
infantry and there were a couple of 

2439
02:20:31,070 --> 02:20:31,070
machine guns around and whatnot and the 
Germans,

2440
02:20:31,070 --> 02:20:32,420
you know,
they're in a bit of a rush here.

2441
02:20:32,421 --> 02:20:34,310
They don't have time to sit there and 
starve things out.

2442
02:20:34,311 --> 02:20:39,311
This 30,000
man force with artillery has to go in 

2443
02:20:39,311 --> 02:20:40,570
there and power this through so that the
armies behind them can continue there.

2444
02:20:40,790 --> 02:20:45,320
If you just solve through Belgium,
France and they charge these,

2445
02:20:45,620 --> 02:20:49,180
you know,
entrenchments and the Belgian slaughter,

2446
02:20:49,181 --> 02:20:51,790
them,
slaughter them,

2447
02:20:54,070 --> 02:20:59,070
mounds of bodies,
and the Belgians can't figure out the 

2448
02:20:59,070 --> 02:21:03,391
best way to deal with it because the 
mounds of bodies become a problem 

2449
02:21:03,391 --> 02:21:06,250
because the mountains of bodies become 
places German troops can hide behind and

2450
02:21:06,251 --> 02:21:11,251
shoot from behind and launch attacks 
from behind and the Belgians are trying 

2451
02:21:11,251 --> 02:21:11,251
to figure out,
okay,

2452
02:21:11,251 --> 02:21:12,730
do we shoot through these bodies and 
create.

2453
02:21:12,731 --> 02:21:14,890
Can you create.
Can you create a whole through bodies if

2454
02:21:14,891 --> 02:21:16,450
you shoot through them with a machine 
gun long enough,

2455
02:21:16,600 --> 02:21:20,140
or do we send out people to risk their 
lives to create holes in the bodies that

2456
02:21:20,141 --> 02:21:25,141
we can shoot through?
Barbara Tuchman has a passage in her 

2457
02:21:25,141 --> 02:21:29,461
book where she quotes the commander of 
the Belgian forces that were resisting 

2458
02:21:29,461 --> 02:21:34,291
this German assault by Gen Vaughan,
emic and his Special Brigades Tuckman 

2459
02:21:34,291 --> 02:21:34,810
writes,
quote

2460
02:21:36,300 --> 02:21:41,100
on August Fifth Mx Brigades open to the 
attack on the four eastern most forcibly

2461
02:21:41,101 --> 02:21:43,770
edge with a cannonade by field 
artillery,

2462
02:21:43,950 --> 02:21:48,950
followed by an infantry assault.
The light shells made no impression on 

2463
02:21:48,950 --> 02:21:52,821
the fords,
and the Belgian guns poured a hail of 

2464
02:21:52,821 --> 02:21:53,880
fire on the German troops.
Slaughtering their front ranks.

2465
02:21:54,150 --> 02:21:57,900
Company after company came on making for
the spaces in between.

2466
02:21:57,901 --> 02:22:00,900
The forks were the Belgian entrenchments
had not been completed.

2467
02:22:01,290 --> 02:22:03,840
At some points where they broke through 
the German,

2468
02:22:03,841 --> 02:22:08,841
stormed up,
the slopes were the guns could not be 

2469
02:22:08,841 --> 02:22:10,170
depressed to reach them and were mowed 
down by machine guns.

2470
02:22:10,500 --> 02:22:14,370
The dead piled up enriches a yard high 
at fort boss,

2471
02:22:14,371 --> 02:22:19,371
shown Belgians,
seeing the German lines waiver charged 

2472
02:22:19,371 --> 02:22:21,180
with the bayonet.
And threw them back again and again.

2473
02:22:21,181 --> 02:22:25,470
The Germans returned to the assault 
spending lives like bullets in knowledge

2474
02:22:25,471 --> 02:22:27,810
of plentiful reserves to make up for the
losses.

2475
02:22:28,230 --> 02:22:31,680
She now quotes a Belgian officer who was
their quote.

2476
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:36,270
They made no attempt at deploying.
A Belgian officer described it later,

2477
02:22:36,660 --> 02:22:41,660
but came on line after line,
almost shoulder to shoulder until we 

2478
02:22:41,660 --> 02:22:45,351
shot them down.
The fallen were heaped on top of each 

2479
02:22:45,351 --> 02:22:48,180
other and unlawful barricade of dead and
wounded that threatened to mask our guns

2480
02:22:48,270 --> 02:22:53,270
and causes trouble so high to the 
barricade become the we didn't know 

2481
02:22:53,270 --> 02:22:56,160
whether to fire through it or to go out 
and clear openings with our hands,

2482
02:22:56,370 --> 02:23:01,370
but would you believe it?
This veritable wall of dead and dying 

2483
02:23:01,370 --> 02:23:04,821
enabled those wonderful Germans to creep
closer and actually charge up the 

2484
02:23:04,821 --> 02:23:09,591
embankment?
They got no farther than halfway though 

2485
02:23:09,591 --> 02:23:09,930
because our machine guns and rifles 
swept them back.

2486
02:23:10,230 --> 02:23:15,230
Of course we had our losses,
but they were slight compared to the 

2487
02:23:15,230 --> 02:23:16,740
current age we inflicted on our enemies.
And to quote,

2488
02:23:18,670 --> 02:23:23,670
it's interesting to note,
isn't it that Belgian officers respect 

2489
02:23:23,670 --> 02:23:24,850
for those wonderful Germans as he called
them,

2490
02:23:25,690 --> 02:23:30,690
exhibiting the military virtues of valor
that were so celebrated during this 

2491
02:23:31,121 --> 02:23:36,121
period where the romance of warfare,
which had always been strong in human 

2492
02:23:36,121 --> 02:23:37,330
culture,
was probably at its height,

2493
02:23:38,560 --> 02:23:42,460
the 19th century.
The romance was incredible.

2494
02:23:43,550 --> 02:23:48,550
This is the era where that romance runs 
into reality in a way that you just 

2495
02:23:48,550 --> 02:23:52,361
can't pretend.
I mean guys like you know William 

2496
02:23:52,361 --> 02:23:55,780
Tecumseh Sherman,
the civil war general for the US 

2497
02:23:55,780 --> 02:23:55,910
famously said that war is hell and it's 
glory is all Moonshine,

2498
02:23:56,330 --> 02:24:01,330
but that didn't really see into the mass
of the population is one historian had 

2499
02:24:01,330 --> 02:24:04,931
pointed out they weren't publishing a 
whole lot of combat photos and really 

2500
02:24:04,931 --> 02:24:09,161
nasty,
terrible stuff for the folks back home 

2501
02:24:09,161 --> 02:24:10,880
at any time during these periods.
So there wasn't a lot of stuff to really

2502
02:24:11,240 --> 02:24:16,240
counteract the romantic ideas of war.
This is the conflict where you can't 

2503
02:24:17,211 --> 02:24:22,211
hide it anymore.
And even though this Belgian officer 

2504
02:24:22,211 --> 02:24:23,320
looks at this German assault on his 
photos,

2505
02:24:23,350 --> 02:24:26,210
something akin to the charge of the 
light brigade,

2506
02:24:26,211 --> 02:24:31,130
the famous doomed charge of that British
cavalry during the Crimean war.

2507
02:24:31,640 --> 02:24:33,620
But here's the thing that this war is 
going to teach.

2508
02:24:33,890 --> 02:24:38,890
If you watch the charge of the light 
brigade and you think it's magnificent 

2509
02:24:38,890 --> 02:24:42,410
and brave,
a doomed sort of attack on the part of 

2510
02:24:42,410 --> 02:24:45,820
incredibly courageous men.
What happens if after the charge fails,

2511
02:24:46,490 --> 02:24:49,820
they send another one and the same 
results occur and then they send another

2512
02:24:49,821 --> 02:24:52,310
one in the same results occur and then 
they do it again.

2513
02:24:52,311 --> 02:24:54,920
And again.
At what point does this wonderful,

2514
02:24:55,160 --> 02:24:56,720
doomed,
romantic,

2515
02:24:56,930 --> 02:25:01,930
you know,
celebration of the courage of the 

2516
02:25:01,930 --> 02:25:02,360
military heart become something obscene.

2517
02:25:04,040 --> 02:25:09,040
This war is going to take us there and 
it's going to pound the point home until

2518
02:25:09,201 --> 02:25:10,130
you're sick of it.

2519
02:25:11,840 --> 02:25:14,720
After the failure of that German attack 
on the Belgian defenses,

2520
02:25:14,990 --> 02:25:17,930
the Germans regroup to attack again that
same night,

2521
02:25:17,960 --> 02:25:20,660
August fifth,
they're waiting for the sun to go down.

2522
02:25:21,290 --> 02:25:26,290
And witnesses who were with the troops 
described them as nervous and anxious 

2523
02:25:27,281 --> 02:25:31,240
and gloomy about the prospects of 
assaulting you know these defenses.

2524
02:25:31,241 --> 02:25:34,690
Again,
what's more doing it at night throughout

2525
02:25:34,691 --> 02:25:36,460
most of human history,
night assaults,

2526
02:25:36,670 --> 02:25:40,210
if you were lucky,
had torchlight illumination.

2527
02:25:40,211 --> 02:25:42,850
It was always a huge gamble,
very disorienting.

2528
02:25:42,851 --> 02:25:47,530
You couldn't see anything that was going
to change with this war and it was going

2529
02:25:47,531 --> 02:25:51,670
to be a facet of 20th century warfare 
that we may never see repeated again.

2530
02:25:51,671 --> 02:25:54,070
Now that night vision has become a 
battlefield staple.

2531
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:56,740
There is no reason to light up the 
battlefield.

2532
02:25:56,980 --> 02:26:01,980
In fact,
if one side has night vision and the 

2533
02:26:01,980 --> 02:26:01,980
other doesn't,
you don't want it lit up.

2534
02:26:01,980 --> 02:26:05,520
In this period,
these Germans were going to go into 

2535
02:26:05,520 --> 02:26:07,630
conflict where the nighttime darkness 
could be banished by technology.

2536
02:26:08,380 --> 02:26:13,380
You had search lights in these forts,
knew had search lights on the German 

2537
02:26:13,380 --> 02:26:16,411
side.
Sometimes you had shells that you could 

2538
02:26:16,411 --> 02:26:17,380
shoot up into the air that would 
illuminate the night sky and you have to

2539
02:26:17,381 --> 02:26:19,510
imagine bunches of those shells going 
off,

2540
02:26:19,770 --> 02:26:21,970
you know,
at separate intervals where they overlap

2541
02:26:21,971 --> 02:26:23,470
and so they're getting brighter and 
darker.

2542
02:26:23,471 --> 02:26:24,110
And it,
you know,

2543
02:26:24,120 --> 02:26:27,550
the look of it reminds you of like a 
flash bulb flash,

2544
02:26:27,551 --> 02:26:30,520
that sort of strobe light,
fluorescent lumination,

2545
02:26:30,940 --> 02:26:35,680
and it just casts a ghostly Paul over 
the whole battlefield so that every time

2546
02:26:35,681 --> 02:26:40,681
you get that burst of light,
you see thousands of people like ants 

2547
02:26:40,681 --> 02:26:42,070
moving along the battlefield and you 
have artillery going off.

2548
02:26:42,071 --> 02:26:47,071
And I mean,
just think about how weird and 

2549
02:26:47,071 --> 02:26:49,291
disorienting being in the middle of a 
modern battlefield would be in the 

2550
02:26:49,291 --> 02:26:49,291
daytime.

2551
02:26:49,291 --> 02:26:53,240
And now take away the light.
It's freaky and that's what these German

2552
02:26:53,290 --> 02:26:56,560
soldiers are about to face.
And they're understandably nervous.

2553
02:26:56,561 --> 02:26:59,410
They expected some sort of romantic kind
of war.

2554
02:26:59,411 --> 02:27:04,411
Even if it was dangerous,
you had a chance for heroism and a 

2555
02:27:04,411 --> 02:27:07,291
chance to die for your country.
I mean this is a generation that is 

2556
02:27:07,291 --> 02:27:10,890
absolutely infused with the ideas of 
nationalism and that dying for your 

2557
02:27:10,890 --> 02:27:14,911
country is a huge,
glorious thing that you should look 

2558
02:27:14,911 --> 02:27:14,911
forward to.
And now they're seeing,

2559
02:27:14,911 --> 02:27:19,561
wait a minute,
how glorious is it to be one of many 

2560
02:27:19,561 --> 02:27:20,050
people mowed down by machine guns,
you know,

2561
02:27:20,051 --> 02:27:25,051
just sort of randomly.
They don't want to go on the assault 

2562
02:27:25,051 --> 02:27:28,030
again and this attack starts to bog down
after it starts.

2563
02:27:29,110 --> 02:27:34,110
Now there's an officer who's roaming 
around the battlefield who normally is 

2564
02:27:34,421 --> 02:27:37,960
in Berlin with the high general staff of
the German military.

2565
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:43,320
The Germans encourage their staff 
members to get out in the field 

2566
02:27:43,320 --> 02:27:46,621
sometimes and see what's going on,
and this guy had a particular interest 

2567
02:27:46,621 --> 02:27:48,820
in this battle because he was one of the
people who planned it for years.

2568
02:27:48,821 --> 02:27:53,821
He'd been planning this battle.
He took his vacations from Germany to 

2569
02:27:53,821 --> 02:27:55,150
Belgium just to look around where the 
battle was going to be fought,

2570
02:27:55,480 --> 02:28:00,480
and now since he had a vested interest 
in hoping his plans were carried out 

2571
02:28:00,480 --> 02:28:04,351
correctly,
he's wandering around this battlefield 

2572
02:28:04,351 --> 02:28:06,721
at night looking for what the holdup is 
and finds out that the general 

2573
02:28:06,721 --> 02:28:08,680
commanding a certain part of the attack 
is dead killed by machine gun fire.

2574
02:28:08,830 --> 02:28:13,830
So this guy,
this staff officer who historians have 

2575
02:28:13,830 --> 02:28:17,881
described as absolutely devoid of fear,
big man,

2576
02:28:18,940 --> 02:28:22,520
grabs the unit of the dead,
five or 6,000

2577
02:28:22,521 --> 02:28:26,120
men in the dark and starts leading them 
toward the objective.

2578
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:31,040
Now you've got all these forts,
more than 400 guns from the fort,

2579
02:28:31,041 --> 02:28:36,041
so then the guns on the German site,
it's just got to be this unbelievable 

2580
02:28:36,041 --> 02:28:38,891
chaotic mess in the dark and this one 
general has grabbed this unit and is and

2581
02:28:38,961 --> 02:28:43,961
is heading toward the city of Leon,
which is protected by this circle 

2582
02:28:43,961 --> 02:28:45,830
affords right with men in between all 
the forts.

2583
02:28:46,250 --> 02:28:50,000
He finds a spot that's undefended leads 
this unit,

2584
02:28:50,001 --> 02:28:55,001
past the forts into the city on this 
gamble that maybe the city won't be 

2585
02:28:55,821 --> 02:28:58,040
defended or maybe if I walk in there 
with 6,000

2586
02:28:58,041 --> 02:28:59,690
guys,
they'll just lay down their weapons.

2587
02:29:00,990 --> 02:29:05,990
Now the Germans don't have a lot to 
celebrate in their military history and 

2588
02:29:05,990 --> 02:29:07,470
the Second World War because the cause 
was so nasty.

2589
02:29:07,620 --> 02:29:12,620
It doesn't matter.
You know how many good things their 

2590
02:29:12,620 --> 02:29:12,620
troops did in terms of military history,
in the military side of things.

2591
02:29:12,690 --> 02:29:15,030
The cause is so corrupted,
taints everything.

2592
02:29:15,270 --> 02:29:20,270
The Germans can take some justifiable 
pride in the adventure story of this guy

2593
02:29:20,401 --> 02:29:25,401
because first he walks in the city and 
everybody just sort of surrendered to 

2594
02:29:25,401 --> 02:29:27,060
him there and then he goes up to the 
citadel,

2595
02:29:27,061 --> 02:29:30,540
the main defense in the center of the 
city with his sword.

2596
02:29:30,541 --> 02:29:35,541
Hilt,
he pounds on the door demanding the 

2597
02:29:35,541 --> 02:29:38,271
surrender,
and they open up the door and they 

2598
02:29:38,271 --> 02:29:40,090
surrender.
Yikes.

2599
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:44,380
Talk about boldness,
talk about gambling.

2600
02:29:44,830 --> 02:29:48,850
This is a basically unknown German 
officer who,

2601
02:29:48,851 --> 02:29:53,851
because of the name he is making for 
himself will be in a position that some 

2602
02:29:53,851 --> 02:29:57,961
historians will call the military 
dictator of Germany within four years.

2603
02:29:59,170 --> 02:30:02,600
Name is Eric,
gluten Dorf Luton.

2604
02:30:02,620 --> 02:30:05,420
Doris actions that night remind us once 
again that even though,

2605
02:30:05,421 --> 02:30:07,910
as I've said several times,
the machines have kind of taken over the

2606
02:30:07,911 --> 02:30:10,070
dominant role in war,
fighting,

2607
02:30:10,370 --> 02:30:11,930
artillery,
guns,

2608
02:30:11,931 --> 02:30:15,740
all those things are machines.
You can't discount the human factor.

2609
02:30:15,890 --> 02:30:20,890
In fact,
the human factor is probably the 

2610
02:30:20,890 --> 02:30:23,051
dominant factor amongst adversaries that
are somewhat evenly matched.

2611
02:30:23,560 --> 02:30:25,580
I mean,
no amount of military genius is going to

2612
02:30:25,581 --> 02:30:29,930
save Belgium from Germany.
The differences between the potential of

2613
02:30:29,931 --> 02:30:34,931
the two sides is just too great,
but between relatively equal or only 

2614
02:30:34,931 --> 02:30:39,881
moderately unequal power is leadership,
could be the determining factor and the 

2615
02:30:39,881 --> 02:30:44,051
boldness shown by Ludendorff that night 
is a precursor to what we can expect 

2616
02:30:44,051 --> 02:30:46,610
from him later on and what the Russians 
can expect from him very,

2617
02:30:46,611 --> 02:30:48,950
very soon.
Now,

2618
02:30:48,951 --> 02:30:53,951
Ludin doors,
very audacious capture of the city of 

2619
02:30:53,951 --> 02:30:55,010
Leon doesn't solve the problem that the 
Germans have because all those forts are

2620
02:30:55,011 --> 02:30:56,990
still active.
He's taken the city,

2621
02:30:56,991 --> 02:31:01,991
he hasn't taken the forts and they're 
still there ready to shoot up German 

2622
02:31:01,991 --> 02:31:05,681
march columns if those,
if they're not taken before the big 

2623
02:31:05,681 --> 02:31:06,890
march starts,
so Ludin door calls for his,

2624
02:31:07,140 --> 02:31:08,240
you know,
ace in the hole.

2625
02:31:08,510 --> 02:31:13,510
As I said,
the Germans have been planning for this 

2626
02:31:13,510 --> 02:31:14,330
attack for a very long time.
They knew that the Belgians might resist

2627
02:31:14,450 --> 02:31:19,450
and they knew if they did,
they had to have a weapon that was 

2628
02:31:19,450 --> 02:31:20,250
greater than anything.
The people who built

2629
02:31:20,250 --> 02:31:24,300
these forts ever envisioned in the 18 
eighties,

2630
02:31:24,330 --> 02:31:27,450
although some of these forts dates of 
the 18 nineties in that era,

2631
02:31:27,870 --> 02:31:32,870
the forts were basically guaranteed to 
the Belgian government to be 

2632
02:31:32,870 --> 02:31:35,550
invulnerable to any cannon then known in
the world,

2633
02:31:36,150 --> 02:31:39,720
but the cannons that were then known in 
the world are no longer the maximum size

2634
02:31:39,721 --> 02:31:44,721
cannons available in the world.
Those belong to the Germans and no one 

2635
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:49,880
even knew it until they first showed up 
on the scene and they become an even 

2636
02:31:50,341 --> 02:31:53,210
better demonstration than the machine 
gunfire.

2637
02:31:53,310 --> 02:31:58,310
Mowing down those board Germans charging
the Belgian defenses that the weaponry 

2638
02:31:58,531 --> 02:32:03,531
was simply doomsday device like if you 
imagine it magnified thousands of times.

2639
02:32:07,320 --> 02:32:12,320
The weapons that are on the way from 
Germany to Belgium to reduce these forts

2640
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:18,620
are the best example I can think of to 
show how much has changed since the last

2641
02:32:18,901 --> 02:32:23,901
time.
The great powers fought each other in 

2642
02:32:23,901 --> 02:32:25,671
Europe 100 years before and nowhere is 
that more on display in evident than in 

2643
02:32:27,031 --> 02:32:32,031
artillery,
which a hundred years ago during 

2644
02:32:32,031 --> 02:32:32,820
Napoleon's time was already what 
Napoleon thought,

2645
02:32:32,821 --> 02:32:37,821
decided battles,
and he was a guy who made his bones in 

2646
02:32:37,821 --> 02:32:41,781
the artillery.
He rose through the ranks as an 

2647
02:32:41,781 --> 02:32:43,431
artillery officer.
He's known for it's used on the 

2648
02:32:43,431 --> 02:32:45,891
battlefield.
Here's a guy that that could shock 

2649
02:32:45,891 --> 02:32:48,801
people with the killing power of well 
used artillery and his big guns were 

2650
02:32:48,801 --> 02:32:53,541
firing 12 pound cannonballs,
12 pound cannonballs.

2651
02:32:57,080 --> 02:32:59,910
The gun itself weighed about 1200 
pounds.

2652
02:33:00,120 --> 02:33:05,120
It's the same gun essentially in in one 
case that both sides in the US civil war

2653
02:33:05,151 --> 02:33:07,520
used,
but a 1200 pound canon.

2654
02:33:08,540 --> 02:33:13,540
The gun that's on its way and the guns 
that are on the way from Berlin to 

2655
02:33:13,671 --> 02:33:17,630
Belgium way the largest ways,
almost 300,000

2656
02:33:17,750 --> 02:33:22,010
pounds,
1200 pounds to 300,000

2657
02:33:22,011 --> 02:33:27,011
pounds.
The shell that Napoleon's 12 pounders 

2658
02:33:27,620 --> 02:33:32,570
fired or between nine and 12 pounds.
The shell that this monster,

2659
02:33:32,900 --> 02:33:37,900
the 420 millimeter version of it that's 
on the way that Shell is 2000 pounds,

2660
02:33:39,980 --> 02:33:44,980
the Napoleonic era cannon,
that was so deadly at the time that it 

2661
02:33:44,980 --> 02:33:48,590
was shocking at a range of an effective 
range of about 2000 yards.

2662
02:33:49,250 --> 02:33:54,250
This weapon on the way to Belgium,
which isn't even designed for range at 

2663
02:33:54,250 --> 02:33:54,800
all.
It's a seed Canon,

2664
02:33:54,801 --> 02:33:56,540
so it doesn't even have to fire very 
far,

2665
02:33:56,960 --> 02:34:01,960
has seven times the range of that French
cannon that was designed to shoot far.

2666
02:34:04,050 --> 02:34:09,050
This is an entirely new kind of warfare 
and the people who actually see this gun

2667
02:34:10,621 --> 02:34:12,400
once it's assembled,
our slack,

2668
02:34:12,401 --> 02:34:17,401
jawed and assemble it must be because 
think about trying to transport

2669
02:34:18,520 --> 02:34:23,520
this thing.
Now we're talking about a gun that is 

2670
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:26,910
just over a 16 inch gun,
which is the largest naval gun with the 

2671
02:34:26,951 --> 02:34:31,951
exception of the Japanese Yamato Class.
Eighteen inch battleships ever put into 

2672
02:34:31,951 --> 02:34:36,601
the field that the great American 
battleships that Americans love to look 

2673
02:34:36,601 --> 02:34:37,180
at from the middle to the end of the 
Second World War.

2674
02:34:37,181 --> 02:34:42,181
Those are 16 inch guns.
These guns on the way to reduce these 

2675
02:34:42,181 --> 02:34:46,231
forts,
are those guns basically a tiny bit 

2676
02:34:46,231 --> 02:34:46,231
larger?
How would you transport them?

2677
02:34:46,231 --> 02:34:49,240
We get some giant tractor with 
caterpillar,

2678
02:34:49,241 --> 02:34:52,900
like wheels or something wouldn't.
You didn't have any of that.

2679
02:34:53,290 --> 02:34:57,310
They have horses,
so they disassemble this almost 300,000

2680
02:34:57,311 --> 02:35:02,311
pound piece of equipment and they and 
they transport it would like 35 horses 

2681
02:35:02,311 --> 02:35:03,430
taking each piece,
you know,

2682
02:35:03,431 --> 02:35:06,430
and anytime there's a dip in the road,
they've got to get people to prop things

2683
02:35:06,431 --> 02:35:11,431
up and help him.
It takes forever and then when they get 

2684
02:35:11,431 --> 02:35:11,470
to Belgium and the roads are all messed 
up and they have to take detours,

2685
02:35:11,471 --> 02:35:14,200
it takes forever to get these guns to 
where they need to be.

2686
02:35:14,200 --> 02:35:19,200
And then when they get there,
the crew and it's like a couple hundred 

2687
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:20,710
guys have to lay cement.
The cement has to dry,

2688
02:35:20,860 --> 02:35:22,810
the gun has to be assembled and put 
together,

2689
02:35:22,811 --> 02:35:25,180
and then when they want to fire this 
thing,

2690
02:35:25,181 --> 02:35:30,181
this gives you an idea of the monsters 
were talking about the gun crew had to 

2691
02:35:30,181 --> 02:35:34,831
go three football fields away,
300 yards away and fire the thing 

2692
02:35:35,081 --> 02:35:40,081
electronically and they were still so 
close that they had to put cotton 

2693
02:35:40,081 --> 02:35:42,820
wadding over their eyes,
their nose and their ears,

2694
02:35:43,270 --> 02:35:48,270
and they had to fire this thing while 
their mouth was open or they blow out 

2695
02:35:48,270 --> 02:35:49,720
their eardrums and potentially worse 
than that,

2696
02:35:52,260 --> 02:35:57,260
imagine what this weapon does.
The shell is fired in a 4,000

2697
02:35:58,160 --> 02:35:59,330
foot arch.

2698
02:36:00,350 --> 02:36:04,340
It takes a full minute to get from the 
gun to the target,

2699
02:36:04,341 --> 02:36:08,660
so you fire it and then there's the 62nd
wait until the explosion happens.

2700
02:36:09,140 --> 02:36:14,140
Unlike Napoleon's time,
we have cool shells that can be delayed 

2701
02:36:14,140 --> 02:36:18,470
action fused and armor piercing so that 
when you fire them at these forts,

2702
02:36:18,710 --> 02:36:21,140
they hit the top of the fourth.
That's the kind of arc they have.

2703
02:36:21,141 --> 02:36:26,141
They don't fire flat.
It's something they fire way up in the 

2704
02:36:26,141 --> 02:36:26,141
air and then it drops right on top of 
these forts,

2705
02:36:26,780 --> 02:36:31,780
a shell that pierces armor or concrete,
and then once it reaches its maximum 

2706
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:33,500
depth,
then it explodes.

2707
02:36:34,810 --> 02:36:39,810
The wonderful world of science and 
engineering is going to take over the 

2708
02:36:39,810 --> 02:36:43,721
battlefields of this upcoming conflict 
in a way that has never happened before 

2709
02:36:43,721 --> 02:36:46,700
and this weapon to me most symbolizes in
this early part of the war.

2710
02:36:47,210 --> 02:36:49,580
You know your example of here's your 
wakeup call.

2711
02:36:49,730 --> 02:36:54,730
Here's your darth vader.
Here's what 20th century warfare is 

2712
02:36:54,730 --> 02:36:58,481
going to mean.
The gun arrives along with some cousins 

2713
02:36:58,481 --> 02:37:02,100
were slightly smaller from the also 
great armaments workshop,

2714
02:37:02,120 --> 02:37:07,120
Skoda in Ostrow Hungarian territory then
and the weapons created by crop and 

2715
02:37:08,531 --> 02:37:13,531
Skoda start shelling these forts and 
they start going down and they start 

2716
02:37:13,531 --> 02:37:15,160
going down fast.
Now,

2717
02:37:15,320 --> 02:37:16,190
those of you who have listened

2718
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:16,970
to many of my shows,
no,

2719
02:37:16,971 --> 02:37:20,150
I'm not a huge John Keegan fan,
but as a historian,

2720
02:37:20,151 --> 02:37:25,010
I think he's best on his World War One 
and World War Two histories and he wrote

2721
02:37:25,011 --> 02:37:28,340
about this gun arrival outside.
The fordson said quote,

2722
02:37:30,720 --> 02:37:35,720
after it was placed,
the bombardment began the crew wearing 

2723
02:37:35,720 --> 02:37:40,431
head padding,
lay prone 300 yards away while the gun 

2724
02:37:40,431 --> 02:37:42,810
was fired electronically quoting 
somebody hit the scene.

2725
02:37:42,811 --> 02:37:46,350
Now quote,
60 seconds ticked by the time needed for

2726
02:37:46,351 --> 02:37:49,500
the shelter traverse it's 4,000
meter trajectory,

2727
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:54,680
and everyone listened in to the 
telephone report of our battery 

2728
02:37:54,680 --> 02:37:57,861
commander who had his observation post 
1500 meters from the bombardment Ford 

2729
02:37:57,870 --> 02:38:00,870
and could watch at close range the 
column of smoke,

2730
02:38:00,930 --> 02:38:03,750
Earth and fire that climbed into the 
heavens.

2731
02:38:04,200 --> 02:38:09,200
Keegan continues,
quote the first of the shells delay 

2732
02:38:09,200 --> 02:38:10,530
fused to explode only after penetration 
of the forge.

2733
02:38:10,531 --> 02:38:14,070
Protective skin fell short.
Six minutes later,

2734
02:38:14,280 --> 02:38:17,070
the next was fired.
Then five more.

2735
02:38:17,130 --> 02:38:19,680
Each of them walked up towards the 
target.

2736
02:38:19,830 --> 02:38:24,830
As the elevation was corrected,
the relentless approaching footfall of 

2737
02:38:24,830 --> 02:38:29,181
the detonations spoked to the paralyzed 
defenders of the devastation to come.

2738
02:38:29,940 --> 02:38:31,740
The eighth struck home.

2739
02:38:32,040 --> 02:38:37,040
Then the gun fell silent for the night,
but the next morning joined by the 

2740
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:40,971
other,
which had completed the journey from 

2741
02:38:40,971 --> 02:38:40,971
Essen.
The bombardment reopened,

2742
02:38:40,971 --> 02:38:45,440
the range had been found,
and soon the 2000 pounds shells were 

2743
02:38:45,440 --> 02:38:47,760
quote,
stripping away armor plate and blocks of

2744
02:38:47,761 --> 02:38:52,761
concrete cracking arches and poisoning 
the air with heavy brown fumes and quote

2745
02:38:54,750 --> 02:38:58,150
and Keegan then goes on to say,
no,

2746
02:38:58,160 --> 02:39:00,300
I'm not going to murder the poor French 
names of these forts,

2747
02:39:00,301 --> 02:39:03,060
but at 1230,
one fort is a wreck.

2748
02:39:03,061 --> 02:39:08,061
He says,
and this physically incapacitated and 

2749
02:39:08,061 --> 02:39:10,521
surrenders.
They then shift fire to another fort 

2750
02:39:10,521 --> 02:39:13,641
which surrenders five hours later.
A third explodes when it's magazine is 

2751
02:39:14,521 --> 02:39:19,521
hit by one of these shells completely 
destroying the whole thing that will 

2752
02:39:19,521 --> 02:39:20,250
happen to a couple of these forests by 
the way,

2753
02:39:20,460 --> 02:39:25,460
and when they find those,
the Germans who were first on the scene 

2754
02:39:25,460 --> 02:39:28,731
say that they look like quote,
a miniature Alpine landscape with debris

2755
02:39:29,491 --> 02:39:32,340
strewn about like pebbles in a mountain 
stream,

2756
02:39:32,670 --> 02:39:35,790
heavy artillery and ammunition had been 
thrown everywhere.

2757
02:39:36,030 --> 02:39:41,030
A cupela had been blown from its place 
and had fallen on its dome and it now 

2758
02:39:41,030 --> 02:39:43,470
looks like a monstrous tortoise lying on
its shell.

2759
02:39:44,940 --> 02:39:49,940
As these forts began to fall,
the artillery then closed in on the 

2760
02:39:49,940 --> 02:39:52,560
fourth that had the general commanding 
this whole affair,

2761
02:39:53,340 --> 02:39:58,340
and he himself wrote what it was like to
be under fire by weapons that no one had

2762
02:39:59,221 --> 02:40:01,960
ever seen the like of in human history,
quote,

2763
02:40:02,610 --> 02:40:06,510
a shell rec to the arcade under which 
the general staff were sheltering.

2764
02:40:06,810 --> 02:40:11,810
All light was extinguished by the force 
of the explosion and the officers ran 

2765
02:40:11,810 --> 02:40:14,010
the risk of asphyxiation by the horrible
emitted from

2766
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:16,170
the shell.
When the firing ceased,

2767
02:40:16,380 --> 02:40:19,950
I've ventured out on a tour of 
inspection on the external slopes,

2768
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:22,350
which I found had been reduced to a 
rubble heap.

2769
02:40:22,710 --> 02:40:24,330
A few minutes later,
he writes,

2770
02:40:24,630 --> 02:40:29,630
the bombardment was resumed.
It seemed as though all the German 

2771
02:40:29,630 --> 02:40:33,381
batteries were firing salvos.
Nobody will ever be able to form an 

2772
02:40:33,381 --> 02:40:34,770
adequate idea of what the reality was 
like.

2773
02:40:34,930 --> 02:40:39,930
I have only learned since that when the 
big siege mortars entered into the 

2774
02:40:39,930 --> 02:40:42,420
action,
they hurled against us shells weighing a

2775
02:40:42,420 --> 02:40:47,420
thousand kilos.
The explosive force of which surpassed 

2776
02:40:47,420 --> 02:40:49,521
anything known hitherto.
Their approach was to be heard in an 

2777
02:40:49,521 --> 02:40:51,330
acute buzzing,
and then they burst with thunderous.

2778
02:40:51,331 --> 02:40:54,540
Roar raising clouds of missiles,
stones and dust.

2779
02:40:54,900 --> 02:40:59,900
After some time passed and mid these 
horrors I wished to return to my 

2780
02:40:59,900 --> 02:41:03,921
observation tower,
but I'd hardly advanced a few feet into 

2781
02:41:03,921 --> 02:41:07,221
the gallery when a great blast passed by
and I was thrown violently to the 

2782
02:41:07,221 --> 02:41:07,221
ground.

2783
02:41:07,320 --> 02:41:12,320
I managed to get up and continued on my 
way only to be stopped by a choking 

2784
02:41:12,320 --> 02:41:16,761
clouds of poisonous gas.
It was a mixture of the gas from an 

2785
02:41:16,761 --> 02:41:17,280
explosion and the smoke of a fire and 
the troops.

2786
02:41:17,281 --> 02:41:19,080
Quarters,
we were driven back,

2787
02:41:19,260 --> 02:41:21,870
half suffocated,
looking out of a peephole.

2788
02:41:21,990 --> 02:41:26,610
I saw to my horror that the Ford had 
fallen slopes and counter slopes being a

2789
02:41:26,611 --> 02:41:31,611
chaos of rubbish while huge tongues 
aflame were shooting forth from the 

2790
02:41:31,611 --> 02:41:36,261
throat of the fortress.
My first and last thought he writes was 

2791
02:41:36,261 --> 02:41:39,921
to try to save.
The remnant of the garrison are rushed 

2792
02:41:39,921 --> 02:41:41,400
out to give orders and saw some soldiers
who I mistook for Belgians,

2793
02:41:41,401 --> 02:41:44,400
gendarmes.
I called them and then fell again.

2794
02:41:44,700 --> 02:41:47,390
Poisonous gases.
Seemed to grip my throat as an

2795
02:41:47,570 --> 02:41:48,890
face end quote.

2796
02:41:50,900 --> 02:41:54,380
He woke up to one of his aides and the 
German officer giving him water.

2797
02:41:55,130 --> 02:42:00,130
Those soldiers he thought were Belgian 
were German and they were the first to 

2798
02:42:00,130 --> 02:42:04,781
enter the fort after a shell detonated,
you know the magazine and the entire 

2799
02:42:04,781 --> 02:42:09,701
fort went up in a giant explosion.
These are enormous metal and steel and 

2800
02:42:12,411 --> 02:42:14,470
concrete,
you know,

2801
02:42:14,510 --> 02:42:19,510
forts.
These guns were pulverizing forts that 

2802
02:42:19,510 --> 02:42:23,771
were built to withstand the guns of just
a generation before and doing so with 

2803
02:42:24,080 --> 02:42:29,080
ease.
That's a demonstration of how much 

2804
02:42:29,080 --> 02:42:33,431
things had changed just since the 18 
eighties and think of how much things 

2805
02:42:33,431 --> 02:42:35,810
had changed from Napoleon's time to the 
18 eighties.

2806
02:42:36,320 --> 02:42:41,320
This was a 19th century world 
discovering the horrors of 20th century 

2807
02:42:41,841 --> 02:42:46,841
warfare and they were going to have to 
learn how to deal with this new reality.

2808
02:42:47,420 --> 02:42:52,420
One horrific bloody lesson at a time.
The lesson of leakage is at the era's of

2809
02:42:55,780 --> 02:43:00,780
basing your defenses on fortes is over.
This is a lesson that will not be 

2810
02:43:03,871 --> 02:43:08,871
learned and will be taught again in 
France in May 19,

2811
02:43:09,481 --> 02:43:10,050
40.

2812
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:16,240
It's also my opinion that the Germans 
are being taught a lesson.

2813
02:43:16,270 --> 02:43:19,810
Even as this story's going down and the 
guns are pulverizing,

2814
02:43:19,811 --> 02:43:23,560
the Fortune Belgium,
the Germans should be picking up on what

2815
02:43:24,280 --> 02:43:26,470
you know,
current events or trying to teach them.

2816
02:43:27,010 --> 02:43:32,010
They will never take that lesson to 
heart and they will repeat these 

2817
02:43:32,010 --> 02:43:33,340
mistakes that they're making in Belgium.
Again,

2818
02:43:33,820 --> 02:43:38,820
in the Second World War.
It's safe to say I think that the damage

2819
02:43:39,371 --> 02:43:44,371
done to the German reputation globally 
because of what's going on in Belgium 

2820
02:43:45,040 --> 02:43:50,040
won't go away until at least the 19 
fifties and I think you could make a 

2821
02:43:50,040 --> 02:43:54,061
very decent case.
I've never gone away and it involves 

2822
02:43:54,110 --> 02:43:59,110
German treatment of neutral countries 
and noncombatants wherever they find 

2823
02:43:59,781 --> 02:44:00,020
them.

2824
02:44:01,370 --> 02:44:03,920
And you know,
as you watch this story unfold,

2825
02:44:05,060 --> 02:44:10,060
it's clear that in some respects the 
Germans just don't get it when you would

2826
02:44:10,491 --> 02:44:12,420
think they would.
This is a country that in.

2827
02:44:12,430 --> 02:44:17,430
It's funny now they've lost this 
reputation due to two world wars and 

2828
02:44:17,430 --> 02:44:20,561
their involvement in both of them,
but they used to be considered an 

2829
02:44:20,561 --> 02:44:22,490
absolute hotbed of human culture.
You know,

2830
02:44:22,510 --> 02:44:27,510
the cutting edge of art and science and 
literature and thought and philosophy.

2831
02:44:29,061 --> 02:44:33,080
I mean all these things that the Germans
really prided themselves in music,

2832
02:44:33,110 --> 02:44:38,110
I mean an incredible people that guys 
like hg wells were intimidated by,

2833
02:44:38,760 --> 02:44:41,180
couldn't help admire them,
but was intimidated by how,

2834
02:44:41,630 --> 02:44:44,800
how ahead of things.
They seem to be at how advanced Asian to

2835
02:44:44,801 --> 02:44:49,801
be in all these areas.
How strangely ironic though that people 

2836
02:44:49,801 --> 02:44:54,281
that are so advanced in those areas 
could have so many blind spots in areas 

2837
02:44:54,281 --> 02:44:57,020
that one would think are related to the 
higher culture aspects.

2838
02:44:57,350 --> 02:45:01,160
Do the people who are producing such 
cutting edge higher culture,

2839
02:45:01,370 --> 02:45:06,370
how did they miss something that's 
likely to be as damaging to your 

2840
02:45:06,411 --> 02:45:11,411
international reputation as what history
now calls the rape of Belgium?

2841
02:45:13,370 --> 02:45:15,920
Now the rape of Belgium,
I should point out a little bit,

2842
02:45:16,460 --> 02:45:21,460
is a propagandists fantasy.
I mean they've made it into practically 

2843
02:45:21,460 --> 02:45:22,280
a movie.
The rape of Belgium.

2844
02:45:22,520 --> 02:45:27,520
Go see the rape of Dan King in your 
history books and then you will see 

2845
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:31,541
something that propagandists did not 
need to magnify it all to create a world

2846
02:45:32,510 --> 02:45:37,510
class historical atrocity killing field.
Belgium wasn't that,

2847
02:45:40,310 --> 02:45:45,310
but it was something and that something 
would come back to haunt the Germans in 

2848
02:45:45,310 --> 02:45:47,300
ways that they almost seem ignorant of 
again.

2849
02:45:47,540 --> 02:45:49,550
We quoted Hitler earlier about 
propaganda.

2850
02:45:49,850 --> 02:45:54,850
Hitler sees it after the war.
The Germans were just blindsided by 20th

2851
02:45:55,011 --> 02:46:00,011
century global communications and the 
ability to manipulate world opinion by 

2852
02:46:01,041 --> 02:46:06,041
taking things that were real facts and 
blowing them up to levels that just 

2853
02:46:06,620 --> 02:46:10,160
incensed whole societies,
including countries.

2854
02:46:11,150 --> 02:46:16,150
The Germans don't understand that the 
way they're conducting themselves in 

2855
02:46:16,150 --> 02:46:19,151
Belgium is affecting public opinion in 
places like the United States,

2856
02:46:19,820 --> 02:46:22,400
which have large German American 
populations by the way,

2857
02:46:22,401 --> 02:46:23,690
which are cheering,
you know,

2858
02:46:23,691 --> 02:46:28,691
the the feats of arms and how the German
military is showing themselves to be so 

2859
02:46:28,691 --> 02:46:28,691
dominant.

2860
02:46:28,691 --> 02:46:31,010
American papers are not 100 percent 
against the Germans at this point.

2861
02:46:31,130 --> 02:46:36,130
In some places.
American papers are in regions that are 

2862
02:46:36,130 --> 02:46:38,980
dominated by German Americans,
but they can't explain away what's 

2863
02:46:38,980 --> 02:46:42,290
happening in Belgium and what starts the
day.

2864
02:46:42,291 --> 02:46:47,291
The invasion of Belgium happens.
The Germans start killing Belgian 

2865
02:46:47,291 --> 02:46:51,971
citizens and they do so as part of what 
is now understood to be a policy of 

2866
02:46:56,141 --> 02:46:57,770
fruitfulness.
As it was called,

2867
02:46:57,771 --> 02:47:00,440
I'm not sure that's the perfect 
translation of the term,

2868
02:47:01,100 --> 02:47:03,460
but the Germans intended to,
you know,

2869
02:47:03,500 --> 02:47:08,500
set examples of people that did things 
that the Germans had said you shouldn't 

2870
02:47:08,500 --> 02:47:10,890
do.
They said you shouldn't blow up bridges.

2871
02:47:10,891 --> 02:47:14,460
If they find you blowing up bridges,
they are going to punish you and they do

2872
02:47:14,461 --> 02:47:18,170
not give probation.
They will hang you.

2873
02:47:18,171 --> 02:47:21,020
They will shoot you if they catch you 
trying to blow up a bridge.

2874
02:47:21,590 --> 02:47:24,050
The Germans take that even farther 
though.

2875
02:47:24,380 --> 02:47:26,630
If you're near a village,
we're a bridge,

2876
02:47:26,631 --> 02:47:29,330
gets blown up.
The village might pay the price.

2877
02:47:29,331 --> 02:47:31,580
The Germans believed in collective 
punishment.

2878
02:47:32,060 --> 02:47:37,060
They also believed in taking hostages 
for good behavior and when people did 

2879
02:47:37,060 --> 02:47:38,240
stuff anyway,
they killed the hostages.

2880
02:47:40,320 --> 02:47:44,280
This has been one of the most 
contentious parts of,

2881
02:47:44,730 --> 02:47:49,730
you know,
new scholarship all the time on the 

2882
02:47:49,730 --> 02:47:50,610
question of atrocities in Belgium 
because,

2883
02:47:50,770 --> 02:47:55,770
you know,
during the war it is this huge deal and 

2884
02:47:55,770 --> 02:47:55,770
those of you,
by the way,

2885
02:47:55,770 --> 02:47:59,691
who've lived long enough to have seen 
this same dynamic at work were real 

2886
02:47:59,691 --> 02:48:01,200
atrocities happened.
I remember in the first Gulf War,

2887
02:48:01,201 --> 02:48:02,460
the stories of,
you know,

2888
02:48:02,490 --> 02:48:07,490
Iraqi soldiers taking Kuwaiti babies out
of incubators and throwing them on the 

2889
02:48:07,490 --> 02:48:10,140
floor and then stealing the incubators 
and all these stories are normal because

2890
02:48:10,141 --> 02:48:15,141
real atrocities are going on,
but then they're magnified because the 

2891
02:48:15,141 --> 02:48:16,860
magnification works to the benefit of 
the enemies of the people.

2892
02:48:16,861 --> 02:48:21,861
The propaganda's working against the 
Germans went in and did a bunch of 

2893
02:48:21,861 --> 02:48:24,510
things in Belgium that make them look 
bad because they were bad,

2894
02:48:24,690 --> 02:48:27,900
and then the foreign media like the 
British were fantastic at this.

2895
02:48:27,901 --> 02:48:32,901
Get Ahold of those stories and turn them
into the worst things you can ever think

2896
02:48:33,001 --> 02:48:33,360
of.

2897
02:48:35,260 --> 02:48:38,680
The Germans only began to get this,
you know,

2898
02:48:38,681 --> 02:48:41,230
a few people at a time.
I mean later on,

2899
02:48:41,231 --> 02:48:46,231
much later on,
the Kaiser's Sonnet guy known as the 

2900
02:48:46,231 --> 02:48:49,171
crown prince would say that Belgium's 
when the Germans lost the first great 

2901
02:48:49,691 --> 02:48:54,691
battle of the war,
but they didn't lose it on the 

2902
02:48:54,691 --> 02:48:55,930
battlefield.
They crushed the Belgians.

2903
02:48:56,440 --> 02:49:01,440
They lost it in the realm of global 
public opinion because of their behavior

2904
02:49:01,870 --> 02:49:05,380
behavior that the Germans will use all 
throughout this war.

2905
02:49:05,381 --> 02:49:07,030
And again,
in the Second World War,

2906
02:49:07,560 --> 02:49:12,060
this tendency to ignore neutrality,
and as we said earlier,

2907
02:49:12,300 --> 02:49:14,100
the German diplomat,
you know,

2908
02:49:14,101 --> 02:49:19,101
told the British diplomat this,
you're going to go to war over a piece 

2909
02:49:19,101 --> 02:49:19,101
of paper.
It's just a piece of neutrality is often

2910
02:49:19,101 --> 02:49:21,840
violated in war.
That's kind of how they thought.

2911
02:49:23,220 --> 02:49:28,220
They also thought that you treat 
noncombatants harshly and you know,

2912
02:49:28,711 --> 02:49:31,320
to sort of soften that a little.

2913
02:49:31,320 --> 02:49:34,920
It's worth noting that the Germans treat
their own people this way.

2914
02:49:34,921 --> 02:49:39,921
They are a stern rather strict.
Some would say severe society 

2915
02:49:39,961 --> 02:49:41,090
especially,
you know,

2916
02:49:41,100 --> 02:49:43,760
the Prussian ised elements of it.
And they expect,

2917
02:49:43,820 --> 02:49:48,820
you know,
obedience and discipline and conformity 

2918
02:49:48,820 --> 02:49:48,820
to the rules and that's what they expect
of their own people.

2919
02:49:48,820 --> 02:49:51,120
And then they go into Belgium and when 
people violate the rules,

2920
02:49:51,480 --> 02:49:56,480
they get treated harshly.
Germans just failed to foresee maybe 

2921
02:49:56,480 --> 02:50:00,411
with cultural blinders that people that 
come from much less severe traditions 

2922
02:50:01,380 --> 02:50:06,380
would maybe play that quality up as 
something uniquely German and Nasty.

2923
02:50:09,030 --> 02:50:14,030
Not just that.
It should be pointed out that a lot of 

2924
02:50:14,030 --> 02:50:14,030
different people's,
you know,

2925
02:50:14,030 --> 02:50:18,100
in the world at this time,
we're having problems dealing with 

2926
02:50:18,100 --> 02:50:18,240
irregular fighting.
This was a big deal at the time.

2927
02:50:18,241 --> 02:50:19,920
Irregular fighting of course,
is when,

2928
02:50:20,310 --> 02:50:25,310
you know,
regular people take up arms and starts 

2929
02:50:25,310 --> 02:50:25,310
shooting at your soldiers like guerrilla
troops.

2930
02:50:25,310 --> 02:50:26,310
For example,
in Vietnam,

2931
02:50:26,490 --> 02:50:31,320
the US fought Viet Cong guerrillas,
very difficult to do causes all kinds of

2932
02:50:31,321 --> 02:50:33,030
problems.
Atrocities tend to happen.

2933
02:50:33,360 --> 02:50:35,190
Uh,
the British had just dealt with this,

2934
02:50:35,191 --> 02:50:39,900
not all together successfully in South 
Africa where atrocity issues happened.

2935
02:50:40,140 --> 02:50:42,810
The French were dealing with it in Asia 
and North Africa.

2936
02:50:43,020 --> 02:50:44,820
The Russians were dealing with it in 
central Asia.

2937
02:50:44,821 --> 02:50:47,040
The Japanese were dealing with it in 
China and Korea.

2938
02:50:47,700 --> 02:50:50,100
This is a problem a lot of countries 
were having.

2939
02:50:50,340 --> 02:50:54,300
The Germans were very worried about what
were called free shooters today we would

2940
02:50:54,301 --> 02:50:57,630
call them snipers because in the war of 
1870,

2941
02:50:57,631 --> 02:51:02,631
they had a lot of problems with snipers.
So they went into Belgium and if they 

2942
02:51:02,631 --> 02:51:04,800
thought snipers were there,
people paid the price left,

2943
02:51:04,801 --> 02:51:05,460
right.
And Center,

2944
02:51:05,780 --> 02:51:10,780
I mean,
whole towns would be executed if a 

2945
02:51:10,780 --> 02:51:10,890
sniper was loose.
And here's the worst part.

2946
02:51:11,610 --> 02:51:13,320
Snipers may not have even been loosed.

2947
02:51:13,320 --> 02:51:17,880
Some historians say these are a bunch of
gun shy soldiers who've never faced,

2948
02:51:18,300 --> 02:51:23,300
you know,
live fire where someone was shooting at 

2949
02:51:23,300 --> 02:51:25,791
them.
They may hear some German soldiers gun 

2950
02:51:25,791 --> 02:51:26,520
go off from the other side of town and 
start killing civilians.

2951
02:51:26,640 --> 02:51:31,640
It's a very controversial issue.
Some historians still foam at the mouth 

2952
02:51:32,281 --> 02:51:37,281
about A.
John Keegan strikes me as somebody 

2953
02:51:37,281 --> 02:51:39,111
who's,
who feels this absolute need to defend 

2954
02:51:39,111 --> 02:51:39,111
this idea of German,
you know,

2955
02:51:39,111 --> 02:51:39,111
uh,
uh,

2956
02:51:39,150 --> 02:51:44,150
devilishly this.
I have a couple of pieces I liked 

2957
02:51:44,161 --> 02:51:46,830
though.
Author Lynn Mcdonald wrote about this.

2958
02:51:46,831 --> 02:51:50,670
I thought she did a very balanced job.
And so did Neil Ferguson and Ferguson.

2959
02:51:50,940 --> 02:51:55,940
What I love about Ferguson says he goes 
and finds like the regional thing that 

2960
02:51:55,940 --> 02:51:57,160
happened and then how it got blown out 
of proportion.

2961
02:51:57,161 --> 02:51:58,380
And,
but nonetheless,

2962
02:51:58,620 --> 02:52:00,720
all these people emphasize the same 
thing.

2963
02:52:01,410 --> 02:52:03,430
These atrocities happen.
These people die.

2964
02:52:03,431 --> 02:52:05,790
The Germans practiced collective 
punishment,

2965
02:52:05,810 --> 02:52:07,630
all these awful things that most,
uh,

2966
02:52:07,960 --> 02:52:09,820
most of us reviled today.

2967
02:52:10,240 --> 02:52:15,240
And then they paid an extra price for it
by providing the basic seeds that would 

2968
02:52:15,240 --> 02:52:20,131
grow into enemy propaganda that would 
turn the Germans into Genghis Khan 

2969
02:52:20,131 --> 02:52:24,661
basically,
which is exactly what Lynn Mcdonald 

2970
02:52:24,661 --> 02:52:24,661
compares it to,
and she writes,

2971
02:52:24,661 --> 02:52:28,741
quote in the United Kingdom,
Germany's on had already been tried and 

2972
02:52:28,841 --> 02:52:31,570
found guilty.
Germany's name was mud,

2973
02:52:31,690 --> 02:52:34,360
and now that she had condemned herself 
out of her own mouth,

2974
02:52:34,510 --> 02:52:38,380
no rumor of Beast Gel outrage was two 
vial to be believed.

2975
02:52:38,650 --> 02:52:43,090
They emanated mainly from the refugees 
who had fled half terrified out of their

2976
02:52:43,091 --> 02:52:45,520
wits from the towns and villages of 
Belgium.

2977
02:52:45,790 --> 02:52:50,790
They were the firsthand accounts from 
people who had escaped from the flames 

2978
02:52:50,790 --> 02:52:54,271
of Van den,
where 200 hostages had been shot from 

2979
02:52:54,271 --> 02:52:55,090
two means.
We're 400 were gunned down and bayoneted

2980
02:52:55,270 --> 02:53:00,270
and from the inhabitants of not who 
would arouse the ire of the Germans by 

2981
02:53:00,270 --> 02:53:03,550
destroying the vital bridge,
the Germans revenge was to round up more

2982
02:53:03,550 --> 02:53:05,380
than 600 men,
women and children,

2983
02:53:05,560 --> 02:53:07,090
and shoot them in cold blood.

2984
02:53:07,390 --> 02:53:10,720
The youngest age,
three weeks died in his mother's arms.

2985
02:53:11,110 --> 02:53:14,740
These stories were true and the Germans 
made no attempt to keep them secret.

2986
02:53:14,830 --> 02:53:18,610
They were after all intended to warn.
Inevitably,

2987
02:53:18,611 --> 02:53:23,611
as they traveled,
they spawned fictions in their wake of 

2988
02:53:23,611 --> 02:53:23,860
rape,
of Macabre chillings,

2989
02:53:23,861 --> 02:53:26,530
of mutilation,
of breasts and hands,

2990
02:53:26,560 --> 02:53:31,560
sliced off by sabers of crucifixions,
of babies dipped into boiling water or 

2991
02:53:32,321 --> 02:53:37,321
swung for sport against brick walls.
There were even whispers of cannibalism.

2992
02:53:38,110 --> 02:53:42,670
Grains of truth swelled and grew into a 
crop of rumors of unspeakable.

2993
02:53:42,671 --> 02:53:47,671
Villainy is unsurpassed since the hordes
of Genghis Khan had rampaged and 

2994
02:53:47,671 --> 02:53:50,170
pillaged across Asia,
in France and in Britain.

2995
02:53:50,171 --> 02:53:53,410
The newspapers were full of them.
Public opinion hardened.

2996
02:53:53,620 --> 02:53:58,620
It was no longer merely adjust war.
It was positively righteous and people 

2997
02:53:58,841 --> 02:54:03,841
were out for blood and quote.
I don't think the Germans have recovered

2998
02:54:03,881 --> 02:54:05,650
from that image.
Even now,

2999
02:54:05,651 --> 02:54:06,190
have they?

3000
02:54:06,910 --> 02:54:11,910
You talk about a misstep.
What if the Germans had treated neutral 

3001
02:54:12,371 --> 02:54:15,760
countries and noncombatants with more 
respect?

3002
02:54:16,150 --> 02:54:18,430
How different might their reputation be 
today?

3003
02:54:18,580 --> 02:54:23,580
What if they'd learned from Belgium in 
1914 and reacted differently in 1939?

3004
02:54:25,900 --> 02:54:28,930
One thing's for sure,
this whole idea of rightfulness in order

3005
02:54:28,931 --> 02:54:30,280
to cow.
You know,

3006
02:54:30,310 --> 02:54:35,310
the people that you had just subjected 
to the boots of your soldiers that 

3007
02:54:35,310 --> 02:54:38,401
didn't work out bad policy foundations 
and the underpinnings of that idea.

3008
02:54:40,600 --> 02:54:42,790
It just didn't work.
And the people in charge of it were guys

3009
02:54:42,791 --> 02:54:46,720
like von Moltke who said know to his 
Austrian counterpart.

3010
02:54:46,930 --> 02:54:47,440
Yeah,
you know,

3011
02:54:47,441 --> 02:54:49,690
it's brutal.
Are advanced into Belgium is brutal,

3012
02:54:49,870 --> 02:54:50,920
but what are you going to do?
You know,

3013
02:54:50,921 --> 02:54:53,590
we're fighting to save our lives.
Basically,

3014
02:54:53,591 --> 02:54:58,591
this is life or death.
It's going to be a little brutal for 

3015
02:54:58,591 --> 02:54:58,591
awhile.
And guys like von Moltke,

3016
02:54:58,591 --> 02:54:59,950
he was one of these logical insanity 
guys.

3017
02:54:59,950 --> 02:55:01,970
Somebody asked him once,
um,

3018
02:55:02,080 --> 02:55:05,420
you know,
what the humane way to carry out war is?

3019
02:55:05,750 --> 02:55:08,330
And he famously said,
make it quick.

3020
02:55:08,630 --> 02:55:10,070
Brutal as you want.
Make it quick.

3021
02:55:10,071 --> 02:55:12,620
It's our old boxing analogy of on 
multiple was basically saying,

3022
02:55:12,621 --> 02:55:16,400
knock him out quick knockouts.
That's the nicest you can be,

3023
02:55:16,401 --> 02:55:19,700
even if it's horribly brutal to make the
knockout as quick as it is.

3024
02:55:19,850 --> 02:55:21,860
So von Moltke in this case is basically 
saying,

3025
02:55:21,861 --> 02:55:22,250
you know,
yeah,

3026
02:55:22,251 --> 02:55:23,870
it's a,
it's terrible.

3027
02:55:23,871 --> 02:55:24,470
But,
uh,

3028
02:55:24,640 --> 02:55:26,780
you know,
in the end this is going to save lives,

3029
02:55:27,710 --> 02:55:28,090
you know,
you,

3030
02:55:28,190 --> 02:55:30,400
you hang a few of these saboteurs,
uh,

3031
02:55:30,540 --> 02:55:35,540
you shoot a few of these people that 
snipe at your troops and then they 

3032
02:55:35,540 --> 02:55:35,600
stopped doing it and you don't have to 
burn whole villages down.

3033
02:55:35,601 --> 02:55:36,290
See how that works.

3034
02:55:38,300 --> 02:55:43,300
Neil Ferguson,
when he addresses this issue is 

3035
02:55:43,300 --> 02:55:46,151
basically sort of telling us to not be 
so naive and we've all lived through,

3036
02:55:46,700 --> 02:55:48,260
you know,
we're in the 21st century now.

3037
02:55:48,261 --> 02:55:52,820
We've had a long time to absorb the 
ideas of 20th century propaganda and how

3038
02:55:52,821 --> 02:55:57,821
it's a legitimate aspect of war.
And one of the things you do is perhaps 

3039
02:55:57,821 --> 02:55:59,180
paint your adversary in the worst 
possible light you can.

3040
02:55:59,181 --> 02:56:01,640
Again,
something that the Germans weren't quite

3041
02:56:01,700 --> 02:56:04,490
getting when the 20th century was brand 
new,

3042
02:56:04,760 --> 02:56:07,070
that they would get much better in the 
second world war.

3043
02:56:08,300 --> 02:56:11,660
Ferguson in his book,
tells a story where he talks about,

3044
02:56:11,910 --> 02:56:16,910
you know,
the ways in which this propaganda were 

3045
02:56:16,910 --> 02:56:19,121
used when he talks about how the British
newspapers would take photos sometimes 

3046
02:56:19,121 --> 02:56:21,090
from stories that had nothing to do with
this war.

3047
02:56:21,091 --> 02:56:26,091
And one case stories with that had 
photos from Russian pogroms against Jews

3048
02:56:26,450 --> 02:56:27,800
that happened before the war.

3049
02:56:27,980 --> 02:56:29,270
And then just,
you know,

3050
02:56:29,420 --> 02:56:33,140
captioning the photo with something that
says it's from this war.

3051
02:56:33,141 --> 02:56:36,320
I mean no one had any idea,
show a bunch of dead civilians and say,

3052
02:56:36,321 --> 02:56:39,530
this is what the Germans are doing.
Ferguson writes quote,

3053
02:56:39,980 --> 02:56:44,980
but prewar photographs of Russian 
pogroms genuinely were reprinted to,

3054
02:56:45,290 --> 02:56:48,950
in quotes,
illustrate stories of German behavior in

3055
02:56:48,951 --> 02:56:51,280
Belgium.
The Sunday chronicle he writes,

3056
02:56:51,300 --> 02:56:55,100
was one of many British papers which 
alleged that the Germans had cut off the

3057
02:56:55,101 --> 02:57:00,101
hands of Belgian children while the 
former scaremonger William luck who 

3058
02:57:00,101 --> 02:57:04,390
related with ill disguised relish the 
quote wild orgies of blood and 

3059
02:57:04,390 --> 02:57:08,570
debauchery and quote in which the 
Germans allegedly indulged,

3060
02:57:08,690 --> 02:57:13,690
including the quote,
ruthless violation and killing of 

3061
02:57:13,690 --> 02:57:16,991
defenseless women.
Girls and children of tender age and 

3062
02:57:16,991 --> 02:57:20,540
quote Ferguson continues quote other 
writers had great fun imagining.

3063
02:57:20,541 --> 02:57:25,541
Sixteen year old girls being quote,
forced to drink and quote unquote 

3064
02:57:25,541 --> 02:57:30,400
violated successively and quote on the 
lawn before having their breasts pierced

3065
02:57:30,831 --> 02:57:35,831
with bayonets.
And quote the bayoneted baby Ferguson 

3066
02:57:35,831 --> 02:57:39,551
says was another favorite image.
J H Morgan even threw in the charge of 

3067
02:57:39,620 --> 02:57:41,980
sodomy,
have little children and quote,

3068
02:57:42,440 --> 02:57:47,440
but even Ferguson is forced to deal with
the reality of the situation that this 

3069
02:57:47,440 --> 02:57:52,151
stuff wasn't manufactured out of whole 
cloth and that being a Belgium in the 

3070
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:58,000
line of German advance during this time 
period was a very dangerous position to 

3071
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:02,951
perhaps find yourself in and perhaps of 
no fault of your own Ferguson writes 

3072
02:58:02,951 --> 02:58:02,951
quote,

3073
02:58:04,450 --> 02:58:08,740
although the Entente press wildly 
exaggerated what went on in Belgium.

3074
02:58:08,890 --> 02:58:13,890
There is no question that the German 
army did commit atrocities there in 

3075
02:58:13,890 --> 02:58:17,851
1914.
According to evidence from the diaries 

3076
02:58:17,851 --> 02:58:18,130
of German soldiers and other reliable 
sources,

3077
02:58:18,370 --> 02:58:21,370
all the advancing German armies executed
civilians,

3078
02:58:21,520 --> 02:58:25,690
including women and priests altogether,
about 5,500

3079
02:58:25,730 --> 02:58:28,720
Belgian civilians were deliberately 
killed by the German army.

3080
02:58:28,930 --> 02:58:32,920
Most of them in the 11 day period from 
the 18th to the 28th of August,

3081
02:58:32,921 --> 02:58:37,921
1914 and at least another 500 in France.
The Germans also used civilians as human

3082
02:58:38,951 --> 02:58:42,040
shields and raised numerous villages to 
the ground.

3083
02:58:42,250 --> 02:58:47,250
In one case,
an 18 year old girl was bayoneted to 

3084
02:58:47,250 --> 02:58:49,651
death.
There were also numerous rapes in 

3085
02:58:49,651 --> 02:58:52,261
occupied France and quote John Keegan,
who obviously feels very strongly about 

3086
02:58:53,591 --> 02:58:54,250
this,
um,

3087
02:58:54,370 --> 02:58:57,370
goes out of his way to point out that 
these are not,

3088
02:58:58,040 --> 02:59:00,100
you know,
sort of ramshackle affairs,

3089
02:59:00,460 --> 02:59:05,460
that these involve lots of troops 
sometimes that these executions are not 

3090
02:59:05,460 --> 02:59:07,900
done by special execution squads is,
will be the case in the Second World War

3091
02:59:07,901 --> 02:59:12,901
sometimes,
but by regular units that the German 

3092
02:59:12,901 --> 02:59:12,901
army,
he writes,

3093
02:59:12,901 --> 02:59:16,171
quote,
the victims included children and women 

3094
02:59:16,171 --> 02:59:18,850
as well as men and the killings were 
systematic at 10 means the hostages were

3095
02:59:18,851 --> 02:59:23,851
masked in the square,
shot down by execution squads and 

3096
02:59:23,851 --> 02:59:23,851
survivors,
Bay and edit.

3097
02:59:23,860 --> 02:59:28,860
The execution.
Squads were not as where the action 

3098
02:59:28,860 --> 02:59:29,980
groups of Hitler's Holocaust,
especially recruited killers,

3099
02:59:30,130 --> 02:59:35,130
but ordinary German soldiers.
Indeed those who murdered at end den 

3100
02:59:35,130 --> 02:59:39,180
where the reservists of the most 
distinguished regimens of the Prussian 

3101
02:59:39,180 --> 02:59:39,280
army,
the guard regimen mentors,

3102
02:59:39,290 --> 02:59:44,290
will end quote and the Belgians would 
have every right.

3103
02:59:45,601 --> 02:59:49,170
You would think when you to wonder as 
they're living through this,

3104
02:59:49,620 --> 02:59:54,620
where their protectors are.
Now they signed these agreements that 

3105
02:59:54,620 --> 02:59:57,270
said that their independence was 
guaranteed by the greatest powers of the

3106
02:59:57,271 --> 02:59:58,860
age.
Where are those people right now?

3107
02:59:58,861 --> 03:00:03,861
When the Belgians need them?
All they see are the German army 

3108
03:00:03,861 --> 03:00:04,140
marching through and burning things and 
perhaps shooting people you know.

3109
03:00:06,000 --> 03:00:09,540
The answer is they're on the way.
The British are in the process,

3110
03:00:09,541 --> 03:00:14,541
right as we are in this story of landing
troops on the continent to aid the 

3111
03:00:14,541 --> 03:00:18,930
French who are finishing the last bits 
of the necessary ingredients so they can

3112
03:00:18,931 --> 03:00:23,931
launch an offensive.
The Russians are shocking everybody by 

3113
03:00:23,931 --> 03:00:27,621
putting together enough units to at 
least attack eastern Germany and remind 

3114
03:00:27,621 --> 03:00:30,540
the German that you can't just leave 
your eastern border undefended and throw

3115
03:00:30,541 --> 03:00:32,610
everything against France.
We're still here

3116
03:00:34,150 --> 03:00:39,150
and the ostrow Hungarians are about to 
find out exactly why the Serbs have such

3117
03:00:39,491 --> 03:00:44,491
a ferocious military reputation.
All this is going to happen pretty much 

3118
03:00:44,491 --> 03:00:49,321
simultaneously and it's going to be the 
first real consequential experiment to 

3119
03:00:51,221 --> 03:00:53,740
test a hypothesis,
a sort of celeste deal,

3120
03:00:53,741 --> 03:00:58,741
if you want,
or cosmic hypothesis concerning the 

3121
03:00:58,741 --> 03:01:00,280
question of whether or not know if you 
do it enough.

3122
03:01:00,820 --> 03:01:05,820
You can beat the violence out of a 
society or a culture or people or maybe 

3123
03:01:08,741 --> 03:01:13,741
given the globalization.
You know that this time period helps 

3124
03:01:13,741 --> 03:01:17,401
usher in maybe a world,
and the answer is that it depends on how

3125
03:01:18,591 --> 03:01:23,591
hard you beat them.
I guess no one's been beaten very hard 

3126
03:01:23,591 --> 03:01:25,370
yet in this story.
The Belgians are,

3127
03:01:25,490 --> 03:01:28,580
but an appetizer to what modern warfare 
is going to be like.

3128
03:01:29,090 --> 03:01:31,940
Modern warfare between the great powers 
on the planet.

3129
03:01:31,941 --> 03:01:36,590
The first experiment in this hypothesis 
of beating the violence out of societies

3130
03:01:37,340 --> 03:01:42,340
is on the way.
If there's an addiction to the human 

3131
03:01:42,340 --> 03:01:44,960
species,
what's about to happen is the first dose

3132
03:01:45,050 --> 03:01:48,130
of shock therapy to see if we can be 
curative.

3133
03:01:48,140 --> 03:01:48,350
It

3134
03:01:56,000 --> 03:02:00,020
be sure to follow us on twitter.
The address is at hardcore history.

3135
03:02:00,530 --> 03:02:02,910
Do you want to help the podcast?
We'd really appreciate it.

3136
03:02:02,911 --> 03:02:06,210
Here's how it works.
It's very simple just by your Amazon.com

3137
03:02:06,211 --> 03:02:10,830
products through the Amazon search 
window on Dan Carlin Dot com and Dan and

3138
03:02:10,831 --> 03:02:15,831
Ben will get a percentage of what you 
spend and it helps these guys out 

3139
03:02:15,831 --> 03:02:16,230
because they are nice young fellows.

3140
03:02:16,560 --> 03:02:18,780
If you think the show you just heard is 
worth a dollar,

3141
03:02:18,930 --> 03:02:21,810
Dan and Ben would love to have it.
A buck a show.

3142
03:02:21,870 --> 03:02:24,930
It's all we ask.
Go to Dan Carlin.com

3143
03:02:24,931 --> 03:02:27,450
for information on how to donate to the 
show.

3144
03:02:29,100 --> 03:02:34,100
Get their firstest with the most.
I think that's the phrase that made me 

3145
03:02:35,551 --> 03:02:40,551
cringe during the editing process.
Listening to the show you just heard 

3146
03:02:40,551 --> 03:02:42,750
because I could almost hear a five,
10,

3147
03:02:42,751 --> 03:02:47,751
15,000.
I don't know how many avid civil war 

3148
03:02:47,751 --> 03:02:47,751
buffs,
American civil war buffs.

3149
03:02:47,751 --> 03:02:48,420
We have listening,
but that's going to be a sore point with

3150
03:02:48,421 --> 03:02:50,520
them and I could tell when I listened to
it during editing,

3151
03:02:50,521 --> 03:02:51,270
I'm just going,
Ugh,

3152
03:02:51,330 --> 03:02:56,330
do I really want all those emails?
I didn't attribute that quote to anyone 

3153
03:02:56,330 --> 03:02:57,960
I just said a confederate cavalry 
commander,

3154
03:02:57,961 --> 03:03:02,961
but it was supposedly allegedly 
legendarily said by a guy named Nathan 

3155
03:03:02,961 --> 03:03:05,700
Bedford forrest.
A controversial figure even today,

3156
03:03:05,701 --> 03:03:10,701
but that's not unusual among confederate
generals and it's not even unheard of 

3157
03:03:10,701 --> 03:03:14,571
among union northern generals.
Forest is maybe in a class by himself,

3158
03:03:15,360 --> 03:03:19,980
but he's not controversial when it comes
to acknowledging his military genius.

3159
03:03:19,980 --> 03:03:24,980
He's one of the best American generals 
in this whole period in us history and 

3160
03:03:24,980 --> 03:03:29,271
he's an innovative cavalry commander.
He knows and has already absorbed the 

3161
03:03:29,271 --> 03:03:32,040
lesson that most European cavalry 
commanders,

3162
03:03:32,070 --> 03:03:37,070
even in the first world war when it 
breaks out that they haven't absorbed 

3163
03:03:37,070 --> 03:03:40,161
yet,
forest realizes that you can't use 

3164
03:03:40,161 --> 03:03:40,230
cavalry the way it's traditionally been 
used.

3165
03:03:40,400 --> 03:03:42,240
You know,
through its entire history.

3166
03:03:42,241 --> 03:03:44,280
Up until that point,
it's just too vulnerable.

3167
03:03:44,281 --> 03:03:49,281
Now.
The weapons had destroyed a lot of what 

3168
03:03:49,281 --> 03:03:51,711
cavalry could do,
so forest stripped down the job of 

3169
03:03:51,711 --> 03:03:55,851
cavalry to the bare minimum.
What does it do that nothing else can 

3170
03:03:55,851 --> 03:03:56,580
do,
and it moves people faster than anything

3171
03:03:56,581 --> 03:03:58,400
else can.
So we used it for that.

3172
03:03:59,110 --> 03:04:04,110
He essentially had an elite unit of 
mounted infantry and he would transport 

3173
03:04:04,131 --> 03:04:06,920
these people too vulnerable and 
important spots,

3174
03:04:07,130 --> 03:04:12,130
tactically important areas,
dismount them and use them as infantry 

3175
03:04:12,130 --> 03:04:15,491
and then use the horses to skedaddle out
of there before superior force could 

3176
03:04:15,491 --> 03:04:15,491
catch you.

3177
03:04:16,070 --> 03:04:21,070
It's a very modern way to use cavalry 
and really the only way that it could 

3178
03:04:21,070 --> 03:04:22,220
survive on a modern battlefield.
Of course,

3179
03:04:22,221 --> 03:04:27,221
the battlefield that Nathan Bedford 
forrest was trying to keep his cavalry 

3180
03:04:27,221 --> 03:04:28,580
live on nowhere near as deadly for 
anyone horses,

3181
03:04:28,581 --> 03:04:31,610
especially as the battlefields would be 
in 1914.

3182
03:04:31,880 --> 03:04:35,870
Those battlefields or on the way the 
appetizers over the main course is about

3183
03:04:35,871 --> 03:04:40,871
to begin this greatest army in the world
is about to run into what is probably 

3184
03:04:41,781 --> 03:04:46,781
the second greatest army in the world,
Francis and the probably in terms of 

3185
03:04:50,420 --> 03:04:54,500
bang for their buck.
Most elite military force,

3186
03:04:54,501 --> 03:04:56,720
most experienced military force in the 
world.

3187
03:04:56,960 --> 03:05:01,960
All these Germans marching on France,
great train troops who've never been in 

3188
03:05:01,960 --> 03:05:06,371
combat except against Belgians.
They're going to run into a British 

3189
03:05:06,371 --> 03:05:09,161
colonial force that's tiny,
but that has so much experience that 

3190
03:05:09,161 --> 03:05:13,391
there's almost no room for any more unit
owners for these units because they 

3191
03:05:14,301 --> 03:05:18,440
fought in so many parts of the world so 
long and so often they are not coming to

3192
03:05:18,441 --> 03:05:19,250
this war.

3193
03:05:19,610 --> 03:05:20,990
You know,
to learn on the job.

3194
03:05:21,230 --> 03:05:26,230
They've already done this job.
Many times they're going to be the only 

3195
03:05:26,230 --> 03:05:28,991
truly,
really experienced troops in this 

3196
03:05:28,991 --> 03:05:30,830
conflict which will make them to get 
back to our boxing metaphors.

3197
03:05:31,190 --> 03:05:36,190
Able to punch above their weight class,
they're going to give a lot better than 

3198
03:05:36,190 --> 03:05:40,631
their small numbers.
Probably indicate they would McCann 

3199
03:05:40,631 --> 03:05:41,120
anything stopped this German steam 
roller,

3200
03:05:42,380 --> 03:05:47,380
you know,
I've often been asked by people how 

3201
03:05:47,380 --> 03:05:49,931
large the army that defended imperial 
Rome was and at its height,

3202
03:05:53,330 --> 03:05:56,420
the high number,
you usually see a 750,000

3203
03:05:56,421 --> 03:05:58,820
men.
So the entire Roman empire,

3204
03:05:58,850 --> 03:06:03,850
that's not one arm you with the entire 
Roman empires know total number of 

3205
03:06:03,850 --> 03:06:04,530
soldiers throughout the entire,
you know,

3206
03:06:04,730 --> 03:06:08,540
borders and interior of the places.
Maybe 750,000

3207
03:06:08,541 --> 03:06:10,580
guys.
Seven hundred and 50,000

3208
03:06:10,581 --> 03:06:15,581
guys is also the upper limit number as 
we said in the show that Napoleon may 

3209
03:06:15,581 --> 03:06:18,470
have used in his famous and for Lauren 
invasion of Russia.

3210
03:06:19,070 --> 03:06:24,070
So that's a pretty big number just to 
understand what's bearing down on the 

3211
03:06:24,070 --> 03:06:28,471
small British force that's landed on the
continent and this French force who's 

3212
03:06:28,471 --> 03:06:29,780
waiting to find out what modern warfare 
is really like.

3213
03:06:30,800 --> 03:06:35,800
The low number is 750,000
Germans just simply marching through 

3214
03:06:36,741 --> 03:06:40,160
Belgium.
The high number is one point $5 million,

3215
03:06:40,400 --> 03:06:45,400
and that doesn't even count the troops 
facing the French along the traditional 

3216
03:06:45,400 --> 03:06:48,350
fortified hundred and 20 mile border.
That's normally the invasion route.

3217
03:06:49,010 --> 03:06:54,010
You have the equivalent of the entire 
armed power of the Roman Empire at its 

3218
03:06:56,011 --> 03:07:01,011
height using the Belgian road systems to
fall on northeastern France.

3219
03:07:02,160 --> 03:07:07,160
That's an amazing blow.
What happens when the irresistible force

3220
03:07:09,240 --> 03:07:11,910
in a runs into the immovable object?
Well,

3221
03:07:11,911 --> 03:07:16,911
we'll find out if either one of those 
titles turns out to be true in part to a

3222
03:07:18,361 --> 03:07:19,650
blueprint for Armageddon.
