To get started,

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,420
I've just heard the audio that you're 
about to hear and this is my own 

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,460
critique of the audio that you're about 
to hear and it's a little redundant only

6
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:30,461
because I actually started off the 
program with a little bit of that sort 

7
00:00:30,461 --> 00:00:31,400
of talk to.
So I apologize for the redundancy.

8
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:35,510
Um,
but I'm going to call this episode.

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,040
I'm going to throw a nightmare somehow 
because it sounds like a nightmare and I

10
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:43,130
don't just mean because of the material 
which is nightmarish.

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,310
Nothing new about that of course on what
we do,

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,420
but almost my recounting of it is like 
that.

13
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:54,520
Like you woke up in the middle of the 
night screaming and the next morning and

14
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:56,540
your spouse says to you,
what the heck was that all about?

15
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:01,541
And you try to recount what happened to 
you in your nightmare.

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,360
And it always sounds like a bunch of 
disjointed flashing images.

17
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:08,950
Um,
you know,

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,270
we always like to try to put a little 
artistic touch,

19
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,290
your little flare here or there with the
big hardcore history shows and I feel 

20
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:16,880
like that's what's missing in the audio 
that you're going to hear now.

21
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:21,881
It sounds like a nightmare.
It sounds like I'm just telling you the 

22
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:24,461
highlights or worst moments or the 
things that freaked me out the most or 

23
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:26,570
whatever is sticking in my memory after 
going back to sleep in the middle of the

24
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:29,330
night.
But for some of you especially,

25
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:34,331
I think you know,
those of you who already know some of 

26
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:36,131
this or all of this story,
it will remind you once again that you 

27
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:40,731
know,
if I'm recounting a nightmarish sort of 

28
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:44,261
story to you,
I mean think about how many people 

29
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:44,261
actually woke up in the night for many,
many,

30
00:01:44,261 --> 00:01:47,270
many decades after this event with this 
exact same nightmare.

31
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:52,271
And it's pretty safe to say that unlike 
me who wasn't there,

32
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,800
the people who were there would probably
be unable to tell anyone else who wasn't

33
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:59,150
there.
You know,

34
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:04,151
what they were seeing in their dreams.
So apologies for the lack of artistic 

35
00:02:04,151 --> 00:02:09,080
flair and what you're going to hear now,
but I'm in welcome to a nightmare of the

36
00:02:09,081 --> 00:02:09,980
Indianapolis.

37
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,310
It's hardcore history.

38
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,450
I've tried to think about what the 
difference between one of these hardcore

39
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:26,620
history addendums and one of the larger 
hardcore history shows is.

40
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:28,150
I mean,
what's the difference between the two of

41
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:31,330
them besides obviously that we're doing 
some interviews,

42
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,250
but I thought,
you know,

43
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:36,550
there's a whole bunch of great stories 
out there and I write them down.

44
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:41,551
You know,
whenever I think of when I put it in a 

45
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:41,551
book so that some day when I don't have 
enough ideas,

46
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:45,961
there's a bunch already down.
I know a lot of you do this too and a 

47
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:49,921
bunch of these ideas are not worth a 
whole history show or you can't do a 

48
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:50,590
whole history show.
I mean,

49
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:55,591
I'd love to do something and have wanted
to do something for a long time on the 

50
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:59,880
ancient Egyptian neighbor known as 
coolish cushite,

51
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,290
but there is no primary source material.

52
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,290
I mean,
it's one of those things where you just 

53
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:07,290
can't hang a whole show on what you have
to work with.

54
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,750
There's a lot of stories like that.
The one today is like that.

55
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,930
I mean there is actually enough material
to do a whole big four hour thing on 

56
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,270
this subject,
but it would get repetitive and it would

57
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:24,271
get repetitive in a way that makes the 
first world war program we did with 

58
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,300
risk.
Pretty repetitive in terms of,

59
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:26,770
you know,
ongoing horror.

60
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,910
It would make that seem a little tame 
because at a certain point in this story

61
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:35,911
there's nothing but that and it's 
psychological torture after a certain 

62
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:41,381
amount of time and so it's hard to not 
get gratuitous or it's hard to not just 

63
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:46,121
get redundant at a certain point.
You want to be able to say to the 

64
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:46,130
audience and there's just more of that 
and you know what that's like.

65
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,260
I thought about talking about this 
because I caught really the tail end the

66
00:03:53,811 --> 00:03:55,940
other night of a movie that's 
underrated.

67
00:03:55,941 --> 00:03:58,580
Although when I went online to do some 
more modern research on it,

68
00:03:58,581 --> 00:04:03,581
I was surprised to find that it is 
considered kind of an artistic classic 

69
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:07,691
now.
It's one of Steven Spielberg's really 

70
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:09,461
early movies.
It's jaws think it came out in 1975.

71
00:04:09,861 --> 00:04:14,861
I was 10 and I can tell you that it was 
a huge event and sort of an unexpected 

72
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:19,310
when there'd been a novel that had done 
pretty well,

73
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:24,490
but the novel was very different than 
the movie and the movie as all I think 

74
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,471
really great films do has a number of 
really fine actors in it and you give 

75
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:36,101
those people a of really fine script and
I guess there was a significant amount 

76
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:40,721
of improvisation from time to time that 
made it into the final version that the 

77
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:40,721
actors did.

78
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,760
But you remember who was in that 
immediate Roy Scheider who was great.

79
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,140
You had Richard Dreyfus who is still 
great and my God,

80
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:51,420
you had Robert Shaw who was unbelievable
in the.

81
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,840
In that role,
I mean among others,

82
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,240
and you get the three of them at certain
points in the story and they're just in 

83
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,240
the cabin.
I mean,

84
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,340
there's no scenery,
there's no movement,

85
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:06,341
really have the cameras.
It's just those three actors working to 

86
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:09,681
find script and at one point Robert Shaw
goes into a monologue and it's 

87
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:13,991
incredible from a,
from an appreciating the craft 

88
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:17,150
standpoint.
Those of you who remember though,

89
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,630
the monologue it has to do with the 
character that Robert Shaw,

90
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:27,320
his playing and his past.
He's playing sort of an old sea dog kind

91
00:05:27,321 --> 00:05:32,321
of fishermen who is going to catch this 
shark and he knows a lot about sharks 

92
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:35,450
and he goes into the background and it 
turns out he was on the USS Indianapolis

93
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,150
and those of you who know that story,
no,

94
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:39,860
how that's connected to sharks.

95
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,000
And so I'm watching this.
I'm the tail end.

96
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,620
Like I said,
Josie and the night I just thought,

97
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:49,340
you know,
the Indianapolis is an amazing story and

98
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:53,360
it typifies were sort of.
Some of my interests tend to lean,

99
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:58,361
as you all know.
I always like to say maybe it's a nice 

100
00:05:58,361 --> 00:05:59,270
way of saying that I'm into the extremes
of the human experience,

101
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:02,660
but some people think I'm just into war 
and violence and you know,

102
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:07,661
it's funny.
Sometimes I'll read accounts from like 

103
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:11,440
100 years ago.
There's a famous one from a German 

104
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,361
general named von Moltke where he talks 
about sort of the the reasons you 

105
00:06:13,361 --> 00:06:17,321
wouldn't want to go too long between 
wars because it brings out something in 

106
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:19,880
the human character and he's not talking
about the low level side.

107
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:20,190
You know,
the,

108
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,550
the killing of your fellow man and 
butchery.

109
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,790
He's talking about sort of the higher 
side of the human experience and it's 

110
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,940
weird to think about that.

111
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,140
See,
I don't agree with him about that.

112
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:38,141
I'm not going there,
but the story of the Indianapolis is a 

113
00:06:38,141 --> 00:06:40,730
perfect example of something where it 
only happens because of war,

114
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,630
but what happens after the sinking of 
the ship,

115
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:47,420
the famous sinking of the ship is one of
these tales were.

116
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:53,610
I mean you just.
It sends tears down your face and not 

117
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,780
just because of the human suffering,
but because of the human reaction to the

118
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,730
suffering,
right?

119
00:06:55,731 --> 00:07:00,731
That it was kind of those higher 
qualities that von Moltke was sort of 

120
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:04,331
referring to when you see people under 
amazing amounts of physical and 

121
00:07:04,331 --> 00:07:09,221
psychological pressure with fellow human
beings and how they act in situations 

122
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:14,501
that are far more stressful than what 
one could be expected to reasonably 

123
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:15,440
handle.

124
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:15,700
Yeah.

125
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,770
The Indianapolis combines a number of 
things which would make my top 10 list 

126
00:07:22,081 --> 00:07:27,081
of worst nightmares,
wrap them all into one wonderful 

127
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:27,081
package.

128
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,310
If you are a fan of disaster movies,
not to compare this to a disaster movie,

129
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:33,210
no offense,
um,

130
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,500
family members of Indianapolis 
survivors' or not survivors,

131
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,190
but I mean,
thank you.

132
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,550
My mom was in a movie once that was a 
knock,

133
00:07:41,551 --> 00:07:44,760
a knock off of the towering inferno.
So build a burning building.

134
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:49,761
That's a disaster movie.
You hang a whole movie on that and you 

135
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:49,761
have something like the Poseidon 
Adventure or titanic,

136
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,560
which is a disaster movie of a ship 
sinking at sea.

137
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,020
Hang a whole movie on that.
There are,

138
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:00,140
I mean each,
each segment and phase in the 

139
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,781
Indianapolis story is one of those 
disaster films and by the time the 

140
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:05,520
stories over and is the story ever 
really over,

141
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,140
um,
you know,

142
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:12,141
these people,
it's like these people went from the 

143
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:13,830
towering inferno,
hopped on board the titanic.

144
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:18,831
I mean it just one thing after another 
and I don't mean to make light of it 

145
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,311
because when you read the accounts of 
what these people went through and then 

146
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:27,171
you sort of magnify it because what they
went through is not that uncommon in 

147
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:30,180
human history that they're not like 
these real outliers.

148
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,040
It's uncommon for you and me to have 
gone through it.

149
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:37,041
But how many mariners over the waves 
over the era's have had their ship sink 

150
00:08:37,321 --> 00:08:38,760
and gone through the terrible things 
that,

151
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:43,761
that involves.
And then had to deal with some of the 

152
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:46,441
subsidiary things that all of the people
who went in the water with the 

153
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:48,090
Indianapolis had to deal with.
So in a funny way,

154
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,540
this is a kind of common,
uncommon human experience,

155
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:57,150
if you will.
All but the Indianapolis,

156
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:01,230
his story is they're just.
It's got its own twists.

157
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,360
In this case,
if you don't know it,

158
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:08,361
let me fill you in for a minute and I 
don't know how well this is going to 

159
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:09,150
work in short form because you know 
that's not my normal genre,

160
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,320
but the Indianapolis is famously known.
It's a USS Portland class cruiser.

161
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,390
Heavy cruiser.
Heavy cruisers generally mean,

162
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,020
you know,
bigger,

163
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:20,960
more armor,
a bigger gun.

164
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,010
So in the United States navy in the 
Second World War,

165
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:25,350
if it had six inch guns,
it was probably a light cruiser.

166
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:27,690
If it had eight inch guns,
it was probably a heavy cruiser,

167
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,430
about 10,000
tons,

168
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:33,240
big ship home between 600 and 700 feet 
long.

169
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,680
And in this case the Indianapolis is 
famous because it delivered some of the 

170
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,681
key components to an island in the 
Pacific that would be put together and 

171
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:46,821
made into the first atomic bomb.
But because of that it was a secret 

172
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:52,170
mission and people weren't really in the
know about the comings and the goings of

173
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:56,460
the Indianapolis perhaps as well as they
should have been aware of it.

174
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:02,390
And this kind of plays into the story in
a pretty big way because after 

175
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,830
delivering the components to the island 
of Tinian,

176
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,640
this Indianapolis Portland class heavy 
cruiser goes off on its merry way kind 

177
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:14,130
of towards the Philippines,
I think it was.

178
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,010
And in the night gets torpedoed by a 
Japanese submarine.

179
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:22,980
Now this is in 1945,
I think it's July.

180
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:24,180
So it's,
you know,

181
00:10:24,181 --> 00:10:26,640
we are not that far from the end of the 
war at all.

182
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:27,450
I mean,
as we said,

183
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:30,210
they're kind of putting the parts 
together for the Hiroshima bomb.

184
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,670
So not that far away from the end of the
war.

185
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:38,210
But now you get to the first level of 
this disaster that these Indianapolis 

186
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,991
folks have to deal with,
imagined being asleep in your bunk at 

187
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:45,480
night on a ship and to torpedo,
slam into it.

188
00:10:45,481 --> 00:10:47,400
One slammed into the bow at the front of
the ship,

189
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:48,840
one slam,
sort of mid ships,

190
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:50,970
but a little forward,
um,

191
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,250
survivors' accounts.
And by the way,

192
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:58,251
you want to read a good book on this.
Let me just break into this for a 

193
00:10:58,251 --> 00:11:00,980
minute.
I really loved in harm's way by Doug 

194
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,450
Stanton,
although there are several books on the 

195
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:05,450
Indianapolis.

196
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:05,580
I'm going to quote a couple of pieces 
from Stanton's book,

197
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,130
but if you think the story is 
interesting and you want to get the real

198
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:09,390
feel for it,
he does a great job,

199
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:12,060
I think.
But Stanton talks about,

200
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,650
you know,
when the two torpedoes hit,

201
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:18,651
he,
he's talking to a survivor that was 

202
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:18,770
loaded than the front of the ship and he
was asleep in his bunk.

203
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:19,470
And one of these,
uh,

204
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,480
you know,
sort of ship rooms that they have that 

205
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:24,480
you probably have six,
eight,

206
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,070
10 guys in the bunks are stacked against
the wall.

207
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,250
And when the torpedoes hit,
the survivor says the lights go out and 

208
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,210
all the bunks fall and everybody's in a 
pile of people and some have broken arms

209
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:38,211
and ribs.
And everybody of course woken up from a 

210
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:38,211
deep sleep.
You're totally confused.

211
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:38,940
And with the lights out,
it's extra bad.

212
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:44,510
So immediately this ship starts having 
problems and so the crew starts doing 

213
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:49,110
the typical things you do to try to 
prevent the ship from sinking.

214
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:54,111
And one of the things you do is you 
start walling off the compartments that 

215
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:54,111
are damaged and flooding

216
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,580
dogging things down is the way a stanton
has the navy guys describing it in the 

217
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,841
book.
But the problem with that is if you're 

218
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:03,841
cutting off compartments that are 
flooding,

219
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:06,010
what do you do with the people that are 
still in the flooding compartments?

220
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:11,011
Right?
So the first thing that just horrifies 

221
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:13,321
you in this story of the Indianapolis 
going down at night in the tropical 

222
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:15,130
waters,
sort of east of the Philippines,

223
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,490
is that you have these sailors who have 
to cut their own ship mates off in 

224
00:12:22,961 --> 00:12:24,880
flooding compartments.
And Stan says,

225
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:26,320
you can hear him scream,
you know,

226
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:27,610
don't,
don't leave us here.

227
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:28,000
I mean,
what do you.

228
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,160
But what are you supposed to do?
So right there you get in what to talk 

229
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,941
human experiences that are extreme and 
that are already larger than most of us 

230
00:12:35,941 --> 00:12:37,900
will ever face in the first five minutes
of this disaster.

231
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,900
There are guys dealing with things that 
are going to haunt their memories the 

232
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,270
rest of their lives.
And the end,

233
00:12:43,271 --> 00:12:46,480
the affair is hardly started.
You know,

234
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:51,481
when you talk about the human capacity 
for endurance survival and not just 

235
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:55,120
survival through the event,
but then to be able to live with it,

236
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,680
you know,
afterwards,

237
00:12:56,681 --> 00:13:01,681
and by the way,
the guy who was the captain of the 

238
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:04,700
Indianapolis made it about 20 years,
um,

239
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,820
afterwards he'll survive the whole 
thing,

240
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:11,821
but he'll kill himself.
Still Getting Christmas cards from 

241
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:14,770
people who say,
and I'm quoting one here,

242
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,820
merry Christmas.
Our family's holiday would be a lot 

243
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,860
merrier if you hadn't killed my son,
stent.

244
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,440
And says that the captain,
a guy named mcvay would keep all of 

245
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,290
these letters and put them,
you know,

246
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,630
with a ribbon around them and keep them 
in his desk,

247
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,910
blaming himself always for what happened
on that dark night.

248
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:41,910
But on this ship,
these people that survive will talk 

249
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:42,970
about seeing him,
you know,

250
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:46,450
running around this sinking ship as it 
starts to take on water.

251
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:51,451
And by the way,
they have 12 minutes between the time 

252
00:13:51,451 --> 00:13:52,330
the torpedo strike until the time it 
goes down.

253
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:58,630
And once again,
the idea of having a between 600 and 700

254
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:00,310
foot long,
10,000

255
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:05,311
ton ship begin to disintegrate out from 
under you and go under water as the 

256
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,970
waves begin rolling people off the deck 
is crazy also.

257
00:14:09,971 --> 00:14:13,810
So now right away we're like the second 
stage.

258
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:18,811
So you had to cut your semen off and dog
down into compartments and consign them 

259
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,490
to certain depths of the rest of the 
ship might survive.

260
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,850
Now you're dealing with the mental image
of this ship starting to go down by the 

261
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:31,540
bow that's in the front and the stern 
starts to slowly rise out of the.

262
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,570
I mean the ship is going perpendicular 
and people are dropping off and stanton 

263
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,860
describe survivors saying people will 
jump off and hit the rudders.

264
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:43,861
People will jump off and hit the 
propellors that are still spinning and 

265
00:14:43,861 --> 00:14:46,420
be launched off into space.
Once again,

266
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:51,421
how do you even in 12 minutes or less 
really pro process all this and it's 

267
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:57,191
dark and people are freaking out.
I mean this is like a giant accident 

268
00:14:57,191 --> 00:15:00,770
scene right away.
There's like between 11 and 1200 guys on

269
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:05,771
the ship and more than 300 are going to 
die in the first 12 minutes,

270
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:11,760
and so you're watching all this 
happening and many of these people now 

271
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:11,760
are grievously wounded.

272
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:18,190
Stanton,
I'm one of the main survivors he talks 

273
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,711
about in this thing.
I mean the first thing he hears when he 

274
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,460
recovers from hearing the torpedo hits 
is somebody screaming in the compartment

275
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:25,190
next door and he runs over there,
realizes it's his friend,

276
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:30,191
the dentist,
but he can't open the door because the 

277
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:32,201
whole thing's on fire and he just has to
let him burn to death in the first two 

278
00:15:32,201 --> 00:15:35,441
minutes and then he burns his hand 
because the ship itself is turning red 

279
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:39,911
hot.
He puts his hands on the deck or on a 

280
00:15:39,911 --> 00:15:39,911
rail boom and he's got burned hands

281
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,760
and then there's the ship starts to go 
kind of perpendicular.

282
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,020
He tells the story about they have a 
bunch of wounded people,

283
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:53,021
I guess in the Sick Bay,
but they're on cots and they're tied to 

284
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:56,381
their beds and whatnot and he says they 
just all slide right into the sea and 

285
00:15:56,381 --> 00:15:58,700
he's sitting there watching this happen.
Slack,

286
00:15:58,701 --> 00:16:03,701
jawed.
I read a book a while back and it's 

287
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:08,561
about how people react in disasters,
trying to remember what it was like if 

288
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:10,760
the worst should occur or something like
that.

289
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,690
I think we talked about at once.
Um,

290
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:18,070
but,
but it's by one of these experts who 

291
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,811
studies these things and one of the 
things that they said is in situations 

292
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:19,811
like this,
right?

293
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:21,260
Plane crashes,
shipwrecks or whatnot.

294
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,370
Most people are like stunned into 
numbness.

295
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:29,690
They don't do anything right.
In some of these bad plane crashes,

296
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,020
everybody could have gotten out,
but they sat there and burned to death,

297
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,610
you know,
on the tarmac.

298
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,910
That's shocking.
But that's what you would expect to 

299
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,271
happen on a ship like this.
And yet maybe it's the military 

300
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:43,271
training.
Who knows?

301
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:45,500
Maybe it's the thank.
You have officers barking out orders,

302
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:50,740
but you're not seeing a ton of that.
You are seeing people jumping in the 

303
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,830
water as fast as they can go because 
they're all afraid of the same thing.

304
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,100
When a big ship goes down,
it sucks stuffed down with it.

305
00:16:55,101 --> 00:17:00,101
A lot of the time it creates a vacuum 
that that can drowned swimmers who are 

306
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:02,330
anywhere nearby so everyone knows that 
the ship's going down.

307
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,980
You've got to get as far away from it as
possible.

308
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:08,981
It's like you know when you get into an 
auto wreck and you're worried that the 

309
00:17:08,981 --> 00:17:09,140
gasoline is leaking in,
the car is going to catch on fire.

310
00:17:09,141 --> 00:17:10,520
You want to get far away from it.
Well,

311
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:15,521
when the ship goes down,
it's going to suck everything down with 

312
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:15,521
it.

313
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:15,521
In several of the survivors,
once again,

314
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:20,111
imagine this,
one of them talks about having it feel 

315
00:17:20,111 --> 00:17:23,480
as though somebody was yanking his foot 
in his shoe came off and all of a sudden

316
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:28,481
with a life vest,
he went way under water to where his 

317
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:32,171
ears are popping in.
His eyes feel like they're going to pop 

318
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:35,321
out of his head,
and then he said he got caught in a 

319
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,980
giant air bubble that escaped from the 
sinking ship and it goes,

320
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,160
pops up and shoots him up.
He said three feet into the air before 

321
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,901
we came down again in an absolutely 
pitch black ocean covered as far as the 

322
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:52,680
eye could see.
It could see in the dark with a two inch

323
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,370
thick molasses like consistency,
oil spill from the ship that is burning 

324
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:05,331
the eyes and coding all of these men.
And if you ever look at photographs of 

325
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:10,610
people being rescued from like their 
shipping torpedoed when maybe they were 

326
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,090
in the merchant marine,
maybe they were on a destroyer,

327
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,240
but you can kind of see there's some 
great a life magazine ones I recall.

328
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:20,390
And when they come on board,
they're covered in oil and that's what 

329
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,001
these people are instantly covered in.
And what's worse is that oil can catch 

330
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,200
on fire and the surface of the ocean can
burn.

331
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,820
That happened.
If you look at,

332
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,140
um,
movie footage,

333
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:33,141
you can see that happen to Pearl Harbor.
You know the ocean caught on fire in 

334
00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:36,441
places,
so at this point what you have is the 

335
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:40,911
equivalent of like the titanic sinking 
where the Lusitania is torpedoing big 

336
00:18:42,781 --> 00:18:45,720
ship going down in the middle of the 
ocean.

337
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:51,050
Now,
difference between both the titanic and 

338
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:51,050
the Lusitania,
though,

339
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:55,220
if I can boil it down to one thing is 
the temperature.

340
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,980
When the titanic sank,
you had an iceberg,

341
00:18:58,981 --> 00:19:03,981
so it's cold.
The Lusitania went down sort of over by 

342
00:19:03,981 --> 00:19:06,720
Ireland.
I believe I'm cold water.

343
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,530
You're not going to have people 
surviving a long time in the water.

344
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:16,250
Now,
if you're trying to rescue them 

345
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:16,950
actively,
this is a nightmarish situation,

346
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:17,220
right?

347
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,850
You've got to get to the people before 
they get hypothermia and they die in the

348
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:23,280
water.
On the other hand,

349
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,510
if you're going to die anyway in the 
water,

350
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:30,720
in the Pacific,
in the very tropical warm regions,

351
00:19:30,721 --> 00:19:35,721
you might wish it had come as quickly as
cold water because when the water is 

352
00:19:35,721 --> 00:19:39,000
warm as it is,
sometimes slightly over 80 degrees,

353
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:44,390
you can stay on the water a long time.
Good thing if you're trying to be 

354
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,480
rescued,
bad things.

355
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:50,481
If there's other things in the water you
know besides you that you need to worry 

356
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:55,521
about,
also bad if you don't have any fresh 

357
00:19:55,521 --> 00:19:55,521
water,
which they don't,

358
00:19:55,521 --> 00:20:00,350
and all of a sudden,
I think 300 or so men perished right 

359
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,881
away.
Nine hundred or so men are in the water 

360
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:04,920
and you begin.
Now,

361
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:07,470
the other part of the nightmarish thing,
um,

362
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,030
I don't know how many of you have been 
in the ocean at night in the water,

363
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:13,140
in the ocean at night.

364
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,020
There's something calm and beautiful 
about it.

365
00:20:16,021 --> 00:20:18,060
Isn't there?
But there's something,

366
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:19,890
a little freaky about it too.
First of all,

367
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:24,891
you have no idea what's going on 
underneath you if you're in the deep 

368
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:25,080
areas,
right?

369
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:27,690
I mean there's a whole world of ocean 
underneath you.

370
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:34,010
What's more is if there is no moon out,
it can get pitch black and you can't see

371
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,160
anything.
So now when we talk about personal 

372
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,421
things that would bother us.
We're getting into my own personal 

373
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:47,211
nightmares a little bit here because you
throw me out in the middle of the ocean 

374
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,140
in pitch black darkness.
That is.

375
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:53,840
So I'm already going to have some 
psychological problems,

376
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:58,841
I think,
and I do think that this is why these 

377
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,991
stories fascinate me because these 
figures in the story because of things 

378
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:06,320
like war are cast into situations that 
are well unimaginable.

379
00:21:06,321 --> 00:21:11,321
And if they just gave up,
we would totally understand the fact 

380
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:11,640
that they don't is,
you know,

381
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,830
the old,
it's a cliche,

382
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,450
but it's the triumph of the human 
species.

383
00:21:14,451 --> 00:21:14,810
Right?

384
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:22,100
And let's be honest,
a bunch of people do give up in this 

385
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:22,100
story and you can totally sympathize 
with them too,

386
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:27,050
when you hear what they've gone through.
So the story continues and you begin to 

387
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:27,050
find,
you know,

388
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:27,860
the men,
you know,

389
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,260
as the light of day breaks out in 
groups,

390
00:21:31,261 --> 00:21:34,080
they're all in clusters spread out over 
a great distance,

391
00:21:34,081 --> 00:21:35,100
you know,
calling to each other,

392
00:21:35,101 --> 00:21:40,101
trying to find each other,
trying to sort of swim to each other as 

393
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:40,170
best they can.
The horrible part of the story now,

394
00:21:40,171 --> 00:21:45,171
when they're in the water though,
is a lot of people have horrible 

395
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:45,180
injuries.
You didn't have a bunch of healthy,

396
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,440
you know,
ready to go.

397
00:21:46,441 --> 00:21:48,300
Lifeguard type people,
jump in the water,

398
00:21:48,301 --> 00:21:50,850
you had a bunch of shipwreck survivors,
people,

399
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,620
you know,
one guy in the story,

400
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,180
um,
and once again,

401
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:59,181
I always try to remember that the people
who were with these people who survived 

402
00:21:59,181 --> 00:22:00,180
carried these memories with them 
forever.

403
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,360
But one guy in this story,
I'm a friend of one of the people he 

404
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,171
keeps quoting in the book,
Stanton has his eyes completely burned 

405
00:22:09,171 --> 00:22:11,100
out and he's going to die,
but it's going to take him time,

406
00:22:11,101 --> 00:22:16,101
but nobody wants to leave him again.
You see these higher qualities come to 

407
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:16,101
the fore where,
I mean,

408
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:20,751
nobody might survive this,
but we're going to take a guy who's 

409
00:22:20,751 --> 00:22:20,751
certainly not going to survive it and 
expand,

410
00:22:20,751 --> 00:22:25,720
you know,
important energy that could be spent on 

411
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:25,720
living people that are,
you know,

412
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:25,720
could go either way.
But that's,

413
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,810
that's the higher human qualities,
right?

414
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,180
And so he talks about this guy 
eventually saying,

415
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:32,060
I'm not going to make it.
I want,

416
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:33,690
here's what I want you to tell my wife,
you know,

417
00:22:33,691 --> 00:22:35,640
and all these kinds of things.
And it's wrenching.

418
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,740
Once again,
I can't help but think that if the 

419
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,590
person,
I think he's a doctor who's hearing this

420
00:22:43,591 --> 00:22:45,120
man with the burnout,
I'll tell him,

421
00:22:45,121 --> 00:22:46,470
you know,
here's what I want you to tell my wife.

422
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,500
If he's in no danger at all,
he's going to take that memory to the 

423
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,050
grave with him,
right?

424
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:57,051
Probably going to drink a lot more 
whiskey than he otherwise would have 

425
00:22:57,051 --> 00:22:59,160
drank in his life because that is such a
emotionally impacting moment,

426
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,520
but he himself is about to go through 
this harrowing experience and it's going

427
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:07,650
to be one hammer blow to the psyche of 
these people after another.

428
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,320
You have a lot of wounded people in the 
water,

429
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,420
bleeding,
lot of burns,

430
00:23:12,421 --> 00:23:17,421
and as you all know,
Burns are particularly nasty and 

431
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:20,331
horrible and not enough life jackets,
people floating on flotsam and Jetsam.

432
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,680
The Guy I just mentioned who had to 
here,

433
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:32,030
you know what the dying sailor wanted,
his wife told was named Dr Haynes and 

434
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:36,401
he's quoted by Stanton in the book and 
this incident is particularly 

435
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:36,530
highlighted.
And by the way,

436
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:41,531
um,
people are vomiting because they've 

437
00:23:41,531 --> 00:23:42,620
ingested salt water and fuel oil.
Stanton writes,

438
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:47,621
quote,
a few boys were vomiting violently that 

439
00:23:47,621 --> 00:23:47,621
they

440
00:23:47,621 --> 00:23:49,610
were actually doing somersaults in the 
water trying to keep calm.

441
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,190
Haynes called out here,
right here,

442
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,730
where's the six sailor,
and then he moved into the throng,

443
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,910
about a dozen sailors were holding a 
body aloft and amazing feat of strength 

444
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:05,261
considering that they were all treading 
water furiously to stay afloat beneath 

445
00:24:05,261 --> 00:24:09,221
the added weight,
the man in question was in terrible 

446
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:09,221
shape.
Stanton writes,

447
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:12,680
his eyes had been burned away.
The flesh on his hands was gone,

448
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,880
and what remained were bare tendons.
The boy held him up in an effort to keep

449
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:20,270
these wounds out of the stinging bath of
Saltwater Haynes.

450
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,880
Recognize the man as his good friend in 
liberty,

451
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:27,881
buddy gunnery officer Stanley Lipski.
Miraculously Lipski had made his way 

452
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:31,790
blind from the quarter deck off the ship
and into the water.

453
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,730
Haynes knew that Lipsky's pain must be 
intolerable.

454
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,660
He himself could barely look at his old 
friend who was moaning softly.

455
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:44,020
Stanley he knew was one tough bird.
Hanes also understood that he didn't 

456
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,220
have long to live reluctantly.
He turned away

457
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,490
to those who could actually help end 
quote,

458
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,760
and yet that guy with the burned out 
eyes will make it onto a life raft and 

459
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,610
eventually tell that same doctor,
you know,

460
00:24:57,611 --> 00:25:01,840
what he wants his wife to no last words 
and you know,

461
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,910
get married again after me and all that.

462
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,920
Now I should point out that at this 
point in the story,

463
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:14,750
you know,
it could be a war story from many 

464
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,100
theaters,
many different kinds of conflicts,

465
00:25:15,101 --> 00:25:20,101
over many different arrows.
The part though that is about to happen 

466
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:24,361
now,
the part that inspired me to talk about 

467
00:25:24,361 --> 00:25:24,361
this perhaps tapping into,
you know,

468
00:25:24,361 --> 00:25:28,171
your own secret nightmares is a little 
bit different and no doubt it happened 

469
00:25:29,231 --> 00:25:34,231
many times in history,
not recorded on anyone's parchment or 

470
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:38,800
know logs anywhere,
but this happened in close enough to 

471
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,200
modern times that we have many,
many,

472
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:46,201
many gruesome memories written down by 
survivors of what it was like to go down

473
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:50,470
in the middle of the ocean with sharks 
everywhere.

474
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:55,330
Have you ever seen the drone footage?
Some of it came out recently.

475
00:25:55,331 --> 00:26:00,331
Lee was showing,
I think it was the Florida coast from a 

476
00:26:00,331 --> 00:26:01,420
drone above,
I don't want to say 500 feet,

477
00:26:01,421 --> 00:26:03,310
a thousand feet above just the 
coastline,

478
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:08,311
so it's basically taking pictures 100 
yards off shore and it appears to be 

479
00:26:08,561 --> 00:26:09,940
schools of fish.

480
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,550
That's what it looks like if you're not 
paying close attention.

481
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,080
So you know,
lots of fish.

482
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,850
It's not,
you know,

483
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:19,270
fish in the general term,
I guess it's officially still fish,

484
00:26:19,271 --> 00:26:22,810
but they're sharks and I guess they.
Maybe we're migrating,

485
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:28,020
but the first thing you notice if you're
paying attention to you watch it over 

486
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,721
and over and over again.
Not that I'm obsessed with it or 

487
00:26:30,721 --> 00:26:32,491
anything like that is that most of these
sharks I was reading in the photograph 

488
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:36,070
or in the drone footage are in the four 
to six feet range,

489
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:41,100
kind of a fully grown,
a decent size shark from one of these 

490
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,340
particular breeds of shark.
But you can instantly tell those average

491
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:45,570
size ones,
you know,

492
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,290
every now and then there are big,
big,

493
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:52,291
big ones.
I mean you don't even know what they 

494
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:52,291
are.
Eighteen feet maybe.

495
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:52,291
I mean,
you look at them and there you go.

496
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:52,980
That's three times as long as the other 
one.

497
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,750
Imagine being,
you know,

498
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:02,100
just your paragliding one day off the 
Florida coast and you just splashed down

499
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:07,101
right in the middle of that.
Now there's no guarantee that anything 

500
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:07,680
will happen to you,
right?

501
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:09,330
They may just all scatter and 
frightened.

502
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:12,360
Leave you totally alone,
but they might not.

503
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,320
Now,
what if you're bleeding at the same time

504
00:27:16,321 --> 00:27:18,240
that's going to make any difference or 
wounded.

505
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,440
What if you're there for a long time and
you don't go away?

506
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,820
I mean,
it's one thing to say I crashed,

507
00:27:23,821 --> 00:27:27,210
landed off the coast of Florida into a 
school of sharks and I swam to the shore

508
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:29,010
and I made it out.
Morocco stay alive.

509
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:34,310
You have,
but what have you stayed there for four 

510
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,310
days.

511
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,310
Hm?

512
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,000
Is that a nightmare?

513
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,910
It's a nightmare.
And the daytime.

514
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,770
What happens when you turn out the 
lights on that and what happens when the

515
00:27:43,771 --> 00:27:46,380
sharks start attacking?
Not You,

516
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,220
but people within hearing distance of 
you.

517
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:56,030
The nightmare of the Indianapolis and 
the key part of the monologue that 

518
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,751
Robert Shaw gives us,
the quint character in jaws is what the 

519
00:27:59,751 --> 00:28:03,960
moment when the sharks started attacking
the hundreds of men in the water is like

520
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,230
they can see them underneath them.
I mean,

521
00:28:07,231 --> 00:28:12,231
this is what's so freaky,
is that this water is apparently clear 

522
00:28:12,231 --> 00:28:12,231
to like 40 or 50 feet.
You know,

523
00:28:12,231 --> 00:28:13,770
you're in the tropics.
It's a gorgeous color.

524
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:18,771
As a matter of fact,
it's so bright when the sun starts 

525
00:28:18,771 --> 00:28:20,721
hitting the water that,
that it's blinding people and it's over 

526
00:28:20,721 --> 00:28:24,710
100 degrees in the daytime.
So they're frying the parts that are 

527
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,100
above the water.
If these people have life vests,

528
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:31,430
a bunch of the people who are floating 
in the water with life vests will lose 

529
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,490
everything underneath the water to the 
sharks.

530
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,330
And there are multiple accounts of 
people you know,

531
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,510
tapping a buddy who appears to be 
sleeping in his life,

532
00:28:38,511 --> 00:28:41,640
vest on the water's surface and having,
you know,

533
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:46,641
by the way,
the Quintin jaws actually talks about 

534
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:46,641
this too.
And having them turn over like,

535
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:46,680
uh,
like,

536
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,030
like you know,
bob,

537
00:28:48,031 --> 00:28:50,550
if you will turn over and there's 
nothing below the waist,

538
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:57,450
you can see the sharks below you.
Some of these sailors that a stanton 

539
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:03,010
talks about say that they would see some
of the same sharks and recognize them so

540
00:29:03,011 --> 00:29:08,011
often that they gave them names.
Once Taylor gave a tiger shark of huge 

541
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:08,680
tiger shark,
the name Oscar,

542
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,560
and eventually another stapler took a 
two inch pen knife,

543
00:29:11,561 --> 00:29:12,250
which is,
you know,

544
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:15,280
nothing and tried to stab at one of 
these things.

545
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,340
Some of these sailors were on a raft 
where it was a,

546
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:22,450
the raft was disintegrating over time 
and it had a sort of a lattice floor,

547
00:29:22,451 --> 00:29:27,451
if you will.
And there was a little hole developing 

548
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:30,691
in the floor.
And these big sharks would come up and 

549
00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:30,691
stick their snouts right through.
I mean,

550
00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:31,330
again,
you saw this in jars with jaws,

551
00:29:31,331 --> 00:29:36,331
with the mechanical structure.
Stick their nose right through and try 

552
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:38,821
to get ahold of something.
The sailors started kicking it in the 

553
00:29:38,821 --> 00:29:42,070
face to me being in

554
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,950
the ocean in the middle of the night,

555
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,790
you know,
no land anywhere,

556
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,800
no ships anywhere,
no birds,

557
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:53,160
no planes and sharks all around hundreds
of them.

558
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:58,490
To me,
that is the most terrifying situation I 

559
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:01,611
can think about and what I,
what I was going to do once as I was 

560
00:30:01,611 --> 00:30:04,371
going to do either a book or maybe a TV 
series where the entire premise was 

561
00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:08,991
based around the worst place you can be 
in the world on any given moment in 

562
00:30:08,991 --> 00:30:13,251
history dot January 27th,
1987 and Tunisia the worst place to be 

563
00:30:13,251 --> 00:30:13,251
in the world.
Um,

564
00:30:13,251 --> 00:30:14,760
you know,
the battle of cannae in Italy,

565
00:30:14,761 --> 00:30:15,570
worst place to be,
to work.

566
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,630
This is the worst place to be in the 
world.

567
00:30:18,631 --> 00:30:21,750
To me on that date,
and maybe any date,

568
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,290
it takes a lot of the things that are 
the most nasty things I can think of.

569
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,850
Packages them together in one horrible 
sort of event,

570
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:35,810
and then put these people in this 
psychological challenge where day after 

571
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:40,500
day they're in the water because nobody 
knows they're gone this mission.

572
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,160
So secret delivering the components for 
the bomb meant that they were,

573
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,370
it wasn't like they were totally off the
radar when you read the reports,

574
00:30:47,371 --> 00:30:50,760
it was quite a scandal after the war 
because the Indianapolis going down will

575
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:53,130
be the worst disaster in US Navy 
history.

576
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,120
But there were several sort of,
let's just call them variables maybe.

577
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:57,870
I mean,
first of all,

578
00:30:57,871 --> 00:30:58,680
war,
okay?

579
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:01,680
Variable number one.
But these ships should have been noticed

580
00:31:01,681 --> 00:31:06,681
when they were missing.
They were the number of little things 

581
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:06,681
that happened.
And you can see this,

582
00:31:06,681 --> 00:31:06,810
I mean the Pearl Harbor attacks,
another one where,

583
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,760
a little variable here,
if that doesn't happen,

584
00:31:08,761 --> 00:31:09,970
this doesn't happen.
Um,

585
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,850
I don't want to call it okay,
but you can kind of see how it happened.

586
00:31:14,851 --> 00:31:18,000
And yet what it meant was instead of 
being rescued within a reasonable period

587
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:23,001
of time,
these people are going to be out there 

588
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:23,001
for day after day after day.
They have no water.

589
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:27,680
And eventually think about the 
psychological torture that comes from 

590
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:31,470
being absolutely able to see almost 
nothing but water.

591
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,060
But you will go crazy and then die if 
you start drinking the water around you.

592
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,750
Right?
Again,

593
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:42,080
it's another kind of disaster movie.
It's being stuck in the desert with 

594
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,370
water all around you,
but it's essentially poisonous.

595
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:44,820
Right.

596
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,360
And there will come a time in the story 
where I'm.

597
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,920
And it's funny because it will spread 
from one man to another where people 

598
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,131
will just start drinking the salt water 
and knowingly die or be so crazed from 

599
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,250
Thursday they don't care.

600
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,720
One thing I found particularly 
fascinating about the shark aspect that 

601
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,871
stands and explains in his book was the 
idea that most of these sailors probably

602
00:32:09,031 --> 00:32:14,031
did not have a very clear conception of 
sharks the way we do.

603
00:32:14,041 --> 00:32:16,530
I mean jaws was the big,
you know,

604
00:32:16,531 --> 00:32:21,531
sort of before and after moment on that.
But we've been fascinated with sharks 

605
00:32:21,531 --> 00:32:24,741
ever since.
He points out that it was kind of the 

606
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:26,931
stuff of legends back in this era and 
the idea of confronting one had not been

607
00:32:28,351 --> 00:32:30,870
really talked about very often.
And what's more,

608
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:35,871
he says,
standard says that the navy kind of 

609
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:36,780
downplayed the danger because it wasn't 
good for morale to talk about.

610
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:42,020
Yeah,
you could run into an 18 foot tiger 

611
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,020
shark out there and they'll eat 
anything.

612
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:47,010
Stanton says that initially the sharks 
probably mostly went after the cadavers 

613
00:32:47,411 --> 00:32:51,180
in the water and that's why the real big
attacks did not start for awhile.

614
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:54,340
But then once they ran out of those to 
go after that,

615
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:59,110
they started going after loan floaters 
in the water as opposed to the ones that

616
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:03,400
had all gathered into groups.
And then they would go after the ones at

617
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:05,070
the outside of,
you know,

618
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:10,350
the circle of people floating in the 
water stands and talks about,

619
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,410
you know,
the incident that we just mentioned,

620
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:19,411
the,
a sailor being cut in half below the 

621
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:21,871
waist.
And then says that there was a sailor 

622
00:33:21,871 --> 00:33:22,810
who was on the verge of drowning that 
was calling for help.

623
00:33:22,811 --> 00:33:23,910
And so,
um,

624
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,550
well let me let stand and pick up the 
story.

625
00:33:27,551 --> 00:33:28,240
He writes,
quote,

626
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,860
at one point,
Bob Goss swam away from the group to aid

627
00:33:31,861 --> 00:33:34,310
and exhausted sailor who was on the 
verge of drowning.

628
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:38,120
The boy had clearly gone out of his head
at the site of the fish,

629
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:43,121
meaning the sharks circling below him.
He was waving his hands and calling for 

630
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,250
help.
As Gauze paddled out,

631
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:48,410
he was intercepted immediately by a 
large dorsal fin knifing towards him,

632
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,900
so he swam as fast as he could back to 
the group.

633
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,010
The boy in distressed soon disappeared.
As the shark attacks multiplied,

634
00:33:55,610 --> 00:34:00,610
stanton writes,
the ones optimistic boys were filled 

635
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:03,641
with a sense of helplessness.
Jack Cassidy came face to face with a 

636
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:07,271
tiger shark that had been bothering him 
for so long that he had even given it a 

637
00:34:07,271 --> 00:34:08,390
name.
He called the beast Oscar.

638
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:13,570
He swung at it with a homemade knife and
buried the blade and inch deep in the 

639
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,010
fish's tufts snout,
but Oscar swam away as if only annoyed.

640
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,950
Cassidy was furious.
He wanted to kill the shark,

641
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:23,180
but he was relieved to be left alone.
As the water flashed with twisting tails

642
00:34:23,181 --> 00:34:26,330
and Dorsal fins,
the boys resolve to stay calm,

643
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:30,080
clamping their hands over their ears,
against the erupting screams,

644
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:35,290
but this resolve vanished when one of 
the boys was dragged through the water 

645
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,500
like a fisherman's.
Bob are tugged by a big catfish.

646
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,600
The victim clenched in the uplifted jaws
of a shark was pushed at waist level.

647
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:46,601
Through the surf screaming,
others disappeared quietly without a 

648
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:47,810
trace.
Their life vests shooting back up to the

649
00:34:47,811 --> 00:34:50,480
surface,
empty the straps in shreds.

650
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,090
As the excited sharks grew more 
agitated,

651
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,490
the attacks intensified and ferocity

652
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:56,720
and quote.

653
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:03,660
There are many people who consider the 
shark attacks over several days against 

654
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:09,211
the Indianapolis survivors' to be the 
worst incident of mass shark attacks in 

655
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:15,090
history.
I would suggest that that's a hard one 

656
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:18,601
to know.
Think of how many ships have perished 

657
00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:23,580
over the ages and well,
sharks are not a new phenomenon,

658
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:24,340
right?
Nonetheless,

659
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:29,341
we have very few accounts like that and 
when you add up all the various elements

660
00:35:30,731 --> 00:35:35,731
working on these people,
you just imagine that no one could last 

661
00:35:36,791 --> 00:35:39,810
long in that environment without losing 
their mind.

662
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:42,390
And that's what begins to happen.
And we've seen this before,

663
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:42,960
right?
We did a,

664
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:48,320
we mentioned one guy when we were doing 
blueprint for armageddon in the first 

665
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:48,320
world war,
um,

666
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,340
that,
you know,

667
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,440
it's funny,
what sort of images make it into the 

668
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:54,440
history books and what sort of memories,
right?

669
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,090
So you're in the first world war and 
you're at Passchendaele and you see some

670
00:35:57,091 --> 00:36:02,091
guy stuck in the mud and with all of the
things available to modern society at 

671
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:08,541
that point in time,
they can't get him out and he's begging 

672
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,050
people to help him and no one can do 
anything.

673
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:13,290
So then they come back.
I forgot how many days later it was,

674
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:17,760
it might've only been one day,
but the guy whose memory this was as the

675
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:21,180
guy was still in the mud,
but he'd sunk all the way up to his head

676
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:24,120
and he was insane begging people to 
shoot him.

677
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,640
We all have a limit,
right?

678
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:34,430
So it should not surprise any of us when
some of these people start losing their 

679
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,480
minds in the water under these 
conditions and you know,

680
00:36:36,481 --> 00:36:41,481
you should also point out something 
that's not always apparent when you're 

681
00:36:41,481 --> 00:36:44,151
young,
but as a 52 year old person now is 

682
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:47,691
really apparent to me is how young most 
of these people in this story are in my 

683
00:36:47,691 --> 00:36:48,960
mind,
their kids,

684
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,480
the captains in adult and some of these 
officers are,

685
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,720
you know,
old enough to have young families and 

686
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,461
whatnot.
Although these people were having 

687
00:36:58,461 --> 00:36:58,461
families at 18 years old back then,
a lot of them.

688
00:36:58,461 --> 00:36:59,730
So a lot of them were parents.
But I mean,

689
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:01,980
when you read the biographies of these 
people,

690
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:03,570
I mean,
you know,

691
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:06,000
they're kids to me and you're 18,
19,

692
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:08,970
20,
21 and you're having to deal with this.

693
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,000
I don't agree with von Moltke 
[inaudible] line about,

694
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:18,030
you know,
that we need war because it preserves 

695
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:18,030
these human qualities.
But you sure see them on display here,

696
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,780
don't you?
You wish you'd never have to see them on

697
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:24,781
display again,
but you can't help but marvel that 

698
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:24,781
people can,
you know,

699
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:28,600
get through this and many of them don't.
I mean stanton tell story after story 

700
00:37:29,261 --> 00:37:33,390
about people that consciously decide to 
give up that it's eaten.

701
00:37:33,391 --> 00:37:38,391
Yeah,
I mean even talking about it with other 

702
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:38,391
people who are stuck in the water,
that it's easy to do.

703
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:40,270
All you have to do.
He says his swim away from the group and

704
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:42,520
you will get hit by a shark within 100 
yards.

705
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,160
People will drink the seawater knowing 
it will kill them.

706
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,160
Doug Stanton writes,
quote those with broken arms and legs 

707
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,410
and backs had gone into shock and died.
Others had succumbed to massive bleeding

708
00:37:58,411 --> 00:38:00,870
or head wounds that suspended them in 
another world.

709
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:06,110
Still.
Others simply drowned because they were 

710
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:06,630
too exhausted to keep swimming.
They'd been afloat now without food,

711
00:38:06,631 --> 00:38:07,410
water,
shelter,

712
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:11,640
or sleep for over 40 hours.
Of the 1,196

713
00:38:11,641 --> 00:38:14,670
crew members who'd set sail from Guam 
three days earlier,

714
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:19,860
probably no more than 600 were still 
alive in the previous 24 hours alone.

715
00:38:19,861 --> 00:38:24,861
At least 200 had likely slip beneath the
waves or have been victims of shark 

716
00:38:24,861 --> 00:38:26,370
attack.
Since the sinking he writes,

717
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:31,580
each boy had been floating through the 
hours asking himself the same hard 

718
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:35,331
question.
Will I live or do I quit and it's 

719
00:38:35,331 --> 00:38:38,200
Tuesday unfolded some of the starved 
bleeding and delirious man began to form

720
00:38:38,201 --> 00:38:42,310
their answers for those who gave up 
death now seem to matter of destiny.

721
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,230
They started committing suicide.

722
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,480
Those still lucid enough,
looked on in disbelief.

723
00:38:48,481 --> 00:38:53,481
He writes,
as their former shipmates calmly untied 

724
00:38:53,481 --> 00:38:56,121
their life vests,
took a single stroke forward and sank 

725
00:38:56,121 --> 00:38:59,811
without a word.
Others suddenly turned from the group 

726
00:38:59,811 --> 00:39:00,210
and started swimming,
waiting for a shark to hit,

727
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,790
and then looked up and terrified.
Satisfaction.

728
00:39:02,791 --> 00:39:07,791
When it did,
others simply fell face forward and 

729
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:09,150
refuse to rise.
A boy would swim over to his buddy,

730
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:14,330
lift his head by the hair from the water
and begin screaming for him to come to 

731
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:17,481
his senses.
Often he refused and continued to 

732
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:20,301
quietly drowned himself and quote no.
We should point out that there are 

733
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:26,671
people in every navy and the Second 
World War that saw actual combat that 

734
00:39:26,671 --> 00:39:30,361
had incidents like that and there were 
quite a few people in the merchant 

735
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:32,650
marine and the various civilian versions
that you know,

736
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,380
kept the supplies,
you know,

737
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:39,390
coming across the water and handling the
logistics that would have their ships 

738
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,180
torpedoed,
who would go through similar things.

739
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,960
There's something perversely nasty about
having the water be warm enough to keep 

740
00:39:47,271 --> 00:39:52,271
you alive for days,
so giving you an opportunity to be 

741
00:39:52,271 --> 00:39:55,421
rescued.
You never would have had in the North 

742
00:39:55,421 --> 00:39:57,910
Atlantic for example,
where you'd be dead in an hour or two 

743
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,960
from the hypothermia,
but it also gives you time to go through

744
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:02,750
what stand in just described.
As I said,

745
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,750
multiple disaster movies all wrapped 
into one.

746
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:13,580
Now as the hours drag on,
Stanton says that the delirium starts to

747
00:40:14,961 --> 00:40:19,961
set in and again,
the Indianapolis survivors' are going 

748
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:24,691
through all of these movie tropes that 
forever the movies will wrench drama and

749
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:30,460
emotion and you know,
your sense of feeling for the people.

750
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:33,760
The fake people in these movies are 
stories in the Indianapolis.

751
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:38,230
People are going through it for real.
Their ship went down,

752
00:40:38,231 --> 00:40:40,750
remember it like 12,
15:00

753
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:45,750
AM first thing in the morning,
but in the middle of the night on 

754
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:48,721
Monday,
Stanton writes that by Wednesday the men

755
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:53,970
start attacking one another.
They think they're seeing enemies and at

756
00:40:53,971 --> 00:40:58,971
one point he writes in an a and he says 
in within 10 minutes an estimated 50 

757
00:40:59,911 --> 00:41:04,911
boys were killed by their compatriots 
when everybody snapped at once.

758
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,310
So we have another movie here too.
It's like the shipwreck movie.

759
00:41:08,311 --> 00:41:10,560
So it's another kind of disaster film.
You know,

760
00:41:10,561 --> 00:41:13,620
people are stuck in rafts and dealing 
with sharks and going crazy.

761
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:16,740
Not having.
I mean it says though,

762
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:21,741
we tried to figure out how many things 
you could hit the same people with 

763
00:41:21,741 --> 00:41:21,741
before they broke

764
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,670
the higher human qualities that are 
visible throughout.

765
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,930
I mean the,
the part that got me was as,

766
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,040
as people start dying more and more,
they need their lifevest because the 

767
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,061
life vests are failing.
They're not meant to be in the water 

768
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:41,981
that long.
So you have these stories about people 

769
00:41:41,981 --> 00:41:41,981
that will,
you know,

770
00:41:41,981 --> 00:41:45,071
go over and make sure someone that they 
think is dead has actually expired and 

771
00:41:45,071 --> 00:41:48,260
then take their life vest off.
But the one guy that stanton was quoting

772
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:48,920
in the story,
he just,

773
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:52,160
he would not let them go without some 
sort of a prayer.

774
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:53,640
He'd hold them close,
which you know,

775
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,660
these guys are exhausted by this time.
So anything more than the most minimum 

776
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,560
effort is excruciating.
And he was going to see that each one of

777
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:03,700
these people had a prayer set over them 
before he let them go and you know,

778
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:08,540
to be eaten by the sharks.
I mean those are the little touches in a

779
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:12,440
story like this that break your heart 
because those are the.

780
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:17,450
That's what separates us from just being
some mindless thing that's torn apart by

781
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:22,451
the sharks.
I mean the thinking that goes into all 

782
00:42:22,451 --> 00:42:22,451
of the.
I mean,

783
00:42:22,451 --> 00:42:27,160
that man survived the one that said the 
prayers over the people he had to 

784
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,080
unstrap from the lifevest.
What are you thinking about at night the

785
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:31,040
rest of your life?

786
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:39,010
They will eventually be rescued by a 
pilot that they're not looking for 

787
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:41,690
anybody.
The pilot just kind of sees these people

788
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:42,380
in the water

789
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:43,320
and he,

790
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,780
Stan Lowe and he can see the sharks 
attacking them.

791
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:53,410
Stanton rights of a guy named Lieutenant
Adrian marks who's,

792
00:42:53,411 --> 00:42:55,030
um,
you know,

793
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:00,080
one of the early people on the scene 
once they figure out they've got people 

794
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:00,790
in the water and it's interesting 
because of the secrecy involved in this.

795
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,060
They don't know who these people are.
It's not like they're going,

796
00:43:03,061 --> 00:43:05,630
we found the Indianapolis crew.
One of the first questions they're gonna

797
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,280
ask when they pick the first person up 
is who the hell are you and where you're

798
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:10,320
from.
So a stanton writes,

799
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:15,321
quote,
Lieutenant Adrian marks reached the 

800
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:15,321
scene of the survivors at 3:20
PM.

801
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:18,720
And what he found astounded him,
Lieutenant Atterbury informed marks that

802
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:21,480
there were a great many people scattered
over a wide area.

803
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:25,530
He said not to drop any lifesaving 
equipment until he made a full tour,

804
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,680
which marks quickly did both pilots then
decided to steer away from the people 

805
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,270
clinging to the rafts and to concentrate
on those,

806
00:43:33,271 --> 00:43:36,660
held up solely by vests.
Thirty minutes after he arrived,

807
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,570
marks began bombing the boys with his 
provisions.

808
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,860
About the same time the destroyers,
Ralph Talbot and Madison received orders

809
00:43:43,861 --> 00:43:48,861
to cut short their patrols near the 
island of a leafy and head directly to 

810
00:43:48,861 --> 00:43:48,861
the rescue site.

811
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:53,970
Their ETA 12 hours from the present 
sometime early Friday morning marks knew

812
00:43:53,971 --> 00:43:58,020
the situation was dire from his recon 
altitude of a mere 25 feet.

813
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:03,230
He had a clear view of the deep green.
See in the hundreds of sharks circling 

814
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,440
the men night,
which he knew was the sharks.

815
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:07,570
Normal feeding period was approaching 
one of Mark's,

816
00:44:07,571 --> 00:44:11,580
his crew and watched as a shark attack 
one of the men and dragged him under.

817
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:15,510
As Marx himself witnessed more attacks.
His anxiety grew.

818
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,730
It looked to him as if the survivors 
were so weak,

819
00:44:17,731 --> 00:44:20,700
they couldn't even begin to fight back 
and quote,

820
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,760
and then there's a footnote,
stanton and put in that says,

821
00:44:23,761 --> 00:44:28,761
the sharks had in fact remained a 
constant presence throughout the men's 

822
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:29,460
ordeal.
Even during the daylight hours,

823
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,040
not long after Gwynn who was the first 
pilot

824
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,720
to find the people in the water.
By the way,

825
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:38,840
not long after Gwyn showed up,
a massive shark attack involving an 

826
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,680
estimated 30 fish head in about 15 
minutes,

827
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,560
taken some 60 boys perched on a floater 
net.

828
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,920
And to quote that doesn't begin to even 
do justice to the parts of the story 

829
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:54,540
that seem by comparison with crap like 
that to be nothing.

830
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:59,940
I mean,
how do you talk about no water and how 

831
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:00,420
that makes you feel day after day when 
you're suffering and no decent food.

832
00:45:00,421 --> 00:45:01,870
I mean,
these no sleep,

833
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,850
the wounds.
I mean,

834
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:04,780
they said that one boy and one of these 
rafts,

835
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:09,950
one of the survivors couldn't help but 
point out with sitting there with his 

836
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:12,420
mouth wide open in such pain that he 
couldn't even make a noise.

837
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,900
Um,
you ever been in a situation with a 

838
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:18,720
person like that?
Just one person in one situation,

839
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,620
any one of these things is,
you know,

840
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,930
again,
when you talk about war,

841
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:28,320
the first thing you think about is none 
of this stuff should ever happen again.

842
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,920
And then the next thing you think about 
is that when it does look what people 

843
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,901
can endure and look at what they do in 
terms of self sacrifice for another 

844
00:45:39,421 --> 00:45:41,810
human being who's in a situation,
you know,

845
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,790
that's awful in a situation that you 
yourself might be sharing.

846
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:49,791
So that's when it becomes extra heroic 
when some of these people are doing 

847
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,060
things like giving their life vest to a 
guy who needs it more.

848
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:54,420
It's not like you're doing a good deed 
for someone you found on the street.

849
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:59,750
It's,
it's reducing your own chances of 

850
00:45:59,750 --> 00:45:59,760
survival to help somebody else's chances
of survival.

851
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:05,630
Those are pretty amazing stories and I 
think the reason that we're so 

852
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,181
fascinated with these horrible tales is 
there's something life affirming about 

853
00:46:08,181 --> 00:46:12,801
the people that get through them and not
just how they conducted themselves at 

854
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:15,450
the time,
but how it both changed them and how,

855
00:46:15,451 --> 00:46:15,720
you know,
the,

856
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:20,730
the silent heroism of living with it 
afterwards and I think we have more 

857
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:23,730
understanding of that now than we used 
to with things like ptsd,

858
00:46:23,731 --> 00:46:27,240
but I don't think we even give it 
anywhere near the thought it deserves.

859
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:32,630
I mean,
we all have traumatic memories in our 

860
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:33,240
lives.
Life provide you with some by default,

861
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:36,690
but some people get way more than their 
share.

862
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:41,700
Can you imagine if like plugging 
something in the back of your head,

863
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:46,701
like from the Matrix,
I could upload the memories of one of 

864
00:46:46,701 --> 00:46:50,700
these Indianapolis survivors' into your,
not just your brain,

865
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:55,701
but like have it fused with your 
emotions so you know you have the 

866
00:46:55,701 --> 00:46:58,620
feelings.
You could have the flashbacks from an 

867
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,700
experience you never had.
Imagine what that would do to you pretty

868
00:46:59,701 --> 00:47:01,110
darn quickly,
right?

869
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,410
I just gave you the memories of an 
Indianapolis survivor.

870
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:09,650
Now,
imagine not being able to ever get them 

871
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:12,051
out of your head.
Now imagine going through the original 

872
00:47:12,051 --> 00:47:12,051
experience.
You know,

873
00:47:12,051 --> 00:47:14,430
my brain never wants to ever do any 
research on this personally.

874
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:19,431
You understand,
but I can't help but wonder if somehow 

875
00:47:19,431 --> 00:47:23,300
the cumulative effect over decades of 
all these horrible memories and 

876
00:47:25,621 --> 00:47:30,621
flashbacks and nightmares,
does that ever come to equaling the 

877
00:47:30,621 --> 00:47:34,480
terribleness of the experience itself 
and if it doesn't,

878
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,270
how much of it is like,
you know,

879
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:40,520
picking at the scab continually,
you know,

880
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,060
of the wound that changed your life 
forever.

881
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,610
Now we may not have gone through the 
wound,

882
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:50,611
but think about how upset you'd be just 
having the memories all of a sudden the 

883
00:47:50,611 --> 00:47:53,451
implanted in your head about what it was
like when you got it mentally or 

884
00:47:53,451 --> 00:47:57,010
emotionally speaking.
In my mind when you look at it,

885
00:47:57,011 --> 00:48:02,011
the sinking of the Indianapolis is not 
really a war story.

886
00:48:02,291 --> 00:48:07,291
If it was a war story,
I think maybe we would have included it 

887
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:09,661
in the series that we're doing on the 
Pacific war and the war in Asia in the 

888
00:48:09,661 --> 00:48:12,520
Second World War right now,
but it's not like that in my mind.

889
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:17,760
It's about as connected to war as I see 
it as the nine slash 11 attacks were 

890
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,580
connected to terrorism.
They are the thing that creates,

891
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:26,790
you know,
the first domino falling in a number of 

892
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:28,540
horrible incidents.
But once the initial attacks happen,

893
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:32,530
you go from having a war movie,
if you'll pardon the connection again to

894
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:36,040
entertainment to a disaster film,
you know,

895
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,260
like the kind I grew up with and as I 
said,

896
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:43,860
what is.
So I don't know if amazing is a good 

897
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:44,320
word to use in such a horrific 
situation.

898
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:49,321
What is so frightful about what the 
Indianapolis survivors' and non 

899
00:48:49,321 --> 00:48:53,650
survivors had to go through is they 
don't get to just have one disaster film

900
00:48:53,651 --> 00:48:54,920
be,
you know,

901
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,850
they're traumatic memory.
They get to walk out on one of these,

902
00:48:58,450 --> 00:48:59,530
you know,
movies like,

903
00:48:59,531 --> 00:48:59,790
you know,

904
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,140
the towering inferno and get right on,
you know,

905
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:07,230
the Poseidon and then they get to 
experience the poseidon adventure as one

906
00:49:07,231 --> 00:49:08,730
right after another.
It is as though,

907
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,950
you know,
the great gods of history,

908
00:49:10,951 --> 00:49:15,951
we're trying to see exactly how much 
they could pile on the same group of 

909
00:49:15,951 --> 00:49:17,310
human beings and since we're going to do
a study here,

910
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:22,311
why not have hundreds of people in your 
sample size and see how much they can 

911
00:49:22,311 --> 00:49:23,640
take and what happens to them,
you know,

912
00:49:23,641 --> 00:49:28,641
as you continue to give them as much 
material as some of the people we pity 

913
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:32,130
them most for going through terrible 
human experiences.

914
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,570
What several of them put together,
experienced.

915
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:38,820
That's why for me,
if you're talking about,

916
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,060
you know,
terrible places in human history to have

917
00:49:42,061 --> 00:49:47,061
found yourself in or if your time 
machine happens to go awry and you hit 

918
00:49:47,061 --> 00:49:48,960
the button wrong and you end up in just 
about the worst place you could.

919
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:54,470
For me,
that would be anywhere from about July 

920
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:54,470
30th to August,
second,

921
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:54,600
19,
45,

922
00:49:55,350 --> 00:50:00,180
a couple hundred miles from the nearest 
land in the Philippines sea,

923
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:02,640
and I would definitely say if that 
happened to you,

924
00:50:02,641 --> 00:50:07,641
you would have found yourself for that 
particular time and place in the worst 

925
00:50:07,641 --> 00:50:07,641
place in the world.

926
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,060
Audible has the largest selection of 
audio books on the planet.

927
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:21,180
What more do you need to know?
Really than that,

928
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:24,780
when audible started sponsoring our 
programs,

929
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:28,400
they were in a similar situation to 
where if somebody said,

930
00:50:28,401 --> 00:50:33,401
well you do.
I said a podcaster and then had to 

931
00:50:33,401 --> 00:50:33,401
explain that for a long time.
Well,

932
00:50:33,401 --> 00:50:37,631
once upon a time,
audio books were something that people 

933
00:50:37,631 --> 00:50:40,751
had to have explained to them.
Now everybody understands audio books 

934
00:50:40,751 --> 00:50:42,770
and so everyone understands audible,
the leading provider and.

935
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:44,990
Well,
to give you an idea of selection,

936
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:46,940
if you're ever worried about that sort 
of thing.

937
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:52,210
They have multiple books and I mean I 
stopped counting at like five on the USS

938
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:59,500
Indianapolis sinking,
so let's just call it an unmatched 

939
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,680
selection and if the story you just 
heard acts as an appetizer towards 

940
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,020
finding out more and there's a lot more 
audibles got plenty to choose from.

941
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:11,020
In fact,
they actually have the book we quoted 

942
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:11,330
from Stanton's book in harm's way,
which I've read in is incredible,

943
00:51:11,331 --> 00:51:14,120
but there's a bunch of other ones too.
If you read that or heard this story,

944
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,710
uh,
you can get granular.

945
00:51:15,711 --> 00:51:16,400
I mean,
um,

946
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:19,430
there's a new book that just came out on
the Indianapolis,

947
00:51:19,431 --> 00:51:21,440
so you want some more information on 
this.

948
00:51:21,441 --> 00:51:26,441
You want to have somebody speak to you 
for a little bit longer than this one 

949
00:51:26,441 --> 00:51:26,441
lasted.
Well,

950
00:51:26,441 --> 00:51:28,790
why don't you go to audible,
sign up for their free trial,

offer audible.com
forward slash Carlin.

952
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:33,560
Text my name,
do five,

953
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:34,400
zero,
zero five,

954
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:36,050
zero,
zero to get started.

955
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,180
And you can download one,
two,

956
00:51:38,181 --> 00:51:43,181
three.
I think I stopped counting at four or 

957
00:51:43,181 --> 00:51:44,180
five books that they have on the sinking
of the USS Indianapolis.

958
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:49,181
It's just one of those stories that it's
so hard to believe that it's true,

959
00:51:49,251 --> 00:51:50,450
and as I said,
you know,

960
00:51:50,451 --> 00:51:54,230
there's almost this vicarious horror 
movie fascination with it,

961
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:57,320
and then it just breaks your heart to 
actually think that no,

962
00:51:57,321 --> 00:52:02,321
this is real stuff and the basic 
information you're getting comes from 

963
00:52:02,321 --> 00:52:02,810
the mouths of the people who were 
experiencing this,

964
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,160
but that's what makes history so 
compelling.

965
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,610
At least two people who have whatever it
is,

966
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:15,790
the gene or just a sense of the dramatic
and there's a reason that this story 

967
00:52:17,091 --> 00:52:21,590
continues to both fascinated but also 
inspire.

968
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,220
Why don't you go to audible,

I mean,

972
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:35,540
I've talked about every angle that 
audible has in terms of advantages.

973
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:40,780
In the old days,
these were the things that were new and 

974
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:40,780
unusual.
Now you just sort of expect this sort of

975
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:45,221
stuff from your audio book provider 
because audible's the one that came up 

976
00:52:45,221 --> 00:52:46,430
with all this stuff and made this the 
standard.

977
00:52:46,431 --> 00:52:47,870
You want to own your books.
