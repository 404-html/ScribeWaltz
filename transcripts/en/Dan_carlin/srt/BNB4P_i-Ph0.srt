1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,140
It's hardcore history.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,060
I've been podcasting since like the 
Stone Age,

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,570
2005 and way back then and for a long 
time afterwards I kind of considered all

4
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:21,901
the other people who were podcasting as 
my colleagues were not really in the 

5
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:22,660
sort of industry where you,
so yes,

6
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:27,661
my colleagues and we published papers or
whatever the normal idea of of what you 

7
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:28,540
might consider a colleague to be,
but it really felt the same.

8
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:33,541
Right.
You're struggling through the same 

9
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,861
things,
learning the same thing as running into 

10
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:36,661
each other in places either in person or
digitally these days.

11
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:42,061
Of course it's a lot harder to call 
every podcast or your colleague when I 

12
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:44,020
think I saw a number recently that it's 
north of 500,000

13
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:49,021
podcast or something,
but the person I'm about to talk to is 

14
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:51,190
undoubtedly my podcast colleague 
because,

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,640
well heck,
he's a history podcast or so right 

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:56,640
there.
We're in a pretty pretty small gene pool

17
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,250
and he is one of the great podcasters 
ever is the history of Rome.

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,620
PODCAST is legendary in my mind.
It sort of makes him the audio,

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,800
the modern audio equivalent of Edward 
Gibbon,

20
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:14,290
where he,
he goes into like the length and breadth

21
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:19,291
of the entire Roman experience to the 
fall of the western empire.

22
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,440
It's hugely popular and one of those 
podcasts that should be in some section 

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,311
of the hall of fame someday.
His other one is an amazingly ambitious 

24
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:31,360
project,
which he pulls off wonderfully.

25
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,310
And judging from the success,
uh,

26
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,970
everyone seems to like revolutions where
he looks at different revolutions.

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,600
So it'll be very interesting to talk to 
Mike Duncan today about his new book,

28
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,210
the storm before the storm.
And if you don't know enough about this,

29
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,020
his book will educate you wonderfully.
He show,

30
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:55,360
of course is available out there.
We did a,

31
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,420
the longest series we ever did was on 
this period of Roman history in death 

32
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,360
throes of the republic.
So there's lots of stuff out there,

33
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,750
but I have a feeling most of you are 
already going to know a ton of this 

34
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,241
stuff because Rome is wildly popular,
which is one of the first questions I 

35
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:12,640
ask my history,
podcast colleague,

36
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,960
the Great Mike Duncan.

37
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,710
Once upon a time I wanted to do a 
podcast on Cleopatra and I sat down,

38
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,060
decided it,
ordered a bunch of books,

39
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:32,061
and then tried to figure out where you 
should start the story of Cleopatra and 

40
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:36,741
every time I would go backwards I would 
find a domino connected to another 

41
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:38,790
domino.
And another domino long story short that

42
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:43,791
show I wanted to do Cleopatra about,
or the show I wanted to do about 

43
00:02:43,791 --> 00:02:48,021
Cleopatra turned into the longest series
we've ever done because you have to go 

44
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:49,790
all the way back to,
uh,

45
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,710
a long way in Roman history for the 
dynamics to become,

46
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,160
you know,
even remotely clear and people tend to 

47
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,160
focus on,
you know,

48
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,550
if this is the titanic story,
the actual sinking of the ship.

49
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,600
But Mike,
your new book,

50
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:06,601
the storm before the storm is about the 
iceberg and the striking of the iceberg,

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,410
you know,
tell us a little bit about,

52
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,580
you know,
this story that most people don't know 

53
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:13,580
as well as the actual sinking of the 
ship.

54
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,520
Yeah.
The way that I put it in my book is the 

55
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,641
storm before the storm,
the beginning of the end of the Roman 

56
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:24,510
republic,
and it covers the period from 1:46

57
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:29,511
BC around there to about 78 BC,
which is the death of Sala and it covers

58
00:03:30,121 --> 00:03:33,810
the couple of generations before Julius 
Caesar comes along,

59
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:37,650
before Octavian comes along,
before Antony and Cleopatra are around,

60
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,130
um,
to start looking as you say it,

61
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,500
the things that led up to the collapse 
of the Roman republic rather than just 

62
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,340
jumping right into it and you say it's,
you know,

63
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,350
people like to focus on the sinking of 
the ship.

64
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:50,610
And I say,
uh,

65
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:55,780
that,
that jumping into Cesar is like jumping 

66
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:55,780
into a movie,
uh,

67
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:55,780
at,
at the third act,

68
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,960
at the beginning of the third act where 
you,

69
00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:57,810
you know,
everything is,

70
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:03,130
you know,
loud and crazy and people are fighting 

71
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,211
with each other.
And obviously people are really 

72
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:05,211
passionately committed to this,
that,

73
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,961
or the other thing.
But you don't know how it got to this 

74
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:08,961
point.
You don't know what,

75
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:13,031
what were the,
what were the problems that led the 

76
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:15,981
republic to be so brittle that it could 
be blown apart a couple of generations 

77
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:20,691
later and that's what I hope that the 
book is able to explore and then when 

78
00:04:20,691 --> 00:04:22,180
you read it and you have completed with 
it,

79
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,550
then you'll have a much richer 
understanding of why we,

80
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,500
why what happens with Caesar happens.

81
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,200
Let's talk about why we even care what 
happens to Caesar.

82
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:38,201
I'm a little amazed at the not just 
modern but ongoing public interest and 

83
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:43,340
remember a public that is generally not 
thought to be all that history,

84
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:48,341
knowledgeable or even cared that much 
about it and yet we can continually 

85
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:50,210
publish books and make movies and and 
have discussions that,

86
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:55,340
that draw comparisons to this republic 
for more than 2000 years ago.

87
00:04:55,341 --> 00:05:00,341
What do you think accounts for the 
enduring interest on the part of even 

88
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,930
lay people to this place where if you 
think about it,

89
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:07,931
no one should even be.
They shouldn't be in the front of 

90
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:07,931
anyone's mind.
Fifteen hundred,

91
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:08,540
2000 years ago.

92
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,530
It's a.
it's a good question.

93
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,650
I mean,
like,

94
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,960
for,
for people like us,

95
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,360
you know,
it's just,

96
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,270
it's so inherently interesting that it's
almost weird to step back and say like,

97
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:23,110
why would anybody be interested in Rome 
because Rome is,

98
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:25,480
at least to me.
So inherently interesting.

99
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,190
Um,
I think what it gets to is that people 

100
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,660
have,
people know that Rome was this ancient,

101
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,870
powerful civilization and it almost is 
the epitome of what a imperial power is,

102
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:46,381
what civilizational power is.
We know that it lasted for a thousand 

103
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:47,230
years or more if you include the 
byzantines.

104
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,560
So I think it's,
I think Rome is always going to have a 

105
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,520
place in the collective imagination as 
you go.

106
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:59,521
Okay.
What if you're at all interested in 

107
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:01,930
history at all?
Let's go to sort of the big and 

108
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,821
important parts of history and um,
you're always going to then wind up in 

109
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:07,610
Rome and specifically where people are 
going to wind up is that,

110
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,640
is that era between,
let's say the arrival of Julius Caesar 

111
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,570
and like the death of Nero ran at the 
death of the Julio Cottey and dynasty,

112
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:19,571
that particular era of Roman history in 
part because it's so well documented and

113
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,500
we know so much about it,
uh,

114
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,940
is always going to be the place where 
people go a to.

115
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,030
If they become interested in Rome,
that's where they're going to wind up.

116
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,310
And it's a lot the same way that I think
that no matter what,

117
00:06:32,311 --> 00:06:37,311
like the Napoleonic age is going to be 
permanently something that people keep 

118
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,140
going back to and back to even 2000 
years later.

119
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:39,590
And you're like,
wow,

120
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:41,340
this is just like some obscure,
you know,

121
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,780
kind of temporary French empire.
There is,

122
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:48,140
there is something about the force of 
the personalities and the force of the,

123
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,600
the political power that is being 
expressed.

124
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:52,390
That's always going to draw people's 
attention.

125
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:53,700
You know,
I,

126
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,880
I,
I see that with Napoleon just like I see

127
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:58,750
that with a Hitler or,
or even the Genghis Khan,

128
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,760
but,
but to me the difference is the length 

129
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,461
of it instead of one supreme figure that
that is searing across the pages of the 

130
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:10,490
history book and there are innately 
interesting.

131
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,310
You have numerous figures.
I mean,

132
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:18,311
just going through your book,
it's one fascinating individual that 

133
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,520
seems to be almost.
Well,

134
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,540
I mean,
when you think about what the quota of 

135
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,200
great men should be in any given 
civilization during any given time,

136
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,500
the period disgusting.
Your book seems to be an era where 

137
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,980
humanity in that place,
in that time is exceeding its normal 

138
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,760
quota of fascinating August human 
beings.

139
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,390
I would say.
So.

140
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,630
And it's always been a bit surprising to
me.

141
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,300
Uh,
you know,

142
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,470
having gone through the history of Rome 
and you know,

143
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,230
gone through the entire history of Rome 
and pretty minute detail,

144
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,770
um,
that,

145
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,780
that particular period between the Pi 
and then Maurice and Sala was always,

146
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,010
um,
who was always a period that I wanted to

147
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,020
come back to.
Like I,

148
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,090
I kinda had to put a pin in it very 
early on and was like,

149
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:03,540
you know,
this is,

150
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:08,570
this is an era that's gonna be a lot.
It's going to be worth coming back to 

151
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,060
and to have nobody really have written 
the book that I wrote,

152
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:16,410
which is let's just focus on this 50 or 
60 year period all on its own.

153
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:21,411
I won't make this the first couple of 
chapters and a larger book about the 

154
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:21,411
fall of the republic.

155
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:24,480
I won't make it one chapter in a larger 
history about,

156
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,010
you know,
just Roman civilization.

157
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:28,890
But to really like hone in on this 
particular period.

158
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,010
You know,
I would,

159
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,910
I,
I'd always kind of,

160
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,950
I would watch the lists with one I like 
if somebody going to finally discover 

161
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,410
that this is a great untapped wealth of 
material,

162
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,880
um,
and nobody,

163
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,680
nobody quite put it together.
So I was able to step in and,

164
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:46,730
and now I hope deliver a book that will 
explain why.

165
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,380
I think when people end the book,
they're going to be like,

166
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:51,390
why hasn't this been covered in more 
detail?

167
00:08:51,391 --> 00:08:53,940
I think that'll be one of the big 
questions coming out of it for people.

168
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,500
Yeah.
I love your subtitle,

169
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,480
the beginning of the end of the Roman 
republic.

170
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,590
It sounds Churchill,
Ian,

171
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:00,240
but you maybe you could have called it 
also,

172
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,290
um,
you know,

173
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:06,160
the era when things broke because that 
way that really is kind of what it was,

174
00:09:06,161 --> 00:09:11,161
you know,
and you can see like you were talking 

175
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:11,161
about in the book,
they,

176
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:11,161
the Romans didn't have this written 
constitution.

177
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:15,801
They had sort of a set of conduct rules 
that were just innately understood by 

178
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:19,560
everyone in customs.
And when they broke that,

179
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:20,280
it's like,
okay,

180
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:25,281
there is no written constitution.
So once someone violates the way we do 

181
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:25,710
things right,
the way of the elders,

182
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,000
uh,
all bets are off,

183
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:29,140
right?
It seemed that way.

184
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,230
Um,
were there,

185
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:36,270
there was,
there was this thing like when Rome 

186
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:36,670
triumphs and,
and what happens in 1:46

187
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:38,080
BC for people that aren't,
like,

188
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:43,081
caught up with this is that Rome 
conquered carthage for the last time.

189
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,260
Their great rival.

190
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,090
I mean Hannibal during the second punic 
war,

191
00:09:46,091 --> 00:09:49,640
that's about 50 years or so in the past.
Um,

192
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,930
but they're,
they're great rivalry with carthage is 

193
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:54,930
now over and Rome has emerged 
victorious.

194
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:59,220
They also decide to just outright 
conquer and annex grease into the Roman 

195
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,150
state.
So at this point in 1:46

196
00:10:01,151 --> 00:10:06,151
BC,
Rome is without question the strongest 

197
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:09,541
power in the Mediterranean world and 
nobody's going to be able to challenge 

198
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:13,261
them.
There is something about this trial 

199
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:16,450
actually opens up a whole host of new 
problems for the Republican,

200
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:21,451
for the leadership of the product that 
they just sort of start to fail to 

201
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:24,300
address and fail to deal with.
And it creates a powerfully new,

202
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:29,310
like confrontational style of domestic 
politics that had never really existed 

203
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:34,171
before.
The Roman Senate and the Roman elites 

204
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:34,570
had always been pretty clubby with each 
other.

205
00:10:34,571 --> 00:10:35,620
They had always been like,
oh,

206
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:36,720
there are some,
you know,

207
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,100
will ultimately make compromises with 
each other.

208
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,110
Or you know,
if we don't all agree on something,

209
00:10:41,111 --> 00:10:42,610
we'll just,
we'll just put it to bed.

210
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,180
And what happens after 1:46
is you start having these leaders start 

211
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,361
to break away and start to tap into new 
energies that are floating around out 

212
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:55,351
there.
And with this new confrontational style 

213
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:55,351
of Roman politics,
yeah,

214
00:10:55,351 --> 00:11:00,091
people start abandoning those old 
unwritten norms and unspoken a modes of 

215
00:11:00,671 --> 00:11:03,490
behavior.
And once you start down that road,

216
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:06,320
I mean tell you can,
you can pull out of it what,

217
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:08,950
what happened to the Romans is that they
were not able to pull out of it.

218
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:14,490
And if you start going down this road,
you ultimately discovered that even 

219
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,420
written laws,
even following written laws,

220
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,330
is merely accustomed.
It's merely a norm.

221
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,260
Um,
there's no,

222
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:25,290
there's nothing about a piece of paper 
with laws written on it that compels me 

223
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,460
to do anything to follow that law.
I'm just simply,

224
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:31,060
I'm giving it power with my own because 
that's how we do things.

225
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:34,140
But if somebody say as a,
you know,

226
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,570
an army or a gun or a baseball bat,
you know,

227
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,590
that actually is the ultimate definer of
power.

228
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:46,710
It's just brute force.
So once you start giving up on sort of 

229
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:46,710
what you would call,
oh,

230
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,510
minor unspoken rules,
you eventually will get to the point 

231
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,220
where everybody has to admit that only 
brute force is really what's at play.

232
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,160
You know,
I love that line,

233
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,110
whether it was really sad or not that,
you know,

234
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:03,230
history doesn't repeat,
but it sometimes rhymes and I look at 

235
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,430
the Roman republic,
I think like everyone does and you know,

236
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:07,390
it's hard not to see,
um,

237
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:12,710
patterns and,
and similar dynamics and I think if for 

238
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,630
no other reason than because it's 
another commercial republic that's large

239
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:20,631
and imperial and right there you're 
going to have some things that look 

240
00:12:20,631 --> 00:12:21,060
similar and we all understand that if 
you look a little beneath the surface,

241
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:22,560
there's a ton of things that are 
different.

242
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,080
I mean slavery outright,
slavery for example.

243
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:30,410
But you point out in your book,
and I thought it was interesting you 

244
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,661
were,
you were drawn comparisons to if the US 

245
00:12:32,661 --> 00:12:36,060
and the Roman republic are following a 
similar charted course,

246
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:41,090
for lack of a better word,
where would we be now in terms of where 

247
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,810
the Romans were?
Can you talk a little about that?

248
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:43,830
Because I thought that was.
I mean,

249
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:46,620
if you look at the punic wars is like 
the world wars and whatnot,

250
00:12:46,621 --> 00:12:49,680
I think it's a fascinating way to come 
up to a conclusion saying,

251
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,880
okay,
we've done this,

252
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:51,960
we've done this,
we've done this,

253
00:12:51,961 --> 00:12:56,961
we haven't done this yet.
So where do you put us in the book 

254
00:12:56,961 --> 00:12:56,961
compared to,
um,

255
00:12:56,961 --> 00:12:59,070
Roman history in a similar place.

256
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,570
Right?
So all,

257
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:06,571
all caveats aside that this isn't,
this is not actually the way that 

258
00:13:06,571 --> 00:13:07,860
history works.
We're not like in some.

259
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,620
That's right.
We're speculating wildly and it responds

260
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,700
to absolutely.
Right.

261
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,030
So that's what I do.
Mike,

262
00:13:15,031 --> 00:13:16,050
Welcome to my show.
Yeah.

263
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,700
Um,
okay.

264
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:23,701
So let's say that the Roman Empire is 
out there and there was like a thousand 

265
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:28,320
years worth of history and we're sitting
here in the United States or in the 

266
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,981
West.
Generally at the beginning of the 21st 

267
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:31,981
century.
You want to say like,

268
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:31,981
w,
w what,

269
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,050
what is there that we can look to in 
Roman history is,

270
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,080
is there a period in time that we can 
look to that is more analogous to our 

271
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,400
own situation than another and it,
it's really,

272
00:13:42,401 --> 00:13:45,760
it's a lot by process of elimination,
uh,

273
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,700
where,
you know,

274
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,670
are we a brand new little city state 
that has just recently been colonized or

275
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:52,780
founded by,
you know,

276
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:56,290
a group of a dissident and vagabonds and
escaped slaves,

277
00:13:56,291 --> 00:14:01,291
like know that,
that happened 400 years ago in our own 

278
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:01,291
history.
That would be,

279
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,640
you know,
the early days of the colonization of 

280
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:06,640
North America.
Uh,

281
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,530
are we at a stage where a group of 
disgruntled aristocrats overthrows the 

282
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:14,611
king and establishes a new king list 
republic that is more or less an elite 

283
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:16,180
lead oligarchy.

284
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,470
Like,
no,

285
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,910
that would be,
if anything,

286
00:14:18,911 --> 00:14:19,440
that's,
that's,

287
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,620
you know,
that's the founding fathers,

288
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:23,120
that's the American revolution.
Um,

289
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,730
then what Rome does is,
is it emerges as,

290
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,240
as a new republic and over the next 
couple of hundred years,

291
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:33,070
it starts to expand slowly across Italy 
in a series of a series of wars.

292
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:38,071
There collectively dub the Sam night 
wars that wind up with Rome being the 

293
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:41,710
most dominant power in the Italian 
peninsula on the Italian peninsula.

294
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,030
So it was the United States a recently 
emerged regional power.

295
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,010
Um,
I,

296
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:52,020
again,
I don't think that anybody would 

297
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,671
describe the United States as a recently
emerged regional power and all of that 

298
00:14:53,671 --> 00:14:54,560
probably corresponds to,
you know,

299
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,710
our slow and steady conquest of North 
America and everything that we did to 

300
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,950
the American Indians,
uh,

301
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,300
battling with Mexico and taking their,
the entire north half of their country.

302
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,970
And then you even get later on and you 
say,

303
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:13,390
well,
after that Rome goes to war with 

304
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:13,390
Carthage,
goes to war with Greece,

305
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,050
goes to war in Spain,
and they emerge as this dominant,

306
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:20,170
what you might call a global power,
at least in the context of the 

307
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:20,170
Mediterranean.

308
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,670
And again,
the United States isn't even there 

309
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:24,670
because we did all of that.
Uh,

310
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,060
we are one of the acknowledged great 
powers.

311
00:15:26,061 --> 00:15:29,030
And especially after the Cold War in the
19 nineties,

312
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,990
you were describing the United States as
a hyper power almost.

313
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:34,970
And I think that's been tempered quite a
bit in the last few years,

314
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:39,971
but certainly we're not finding our 
footing for the first time as a global 

315
00:15:39,971 --> 00:15:41,240
power.
We've been dealing with those issues.

316
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:41,970
Um,
you know,

317
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:44,150
since the end of world war two and all 
through the Cold War.

318
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,300
So then you push forward a little bit 
more and you say,

319
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:49,040
okay,
well has the republic,

320
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,960
you know,
have we collapsed into a,

321
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,240
you know,
a generations long civil war war,

322
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,320
a war Lord has in effect a emerged 
victorious from and set himself up as a 

323
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:01,040
dictator.
No,

324
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,160
that hasn't happened yet.
So if we haven't gotten to that point 

325
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,770
yet,
if the republic has not yet collapsed,

326
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:09,710
and I certainly don't believe that the 
republic has collapsed.

327
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,990
Um,
then you say,

328
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:16,991
okay,
well maybe the United States is kind of 

329
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:19,001
now roughly in this same setting where 
after Rome had emerged as a global 

330
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:20,030
power,
but before the republic collapsed,

331
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,400
let's,
let's take a look at this era.

332
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:24,500
It's the beginning of the end of the 
republic,

333
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,630
which is right after this period,
1:46

334
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:31,631
BC,
which as we said earlier in the show 

335
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:34,770
earlier in this interview was because 
already a period that is inherently 

336
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,740
fascinating in its own right.
And as it turns out,

337
00:16:36,741 --> 00:16:41,741
I think that they were dealing with a 
number of issues that you could say the 

338
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:44,240
United States is dealing with right now.
And so it's worth going through what the

339
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:47,000
Romans went through and how they 
responded to it.

340
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:48,140
And maybe it could,
um,

341
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,440
maybe it could influence how we decide 
to deal with our own problems.

342
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:51,740
Today.

343
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:57,570
I was playing a silly game while I was 
reading your book is to remind me of a 

344
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,660
bunch of things that I haven't,
I haven't looked at in a while and,

345
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:04,661
and the battles over public land and the
distribution of land to veterans and all

346
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:07,450
that stuff in the problem that the 
Romans were having,

347
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,690
keeping armies in the field when they 
were essentially,

348
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,570
you know,
conscripts is not really the right word,

349
00:17:13,571 --> 00:17:17,380
but farmer armies that had to go home 
and tend to their home.

350
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:22,710
We're now on long service,
a thousand miles away from home and the 

351
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,400
farm's going to hack and how long can 
you maintain?

352
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:25,540
And I thought,
you know,

353
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:30,690
if we tried to run our current foreign 
policy in the United States with a 

354
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,330
military that was operating with the 
draft situation that we had,

355
00:17:34,331 --> 00:17:37,870
say in the 19 fifties,
I don't know if we could do it,

356
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,320
how much does the dynamic of having,
um,

357
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,440
you know,
a bunch of veterans coming home from 

358
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:46,570
these wars and having,
you know,

359
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:51,571
real gripes about the situation that 
they find themselves in the fact that 

360
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,731
they might have to go back in service.
The fact that their homes are falling 

361
00:17:55,731 --> 00:17:56,940
apart while they're gone.
Talk to talk a little about that dynamic

362
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:57,180
check.

363
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:02,860
Reminds me a little the fry core in 
Germany or the bonus marchers in our own

364
00:18:02,861 --> 00:18:03,400
history.
I mean,

365
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,690
a bunch of long service military 
veterans angry with nothing to do.

366
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,000
Sounds like a recipe for,
um,

367
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,050
political change.

368
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,980
Yeah,
I would,

369
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:18,100
I would say so.
And what what is happening is it's one 

370
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,410
of these situations where,
again,

371
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:21,590
the Romans or had been more or less 
running,

372
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,920
what you might call a glorified militia 
were you were,

373
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,140
you were,
you would enter into the service,

374
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:28,410
you would actually,
if,

375
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,890
if,
yeah,

376
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,230
if harvest time came and everybody was 
still fighting each other,

377
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:36,231
like both sides would quit the field and
everybody would go home and harvest 

378
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:39,491
their fields.
And these imperial wars of expansion 

379
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:41,330
that Rome got caught in a yes,
starts to take the poor,

380
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:43,910
the lower class citizens away from their
farms,

381
00:18:43,911 --> 00:18:46,550
away from their families for longer and 
longer periods of time.

382
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,200
And so this period of triumph is for 
the,

383
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,480
for the Roman state,
for the republic itself as an entity.

384
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,200
The Senate and the people of Rome,
um,

385
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:02,020
turns out to be fairly economically 
disastrous for a lot of these lower 

386
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,140
class a Roman citizens.

387
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,060
They're going to start to lose their 
farms.

388
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,000
They're going to start to get bought out
by wealthy neighbors because you take,

389
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,030
you know,
you'd rather take some money and get out

390
00:19:11,031 --> 00:19:13,130
while you can then watch it all go to 
ruin.

391
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,190
So yeah,
it really does.

392
00:19:15,191 --> 00:19:15,920
And the,
and the bonus,

393
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,380
the bonus marchers are a good example of
this,

394
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:21,560
um,
which happened right before,

395
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,100
you know,
right,

396
00:19:22,101 --> 00:19:27,101
right in the midst of the Great 
Depression here in the United States is 

397
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:28,280
that they,
they had these grievances,

398
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:33,281
they had these legitimate grievances,
their families had had these farms for 

399
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:34,250
in perpetuity,
you know,

400
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:39,251
going back into the misty eras of the 
early republic or even the kingdom days 

401
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:41,060
and they've,
they're now starting to lose all of that

402
00:19:41,061 --> 00:19:46,061
and their traditional ways of life are 
being upset and they are feeling that 

403
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:50,740
the Senate and the government of Rome is
a,

404
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,780
they are consolidating all of this 
massive imperial wealth.

405
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,200
But none of it seems to be trickling 
down to the poor farmers,

406
00:19:57,201 --> 00:20:00,810
to the poorer citizens.
So you have a,

407
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,840
you have a situation where these new 
leaders,

408
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:03,920
as I was saying,
you can,

409
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,710
you can start to break out and say,
hey,

410
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,630
I as a,
as a noble leader,

411
00:20:08,631 --> 00:20:09,290
you can say,
Hey,

412
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:12,290
I think that there's an opportunity for 
me here to,

413
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,870
uh,
get enormous political influence and 

414
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:20,611
political power and political popularity
by promising these people who have all 

415
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:21,170
these grievances.
I'm going to,

416
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,750
I'm going to solve your problems.
We're going to go to the rich.

417
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,990
We're going to take their land by 
basically by force.

418
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,140
We're going to chop it up and we're 
going to redistribute it to all of you.

419
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:32,960
This is an incredibly popular thing that
can be done.

420
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:37,961
And this opens the new,
like pop goolarri style of Roman 

421
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:42,431
politics,
which is instead of this elite noble 

422
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:43,730
consensus being the driver of your 
policies,

423
00:20:43,731 --> 00:20:48,731
it's directly appealing to the rural 
peasants in the urban plebs who are 

424
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:53,521
feeling negative effects from Rome's 
imperial tramp rather than a bunch of 

425
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:53,770
positive effects.

426
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,680
Well,
and it brings up the age old question.

427
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,320
I'd like to get your opinion on it.
As a guy who's talked about roam as much

428
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:03,070
or more than anyone,
I can think of the idea that,

429
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,200
that these people who appealed to the 
popular crowd or were they really,

430
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:11,890
was that,
was that a real position or was that,

431
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,620
you know,
they just had latched onto a political,

432
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,400
uh,
uh,

433
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:17,380
when they put their finger in the wind,
find out,

434
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:22,381
oh,
this cause of giving land to the 

435
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:22,381
veterans is popular.
So I'll do that.

436
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,740
It seems to me that,
that if I look at it as a,

437
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:28,741
as a novice,
some of these reformers look more real 

438
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:29,700
than others.
Um,

439
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,000
do you have a feeling?
I mean like,

440
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,840
uh,
a ks and Tiberias groggy.

441
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:38,850
I mean,
to me those seem people always like to 

442
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:39,010
compare them to the Kennedy brothers 
that that's ridiculous.

443
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:41,890
But at the same time you have two 
brothers both assassinated,

444
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:47,070
uh,
both that a lot of people were able to 

445
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,230
romantically put a lot of hopes in and,
and lionize afterwards.

446
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,420
I mean,
do you look at those guys as,

447
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:54,430
um,
as sincere reformers or are they all 

448
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:54,940
charlatans work in a political angle?

449
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,870
Um,
well,

450
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:57,890
or are none of them?
No,

451
00:21:57,891 --> 00:21:58,370
I had no,
I,

452
00:21:58,371 --> 00:22:00,130
I have an answer to this because now 
I've,

453
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,810
now I've gone through it and this is,
as you point out,

454
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:07,811
this is one of the great debates in 
Roman history generally,

455
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:10,610
and also just like world history in 
general is,

456
00:22:10,611 --> 00:22:12,860
you know,
are these various popular reformers,

457
00:22:12,861 --> 00:22:17,861
are they merely cynical demagogues or 
are they genuinely interested in 

458
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:19,250
reforming the state?
Um,

459
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,670
and certainly even while they were still
alive,

460
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,470
their,
their um,

461
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,000
their allies were saying,
oh,

462
00:22:26,001 --> 00:22:26,570
they're,
you know,

463
00:22:26,571 --> 00:22:31,571
they're driven by lofty ideals and a,
and a genuine regard for the people and 

464
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:33,620
their enemies are producing pamphlet to 
the say,

465
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:34,460
oh no,
they're,

466
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:36,680
they're trying to make themselves the 
new kings of Rome.

467
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,970
So we're,
I,

468
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:44,080
I do come down on it about the Grok.
I in particular that I think that they 

469
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,380
were interested in genuine reform.

470
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,820
There was no like,
altruism at work here.

471
00:22:49,821 --> 00:22:50,900
I mean,
we're talking about like,

472
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:56,170
hi Roman politics.
There's not a lot of altruism going 

473
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,970
around out there,
but I think that they saw simultaneously

474
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,470
that a path to personal power,
which is what they were after,

475
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,420
they were incredibly ambitious,
uh,

476
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:10,570
could simultaneously solve a lot of the 
problems that Rome was now dealing with 

477
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,470
as it transitioned from being merely an 
Italian city state.

478
00:23:13,471 --> 00:23:16,460
One,
one among many to like the rulers of the

479
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:19,010
entire Mediterranean world.
Um,

480
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,840
but they existed on a spectrum where the
same,

481
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,950
you know,
the same meal,

482
00:23:24,951 --> 00:23:29,780
you have popolare energy coming out of 
the rural peasants or the urban plebs,

483
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,080
uh,
even the lower equestrian classes that 

484
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,080
have a lot of wealth but don't have a 
lot of,

485
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,320
um,
input politically,

486
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:41,770
uh,
those can be harnessed by people like 

487
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:44,261
the Grok I.
and they can also be harnessed by 

488
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:44,261
cynical demagogues who,
yes,

489
00:23:44,261 --> 00:23:46,400
are just there to say,
you're angry.

490
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,280
I know that you're angry.
I'm going to help you channel that anger

491
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,640
and I'm going to tell you who's to blame
for all of your problems.

492
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:57,641
And,
and then I'm going to point you at the 

493
00:23:57,641 --> 00:23:57,641
people who I'm telling you are to blame 
for it.

494
00:23:57,641 --> 00:23:57,641
And a,
Oh,

495
00:23:57,641 --> 00:24:02,531
wouldn't you know it,
the people who are to blame for it are 

496
00:24:02,531 --> 00:24:03,980
my personal enemies,
so you can use that same sort of,

497
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,040
it becomes a,
it becomes quite a revolutionary energy.

498
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,250
Um,
you can start to use that and manipulate

499
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:15,251
it.
So I think it's never fair to say that 

500
00:24:15,251 --> 00:24:17,060
all of them are sincere reformers and,
or all of them are cynical demagogues.

501
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:22,061
It's,
it's quite a mix of the two and people 

502
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:22,220
are going to land on a spectrum and 
people say,

503
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,400
you know,
people bring up the Kennedy Brothers for

504
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:30,401
the Rock Guy,
which doesn't really hold a lot of 

505
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:30,401
water.
Um,

506
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:32,120
but if there is anybody in American 
history who does look like the Rock,

507
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:34,290
I think it's the roosevelts,
um,

508
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,480
where,
what theater Roosevelt and Franklin 

509
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,970
Roosevelt and that the progressive 
reforms that they were making,

510
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,240
both of them were incredibly ambitious.
Both of them wanted to be president.

511
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:46,310
Both of them kind of wanted to be 
president forever.

512
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:46,960
Um,

513
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,890
and they were called traitors to their 
class.

514
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:49,570
Yeah.
And they were,

515
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,800
of course they were the.
Absolutely.

516
00:24:50,801 --> 00:24:53,320
And so they're very similar to the GROK 
I in that way that they were,

517
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,520
you know,
inner inner,

518
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,980
inner circle,
nobility and uh,

519
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:02,250
they're using all of their power and 
wealth and influence to really disrupt 

520
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,481
what the elites have going for them.
So I think if anybody is out there in 

521
00:25:06,481 --> 00:25:07,780
American history that does look like the
guy,

522
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,710
it's probably the Roosevelt.

523
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,880
Well,
I'm enjoying the analogy comparison too 

524
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:13,880
much to stop now.
So maybe you can give me,

525
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,350
have you ever thought about some of 
these other figures in your book and 

526
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,170
thought about American examples?
I mean,

527
00:25:19,171 --> 00:25:22,110
I can look at like a huey long,
for example,

528
00:25:22,111 --> 00:25:24,990
and see someone that maybe would have 
fit back into the Roman things.

529
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,770
I remember.
Was it Manchester?

530
00:25:26,771 --> 00:25:29,070
Manchester's book on Macarthur and 
American Caesar.

531
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:30,420
I mean,
there's always comparisons.

532
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,320
Um,
you know,

533
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,690
when you look at the Solos in the 
maurices and Cato,

534
00:25:33,691 --> 00:25:36,630
the elder and all those folks,
do you have any analogies that you often

535
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,180
think of when you think of some of these
major figures?

536
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,080
Well,
not to,

537
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:44,290
you know,
not to rain on anybody's parade,

538
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:49,291
but once you get,
once you get onto that like granular 

539
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:49,291
level,
like,

540
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:49,300
like who is,
you know,

541
00:25:49,301 --> 00:25:50,920
who would this be?
Um,

542
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,400
it does start to get harder to pin 
people down.

543
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:57,790
Like was macarthur was Macarthur and 
American Caesar.

544
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:58,870
Uh,
I don't know,

545
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,420
but it seems like probably a good thing 
that truman fired him.

546
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,220
I think it's an insult to Caesar myself,
but I'm biased.

547
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,220
Yeah.
Okay.

548
00:26:07,221 --> 00:26:08,000
Yeah,
I would say so.

549
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:08,930
I mean like,
yeah,

550
00:26:08,931 --> 00:26:13,931
I have of all the people that I've ever 
gone through that you can compare to 

551
00:26:13,931 --> 00:26:14,630
Julius Caesar.
I mean like it's Napoleon.

552
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,100
That's exactly.
Yeah.

553
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:20,240
Nobody else really like measures up to 
that particular class of,

554
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,210
you know,
having the totality of like I'm,

555
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:28,040
I can be genocidal and also like reform 
the metric system and I'm a genius.

556
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:33,041
Yes.
So if I successfully dodged the 

557
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:33,041
question.

558
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:33,390
Yes,
I think so.

559
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:34,490
I think so.
Well done.

560
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,690
Um,
so,

561
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:40,780
so okay.
So then let's talk then a little bit 

562
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,110
about the dynamics here because you 
know,

563
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:44,250
it's funny because when look at the 
Roman system,

564
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:47,130
it seems to be the wonderful,
unless you want to go to the Greeks,

565
00:26:47,131 --> 00:26:52,131
but it's the wonderful example of,
of the class divisions and then the 

566
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:55,980
problems inherent with,
with class warfare and sharing of power.

567
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:01,310
I mean if you want it to describe,
I mean we're talking about the iceberg 

568
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,371
that sinks the titanic here and we can 
talk about rules shifting and warlords 

569
00:27:04,371 --> 00:27:05,310
and everything,
but,

570
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:10,340
but what was it that shifted in terms of
a public being willing to accept 

571
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,830
senatorial control by a,
as you pointed out in the book,

572
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:17,380
a really small number of people in a 
fundamental sense and,

573
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,750
and,
and be able to push.

574
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:19,250
I mean the,
the,

575
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:24,450
the tribune of the plebs was one 
systemic tool that was introduced to 

576
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:29,421
help balance out those powers.
Could you say that that whole era 

577
00:27:29,421 --> 00:27:33,201
between Tiberius Caracas and maybe 
Caesar is an example of class warfare 

578
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:35,070
sort of playing out.
I mean,

579
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:40,071
how much of a role would you give to 
that ambitious men versus class warfare 

580
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,940
versus cycles and trends?
It's

581
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,940
really difficult to get into because 
Roman politics did operate differently 

582
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:54,130
than modern western politics.
Like the client system.

583
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

584
00:27:55,181 --> 00:27:57,520
So the,
the first and most important thing is to

585
00:27:57,521 --> 00:28:02,200
say that these are,
these are more like clan rivalries than,

586
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,570
um,
than class warfare where,

587
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,240
you know,
you're a,

588
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:10,430
you're a patron,
you're a leader and you have this 

589
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:10,430
network of clients who are all attached 
to you.

590
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,810
And then your political rivals have that
same network of,

591
00:28:13,811 --> 00:28:18,811
um,
of clients who were all attached to 

592
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:18,811
them.
So this is really like,

593
00:28:18,811 --> 00:28:20,290
this is really clans running into each 
other with,

594
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,320
with almost like nobles and retainers.
If you wanted to use like a medieval 

595
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,680
analogy rather than,
rather than like,

596
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,250
oh,
we're,

597
00:28:27,251 --> 00:28:32,251
you know,
we're the lower classes and we are 

598
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:32,320
trying to overthrow you guys the upper 
classes.

599
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,050
But that said,
um,

600
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,770
during this era,
right after,

601
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,800
after 1:46,
I think you do have a new class style of

602
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,000
politics that one of these rival clans 
can take advantage of.

603
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Right?
And so hopefully I'm able to paint this 

604
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,190
correctly.
So what it is,

605
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:59,191
is you have this ability to go out into 
just the voting public,

606
00:28:59,411 --> 00:29:01,240
right?
Because all of these people could vote,

607
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,680
um,
the rural peasants,

608
00:29:02,681 --> 00:29:07,681
the urban pubs,
they could all vote and you could use 

609
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:10,171
the popular assemblies to pass 
legislation to make yourself and your 

610
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:10,600
own clan very,
very popular.

611
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:15,601
So this is almost something that like 
you would be sitting around with your 

612
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:15,601
senatorial family.
You're,

613
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:17,590
you're an ambitious senatorial family,
and you're like,

614
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:19,700
how are we going to get power,
um,

615
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:25,060
of that appeal to the populace is an 
available method of doing it.

616
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:30,570
So you're ginning up class interests and
you're pointing them at often.

617
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,790
Usually you're pointing it at the 
corrupt Senate and saying like,

618
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:34,480
we're gonna,
you know,

619
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:38,590
we are going to deliver to you what the 
corrupt Senate has been denying you.

620
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:44,490
But five years later or 10 years later,
maybe your rival has decided to,

621
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,040
to try to adopt one of these popular 
platforms and use that.

622
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:53,041
Well now you suddenly become the 
defender of old senatorial interests 

623
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:57,450
because your rival was the one who is 
now doing the popular program and so it 

624
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:01,501
was,
it was a lot of like taking on and 

625
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:01,501
putting off of hats where you were 
temporary,

626
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:05,770
you might temporarily be the leader of a
popular movement and then 10 years later

627
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:08,320
you might be standing in lock step with 
the Senate.

628
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,770
So it was very,
it was,

629
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:12,750
it was a lot more fluid I think than,
um,

630
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,650
than anything that would be going on,
say,

631
00:30:14,651 --> 00:30:15,880
like,
you know,

632
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,320
with,
with battles between unions,

633
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:22,321
battles between like socialist and 
capitalists in the modern era where 

634
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,450
there's really class interests involved.
And you really had also like lower class

635
00:30:25,451 --> 00:30:30,451
leaders doing the leading in that sense,
which you don't really get that in Roman

636
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:31,270
history.

637
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,030
No.
And it was interesting because,

638
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,550
uh,
you had included in the book something,

639
00:30:35,551 --> 00:30:37,410
I think it was cato,
the elder had talked about,

640
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,880
and we're getting back here to,
to the changes in Rome because of the 

641
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,131
punic wars on the various conquest about
the amount of wealth that was being 

642
00:30:46,131 --> 00:30:47,610
dragged back to Rome by some of these 
people,

643
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,320
you know,
because most of the people don't benefit

644
00:30:49,321 --> 00:30:51,480
from these conquests,
but some of these commanders and whatnot

645
00:30:51,481 --> 00:30:53,940
would come back.
You were talking about 40,000

646
00:30:53,941 --> 00:30:57,750
pounds of silver and things like that.
Talk a little about how,

647
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:02,900
and this is,
this is such a Roman moralizer point of 

648
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:02,900
view,
right?

649
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,810
About how the nouveau riche Romans or 
forgetting their values,

650
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,570
but you included it in the book.
How much did the,

651
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:10,770
did the Roman system change?
Because all of a sudden it went from a,

652
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,570
well,
at least the,

653
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,400
the portrayals of it make it sound like 
more spartan,

654
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,440
more old values to cato,
the elder looking at the nice figs and 

655
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,190
saying,
Carthage must be destroyed.

656
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,390
I,
I think that the role of this new wealth

657
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:30,391
there,
there's a couple of things that all of 

658
00:31:30,391 --> 00:31:30,391
this new wealth does,
um,

659
00:31:30,391 --> 00:31:31,060
does bring into play,
right?

660
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,760
Like the Cato,
the elder style critique,

661
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:38,290
which is that all of this wealth 
degraded the morality of the upper class

662
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:43,291
or degraded the morality of the Romans,
I think is less important.

663
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,830
I don't think that that is,
is a huge driver of,

664
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,420
of,
of what the problem was.

665
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:51,880
I don't think it was that the wealth 
degraded their morals.

666
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,440
How do you think it was that it created 
a skyrocketing economic inequality,

667
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:03,150
right?
Where there had always been rich and 

668
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:03,150
poor in Rome,
right?

669
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:03,150
That,
that is going to be true.

670
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:06,270
Going all the way back.
What was happening is that as,

671
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,560
as you just mentioned,
and I read about this in the book,

672
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:11,020
that you have these legions going out 
there going out to Greece,

673
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:16,040
Macedonia,
they're going to north Africa and 

674
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,040
they're bringing back 300,000
gold coins.

675
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,120
They're bringing back 80,000
pounds of raw silver.

676
00:32:19,121 --> 00:32:24,121
I mean,
literally like the Specie of the 

677
00:32:24,121 --> 00:32:27,271
available specie of the Mediterranean is
being thrown into Roman wagons and 

678
00:32:27,271 --> 00:32:32,161
hauled back to Rome,
all of which is being controlled mostly 

679
00:32:32,161 --> 00:32:35,640
by that upper class senatorial elite or 
the,

680
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,660
you know,
the richer equestrian classes,

681
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:40,520
right?
The sort of the subset of the people who

682
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:45,521
are one step below the senators.
These guys are the ones who are 

683
00:32:45,521 --> 00:32:49,031
controlling all of this wealth.
And I do think that far from degrading 

684
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:53,501
the morality of the thing,
it does degrade the socioeconomic 

685
00:32:53,501 --> 00:32:53,660
system.
Where,

686
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:55,010
what are they going to do with all this 
gold?

687
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,020
Uh,
the Romans did not.

688
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:01,700
They did not sit around counting,
counting their gold pieces like scrooge,

689
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,400
uh,
in,

690
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:02,900
you know,
in,

691
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
in a Christmas carol.
They want to invest their gold into 

692
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,500
things and most especially they want to 
invest it in land.

693
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,700
So their,
their ability to now command this huge,

694
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:18,730
huge amount of wealth they're pouring it
into trying to buy up as much land as 

695
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:23,141
they possibly can.
And this does lead to the further 

696
00:33:23,141 --> 00:33:24,170
dispossession of all of those poor Roman
farmers,

697
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,480
uh,
that we talked about a couple of minutes

698
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,480
ago,
so that there's that process that is an 

699
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,640
unfolding,
that wealth being controlled by a few 

700
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,071
rich families is leading those rich 
families to expand their own land 

701
00:33:36,071 --> 00:33:39,200
holdings across Italy.
And that's just gonna disrupt the entire

702
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:44,201
socioeconomic system at that had been in
existence for hundreds of years.

703
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:48,440
And that's just the one thing that 
they're investing all their money in.

704
00:33:48,441 --> 00:33:53,441
And the other thing that they're 
investing all of their money in his 

705
00:33:53,441 --> 00:33:55,751
slaves so they're now able to,
the richer Romans are now able to bring 

706
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:59,150
slaves into the system on,
again,

707
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:00,870
an unprecedented scale.
Uh,

708
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,930
the Romans had always had slaves.

709
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:08,020
Slaves had always been around.
But now you really have the slaves 

710
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,500
beginning to do most of the,
at least commercial labor of this,

711
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,280
of Roman society.
They're out there.

712
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:16,240
They're picking the,
they're doing work in the fields.

713
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:16,950
They're,
you know,

714
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,800
they're doing the olives.
They are,

715
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:20,060
if they're skilled,
right?

716
00:34:20,061 --> 00:34:21,590
If you,
if you get captured and you're like,

717
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:22,070
Hey,
I can,

718
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:23,740
you know,
make tables,

719
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:29,550
then you're going to be put to work 
making tables for your owner or if 

720
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,390
you're really unlucky you're going to be
sent off to work in one of the mines and

721
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:37,391
that's again,
that's just going to be producing more 

722
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:37,700
and more wealth for the senatorial 
aristocracy.

723
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:40,880
So that combination of,
of massive amounts of wealth,

724
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:45,910
massive amounts of slaves,
but always really to the benefit of a 

725
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:49,190
very small elite inside of Rome creates,
I think the,

726
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:54,340
the fundamentally destabilizing energy 
that is going to allow some of these,

727
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:58,910
of a genuine reformers all the way to 
cynical demagogues or all the way,

728
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:03,970
you know,
ultimately culminating with Julius 

729
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:03,970
Caesar who is the pop laray,
you know,

730
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:08,300
a reformer slash super ambitious noble 
par excellence.

731
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:10,220
It's all going to culminate with him.
And

732
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:15,220
the slaves to me is the ultimate 
different variable when they do the 

733
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,490
comparisons between say the US now in 
the Roman republic.

734
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:18,260
Because even if you wanted to argue 
about,

735
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:23,700
you know,
slave labor being equivalent to low 

736
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:23,700
income labor from over the border or 
whatever.

737
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,800
I don't,
I don't see the similarity,

738
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,470
uh,
and it would be if you wanted to make an

739
00:35:27,471 --> 00:35:30,220
analogy with what the Romans did or what
a lot of people's did in,

740
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:32,630
in earlier history,
it would be like we went into the Middle

741
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:37,630
East,
toppled Saddam Hussein and brought 

742
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:37,630
thousands of Iraqis back to the United 
States to serve us.

743
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:42,350
Um,
sounds like an inherently unstable 

744
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,631
situation to begin with.
I found it interesting when you were 

745
00:35:44,631 --> 00:35:44,631
talking about,
um,

746
00:35:44,631 --> 00:35:49,130
who had power in Rome and you talked 
about assemblies and that the average 

747
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:53,031
Joe on the street had more,
I would say both more and less power 

748
00:35:53,031 --> 00:35:56,901
maybe then one thought,
but you're lying about being able to 

749
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:56,901
control.

750
00:35:56,901 --> 00:36:00,530
Maybe you would.
I think in England they called it king 

751
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:00,530
mob at one point.
The,

752
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:03,510
the ability to control the political 
heart of Rome as,

753
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,830
as the population,
uh,

754
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:08,370
gave a certain amount of power in the 
city.

755
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:13,510
It always amazed me that,
that in that kind of a situation that 

756
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:13,740
you never had a French revolution kind 
of thing when,

757
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:18,950
when it's so much a large percentage of 
the population being balanced out by 

758
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:22,881
such a small class,
but it's that client relationship that 

759
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:23,760
sort of weaves the threads of 
connections,

760
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:26,310
isn't it through the rich,
the poor and the middle classes.

761
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,460
And could you talk a minute about the 
equestrian class maybe and a connection 

762
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:33,590
to what today we would call,
you know,

763
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,220
corporations and,
and,

764
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,650
and the fact that because the Roman 
senators,

765
00:36:37,651 --> 00:36:39,780
we're not supposed to involve themselves
in business.

766
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:44,990
It's sort of left a loophole for these 
other people to come in and create what 

767
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:45,660
I think today we would call 
corporations.

768
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,710
You think that's a fair term?

769
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,190
Yeah,
I think that they were corporations.

770
00:36:49,191 --> 00:36:49,740
Uh,
they were,

771
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,800
they were stock.
You would actually buy stock in these 

772
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:54,800
things.
Okay.

773
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:54,800
So that's fair.
All right.

774
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:54,800
Yeah.
And in a,

775
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,970
in a rudimentary way that.
Yeah,

776
00:36:56,971 --> 00:37:01,971
so there was,
there was this prohibition on the 

777
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:05,661
senators,
like somebody who was in the Senate and 

778
00:37:05,661 --> 00:37:05,661
you're talking about,
you know,

779
00:37:05,661 --> 00:37:08,930
maybe 300,
350 men and their families are 

780
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,040
prohibited from conducting commercial 
transactions.

781
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:13,860
And of course,
just the caveat to this is it,

782
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:15,810
all of them did it.
They all had,

783
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,290
they all had front,
they all had clients that they would use

784
00:37:19,291 --> 00:37:19,860
were like,
oh,

785
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:21,480
this is my guy,
you know,

786
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,920
a Publius,
uh,

787
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,770
he just,
he's somebody who just so happens to own

788
00:37:25,771 --> 00:37:28,050
a large amount of commercial real 
estate.

789
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:29,610
And I just happened to know him and it's
like,

790
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,060
it was all a front.
Um,

791
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,470
so most senators were able to dodge this
quite easily,

792
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:39,890
but the Roman state itself didn't 
perform any of their own logistical 

793
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,250
enterprises.

794
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,030
Right.
Like even,

795
00:37:45,031 --> 00:37:47,400
right down to right down to tax 
collection.

796
00:37:47,401 --> 00:37:52,401
Right.
The Romans did not have state employees 

797
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:55,491
who were tax collectors.
They didn't have state employees who 

798
00:37:55,491 --> 00:37:57,390
made uniforms for the legions and ship 
them off to the legions.

799
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,720
Um,
this was all done by groups of wealthy 

800
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,670
individuals who were not in the Senate,
uh,

801
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:07,320
because we wanted to be able to get 
around that,

802
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,460
you know,
the commercial,

803
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,600
the commercial prohibitions.
So you have these very wealthy families 

804
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,960
in Rome who are not a part of the Senate
who are actually the ones who were now 

805
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,071
handling the wealth of the society,
the large scale transactions.

806
00:38:22,681 --> 00:38:27,681
They're there.
What they would do is they would come 

807
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:27,681
together,
say that the tax collectors,

808
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:31,650
if you,
if you want one of these tax farming 

809
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:31,650
contracts and you would say,
okay,

810
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:35,070
here's how much we're going to bid to 
get this contract.

811
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,620
And then the sensor,
once every five years would award,

812
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,380
would award a contract.
And let's say your company won the bid,

813
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:46,740
then you would now have the right to go 
to some province or go to some area and 

814
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,551
be in charge of the tax collection where
any amount of money that you,

815
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:56,430
that you made out collecting taxes above
what you had bid was going to be your 

816
00:38:56,741 --> 00:38:58,020
profit.
Um,

817
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,840
that model of extracting taxes from 
provincials left itself open to like 

818
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:09,140
wild corruption and abuse,
where if,

819
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:13,270
if your profit margin is simply however 
much you can get out of these people,

820
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,650
um,
it,

821
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,810
it's going to lead you to strong arm 
people.

822
00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:20,620
It's going to lead you to demand more 
than they actually owed in taxes.

823
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,570
And the Roman government,
the Roman provincial administrations,

824
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:30,571
I mean the people who would actually be 
out there and near Spain or in further 

825
00:39:30,571 --> 00:39:32,530
Spain actually representing the Roman 
government as,

826
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,820
as like a state agent.

827
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,580
I mean you're talking about less than 
100 people.

828
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:39,850
You're talking about the governor,
his family,

829
00:39:39,851 --> 00:39:41,770
and maybe a couple other elected 
officials.

830
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,900
Meanwhile,
the face of Rome,

831
00:39:43,901 --> 00:39:47,510
how they're the people who were actually
running the province is,

832
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,560
is these,
uh,

833
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,460
are these tax farmers with very little 
oversight.

834
00:39:51,461 --> 00:39:54,010
And you could kind of like if you were a
tax form or you could go to a family and

835
00:39:54,011 --> 00:39:54,490
say like,
Hey,

836
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:57,340
you owe me this and taxes.
The provincial pays the tax.

837
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,340
Then you come back around six months 
later and say,

838
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:01,660
Hey,
you want me this tax again?

839
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:02,950
And the family could say,
hey,

840
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:06,010
we already paid that tax six months ago 
and the tax farmer would just say,

841
00:40:06,011 --> 00:40:08,110
why I don't care.
You pay me a.

842
00:40:08,111 --> 00:40:10,510
and there's no,
there's no oversight to any of this,

843
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,670
uh,
no real effective oversight anyway.

844
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,970
And this creates the same kind of,
um,

845
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:20,380
really anger and resentment at a look at
what the Roman administrators,

846
00:40:20,381 --> 00:40:23,530
we're up to a,
amongst the provincials out out there in

847
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:25,310
Spain or in Greece or later,
uh,

848
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,970
in Asia or what is today,
western Turkey.

849
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:33,450
Um,
that in and of itself lead to a 

850
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,270
destabilization of their imperial hold 
on things.

851
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:39,271
And that doesn't all get straightened 
out really until augustus comes along 

852
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:41,020
and starts introducing a more stable 
reforms.

853
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:43,840
So fleeced by the contractors,
right?

854
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,790
Very much so.
Very much so.

855
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:47,360
So let me,
let me ask you,

856
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:52,690
and this is,
there's a little bit of storytelling 

857
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:52,690
here because I think it's horrifying to 
me.

858
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:56,660
The first time I ever read anything in 
ancient history that reminded me of like

859
00:40:56,661 --> 00:41:00,010
George Orwell's 19,
84 a.

860
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,600
and maybe this is just the way my,
my brain connects things.

861
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:04,330
But when you read about,
you know,

862
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:06,800
the,
the Marius and the seller arrows,

863
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:09,680
when,
when prescription lists are going up and

864
00:41:09,681 --> 00:41:13,310
people will read about whether or not 
they're being sentenced to die,

865
00:41:13,311 --> 00:41:18,311
I mean,
that has such a third rice kind of 

866
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:22,331
Orwellian may be feel to,
it can go into that a little bit and 

867
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:22,331
talk about,
um,

868
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:27,310
talk about how different that was for 
Rome to wake up and go see if you were 

869
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:28,340
on the list to die.
So

870
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,960
at the beginning of the book,
right,

871
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:36,020
we're at the,
there's between various political 

872
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,100
rivals,
various political groups,

873
00:41:37,101 --> 00:41:42,101
various families,
and they start maneuvering around each 

874
00:41:42,101 --> 00:41:44,020
other and they start breaking down these
rules of most of them.

875
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,710
But,
but kind of in the early days,

876
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,020
it's all very ad hoc.
It's all very spontaneous,

877
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:53,370
uh,
and it's really more about like 

878
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,410
maneuvering in new ways that hadn't been
done before.

879
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,690
You start plotting along through the 
book.

880
00:41:56,691 --> 00:41:57,860
Yeah,
you get to chapter eight,

881
00:41:57,861 --> 00:42:02,861
you get to chapter nine.
Now we're talking about these groups 

882
00:42:02,861 --> 00:42:04,460
having a armed,
like on retainer,

883
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,070
armed gangs who are going to fight for 
you.

884
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:12,640
And by the very end of the book,
it becomes necessary to not just defeat 

885
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,560
your rivals and have them say like,
oh,

886
00:42:15,561 --> 00:42:16,070
okay,
well,

887
00:42:16,071 --> 00:42:18,080
I lost that vote,
or I lost that console ship.

888
00:42:18,081 --> 00:42:20,150
I guess I'll go home now.
Um,

889
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:25,740
you're,
you're operating in a civil war 

890
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,350
environment where it's no longer enough 
to just beat your rivals.

891
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,310
You have to kill,
you have to kill them.

892
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:33,490
And if you don't kill them,
then they're going to come back and 

893
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:33,490
they're going to kill you.
So there's,

894
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:38,470
there's a,
there's a little tight cycle of this 

895
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:38,470
where,
you know,

896
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:42,330
when.
I don't want to do too much in the way 

897
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:42,330
of spoilers if you haven't read the 
book.

898
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:42,330
But yeah,
I mean,

899
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:45,821
we,
we kind of all know it all ends badly 

900
00:42:45,821 --> 00:42:45,821
for the Romans.
So it's not too much of a spoiler to say

901
00:42:45,821 --> 00:42:47,230
it ends badly for most of these people.
Um,

902
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,720
but the seller goes off to the east,
uh,

903
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,430
to fight his battle,
to fight his war against Mithra Daddy's.

904
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:59,120
He's had this very intense struggle with
Maurice and Maurice,

905
00:42:59,121 --> 00:43:03,270
his allies and Maurice and his allies 
wind up coming into Rome.

906
00:43:03,271 --> 00:43:08,271
And recapturing Rome having been booted 
out a couple of weeks earlier and they 

907
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:10,520
start killing the allies of Sela.

908
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:16,300
This leads when seller comes back a 
couple years later for solid to 

909
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:20,100
reciprocate to give as good as it gets.
And starting.

910
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,610
You get literally putting up named 
lists,

911
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,810
right?
Here's a list of names.

912
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:26,180
And if you kill one of these people and 
bring me their head,

913
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,640
then I will pay you.
I will pay you money.

914
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:33,510
And what is kind of.
And it also not just Orwellian,

915
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,480
but also like very Kafka ask,
right?

916
00:43:35,481 --> 00:43:37,490
Where it's all.
It all becomes very arbitrary.

917
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,890
Um,
where the whole,

918
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,640
the whole original point of the 
prescription list was so that the people

919
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:45,710
who sell low was not planning on 
killing.

920
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:47,270
Could rest easy.
Like,

921
00:43:47,271 --> 00:43:47,630
oh,
okay,

922
00:43:47,631 --> 00:43:50,690
well my name's not on the list,
so I'll be fine.

923
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:54,320
But every day a new list goes up with 
new names on it.

924
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,740
And you start having names being added 
to the list.

925
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,400
Not because they are enemies of Sela but
because they happen to be enemies of 

926
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,590
maybe one of cellos our allies or in the
case of crisis.

927
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:08,900
And uh,
he is like,

928
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:14,140
hey,
you own a very rich estate down here in 

929
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,901
Campania,
I think I would actually like to own 

930
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:16,901
that estate,
so I think I'm going to declare you an,

931
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:18,950
an and an enemy of Sela and have you 
killed.

932
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,180
So those prescriptions that sort of eat 
up the last,

933
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:27,181
uh,
the last few chapters of the book are 

934
00:44:27,181 --> 00:44:29,591
all very bloody and they become,
it takes on an absurd level where it 

935
00:44:30,321 --> 00:44:32,820
doesn't even matter whether you're an 
enemy of somebody.

936
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:37,821
And there's a quote from some,
from some rich equestrian who gets 

937
00:44:37,821 --> 00:44:38,420
killed in east,
he says,

938
00:44:38,421 --> 00:44:41,370
ah,
done for because of my Alban farm.

939
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,480
And then yeah,
he gets,

940
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:44,430
he gets killed in his farm,
gets confiscated.

941
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:49,431
So it moves very quickly from I have to 
kill my enemies in order to triumph,

942
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,780
to just like,
let's just kill everybody and confiscate

943
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:52,320
their stuff.

944
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:57,680
And it's a wanted dead or alive kind of 
approach to getting the enemy's isn't it

945
00:44:57,681 --> 00:44:58,600
sort of like,
uh,

946
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,710
uh,
bring us back the head and we'll pay,

947
00:45:00,711 --> 00:45:05,711
I mean,
a little bit different than sending out 

948
00:45:05,711 --> 00:45:05,711
your own Gestapo.

949
00:45:05,711 --> 00:45:07,480
Exactly.
And so you actually started having,

950
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:10,760
it became a fairly lucrative profession 
for,

951
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,800
for a couple months and even then for a 
couple years where you would go out and 

952
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:15,800
you would be like,
Hey,

953
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,310
well let's,
we'll,

954
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:18,250
we'll almost like bounty hunters.
Right?

955
00:45:18,251 --> 00:45:19,450
We'll go through.
Just going to say that.

956
00:45:19,451 --> 00:45:20,710
Exactly.
Yeah.

957
00:45:20,711 --> 00:45:22,930
And we'll kill them in and then we'll 
get their stuff.

958
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,070
And what is,
you know,

959
00:45:24,071 --> 00:45:29,071
and I also do mention this in the book,
is there does come a point where they 

960
00:45:29,071 --> 00:45:29,740
start to realize that,
I mean,

961
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,660
they don't realize the way that we do 
that there's,

962
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:34,840
there are no photographs of anybody,
there are no pictures of anybody.

963
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,440
They don't live in a digital age where 
you have a seller can hold up a picture 

964
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,020
and then hold up the head and be like,
oh yeah,

965
00:45:41,021 --> 00:45:46,021
you got the right guy.
And you start having them just grab 

966
00:45:46,021 --> 00:45:46,021
random dude off the street,
kill them,

967
00:45:46,021 --> 00:45:47,380
chop their head off,
take it in and say,

968
00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:48,550
oh,
this is a.

969
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,080
and then they're like,
kind of scanning the list.

970
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:50,980
Oh,
this is this guy.

971
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:51,850
It's guys.
Yeah,

972
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:52,420
berries.
Yeah,

973
00:45:52,421 --> 00:45:52,840
he's,
yeah,

974
00:45:52,841 --> 00:45:53,950
definitely.
This is his head,

975
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:55,600
and then you would get your bounty.

976
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:58,980
Yeah.
It's a little like this black scout that

977
00:45:58,981 --> 00:46:01,200
I'm giving you a black hair.
This is an Apache scalp.

978
00:46:01,201 --> 00:46:02,260
I guarantee it,
you know,

979
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,460
250 gold.
It's all,

980
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,270
it's all very twisted.
It's all,

981
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,270
it's all very.
It's all quite statistic to be honest.

982
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:14,510
Something that comes to my mind and I 
honestly don't know the answer and the 

983
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:14,700
period we're talking about here,
but,

984
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:19,730
but discussing the,
the attempts by what we would call 

985
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:23,841
today,
foreign powers are foreign entities to 

986
00:46:23,841 --> 00:46:25,380
influence the politics of a vibrant,
let's call it,

987
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:28,210
on the way to corrupt republic.
Uh,

988
00:46:28,211 --> 00:46:33,211
I just finished a show we did on 
Caesar's conquest of Gol and it's 

989
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:33,510
interesting how the more,
um,

990
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,960
shall we call them civilized or more 
romanesque.

991
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:40,970
Golic tribes were basically trying to 
influence the politics in Rome during 

992
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:45,381
the period you're talking about.
Are there outside forces from other 

993
00:46:45,381 --> 00:46:48,801
states trying to push their agenda or 
point of view or the direction they'd 

994
00:46:48,801 --> 00:46:51,040
like to see Rome a move towards?
Um,

995
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,830
were,
were any of the outside entities in,

996
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,840
in the geopolitical world of the 
Mediterranean at that time trying to 

997
00:46:58,840 --> 00:46:58,920
influence Roman politics?

998
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:05,360
Definitely.
And this had been true for quite some 

999
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:05,360
time where,
you know,

1000
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,040
going back even before the beginning of 
the book,

1001
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,910
after Rome defeats Hannibal in the 
second punic war,

1002
00:47:11,911 --> 00:47:16,911
there was a,
there was a good like 50 or 60 year 

1003
00:47:16,911 --> 00:47:18,180
period where Rome was the most powerful 
state in the Mediterranean,

1004
00:47:18,181 --> 00:47:23,181
but not quite.
I hadn't quite decided they wanted to 

1005
00:47:23,181 --> 00:47:25,911
annex and rule the Mediterranean 
directly where they almost set 

1006
00:47:25,911 --> 00:47:29,601
themselves up as kind of an arbitrator 
of last resort for various city and 

1007
00:47:29,601 --> 00:47:31,780
kingdoms out there.
So you would have like a couple of Greek

1008
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:36,990
cities who were in having some border 
dispute or having some like fishing 

1009
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:40,531
rights dispute and they would agree to 
take their case to Rome and anytime 

1010
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:41,380
these.
So,

1011
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:46,390
so Rome became like a hub of 
international embassies and ambassadors 

1012
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:50,521
and people constantly envoys coming and 
going from really as far away as Syria 

1013
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:55,351
and Egypt and all of them are bringing 
with them gifts that could only be 

1014
00:47:56,111 --> 00:47:57,190
described as bribes.

1015
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:02,490
Where you are definitely going to try to
get what you want from the Senate by 

1016
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:06,910
making sure that the right senators have
received the right gifts and that that's

1017
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:09,010
something that had really,
this was again,

1018
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:14,011
something that had opened up and,
and does get to a more corrupt version 

1019
00:48:14,011 --> 00:48:17,410
of the senate than had existed before.
In the context of,

1020
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:22,770
of my book,
the great example of this in my book is 

1021
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:26,760
[inaudible] conduct in new media where 
he is one of the kings of new media 

1022
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:28,170
after,
uh,

1023
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:33,240
after his,
I guess adopted father dies along with 

1024
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,061
his two brothers,
but [inaudible] would prefer to be the 

1025
00:48:36,061 --> 00:48:37,120
sole king of new media.
And so he starts breaking treaties.

1026
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:42,420
P starts killing his brothers and he 
wants the Senate to just go along with 

1027
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:47,401
what he's doing down there rather than 
sending in legions or trying to stop 

1028
00:48:47,401 --> 00:48:50,911
him.
So he absolutely quite brazenly and 

1029
00:48:50,911 --> 00:48:52,240
quite nakedly is and voice to the Roman 
Senate,

1030
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:57,270
laden with gold and laden with gifts and
trying to influence the Senate's 

1031
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:58,270
conduct.

1032
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,060
And he's quite successful at it.
Uh,

1033
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:05,100
for most of the first seven or eight 
years of [inaudible] reign,

1034
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,660
he's definitely able to have more or 
less paid friends in the Senate,

1035
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:15,840
direct the senate away from the notion 
of ever sending the legions in to 

1036
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,580
confront Jakartha and,
and it,

1037
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:19,060
it gets quite bad where you do have 
these senators.

1038
00:49:19,061 --> 00:49:19,870
So like,
my God,

1039
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:25,110
this is so brazen,
like where we might actually have to do 

1040
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:25,110
something about this,
like you're making us all look bad,

1041
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:26,260
is there,
they're sort of chastising,

1042
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,130
uh,
their,

1043
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:30,040
their colleagues in the Senate who are 
accepting all of [inaudible] money.

1044
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,860
And that point,
um,

1045
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:36,820
the,
the corruption of the Senate by as money

1046
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:40,660
does become a flash point in Roman 
politics.

1047
00:49:40,661 --> 00:49:41,230
Where,
again,

1048
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:46,231
if you go back to some of these popular 
are energies that had been sort of 

1049
00:49:46,231 --> 00:49:47,680
started this had started fomenting that.

1050
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,630
They're saying like,
you know,

1051
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:53,920
Jakartha is brazenly flouting a Roman 
authority and Roman law.

1052
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:58,921
We're,
or we're telling him to do things and 

1053
00:49:58,921 --> 00:49:58,921
he's ignoring us.
He's killing Italians.

1054
00:49:58,921 --> 00:50:02,170
He's killing Roman citizens.
And yet we continue to do nothing.

1055
00:50:02,171 --> 00:50:05,680
Why is that?
And it's because Jakartha has bribed his

1056
00:50:05,681 --> 00:50:08,710
way into the Senate and so they actually
open up,

1057
00:50:08,711 --> 00:50:11,170
they're actually able to open up as sort
of like a quasi,

1058
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,870
uh,
like a special tribunal that is going to

1059
00:50:13,871 --> 00:50:18,871
start to investigate and prosecute those
in the Senate who were guilty of being 

1060
00:50:18,871 --> 00:50:23,701
corrupted by Jakartha,
which gets me to a question of tipping 

1061
00:50:23,701 --> 00:50:28,430
points and points of no return when you 
look at the,

1062
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,160
you know,
when,

1063
00:50:29,161 --> 00:50:34,161
when people like to look for examples 
from the past to try to analyze our own 

1064
00:50:34,161 --> 00:50:35,990
times and you do quite a bit of that in 
the book and I love it.

1065
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,800
But when you look at our situation now 
and the people who founded this country 

1066
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,480
and who wrote the documents,
uh,

1067
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:47,510
that form our framework,
we're keen students of the Roman 

1068
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,520
republic obviously.
And so they were paying attention to the

1069
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:52,580
flaws in their system and how things 
went wrong and try to make,

1070
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:57,910
uh,
make changes in their own version 

1071
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,801
obviously,
so that we wouldn't fall down the same 

1072
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:02,621
rat hole.
But when do you think it was 

1073
00:51:02,621 --> 00:51:02,621
irreversible?
In other words,

1074
00:51:02,621 --> 00:51:04,970
when do you think the death spiral had 
been reached?

1075
00:51:04,971 --> 00:51:07,150
Where you can imagine now,
uh,

1076
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:07,700
were,
were,

1077
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,510
were the,
the,

1078
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,520
the,
the points of entry and the,

1079
00:51:11,521 --> 00:51:14,450
the ability to compromise it,
just gone to farming.

1080
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:19,630
Is it when the violence first breaks out
or is it after that or is it before 

1081
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:19,630
that,
where do you,

1082
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:22,940
if you had to find a tipping point when 
the iceberg struck the titanic,

1083
00:51:22,941 --> 00:51:25,310
maybe it's a better way to put it.
Where is it in your mind?

1084
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:28,610
Well,
so I'll answer that in a sec.

1085
00:51:28,611 --> 00:51:30,370
I will say that,
um,

1086
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,480
you know,
one of the reasons we know so much about

1087
00:51:32,481 --> 00:51:37,481
everything I just said about Jakartha is
because the Roman historian Salus 

1088
00:51:37,481 --> 00:51:42,400
elected to write about the jigger war 
and Bertha's corruption of the Senate 

1089
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,141
and the battles that ensued a.
and Saul was to somebody who was 

1090
00:51:47,141 --> 00:51:47,160
writing.
He was,

1091
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:49,320
he was a partisan of Julius Caesar's.
Uh,

1092
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,090
so he's writing his books right around 
the forties and thirties BC.

1093
00:51:53,091 --> 00:51:58,091
So he,
he knows how it all turns out and he's 

1094
00:51:58,091 --> 00:51:58,091
writing,
you know,

1095
00:51:58,091 --> 00:51:59,060
fairly,
fairly contemporaneously with events.

1096
00:51:59,061 --> 00:52:04,061
And he wrote about the [inaudible] war 
specifically because he said that was 

1097
00:52:04,061 --> 00:52:04,470
the tipping point,
right?

1098
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,970
That was when he said that was the first
moment that laying on like the old,

1099
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:13,230
uh,
the corruption of the Senate was first 

1100
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,221
challenged.
And what led to what became these 

1101
00:52:15,221 --> 00:52:16,400
partisan battles that ultimately 
destroyed the senate.

1102
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,400
He,
he actually identified the jigger thien 

1103
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:21,400
war as,
as,

1104
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,130
as that tipping point,
which is why he wrote about it.

1105
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,950
Now,
could the senate had,

1106
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:25,700
or could,
could,

1107
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:29,090
could the Roman republic have pulled out
of it at that point?

1108
00:52:29,091 --> 00:52:34,091
Like,
I think so the point that I come to is,

1109
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,440
it's,
it's really,

1110
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:39,620
it's solace conduct,
uh,

1111
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,660
at the very end,
what,

1112
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:43,460
what becomes the end of the book,
but solids conduct,

1113
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:48,770
um,
during some of his final showdown is 

1114
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:51,461
really what sets the final permanent 
blueprint for how you can achieve power 

1115
00:52:53,961 --> 00:52:58,040
by completely disregarding just anything
but brute force.

1116
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,050
So Sala is going to,
he,

1117
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,880
he loses a political confrontation.
So Louisa,

1118
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:05,280
he,
he had command of this eastern army.

1119
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:11,700
He Marius uses the power of the assembly
to strip sela of his command and send 

1120
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:17,651
Sela away what Martez thinks he's sent,
so a packing for good and sell really is

1121
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:21,500
faced with this choice of,
do I accept this defeat?

1122
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:26,500
Do I get stripped of my command?
Do I accept the humiliation that I have 

1123
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,750
just endured at the hands of my rival 
Maurice?

1124
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:33,110
Or do I go back to my five legions who 
are loyal to me personally and do I 

1125
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:38,601
point them at Rome and March on Rome to 
a victorious from Rome and reclaim what 

1126
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:44,031
I think is rightfully mine.
Once one solid did that and then 

1127
00:53:45,061 --> 00:53:47,850
ultimately he emerges victorious from 
everything.

1128
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:54,410
That is the point that men like Julius 
Caesar and men like pompey a WHO's an 

1129
00:53:55,351 --> 00:53:59,970
early partisan of sellers are going to 
be looking at later on down the road and

1130
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:00,540
saying,
well,

1131
00:54:00,541 --> 00:54:01,520
if,
if nothing else,

1132
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,760
I can do that.
I mean,

1133
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:05,100
this is.
We don't have any,

1134
00:54:05,101 --> 00:54:08,220
I don't think like exact quotes or proof
in,

1135
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:09,120
in the,
in the,

1136
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,440
in the historical record that Julius 
Caesar was,

1137
00:54:11,441 --> 00:54:14,520
was actively thinking about seller when 
he crossed the Rubicon.

1138
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:20,060
But it had to have been on his mind and 
the proof was in the pudding for solace 

1139
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,660
conduct.
If you get a large army,

1140
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:26,900
keep them loyal to you,
you can use them to prosecute your own 

1141
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,991
domestic political enemies and emerge 
victorious and become a dictator for 

1142
00:54:29,991 --> 00:54:31,010
life.
So I,

1143
00:54:31,011 --> 00:54:33,900
I sort of put it there.
I think that Cellos,

1144
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,480
cellos decisions in those,
in those moments,

1145
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,610
in the early days of the civil wars is 
really what,

1146
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,920
what made it so that the republic,
there was no,

1147
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:42,720
I don't feel like there was any coming 
back from that.

1148
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,120
You had mentioned when Kayas,
Caracas was,

1149
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:49,200
was looking at his broad range of 
reforms you had talked about,

1150
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:50,640
had they,
I'm going from memory here,

1151
00:54:50,641 --> 00:54:55,641
but you'd said if they had been enacted,
it would have foreseen a lot of the 

1152
00:54:55,641 --> 00:54:59,721
changes that Augustus era Roman reforms 
had implemented and obviously a long 

1153
00:55:01,861 --> 00:55:04,890
time ahead of time if something like 
that had gone forward.

1154
00:55:04,891 --> 00:55:07,950
Is that the example of a reform moment 
that had to come to pass,

1155
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:12,980
uh,
the inevitable death spiral that 

1156
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:12,980
happened might have been avoided?

1157
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,600
I think so.
And it's because they're,

1158
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:19,610
there would not have been quite the 
energy or the impetus to,

1159
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:23,490
um,
to just crack the state in half,

1160
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,170
right.
It,

1161
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:29,910
you get to a point where if you're 
governing apparatus or whatever it 

1162
00:55:29,971 --> 00:55:33,000
happens to be,
if enough people start to feel like that

1163
00:55:33,001 --> 00:55:35,460
governing apparatus is not working for 
them,

1164
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,770
it's not doing anything.
For me personally,

1165
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:41,310
why do I owe it as an institution,
any kind of loyalty,

1166
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:46,050
my loyalty ought to go to the thing or 
to the people or in the Roman case,

1167
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:51,051
oftentimes to the general who's going to
be guaranteeing me the kind of security 

1168
00:55:51,051 --> 00:55:53,520
that I want in life,
which is I want a plot of land.

1169
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:56,100
I want decent wages.
I want a,

1170
00:55:56,101 --> 00:55:57,900
I want someplace to be able to settle 
in,

1171
00:55:57,901 --> 00:56:02,901
retire when I'm done here.
By the time you get to the later 

1172
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:05,030
republic that is providable by,
by warlords,

1173
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:05,940
uh,
which is,

1174
00:56:05,941 --> 00:56:10,941
you know,
you could absolutely describe Caesar as 

1175
00:56:10,941 --> 00:56:10,941
a warlord,
um,

1176
00:56:10,941 --> 00:56:14,720
once,
once it starts to become those guys who 

1177
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,361
are delivering on the promises that,
that are being made rather than the 

1178
00:56:17,361 --> 00:56:18,090
state itself.

1179
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,350
Yeah.
There's,

1180
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:23,620
what is it that they had to be loyal to 
the Senate and people of Rome abstractly

1181
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:24,540
for,
um,

1182
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,880
so when you,
when you get to these moments when you 

1183
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,881
can make some of these,
when you can have a little bit of 

1184
00:56:32,881 --> 00:56:33,630
foresight and say to yourself,
or is this model working for,

1185
00:56:33,631 --> 00:56:37,570
for the entire citizen population?
Or is it just working for a tiny elite,

1186
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:42,990
you know,
once you start ignoring the rest of the 

1187
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:42,990
citizens and say,
ah,

1188
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:43,480
it's working for a tiny elite,
but that's fine.

1189
00:56:43,481 --> 00:56:47,770
They'll just accept it.
You do create a breach of legitimacy and

1190
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:50,890
you do a alienate people to the point 
where they're not.

1191
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,320
No,
they're no longer loyal to the system at

1192
00:56:53,321 --> 00:56:58,321
all.
And that's how you get people just 

1193
00:56:58,321 --> 00:56:58,321
crashing it over.
And,

1194
00:56:58,321 --> 00:56:59,440
and most people practically not even 
caring.

1195
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:00,300
And you.
Yeah.

1196
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:03,040
The private military thing which used to
be illegal in Rome.

1197
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,360
Why did the Romans,
why,

1198
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,400
why did the,
the citizenry or the Senate put up with 

1199
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:09,400
the change that.
I mean,

1200
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,891
if you wanted to put the major thing 
that the founding fathers of the United 

1201
00:57:13,891 --> 00:57:17,370
States,
of course tried to do was to make sure 

1202
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:17,370
that the citizen,
uh,

1203
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:19,150
leadership controlled the military so 
that we had that separation,

1204
00:57:19,151 --> 00:57:24,151
but,
but they kind of had that separation in 

1205
00:57:24,151 --> 00:57:24,151
Rome once upon a time.
What made,

1206
00:57:24,151 --> 00:57:25,210
and we'll make this the last question,
but what made the,

1207
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,610
the,
the circumstances or,

1208
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:30,290
or public opinion or senatorial opinion?
Um,

1209
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:33,280
I was going to say change,
but the word might be put up.

1210
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:37,330
Why did they put up with it?
The raising of private armies?

1211
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:42,390
Yeah.
The reason why they put up with it 

1212
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:45,060
initially was because Rome was facing an
emergency military situation,

1213
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:50,750
um,
where they were sort of simultaneously 

1214
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:53,730
around the age of,
around Maria because Maria is sort of 

1215
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:53,730
the great,
you know,

1216
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:58,051
it,
it had been moving in this direction of 

1217
00:57:58,051 --> 00:58:00,500
um,
just a backup in case people don't know 

1218
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:00,500
this,
uh,

1219
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:00,500
previously to serve in the legions.

1220
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,050
You had to own a certain amount of 
property.

1221
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,260
You actually had to literally be rich 
enough to serve in the legions.

1222
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,590
And by the middle of of the book,
by in the middle of the storm,

1223
00:58:08,591 --> 00:58:13,591
before the storm,
you get Marius making this fateful 

1224
00:58:13,591 --> 00:58:16,920
request for an exemption from that 
requirement and just let me enroll any 

1225
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,980
warm body who wants to show up and I'll 
train them and I'll teach them how to be

1226
00:58:20,981 --> 00:58:22,350
soldiers.
That was.

1227
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:27,390
That was a fairly momentous change in in
how the Romans conducted politics and 

1228
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:32,371
war and does have a lot to do with that.
Those people who are now going to be 

1229
00:58:32,711 --> 00:58:37,711
loyal more to their general than to the 
state because it's the general who's 

1230
00:58:37,711 --> 00:58:41,940
going to be providing them and 
guaranteeing them a the riches and land 

1231
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,060
that they hope to get out of their 
service.

1232
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:46,450
So the reason why I think in that moment
why the Senate says,

1233
00:58:46,451 --> 00:58:47,170
okay,
yeah you can,

1234
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,800
you can draft anybody is that they had.

1235
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:54,830
They had an ongoing war in north Africa.
There was a huge slave rebellion that 

1236
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:56,650
had consumed a,
that had consumed Sicily.

1237
00:58:56,890 --> 00:59:01,890
And then the kimbery this,
this great Germanic hoard that it 

1238
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:04,000
would've just been sort of wandering 
around Europe for like 15 years,

1239
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,020
would constantly come back around and 
the north.

1240
00:59:07,021 --> 00:59:08,770
So the northern border was very 
insecure.

1241
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,320
So I think it was,
it was,

1242
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:13,600
it was a matter of just like,
like in this emergency situation,

1243
00:59:13,601 --> 00:59:16,150
we need to raise men and we need to 
raise a lot of men.

1244
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:17,890
So yeah,
just go ahead and do it.

1245
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:22,310
And I think from that point on they just
sort of realized that,

1246
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,240
um,
uh,

1247
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:29,330
this was,
this was a way to keep up with the 

1248
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:29,390
manpower needs that their empire now 
have.

1249
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:34,391
They were no longer just this little 
city state that was occasionally 

1250
00:59:34,391 --> 00:59:34,880
skirmishing with the Sam nights down 
around capital a.

1251
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:35,630
This is,
you know,

1252
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,450
we have,
we have garrison's we need to be filling

1253
00:59:38,451 --> 00:59:41,150
in Spain and North Africa and up and 
Gaul.

1254
00:59:41,151 --> 00:59:44,570
And as a,
as they move into goal of the Macedonian

1255
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:46,460
frontier over in Greece,
they're now,

1256
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:49,040
they're now in charge of western Turkey.
Um,

1257
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:54,640
how,
how are we going to keep the legions 

1258
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:54,640
filled?
I think once,

1259
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,030
I think once they made the decision to 
go over to like,

1260
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:58,580
let's just drop this property 
requirement in general,

1261
00:59:58,581 --> 01:00:03,581
I think it was fairly wildly successful 
in terms of their ability to raise the 

1262
01:00:03,581 --> 01:00:07,160
men needed to run their empire and then 
you know,

1263
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:12,220
how does,
how does that move over to the real 

1264
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:15,281
danger point,
which is people raising personal armies 

1265
01:00:15,281 --> 01:00:18,370
and I think a lot of this like a decent 
enough analogy like not exactly is like 

1266
01:00:19,011 --> 01:00:24,011
a political party going and looking for 
a candidate who can sell finance their 

1267
01:00:24,011 --> 01:00:26,990
campaign,
political parties at the state level,

1268
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:27,890
at the national level.

1269
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:30,290
Always love a candidate who can walk in 
and say,

1270
01:00:30,291 --> 01:00:30,980
oh,
by the way,

1271
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:33,230
like the party doesn't need to give me 
any money.

1272
01:00:33,231 --> 01:00:38,231
I'll just do.
I'll just do this all out of my own 

1273
01:00:38,231 --> 01:00:38,231
pocket.
Because I'm,

1274
01:00:38,231 --> 01:00:38,231
you know,
I'm a,

1275
01:00:38,231 --> 01:00:38,980
I'm a hedge fund manager.
I am a,

1276
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:44,100
an owner of a business or like Michael 
Bloomberg is just like whatever it is 

1277
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:44,330
that he's sitting on top of.
Right?

1278
01:00:44,331 --> 01:00:46,430
Like he,
like the Democratic Party didn't need to

1279
01:00:46,431 --> 01:00:51,431
give him any money.
He could just do it all himself and the 

1280
01:00:51,431 --> 01:00:52,000
same was really true of,
uh,

1281
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:54,290
of later if people like pompey,
uh,

1282
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,460
who could say,
Hey,

1283
01:00:55,461 --> 01:00:57,320
I'm going to go,
I can go raise my own army.

1284
01:00:57,380 --> 01:00:59,240
Like you don't even,
you don't even have to worry about it.

1285
01:00:59,241 --> 01:01:01,730
Like you elect me console,
I'll do all the work for Ya.

1286
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,230
Um,
that's a,

1287
01:01:03,231 --> 01:01:08,231
that's a very,
that's a very immediately attractive 

1288
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:08,540
proposition for most people,
especially out there.

1289
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:11,060
Maybe you don't want to go to war,
but you have a candidate who was like,

1290
01:01:11,061 --> 01:01:16,061
don't worry,
I'll get my guys myself and you don't 

1291
01:01:16,061 --> 01:01:16,061
have to do it if you don't want to.
Um,

1292
01:01:16,061 --> 01:01:20,350
that's where you start getting these 
personal legions being raised and once 

1293
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:21,980
those personal legions are being raised 
again,

1294
01:01:21,981 --> 01:01:23,030
now we're just,
you know,

1295
01:01:23,031 --> 01:01:28,031
the late republic is just a clash of 
warlords and that is really right now 

1296
01:01:28,031 --> 01:01:28,250
when you look at it and you say,
okay,

1297
01:01:28,251 --> 01:01:33,251
I see some similarities,
but there some real big differences and 

1298
01:01:33,251 --> 01:01:33,251
we haven't gotten there yet.
Right?

1299
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:34,390
Sure.
And I,

1300
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,250
I mean honestly like the military thing,
you know,

1301
01:01:37,251 --> 01:01:42,251
the United States has gone through a bit
of a similar process after Vietnam where

1302
01:01:42,501 --> 01:01:44,180
we said we're no longer going to do 
this,

1303
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:49,181
like temporary conscription into an army
to go off and fight and instead we're 

1304
01:01:49,181 --> 01:01:51,050
going to make it all volunteer and um,
and all professional,

1305
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:51,710
right?

1306
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:52,880
I mean,
that's a similarity.

1307
01:01:52,881 --> 01:01:56,510
But there's so much about the 
institutional,

1308
01:01:56,930 --> 01:02:01,100
what the US Army,
the US Navy institutionally is,

1309
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:06,400
um,
does not resemble the personal warlord 

1310
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,660
legions of the late republic.
Right?

1311
01:02:07,661 --> 01:02:12,090
Like the paymaster is not your kernel.
The paymaster is,

1312
01:02:12,110 --> 01:02:13,880
is really,
it's the United States of America.

1313
01:02:13,881 --> 01:02:15,070
And we can,
you know,

1314
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:19,350
our checks don't ever bounce when they 
go out there to some private or sergeant

1315
01:02:19,351 --> 01:02:24,351
or some major.
So you don't have them being loyal 

1316
01:02:24,351 --> 01:02:26,670
specifically to just one,
just one commander out there.

1317
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:28,020
And then I have also heard,
you know,

1318
01:02:28,021 --> 01:02:33,021
I've,
I've had the good fortune to be friends 

1319
01:02:33,021 --> 01:02:35,181
with a lots of veterans guys who were in
the military now or who have left and 

1320
01:02:35,181 --> 01:02:39,330
are now veterans just back out in the 
civilian world with the rest of us that,

1321
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:41,630
I mean,
there's enough that goes on with trooper

1322
01:02:41,631 --> 01:02:42,750
rotations,
right,

1323
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:44,250
where you're kind of bouncing between 
units.

1324
01:02:44,251 --> 01:02:49,251
You're,
you're never forming one of these like 

1325
01:02:49,251 --> 01:02:50,160
20 year long bonds where you guys have 
all been serving together forever.

1326
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,140
Um,
so I don't,

1327
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:57,180
I,
I don't fear right now like the role of 

1328
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:57,180
the US army,
uh,

1329
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,020
in some kind of a,
in some kind of war,

1330
01:02:59,021 --> 01:03:02,640
Lord style clash.
I don't see it happening anytime soon.

1331
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,690
One of the great firewalls that's 
actually working still.

1332
01:03:05,691 --> 01:03:07,160
Right.
I hope so.

1333
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:09,410
Listen,
is there anything,

1334
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:14,411
Mike,
that I didn't ask you about that you 

1335
01:03:14,411 --> 01:03:14,411
want to make sure we know about the book
or some of the story?

1336
01:03:14,411 --> 01:03:18,941
Uh,
I specifically focused on the things 

1337
01:03:18,941 --> 01:03:21,160
that I was interested in,
but there's a heck of a lot in this 

1338
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:21,160
piece.
What else should the listeners know?

1339
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:21,420
Well,
I think,

1340
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:23,550
I think the one thing that we didn't 
touch on that is a,

1341
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:28,600
that is a pretty major part of the book 
that has similarities to the United 

1342
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:32,780
States is this issue of the non.
The Non Roman Italians were.

1343
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:33,410
Sure,
sure.

1344
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:38,440
Yeah.
Were just in case you don't know the 

1345
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:38,440
backstory of this here,
I'll do it real quick,

1346
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,390
is that when Rome conquered Italy during
the Sam night wars,

1347
01:03:41,391 --> 01:03:44,630
which is a couple of hundred years 
before my book comes along.

1348
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:50,340
Um,
the Romans did not annex these people 

1349
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:50,720
directly into the Roman state.
They instead signed these,

1350
01:03:50,721 --> 01:03:52,520
uh,
these treaties with the city,

1351
01:03:52,521 --> 01:03:57,521
so a city in an area or a city and 
Umbria would then become merely an ally 

1352
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:58,930
of realm.
And when,

1353
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,960
whenever the Romans came around to ask 
for a legionaries for the army's,

1354
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:08,050
the city had to provide them.
But other than that they were mostly 

1355
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:08,050
left to their own devices.

1356
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:10,310
They could govern themselves.
They weren't really taxed that heavily.

1357
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:14,060
But what happens is when you get to the 
period of my book,

1358
01:04:14,061 --> 01:04:19,061
a couple hundred years later,
these guys had been inside of Roman 

1359
01:04:19,061 --> 01:04:20,540
civilization in every meaningful way for
hundreds of years.

1360
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:23,390
And yet they were still,
you couldn't even call them second class

1361
01:04:23,391 --> 01:04:25,520
citizens.
They were not citizens at all.

1362
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,430
Uh,
and they're facing the same problems,

1363
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:31,130
the same economic problems that they're 
roman cousins are,

1364
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:34,640
except they don't even have the right to
vote in an assembly.

1365
01:04:34,641 --> 01:04:37,730
They don't even have the right to send 
candidates for office and be like,

1366
01:04:37,731 --> 01:04:38,030
well,
Hey,

1367
01:04:38,031 --> 01:04:41,390
what about us?
So they were on top of everything else.

1368
01:04:41,391 --> 01:04:43,040
They,
they were facing economic,

1369
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:47,540
economic problems and also didn't have 
any kind of political voice at all.

1370
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:52,810
And so that combined with the sort of,
the general problems that are created by

1371
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:58,430
the skyrocketing economic inequality,
that leads to a [inaudible] style,

1372
01:04:58,431 --> 01:05:01,930
confrontational style of politics that 
now defines,

1373
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:05,200
that now defines the Republican,
that entire force of it,

1374
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:06,470
again,
like energy,

1375
01:05:06,471 --> 01:05:07,430
I guess you could call it.

1376
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:12,830
Um,
the Italian question is what's 

1377
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:15,160
ultimately triggers the great civil wars
of Maurice and Sala is the Italians 

1378
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,740
constantly demanding citizenship.
The Romans constantly saying,

1379
01:05:17,741 --> 01:05:22,741
we're not going to give you citizenship,
and what it finally takes is a massive 

1380
01:05:22,741 --> 01:05:26,461
bloody and destructive civil war where 
the Italians are not trying to break 

1381
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:31,800
away from Roman rule.
They're trying to force their way into 

1382
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:31,800
Roman road.
It was a.

1383
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:36,270
it's going to be a war on behalf of 
political equality rather than a war 

1384
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:38,160
premised on political independence.
So that's,

1385
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:41,110
that's like the other big thing that's 
floating around out there,

1386
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:42,360
but other than that,
you just.

1387
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,920
You just read the book and I'll explain 
it all to you.

1388
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:50,660
As one of my professors said,
every educated person in the Western 

1389
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:54,351
world should know the story that Mike 
Duncan catalogs in the storm before the 

1390
01:05:54,351 --> 01:05:58,401
storm,
the beginning of the end of the Roman 

1391
01:05:58,401 --> 01:05:58,401
republic.
Mike,

1392
01:05:58,401 --> 01:05:58,950
thank you for coming on the program.
I wish you the greatest success.

1393
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,590
Thank you very much.
Like I said,

1394
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:06,630
I think that this is the.
I think you could not have chosen a 

1395
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,991
better subject and I agree with you.
It's shocking that this doesn't already 

1396
01:06:08,991 --> 01:06:09,510
have 20 books on the bookshelf about 
this.

1397
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:11,830
Considering how awesome and like you,
I mean,

1398
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:15,130
you know,
it's hard to initiate enough disclaimers

1399
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:16,110
where you tell people,
okay,

1400
01:06:16,111 --> 01:06:18,270
there's so many different things.
It's not really like us,

1401
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,280
but look at all these things that are 
like us,

1402
01:06:20,281 --> 01:06:20,640
you know?

1403
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:22,340
Yeah.
I figured if,

1404
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:27,380
if,
if you're going to do it because like 

1405
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:27,470
one of the things that I always push 
against is that I don't think that we're

1406
01:06:27,471 --> 01:06:30,370
anywhere near like the fall of Rome,
which is,

1407
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:32,090
which is something that you hear from 
people like,

1408
01:06:32,091 --> 01:06:37,091
oh,
the Syrian refugees are just like the 

1409
01:06:37,091 --> 01:06:37,091
vandals.
No,

1410
01:06:37,091 --> 01:06:37,500
not really.
No.

1411
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:42,600
Wait,
can we start killing each other over 

1412
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:42,600
political things then we're starting to 
move a little bit in the are.

1413
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:42,940
I mean,
yeah,

1414
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:47,950
like if,
if we actually have like a mass 

1415
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:47,950
migrating population that has like an 
entire,

1416
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:52,880
uh,
entire armed force that can go toe to 

1417
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:53,660
toe with the US army,
then I guess,

1418
01:06:53,661 --> 01:06:54,890
yeah,
we can start talking about it,

1419
01:06:54,891 --> 01:06:56,420
but I don't think we're anywhere near 
that.

1420
01:06:56,421 --> 01:07:00,240
I think your $300 senators with Tiberius
Grok as.

1421
01:07:00,241 --> 01:07:03,080
I think that's the moment where the,
the sea change would happen.

1422
01:07:03,081 --> 01:07:04,310
Yeah,
I think,

1423
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:08,260
I think that that period of the Grok 
eyes is enough that I'm,

1424
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:12,630
I'm happy to now insert this idea into 
people's heads and saying like,

1425
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:14,630
this is the period we need to be paying 
attention.

1426
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,030
Important.
Exactly.

1427
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:21,031
It's not just for interesting.
It's like that's what my professor was 

1428
01:07:21,031 --> 01:07:21,880
pointing out that if you're an American 
in this system,

1429
01:07:21,881 --> 01:07:26,881
this is a story that our founding 
fathers thought was worth knowing 

1430
01:07:26,881 --> 01:07:28,420
probably for an informed citizenry of a,
of a modern commercial.

1431
01:07:28,421 --> 01:07:32,140
Imperial Republic might be a good idea 
to buy Mike Duncan's book.

1432
01:07:32,141 --> 01:07:33,670
So that's the way I'm going to phrase 
it.

1433
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:34,420
Uh,
if dude,

1434
01:07:34,421 --> 01:07:35,210
if I can do anything

1435
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:36,150
for you,
I'm here.

1436
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:37,230
Okay,
great.

1437
01:07:37,231 --> 01:07:38,760
I really appreciate it.
That was fun.

1438
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:44,400
My thanks to Mike Duncan.
It was great to finally digitally 

1439
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,191
interact with him.
Go out and pick up the storm before the 

1440
01:07:47,191 --> 01:07:48,310
storm.
We will link to it on our website.

1441
01:07:48,311 --> 01:07:53,311
If you pick it up through Amazon,
why don't you do so through our search 

1442
01:07:53,311 --> 01:07:55,630
window at Dan Carlin Dot com and that 
will help us out too.

1443
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:05,750
Sure.
The older hardcore history shows can be 

1444
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:08,331
a bit traumatic with titles like death 
throes of the republic judgment at 

1445
01:08:08,431 --> 01:08:13,431
Nineveh and addicted to bondage.
We just consider that to be truth in 

1446
01:08:13,501 --> 01:08:15,270
advertising.
No pain,

1447
01:08:15,271 --> 01:08:20,271
no gain is Armato.
Pick up the entire catalog from Dan
