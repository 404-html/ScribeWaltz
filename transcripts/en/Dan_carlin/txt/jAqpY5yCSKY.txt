Speaker 1:          00:00:00       What you're about to hear is part four of a multipart series on the first world war, if you like, your stories to have some sort of cohesive linear narrative flow. Although I'm not promising that I probably couldn't deliver on that, but if that's what you like, we're probably better off suggesting you go check out episode number one and work your way to hear. If you don't care about that kind of stuff at all, or you just don't trust me to deliver a cohesive linear narrative flow and I wouldn't blame you. Well then by all means, start here at part four and check out this series that we're calling blueprint for Armageddon.

Speaker 2:          00:00:33       Be Bus seven, 19, 41, a date which will live in infamy.

Speaker 1:          00:00:43       It's history.

Speaker 3:          00:00:48       Perfect.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       The events

Speaker 4:          00:00:56       that dude figures from this time and place,

Speaker 5:          00:01:06       I take pride in the words, been the Alina,

Speaker 4:          00:01:14       tear down, complete collapse. Welcome this kind of examination because people have got to know whether or not the president said, well, I'm not a crop. If we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, I don't remember if we are not descended from fearful of man,

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       it's hardcore history. How do you market war,

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       how do you sell combat to the people who are actually going to have to engage in it? It's not a hypothetical question, by the way. Any military that requires volunteers to decide they want to join the service has to think about how you actually sell the idea to the people who you know have to take part in it. An idea that carries with it the potential for some very nasty outcomes in the very worst of circumstances, doesn't it? So difficult job perhaps to market combat. It's easier to do in peace time though, right? If you have to sell Suntan oil to people in Alaska, you might be able to pull that off in the summer in December. It's a really tough sell before the first world war breaks out. If you're trying to market recruitment into the British army, you can sell the same sort of talking points, the same soda angles that have worked for governments and monarchies and tribes.

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       Going back to the beginning of civilization, the military has long had certain selling points. I think we're all familiar with them. You could add regular pay thrown in to that as well. The heroism, the adventure, the status. I mean, you know, there's a lot of things. Some people just like to fight. I mean, you never know. The problem is is that that's a pre 1914, you know, talking point when it comes to what happens when the first world war breaks out and how that just totally messes with your marketing strategy. Unless you're marketing hell as a travel destination, you can't, no matter how much precedence or ship you have, and the British had plenty in the first world war, just like everyone else, you can't mask those kinds of casualty number. Now you can mask the reality, the sort of stuff that some of these newspaper reporters who were censored during the war, after the war, you know, they would write books, telling you the real story, what really happened because you couldn't have imagined it and it was all censored by the press.

Speaker 1:          00:04:01       Even with the censorship, you can't hide the death and destruction and dismemberment and you see the people returning to your hometown with the horrible wounds and you hear some of the rumors and stories, you know it's not going to be fun. All of a sudden the marketers in Great Britain's recruitment operation have to play hard ball no more just throwing out carrots they're going to use some sticks to. In the US. We have a 21st century volunteer army ourselves and the US uses just carrots to encourage people to join up. We'll pay you more. We'll pay you for college. You'll make something of your life. I mean, there's all these different things that they used to motivate people, but there's not very many sticks in the US system. Once the first couple of weeks of the first world war happened and everybody together finds out how enormous this is going to be an in an absolutely stunning group.

Speaker 1:          00:04:56       Wake up call where the light goes on over everyone's head and they're going, oh my gosh, we don't have enough resources and oh my gosh, we don't have enough money for a war like this, and Oh my gosh, we don't have enough people, and even some of these larger states where you think to yourself, all you know, people shouldn't be a problem. Look at how many people are coming up. Every generation. Remember manpower in the old, you know, air quotes means manpower across the board. Not just the people fighting on the front line, but the people that can still be minors to extract the material you need to carry on the war or people working in arms manufacturing plants so that they can build the bombs you need to fight the war. In other words, if you take too much to throw on the fighting line, you won't have enough people back home making the stuff that the people on the fighting line need to win.

Speaker 1:          00:05:45       Man, power becomes a very big deal. All these other countries in the war, Germany, France, Russia, no problem. They've spent decades working out a conscription operation where they draft people, you know, you come of age, you do a couple of years in the service and then you become parts of the reserves and then you become parts of the other reserve and the heavier and older reserve and you know, after a while they've got a whole revolving self perpetuating system in place. Whereas every generation comes up, they're cranking out new soldiers except for Great Britain there, the last volunteer service in involved in this conflict. When it breaks out, it puts unique pressures on them. The first thing they do is simply ask people to join up. And remember in 1914 you didn't quite know what you were in for. You could still sell the old selling points.

Speaker 1:          00:06:31       The uniforms are wonderful and the women, you'll look dashing and it just be, you know, I mean war adventure killed the Bosch, you know, all the good methods that king needs. You, king and country, all the things that have always worked and still work by the way. And a lot of cases, especially in peace time. Um, worked in more folks in Britain. And Scotland and Canada and Australia and all these places signed up than they even could handle. They were looking for a couple of hundred thousand, got a lot more than that, but that's before the casualties start happening. A lot of patriotic Britain signup, but you don't know how many patriotic Britain's journey you're going to need and not just in one big lump, but every month to replace the troops. You lose. In late 1915, the British just lose at Gullapalli and they walk away after a couple of months with 250,000 casualties.

Speaker 1:          00:07:20       You don't just replace those by playing nice and easy and saying, come and fight for king and country. You're using more hardball methods, and one of the ones that I've always thought was just indicative of something that if you imagined it in modern times, it boggles the mind using a strategy like this today, but it's absolute genius. It shows exactly the most vulnerable point in a young man's psyche. I mean the place where if you're a marketer, you're looking for, for you know, what motivates people, how you can touch these, these elements of influence in the order of the feather. The white feather movement is absolutely brilliant in that regard. I mean, it's almost devious. You try to imagine our government doing something like this today with modern 21st century technology. It's interesting to think about, but basically, you know when August, early September, 19, 14 rolls around, there's an admiral in the British admiralty who's, who's working like everyone else to think about, well, how can we encourage more people to sign up for this horrible war and comes up with, you know, and an attack on a motivation, a marketing strategy.

Speaker 1:          00:08:22       He's going to enlist patriotic young British women to walk the streets of all these towns in Britain, their hometowns. You know, where there are people they know and if they see men not in uniform, who looked like they could be or should be, they are going to go up, surround this person and start saying the most horrible thing. You are a coward and all these terrible things to them. In know pretty women in public dressing you down if you're 18 years old, that's a pretty good marketing chink in arm or to exploit, not just that you're probably in. Usually we're on the streets of your hometown where the pastors by no you or your family. This is a profoundly embarrassing moment, you know, for, for everyone around you, everyone connected with you. God forbid if you have a girlfriend, she's gonna think this looks pretty bad for her too. I mean, the effect was, was huge. And then before this little group of women, um, we're done with you. They would put a white feather signifying cowardice on your lapel or somewhere very visible, you know, on you.

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       This was not an unusual occurrence. There are accounts for people that say they were afraid to go outside the house sometimes because these patriotic and zealous women who were really just trying to help. That's the funny part. This is the society motivating, patriotism, all these things, right? It's, it's all the right virtues. But I've got an account from a 16 year old boy who had to go through this and then he signed up for the service because he was so deathly embarrassed and afraid and an inch and ashamed and the service person laughed him out of the room, but then said he looked so downtrodden, he exaggerated this height, exaggerated, does age, exaggerated his weight, and he was in at 16 under 110 pounds on the western front. It's absolutely deviously clever. Once again, I try to imagine us using it today.

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       You know, these ideas could backfire though. These creative marketing recruitment ideas, for example, the government felt the need to put out symbols that people could wear who had already done their service overseas and had been wounded and honorably discharged or who worked for some really important armaments or war related industry and couldn't be spared because apparently enough of those people were being mistakenly given the order of the white feather treatment to make that an important thing for the government to do. There were other creative marketing plans, not sticks but carrots and one of them, another brilliant one. When you think about it on the surface, involve the British government explaining to recruits that if you sign up with your pals, your buddies, you could all serve together as well. People joined up from the same street or the same pub or the same community or the same fraternity or the same profession and they all serve together and they had wonderful names.

Speaker 1:          00:11:18       These are like military unit names that they're still known by. I mean there were the Liverpool pals or the grimsby chums and these friends all went to the service. She figured if you've got to serve, you might as well do it with your friends, but then you get to watch your friends die. It's the part we didn't really consider when we signed up and it sounded kind of fun. Not just that when these units would get decimated in some of these terrible encounters. For example, you can be walking down a road with your pals in the open and all of a sudden get caught by our Taylor refire, suffer 80 percent casualties and then instead of the losses and the suffering and the grief being spread out, sort of diluted across the width and breadth of the entire British isles or British empire for that matter, some local community or some fraternity or some profession just gets pounded and there are villages and towns in Britain now that had these terrible days just happened to the whole community and pretty much everybody suffers a major loss one way or the other, and if the downside of that clever marketing plan by 1916, there's nothing clever enough to get enough people in uniform.

Speaker 1:          00:12:25       The losses are so high that the British finally do what the British really don't do and they started conscripting their people. It's hard to blame the British for starting the same sort of draft that the continental great powers use. All you have to do. As we said, the casualties were so high. Look at the. By the end of Nineteen 15, the British have suffered half a million casualties, 200,000 of those are dead by the way, for a traditionally naval power who has traditionally are rather small army by continental standards. Those are huge numbers. Now you want to see what continental standards look like. Look at the British ally, the French who had a huge army in the meat grinder since the first minute of this whole affair, and by the end of Nineteen 15 there casualties are over 2 million. More than 700,000 of those are dead and all these great powers are looking at their principal enemies and trying to figure out how close they are to the throwing in the towel moment.

Speaker 1:          00:13:25       The Germans are looking at the French and all the casualties they have suffered, and then you're looking in their thinking. They must be close to the end of their rope. The Germans have suffered more casualties by the end of 1915, then the French, but they're fighting on more fronts, right? They're fighting the French and the British in the west, the gigantic Russian forces in the east and they're involved in the Balkans a lot. In 1915 there, casualties by the end of 1915 or over two and a half million, about 750,000 of those are dead hard to know. The Germans list 250,000 missing in this war. People got blown to bits. They got covered up by a giant mountains of earth that Shell's had blown up in the air, falling back on the ground. A lot of missing people probably between 750 and 800,000 dead for the Germans at this point in the war.

Speaker 1:          00:14:15       The Russians have suffered titanic losses from minute one. They lost a huge battle in 1915 called um, Gorley's tarnoff. We're to least a ton off. And that battle all by itself, they lost 150,000 dead, almost 700,000 wounded and basically a million prisoners. Those titanic losses, maybe it's easier to understand their monthly burn rate by October 1915. The Russians are losing 235,000 men a month. How sustainable is that? You again, you got to be looking at the Russians thinking they're almost done and the German high command kind of is now. The Germans can't be too happy though because their main ally, the Austrian Hungarians are suffering casualties that are every bit as momentous as the Russians, but they don't have the manpower to back that up. I mean in one four month period in 1915, one four month period, the Austrian suffer 750,000 casualties. Boom. That's in addition to the already astounding casualties they took in the few months right after the war started.

Speaker 1:          00:15:28       The Germans several times we'll have to prop up the Austrians just to keep them able to continue in the conflict and the Austrians are a pain in the rear to their German allies. A lot of the time mean for Eric on Falcon and the German commander in charge in January of 1916. He can't stand them. They are always getting into some sort of disaster that they then go to Falcon Hein and ask for help getting out of and to make matters worse, it's usually a disaster that fund falcon hind and warned them about in advance. Don't do that. It'll be a disaster. And then they do it against his wishes and then come and ask to be bailed out multiple times. They can always play their, their trump card though, against, on Falcon Hine, legitimately considering the huge casualties they've suffered. They can kind of go there and say, well listen, I mean, you know, if you don't help us, uh, we're not that far from dropping out of the war.

Speaker 1:          00:16:16       I don't know. I can't guarantee you will be here and you know, you have to help them. Or it's a strategic disaster if the Austro-hungarian dropout of the war. Right, but fun Falcon Hind doesn't want to pay any attention to any of these other friends. He doesn't want to worry about the Russians. There are German generals and whatnot. They keep saying, we need to focus on the Russians. That's how we win the war. Falcon. I didn't want to hear about that, doesn't want to focus in the Balkans, although in 1915 they destroy Serbia, just get that out of the way, fall behind, doesn't want to hear about the Middle East and the Turkey doesn't want to talk about Australia and her problem doesn't want to know what he's doing. He wants to focus on this maybe war winning or war, losing Gordian Knot. That is the puzzle that must be solved if you are a general task with winning this war.

Speaker 1:          00:17:03       It's the western front. How do you deal with that and it and it's an unprecedented problem. You know there's a famous German saying that may or may not have happened, but it's infused this whole period where one German general is supposed to have commented about how amazingly the British troops fought and he said they're lions and the sub commander with him is supposed to have said something to the effect of Yes, lucky for us, they are led by donkeys. Nineteen 15 is western front. Battles are where the donkeys first get labeled with that sort of reputation. At the same time, when you realize that they have no metrics for what they're doing in 1915, this has never been done before. Nobody's ever had this kind of firepower and nobody's ever put these kinds of defenses up. I mean, we're playing with all sorts of new military toys and they've never been tested.

Speaker 1:          00:17:58       In a situation like this, how much slack do you cut the generals and give them what is sometimes called by historians, in this case, a learning curve when you're playing with people's lives, how slowly are you allowed to figure things out? We didn't go into any of the 1915 battles. Winston Churchill is just one of many people who object to the whole idea of calling those battles. In the 19, 15 year or 1916 year or 1917 year battles, he says it's a disservice to what the name means. You said there were battles in 1914 at the start of the war and there were battles in 1918 at the end of the war, but that stuff in the middle was a siege. He writes, quote, these sanguinary prodigious struggles extending over many months are often loosely described as battles, judging by the number of men who took their turn in the fighting at different times by the immense quantities of guns and shells employed and by the hideous casualty totals.

Speaker 1:          00:18:59       They certainly rank taken as a whole among the largest events in military history, but we must not be misled by terminology. You have to call them. Battles was merely a method of presenting a general view of an otherwise confusing picture. It might well pass unchallenged, but an attempt has been made by military commanders and buy a whole school of writers to represent these prolonged operations as events comparable to the decisive battles of the past. Only larger and more important to yield to this specious argument is to be drawn into a wholly wrong impression, both of military science and of what actually took place in the Great War and quote, these battles on the western front for a full three years in the conflict look pretty much like this as described by historian older. Her vague quote, the fighting on the western front had taken on a deadly regularity.

Speaker 1:          00:20:00       Attackers stormed enemy trenches in waves only to be mowed down by hostile machine gun firing artillery, as they tried to cut the wire, entanglements that protected the earthworks and quote, there's a repetitiveness to the fighting on the western front. It's a repetitiveness that actually is associated with World War One and the western front specifically. It's part of the tragedy. It adds to the pain because after all, if you've seen this same event over and over and over again, doesn't it become a different kind of tragic? If you watch the first wave of those young soldiers leave the safety of their trench, go over the top at the whistle of their officer, get down by machine gunfire before they've even gone 10 feet. That's tragic. It's another level of tragedy. When the next wave gets up right behind them to follow in their footsteps. Having already seen what happened to them.

Speaker 1:          00:21:03       That's what we wanted to capture in our discussions of the western front because it became an issue early on how we were going to deal with all these battles that were roughly the same, equally tragic and for the soldiers on the ground. Eerily similar when trying to figure out what we wanted to highlight. A shakespeare quote kept popping into my head when I was working on this and it was his line that all the world's a stage and all the people merely players and I thought to myself, well, that's what we have here. We have one of the most extreme stages in human history we've created with these western front battles in 1915, 19, 16, 1917, a hell like environment and then we force millions of people to act in it, but some of the most extreme situations people have been put into ever in history and watching how they endured is sometimes soul crushing. But at other times it's absolutely life enhancing. No, sometimes you can benefit quite a bit from the suffering of other people.

Speaker 1:          00:22:29       As we sat down when we started this series and tried to figure out a creative approach to dealing with all these battles, one thing becomes very clear and we did some creative experiments and you quickly find out that the battles in an emotional sense reach a point of diminishing returns very quickly. You just become been benumbed by them all the scale, the intensity, the sheer horrific repetitive pounding eventually makes you stop feeling. And so rather than go from I'm indecisive and horrific battle to the next indecisive and horrific battle, we thought we would focus on a few, what we would consider to be almost signature battles, if you will. But they provide a very similar backdrop for the poor individuals who have to live in that environment and allow us to sort of examined at a human level what's going on here a little bit as best we can. And to explore some of the questions that are very intriguing about the story and not just about the human suffering that about command decisions and some of the technology and some other things. Um, hopefully interspersed with a little bit of comment about what's going on in the rest of the world. Wild this is happening. And part of what makes 1916 so difficult is there's a lot of overlapping stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:23:51       So if you tell it in a he said, she said then he said fashion. It becomes very confusing very quickly. The first thing to understand though is that 1916 comes about obviously because of plans made in late 1915. We'd said to you earlier that this was a real question for the generals about how you solve this Gordian knot that is the western front will. In late 1915, the allied command's got together at a place called chantilly and France to deal with this question. They're plan was going to be to continue to pound and pound harder, but the new aspect was they were going to make sure that everybody, all the different allied powers pounded the central powers, Germany and friends at the same time,

Speaker 1:          00:24:40       they were going to coordinate their efforts. This was going to nullify what the Germans had been doing. So far. The Germans have a great army, but they can't be everywhere at once. Luckily for them up until 1916, they weren't attacked everywhere at once, so they would use something called interior lines. It's a little like taking the center square in a game of tic TAC toe. The Germans were able to use their wonderful railway system to transfer troops from less threatened sectors to more hotspots and thereby frustrate allied efforts. So the allied plan for knocking down German fortifications in 1916 is that they're all going to attack it basically the same time frustrating. The Germans ability to move troops to hotspots. The Germans had a different plan entirely. You see the people at chantilly in 1950 new get together and decide to attack the Germans from multiple locations at the same time are still for the most part in visioning the classic military end to this war. They see the chances increased by attacking at multiple locations that you're going to crack the Germans somewhere and when you crack them, you're going to send your forces through the breach and you're going to send the cavalry through and now the Germans are going to break in. They're going to be on the run and they got to be routed towards Berlin and you know that's how these things and in the minds of people who have a very. Especially in old fashioned view of war,

Speaker 1:          00:26:02       there are dissidence to this idea who say, even on the allied side, you got it all wrong. It's not going to happen that way. The technology, the specific circumstances, the fact that there are no flying on the western front, you were dreaming and because you're dreaming, your plans aren't going to work. Right? On the German side, the people who have this attitude that that old fashioned viewpoint is just that old fashioned happened to be in positions of higher authority than the dissident generals. On the other side.

Speaker 1:          00:26:31       They've looked at the way the war is going and figured out that the casualties are the difference maker, and then all these countries are suffering because of the numbers of people that are dying. You need to increase the numbers. People who were dying, not only does it become hard to replace them, but it puts huge stresses and strains on the societies that are losing these people, their families, their governments. Some of these societies are fragile enough to simply fall apart like a house of cards. Others could have the entire population turned on the government and say, we know we've had enough. That becomes the best path to end the war in the minds of some of these generals. A guy like the leader in Germany, Eric von Falcon Hine is looking at what these 1915 battles taught him and they taught him that modern warfare on the western front turns into a meat grinder.

Speaker 1:          00:27:22       No matter what you do when he comes up with the brilliant idea. Again, most historians still think, uh, some people say it's, you know, shooting an Arrow and painting a bullseye around it afterwards. But he comes up with the brilliant idea that these meat grinders are happening no matter what you designed the battle to be like, what if you designed the battle to be like a meat grinder? What if you create a meat grinder and then entice the enemy to come into it if that's what's so effective on the battlefield? What if you planned to grind meat instead of having it be a byproduct of other activities and plans? And Falcon 19, late 1915 determines that the French are already, you know, near their breaking point in terms of the casualties they've suffered and he goes to the rest of the military command. He starts talking about what he'd like to do in 1916 to try to win the war. He wants to set a trap for the French army. The idea is to create one of these, you know, Modern Twentieth Century Attrition Amplifiers, one of these meat grinders and then Lou or the French army into it. For that, you need bait

Speaker 1:          00:28:33       and the determination on where this awful battles going to happen is dependent on what site can be chosen that would best play the role of Bait, and I should point out that historians from different countries disagree on this. Americans and British historians often point out that this site chosen has no real military value at all, that it was solely chosen because it's the perfect emotional bait to lure the French army into the meat grinder. German and French historians, though often assert that this site did have military importance and that that you know, did create a real military need to do what the French ended up doing. Nonetheless, the German plan is to use all this artillery first to pulverize the defenses around this important site that the French have an emotional and political and everything else attachment to below the French, off of these hills that overlooked this city. This city called Verdun, and then four to five the hills. Bring your guns up there, start shooting at the city of Verdun and wait for the French army to show up and try knock you off those hills. And knowing the superiority of prepared defenses, the French are just going to bash themselves up against your barbed wire, your trenches, your machine guns, your cannon, and everything else in a place that was specifically designed to be a killing field.

Speaker 1:          00:29:58       So thoroughly attritional bloody 20th century, way to conduct warfare, but it's not a bad idea. It also should be no surprise that a battle that was designed to act like a meat grinder turns into one of the most horrible battles of all time. Even the name, when I hear it Verdun, it's like Stalin Grad. It really is. It's one of those names that just conjures up a specific image and, and level of horror that puts it in a special place in military history. You know, it's, it's sort of like if you said, you know, where's the worst place in the world to ever be in military history? It's like a tie between a million different spots, right? Mankind's had a long enough past so that there are recurring examples of horrific places to end up on any given day. We like to cite the famous battle between the Romans and the Carthaginians. Thousands of years ago, Kenny were all those Romans were surrounded and trapped and killed over the whole long day. I mean, it's terrible, but probably about as bad as a lot of other terrible situations. There's a few where you just go, okay, that's as bad as the battle of Kony sort of. But add artillery. I mean Verdun is like nothing

Speaker 1:          00:31:17       that has ever happened really on a large scale. I'm sure. Again, mankind's long history, everything's Kinda tried. Nothing's new under the sun as they say, but for dentists, Special Verdun is so special, in fact, and so different and so outside the box for the thinking of the time period that when fall heightened comes up with the idea that he's going to bleed France white his words. It's so runs against the grain of the 19th century, sort of morality of warfare. Remember we started this war a mere year and a half ago wearing white gloves with people who dewald when they were in school together and who thought of this in an almost, especially on the western front, Golan kind of sense, right? We should exchange swords when we surrender and all this stuff, and now we have generals thinking, okay, how can I lewer millions of men into a confined space and just pound them into Marmalade to quote one French soldiers way of explaining what happened.

Speaker 1:          00:32:16       One of the things I love by the way about this period, just like I love it about the Second World War, is that we have a lot of the actual words of the generals themselves. They all wrote memoirs, as we said after the war, most of the time trying to defend their reputation against their critics because after this war, everyone's pointing fingers at everybody, you know, because it was so terrible and people were so angry and so mad generals amongst other people that they were looking to blame. Then all these generals would write pieces defending their ideas. We have faulconer Heinz, we have looted and doors. We have all these guy's memoir's now you can't take them at face value. Remember, they're trying to stake out a historical position here in defense of their own historical reputation. Nonetheless, Falcon Nine, you know, and you either love fall behind or hate him.

Speaker 1:          00:33:01       He has his fans and he has his detractors. I'm one of his fans. I liked the way his mind works and the way he writes in his book where he, you know, written right after the war where he's trying to explain his thinking on this. He runs down in logical fashion, you know, where he sees the war in 1915 and it's not that bad for the central powers. You'll hear a lot of people that will say after the Germans failed with that initial knockout blow in 1914, it was all a hard slog downhill for them. Not Necessarily

Speaker 1:          00:33:28       Nineteen 15 was a good year for the central powers. They'll have some other attempts where they'll almost win the war later in the war. So this is like, as we've said all along the heavyweight fight, and there are times when both sides have the other side in trouble. A quick look at Fall Ghanaians Memoir shows that he thinks Francis in trouble, but it's not that far from the breaking point. Here's what Falcon Hind writes about, his thinking leading up to his planning for this battle that he's most known for it for done. Falcon hine writes, quote, as I've already insisted, the strain on France has almost reached the breaking point, though it is certainly borne with the most remarkable devotion. If we succeeded in opening the eyes of her people to the fact that in the military sense they have nothing more to hope for. That breaking point would be reached and England's best sword knocked out of her hand to achieve that object. The uncertain method of a massive breakthrough in any case beyond our means is unnecessary. We can probably do enough for our purposes with limited resources within our reach behind the French sector of the western front. They are our objectives for the retention of which the French general staff would be compelled to throw in every man they have. If they do so, the forces of France will bleed to death as there can be no question of a voluntary withdrawal, whether we reach our goal or not. And to quote

Speaker 1:          00:34:49       British military historian John Keegan put it this way, quote Falcon Heinz plan was brutally simple. The French forced to fight in a crucial but narrowly constricted corner of the western front would be compelled to feed reinforcements into a battle of attrition where the material circumstances so favored the Germans. That defeat was inevitable. If the French gave up the struggle, they would lose verdun. If they persisted, they would lose their army. And to quote this plan of Falcon Heine was given the sinister sounding name of Operation Gallery, which I've seen translated multiple different ways. Usually it's called operation judgment, which implies a sort of finality that is the high hope of fall behind going into this campaign. Maybe this will decide the war, another translation you sometimes run into his court of Justice. Same sort of an idea, a decision point. The third translation though that you'll sometimes run into is more indicative of the tactics and approach that Falcon Heights going to take to win this battle.

Speaker 1:          00:35:57       It's operation place of execution and while the Kaiser and fall behind and all these generals are coming up with this plan in late 1915, the allies, the entente forces are doing the same thing and the allies a little bit lackadaisical about the whole thing. Not the Russians, not the people in the Balkans had been feeling German attacks over the last year, but the British and the French who haven't seen the German army on the offensive since way back in 1914. They're kind of leisurely planning what they think will probably be their war winning giant offensive slated for late spring or early summer, 1916 over on the river somme and enormous joined British and French effort with months of planning and and just sweeping everything in front of them. That kind of rosy outlook and the Germans instead in late February, 19, 16, go on the offensive on the western front for the first time in more than a year and catch everyone off guard.

Speaker 1:          00:36:56       It's ridiculous that they could have the amount of effort that was required to put together a modern offensive is something we modern people take for granted, but when you hear how much planning and stockpiling and engineering feats are required to pull off something like the battle of Verdun, you begin to see why it was so different than anything these people had ever known in the past. As we said, 100 years before and Napoleonic battle was considered extraordinary. If it went on for three days throughout most of human history battles take hours. These battles that these allied and central power planners are conducting require months of preparation. They all go on for months to how do you get enough stuff there to make sure your soldiers don't starve or run out of ammunition? Well, for the battle of Verdun, it was more than seven weeks of actual unloading of supplies. Here's the way writer Gj Meyer describes the planning and stockpiling before the February 1916 battle quote, the Germans. Meanwhile, we're accomplishing prodigious feats in getting everything in place, helped by the Heli, wouldn't countryside, and the cloudy winter weather of the Verdun region. They were doing an astonishingly good job of keeping the French from learning what they intended to do, or when or even exactly were no fewer than five new railway lines were constructed across the German held portion of the plateau immediately to the east of the verdant hills in a seven week period between late December and early February, 1300

Speaker 6:          00:38:36       trains, not railway cars, but entire trains hauled in two point 5 million shells, earthmoving equipment, construction machinery and everything required to prepare the offensive and support 300,000 troops in winter came rolling up to Verdun. The guns were positioned in the woods and covered with camouflage and new development in warfare made necessary by aerial reconnaissance. Underground chambers capable of holding as many as $500, million each. We're escovedo opposite the French lines and lined with steel and concrete in the sky. Above all, this was the greatest concentration of aircraft yet seen on any front 150 aircraft, a German umbrella, so impenetrable that even on the rare days when visibility was good, the French pilots were unable to get a close look at what was happening. By the second week of February, everything was in place for an offensive with the potential to change the course of the war and the German plan was complicated and it was complicated because this was one of the great defensive spots in French history for Don wasn't just a fortress. It was a fortress zone. Multiple fortresses all working together

Speaker 6:          00:39:50       ground that had been fought over since the day of Julius Caesar and the Romans fortifications that had been upgraded. Even as recently as 1914 when the lessons of what happened to those Belgian forts were incorporated, and then when the war started, the French high command decided that fortresses we're old fashioned due to the limits of new technology or rather the lack of limits. They decided that those Belgian forts being pounded by, that artillery signaled that these forts were nothing but a death trap, and it would be better to take the weapons on them and the troops that man them and put them to where the hotspots were in the fighting. After all, if Francis in a life or death struggle, what are we putting a 100,000 or more troops in the ridden region to man a bunch of fortresses that are just going to trap them and get them killed by artillery.

Speaker 6:          00:40:40       Let's put them where they're needed. Oh yeah. Make sure they bring the guns and the ammunition and everything else. So they did for don was a relatively relatively quiet sector in 1916 before the big German buildup. Nonetheless, you can't hide preparations as extensive as the German preparations for wherever the French become aware of it a couple of weeks before the Germans launch their attack and are quickly trying to make up for lost ground and get stuff, you know, to these areas because they can sense a buildup. And the Germans are launching, um, distracting attacks elsewhere to sort of confused the French on where everything's coming from. And on February 21st after a couple of postponements due to bad weather, the storm breaks, it's kicked off by a giant naval gun whose nickname, by the way, as long Max, just like naming swords, got a name the guns to apparently and long Max fires a shell that travels

Speaker 1:          00:41:34       somewhere between 15 and 20 miles. These are enormous weapons. And that becomes the first shelter drop as part of the giant barrage that kicks off the battle of Verdun. And right after long Max is barrage kicks off all these enormous weapons open up. See, it's not just between 1200 to 1500 guns, it's that half of them are huge. You have all those guns that pounded the fortunate Belgium, those giant 420 millimeter gamma mortars. You had the 380 millimeter Skoda pieces from Austria and you have more of each of them. And then you have an enormous number of 210 millimeters and, and one seventies and 1:55. And I mean my goodness, and they open up all at once and begin pounding this relatively small area of the front. What makes this so incredibly damaging is do you have these huge weapons pounding this relatively tiny area on a map and you fire an enormous number of shells by any standard, the first world war in a short period of time. So if you're on the ground at some of those 1915 battles and they're firing one point 7 million shells, but they're doing it over two or three or four weeks, the intensity on the ground is very different than if they're firing 2 million shells in six days

Speaker 1:          00:42:57       over a tiny area. One little wood on the battlefield, a thousand yards by 500 yards, took 80,000 shells in the first week. What does that look like? There's no human reference for this. I'm going to try to picture. I closed my eyes and I try to picture forests disappearing in front of my eyes. This is heavily wooded, forested, hilly terrain and burden. And right after the bombardment, you know, 24 hours, there's no forest laughed. I've watched forests belonged over weeks and months and it's still appalling to wake up and more forest is gone. What if you got to watch the entire thing churned up in front of you in a matter of hours, like a giant celestial weed whacker and chewing up grass. There are accounts that say that, you know, you'd have the shelling is so intensive to a giant tree, would get blown up in the air and before it lands on the ground again, another shell hits it and blows it right back up in the air. A veteran said that the battlefield quickly looked like an asparagus farm with giant shoots shooting up all over the soil everywhere, which are the tree stumps and wood everywhere. Needless to say to me, this is something I would have to have some sort of video have to imagine when I was a kid. I used to wonder what a tsunami looked like. And um,

Speaker 1:          00:44:11       now of course we have video of that. It was unimaginable when I was young. Now it's something anyone who wants to see it can go look up on youtube or something. That was a very rare sight and natural phenomenon or a manmade phenomenon for people to see. Shelling is the same way, and by the way, there's a lot fewer accounts than you might imagine of the first day shelling at the battle of Verdun and, um, that's an English. Then I'm sure there must be more German and French, but it's important to point out that there aren't a lot of people that probably survived the war in tact after those battles. And the ones who did were probably not all that excited to relive the experience. We do have some things though, even though it's 40 years old. Alister Horns, the price of glory has some of the best accounts in English of what it was like on the ground.

Speaker 1:          00:45:03       When the shelling started. He tells one story of a corporal who is with his buddies and they're just grinding some coffee. When the first shell start dropping, he writes, quote, suddenly the whole world seemed to disintegrate around him with the condition to Alacrity of old soldiers. The two men with the coffee grinder disappeared below ground, cursing and unprintable French. Why couldn't the bastards wait until I'd finished my coffee? The air in the way that little forested area, they are seemed solid with whirling material to Corporal Stephane. It was as if it were swept by a quote storm, a hurricane attempt tempest growing ever stronger where it was raining, nothing but paving stones and quote Horn continues, quote upon the terrible dean of the explosions were superimposed. The splintering crashes of rending would as the great 210 millimeter shells lopped off branches or uprooted the trees themselves, barely had the tree trunks fallen.

Speaker 1:          00:46:02       Then they were spewed up into the air again by fresh eruptions from his own position, still relatively immune to the shelling. Stephane watched it's methodical, progress with the certain macabre fascination. It was like a garden hose he thought and quote, and then he describes how the shells would move like a wave from one location to another, pounding everything in between and then methodically go back in the direction that just came from as though it's continually mowing the same piece of ground over and over again. It shows you what the plan had been before they started to make sure every inch of ground was covered. German aircraft are flying over the battlefield, having knocked the French air force out of the sky and are spotting for their guns and keeping the French planes from locating the German guns so the French guns could shoot at them. This leads to a very one sided initial encounter. Historian Polygon. Koski compares the initial bombardment here to the 1915 bottle of champagne, which at the time seemed momentously titanic. That was a year ago. Now, a year later, it seems like chump change compared to what the first day at Verdun is sort of priests aging. Jen Koski writes quote, it was partly because of such air cover, partly because it enjoys such free rein that morning that the German

Speaker 6:          00:47:30       shelling could exceed in intensity anything the French or anyone else had ever endured. This was the bottle of champagne multiplied 10 times over, but where the difference in kind as well, the German artillerist were blanketing entire zones with their shells. They directed their fire not merely onto positions they wished to take or onto lines they wish to obliterate, but into all that nature had grown and that man had erected as well, making up in density for what they lacked in precision that day. They saturated successive zones within a 25 mile arc between albacore on the left bank and attained on the right bank of the Muse with a million high explosive shells of the heaviest caliber known demand, 200 8,305, 380, even 420 millimeters wide and with lesser shells bearing toxic gases as well method rather than rage. The system of the power hammer rather than the obstinacy of the battering ram drove the destruction, the morbid calculus per se, aged the carpet bombing of later wars that would raise entire cities and ignite entire landscapes. But for now the thought was purely tactical to devastate so that the infantry could infiltrate

Speaker 1:          00:48:45       into quote. Now, as Jen Koski says, the difference in this artillery barrage is not just in the amount of stuff, but the way they do it. I mean, they're employing every little trick that they've learned in the last year, year and a half of warfare, including one that they probably think it was a clever enhancement. I'm sure the British and the French must have thought it. Another example of deviousness on the German part, but the Germans start this artillery barrage, you know, a little after seven in the morning and they pound these French positions all morning and into the lunchtime hour, and then they stop at midday. They stop on Cue all at once. Now even to the punch, drunk French survivors on the receiving end of the worst artillery barrage and human history. Know what this means. It always means the same thing. It means the German ground troops are coming in an offensive.

Speaker 1:          00:49:33       That's why you stopped shooting so that you don't blow your own men up. Now that they're on the way, right? So the French runup to their positions, they man, their defensive spots, they uncover any guns they've got hit and they get ready to push back the German assault. Now that it's coming, except that it isn't coming. It's a trick and all of a sudden all the guns opened up again and start smashing the now exposed French survivors who show those planes up in the air among other observers. Oh yeah. That guy's revived. Oh, there's a machine gun nest we didn't see. It was an intermission to get the French to expose themselves and this shelan goes for the rest of the day until the late afternoon, so from seven something in the morning to force something in the afternoon, and then the French survivors see the first signs of German infantry activity approaching what they see looks like something out of a time machine from the hitlarian Arab gone are the iconic pickle. How by the pointed helmets that the German troops were that hearkened back to the greatness of Prussia in Europe at the height of its 19th century, sort of colonial dominance. It's symbolic and it's been replaced with something that looks like a minor should wear it

Speaker 1:          00:50:49       thoroughly working class, nothing romantic, gentlemanly officer or a risk socratic about it. These tip of the spear troops here are wearing the German style helm, which with a minor modification or two is the exact same helmet the German troops will were in the Second World War. These storm troopers, as they're called and have been known to history, look like the Wehrmacht and they're carrying flame throwers among other nasty surprises for anyone. They might run into the gun machine guns with them. They got men who are wearing clothes that have big bags sort of as part of the where they can stuff hand grenades because you just can't carry enough hand grenades when you need them. They've even got in this, you know, shows you what they think. They're up against melee weapons with them. I mean they're famous. All these storm troop type units are famous for the clubs they carry or the hatchets or the long knives or even things like brass knuckles and stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:51:50       These are people who expect to get into physical combat at very close range. They are using what at the time seemed like very new fangled, very modern techniques on the battlefield. They're known as infiltration tactics. They pretty much are the same small unit tactics every military in the world uses today. They've been in development for a while too. It's a myth to suggest that the first time anybody sees them as with these storm troops, but these storm troops are the first to integrate everything into their system here. Not only are they going to use these infiltration tactics, but look at the weapons that they've armed themselves with and they've trained with all this. In other words, they've integrated all the various ideas and theories from all the militaries around the world for the last 15 years and are the first to put these troops out in the field whose job it is to look for weak spots and they call them the field and when they run into, you know, significant opposition, they stop or move around it in places where everyone's been killed by the artillery barrage they punched right through there. Their goal is to capture bait. Remember, this is a trap. The cheese in the trap has to be captured by the Germans before it can play the role of cheese. That's what this is all about. That is, if you believe, you know, the standard historical approach, this quite a few historians who believe this whole idea of let's create this meat grinder is bs propaganda at the time. And um, you know, mia culpa avoidance later on, right? If you believe that they're not trying to capture bait, they're trying to capture her done either way. The

Speaker 6:          00:53:26       point of this initial attack is to get the heights. The problem is the Germans find out to a degree exactly what the French and the British had found out the whole year before, which is that no matter how good the artillery barrage, there are just units that survive. And then when they strike back at you, it's amazing and the casualties mounted up unbelievably fast. On the very first day as the German troops pour into an area and begin to coalesce and sort of muster in us in a, in a specific area, French artillery opens up on them. And this is an account by a French staff officer with the artillery who first describes what the German artillery attack on his positions is like, and then describes responding in kind his was one of the few batteries that did by the way he writes, quote, thousands of projectiles are flying in all directions, some whistling, others howling, others moaning, low and all uniting into one infernal roar from time to time and Ariel torpedo passes, making a noise like a giant motor car with a tremendous thud, a giant shell bursts quite close to our observation post, breaking the telephone wire and interrupting all communication with our batteries.

Speaker 6:          00:54:43       A man gets out at once for repairs, crawling along his stomach through all this place of bursting minds and shells, it seems quite impossible. He writes that he should escape the rain of shells which exceeds anything imaginable. There has never been such a bombardment and war. Our man seems to be envelops and explosions and shelters himself from time to time in the shell craters which honeycomb the ground. Finally, he reaches a less stormy spot, men's his wires, and then as it would be madness to try to return, settles down in a big crater and waits for the storm to pass. Now he looks up and sees the German assaults. Approaching quote beyond in the valley, dark masses are moving over the snow covered ground. It is German infantry advancing impact formation along the valley to the attack. They look like a big gray carpet being unrolled over the country.

Speaker 6:          00:55:36       We telephone through to the batteries and the ball begins. The site is hellish in the distance in the valley and upon the slopes, regimens spread out and as they deploy, fresh troops come pouring in, there's a whistle over our heads. It's our first shell. It falls right in the middle of the enemy infantry. We telephone through telling our batteries of their hit and a delusion of heavy shells is poured on the enemy. Their physician becomes critical through glasses. We can see men, maddened men covered with earth and blood falling one upon the other. When the first wave of the assault is decimated, the ground is dotted with heaps of corpses, but the second wave is already pressing on once more. Our shells carve awful gaps in their ranks. Nevertheless, like an army of rats, the bushes continue to advance in

Speaker 1:          00:56:23       spite of our Mar Mites, a term the French use for their shells. He says, quote, than our heavy artillery burst forth. In theory, the whole valley is turned into a volcano and it's exit is stopped by the barrier of the slain and quote. That's a foretaste of what's to come right there. The Germans have to be on the offensive for a little while in this battle, a battle that is probably built upon the presumption that the defense has a huge advantage on the offense. This artillery was meant to make up for some of that, but the Germans are taking higher than expected losses from minute one. This is a problem too, because remember, regardless of which historical school you adhere to on the point of this battle, it was always part of the plan to lose as few people as possible. So the Germans are concerned with losses and part of the reason they're suffering so many is the French are resisting heroically on these first few days.

Speaker 1:          00:57:20       There are units that surrender, there are units that are just gone from the artillery barrage, but there are units including elite ones, but also rather pedestrian. One's sitting there and dying to the last man to delay this German advance. These infiltration troops are looking for places to push through. They find a couple, but they find a bunch with these decimated defenders resisting heroically to buy the country. Time to get fresh troops reinforcing that area to that area of Verdun is actually supplied on the French side by one little teeny road. The Germans had built multiple railway lines and their site to supply the battlefield. Right? So as French reinforcements are coming up, these heroic defenders are holding the Germans off as long as they can. There are more big bombardments that Germans push more troops in with more tenacity. On February 25th, the Germans in an almost Indiana Light Jones movie kind of drama capture the big fort in this region.

Speaker 1:          00:58:20       That's sort of overlooks the whole battlefield and we told you that the French high command kind of lost interest in force after the Germans and smashed the ones in Belgium and smash the early ones in France, but they still had people in them and there were still guns in them and slowly but surely they were starting to realize that sometimes and in some places they were worth having, didn't matter. These troops were in this fort, which is mostly below ground. When a German soldier gets blown into it somehow due to a shell exploding nearby, lands down on the ground, has a pistol with him and eventually will lead in some friends, but by and large is walking around this underground giant fort and as he opens doors into rooms, there's a couple of French soldiers playing cards or whatever and he captures them and locked them in a room and he does this over and over and over again. He finally has everybody Kinda captured. Nobody dies on either side and this major feature in the early part of the battle falls to the Germans. It's one of those situations that sort of rocks the French morale and they to fall apart. They've been through eight ton and now there's this crisis moment where all of a sudden it looks like the Germans are going to break through in the French are just going to fall apart before any reinforcements can stiffen the line. This is where things get really wiggy in this battle. By the way,

Speaker 1:          00:59:40       it gets right down to what the hell. The point of it is. If you're a falcon hein and the historians who think he's trying to create a meat grinder fall, that's true. You don't want to break through. You don't want Verdun. It's not really what you want. It's the cheese in your trap. If you take it, then you're just going to get counterattack and you're going to lose a lot of troops again and that then that's 19, 15 all over again. What did we do differently? Right?

Speaker 1:          01:00:07       If you're from the other school of thought though, the idea of breaking through to Verdun at this point is to nearly achieved what the whole battle was designed to do unexpectedly quickly. The crown prince who's commanding those armies really excited and there's all sorts of messages where they say, Oh, I will take it. I mean, didn't expect it this fast, but we'll take it and then they get within two miles of the city at one point and then the French put a new commander in charge. A guy who will be famous by the way in both world wars for different reasons. A guy named Pattan

Speaker 1:          01:00:39       and pitocin becomes, you know, it's so hard to, to separate the myth from the man when he, with his connection to Verdun. But the narrative is that baton gets in there and changes the French morale by himself. Practically. There's all these generals traveled with their own press corps. So there's going to be, this guy is going to have a bunch of people helping to, to pump up the myth, but he's famous for coming to the battlefield and you know, in these situations where the French just look desperate, you know, looking at troops and going, now we have them. We got them right where we want them. That kind of thing. And you know, maybe it's the 19th century mentality, but that seems to work. They famously says, or somebody says for him, and then he stands behind it. They shall not pass. And this becomes the big narrative of redundant.

Speaker 1:          01:01:25       It turns into like a French thermopylae, but the French aren't going to die to the last man. They're going to win in the end, right? It's again, part of this, this overriding narrative. Now, morale is kind of a hard to quantify as sort of thing, hard to measure, hard to look back in history and prove anything. You don't have to prove the real world terrafirma things that Bhutan did. Buttons and artillery guy, he's a defensive specialist and the first thing he does is bringing his own artillery and consolidate it and asked for more and slowly but surely begins to build up his own meat grinder for two can play at that game and Pitocin, start stocking up the French side with our chiller re to. And all this artillery turns this entire area into the moon. But weirder these shell holes in your head.

Speaker 6:          01:02:20       You think of something symmetrical like an immediate right crater. But it doesn't happen that way because you get these shell holes, which can be 30 feet deep with absolutely straight up and down edges, but then they get hit with another shell at some weird angle or an on an edge and then they get hit with another one and another one and another one, and it turns it into super weird formations. It still looks weird today. If you go look at modern pictures of the verdant battlefield, it looks totally alien and it creates a battlefield. There's a painting by a Frenchman Larue I think is his name, called hell, and it shows a couple of French soldiers in one of these craters and a dead body near them and they're wearing gas masks and the barrage is going on in giant timbers are part of this enormous crater and craters everywhere in the distance as far as you look.

Speaker 6:          01:03:08       We said this is like making war worse and these craters are the grossest thing you can imagine. I mean really just awful. They fill with water very quickly. Every one of them practically with a dead body or two in them, they fill with water. There's tons of trash, tons of stuff. I'm all kinds of. I mean they're mostly used as latrines. If it's close enough to where you can get to them. The water is fed ID and horrible and Greasy from the bloated bodies that float in it and interestingly enough poisonous because the gas that's used on these battlefields, I know it's tempting to think of it as vapor, but it's really almost a solid where when a gas shell explodes, it covers an entire area with like a pollen like coding and that pollen. Light coding is deadly, so it's like putting insecticide on a given area to keep you out of it for awhile and eventually the rain will come and dissolve that, but the dissolve runoff goes into all these shell holes that are filled with water and makes them just poisonous.

Speaker 6:          01:04:07       There will be a writer who will talk about how at first in in the spring, the Verdun battlefield, we'll try to recover a little of its life and they will see little green shoots pop up for a minute before the poisonous air and soil and water and everything just kills them right away. It's a giant burnt out insecticide zone. That's what Verdun is and and the, the landscape itself is horrifying to a degree that's hard to describe unless you want to say that this is more door. This is Jrr tolkien's conception of the dark land. I mean, he was in the first world war. Maybe he got it from there. The match is perfect though. I mean once they start to. Hillary has been going for not even that long at this levels of intensity you have around you on this battlefield and we talked about stage and all the people merely players will look at this stage. These people are playing on, you know, very shortly into the battle. It's a lunar landscape. It's the moon. Okay. And these trenches are places where people meet their end very often. I mean lots of stories about soldiers with big heavy packs in the night, losing their way, falling into one of these terrible craters and just

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       drowning. The worst stories are these people who you know, you hear stories by people drinking, kneeling down and drinking out of these green colored poisonous waters with bodies floating in it because the water isn't making it up to the front. The people whose job it is to bring food and water to the people on the front edge of the meat grinder are getting killed, trying to bring it up. This is a terrible battle. It's the battle of 1915 taken to the next level, which is what this war is going to be about. Every time the world thinks they've come to the limits of their endurance, surely this is the worst battle there will ever be. The standard gets up again and this happens continually. It's a pressure cooker. It's who's going to break first and you know you thought last year was bad. Welcome to next year and while next year is deadlier and while the scale is more and perhaps unsustainably titanic, the pattern is unfortunately for the troops on the ground horrifically familiar, about a week into the assault, the German attack at Verdun stalls.

Speaker 1:          01:06:25       Just like all these other battles we've seen in a lot more, we will see the initial assault is the most tense nail biting up in the air kind of time. Once it stopped, there may be ebbs and flows and scary moments, but by and large we have descended into what Churchill call did he say prolonged operations or extended operations. We're now into combat and for the troops on the ground, it's the most horrifying environment. When we want to study the idea of what human beings can do, it seems to me you want to see them in some of the most. If you want to see, just like a product test, did you want to put it under the most extreme stress and see how it behaves. Look at what Verdun becomes over the next many months. For the people on the ground who have to live this. How do they endure?

Speaker 1:          01:07:17       And when you hear the stories from this place, I mean start with the approach. March the French, as we've said, spend a lot of trouble to rotate their troops in and out of this battle because they get worn down like a pencil and a pencil sharpener, so you have to rotate them. When the soldiers approach Verdun, they can see it along way away. I mean the guns of the opening barrage were said to be audible a hundred miles away, so when they're approaching verdant, it looks like a giant forest fire in the distance. One French soldier on the way to it said that it reminded him of a gigantic forge that ceased neither day or night, and to quote it's the fires are more door, like I said, and then all of a sudden the air becomes smokey and hazy and you don't see the sun clearly anymore and all the vegetation disappears. One artist said the only color in the landscape after a while because it's just overturned dirt and bodies and and

Speaker 6:          01:08:16       churned up concrete. It's a hellish environment, but there is a smear of red here or there where the horses have just been splattered by artillery. Have I mentioned that? It sounds like hell yet. We mentioned earlier how hard it was to get food and water to the troops fighting at the front line, but it was hard to get anything to the troops fighting at the front line, for example, to get new troops to the front line could kill off half your troops in his book the price of glory. Alistair horn

Speaker 6:          01:08:48       takes a couple of different accounts and puts them together and quotes a few people who were there about what it was like simply trying to get to the front of the meat grinder at Verdun. Imagined suffering in a 40 or 50 percent casualties trying to get to the meat grinder. Here's what he writes. I'm quote, a mile or two from the front line. Troops entered the first communication trenches though to call them. This was generally both an exaggeration and an anachronism. Parapets gradually grew lower and lower until the trench became little deeper than a roadside ditch. Shells now began to fall with increasing regularity among closely packed men in the darkness. He says, for obvious reasons, approach marches were usually made at night. The columns trampled over, the howling wounded that lay under a foot. Suddenly the trench became nothing more than a track hardly traced out amid the shell holes in the mud, which the shelling had now turned to a consistency of sticky butter.

Speaker 6:          01:09:45       Troops stumbled and fell repeatedly cursing in low undertones as if fearful of being overheard by the enemy who relentlessly pursued them with uh, shells at every step. Sometimes there were duck boards around the lips of the huge shell craters, but more often there were not, and heavily laden men falling into the water. Filled holes remained there until they drowned, unable to crawl up the greasy sides. If a comrade pause to lend a hand, he writes, it often meant that too would drowned instead of one in the chaos of the battlefield. We're all reference points had long since been obliterated. Relieving detachments often got lost and wandered hopelessly all night, only to be massacred by an enemy. Machine gunner is dawn betrayed them. It was not unusual for reliefs to reach the front line with only half the numbers that set out, nor for this nightmare approach march to last 10 hours or longer. And quote seems to me, maybe I can speak for some of my generation if I just spent 10 hours struggling through that and lost half our people while doing so. Just so I got to take my turn on the front lines. I'm going to be severely

Speaker 6:          01:10:59       these stabilized, let's put it that way. Is that a good way to describe it?

Speaker 6:          01:11:04       And even though these French units will be rotated, maybe only spent five or six or seven days up at the front, I mean, that was designed to keep them from just being and being shattered. But judging from some of the witness accounts, uh, it didn't work very well. British historian John Keegan delayed John Keegan a rights that a French officer named Augustine coaching spent from the ninth to the 14th of April on one of these important hills and Keegan rights quoting this officer quote, the last two days soaked in icy mud under terrible bombardment without any shelter other than the narrowness of the trench. The Bosch did not attack naturally. It would have been too stupid result. I arrived there with 175 men. I returned with 34 several half mad, not replying anymore. When I spoke to them and quote, a French lieutenant described watching a unit, his own unit actually coming down and back from Verdun after being relieved and he says, quote first came the skeletons of companies occasionally led by a wounded officer leaning on a stick, all marched or rather advanced in small steps, zigzagging as if intoxicated.

Speaker 6:          01:12:20       It was hard to tell the color of their faces from that of their tunics. Mud had covered, everything dried off, and then another layer had been reapplied. They said nothing. They'd even lost the strength to complain. It seemed as if these mute faces were crying, something terrible, the unbelievable horror of their martyrdom. Some territorials who were standing near me became pensive. They had that air of sadness that comes over. One one, a funeral passes by and I overheard one say it's no longer an army. Those are corpses to have the territorials wept in silence like women and to quote, so what's going on to those guys that they go in one way and they come out so shattered and sometimes it only takes a couple of days to go from one reality to the other. That's where you know these firsthand accounts from these people are so moving.

Speaker 6:          01:13:16       First of all, from the perspective of these men on the ground, everything seems so pointless because they only know this little world of this big battlefield they're operating on and a perfect example is how you know these generals were now fighting over the same terrain, features over and over and over month after month after month. They take them and then they're retaken and then they take them again and they're all fighting over the same carnage, stained ground over and over again, and they develop names. I mean, one of these hills is hill three. Oh, four becomes a famous hill with a lot of people paying with their lives to take it and retake it again. There's another one known as the dead man or dead man's hills and other way to translate it. And that's another one of these hills. Um, I mean they've had the tops blasted all off them by both sides.

Speaker 6:          01:14:01       Artillery there smoking like volcanoes pretty much at all times. We're told sort of a dual mount doom if we want to keep our more door analogy going. And when a unit retakes a position on, for example, one of those long fought over terrain features, then you have that around you. I mean, for example, I'm in passing him has several quotes where he talks about soldiers having to retake this ground that are nothing more than sort of open cemeteries combined with butcher shops. And he writes, quote on the ground, soldier and writers, Jack Meyer describes the real rightfulness when he noted, quote everywhere there were distended bodies that your feet sank into the stench of death, hung over the jumble of decaying corpse is like some hellish perfume and quote, passing him continues quote, when the Germans captured hill three, oh, four in May, one of the first demands of the assault troops was for a double ration of tobacco to mask the overwhelming reek of corpses routing around them. Like Jacques Meyer, a fellow French soldier wrote at this time that quote, quoting this French soldier now, we all had on us the stench of dead bodies, the bread we ate, the stagnant water. We drank everything we touched how to rotten smell, owing to the fact that the earth around us was literally stuffed with corpses. And quote, how do you not lose your mind?

Speaker 6:          01:15:32       French barrel maker and Corporal Louis Bartos arrives at the famous hill three, oh four at one point in this bottle and looks up and contemplates this piece of ground that is cost. So many people on both sides there, earthly existence. He writes, quote, I looked out upon this famous nameless hill, our trench lay at the foot of it for several months. The hell had been disputed as if it had diamond mines on it slopes, alas, all it contained now with thousands of shredded pulverized corpses. Nothing distinguished it from neighboring hills. It seemed to have been partly wooded at one time, but no trace of vegetation remained. The convulsed overturned. Earth offered nothing but a spectacle of devastation and quote.

Speaker 6:          01:16:19       Now eventually in for reasons that we'll get into in a minute, the situation changes at for Don and the Germans go from essentially a sort of an offensive position to a defensive one as they transfer forces to another part of their front for something else that's going on, taking their attention and so the French use this as an opportunity to retake ground and now we get the same kind of battles we had when the Germans were moving forward in this. Now that the French are and now the Germans had taken a bunch of their artillery away. So now the French have the artillery dominance and now the Germans get to experience what the French experienced on the other side and you know, nine or 10 months into this battle, we have human beings living on the edge of what human beings can tolerate. There's an extended, a pair of quotes from the same guy, a German soldier who is in of these faults and these faults.

Speaker 6:          01:17:11       They're all over this area. This is a fortified zone. They have several Ford's covering one another and a lot of the most terrible battles happen over these forts and they're battered down so that they're just shells of what they were, but they could still hold hundreds of men and protect them from shrapnel. So oftentimes you had tons of men in these underground blown up forts with blood everywhere and everything else. And here's the way the environment is described by this German soldier quote. His name is private William Harmon's, by the way, of the 67th infantry regiment. And I get this from Peter Hart's book, the Great War. He said, quote, the entrance was a mere hole in the scarred battlefield and the silhouettes of cowering men constantly crawling into rod looked like huge ants in the dark. I descended an iron ladder some 40 feet into the concrete cavern.

Speaker 6:          01:17:58       It was an enormous place, crowded with many hundreds of soldiers. Some lay on bunk, sleeping, snoring and moaning, some cluttered the passages between the bunks, chatting or writing letters, other set or Nelton corners, packing or unpacking their belongings. Here, a flashlight there, a candle match your cigarette, dotted the dark with flickering islands of light continually shifting and brightness from this subterranean stronghold. A small patch of sky could be seen when one stood close to the iron ladder or look through the shaft which contained the ventilator fans occurrent of warm, stale air from 40 feet beneath, brought to my nostrils the sickening smell of first aid medications. Every one of the chicken wire births were filled with mutilated, muddy, torn, and befallen uniforms. A dismal site. There was a man with closed eyes, a blood soaked bandage around his head, another beside him lay twisting in pain.

Speaker 6:          01:18:52       I saw some lights written. Men who would scratch their bandages off to ease the itching. The passages between the bunks were crowded. There must have been a thousand men there, some had been relieved, but could not withdraw to the rear and some who had come to relieve the others could not proceed to the front lines. All were imprisoned deep within the concrete and rock entrails and the quote. Now, that's a scene that up until that point could have happened in a lot of wars. What happens next in that underground environment that that soldiers writing from is something that on a large scale between great powers only happened in this war. He says, quote, I heard the cry, poison gas, and I saw people around me putting on their gas masks. I adjusted mine, which still hung over my shoulder. There it was a yellowish gas glimmering near the iron ladder. A gas bomb must have been thrown into the entrance shaft. The CRI gas masks on electrified. The whole shelter soldiers ran to get their masks, which they had hung on the walls and in the corners or laid on their packs. Many who had lost their is on the battlefield, began to cough, the wounded in the bunks tried to climb into the upper births while beneath the gas crept forward along its way, extinguishing candle.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       After another, soon many were dying and the bunks and floors were filled with bodies over which the living stepped and stumbled in search of air. The alarm surge like away from bunk to bunk. Before long it had reached the farthest man 100 yards away. The panic was so great that I saw badly wounded men throw themselves onto the floor as though they wanted to drink in the gas while others tour the masks from their neighbors faces. Some had a reddish foam oozing from their mouths and quote. I always try to remind myself when we're talking about these big grand battles that what this really is is a million stories like that. The pain of that incident magnified over the entire scope of the war. And while I'm sure there's some people who are harder than I am in terms of, you know, saying that that's life and that's what history is filled with and all those kinds of things. It's hard not to sit there and feel a sense of all. I think for the people who faced this and not out of any sort of patriotic, you know, glorification of war or anything else, as I said, just sort of the unexpectedly strong limits of human endurance.

Speaker 1:          01:21:21       How did they sustain this effort? How did they, when told they had to advance into this or just not run away at top speed. How did they do it? And let's acknowledge that not all of them did. There were a lot of people shot in this war for running away, but the large majority of them did not. And you sit there and go, how did they not rebel? How did they not revolt? What would we do today?

Speaker 1:          01:21:49       There's a great quote from a f Scott Fitzgerald novel. It's fictional, but he puts words into the mouth of a man who showing one of these 1916 battlefields to his compatriots there touring the battlefield and he has a discussion with him and he tries to explain to them the almost soup that was required to bring up a generation of people who could do this. In other words, it's not just yours truly wondering how people sustain this effort. Even right after the war, people were trying to figure out how people could do this and here's the section from the f Scott Fitzgerald novel where Fitzgerald character explains it and he points in the distance to a little body of water and says, quote, see that little stream? We could walk to it in two minutes. It took the British a month to walk to it. A whole empire walking very slowly, dying in front and pushing forward behind and another empire walked very slowly backward, a few inches a day, leaving the dead like a million bloody rugs. No Europeans will ever do that again in this generation and the other character says, why? They've only just quit over in Turkey and in Morocco. The response quote, that's different,

Speaker 6:          01:23:10       this western front business couldn't be done again, not for a long time. The young men think they could do it, but they couldn't. They could fight the first modern again, but not this. This took religion and years of plenty and tremendous sureties and the exact relation that existed between the classes. The Russians and Italians weren't good on this front. You had to have a whole sold sentimental equipment going back further than you could remember. You had to remember Christmas and postcards of the crown prince and his fiance and little cafes and valance and beer gardens and entertain Linden and weddings at the Murray and going to the Derby and your grandfather's whiskers. General grant invented this kind of battle at Petersburg. In 65 came the reply, meaning general grant in the civil war in 18, 65, the main character says quote. No, he didn't. He just invented mass butchery. This kind of battle was invented by Lewis Carroll and Jules Verne and whoever wrote Ondine and country deacons bowling and Marianne's in Marsay and girls seduced in the back lanes of Wittenberg and Westphalia. Why?

Speaker 1:          01:24:20       This was a love battle. There was a century of middleclass love spent here and quote a century of middle class love spent here that is profound and that's how the generation that lived through this war side, so basically fitzgerald answer to that question of, you know, how did these people endure is that you had to have grown up the way they did with the same cultural influences and expectations, including societal and class based ones either had to have seen the world the way they did, had similar concepts of, you know, duty and expectations and even manhood and you'd have to have in some ways the same illusions to because in certain circumstances having illusions could help you carry out military operations that people who were more cynical and realistic would never do. And you know, when you think about the endurance to. I mean it's so normal to focus on the horrific war side of this.

Speaker 1:          01:25:28       But the simple life part of this is sometimes what pushes people over the edge. You know, you'll hear stories sometimes were they will say, well, they were able to adapt to the shelling. They just couldn't handle the rats or something. Something gets to them sometimes above and beyond what you might think. I mean, a perfect example is start looking at what day to day life was like for these people who any of us would think we're focused on staying alive, but sometimes it got down to even more base level than that. Louis Bartos fighting in the Verdun inferno writes about at night being in one of trenches. When the rain

Speaker 6:          01:26:04       just comes pouring down, he says, quote, we were crouching down so it's not to catch a stray bullet or shell fragment passing by, and if this weren't bad enough, a heavy rain started to fall. It didn't take long for the water to fill in the ditch and to submerge our shoes. Our helmets were transformed into drain spouts. Little waterfalls ran down our packs onto our hips, off our shoulders and along our arms. We didn't know what or whom we were waiting for. The night was pitch black where they just going to leave us stuck in the sewer

Speaker 7:          01:26:34       and quote.

Speaker 6:          01:26:36       Sewer is such an apt name too, besides the bodies and the poison and the decay and the lice and the rats have not even dealt with them. They're both absolutely beyond imagination. Living with the lions, living with the rats. You also have the problems of men fighting in an inferno. We're getting out of your trench meant a pretty good chance of dying when you have to go to the bathroom. Louis parked us writes quote, and to make it worse, as I've already described, all of us, one after the other, suffered from an epidemic of intestinal disorders. The resulting diarrhea sure cleaned us out, but in opportunity, as soon as one of us got over at his next door, neighbor was afflicted with it and had the bad luck to have to climb out of the trench and head for the shell hole which served as our latrine. Of course, we did this only in the last resort at the last moment of agony, stretching our guts until they were about to burst. One of us was surprised in the latrine by one of these sudden fusel aids and collapsed into his own excrement. So as not to expose oneself to similar incidents, some used sardine or monkey meat cans as chamber pots, so it was not to have to leave. One's hold in the ground, won't even sacrificed his cast iron dinner plate

Speaker 7:          01:27:48       end quote. How do you keep your sanity?

Speaker 6:          01:27:52       You have to risk your life to I'm in the whole thing again. Ellen, in Lincolnshire Battlefield, there might've been one horrible day where if you're unlucky enough to have dysentery that day, it's a horrible day in the ranks. It isn't a day after day after day thing. These people are putting up with a pounding on their psyche, but understanding what they went through is in large part what makes this story so incredibly compelling. The extremes of human experience, right? I talk about it all the time. There's a wonderful paragraph by historian Eric Dorn, Bros who tries to describe why this isn't gratuitous to talk about this, why it's part of being astounded by your ancestors.

Speaker 7:          01:28:37       Here's what

Speaker 6:          01:28:37       Bros says,

Speaker 7:          01:28:39       quote,

Speaker 6:          01:28:40       most historians today depart from the traditional practice of omitting casualty figures. What was once left out for respect of the dead and to avoid any indecent hint of criticizing or questioning the sacrifices they made is now included in order to eliminate the magnitude of the horror men faced by citing numbers. In other words, historians the process of turning back towards describing what war was really like, and they do this despite the understandable loading of the veterans themselves to remember or speak about traumatic experiences they have tried usually unsuccessfully to suppress the problems historians encounter with casualty figures. However, especially the astronomical numbers of dead and wounded in 20th century wars is that numbers have a numbing quality to them. Although shocking to read initially, they quickly lose descriptive effectiveness as mines fail to grasp horror in the abstract, in order to do historical justice to combat on the ground.

Speaker 6:          01:29:38       Therefore, it is necessary to go beyond the numbers to the gruesome eyewitness accounts, shaking off criticism that to go there is gratuitous. The Great War can only be fully understood if all its aspects are exposed. Dimensions of the front experience that not only affected soldiers' morale and eventually the outcome of the war, but also home fronts and they are critically important to willingness to continue shouldering the war effort. All wars are horrible. Bros writes tragedies for the dead, their relatives and friends hobbling, sometimes disfiguring injuries for others, turning wives, children and parents and the caregivers for life and psychological mind fields for veterans who may have escaped death and injury, but not the terrible memories with which loved ones too are then forced to live. The Great War was especially helacious. However, because it was the first to unleash the full mechanized fury of sophisticated industrial technology and quote, men had never been asked to endure anything quite like this. Some of these French soldiers had to go back to verdun more than one time. What does that do to you? I read somewhere where one of them said the first time you can kind of handle because you don't know what you're in for. It's particularly hard when you're going back to more door after you've been to more door, so happy to have survived and now you get to take your chances all over again,

Speaker 6:          01:31:04       so the majority of the French army gets a chance to rotate through this area at least once and they never get over. It. Pattan himself will say about the Verdun experienced to the French army quote, the constant visions of death had penetrated the French soldier with a resignation that bordered on fatalism and quote, the fighting wind end for 10 months. About half that time the Germans were on the attack. The other half the time the French were on the attack and by the time it was over, this is disputed, but about a million total casualties. Both sides added up together, give or take 200,000. Either way at the end of the war, it will be mandated in the treaty that win. This battle field is cleared and it will take decades just to get the bodies off of it. The shells are still there and many of these areas are cordoned off until, well, probably

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       a good 100, 200 years from now. I'm the treaty stipulated that when French bodies were dug up and buried, they needed to be buried singularly and with white crosses for purity. The Germans didn't have to be in a single grave and their graves were to carry black crosses signifying shame. The depth of emotion that Verdun created in the immediate post war generation, but even in France today is unlike quite any other military endevor French arms have participated in

Speaker 1:          01:32:39       and the mythmaking about this crazy battle starts before the fighting's even done and there's a whole group of revisionist historians who've been trying ever since the battle happened to poke holes in the myths that obscure the reality of her done. It's got such a sacred hold on both France and Germany. It's hard to separate the facts from the fiction and there's a huge amount of heroism and sacrifice connected to this event. It's understandable that you would get, you know, some mythmaking and the revisionist historians often portray Falcon high and the German commander. And the one behind this plan as an idiot, it was dumb plan executed in competently and after the war, when people went to Falcon, heightened said, what were you thinking there? He said, oh, I was trying to kill a lot of people. That was my goal. Mission accomplished a lot of these revisionist historians.

Speaker 1:          01:33:30       I'm Paul Koski is a perfect example. We'll say something like, to make verdun out to be any worse than any number of terrible world war one. Battles is to play into the myth. I mean, he says, if, if being in a trench with the rain falling on you with your feet up to your knees in mud under shell fire and sniper fire day after day is terrible. While there's plenty of first world war battles where as a soldier you would have found yourself in that situation with bodies all around. I mean that's not that abnormal in the first world war. And they're right about that too. But you know, maybe it's fairer to say that there are several really unbelievably horrible and unprecedented battles in the first world war that are equally hellacious. And you would not want to be at any of them. They each have their own awful unique flavor to them that makes them different and nothing smells quite like for done.

Speaker 1:          01:34:19       And if you said to me, you have to be at one of these horrible battlefields for Dunn is the lowest on my list for Dunn is the last place out of all of them that I want to be. If you ask what Verdun achieved, again, there's a wide variety of opinions on this. The most popular is that it achieved nothing. One of the broad symbols of the general wastefulness of this war, about a million people either are killed or wounded or you know, have never returned from that battlefield and nothing of huge importance. It was gained because of that one thing that certainly did happen as it moved up the timetable for several other battles that we're going to happen a little bit later. But when the French got pressed by the Germans have ridden, they said the British and they send to the Russians.

Speaker 1:          01:35:08       You know those battles you were planning on starting. Could you move up the timetable and start them sooner? We could use the help over here and finally, the one thing in 1916 you're beginning to see, and we've alluded to this before, is that these people have put up already with a lot more pounding than we would probably put up with today, but there's a breaking point for all human beings in my mind. The breaking point that's coming was quickened by the experience at Verdun and we'd mentioned that the French had a policy of rotating troops during the battle to keep them fresh at Verdun, but what that meant was virtually the entire French army at one time or another, was rotated through that sector for done, took the French and ratcheted up the discontent levels in ways that were probably out of proportion to what you could have expected from a more normal battle.

Speaker 1:          01:36:05       It got you closer to the breaking point. The idea of pushing your adversary to the point where their society literally implodes is a thoroughly modern idea. By 1916, most of the military leaders in this conflict see that as the end game in this conflict. The reason it's a thoroughly modern concept isn't because people of the past didn't understand it. It was because they could never take enough damage to get to that point. As we've said throughout this series, nations in the past, for the most part, couldn't take a punch. The ones who could stand out like sore thumbs. The Roman republic, for example, what makes it so unusual in the military history sense, they could sustain defeat after defeat after defeat and not capitulate. They could lose a battle of Kony. They could lose a battle of Lake [inaudible] in the same war and keep coming back for more theory.

Speaker 1:          01:37:05       Unusual. You know, a generation before those defeats. Alexander the great defeats, the massive and the greatest empire the world has ever seen. The Acumen did Persian empire with a couple of big shots. There's never enough time for the society to implode. A society collapsing at the foundation's requires that they be able to stand there and exchange enough punches to get to that point. By 1916, the grinding down of nations as well underway as author David Fromkin says the real war had become an economic and social survival contest, and the generals are beginning to organize their strategies to quicken and hasten this outcome. For example, when Falcon high and talks about you know the idea using attrition

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       to bleed the French White, he explains that you don't have to worry about the Russians anymore because they're well on their way to having their entire society collapsed. He says, quote, according to all reports, the domestic difficulties of the giant empire are multiplying rapidly. Even if we cannot perhaps expect a revolution in the grand style, we're entitled to believe that Russia is internal troubles will compel her to get in within a relatively short period. In this connection, it may be taken for granted that she will not revive her military reputation. Meanwhile, we need not be anxious about that. On the contrary, it is probable he writes that any such attempt and the loss is it must involve, will only hasten the process of disintegration and quote. I should also point out that in the 19th century, for example, that kind of disintegration not only wasn't the goal, it would have been seen as a negative byproduct in the era where a military defeat meant that one general gave his sword to the other general and we exchanged some provinces are some colonies or whatnot. The goal wasn't for the society to collapse. It was now

Speaker 1:          01:39:11       and military leaders began to employ strategies designed to make that outcome a reality. For example, when the war starts, the British used their navy to clamp down a blockade on Germany. Now the French don't look at that as a very useful strategy because after all, something like that's going to take a long time and no one win. This war starts or you know, a very small minority who turned out to be Cassandra's and prophetic. No one thinks the war is going to go long enough for something like a blockade to actually take effect. But by 1916, everyone is starting to understand that those longterm anaconda like strangling strategies are very viable and the British are not the only ones who can do this. After all, the Germans have a fleet to right, and this is the point in the story where it becomes worth talking about again for a minute.

Speaker 1:          01:40:10       You see, this German fleet was a key reason. The tensions, especially with Brittany, increased in the prewar years, right? It's called the Anglo German naval tensions, but it was considered to be worth it by a kaiser and a government that thought it was important to be able to hold your own at sea. So these ships were built and they cost an amazing amount of money. A huge amount of industrial capacity is sucked up into this. As we said, [inaudible]. You turn up at a basically friendly Britain into an enemy and now that you got what you wanted, it's sitting in port continually and here you've got your country straining every fiber you know, to sacrifice for the war effort. Heck, the civilians are starting to cut back on their caloric intake and here's this fleet, so expensive to build and every month sucking up resources and sitting in port. This is the time in the story where because the Germans get a new admiral, things start to happen on the surface naval front for really the only time in this war.

Speaker 1:          01:41:14       And if you are our nut for this period like I am, I like to call it the battleship era, somewhere between 1890 ish in 1940 ish about 50 years. The era where you get these armored Lavania fans that are just, to me, they're fascinating, right? And they're such incredible vehicles that you may have to fast forward this show when I start going off on some detailed tangent that, you know, only I find interesting. Um, but I, I think these vehicles are incredible and there is so little evidence of them actually being used that on the few occasions where it happens, I tend to look at them rather deeply. There's only one occasion in history. I don't think I count the Rusa Japanese war pre dread. I think only one occasion in history where these armored ships from this era, the 50 years battleship era, actually fought the way these admirals had envisioned they would in long lines, miles long lines, stretching off to the horizon, you know, Lord Nelson Style pirates of the Caribbean style and facing a fleet.

Speaker 1:          01:42:16       Similarly arrayed and shooting, you know, in the distance between them. That only happened once in this whole 50 year battleship era and only happened once in this war. Obviously it's a battle in 1916 called the battle of Jutland to Kooks like yours. Truly. This is a fantastically interesting encounter. When we were thinking about organizing this story, you know, you, you try to carve out places to take a little direction, change in a momentum change. You know, you go from the carnage of ridden and those of you who know the story know what's coming up in the future of it and you take a little interlude to talk about other elements. Not just the naval side of this, but also the fact that the navy really is a wonderful canvas on which to represent the technology of this era. And how big of a deal that is to the people here and that's a perpetual problem, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          01:43:04       Me going back in time and seeing what looks to be ancient technology to US looking at it the way the people back then are looking at it, to whom it's cutting edge stuff. I mean, first of all, I was trying to think about the best way to sort of explain, create an analogy for how these people see the fleets they have and the fleets and the navy's along with this new thing. These aircraft are the real cutting edge technology out there. And the reason why is because it's just death to be too far behind. And as I said, the best navy from 1900 would lose to several navies from 1914. That's a mere 14 years. I don't think those 1914 navy's lose a ship. That's how quickly things are changing. Robert Massey and his book dreadnought has a great line where he says in 1900, and that's a mere 14 years before the first world war breaks out. Every single British admiral commanding a British battleship had been trained when they came up in the navy and the age of sail.

Speaker 1:          01:44:04       So that's an example of how cutting edge this is. Um, if you want a mental image, think of the titanic, the ship that struck the iceberg and went down and everything that's from this era. It's sort of a steam, punky Sherlock Holmes. He kind of feel. I always think about it as. I mean if you, if you are up in the command center, one of these battleships, it's like star trek meets Sherlock Holmes or steam punk and you, instead of having a digital display, you'd have one of those in around dials with one of those arrows that looks like the elevator Arrow in a nice New York hotel that goes around on a gold background. I mean, you know, very, very beautiful. Actually. These ships were beautiful, polished wood, the whole thing. They were just gorgeous and they were the cutting edge technology of their day. And I had to resist comparing them to space ships as a way to try to have us feel like the people back then felt. Because you know me, that would just be so meta, so it's just like a star ship, but it's a little like one but not enough for the comparison. Right. As I thought to myself, I thought, you know, those people saw battleships, uh, as, as really cutting edge, but not as much as we would spaceships with an equal number of crew members on board. That would be a bigger deal. But then I remembered the submarines

Speaker 1:          01:45:19       for the people, again, hard for us to get all wild about them, but to the people back then, that is science fiction, the very definition of the word right out of Jules Verne's, 20,000 leagues under the sea and all of a sudden we have ships that go underwater. It's like they have cloaking devices. They become invisible and worse, if you're a naval official back then is that they now carry new weapons that threatened everything you have. This is what really accounts for the cautious nature of naval warfare in this period, right? Why didn't the ships just all come out blazing and everything while there's all these uncertainties? Part of this period's attraction is that you begin to see a show down in naval warfare when you haven't had any test of any of this technology to long time. No one knows what's going to happen when you get whole fleets out here blazing away with this modern technology. It hasn't happened before. One of the things everyone's kind of scared about is you know these torpedoes for example, and these minds, you know these floating minds that that lay in the water and then a ship runs into them and boom, they explode because these weapons are very, very cheap, right? You can make a lot of them and they can sync these massively expensive, you know, ships that take years to build and who's lost as catastrophic. They can sync those.

Speaker 1:          01:46:43       That's a huge change because in most naval warfare, generally there are exceptions, but when you want to sync a expensive first class ship, you generally need either another massive firstclass ship or a lot of other ones. They have huge survival strength, right? They, they can justify their cost and the investment. Now all of a sudden, for example, Churchill talks about the British admiralty, just being petrified that you would turn around one day and these great, huge expensive ships that took forever to build and that you only had a limited number of were just disappearing in the blink of an eye boom, quick explosion, another ship gone, and then when the war starts in like the first couple of months that happens, they lose a super dreadnought. The Creme de la creme of the British battleship forces or the HMS audacious strikes a mine like, you know, a month or two after the war starts and that's a, that's a pretty brand new ship almost.

Speaker 1:          01:47:36       And Boom, goes down. One mine, one battleship. Wow. Again, if you're in the admiralty, you're going, okay, what does this mean? And then a submarine like sinks, a couple of old British cruisers, boom, boom, boom. I mean one right after another, and now all of a sudden you know, these people who've got these big expensive ships are petrified about using them in military history as like Martin van [inaudible] have spoken about this. We just have this strange dichotomy where you spend so much money on these vessels because they are very important, but they, because you spend so much money on them, you don't want to reach them. And so you have the German navy in the British navy dealing with each other as maybe two snipers hunting each other would deal with each other, waiting for the other side to make a mistake. And then when they do pouncing, the problem is, is that when the war starts, the British clamp down that blockade and that's all they need to do.

Speaker 1:          01:48:30       The pressures on the Germans to do something about it. And as we said, Winston Churchill, who was the civilian, uh, head of the navy for awhile in this conflict wrote down that really, while there would've been a lot of advantages to sending the, you know, numerically superior British fleet to go in there and just kick German tail. The downside if you failed to do that was so bad it wasn't worth it. He said, yeah, you know, we could get all these good things if we decisively defeated the German. But he goes, but if we lost, and remember this is all untried technology and naval combat, it's weird and unpredictable. Anyway, you could bring the superior fleet in there and somehow lose or just lose enough so that you don't have the numerical advantage anymore. You've got parody with the enemy and that was unthinkable, and Churchill said the chances of that happening might not be great, but if it happens, it could cost us the whole war.

Speaker 1:          01:49:22       I remember reading that and thinking to myself, I don't know if I buy it, but a whole lot of interesting thoughts come to mind if you believe what Churchill says about it. Basically having the potential to end the war. Now, here's how he explained it in his book, he said, if the German navy were even to have a nice victory against the British and cut down the numerical superiority so that they both have the same number of big ships than the German navy would be to interdict the stuff heading for Britain. And Churchill says that that would result in quote, the trade and food supply of the British isles would have been paralyzed. Our armies on the continent would have been cut off from their base by superior naval force. All the transportation of the allies would have been jeopardized and hampered. The United States could not have intervened in the war.

Speaker 1:          01:50:09       Starvation and invasion would have descended upon the British. People ruin under and final would have overwhelmed the allied cause. He says the great disparity of the results at stake in a battle between the British and German navy's can never be excluded from our thoughts. And so if you buy Churchill's theory, that means instead of being the most secure of the great powers that I think most of us assume Britain is, after all, you're talking about an island nation to country with a moat around it, right? And then you add the greatest navy in the world. Looks pretty secure to me, but Churchill's idea here is that, yeah, but we're one lucky punch away from that situation. Changing to stay with our boxing analogy, and if that's true, the Germans maybe are justified in keeping that fleet safe and port in case you need a lucky punch.

Speaker 1:          01:50:59       Maybe you're losing the war elsewhere and you decide you'll send your ships on a death run and take your chances. Maybe you get lucky, right? Maybe you get a knockout blow. If again, you buy into what Churchill saying, it means that the Germans will, as long as they still have a fleet somewhere, maintain the ability to win the war with a lucky punch at anytime. I find that fascinating. Don't know if I believe it, but find it fascinating. Now, the only time in this war that the attempt at a lucky punch happens. It wasn't thrown that way, but the only time that this decisive encounter that could be potentially horrifying if it totally went the wrong way for Britain. The only time this happens is in this part of the story. We're in now, 1916, and it happens because of that album we mentioned earlier.

Speaker 1:          01:51:46       His name is Ryan Hart Shear and he takes over in early 1916 and he feels about the German fleet pretty much the same way everyone else does. It's time to earn your keep and let's start acting more aggressively with it. And so he'll start trying to, um, the best way to put it as trap the British, the British have more big ships than the German. So sheers ideas. Well, let's see if we can ambush small numbers of those big ships, overwhelmed them and slowly but surely widdled down the advantage in numbers that the British have and it's one of these attempted traps that results in this really only time for enthusiasts like yours truly, to see what these fleets could do in an all out encounter with both sides, hurling steel at the horizon and with all these weapons that, you know, from a spectator standpoint, you're just dying to see what the heck they can do.

Speaker 1:          01:52:41       I mean, let's start with the guns. The guns on these ships, the same kind of guns you saw leveling the Belgian fortune that the Germans were using it for. Done. Those are the big naval guns being used on land. Well, why do you think they call them naval guns? Right? These new battleships, I mean for example, the British are bringing in four or five brand new ones that will fight in the Second World War Two that have 15 inch guns and multiple, I mean like eight to 1215 inch guns. That's incredible. 13 inches of armor. They were like 30,000 tons. The new Queen Elizabeth Class, they're called. They can do like 25 knots if they're really smoking. These are incredible, incredible modern warships and when you realize that they can hurl a shell the size of a small Volkswagen, 18 miles across the horizon at a target that's a hundred feet wide while both shooter and target are moving and hope to hit it reasonably well.

Speaker 1:          01:53:43       That's shocking. I mean the Spanish American war, uh, less than 20 years before this time period, they would fire hundreds of shots at about just less than three miles distance. And every now and then they'd score a hit, you know, hundreds to get a few in the Russo, Japanese war, they broke all records when they opened fire at each other at eight miles distance. That's 11 years before the battle of Jutland. Eight miles breaking all records. The Battle of Jutland has ships that can fire 18 miles. How do you even hit anything on the horizon? Well, both sides, British and German are incorporating, again, it's like steam punk technology, maybe a rudimentary fire control computer you might call it and both sides have different versions and the Germans have superior optics and so they'll score the early hits in, in, in, in this encounter that happens in large part because the British are reading the naval communications of the Germans.

Speaker 1:          01:54:40       See, I love the battle of Jutland for a couple of reasons, not just because it's the battleship encounter of the war, but also because it's a rubber meets the road moment a put up or shut up historical acid test where all of the military theories and the debates and the, the philosophical differences amongst experts over the proper way to build these ships and what naval battles going to be like in the next war and all that stuff leaves the realm of the theoretical and gets, you know, laboratory tested on the naval battlefield. The land powers already saw this happen to them right at the start of the war, their military land theories and all that the people had speculated about for decades, got their acid test in the first month. Places like the battles of the frontiers where those sort of high minded all academic debates at military war colleges about whether or not charging cavalry will have any sort of a role on the modern battlefield with machine guns and everything.

Speaker 1:          01:55:37       I mean that kind of stuff gets tested in the first month of the war and the results are of course bloody and decisive. Even if they won't be absorbed right away. The naval side of this war hasn't had this kind of an acid test yet. There've been little encounters, one of the Falkland Islands and other one dog or bank between a few cruisers here in a battle cruiser to there, but nothing like what's going to happen at Jutland. And when you realize how careful these admirals are being because of the nature of naval combat, I mean you could provide an opportunity for someone to get a lucky punch if you're not careful. So none of these admirals wants to go out, unless they have an edge, unless they have an advantage on their side, favorable conditions, it would be called the British don't have to do anything because they've got this blockade going. So worst case scenario, if things just stay as they are, they are wearing the Germans down with this blockade.

Speaker 1:          01:56:26       They're going to create the disintegration of a state just like we told you, you know, was the goal. Now of these leaders, you know, if the Germans begin to starve at home and the caloric intake is already being reduced for their civilians, you will see revolution in the streets. So this British strategy of blockade will eventually bring Germany to its knees. So it's incumbent upon the Germans to do something about that situation when they get their new admiral Reinhardt's shear in 1916 who wants to be more aggressive? He decides to create his own edge, you know, the conditions for his own advantage on the naval battlefield. So he sets traps and in late May 1916, he sets one for what he hopes will be a detachment of big British warships. You know, get five or six battle cruisers and entice them pastures, submarines or into your mind fields or into an area where they think they can feast on some of your light forces and then pounce on them with your big fleet and that's what she plans to do.

Speaker 1:          01:57:27       And so he sets out all these forces and prepares this little ambush and what he doesn't know is that the British, as we said, our reading, all these naval communications, are the British the greatest cryptographers on the planet or is that just the 20th century? Sort of coloring my view because boy, were they great in the 20th century, in the Second World War. They will famously be reading all the German enigma traffic among other things in this war and the first couple of months the German naval codes fall into their hands and while they may not be deciphering every single message when the entire German high seas fleet as it's called 100 ships about decides to way anchor and go out. You know, looking to play in the North Sea. The British know about that. There'll be big communication spikes and everything. So when sheer decides to set this ambush, the British reading the naval codes tell the fleet, guess what?

Speaker 1:          01:58:19       The Germans are out there and they don't know that we know they're out there. And so the British grand fleet, thanks. Okay, now we have the advantage. We will trap the trappers. And so the British Grand Fleet, which is like 28, you know, super dreadnoughts and dreadnoughts. I mean it's the biggest fleet in the world. It's the most powerful fleet in world history up to this point. And in terms of size and tonnage, it may be the biggest fleet ever. It weighs anchor. It starts making its way to where this ambush point is and it leaves so early by the way, because it's got all this advanced information that it totally screws up a lot of ab role sheers ambush because his forces, you know, he had these submarines that were going to be outside the British ports and that they could shoot it. The British ships, as they left the harbor, none of that stuff's ready.

Speaker 1:          01:59:07       And so the British ships make their way to the rendezvous point where with the Germans. And you're setting up another trafalgar here. I mean, if the British fleet emerges into view and catches the German fleet there, you could sink half of it before they get away. And then Murphy's law joins the battle. Murphy's law takes center stage in this encounter, by the way, which would have made a great dress rehearsal for early 20th century naval warfare. Unfortunately, it's opening night and you know you have troubles on opening night with all of the loose ends that haven't been fixed yet. Imagine instead of opening night, you're doing the dress rehearsal and yet you have 250 ships in about 15 square miles. When these things come together, I mean the things that can go wrong and do go wrong, effect this battle mightily. And it's a good argument for why these admirals are so cautious. They know this.

Speaker 1:          02:00:02       So Murphy's law intervenes while the British are about to pounce on the Germans because the British send a message back to their intelligence service wanting a confirmation of this or that. And the intelligence people reading the German naval codes tell them that they made a mistake earlier. They said, Oh yeah, the German fleets not at sea like we thought there's still safely important, don't worry about it. So now these admirals, who five minutes ago knew where the German fleet was and we're ready to pounce on it, don't know they're there anymore, but of course they are. And so now we have both main fleets close to each other in the North Sea. None of them aware of the other's existence. So the rhythm of this battle of Jutland is wonderful, starts off as a trap, flips into a counter trap, and now it is serendipitously morphed into an encounter battle and that's how it gets started. German light forces on one side of the horizon. British light forces on the other side of horizon spot, a civilian trawler between the two of them. They can't see each other because they're so far away. The curvature of the earth limits their site, but they can both see the trawler. So these light units, you know, converge on the trawler to investigate it, discovery each other's, starts shooting and send messages back to the main fleet saying, guess what I have found over here on the other side of the horizon, the enemy fleet, right?

Speaker 1:          02:01:26       And so this creates like a war vortex where all these naval forces start converging on this area. The ships that arrive first are the battlecruisers. This is an side of the story because the battle cruisers are experiencing a test right now and it's the test of whether or not the admirals that backed this entire design in the decades before this period were correct about it. This is a theoretical argument until there's data, there hasn't been a chance to have any data. Now we're going to have data. Are these ships viable? Now, first of all, you need to know what they are. A battle cruiser is a hybrid design. It's supposed to combine the punching power of a battleship with the speed of a cruiser. So if a battleship is like some giant lion, for example, or tiger, these battle cruisers are more like panthers. Now this is going to be confusing because they are all named after like giant cats, and so the flagship of this battle cruiser squadron on the British side is the lion.

Speaker 1:          02:02:34       So don't get confused if I start talking about the lion. Um, but that describes it pretty well. The hypothetical problem here though, is that you had to give up to get the speed of a cruiser. You had to give up the armor of the battleship. So what we have here is a ship with all the striking power of a battleship, but one that can't take a punch by a battleship or its counterparts. Another battle cruiser. When this was pointed out before the war, the admirals who liked the battle cruiser concept waved off this worry by saying don't worry, speed will be their armor. And that's where the argument is because nobody knows if speed will be their armor. These battlecruisers approach, this battle at 26 or 27 knots, which is amazingly fast for a ship their size, there are six of them on the British side and five of them on the German side.

Speaker 1:          02:03:30       And when they meet, they begin to open fire and only about like eight miles, which is short. And the British have the longer range guns by the way. But don't open fire first. This becomes the first of many things that the British admiral of these battlecruisers, a guy named beatty will be critiqued about. You know, after this battle, the battle opens up at about 3:45 in the afternoon. Visually it is hard to see the ships if you actually see a picture of them at full tilt are smoking like they're on fire. And when you have a bunch of them, they're putting tons of this dark suit into the air. Add to that, the fact that we're over by Denmark in the North Sea, there's fog there, squalls, there's missed, there's rain, there's all kinds of things that inhibit the ability to see very well. And sometimes one fleet will be in a position where they see the other fleet really well, but the other fleet doesn't see them and vice versa.

Speaker 1:          02:04:30       So the part of being a good Amaryllis, trying to arrange your fleet so that the other fleet is highlighted against the horizon or in some way makes them an easier target and your fleet is kind of obscured and hard to hit, but ships had not tried to shoot at each other and some of the ranges they're going to try to shoot at each other. Here. When these battle cruisers start shooting at about 3:45, the British shoot long, initially over the heads of the German ships, the German ships are disconcertingly accurate. They strike the battle cruiser Tiger like six times in quick succession with 11 inch shells.

Speaker 1:          02:05:08       Then at 4:00 they strike the flagship, the lion with Admiral Beatty on board. The shells penetrate the Turret, which is the sort of armored bubble that that contains the big guns. The touristy either explodes or catches on fire and there are photographs, by the way, have moments in the battle of Jutland. They're not great and I always imagine them zoomed in and colorized, but you can see the lion burning and it looks bad and admiral beatty didn't realize at the time how closely he came to being blown to kingdom come. They'll find out later that a guy who was dying and who had lost both his legs, I'm on the lion, saved the ship by flooding the magazine. The last order he gave was to to flood the whole area where the explosives or to keep them from blowing the ship up. Now, if beatty was wondering what it would be like to see one of these modern amazing ships explode, he only had to wait about two minutes. If you actually look at the moment by moment rundown of this battle, and that's part of the fun of naval battles. All these ships kept a very descriptive and detailed logs about their movements moment by moment by moment. They've reconstructed this entire battle from almost each individual ships viewpoint and the part that strikes you when you read a rundown is how quickly everything is happening. So beatty suffers. This hit on his own target at like 4:00, two minutes later, the HMS indefensible, a somewhere in the 20,000 tons of battle cruiser explodes,

Speaker 1:          02:06:47       just explodes in a moment. It's Churchill in the admiralty is nightmare come true. I mean in a blink of an eye, you have a towering cloud reaching up like 1500 feet. Witnesses say you could see, you know, funnels and guns and everything shooting up into the horizon and both sides. German and British watched this happen together

Speaker 1:          02:07:12       out of the more than 1000 sailors on board the indivisible to survive. It's hard not to include an account by one of them. How do you not include an account of a survivor of a ship who's magazine gets penetrated and explodes with him on it? I guess he was way up high in the top observational area. D Still Call that a crows nest. He said he was 180 feet high. His name is c Follmer, and here's how he describes the explosion of the hms into forgettable. While he was on board, there was a terrific explosion aboard the ship. The magazines went. I saw the guns go up in the air just like matchsticks 12 inch guns. They were bodies and everything. She was beginning to settle down within half a minute. The ship turned right over and she was gone. I was 180 feet up and I was thrown well clear of the ship.

Speaker 1:          02:08:03       Otherwise I would have been sucked under. I was practically unconscious turning over really at last. I came on top of the water. When I came up, there was another fellow named Jimmy Green and we got a piece of wood. He was on one end and I was on the other end a couple of minutes afterwards. Some shells came over and Jim was minus his head, so I was left on my lonesome and to quote now about 20 minutes after that, the HMS Queen Mary, another one of these battle cruisers explodes same way. I mean a little bit different. I mean she gets hit and then there's this pause and sailors are jumping into the water and then she explodes. We have accounts from sailors who were in the water who said that the sky was. All of a sudden just filled with all this massively heavy debris that was falling down on them in the water and they're all diving under the water trying to escape giant funnels and big metal objects falling on them and probably a lot of them didn't escape. Again, more than a thousand of these sailors on board. A small handful rescued afterwards, less than less than 25 and at one point admiral beatty turns to a subordinate and says, there seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today. And he's right. They're not passing the acid test. The hypothesis that you know was the philosophical underpinnings of this entire class of warships, at least on the British side, is proving to be flawed.

Speaker 1:          02:09:31       They don't have enough armor. Speed is not turning out to be their armor and when their armor gets pierced, you know the way they're handling this ammunition and the lack of flash protectors and some other things means that the magazine is catching on fire and exploding way too easily and you can tell that it's happening too easily because I'm my German side. It's not happening. They sacrificed in some other areas, their guns are smaller, for example, they're a little slower in order to a slab, some more armor over, some of these vulnerable points, and they're not blowing up again. These Germans build ships like Mercedes and they're taking a pounding while they are running away.

Speaker 1:          02:10:17       Now that's, that's what you have to notice and what's happening in these battles. You know these ships are not stationary, they're not anchored in staying in the same spot. They're all moving and they're all moving in a specific direction. The British are chasing the Germans and the Germans are moving away. Now, if you were the British admiral, this makes perfect sense to you. You've got the bigger ships, right? And until they start exploding around you, you have more of them. Besides that, you have a bunch of big brand new, the newest, most awesome battle ships in the world. Their Queen Elizabeth Class, I've already mentioned war spite, Malaya, valiant, and all these famous ships that will all fight in the second world war. They are fresh off the docks, 15 inch guns, 30,000 tons, 13 inches of armor and babies got them with him so you darn right, these Germans are going to run away.

Speaker 1:          02:11:03       Nevermind that. You know, I tried to communicate with those battleships using flags. When you talk about Murphy's law, interposing, it's will on this battle. Part of it has to do with things that just look so silly. In hindsight. You know these ships have radio. Sometimes these admirals are not that cool about using it. Sometimes it has problems by the way, so sometimes they're blameless, but a lot of times these animals are like the old guy trying to use the computer and there's so much more comfortable with the way they were brought up and the things that they did in the maneuvers in peace time. And one of the ways these ships communicate is by running the orders of the admiral up on a flagpole. They have all these different flags and each one means something different. So when the admiral wants to communicate to the fleet, his orders, they run a flag up the flag pole on his ship, the flagship, and then every other ship is supposed to, as they see it, run up the same one and you get the message across.

Speaker 1:          02:11:57       But this is a method that was used a hundred years before in Lord Nelson's time when they're fighting Napoleon at ranges that are exponentially shorter. Does that make sense? Exponentially shorter than the distances in this battle without the smoke and all these other things. And in the peace time training, it seemed to work fine in the rigors of combat. It's not working fine. And the big battleships don't see the flag change when beatty tells them to do things. And um, they're not here when this battle first happens, they've been playing catch up the whole bottle, but now you know, are arriving on the scene and their shells are falling sort of by the Germans. And now the British think they've got these German battlecruisers pin down. Even if you know you're losing a few of your battle cruisers while you chase them. But what they don't know is that those battlecruisers are leading them into the mall of the entire German navy, which is coming up from about 40 miles away, moving towards them. What started off as the German trap flipped into the British counter trap, evolved and morphed into the encounter battle has now by almost improvisational luck, become a German ambush again, if successful, the German fleet could wipe out four or five battle cruisers and four of the newest ships in the British navy, it would be, I'm sure Winston Churchill would say, I'm sure I could speak for him here, a catastrophe and the Germans on the verge of making it happen,

Speaker 1:          02:13:34       and then a light cruiser scouting for the British sees the entire German fleet on the horizon and radios the message back to Amarillo beatty and the grand fleet under Admiral Jellicoe farther away and beatty sees those Germans very quickly too with the naked eye. The first thing he does when he realizes he's been baited into this trap is turn his battle cruisers a hundred and 80 degrees in the other direction and start booking out of there. Once again, Murphy's law, I'll say that many times in this battle if I go too deeply into it, um, once again he runs up the flag saying turnaround and the big battleships, the brand new ones don't see it and they will end up exposed out there to the entire German fleet for a while taking a pounding and dishing one out too. It should be pointed out nonetheless, what Admiral Beatty has done by turning 180 degrees away, his turn himself into bait and the Germans are following and beatty is running back towards his big fleet, which is coming up from also about 40 miles away. So now he's flipped the ambush once again and now the Germans are heading toward the only fleet that is still invisible on this naval battlefield to anyone. The Germans don't know that the British grand fleet is up ahead of them,

Speaker 1:          02:14:58       but now the British Grand Fleet knows that the Germans are coming. An Admiral Jellicoe in a, in a very brave move. I mean he's operating without enough information. Once again, admiral beatty gets blamed for not given him, you know, good positional information or whatnot, but a lot of this falls into the category of. It's a dress rehearsal to these guys. A lot of their errors are the kinds of things they would have corrected if they'd had a chance to practice it in, you know, combat situations. Unfortunately these are a lot of, you know, you wouldn't call them rookie mistakes, but. But you would correct these before the next battle. Nonetheless, jellicoe takes a chance, deploys the entire British grand fleet, which is more than 100, ships over 15, 20 square miles of ocean. It takes 15 to 20 minutes. That's how well trained this fleet is. And he deploys the whole thing and he's waiting for the Germans to arrive and the Germans are now in the midst, right? This battlefields, very misty and you'll, you'll run through fog banks and you won't see things for awhile and the Germans can't see what's going on. And famously Amro hipper, who's the German admiral in charge of the battlecruisers radios, Admiral Shear the head of the entire German navy, who's with the German fleet here, and he famously looks off into the mist and tell sheer something lurks in that soup. We would do well not to thrust into it too deeply, too late.

Speaker 1:          02:16:20       The first thing that happens is, is the German start taking some fire and they don't know from where big guns. And then all of a sudden the missed parts for a. and

Speaker 6:          02:16:30       it's a nother British battlecruisers the invincible. And as soon as the mist parts in the invincible becomes clear, you know, it doesn't take 90 seconds before big German guns are opening fire, the shells pouring down on the invincible. And like the other two battle cruisers, the invincible explodes.

Speaker 6:          02:16:51       So if anybody has forgotten in the intervening, you know, hour or two, since the earlier battlecruisers exploded, that this design is proving to be somewhat flawed. The explosion of the invincible before the two main fleets collide is a historical reminder. Nonetheless. It's only soon after that that the Germans emerge from the mist to find the entire deployed British fleet waiting for them in like a crescent around the horizon and sheer says the minute that they can see what's happening, the entire horizon erupts in a sheet of flame. Now these ships are a long way from each other, almost invisible to the naked eye, smudges up against the horizon. You see like the smoke of all the ships and then you see like the flash of the guns and just like lightening and thunder where you see the lightening and then there's this delay and then the thunder arrives.

Speaker 6:          02:17:45       Same thing. You see this flash and it's silent and then boom, the boom hits you after the shells have already passed over and you know there are destroyers in these battles. We haven't even talked about all the lights. Ships running around, you know, sort of parrying and like, like a bunch of little gnats between the battle fleet and these destroyers sometimes describe what it's like when these giant shells pass over their heads and they say they sound like locomotives when they screech over your little ships head, but when they fall in front of your little ship, you're like your little destroyer. They raise geysers of water, sometimes 100, sometimes 200 feet up into the air and it's composed of tons of liquid, which then falls back down to earth. And these destroyers, these little ships are sometimes beaten up pretty severely by all this water smashing back down into them. Some people are splashed overboard and all these kinds of things.

Speaker 6:          02:18:39       Nonetheless, Admiral Jellicoe has performed a famous naval maneuver that you never want to be on the receiving end of called crossing the t where he's formed the top crossbar of the t and poor shear. And the Germans form the, um, you know, vertical line of the t and every one of the British ships can fire on the German ships individually as they come to the front of the line. It's a disaster very quickly. Sheer gets hit with more than 22 heavy shells fast. And within 10 minutes shear has quite tactically adroitly by the way, turned his fleet around and disappeared back into the mist and once again without radar and all that kind of stuff, uh, hard to, you know, know where he is at that point and he sends out a bunch of light units and destroyers and what not to cover his escape. So the, the British can't just after them, they might

Speaker 1:          02:19:27       run into a bunch of torpedoes and mines and stuff. And then inexplicably, not too long after the sheer arrives back into visual range and you know, people fire again and then sheer escapes again because he got his t crossed for a second time in one battle, which is almost unheard of. It shows you jellicoe is pretty darn good admiral. And then there's a little night action between the light units, but about this time admiral shares had enough. You get your tea cross twice in one day. It's time to call it a battle. And Shear in the Germans manage to limp home

Speaker 1:          02:20:02       when all is said and done. The British lose three battlecruisers, three armored cruisers and destroyers, while one German battle cruiser, one pre dreadnought battleships for light cruisers and destroyers are sent to the bottom. The casualties at Jutland are not significant. They don't hurt either navy badly. Uh, the British learned their lesson about the battle cruiser design, but the Germans are humbled, you know, they don't come out again in strength. I mean there's, there'll be a little encounter here and a little try there. But, but this is it. They gave it an attempt and they seemed permanently shaken because of it. The German surface fleet will not perform another militarily significant move in the war. The only part of the German navy that's going to be relevant for the rest of the war is the part that uses torpedoes to go after. Not military targets, but economic ones. By 1916, the economic side of this war is coming to the fore.

Speaker 1:          02:21:14       We begin to see what war on this scale is like when it becomes part of the normal life of all of these countries. Do you know this isn't a new phenomenon anymore? By 1916, by the middle of 1916, we've been doing this for two years and it's been sucking up more and more of the energy of these nation states that are involved in the conflict. It's very unlike the way most wars by these powers had been fought where the civilian population might not even know a war is happening if it was happening, they certainly weren't directly or importantly impacted. This war is different. First of all, it's life or death. The stakes are so high that everybody's involved and the armies are requiring such immense amounts of stuff. You know, the Germans will call this material schlock the war of material that the entire civilian population and the production capacity of all these countries gets warped. Trying to provide it. As historian Gwynne Dyer says, quote, it is significant that the phrase homefront

Speaker 6:          02:22:26       came into use during World War One when the role of munitions workers, enough civilian production more generally was becoming as important to victory as the soldiers in the trenches without a constant flow of supplies equal to the vast consumption at the front. The soldiers would soon be helpless, and since the mobilization of so huge, a number of men left vast gaps in the normal workforce, France had put 20 percent of its entire population into uniform, Germany, 18 percent and the other major powers, not much less. The remaining adult civilians had to be directed by government into whatever jobs were needed to keep production going. In effect, the civilian economy he writes, was conscripted to the governments of Europe quickly took control over labor and raw materials, imposed rationing, scarce goods, and created true war economies. Women flooded into factories to replace the men at the front and most production beyond the basic needs of subsistence was diverted into the war effort and quote, diyers, also the one that said, by this time, quote, battles had become an industrial operation in reverse.

Speaker 6:          02:23:38       In which the rates of destruction at the front matched the rates of production in the industry's at home. And to quote, I think of guys like the British military leader, Hey meg, or even the German military leader General Eric Von Falcon Han and I think about all these skills that they're required to have now above and beyond what you would think of as a normal generals skills. And you saw this in earlier wars. There's famous stories of General Sherman in the civil war in the United States being extra qualified for modern warfare because of all these failed jobs in private industry. He'd had the taught him all these lessons that no one knew at general would need in modern warfare. Things about logistics and stuff like that. But by 1916, you a guy like, hey, a cavalry commander. It looks like he would be totally out of his element, uh, dealing with the modern production needs of warfare as indeed he was Falcon Hines, a bit more scientific of a guy.

Speaker 6:          02:24:39       And he's, you know, I was trying to think if I were general fall behind, if this were a war game. And, you know, I played a lot of those in my time and I, and I got a signed because I don't think I would take Germany, uh, if I had a choice of which side of the war game I wanted to play, but let's say I get assigned to Germany and I command and played Germany in this war game and I'm Falcon, you know, the estimates are, especially during this time period that if you include the colonial subjects of the, of the powers in Europe during this time period, my enemies in this war, if I'm falling behind and have $750 million people they can call on for their value in their effort. And in some cases their lives. My side of the alliance has about $150 million.

Speaker 1:          02:25:25       My enemies have the greatest fleet in the world. And I just learned at the battle of Jutland that my navy can't come anywhere near touching them

Speaker 1:          02:25:34       and they've shut down all of my overseas trade. So if I'm General Falcon High and already I'm sitting here going, wow, now you look at the lineup in terms of the kinds of countries in each alliance, right? You have the British and the French and the Russians as the three big guys in the allied Entente alliance. These are all first rate powers. Betsy power, best land power, biggest power, all three together. Wow. And then they have a bunch of other countries like Italy and smaller powers. That's a very powerful force. Who Do I have on my side? Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey. Basically, none of those powers are first rate. At least the Turks aren't asking me for help all the time. If I'm Falcon nine though, they're putting on a pretty brave fight. They've managed to kick the British, French, South Africans, Indians, New Zealanders and Australians out of Gullapalli in January, 1916. That's unexpected.

Speaker 1:          02:26:31       They've managed to beat the British forces, mostly Indian troops in a place called coot and modern day Iraq trap them in a fortress. They're forced them to surrender and took them on a death march, but it really doesn't impact Falcon hind very much. One way or the other, it's just nice for him to know that the Turks are winning as opposed to losing because they are losing against the Russians, but it's a mixed bag. Remember, the Turks are tough, but they are not quite a 20th century army, so those are all that's gravy to Falcon Hein. The bigger problem, if you're [inaudible] hine is your, your close allies, the Austro-hungarian, they're a pain in the rear. They don't listen to you to begin with. You're having fights with their main military leaders and then they go do what they want anyway and then they screw up because they didn't follow your advice and then they come to you and say, will you bail us out? If you're falling behind? They're a pain in the rear and he's continually having to take scarce troop from places like Verdun and instead taking the train, sending them over east and and saving the Hungarians Bacon.

Speaker 1:          02:27:32       Can't really blame them though. They're in big trouble anyway. They may not have been a country in 1920, even if there hadn't been a first world war. They're made up of 11 major ethnic groups in that state, some of whom don't want to be there, and their army is a microcosm of their state and you've got troops who don't even want to be in your empire at times on the front line that you're asking to die for your empire. It's not a good situation. They're constantly getting into trouble and as one German diplomat famously says about Germany's situation with Austria hungry, we are fettered to a corpse were tied to a dead guy, and that's the Austro-hungarian forced. Now in your favor, if you're Falcon Hine, you probably have the best army in the world. The 1916

Speaker 6:          02:28:22       German army is fantastic. It's a combination of the best aspects of the 1914 force that Germany went to war with, but battle hardened by experience. Here's the way writer in Passingham describes it, quote, it is true that the German army on the western front by early 1916, was more skilled and better equipped for trench warfare. The neither the British or the French. This is not too surprising. He says, as the British expeditionary force, it only just expanded its army from around 250,000 in 1914 to just over a million, largely inexperienced men and the French he writes, had always been uncomfortable with the notion of defensive operations rather than the offensive spirit. He then says, quote, many of the German veterans of the inconclusive, though bitter fighting at IPA, Chappelle artois champagne and loose in 1915 had survived and stiffened, didn't army that had been well led at the sharp end and remained resolute against allied efforts in the West.

Speaker 6:          02:29:23       It had come close to beating the Russian armies on the eastern front in that year. Also, in short, as John Terrain has noted, it must never be forgotten that the German army of that period was very good indeed and quote. So that's what you bring to the table. Is that enough? Is having the best army in the world enough. And by the way, that's something you traditionally think of when you think of the French, but it's safe to say, I think that since about 18, 70, the Germans have the best army in the world. Will that compensate for all the downsides of the central powers? Have hard to know. One of the worst is the fact that the left hand and the right hand don't know what each other are doing in the central powers. The Austrians go off the reservation all the time. Don't tell anybody what they're doing, don't get any approval, don't work together with anyone, and it's a handicap, especially when the allies slash entente forces are pretty darn good at this.

Speaker 6:          02:30:21       They have an agreement that they made in 1915 to come to the aid of each other when hard pressed, when the Germans launch for done within a month, the Russians come riding to the rescue in Lithuania trying to help they launch an offensive that they are clearly not ready for and how could you be? That would be a very short time in this period to have planned and stocked up for and carried out an offensive. In March 19, 16, the Russians throw human wave attacks at the Germans and predictably get mowed down. The Germans, you know, looking at the corpses, thought these people totally untrained cannon fodder as though the Russians were willing to throw tons of human meat at the Germans simply to scare them enough so that they would pull some units out of redundant, takes some pressure off the French. It was so inept that some of the casualties the Russian soldiers suffered were because of being shelled by their own sides. Artillery, which is always a tragedy, and 12,000

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       Russian soldiers froze in one night. A lot of these were wounded, bought a bunch, were people that just, you know, we're out there in the cold without the proper stuff. I mean the Russian logistics are traditionally pretty horrible, especially in this period. It shows you the nature of operations there. The Russians are not generally thought of is handling these sorts of things. Well and in March 1916, they don't handle it well. Again, the worst part probably from the Russian perspective though, is they went to all that trouble and it didn't take any pressure off the French at Verdun. The follow up effort though, by the Russians on June fourth, 1916 will be handled much better, surprisingly well. If you're a guy like Falcon Hein and you've written off with a lot of your other generals, any chance the Russians have of doing anything significant in 1916 on June fourth, 1916, the Russians do something very significant lead by their unquestionably best general in the first world war. A guy named Bruce Hill off.

Speaker 1:          02:32:31       We had mentioned in an earlier episode that the Russians simply couldn't attack. I mean they were. They were okay sometimes on the defense, but they couldn't attack on. The problem is always the same. They just have such an old fashioned, not up to date logistic system that the farther you moved away from where you started, the harder it was to get the supplies necessary for modern army to run. But Brasil of is the most modern commander the Russians have. He's been learning from fighting the best army in the world. The Germans all this time, and even though he's a cavalry commander and they have a reputation for always being sort of old fashioned Bursa love, embraces the new systems out there in the new technology. For example, he does something almost no Russian army ever does in the first world war. He uses aircraft to help as spotters and to locate positions behind the lines and for reconnaissance right there, he's acting in a much more modern way than Russian armies do. Remember we're talking about an army that for the entire length of the first world war will still be wearing cloth cap. They never get metal helmets during the duration of the first world war. So this is a very old fresh fashioned army law of takes. What he can do that's modern and uses it.

Speaker 1:          02:33:49       He launches his famous offensive named after him on June fourth, and he does so with a very modern artillery barrage intense but short. He's used all sorts of camouflage to hide his intentions. He went as far as painting fake trenches on the ground behind his lines to confuse the Germans and the Austro-hungarian is on the other side.

Speaker 1:          02:34:13       And when he launches his attack, he does so along an enormous front, the eastern front, very different than the western front, and instead of being this really constrained small area which they can build a wall from side to side real easily, it's a huge area, so it's much more thinly defendant. And what [inaudible] does is he attacks across this giant front with a half million men intending to break upon the defenses of the central powers, like a way of breaks on a breakwater. And knowing that in many places his forces will get pushed backwards. But where he meets weakness, they should burst through. Here's the way writer Gj Meyer explains what happens on June fifth, within hours after the artillery bombardments starts, they have million Russian forces step out of their trenches and moved toward the mostly Austro-hungarian lines, but they're a German troops. To quote his infantry when it attacked on June fifth, found the Austrians and confusion.

Speaker 1:          02:35:15       It's advanced, stunned them with its scope extending as it did along the line of more than 250 miles still loves. The idea was that by attacking everywhere, he was sure to find holes somewhere and he had moved his reserves, scant, though they were close enough to the front so that they could exploit opportunities as soon as any appeared, and he continues quote, and the result was from the first hour a success of almost incredible magnitude. The Austro-hungarian Fourth Army disintegrated when hit 71,000 of its men. More than half the army were killed, wounded or captured. The seventh was wrecked even more completely losing 133,000 men. It was the same almost everywhere. After three days, bruce, he found himself in possession of 300,000 prisoners before the end of the week. More than half of the Austrian defenders had become casualties and quote Brasil have shattered the Austrians, and then he ran into the typical problem. Any Russian commander runs into the inability of the Russian army in government to get him enough stuff fast enough for him to not slow down and have his offensive Peter out.

Speaker 1:          02:36:31       But this maneuver had a domino effect on the war because at Verdun Falcon Hein now had a crisis on his hands in the east where he was going to have to pull troops out of Verdun to go save the Austro-hungarian army, which was disintegrating. And let's understand the Austro-hungarian forces we told you about those, those troops who were a microcosm of the empire as a whole who didn't want to be there. You had whole units and I mean battalions, regiments of slobs throw down their weapons and surrender to the Russians, who by the way are Slavs to let us not forget that this war began when a slavic national assassinated austro-hungarian heir to the throne, right? And now we're asking slavs to fight for that empire. Many of them threw down their weapons. They didn't want to die, and they certainly do more die fighting for that empire, and they certainly didn't want to die fighting for that empire against their Slavic brethren.

Speaker 1:          02:37:32       In fact, some of these units are said to have jumped into the trenches with the Russians, turned around and trained their guns back on the side. They had just defected from the Germans, will manage to contain with their wonderful army, the Russian threat, and they will halt mercy, loves advance, and even deal a defeat to the Russians, but already the single minded focus of falcon heights on Verdun has been shattered. The Russians who put in such a wonderful effort in the brewster love offensive and did such terrible damage to the Austrians suffered immensely though while doing so well over a million casualties suffered in the brewery love offensive, which once again takes the Russians and begins to ratchet up the level of dissatisfaction, getting them closer and closer to the breaking point. You can almost feel it in the air. In 1916, a couple of these major powers are within one good punch of going down in the spring of 1916. French military leader, Joseph you offer, tells his British counterpart that France is one of those nations

Speaker 1:          02:38:43       within a good shot of going down. Remember, you know by this time they've had a month or two at Verdun. The French have suffered like 200,000 casualties and at least this early two months into 10, but nobody knows it yet. At the battle of redundant looks like the German leader, Falcon Heinz plan to bleed. The French army white is working. That's why you can't take your eyes off the first world war. They're like two prize fighters and just when you think one guy's taken over the fight, the other guidelines, a good shot and somebodies knees buckle, and in the spring of Nineteen 16, Jennifer tells Sir Douglas Haig, the current commander of British forces, it's France whose knees had been buckled and he urges Hague to start that summer offensive that he's been planning for a long time on the river somme early. He says, if you don't start it early, the French army will cease to exist. He gets so worked up. We're told that he can only be consoled and calmed down with lots of 1840 brandy, you know, from the year 18, 40 chauffeur needed good brandy to calm down.

Speaker 1:          02:39:47       Nonetheless, Haig speeds up the big offensive plan for the summer of 1916. Discussed with all the other allies in late 1915, this is a longterm plan and the going gonna launch it early. This longterm plan results in the most controversial piece from the British standpoint of this whole war, maybe of British military history in its entirety. First of all, Douglas Haig, you have to understand that the field marshal the Java was talking to is the new guy. Just like most of the great powers in the first world war. By 1916, they fired the person that got them into this mess, right? The wars terrible. Everybody's predictions were wrong. Nobody's fighting it well, so one by one, all of these countries are sac in the people that got them into this mess, the Russians dropped. There's the Germans have falcon heights because they got rid of unmold killed while the war was, you know, in its early phases, the French still have shopped for a crazily enough.

Speaker 1:          02:40:47       But um, you know, that reputation of the miracle of the and in 1914 will only carry you so far. He doesn't have long to go either and the British in late 1950 and Sir John French, like we told you in the last episode, the guy who gets his gig is a guy named Douglas Haig. It'll be a field marshal. He's another one of these cavalry commanders. So it was weird. We have a war where cavalry becomes something that you keep off to the side and don't use because it just gets killed and the horses are more important to move stuff because crazily enough, and we haven't talked enough about this and we'll get to it. Horses are everywhere. There's millions of them in this war and their casualties too, by the way, but all these cavalry commanders, French, hey golf, these guys have these visions that we're going to break the German lines somewhere and then the cavalry is going to go rushing in the hole we create and go into the back.

Speaker 1:          02:41:37       And it's, it's the pre, you know, Wehrmacht Armor, Blitzkrieg version of that. That's a strategy that's been used throughout history, right? Um, goes back to pre Alexander time, smashed the cavalry into the hole and roll up the lines. It's blitzkrieg before you have motor vehicles, and that's what these cavalry commanders are still dreaming of two years into the war that puts the final nail into the coffin, into the idea that this cavalry has any offensive role to play. Although you have to remember, it still is the fastest moving thing on the battlefield. In large numbers, you're starting to get motor vehicles, but you know, tough for the motor vehicles to handle terrain and they're very unreliable. Horses are still the fastest mobility you have, so they're valuable just for that point alone. They're very vulnerable though. And the stories of, of, of dead horses in the suffering of animals in the story is under discussed.

Speaker 1:          02:42:33       Nonetheless. Douglas Haig, the new British cavalry commander, um, has at his disposal some of the largest really the largest armies that Britain has ever had ready to go to war because those volunteers that started joining when Lord Horacio Kitchener, you'll remember the British military leader from the beginning of the war. The guy who, when you see his picture, screams, 19th century man on it. I mean, you know, with the giant mustache from another area, you can almost see him in a British red coat and he's the big face on the recruiting poster telling Britain's patriotic Britain's to sign up for king and country and a shilling and kitchen is another one of these prewar early war generals and military leaders who's been tarred by, you know, their conduct in the war. They don't, they don't end up looking so genius like when the first world war gets done with you, right.

Speaker 1:          02:43:22       So as kitchener, his reputation is starting to wane. He still got one real feather in his cap and that's that those armies that he helped recruit in 1914 in 1915 and that he is protected like a proud parent, you know, don't send them to Gullapalli. Don't send him to the western front early. Don't throw them in the meat grinder like everything else, save them and really make use of their patriotic contribution. These people want to win the war, let's put them in a position where they can do that. He's done an admirable job of that in about three weeks before those soldiers known sometimes as the kitchen or armies or the kitchen or divisions after him are going to lose the guy that was probably most responsible for seeing that they weren't used up already in the first place. Kitchener dies about three weeks before his legions are thrown into the frame.

Speaker 1:          02:44:09       It's a crazy story. I'm told that it is the same as any one of those big modern deaths, so so the same as a princess or lady Diana dying or Winston Churchill dying or JFK dying in the United States. You say to yourself, do you remember when that happened? And Britain's of the period, remember where they were when they heard that Lord Horacio Kitchen. They're British military leader and almost Demi God, at least at the beginning of the war, has gone down at sea while on a war ship on the way to Russia on some military mission and the boat goes down at night in a force nine gail after hitting a mine, and there are survivors who say, take this with a grain of salt that they saw kitchener on the deck as the ship went down in passively sort of accepting his fate and just standing on the deck as the ship goes, you know, beneath the waves that really works with that whole 19th century military leader reputation, doesn't it?

Speaker 1:          02:45:06       Nonetheless, there have been conspiracy theories ever since about this. Believe it or not, it's one of the Great Conspiracy Know Fountain heads to come out of the first world war. Nonetheless, it meant the three weeks later when kitchener's, you know, parentally preserved armies are finally thrown into the fray. He's not there to have any say in it. The Guy who is is Douglas Haig, the new guy now known to some in history as the butcher. So that should give you an idea of what we're about to get into here on a wide variety of fronts. This battle is won that Sir Douglas Haig has been preparing for since the year before when the French told him that they were in danger of disintegrating. He's moving up something he's been working on for awhile now and everyone knows it. The big 1916 offensive is no secret. Hekaton newspapers basically means that when you find out all the ways that everybody knew this was coming, it makes you wonder again how intelligent it is to be launching something that everybody knows is coming, but it couldn't really be helped.

Speaker 1:          02:46:14       If you're going to fight at this spot on the Somme River with the British and the French forces meet on the western front where the where the British line ends and the French line begins, that's where they're going to hold this joint offensive. Maybe for the sole reason that that's where both armies are. That would be a really silly reason to attack the greatest defenses on the western front, which are the greatest defenses ever in the world right now. These are defenses that make the old Roman, um, you know, lines that you would cross Europe with these giant wall miner. It has never been defensive like this. The Germans are at the point now where they're building creature comforts into their fortified line. I mean, they're putting wallpaper on and they've got electric lights and ventilation and then no running water. I mean it's crazy though. The trenches or in some cases all lined with wood boards done with about as much thorough on this as the Germans are known for.

Speaker 1:          02:47:10       These are huge modern fortifications in some sense. And these Germans on the other side of this line where the French and the British are thinking about launching this big 1916 offensive have bunkers that are 30 and 40 feet underground, cut into the chalk of these hills that the Germans occupied. They are looking down for months as the British load up. All the stuff you now need for a modern offensive. All that stuff. We said that the German's needed at Verdun, the British need at the Somme, right? The French too, by the way. They've laid five railroad lines, you know, new tracks to the battlefield because that's how often and how many trains are going to be running, just unloading stuff for months, $3, million shells, millions of tons of food. I mean crazy in engineering corps that are building things, you know, full on permanent structures. While the Germans watched the whole thing and plan for it and trained for it, they're having drills every day.

Speaker 1:          02:48:08       You know, how quickly can we get up from our underground bunker and get up to the trench and man the machine guns before the British soldiers are on top of us, right? Everybody knows this is coming and everybody knows how it's going to be fought. The British take these armies with many, many, many green troops that had never been in a battle, puts them in the trenches opposite these German lines. Again, a position so strong that Winston Churchill says it was undoubtedly the strongest and most perfectly defended position in the world and the quote, and start bombarding it with artillery starts June 20, fourth, 19, 16, early. By the way, a lot of artillery. As a matter of fact, the song becomes one of about four or five first world war battles that compete for like the Guinness Book of World Records for the biggest, largest, worst, more intense, most numerous, you know, pick your category, artillery bombardment of the war

Speaker 1:          02:49:09       there. You know, as a history geek, I would be arguing it with my other history geek friends. And, and it's always about criteria, right? Are we talking about the largest number of shells fall throughout an entire battle, you know, 40 to 60 million of verdun maybe. Or are we talking about the most number of shells used in the initial part of the battle or the most number of shells dropped in the shortest period of time or the smallest space. I mean, there's literally a measurement of how many tons of shells fell on each square meter of these battlefields. And by the way, if you use that as your criterion for Dunn is the worst artillery bombardment, um, in history. Nonetheless, the fact that the psalm is in this argument shows you the level of artillery we're talking about here. And when it opens up on the 24th, it's, it's incredible and it's volume, but the Germans laugh a little.

Speaker 1:          02:49:58       I mean it's a huge bombardment, but the Germans are mostly underground and under cover and most of the bombardment is, once again, shrapnel shells, sounds like a little teeny point, doesn't it for a battle to turn on, but had those shells been high explosive instead, or maybe even gas, this battle may go another direction and every historian brings up that the shrapnel was pretty much pointless. It's remember it's like a giant hand grenade or shotgun shell exploding in the air and all these little pellets hit the ground. It's devastating to infantry out in the open, but the Germans aren't in the open, right? In addition, the artillery is meant to do more than just killed Germans. The artillery has to clear the battlefield of all this stuff that's there as defenses so that the troops on the British side can actually get to the German trenches. It's full of barbed wire. No Man's land, another trench than another no man's land than another trench. The trenches are all going uphill and these no man's land areas besides being filled with concrete bunkers and everything we've told you about before, the killing zones, they have yards of barbed wires thick as your finger.

Speaker 1:          02:51:08       It's a physical impediment. It has to be overcome by the generals. The generals have figured out in their minds that an artillery barrage of this caliber, the amounts we're talking about here, the barb wire will just explode into pieces. They will not be an impediment when the artillery barrages over, except the shrapnel shells, don't really affect it.

Speaker 1:          02:51:28       Now, there was a benefit to the artillery barrage, though as we've quoted before, Napoleon has this great line that comes in handy all the time. That quantity has a quality all its own and the sheer intensity of this barrage began to have an effect on the Germans, even though they were physically protected from being injured by it. It began to play on them. First of all, they know they've got something really nasty awaiting them in their future. You have to try to put yourself in their shoes. Okay? They know that when this artillery barrages over the British are going to be on them. They've been training for this moment for months, right? Run up the stairs. How quickly can you get in front of the

Speaker 6:          02:52:05       machine, gun in time to stop the British from taking over your trench so they're going to either be killed, bee grievously wounded, see a friend killed or wounded or have to kill some of them. They're going to have a really nasty day and they're very near future. In the meantime, you're going to have one of the greatest artillery barrages and history going on around you or younger who will be at this battlefield in about a month and see a an artillery barrage that is not as bad as this one. He will compare it to the roar of the ocean. He will say that there are no individual sounds and he says he will. It will achieve at times and last for hours. A demented intensity that he says when it eventually calms down, calms down to mere drum fire, which is, you know the sound of a drum roll.

Speaker 6:          02:52:53       That's how fast the artillery shells are dropping, and he says, even when it's the drum roll, you can't pick out any individual explosions. It's just one big loud sound, but the demented theory that it reaches sometimes blows that away literally. And that's the kind of intensity these soldiers are living with, knowing that they've got this horrible moment in their future and it goes on for days and we're told that the German soldiers who were kind of laughing at the fact that the British were using like 70 percent shrapnel shells on them aren't laughing anymore. They're getting tired and stressed and you know, put yourself in the position of just not sleeping for five days and now, you know, add all the other things on top of that. So there is an effect that this artillery is having. And the Germans all right about it. Um, the British commander, this is part of the controversy.

Speaker 6:          02:53:40       We're told that there were lots of people saying that this artillery barrage was going to make this a cake walk. And you've heard that before, right? Don't all these battles between to sound like isn't there a repetitiveness to the story? If there is, you're getting the right feeling out of it because that's how you know it's always been played and it seems like the people at the time felt too. Oh No, not again, haven't we seen this movie before? The general seem to always just want more stuff. Give us more artillery, give us more men, give us deeper defensive, you know, we'll fix this situation. So here's the biggest artillery barrage. The British I've ever launched. They shoot off 2 million shells in no time. And just for comparison purposes, 100 years before this time, at the battle of waterloo, Napoleon is estimated to have had about 20,000 Canon balls with the French army.

Speaker 6:          02:54:27       So you know, 2 million shells in a week or two versus 20,000. It's, it's crazy. The level of artillery we're going to see here and it, it lowers the commander's into this sense that it's going to accomplish so much more than it does. It's the soldiers on the ground though that produced the historical reminders that most of them were too realistic and to savvy and too cynical to buy into any of that. Rosie thinking that generals could afford to be rosy. The guys on the ground going in, for example, the first wave of this assault that the Germans had been waiting for you for months. They know better and you can tell because there are absolutely heartbreaking. Last letters home that have made it into the history books. Peter Hearts, wonderful book on the Great War, um, has one of these letters from a captain Charles May who fights in the 22nd Manchester Regiment and he's writing to his wife right before he goes over the top in this battle.

Speaker 6:          02:55:24       And, and, and again, imagine, imagine how it affects you to be in the position of writing a letter like this. I always think that that's, that's a permanent scar on your soul. Even if you get the proverbial reprieve from the governor, right from Captain Charles may have the 22nd Manchester Regiment who's about to go over the top on the first day of the somme. And writes his wife, quote, I must not allow myself to dwell on the personal. There is no room for it. Here also, it is demoralizing, but I do not want to die. Not that I mind for myself. If it'd be that I am to go, I'm ready, but the thought that I may never see you or are darling baby again, it turns my bowels to water. I cannot think of it with even the semblance of equanimity. My one constellation is the happiness that's been ours.

Speaker 6:          02:56:15       Also, my conscience is clear that I've always tried to make life a joy to you. I know at least that if I go you will not want that is something, but it is the thought that we may be cut off from one another which is so terrible and that our baby may grow up without my knowing her and without her knowing me. It's difficult to face and I know your life without me would be a double blank, yet you must never let it become holy. So for to you will be left the greatest charge and all the world, the upbringing of our baby. God blessed that child. She's the hope of life to me, my darling are of law. It may be that you will only have to read these lines as ones of passing interest. On the other hand, they may well be my last message to you if they are no through all your life that I loved you and baby with all my heart and soul and that you to sweet things were just all the world to me.

Speaker 6:          02:57:08       I pray, God, I may do my duty for I know that whatever that may entail, you would not have it otherwise and to quote and Peter Hard with remarkable sensitivity as a postscript and says, quote Charles may the loving husband to Bessie Mae and father to his baby, pauline would indeed be killed. The next day he is buried in the dancing, galley, British cemetery, small scale tragedies, litter, the history of war, sad reminders that the necessities of war ruined the lives of millions and the quote it says, we said all this pain from this war or like pebbles dropped in water and the ripples outward effect. The rest of these societies, when you have millions of people impacted like this, the ripple effect effects tens or maybe even hundreds of millions of people

Speaker 1:          02:58:02       for a while. The song becomes one of these pebbles that's like ground zero for a huge ripple effect that will affect Britain. To this day.

Speaker 1:          02:58:14       I try to think about what mental state I would be in after writing a letter like that and when you think about millions of people, young people mostly being in situations where they're writing a letter like that, how does that change? You mean there are going to be noticeable changes in this generation of people in the four years during this first World War I've been comparing this period to a historical estuary, right? Where one generation and another generation sort of mingled the the old world and the new world, but maybe it's more of a worm hole through time and when this 19th century group of people, you know, transitions through to the 20th century, it's not going to make it intact. It's going to suffer damage on the way through. It's like a birthing process to the modern era and that can be bloody and painful and potentially fatal to

Speaker 1:          02:59:10       the British have thought throughout this war that they've taken large casualties in the battles of 1915 places like deliberately. Those are large casualties for the British, which are a traditionally naval power and employee relatively by continental standards, small armies. This was the first time they've had a large enough army to suffer the kind of casualties that some nations like the French or the Germans or the Russians had been suffering this whole time. On July first 1916, the shelling subsides. The whistles blow and these troops in the morning or told to get out of their trenches and had across into no man's land and continued to take the German defenses and this is where they find out that the assumptions made in the planning stages of this conflict haven't come to pass the way the military experts assumed they would. And because of that, British forces on the very first day of the battle of the somme will suffer. 60,000 casualties, 20,000 dead. There's never been a day like it in British history and now all of a sudden they can understand how the French felt you on that August Day in 1914 when they suffer 22,000 dead in an afternoon. These are thoroughly modern casualties into people not accustomed to them. They are stunning and the fingers start pointing immediately. What the heck happened?

Speaker 1:          03:00:41       A generation of people who've felt this visceral really have kept this debate going and it continues between historians even today. What the hell happened? Who's responsible for this? What happened to the troops? Will they got out of the trenches only to find that in most areas, the that this

Speaker 6:          03:01:00       artillery would smash up the wire wasn't true and the wire was there. It was a physical impediment in no man's land trapping troops in the open so they could be raped by machine gun fire, artillery fire too, but mainly machine gunfire from those Germans who were not as badly affected by the artillery either as the planners had assumed they would be. Tens of thousands of British soldiers are being mowed down all the time. One German on the other side of this human tragedy at the battle of the Somme on the first day is quoted in Ian passing in his book, all the Kaiser's men and he says, quote, the leading wave of British troops was now halfway across. No Man's land. Get ready was passed along our front and heads appeared over each shell crater edge, just final positions were taken up for the best view and machine guns mounted firmly in place.

Speaker 6:          03:01:53       A moment later when the first British line was within 100 yards, the rattle of machine gun and rifle fire broke out along our whole line of shell holes, followed soon after by deadly accurate shellfire, the advanced rapidly crumbled under this hail of Shell and bullets. All along the line, men could be seen throwing up their arms and collapsing, never to move again. The extended lines, though badly shaken and with many gaps now came on all the faster. Instead of a leisurely walk, they covered the ground in short, rushes at the double, and within a few minutes the leading troops had advanced to within a stone's throw of our front trench again and again. The extended lines of British infantry broke against the German defense like waves against a cliff only to be beaten back. It was an amazing spectacle of unexampled, gallantry courage and bulldog determination on both sides and quote.

Speaker 6:          03:02:45       Now those are the troops who made it through the wire. There were places where gaps had been blown in the wire. The problem was as the troops would congregate at those gaps because they're the only way to the other side, and then get stuck in giant backups as as a small stream of troops made it through the corridor and those those backups in those globs of soldiers just waiting for their chance to get through the corridor, the wire would be mowed down by shell fire and machine gun fire this day has so affected the British, in fact, it's their version of redundancy. What ridden is to the French soul. The Psalm is to the British one, and in his divided historians ever since, and you can see normally calm and sedate rather cold. Sometimes British historians lose their head over this subject. I mean John Keegan, who, um, I've, I've said it's not my favorite but, but the, the two world wars I think are, are his strong point and you can tell he's a guy who's hung out with some of the enlisted troops that were trapped that day at the somme because their continued anger and incredibility about this whole thing has rubbed off on him.

Speaker 6:          03:03:51       And by the way, if you were trapped there like a sitting duck on, you know, an open plane in no man's land watching your buddies get blown to bits and you're freaking out. You would be thinking to, who the hell put me here? Who's responsible for this? If I ever get out of this, heads will roll. And of course, most of these British troops at this battle or not have a class in British society that could have made much of a fuss, but they've got loyal defenders who will, when this is over, Keegan's one of them, by the way, you can. You can just feel the anger when he writes quote

Speaker 6:          03:04:24       in all, the British had lost about 60,000 of whom 21,000 have been killed most in the first hour of the attack. Perhaps the first minutes the trenches wrote Robert Key. Fifty years later. Now he's quoting Robert key quote where the concentration camps of the first world war now Keagan talks again and though the analogy is what an academic review or would call an historical, there is something Treblinka like about almost all accounts of the first of July about these long dos lines of young men. Shoddily uniformed heavily burdened numbered about their next to identify after they were killed, plodding forward across a featureless landscape to their own extermination. Inside the barbed wire accounts of the psalm, he writes, producing readers and audiences much the same range of emotions as do descriptions of the running of Auschwitz, guilty fascination, incredulity, horror, disgust, pity and anger and quote, and then he goes on to say that this is not just from the peaceniks and tenderhearted out there, not just from the military historians where you get it from either but he goes, but from the professional troops to he says, quote, anger is the response which the story of the Somme most commonly evokes among professionals, meaning soldiers. Why did the commander's not do something about it? Why do they let the attack go on? Why did they not stop one battalion following the wake of another to join it in death and quote?

Speaker 6:          03:05:57       He then goes on to say that some battalions were stopped, but that's one of the things that so many people got angry about is that once you saw, for example, that the wire was still there, why did you let more lines of troops get up out of the trenches and followed the people who just got destroyed in front of them? This is how someone like, Hey, Haig gets a reputation for a butcher. Now I've gone out of my way in this program. I think you've probably noticed too in 1915, cut these general slack because they're learning, right? This is all new stuff and until you experiment a little, you don't know how to use it. You don't know what it can do, but at what point can you start holding these people accountable for not learning? There was a great line from the civilian political leader, Germany,

Speaker 6:          03:06:52       a guy named Beth [inaudible] and he was telling Kaiser by the end of 1916, he's talking about Falcon nine here, the German military leader, but it could equally apply to a lot of military leaders in this war, especially at this time. He asked the kaiser quote, where does incompetency end and criminality begin and to quote, how many lives are you allowed to lose experimenting before you learn your lessons? But there are a great many military historians today who are trying once again to say, listen, that's what they're doing. We're still holding them to too high a standard. Too much hindsight going on here. Here's what Peter Harte writes, quote, for many people, the Psalm and the equally ugly Verdun have come to symbolize the great war. Few child battles fought with other people's lives by incompetence and uncaring generals in particular for the British. He says, the disaster of the first of July on the Psalm has become the sole prism through which the conduct of the whole of the great war has been viewed.

Speaker 6:          03:07:53       There is no light and shade here, just a dark, just spare the numbing horror of the teaming casualties, explanations of what went wrong and why are thrust aside indeed in the past, subdued references to a quote end quote, learning curve for the generals have been seen as an insult to the dead. There remains a widespread belief. He writes that there must have been a better way something else could or should have been done. Someone must be blamed. Much of this appropriate has fallen on the head of Douglas Haig, who has at times been reviled as a mass murderer. Yet this was the inevitable price of engaging in continental warfare on the main field of battle against the primary enemy. France was well accustomed to the pain of continental warfare, but for Britain it was a new experience. Germany had no exposed flanks, just the imposing fortifications of the western front defending their 1914 gains rested from France and Belgium.

Speaker 6:          03:08:49       Unfortunately for all their tactical improvement and technical innovations that British were just simply not able to breach those defenses or kill sufficient Germans even in concert with the French at Verdun to bring Germany to its knees and to quote. It also makes you wonder a little about the quality of the human beings who are commanding these endeavors were making these plans and who are watching all these people die and be wounded because of these plans. In other words, how bad does the general field the next day? Well, it's not something you can easily figure out. Again, John Keegan seems to be so angry at the field marshal here. I'm still for this conflict that he, he, he writes an answer to that question, kind of what kind of man do you have to be to suffer those kinds of casualties? And the next day think about continuing. Keegan writes, quote, Hey, meg, whom his contemporaries found difficult to know has become today and enigma, the successful generals of the first world war, those who did not crack outright or decline gradually into pessimism.

Speaker 6:          03:09:58       We're a hard lot as they had to be with the casualty figures accumulating on their desk. Some nonetheless managed to combine toughness of mind with some striking human characteristic is y'all. He says imperturbability, Hindenburg, gravity, fall, fire, Kemal certainty. Hey, he says in whose public manner and private diaries, no concern for human suffering was or is discernible, compensated for his aloofness with nothing whatsoever of the common touch. He seemed to move through the horrors of the first world war as if guided by some inner voice. Speaking of a higher purpose and a personal destiny that we now know he says was not just appearance. Haig was a devoted both of spiritualist practices and a fundamentalist religion. As a young officer, he had taken to attending seances where the medium put him in touch with Napoleon as commander in chief. He fell under the influence of a Presbyterian chaplain who's sermons confirmed him in his belief that he was in direct communication with God and had a major part to play in a divine plan for the world. His own simple religion Keagan says he was convinced was shared by his soldiers who were inspired thereby to bear the dangers and sufferings which were there part of the war. He was directing and quote,

Speaker 6:          03:11:24       wow, welcome to the controversy and the heat that the battle of the Somme has generated amongst those who write about it, but justifiably so, I think I'm truthfully, I think there were military people who were certainly willing to forgive Douglas Haig for suffering. 60,000 casualties on the first day of the battle of the somme. If he didn't flick, did something like 60,000 on the Germans. Instead the British suffer. Those kinds of casualty in the German casualties may have been as low as 6,000. 12,000 is the high number of you sometimes see split the difference, say 8,000, so take 60, give eight. You get your face ripped off. Not exactly the position you want, your brand new general, the new blood. The person is going to bring a new sense of success to the war on the western front. All of a sudden, Douglas Haig doesn't look a whole lot better than the people who came before him. Heck, John French could have had your separate 60,000 casualties on the first day of the Somme, right? The previous commander. Now to put those numbers in perspective, because I always have to do this for myself. 60,000. That's an amorphous number. What? What does that compare to? You have to understand that the British for 101 years by the battle of the psalms time had been talking about a horrible day. They'd suffered, you know, finishing off Napoleon, the waterloo, right in 18, 15 on Napoleon killed 84 British

Speaker 1:          03:12:52       soldiers. Eighty 400 compared to 20 or 21 or 19,000. That's huge difference, right? But how about the Second World War? You always think of the second world war as being worse than the first when the British and Americans landed on the beaches of Normandy on June six, 19, 44 for the famous Dj landings, and then pushed inland a not enough attention paid to key part of that whole thing. You know, widening at the bridge had, it was hard combat. It was historically hard combat, but it took the British and the Americans combined 20 days to reach 20,000 casualties, so it took them 20 days combined British and Americans to reach one third. The amount of casualties, the British alone suffered on the first day of the battle of the somme. That's wild. That's crazy.

Speaker 1:          03:13:42       And it sounds like Verdun doesn't it? Those numbers start to sound like what the French are suffering, that horrible battle to bleed their army white. Well, David Fromkin in his book, a piece to end all peace quotes Norman stone about, you know, how large these battles were compared to what the people in Europe are used to. And he says, quote, it has been estimated that the total of military and civilian casualties in all of Europe, domestic and international conflicts in the hundred years between 18, 15 and 1915 was no greater than a single day's combat losses in any of the great battles of 1916 and quote, that's an incredible statistic when you think of all of the battles that Europeans fought in Europe and in colonies and all those things, all of it put together and all of the European countries for a hundred years doesn't equal one of the bad days at Verdun or the somme. The societies that could handle these kinds of casualties were remarkable, but they took their toll. As you might imagine by the time five months of the psalm is over, you have another million casualties basically in five months. So freedom gives you roughly about a million. And the Psalm gives you roughly about a million all at the same time.

Speaker 1:          03:15:12       The burn rate on the western front is horrifying in 1916. And remember, all of these battles are like a lot of littler battles sort of lumped together at the somme. For example, the Germans will counter attack in that five month period, more than 300 times a ton of those counterattacks in ancient times would have been a battle all by itself, right? Part of the reason why it's so hard to follow the nature of these battles. Churchill has an overall description that is just horrifying of a conceptual view of this that makes you understand what really going on,

Speaker 6:          03:15:50       if you could view it sort of from space, and he writes about both the Somme and verdun quote,

Speaker 6:          03:15:57       the anatomy of the battles of Verdun and the Somme was the same. A battlefield had been selected around this battlefield. Walls were built double, triple, quadruple, have enormous cannon. Behind these railways were constructed to feed them and mountains are shells were built up. All this was the work of months. Thus, the battlefield was completely encircled by thousands of guns of all sizes and a wide oval space prepared in their midst. Through this awful arena, all the divisions of each army battered ceaselessly by the enveloping artillery were made to pass in succession as if they were in the teeth of interlocking cog wheels grinding each other for month after month, he writes, the ceaseless cannonade continued at its utmost intensity and month after month, the gallon divisions of heroic human beings were torn to pieces in this terrible rotation. Then came the winter, pouring down rain from the sky to clog the feet of men and drawing veils of missed before the Hawk eyes of their artillery. The arena as used to happen in the coliseum in those miniature Roman days was flooded with water. A vast sea of in sanguine mage earned by thousands of vehicles by hundreds of thousands of men and millions of shells replaced the blasted dust. Still, the struggle continued still, the remorseless wheels revolved still. The auditorium of artillery roared at last. The legs of men could no longer move. They wallowed in, floundered helplessly in the slime. They are food and ammunition lagged behind them along the smash in choked roadways. And to quote,

Speaker 6:          03:17:41       I keep quoting Churchill because wasn't that positively tolken ask by the way, there are people who you know, say that Tolkien's experiences with the first world war influenced in his way of writing and thinking, but if it did, he would have been just one of millions of other people that had their outlook transformed by this conflict. And how could you not?

Speaker 6:          03:18:08       As we said, you imagine writing that last letter home where it's essentially a goodbye letter that can change you, can't it? I known a lot of people who've had terminal illnesses, had months to know that death was in their near future. It often changes them. It often creates this introspective mood. We're all of a sudden they're focusing on subjects that people don't usually spend hour after hour, day after day, focusing on, but it's right in front of them, right? If you have terminal cancer, it's going to be on your mind and the thinking about it changes you. What if you had a terminal disease and all of a sudden at the last minute the doctors figured out a way to cure you when you were dragged back from the brink, but you'd spend a couple of months thinking intensely about life and death and the meaning of things and what you would've done differently in all these really heavy duty thoughts that most people can only stand to think about in short little bursts.

Speaker 6:          03:19:04       Usually there are exceptions. Now, imagine millions of people during this 19, 14, 19, 18 period who would have found themselves in a similar sort of a situation. Pretty much sure they were going to die in the near future. We'll be horribly disfigured thinking about the heaviest of subjects, writing letters home to loved ones saying, you know, I'm going to miss not knowing my baby daughter, and then some of them getting a reprieve and getting a chance to live this life. They were all but writing off during the worst of these war experiences. That is a searing personal experience that millions of individual persons went through. How does that not change the society when they go home and you know, one of the things about battles, especially these first world war battles is they're so dark, aren't they and theirs so industrial and they're so unbelievably horrifying.

Speaker 6:          03:20:02       The charnal houses, Zombie graveyard feel of the battlefields and the first world war make that particularly in a mind bending. You'll see a lot of art around the first world war that shows corpses decaying and it's not so you feel sympathy with the dead figure. It's so that you understand what it was like for those people living amongst all those decaying corpse is to deal with that reality. Mind bending battles mind bending enough, right? You add all the incredible artillery, which is disorienting as as all get out and then throw in bodies, pieces of bodies everywhere when you're living, as we've said, it's a unique experience.

Speaker 6:          03:20:43       It's a form of hell and yet to someone like yours truly that creates the circumstances where human brotherly love appears so like a light in the darkness. Part of why battles are interesting to study is because as you probably figured out, you can see the worst of human behavior and man's inhumanity to man in them, but you can also see these pieces of humanity slip through and when they do, they are all the more bright and noticeable because they're happening in hell as opposed to, you know, something that happens in your neighborhood, right little piece of humanity, not that surprising in your neighborhood probably makes your day a little brighter. A piece of humanity in the hell have these battlefields has a rejuvenating effect for ones feel about man. Take for example the sacrifice. These no man's land in the fighting lines of the two sides on the western front created something that the battles have had forever. I mean in the Second World War, you'd have these crossroads, for example, where some machine gunner had set up and now all of a sudden, you know, it was death to cross this crossroads, but the western front is hundreds of miles of trench lines. All of them with this dead zone in between and on the really big fronts where a lot was happening, there was tons of drama in those dead zones. Things would happen that would challenge men's morality and what you're willing to do. A perfect example is in the battle of the somme.

Speaker 6:          03:22:22       When the 60,000 casualties and a lot of other casualties over the course of that battle are happening, the Germans are often taking pity on their fellow human beings and the British right about it. I mean when these British attacks would break against the German defenses and the wounded would start back toward the safety of their own trenches, grabbing even worse wounded people with them and trying to under machine guns and artillery fire get back to their own trenches. A lot of times these Germans would just stop shooting on the first terrible day. There were oftentimes where the machine gunners in the officers would just say, stop, let them get back. It's the human thing to do. Right?

Speaker 6:          03:23:00       On the other hand, if they had just machine gun them, that window surprised anybody either, but what do you do now about those people who are stuck out there in no man's land after the attack is over? There are all sorts of stories about people who will simply, if they can drag themselves to the nearest shell hole, wrap themselves up in the tarp. They keep to keep the rain out, you know, open up a Bible and just die in those shell holes, but when they don't, they can often have a terrible effect on the men in the trenches, on both sides. The Apaches in the American south west used to be able to make such good use of hostages and if you threatened to torture a hostage or you did torture a hostage, you could get all kinds of concessions from the other side. Well, there are hostages that fate is holding in the middle of those no man's land areas. And what do you do when one of them starts asking for help and they're basically calling to you and your body's from no man's land. If you want to see their heroism and the sacrifice that human beings can show in in these hellish situations, read the accounts over and over about how men dealt with screams for help from no man's land.

Speaker 6:          03:24:17       A perfect example of the kind of moral dilemmas and self sacrifice that these situations, you know create is the story that Robert Graves tells in goodbye all that when he was serving at the Somme on the western front and a soldier named Samson gets hit in the wave before graves is wave goes over the top. So graves is just getting ready for this intense experience himself of going over the top of the trench with other human beings right into the teeth of machine gunfire. And all of a sudden you hear the sound of somebody from the last attack, from no man's land. You know where it's death to stand up and move around asking for help or screaming out. And here's what graves rights. Remember, he's, he's in the state himself and thinking, okay, I've got to walk into machine gunfire and I've just seen all these other people die in front of me.

Speaker 6:          03:25:05       Quote, my mouth was dry, my eyes out of focus and my legs quaking under me. I found a water bottle full of Ramen, drank about half a pint. It quieted me in. My head remained clear. Samson lay groaning about 20 yards beyond the front trench. Several attempts were made to rescue him. He'd been very badly hit. Three men got killed in those attempts to officers in two men wounded in the end, his own orderly managed to crawl out to him. Samson waved him back saying he was riddled through and not worth rescuing. He sent his apologies to the company for making such noise and the quote. In other words, this guy is out there screaming and it's so driving his own comrades crazy that they keep running out there to do something and everyone who runs out there to do something gets killed. At what point, if you're the wounded person, do you try to just stop making noise so that they don't keep trying to help you out of sympathy when you probably are dying anyway and now you've lost three people or more simply trying to prevent the inevitable you're going through.

Speaker 6:          03:26:11       So at night when we're told the no man's land area comes to life and you know, we're appears deserted during the daytime. At night, the trench patrols go out. The people who you know fix the barbed wire, the intelligence folks, the people conducting trench raids. I mean supposedly there's a lot of activity in the dark. Even though star shells light up the sky all the time at dark graves in his unit moves out to go cleared any wounded in front of their trenches. And he writes, quote at dusk. We all went out to get the wounded leaving only centuries in the line. The first dead body I came upon was Samson's hit in 17 places. I found that he had forced his knuckles into his mouth to stop himself crying out and attracting any more men to their death. And to quote, so this poor man out there hit 17 times suffering, horribly unable to keep from crying out, can't stand the thought of attracting anymore and men to rescue him and dies with his hand in his mouth to keep from crying.

Speaker 6:          03:27:16       I mean it, it, it's, it's the beauty that, that, that finds its way into the horrific ness of this war. If you're that person's parent, there's nothing to consoles you that doesn't make you feel any better, but as a human being, you look at that and say, there's something about that man's sacrifice that's beautiful. Now graves tells another story, which not only shows the heroism and the beauty of one of his compatriots, but the same sort of an attitude on the part of the people. The British thought were the bad guys. The Germans, as we said, the Germans had been holding their fire quite a bit. You know, during this battle and you see it on the French side. And the British side too. I mean this is not abnormal. It's a little bit like that Christmas truce we talked about in the 1914, a era of this war were spontaneously troops got up and sort of gave each other a little Christmas love in between the shellings, right. You see this humanity appear even in this hell. Graves talks about another soldier in no man's land who wakes up in a seemingly dead and then all of a sudden is crying for help, and when this happens, every man in his trench feels like he's going through some sort of a moral tasked and one man passes it with flying colors. Graves writes quote,

Speaker 6:          03:28:38       on the morning of the 27th, a cry arose from no man's land. A wounded soldier of the middle sex unit had recovered consciousness. After two days, he lay close to the German wire. Our men heard it and looked at each other. We had a tender hearted lance corporal named Baxter. He was the man to boil up a special dixie for the centuries of his section. When they came off duty, made them a little soup or tea. As soon as he heard the wounded Middlesex man, he ran along the trench calling for a volunteer to help fetch him in. Of course, no one would go. It was death to put one's head over the parapet. When he came running to ask me, I excused myself as being the only officer in the company. I would come out with him at dusk. I said, not now. So he went alone.

Speaker 6:          03:29:23       He jumped quickly over the parapet and then strolled across no man's land, waving a handkerchief. The Germans fire to frighten him, but since he persisted, they let him come. Close. Baxter continued toward them and when he got to the Middlesex man stopped and pointed to show the Germans what he was at, meaning what he was up to. Then he dressed the man's wounds, gave him a drink of rom and some biscuits that he had with him and promised to be back again at nightfall. He did come back. Graves writes with a stretcher party and the man eventually recovered. I recommended Baxter for the Victoria Cross being the only officer who had witnessed the action, but the authorities thought it worth no more than a distinguished conduct medal and the quote

Speaker 6:          03:30:07       sounds worthy of a Victoria cross to me, and that's one of those incidents where you see the opposite of man's inhumanity. Demand in an environment designed to foster the former. It stands out all the more, doesn't it? That baxter could have easily been mowed down and if you don't think it happens. Remember three people were mowed down trying to say that wounded Samson character in the first graves story, I can't help but wonder how my generation would handle what these people forced to do. You think of the first day on the battle of the somme. Think of yourself in the second wave or the third wave and you hear all this stuff from the officers about all the artillery will destroy everybody that nobody will be left alive, and then the first wave in front of you units that you know go over the top and don't even get near their objective before they're cut to ribbons.

Speaker 6:          03:31:01       It's an absolute catastrophe and screw up and everybody can see it happening and then they turn into the next wave. Maybe that's not you. Maybe you're in the third and tell them to go do the same thing and they do in the same thing happens, right? It's suicide. Now they turn to you and they say, okay, it's your unit turn. What do you do? Forget cowardice for a second because there are people who simply ran away or who's nerves failed them or whatever. This is not a question of, you know, what could you do physically? This is a question of what would you do?

Speaker 6:          03:31:36       See, I think a lot of us would think to ourselves, there's no way I'm surviving going out onto that battlefield, but if this officer wasn't here telling me to do this and my buddies and I just sort of decided all together, we're not doing this. Maybe something would change. You know, one of the first war novels to come out of the first world war actually came out during the first world war from a Frenchman named Henri barbless, and he wrote something where he as a soldier had served already. He was a disabled veteran. He wrote this piece while the war was still going on and it's surprisingly antiwar for the government to have put up with it during the conflict and he implied that the soldiers on both sides, the common soldiers should just agree with each other that they're not going to fight anymore. You know what? If they gave a war and no one came, right? What if the soldiers on both sides say, well, the government's can tell us to fight, but we're not fighting anymore. And Barbara said that in the book that the truthfully the only people who really understood what the French soldier and the British soldier we're going through in these hellish conditions where the German soldiers on the other side of the no man's land living under the exact same hellish conditions.

Speaker 6:          03:32:47       When the Germans don't fire on the British who are getting their wounded and a lot of times just because there's this unwritten deal that says, I'm gonna, leave you alone right now to get your wounded people out of there in the hopes that when it's my wounded people in no man's land and I'm trying to get them out of there, you'll let me. One of the real phenomenons of this war

Speaker 6:          03:33:10       is the fact that when left alone, a lot of soldiers on both sides decided to adopt what's what's officially known as a live and let live attitude in this war and it was. It was common everywhere, but the western front more than any other where for example, soldiers would be required and they hated this job to go out at night and put more barbed wire up in the middle of no man's land. So you sneak out because it's dark and you bring wire with and wire cutters and all these things and you have to go hang new wire. It's an extremely dangerous job in both sides. Hated it. Right? So a lot of times they just wouldn't shoot. At the other people who were putting wire up, now the officers hated this and one of the big scandals was after the Christmas truce, the so called Christmas truce in 1914 when both sides would have fraternized. The officers had to make all these arrangements so that next Christmas, nothing like this happened again, and the men had preserved a proper fighting spirit would be the way most of these militaries would phrase it, but the troops often found a lot more to like about each other than their own officers.

Speaker 6:          03:34:14       Corporal Louis Bartos in the French army writes about this incident where a flood occurs and all of a sudden the trenches on both sides of no man's land have to clear and how you have one of those moments where you just look at your enemy and he looks at you and you realize the socks and who put us into this mess and why are we doing this? And he almost writes, you know, Martez is a socialist. Like a lot of these troops in the trenches are. So he has a worldview that kind of sees the upper classes, the corporate groups and all that is the problem and that the average soldiers in the trenches, we're all just kind of common workers being exploited by the man and he writes about this famous a flood that he experiences and what it does and how it freaks out, you know, in his mind, the upper classes in the officer corps that all of a sudden, you know, both sides in this combat are starting to have some sympathy for each other. And he writes quote.

Speaker 6:          03:35:11       But one night when the rain came down in torrance, the tide invaded our dugout and cascaded down both sets of steps at the height of the storm. Some of the men had to devote all their efforts to building a dam, which the water then broke through in three or four places. We spent the rest of the night battling the floodwaters. The next day, December 10th, at many places along the front line, the soldiers had to come out of their trenches. So as not to drown. The Germans had to do the same. We therefore had the singular spectacle of the two enemy armies facing each other without firing a shot. Our common sufferings brought our hearts together, melted the hatreds, nurtured sympathy between strangers and adversaries. Those who deny it are ignoring human psychology, French, German, and Germans. He writes, looked at each other and saw that they were all men.

Speaker 6:          03:36:02       No different from one another. They smiled, exchanged comments, hands reached out and grasped. We shared tobacco, a canteen of coffee or wine if only we spoke the same language. One day he writes a huge devil of a German, stood up on a mound and gave a speech, which only the Germans could understand word for word, but everyone knew what it meant because he smashed his rifle on a tree stump, breaking it into in a gesture of anger. Applause broke out on both sides and the international was sung. He says the national anthem of the socialist cause I guess you could say the workers, cause he says, quote, well, if only you'd been there. Mad King's bloody generals, fanatical ministers, jingoistic journalists, Rear Echelon Patriots to contemplate this sublime spectacle. But it wasn't enough. He says that the soldiers refused to fight one another. What was needed was for them to turn back on the monsters who were pushing them, one against the other, and to cut them down like wild beasts for not having done so.

Speaker 6:          03:37:06       How much longer would the killing go on? Meanwhile, he says, our big shot leaders were in a fearer. What in the Lord's name would happen if the soldiers refused to kill each other? Our artillery men received orders to fire on any assemblies of men which were pointed out to them and to mow down indiscriminately, both French, German, and Germans. Just like when an ancient circuses, they slaughtered wild beast too. We're too intelligent to tear each other's throats out and devour each other. Furthermore, he says once the front line was established, again, for better or worse, it was forbidden under penalty of death to leave the trench. Any active familiarity with the Germans had to cease. It was over. What was really needed was a second biblical flood, a universal deleuze to stop the war, to appease all the anger and the bloody madness of our leaders. Who knows? He says, maybe one day in this corner of law, they will raise a monument to commemorate this spirit of fraternity among men who shared a horror of war and who were forced to kill each other against their wills and quote, there are multiple accounts from socialists, soldiers that sound like that, but it's more complex than that, and Philip Gibbs tries to make this statement and now it can be told where he talks about this horrible life. These poor soldiers are forced to endure, but then about the complexity involved in trying to make some statement that the soldiers are all of one mind or viewpoint about anything

Speaker 6:          03:38:36       we told you. Ernst, Young, or the German goes through all this terrible stuff and kind of finds it uplifting. Gibbs writes these horror stories and then says this about the psalm and the soldiers, their quote,

Speaker 6:          03:38:50       but however deep the knowledge of tragedy, a man would be a liar if he refused to admit the heroism, the gallantry of youth, even the gaiety of men in these infernal months. Psychology on the somme was not simple and straightforward. Men were afraid, but fear was not there dominating emotion except in the worst hours. Men hated this fighting, but found excitement in it, often exultation, sometimes an intense stimulus of all their senses and passions before reaction and exhaustion. Men became gibbering idiots with shell shock as I saw some of them, but others rejoiced when they saw our shells plowing into the enemy's earthworks, laughed at their own narrow escapes and at grotesque comma, calories of this monster is devil tree. The officers he writes were proud of their men, eager for their honor and achievement. The men themselves were in rivalries with other bodies of troops and proud of their own prowess. They were scoring full of all that the enemy might do to them. You get acknowledged his courage and power. They were quick to kill him and yet also quick to give him a chance of life by surrender and after that we're nine times out of 10, chivalrous and kindly, but incredibly brutal. On the rare occasions when passion overcame them at some tail of treachery,

Speaker 6:          03:40:07       they had the pride of a skilled laborer. He writes in his own craft as machine gunners bombers, raider trench, motor men, and we're all keen to show their skill, whatever the risks, they were healthy animals with animal courage as well as animal fear, and they had some of them, a spiritual and moral fervor which made them risk. Death to save a comrade or to save a position would have killed the fear that tried to fetter them or lead men with greater fear than theirs. They live from hour to hour and forgot the parallel or the misery that had passed and did not forestall the future by apprehension, unless they were a sensitive mind with the worst quality men might have in modern warfare,

Speaker 1:          03:40:50       imagination and to quote well, imagination. I can see being a downside if you are in the trenches under fire, you know, looking at your watch as some of these troops in the trenches did. Saying I have 15 minutes left to live. Now I have 10 minutes left to live. Now I have five minutes left to live as the countdown to going over the top happened. Yes, I can see how that would drive you crazy. On the other hand, we're getting to the part of the war were the really imaginative minds can begin to start to have an impact on these brand new 20th century problems. It only became apparent about two years ago when this war started. Some of the solutions to the problems. The first world war you know, brings into play debut during the battle of the Somme and they look once again, this is going to make me be a sub theme of the show unintentionally.

Speaker 1:          03:41:45       They looked like something out of science fiction in this case, hg wells or if you want to believe some people go all the way back to Leonardo Davinci. People who first come up with the concept of if you will, a land ship, Churchill and the navy called them land battle ships. Sometimes we know them by the term tank on tank is supposedly simply something that caught on. It was supposed to be a cover word so that no one knew what was being worked on in secret in the laboratories of the allies. They would suggest that this giant armored tractor was intended to bring up supply. You know, like water to the front line, troops under fire, so a tank if you will, a water tank on a battle, one of these little battles that make up all these giant battles, a part of the battle of the Somme on September 15th and offensive to take a particular part of the battlefield is launched and debuting are a bunch of these tanks, you know, 30 or 40, something like that. A bunch of them broke down on the way.

Speaker 1:          03:42:58       You can instantly see that this is the solution to the problem, right? If you go to your engineers when the war starts and say, listen, we've got this barbed wire machine gun artillery situation with no man's land and these big trenches, you got to get past a. put your mind to it. Come back with a design they did. They've got a giant tractor and it's so long that it can span most of these trenches so it can go in and not get trapped. Most of the time it only goes about the speed of a walking human being, but the point isn't to, you know, drive around real fast everywhere. The point is to not get killed while you're crossing no man's land and not get held up by barbed wire. These things are designed to simply run over barbed wire machine. Gun Bullets won't hurt them, shrapnel won't hurt them and they'll get to the other side and they'll wipe out strong points and when they debut, nobody has any idea what that's going to be like. It's another one of those moments where you kind of bite your nails and you watched the new technology in this case, not stuff developed in the last hundred years that never had a chance to be tested. In this case, stuff developed specifically in response to problems. The first world war you know, brings up like no man's land and they perform astoundingly well.

Speaker 1:          03:44:17       Now they break down a lot and they're terribly uncomfortable for the people inside. These are large too. There's like 15 people in these things. I mean they're like almost a boss and they don't have a turret. They have either a machine gunner coming under the side or a couple of six pounder guns, which are about 57 millimeter, and yet the Germans don't know what they're dealing with here, and we'd have stories of them surrendering the tanks and, uh, the reaction on the part of the British troops is either really excited and happy or they almost laughing because it looks kind of comical, but in a sense, this is what we talked about earlier. This is the star wars team punk imperial Walker thing for real

Speaker 1:          03:45:00       now, Churchill and the people who had backed this idea from the time trench warfare got started. That's when the first plans were drawn up in the ideas brainstormed for something like this in the French were working on a two by the way. Churchill was mad and forever afterwards yelled and screamed that this concept could have really done a ton if they had just waited till there were enough of these land battleships, um, to unleash and have, have it make a difference. The counterargument, which we also understand, right? Is that what if they don't work? What if we don't know how they work, how do we do this if we don't have a dress rehearsal before opening night, so churchill and the people on his side are saying, no, you wasted it. It should've been one big opening night that broke the western front and the other side saying, are you kidding me?

Speaker 1:          03:45:45       There is an open invitation and Murphy's law, but if you were looking to try to decide how you liked your land battleship concept in practice after it was debuted at the battle of the somme, well, all you have to know, his cavalry commander Douglas Haig, radioed back to corporate headquarters into the British army and said, we want more of those tanks now. Other things happened because of the battle of the somme. Two and one was it was just it for poor Eric von Falcon Hein, the head of the German military. Remember he's a guy who took over after they sacked von Moltke, the guy who they started the war with and now like a bunch of leaders who own a football team and continually like to change coaches. Falcon Heinz going to lose his gig. He's got verdun on his scorecard, now he's got the song and then there's this bruce law of offensive and then the last straw is everybody's whispering that Romania is going to get in the war, which doesn't sound like a big deal to us now, but if you actually look at the literature, especially German Austro-hungarian, the stuff from that side of Europe, oh, they're really like biting their nails about this.

Speaker 1:          03:46:54       Romania could get in the war. Half million bayonets. Oh my goodness. And everybody's really worried. And apparently Kaiser Wilhelm, the German emperor is really worried in fucking hindsight now. Don't worry about it. They're not going to come in anytime soon. Maybe later, but no, but no time soon. And then boom, almost right after he issues the, they won't be coming in. They come in August 27th. Uh, and that's it. Fall behind. Get sacked.

Speaker 1:          03:47:18       The last card, by the way, I love how he knows his emperor William and William's little quirks about power and Falcon Heinz last car that he plays is, you know, if you replace me with the people everyone knew they were going to replace it with. If you replaced me with Hindenburg and Ludendorff, that's it. They're not gonna. Listen to you. I'm the last chance you have of having an influence. My words, but that's basically what he said to the Kaiser. You wouldn't have any role in this at all. You better stick with me because if you put Hindenburg and Ludendorff in charge, they're going to tell you to go play with your toys in the corner. Apparently the kaiser felt like he had no choice. Sacks, Fond Falcon Hein, who asks for a military command is given. Some people think almost as an insult, the command to go attack Romania, which he didn't first see them coming into the war.

Speaker 1:          03:48:05       He takes over a military command and conducts a brilliant campaign against Romania. Conquering them quickly, which makes you turn around and go, now, why were we so scared of those Romanian bayonets? It's not the Romanians fault, by the way, folks. I mean, think about how that's like a minor league team jumping into the middle of a game against the perhaps army in the 20th century. So finally Romania. So unequipped for this without a ramp up period. And they just got smashed and the worst part about the whole thing from the allied standpoint, again, the allies worked so hard to get Romania in. The conflict is that one's Germany takes over Romania, they're gonna lose that country of every bit of wheat and oil and anything they can take to offset the damage that the British blockade is doing. So in a sense it's like they come upon this Romanian store room and they loot the whole thing so it sort of backfires on the allied cause. Nonetheless, Hindenburg and Ludendorff, this new command team, the people who had been in charge on the eastern front for so long and sort of being the armchair quarterbacks from over there telling the rest of the German command what they were doing wrong on the western front are now in charge of among other things the western front and they're going to bring a new perspective and a different way of looking at things and they will essentially command this German army for the rest of the war.

Speaker 1:          03:49:32       Now, how long the rest of the war is going to be able to go is an open question. As 1916 begins to wind up, you begin to see the discontent ramping up everywhere and on many different fronts. When you begin to see, for example, hunger really bite, there'll be a winter, the famous winter of 1916 in Germany. That's called the turnip winter, which tells you right there what's going on and all the. All the exports from Romania you can get aren't going to, you know, make up for the overseas important needs of Germany.

Speaker 1:          03:50:04       The Russians are in terrible trouble. Remember, this is a regime that almost got overthrown 10 years before this time period. They didn't have exactly the greatest, most solid foundation anyway. These million casualties, they suffer in 1916 at the Bristol off offensive. Among other things are taking its toll. French soldiers are beginning to bleed like sheep. When they pass by their officers, these replacements will come up marching by and they'll just hear bleeding. Sounds like sheep and lamb being led to the slaughter as sort of as one author puts it. I'm way that the troops can silently protest what they feel is being done to them and on the home front you can, you know the tragedy is beginning to really seep in as more and more people are personally affected for life by this conflict, and obviously while this isn't the textbook example, I don't think most people find themselves in in the same situation as this German couple, but there's a story from the time period from a British observer in Germany during the war who was describing a train trip where she saw a couple man and a woman on the train and the stories absolutely heartbreaking, but in so many ways shows where we are.

Speaker 1:          03:51:24       By the end of 1916 in this conflict, the observer says, quote, how poor woman the other day on the train was holding up her hand and counting the fingers on it. Slowly, one, two, three, four, five. Over and over again, the passengers gradually began to smile at her until at last, the man sitting next to her said, simply don't laugh at my wife, Ladies and gentlemen, I'm taking her to the asylum. Her wits are gone. She's lost her five sons all killed in action and quote, when you really examine what's already happened since August 19, 14, you come away with the feeling that if you had bet on a short war like so many did, you are amazed at the staying power of all these states, many of whom didn't look that particularly stable when the war broke out. Nonetheless, as we've been saying throughout this whole program, there's a limit to the endurance of anyone and we're about to enter the point when nations crack and break and in the not too distant future get knocked out.

Speaker 8:          03:52:46       If you think the show you just heard is worth a dollar, Dan and Ben would love to have it. A buck a show. It's all we ask. Go to Dan Carlin.com for information on how to donate to the show.

Speaker 1:          03:52:58       One of the justifiable criticisms you can level at the show we just did was that it focuses in ordinarily on the western front.

Speaker 1:          03:53:08       I did that on purpose because to me, when you're talking about the extremes of human experience, the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of the first world war is the situation on the western front and the trench war and all that, and in that sense I'm not that different than most British, French and German historians who have focused inordinately on the western front, but I think we all know that there's a lot of other things going on in this conflict in a bunch of other theaters and in the same way I was able to avoid talking about those other theaters for awhile. My goodness, the jumping around. We would do if, if we try to get everything in there would be more confusing than what we're already giving you, which is more confusing than I like already. Nonetheless, you could ignore her just like most people in Britain, France or heck, even in New York City. In the United States, when you open up a newspaper and in the far corner of like page eight, there's a little blurb about maybe some obscure Arab tribe uprising in some. Out of the way, autumn in district or something doesn't mean that much to you. You're not thinking that much about it. After all, the western front is grinding up a whole generation of Europeans and then in 1917 events in faraway peripheral places is the way a lot of people in the West might see them rise up and demand to be taken seriously,

Speaker 1:          03:54:28       whether it's the Middle East in 1917 and events that we are still shaking out to this day that are in your headlines daily, whether it's the collapse of an ancient European regime which opens the door to the 20th century's most radical regime taking over in a major country. So also in 1917 that the vortex of the first world war manages to suck in an outside major power. That for almost a 150 years has managed to stay out of direct involvement in European affairs. As one of their early presidents had said, the United States of America doesn't go abroad in search of foreign monsters to slay. And in 1917 they decide we'll maybe just this once, you know, to make the world safe for democracy. Yes, indeed. Many of our modern situations had the seeds for them planted in 1917. And we'll get to all that and more in part five of blueprint for Armageddon.
