Speaker 1:          00:00:00       What's you're about to hear is part five of a multipart series on the first world war. If you haven't caught the earlier episodes and you want to know what's going on, it might be worth your time to go back and listen to them. If you've already heard them or you don't care about stuff like that, then please join us for part five of blueprint for Armageddon,

Speaker 2:          00:00:20       be some bus seven, 19, 41 date which will live in infamy.

Speaker 1:          00:00:30       It's

Speaker 2:          00:00:36       perfect.

Speaker 1:          00:00:38       The events,

Speaker 2:          00:00:46       the figure out, Lord, from this time and place I take pride in the words, been the Alina tear down. Welcome this kind of examination because people have got to know whether or not their president question, well, I'm not a crop. If we dig deep in our district and our I don't remember, but we are not descended from fearful of man.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       It's hardcore history.

Speaker 1:          00:01:36       Earlier in this story, we brought up the often quoted phrase that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, and we brought it up in relation to the man who actually launched the incident that sparked the first world war, the Serbian nationalist Gabriela apprenticeship who killed the heir to the Austro-hungarian, thrown the archduke Franz Ferdinand, thereby precipitating the crisis that actually started the war. The austro-hungarian saw apprenticeship unequivocally as a terrorist is Serbian nationalist brethren revered him. In fact, not that long ago, a statue was unveiled in, sorry, Eva, where the assassination happened, honoring the assassin. So your view of the motives of these people really depends on, you know, who's doing the viewing at the time. Print chip is far from the only figure in this story who falls into a similar category. The United States is dealing with one themselves. In 1916, for example, in January of 1916, just as the German military is putting the finishing touches on what will become the quintessentially horrible battle of Verdun, the quintessentially century style battle, the killing field created by mass artillery. The meat grinder that will be verdun the United States is attention is taken off European affairs by events going on in northern Mexico. Mexico has been convulsed by revolution since 19. 10. Northern Mexico often becomes one of these hot beds of unrest and instability, and in January 19, 16, gunman waylay a train in northern Mexico.

Speaker 1:          00:03:33       Now this is at the tail end of the era where train robberies are not uncommon, but these gunman aren't there to rob the train. In fact, as they go up and down the aisles, they leave the Mexican nationals, the locals alone, but they pull off every American from the train that they find. They find 16 to 18 workers. Employees have a US corporation operating in northern Mexico. They take these Americans off the train, line them up in front of the tracks, forced them to strip, and then execute them.

Speaker 1:          00:04:14       We know this because one of the Americans feigned death and got away and told his story. I believe he said that the bodies were also mutilated. This very well may have been an attempt to provoke a response on the part of theU , s government, and if so, the mutilation is just part of adding fuel to the fire, a little something to make the US government even angrier at this event and things had been escalating to this point in northern Mexico for some time groups affiliated with these same gunman had been attacking isolated Americans at murder. Here, a murder there, a rape here or there, but this was upping the ante significantly. Nonetheless, the maneuver accomplished nothing concrete of note, so a couple of months later in March 19, 16, this group of gunmen or outlaws or revolutionaries, if you're looking at it from another point of view up the ante again and cross the US Mexican border in strength more than 100 go after American interest on the US side of the border, culminating in that in an attack on a US city, Columbus, New Mexico. In the middle of the night, they roar through this town, shooting, looting, killing, and burning. 18 Americans will be killed. The town will be burned down and the bandits or terrorists or revolutionaries, depending on your point of view, will escape back into Mexico.

Speaker 1:          00:05:49       Now, as a side note, then as now, Americans are heavily armed people and those bandits paid a high price for, um, what they did that town, many more of them died than Americans died. Nonetheless, the idea that you were safe and protected within the confines of the US borders was shattered in a way that hadn't happened since the Apache wars in that region had ended 30 years previously, the attackers have Columbus, New Mexico. We're affiliated with a Mexican revolutionary leader known to history, not his actual name as Poncho via now via almost certainly wasn't in Columbus, New Mexico. He had been hurt not that long before, but these gunman were part of his men. And if you look at this superficially, there's a lot of similarities between Poncho via and Osama bin Ladin. Now, this is not said to insult Mexican folks who still in some cases revere Poncho via his memory, but it's hard to avoid that, at least from the American side of things. There are rough analogies that you can point to, for example, like Bin Ladin via had once upon a time been a friend, did the United States, someone we thought we could work with and use and an arm and train and help.

Speaker 1:          00:07:14       In fact, after that attack in Columbus, New Mexico when it was obvious that some response had to be put together, President Woodrow Wilson, the American leader, launches and expedition, a military expedition into northern Mexico, sends about 5,000 men across the border. There was a a, an official leader, but he wasn't the guy who actually lead things on the ground. The guy who led things on the ground was an American general named John pershing, who was nicknamed by the way was Black Jack and a year before to show you how close the United States had been divya at one time, the year before, pershing launches this expedition to go capture this terrorist Poncho via. He loses his whole family in a terrible house, fire. Pershing's wife and his little girls, they were little children, died in the fire, and as he was wallowing in almost soul crushing grief amongst the condolence letters he received was one from this Poncho via person that he would be chasing about a year later. There are a lot of interesting things that this expedition across the border shows, not just Mexicans, not just Americans, but European observers everywhere who all throughout this war have wondered what the United States is going to do and what their capabilities are. All of a sudden they have a US military force in the field to have a look at and measure up against the standards of early 20th century. And to be honest, the American endeavor looks like a disaster.

Speaker 1:          00:09:00       It doesn't look a whole lot different than efforts 30 years ago to the year that were launched to go after the last Apache leader to, you know, break off theU , s reservation system with 40 warriors and go into some of this same country that via and his men were hiding in. It looks like a very similar army. Just add some motor cars, which is what the US military was employing to give them some mobility and some airplanes that look like they were invented by the Wright brothers themselves. In fact, the pilots were trained in some cases by Orville and Wilbur Wright. That's how recent, you know, airplane development is and the US planes are so rickety and so new that none of them survived the first week or two of operation down there. One of the more interesting aspects to the US operations in northern Mexico to go get Poncho via is the US doesn't know northern Mexico in their maps are all wrong and so they have leading their army as scouts Apaches, and these Apache's include allegedly some Apache scouts who were amongst the Apache Scouts that hunted down Geronimo 30 years before. In fact, there's quite a connection to a lot of these people involved in this conflict. John General, John Black. Jack pershing was a junior officer trailing Geronimo. Thirty years before these events.

Speaker 1:          00:10:33       It's believed that Poncho via wanted to get the US to attack northern Mexico and bog them down in this insane country to fight in insane terrain, insane weather conditions, and thereby raise his standing amongst several revolutionary leaders vying for control of the instability in Mexico that had been going on since the 1910 revolution began, but if Europeans already had a stereo, typical view of the United States is a nation of cowboys and an army myered in an almost old west sort of approach. The expedition into northern Mexico to capture Poncho via did nothing to disabuse them of that stereotype to many European observers. It wasn't just a frontier army that the United States of America looked like they possessed. It was kind of a frontier mentality to go along with it, and one of the things that was really hard for European planners is that on both sides of the war, by the way, is that it began to look more and more like the United States was going to play this huge role in the war. But what did that even mean? The United States had never sent over lots of men to go fight in some European war. It was alien, the American experience, so would they actually do that? There were a lot of European observers that thought that even if the US got into the war, they wouldn't send troops. Americans don't do that,

Speaker 1:          00:12:04       and that's part of what makes that pre first world war. United States of America hard for modern Americans to understand. You know, if you know your grandparents, if you're lucky enough to have met your grandparents, you can explain them to other people. You begin to get a real feel for what they're about, even if they're very different than you are, but they're real. You can relate to them. The United States of 1916 is like a great, great, great grandparents. You can read all about it you want, but those people are different from you and you don't understand them and you never knew them. You never knew anyone like them. The modern United States of America is the most intervention is great power in the world. In 1916, it was the opposite and it had a long mythology connected to its very founding that reinforced the idea that that's the way American foreign policy should be before the United States could involve itself in the first world war. It had to somehow deal with this lasting legacy dating all the way back to, you know, pre-revolutionary days, but why don't you just start with the farewell speech of the first American President, George Washington, a speech that was re-read allowed once a year in patriotic fervor, a speech that told Americans to stay out of Europe's wars

Speaker 1:          00:13:30       in the middle of his goodbye speech to the American people in his resigning from public life. He said, quote, the great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is an extending our commercial relations to have with them as little political connection as possible. So far as we've already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith here. Let us stop. Europe has a set of primary interest, which to us have none or very remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent controversies that causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns, hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics were the ordinary combinations in collisions of her friendships or enmities. Our detached and distance situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course if we remain one people under inefficient government.

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       The period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance, when we may take such an attitude as well, cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected when belligerent nations under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us will lightly hazard the giving us provocation which we may choose, peace or war as our interest guided by justice shall council. Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why? By interweaving our destiny, would that have any part of Europe entangle our peace and prosperity and the toils of European ambition, rival ship interest, humor, or caprice. It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world and quote, when Americans revere those people like Demi Gods and that speech has re-read to American school children and re-read publicly once a year. On the anniversary. You can see that if you were an American who thought that the United States should enter the first world war, you have a lot of mythology to overcome a lot of ingrained ideological training.

Speaker 1:          00:15:49       Unless you think that those are revolutionary sentiments. You know from the beginning of a nation. A lot of times people are very emotional and sentimental and lofty and idealistic. When a nation is founded and that cools over time. Forty five years after Washington gave that speech, the current president of the United States, a second generation guy like George w dot Bush, kind of John Quincy Adams gave another one of these foreign policy speeches, coining a famous phrase that Americans would use ever since going abroad in search of monsters to slay the very antithesis of the idea that the United States government is going to use as the slogan to get the United States into the first world war. John Quincy Adams in the middle of one of his speech is dealing with what the country's foreign policy should be. Forty five years after Washington gave his speech said, quote, speaking about the United States here in the Feminine Pronoun, by the way, quote, wherever standard of freedom and pendens has been or shall be, unfurled there will her heart, her benedictions and her prayers be but she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy.

Speaker 1:          00:17:01       She is the well wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She's the champion and vindicator only of her own. She will recommend the general cause by the countenance of her voice and the sympathy of her. Example, she well knows that by once enlisting under other banners than her own were they even the banners of foreign independence. She would involve herself beyond the power of extrication in all the wars of interest and intrigue of individual avarice and Vienna ambition which assumed the colors and you serve standard of freedom. The fundamental maxims of her policy would insensibly changed from liberty to force the front lead upon her brows would no longer being with the ineffable splendor of freedom and independence, but in its stead would soon be substituted and imperial diadem flashing and false and tarnished luster. The murky radiance of dominion and power. She might become the dictate trust of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:17:57       She would be no longer the ruler of our own spirit. And to quote this kind of historical legacy of idealism, this mythology, if you will, that Americans had reinforced all the time, provided a natural counterweight for patriots to choose a side that seemed to be opposite of what patriotism normally implied in Europe. Patriotism was a key part of nationalism. It's the grabbing of the flag. Sometimes I'm pushing your nation's glory and and, and, and borders farther that was true in the United States to everybody's human. The same sorts of, you know, rallying cries, often work on Americans that work on other people, but you also had this refuge for people who were patriotic and who could take an anti intervention is position and couch it as much in the flag as those who were suggesting that real patriots, you know, joined up and fought the Spanish in Cuba.

Speaker 1:          00:18:52       For example, as Theodore Roosevelt, the former president of the United States in and volunteer for that Spanish American war know, kept taking the opposite viewpoint that the United States of America lived in a different time than those founding fathers and that real patriotism and real men would be ready to join. The first world war in the United States is looking like a coward by not being involved with theater. Roosevelt is not the president in 1916, but he's needling the guy who is a guy from the other party, a Democrat named Woodrow Wilson, one of the most enigmatic and hard to get your mind around figures in this story. And part of the reason that Wilson is so hard to figure out is because the historians don't agree, the majority of historians have always taken Wilson sort of at face value and portray him as one of the most, if not the most idealistic president in American history.

Speaker 1:          00:19:53       A guy who is so peace loving, he's virtually gone ds and a man who did everything he could to keep the United States out of war and to fight for this wonderful just fair piece afterwards. That's the sort of the the goodwills and I divided them into the goodwill Wilson and the Evil Woodrow Wilson in terms of how some historians see them. The other historical campus, smaller but very vociferous, very loud and growing. And those are the people who for a lot of domestic reasons, it should be pointed out, don't like Woodrow Wilson at all. And often you know, a scribe, sinister or venal motives for him doing what he was doing. And see a man who wanted to get involved with the allies who sought piece for his own vainglorious reasons, who was a schemer and a person who hid behind a mask that promised you know, idealism and peace, and there were German, for example, who were never falling for that story, that Wilson was some Bambi, deer in the headlights on the world stage and always thought that that was just a really good mask that his machiavellian scheming hid behind making him even more dangerous.

Speaker 1:          00:21:01       Right? His disguise was better. Nonetheless. I'm not going to wait as a fan of history into which Wilson I believe was the real Wilson, but look at how it adds to the uncertainty of the whole thing. What is this guy all about now? I personally think that the air of mystery that surrounds Woodrow Wilson makes him a more interesting character. I mean, he's a giant enigma that's quickly becoming perhaps the most important single individual in the story by the end of 1916. But you know, I didn't have to live with them to the people in this tale. He's not a character. He's a world leader. And what the United States does in this war might decide the conflict. So the stakes couldn't be higher. Winston Churchill writing after the first world war, he got a very interesting view on Wilson. It's hard to describe. You can see he's. He's.

Speaker 1:          00:21:52       He's walking on eggshells sometimes, but he says this guy, we didn't know anything about him. I mean, he comes out of academia basically, and he says, only in the American system do you get these people that can come from totally outside politics as complete unknowns. He goes, in Britain, such a prime minister would have spent years in the, in the House of Commons or what have you, you know, working their way up. They would be in the public eye the whole time. They would be a known quantity by the time they got the top job. He marvels at the fact that Woodrow Wilson is an unknown, you know, the most powerful man in the United States and quickly becoming the most important single figure in the war. Churchill writes about Wilson in all his strength and his weakness in his nobility, in his foibles. He was in spite of his long academic record and brief governorship and unknown and unmeasured quantity to the mighty people who made him their ruler.

Speaker 1:          00:22:46       In 1912, still more was he a mystery to the world at large writing with every sense of respect, it seems no exaggeration to pronounce that the action of the United States with its repercussions on the history of the world depended during the awful period of armageddon upon the workings of this man's mind and spirit to the exclusion of almost every other factor and that he played a part in the fate of nations in comparatively more direct and personal than any other man and quote. That's why we're talking about the United States so much in this episode, and one of the other parts of the Wilson story that are interesting is when you get human beings in positions of great power and authority, oftentimes their little quirks or idiosyncrasies or characteristics can make or break history. I mean, we all have little things about us that might be quirky or idiosyncratic, but because we're not in positions of and authority, they don't really make much of a difference.

Speaker 1:          00:23:47       If if adults, Hitler leaves the military after the first world war is a decorated corporal and goes and opens up a sausage shop in Munich, his quirks and idiosyncrasies and characteristics don't make a big difference on the world stage. You probably never hear about them. They only affect, you know the people he has contact with, but you take that same figure and you make them the iron fisted dictator of one of the Great Twentieth Century nations on the planet and all of a sudden that man's quirks and idiosyncrasies and characteristics can create a deadly holocaust. Now, Wilson didn't have those kinds of characteristics. At least I haven't heard that even from the evil Wilson camp, but he did have characteristics that impacted this whole situation. One was he was almost always convinced that he was right. No paraphrasing here, but he said something to the effect of once that he felt pity for people who had different opinions than him because he knew they were wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:24:42       You can watch the way he operates in government and he's a supremely gifted politician, but a lot of times those people are unwilling to let other men carry out their policies and their programs because they know they could do it better and you can see that from Wilson to after the war, the man is going to become the British prime minister. A guy named David Lloyd. George will have to sit by the French military leader on one side and the president of the United States on the other and he said it was like sitting between Napoleon on one side and that was the French leader and Jesus on the other. That was woodrow Wilson and Jesus was probably more the way Wilson saw himself is what George was trying to convey than the way others saw him. Negotiating with a savior can require a deft touch and Wilson's demeanor and sort of professorial air of superiority and that I'm always right.

Speaker 1:          00:25:43       Kind of save your air about him. Sometimes rubbed some people the wrong way and certainly influenced the way that Wilson handled things. And there were several big challenges to American neutrality that Wilson had to deal with and all we're especially acute in 1916. One involved American lives, the other involved American money and the last involved in American election start with perhaps the number one most obvious things, sucking the United States into the whirlpool, the vortex of the first world war. And it was something that was so obviously doing that you can feel the momentum even now reading the history books about this sort of slide into a war because the German's use of this thoroughly modern science fiction almost weapon. The submarine and the submarine was creating conditions where a couple of Americans here and there, every now and then we're dying on ships. Every now and then.

Speaker 1:          00:26:42       It was worse than when the Lusitania went down, which was a titanic like liner to a submarine torpedo. More than 100 Americans went down with that ship. How long would any nation put up with that? And the problem is is that the US would complain. It works something out with the Germans. Tensions would drop. And then a month later, month and a half later, boom, it happens again. It's like a sore that kept getting poked with a needle before it was able to heal and yet we'll send, kept making the conditions more and more impossible to fulfill. So those anti wilsonian historians who say, no, no, you misunderstand. Wilson was trying to create the conditions that the Germans couldn't help but violate and then get the United States into the war and then claim it was foist upon the Americans. For example, Wilson at one point in his administration with high minded rhetoric and speeches, was defending the right of an American passenger.

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       And remember Americans could travel on American ships or neutral ships and and, and, and at certain times the German's had had sworn they wouldn't go after those, but Wilson was defending the right of an American to travel on a British ship or a French ship, right? A belligerent ship and defending their right to travel on a belligerent ship, even if it was carrying munitions and defending their right to travel on a belligerent ship carrying munitions that also was carrying defensive guns on it. That could hurt a submarine. That's when the Germans would throw up their hands and say that to them. Wilson didn't look like an honest broker. That's the kind of guy you're going to trust with peace. I mean, look, he did and their attitude was he doesn't hold the British to any of these same rules. He's trying to hold us to.

Speaker 1:          00:28:25       The British had a blockade going. They didn't use submarines. They use minds and they would mind the North Sea and they create these zones where they would stop every line that they could get their hands on, make it go to a British port, search it, you know, decided was contraband and Wilson and his administration were pretty darn quiet about that. The occasional protest and nothing more to the Germans. This looked like rank hypocrisy and to anti wilsonian historians. To them, it looks like a perfect example to show that really these ideals that Wilson professed were very conveniently ignored when they ran against what he wanted. There were other complications that affected what he wanted to. One had to do with perhaps the, the most ancient of motivations of all economic ones. The United States was making a killing on the first world war by 1916, pardon the pun, and it began to affect its entire outlook toward the conflict. It's one of the longest term impacts, by the way, are the first world war that the results of which we live with everyday in our modern world, but it's sort of sinks beneath the radar. It's a lot easier to understand the submarine warfare question than it is the economic transfer of wealth from Europe to the United States. This war was so total in its stakes that these, the, the sides fighting it found no good reason not to spend every bit of capital. They had to win it.

Speaker 1:          00:30:00       When Britain started this war in 1914, she was the richest country in the world. It was not long after the era where the phrase the sun never sets on the British empire was in vogue. The British empire controlled directly or indirectly about a third of the planet. She was wealthy and she'd been sucking up a lot of the wealth of Europe for 100 years. During Europe's most dominant time period on the world stage. The era of colonies and Post Napoleonic splendor, right? The Victorian Age, and yet when 19, 14 started, the British didn't just have their own bills to pay in this most expensive of all human conflicts. They underwrote their dominions. The Canada's the Australia is the New Zealand's. They underwrote countries like Italy and paid for almost all their costs during the war. The Russians to it. A lot of other small powers. The amounts of money that we're changing hands.

Speaker 1:          00:30:51       I've seen so many different attempts to come up with it. All you have to know though is it's ungodly. At one point it was like $75, million dollars a week in 1916. Money. I mean it's, it's incredible. The wealth transfer and when Britain started buying stuff from places like the United States, when the war started, they used cash and gold. By 1916. We're talking about credit and debt and if you wanted to think of New York as being like a giant vacuum cleaner with the sucking hose and in London just sucking out a hundred years of civilizational wealth acquirement it's not a bad image in four years. The center of world banking as we sit in an earlier episode is transferred from London to New York, same thing for the center of World Trade, and all of a sudden by 1916, Wilson is acquiring a huge amount of power because the United States is the banker and these people are beginning to owe it money. The British realized that at the same time, historian justice don't key rights, um, about Wilson's new ability because he controls the purse strings of the allied side in this war to dictate any sort of outcome he might want.

Speaker 1:          00:32:13       He writes, quote, if Wilson desire to force the allies to the peace table, the opportunity had come and he knew it. On October third, 1916, a British interdepartmental conference noted the nation's utter dependence upon American munitions, steel, foodstuffs, oil, wheat, cotton, and lubricants. We're the United States to engage in economic reprisals. Britain's war effort would practically of the 5 million pounds sterling needed to prosecute the war reported a government economist John Maynard Keynes. Later that week, 2 million must come from North America, quote in a few months time claimed the treasury official, the American public will be in a position to dictate to this country on matters that affect us more nearly than them. And quote, the author continues, quote Reginald Mckenna, Chancellor of the Exchequer concurred with canes telling the cabinet. In late October quote, by next June or earlier, the president of the American republic will be in a position if he wishes to dictate his own terms to us and quote.

Speaker 1:          00:33:18       The author says, at the end of December, Mckenna told an American journalist that Wilson could quote, force the allies to their knees anytime in a moment. And quote the United States in late 1916 is like a bank in Europe and especially Great Britain who was the financial underwriter of the whole allied war effort. Basically owes is the bank money that gives the bank a lot of power, but there's an old line in banking that if you owe the bank a little bit of money, it's the bank who has the power. But if you owe a bank a lot of money, that power goes back to the person that owes the money because the bank now has a vested interest in seeing that that person survives so that they can pay them back. The United States is beginning to worry about what happens if we can't sell this war material anymore, or if we can't get paid for the credit, we're loaning out.

Speaker 1:          00:34:13       The US has had a very uncomfortable sort of prosperity descend on it in the past two years. In 1914 when the first world war breaks out, the American economy is not doing well at all. By 1916, halfway through the year, the American economy is humming along nicely. Thank you. Some historians have actually called the United States a nation of war profiteers. At this point, if if Wilson was successful in, in creating a negotiated peace at the end of 1916 somehow, and you wanted it at that point, declare the winner in the first world war. Do you know which two powers I'd nominate it nominate Japan and the United States and the Japanese hardly fought in the war at all. And by the end of 1916, the United States hadn't fought in the war at all. Those are the victors. The Japanese get involved in 1914 for purely opportunistic reasons. They can take over all the German holdings in their neck of the woods and the Germans can't do anything.

Speaker 1:          00:35:08       So you get all this territory for basically nothing. The United States is selling stuff, amazing amounts of stuff. The both sides need everything in. The Americans will sell to anybody, but they can't get their stuff to Germany. They still made loans and tried to get stuff to them. But by and large, the British blockade had shut that down, but you could still trade with the British. And we did. And the idea that that trade might somehow go away, began to filter into the halls of government the prosperity that this war brought. The United States created another vested interest. And there are economic historians and historians who look more at, um, economic motivations for why countries do things that pointed this as the most important undercurrent of why the war was really going the way it was. Now, there's another reason too, and this is a very pedestrian, but woodrow Wilson in 1916 was an American president that faced an election campaign, and this is where the, the real uniqueness of the American situation has demonstrated what does the president do, who's running for reelection, and the big elephant in the living room situation is this war in Europe when he's facing an electorate made up of immigrants, of people on both sides of that conflict.

Speaker 1:          00:36:31       In the old world, historian David Stevenson does a great job breaking down, you know, the ethnic makeup of the United States and showing you all these weird problems that the United States would have if it got into this conflict that other nations wouldn't. For example, he points out that large chunks of the United States is made up of immigrants from some of these countries. The two main groups that are, that are problematic for anyone who wants to talk about siding with the allies in this first world war, our German Americans and Irish Americans. Here's what Stevenson writes, quote, support for American neutrality was strongest in the interior and especially the middle West where the German Americans were concentrated, of whom only an insignificant minority favored intervention on the side of the central powers of a US population. In 1910 of $92 million, he writes, two and a half million had been born in Germany and five point seven, $8 million had one or two German born parents in 1917, 522 German language.

Speaker 1:          00:37:36       Newspapers and journals were published in the United States. And German Americans were the largest ethnic group in Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. And quote, he then goes on to talk about Irish Americans who, and we didn't even get into this as, as a person of partly Irish American descent. I would have just gone off on, on the whole, uh, Irish uprising, the Easter uprising that happened, uh, during this conflict of which the Germans may have had a role. Uh, the British considered this an especially nasty stab in the bank back since it happened. During wartime reacted by killing a lot of Irish or it depends on if you're British or not, killing Irish leaders in the uprising, infuriating a Americans of Irish descent, of which there were a ton, and so if you're a politician like Woodrow Wilson, you have to deal with the fact that you have a ton of voters who were the only people that can keep you in power, who are really interested in not joining the side of the allies maybe or anyone.

Speaker 1:          00:38:41       The slogan for the Nineteen 16 campaign that's most remembered on the Woodrow Wilson side is the one that said, quote, he kept us out of war and quote. That was a slogan that appealed to most Americans. Wilson's peace oriented Secretary of State, William Jennings. Bryan had said at one point that New York and the major newspapers want war. The rest of the country wants peace, and if you're an American planner, it's interesting how many times you can open up the history books and see references to the uncertainty of what these large immigrant descendant populations would do if the US joined the allied side in the war. If you have two point $5, million Americans born in Germany, what are they going to do when war breaks out or these potential terrorists, and so it became quite an interesting issue before the conflict involved the United States as to whether or not the United States was unified and the idea that it would go fight on any side in this conflict.

Speaker 1:          00:39:45       Now what do you do if you're one of these American figures, perhaps one of the top politicians who wants the United States to get into the first world war? What's your strategy for dealing with these Americans who don't want to go? Who Want to stay neutral? It may be a huge majority of the country during this time period. If you're a politician and you're used to sort of putting your finger in the wind and going in the direction that people want to go, but they don't want to go in the direction you want to go. You know? What's your strategy for dealing with that? The strategy of several of the top political figures in this period was to play the Super Patriot card and to accuse Americans who disagreed with the idea of getting into the war as being disloyal mean. Take for example, the former president Theodore Roosevelt in 1916.

Speaker 1:          00:40:34       Roosevelt is not running for president, but he's campaigning and helping the guy who is from his own party, the Republican that's challenging. Woodrow Wilson in the November 1916 elections. Now, Roosevelt is in an interesting position here. He desperately wants to get into the first world war. He thinks it's cowardly that the US is staying out. He has publicly slamming Woodrow Wilson from pillar to post for not wanting to get involved in the conflict. He compares him on the campaign trail to punch US pilot. In fact, he says Wilson's neutrality is worse than ponchos pilot. Remember Pontius pilot? He's the Roman official who in the Bible Sentences Jesus to be crucified. That's a pretty good political slam at the president, isn't it? But then Roosevelt makes a point to go after what at the time were referred to as hyphenated Americans. You know, people who had a hyphen between their description of their nationality, German hyphen Americans, Irish Hyphen Americans, Jewish Hyphen Americans, and there was a feeling amongst a lot of Americans that these people weren't real Americans, that they had conflicted loyalties and there was also this idea that you had to have 100 percent loyalty to the United States and any consideration with what the ancestral home might want was equivalent in Roosevelt's own words to being a moral trader.

Speaker 1:          00:41:59       And so how do you deal with the fact that you want the United States to do something that most Americans don't want it to? Do? You Slam as traitorous those who oppose it. Now Wilson was in a bit of a different position because not only many historians think, did he not want to get in the war? Maybe, but he certainly had a public persona of not wanting to get into the war,

Speaker 1:          00:42:22       but Wilson didn't like anyone who disagreed with them. And you can see Wilson's attitude about those who would oppose his policies even in peace time, in his response to a telegram he received from an Irish American. There's that hyphenation, right? Irish hyphened, American leader. In September 19, 16, a guy named Jeremiah O'leary and o'leary was telling Wilson something that's, that's perfectly logical. He's explaining to him that all of these moves that seem to lean toward the allied side of the war are going to be issues in the campaign, right? There's nothing controversial about that. O'Leary's cable said, quote, your foreign policy is your failure to secure compliance with all American rights. You're leaning and see with the British Empire your approval of war loans. The ammunition traffic are issues in this campaign and quote,

Speaker 1:          00:43:13       most American political figures would understand that. That's just someone from the opposition explaining that that's how the American political system works. There's nothing wrong with that, especially not in peace time. Wilson wrote back to Jeremiah O'leary, quote, your telegram received. I would feel deeply mortified to have you or anybody like you vote for me since you have access to many disloyal Americans and I have not. I will ask you to convey this message to them and quote. In other words, to simply oppose Woodrow Wilson's policies in peace time doesn't make you part of the loyal opposition. It makes you disloyal. What is a president who feels that peace time opposition to peacetime policies is disloyal? What's a guy like that going to do when it's no longer peace time? Well, here's a little preview to think about. We still have laws on the books that were currently enforcing and using in the war on terror that our president Wilson's response to critics who addressed him negatively in war time. Unless you think that this is an overreaction though or maybe misplaced

Speaker 1:          00:44:24       priorities, it's worth noticing that in late 1916, there are several belligerence in this who are most threatened not by foreign armies defeating their armies on the battlefield, but by their own populations collapsing from within morally or in terms of their unity and support for the government. In an era where more and more of the armies of these modern 20th century states could take a punch and stay on the battlefield fighting year after year, the Chink in the national armor for some of these states was proving to be the home front and nowhere by the way, do you see a better example of the sweeping away of the 19th century mentality than in how the Home Front is viewed? The Home Front of course as a shorthand word for the people back living their civilian lives and you know, supporting the war economy and helping to make munitions and all the stuff that helps support those troops at the front.

Speaker 1:          00:45:26       In the 19th century in Europe's more genteel sort of era, there were all sorts of peace conventions and laws of war meetings to do, to help spare civilians and keep them as far away from the suffering of war as possible. That was considered to be a civilization will advance. It's interesting and and telling I think to watch that sort of genteel peace time mentality crash into the rocks of reality that are the 20th century where all of those rules look like rainbows and Unicorns. I mean from another time we're gassing each other with know insecticide, human humic decide can we say that you design something you use to spray on human beings like their aunts, you know, there go the 19th century genteel conventions right there and the same applied to civilians. We have the Germans, you know, using zipline raids to drop bombs on, on British cities.

Speaker 1:          00:46:19       I mean there goes those 19th century conventions right there and the German bombers who do it, you know, site this idea that everyone's a combatant. Now if the home front is a legitimate target in total war, then so are the civilians going about their daily lives in places like Germany and Austria, Hungary. When the British cut off trade to those places, they begin to do the equivalent of put an entire nation or an entire alliance under siege. And one British official actually said, you know, what's the difference between, you know, putting the city under siege, which has been done throughout history in the civilian population in that, besides that he always suffers and putting a nation under siege. The British clamped down this blockade at the beginning of the war by the middle and latter parts of Nineteen Sixteen at Longterm Anaconda like strategy really begins to bite.

Speaker 1:          00:47:11       And part of the reason why is these societies are already straining to the maximum to just keep their militaries in the field. And I think it's easy to forget exactly what the strain on these societies, you know, was because you look at, we know we've often compared the size of these modern armies to what Alexander the great conquered the known world with back in, you know, the three thirties bce. Alexander the Great is a core in one of these modern armies. Listen to what a German army corps of which they had dozens in the army requires to sustain itself. Imagine an ancient economy trying to provide this. This is from a holder, her vague and his book on the First World War quote, the army consumed copious amounts of food and fodder, a single core of 35,000 soldiers monthly devoured 1 million pounds of meat, 600,000 loaves of bread, 189,000 pounds of fat, or he says 242,000 pounds of canned meat and 121,000 pounds of Marmalade.

Speaker 1:          00:48:21       And he says 73,000 pounds of coffee. It's horses. Her Irving says needed 7 million pounds of oats and more than 4 million pounds of Hay. The 18th army corps, he says, for example, estimated that it needed 1000 wagons extending for nine miles to haul. It's monthly allotment of bread. It's butchers slaughter at 1,320 cows. 1,100 hogs and 4,158 sheep every month. Taken as a whole. He says, the German army weekly demolished $60, million pounds of bread, 131 million pounds of potatoes and 17 million pounds of meat. No one in the government or the general staff he writes, had given serious considerations to such mammoth needs for a period of four years and quote no, no one saw that coming. Someone from the ancient world, I mean this could never have been sustained before the modern era, but sustaining it took all of those necessary foodstuffs out of the civilian populations mouths and they were beginning to starve because of it.

Speaker 1:          00:49:33       The winter of 1916, 1917 will be remembered by Germans forever as the turnip winter, and that's the winter where the hunger blockade really bit historian Eric Dorn. Burroughs writes, quote as 1916, turn to 1917 caloric intake, which had already begun to fall in late 1914. Sled, do about a third of prewar consumption levels, money connections, and the black market help the lucky ones, but even the upper crossed suffered. Now, quoting a noble woman, we are all gaunt and bony. Now. We have dark shadows around our eyes and our thoughts are chiefly taken up with wondering where our next meal will be. Bros continues, quote poor had almost disappeared from dinner tables in restaurants where crow was now served, milk was reserved almost exclusively for young children, butter and sugar could be purchased only in very small quantities. Eggs were rationed to two per person per month and turnips and Rutabagas had begun to replace potatoes and quote, Bros goes into a couple of reminisces from Germans about what those tasted like and then says, quote, inevitably, as nutrition levels fell, bodies to come to a variety of ailments like rickets, scurvy, dysentery, tuberculosis, and influenza. Estimates place the number of blockade related deaths by war's end at 730,000, which makes popular outrage, understandable and quote.

Speaker 1:          00:51:04       Now, as with everything in the first world war, there are historical dissenters who will challenge every aspect of what's known as the hunger blockade affecting the central powers. But nonetheless, the important thing to understand is that it. It creates a dynamic in this conflict that forces the German side to do something. They're the ones continually getting less food. Their adversaries, the British and the French do not have a food insecurity problem. That dynamic forces the Germans to do something to change their situation or they'll just strangled to death. I mean, if you're already living through what Germans are calling the turnip winter in 1916 and 1917, what are they gonna call the next winter of 1917 and 1918. You don't have to be a genius to see that you now have to do something to change the state of affairs.

Speaker 1:          00:51:58       German public opinion begins to demand it. Now I should point out that that just pretty much makes them the equal of all the other populations of all the other belligerent seemingly doesn't seem like anyone's particularly happy with the way their government is prosecuting the war, regardless of which country you're talking about, at least amongst the major states. In Britain at the end of 1916, there government falls and the new prime minister who arises is the very embodiment of what voters would vote for if they wanted to shake things up and get somebody different in there. His name is David Lloyd. George usually just called Lloyd George, Georgia. Feisty Welshman have a much more working class background than you normally see in these sorts of positions. Might be exactly what you know, the average dissatisfied with the way the war is going British citizen wanted. Now it is a little interesting that only a couple of weeks before Lloyd George gets the job, he's recorded as having said about the allies in Britain. We've lost this war and now he's in charge of Britain's war effort. It's also interesting to note that you could tell how up in the air, the outcome of the first world war is in 1916, where you can find leading figures on both sides who think their side has lost the war.

Speaker 1:          00:53:19       Nonetheless, the French also get into the game. Nineteen 16 has been a terrible year for them to just as it has been for the British, and they finally find the courage to get rid of their longtime military leader, the legend Joseph Jaffra. He's been living off the fumes of his reputation from the battle of the Marne. A long time, I think it's safe to say been underperforming and the French finally, they can't fire him. He's too much of a legend, but they finally sort of kick him upstairs and promote them to a ceremony of poster and replace him with the first new French leader since the war started, a guy named and he's Al the Russian population and public opinion, which isn't really supposed to have much of a sway, supposedly because they live in a, in a strange sort of autocracy with a part time legislature, um, but they're making their feelings known to more on that in a minute.

Speaker 1:          00:54:10       And in Germany, the population just wants a way out of this trap. Some people would like to see efforts made towards figuring out a way out of the war, which they have people who say this in all the belligerent countries, but you have to be careful. A little while ago we talked about Woodrow Wilson, suggesting that people who might oppose his policies were disloyal. He could get you thrown in the jails in a lot of these belligerent countries if you appear to be disloyal. So too much peace talk could get you in a lot of trouble. Nonetheless, there was a body of German public opinion that was pushing for another outcome. They wanted their government to take the gloves off, stop playing nice with the adversary. They wanted their government to unleash the submarines and to heck with what the Americans would do to some Germans.

Speaker 1:          00:55:01       The American policy looked to be a very conniving way to simply deny Germany the use of the submarines. If you make the rules too restrictive, and in the Americans case, the rule basically was that an American traveling on some ship gives it some magical protection simply by stepping on board. You can't sink that ship. Now there's an American on it that pretty much nullifies the submarine for Germany at all, but if that's the only way you see a chance to end the war with the German victory over the British, what does that mean? Can you let the Americans hamstring you like that? Added that. The fact that a lot of Germans don't really see the Americans is all that neutral already and think that maybe Britain could be defeated in four or six months before the Americans have a chance to do much of anything. Add to that. The fact that when public opinion veers in that direction, there are Germans in the military high command, a majority of them that were already thinking that themselves now they have public opinion on their side unleashed the submarines, but what if the Americans come in the war?

Speaker 1:          00:56:05       There were German leaders though that didn't like this choice, wanted to find another option rather than use the subs, get the United States into the war. Chief among them was the chancellor of Germany, the top political guy. His name was Beth manhole. Vague, and we've discussed him before. This is all, by the

Speaker 3:          00:56:24       way, very controversial, very complicated, very convoluted. You're getting the Dan Carlin a condensed, potentially unreliable version of this, but it's a fascinating time in the conflict because the politicians led by whole vig think they find a way to throw a monkey wrench into that terrible choice that the allies of sort of foisted the Germans on with the hunger blockade and everything else. They've got to make a move so they make a very unexpected one. On December twelfth, 1916, Beth manhole, vague and the Germans announced that they are prepared to enter into negotiations to end the war.

Speaker 3:          00:57:06       Now it should be pointed out that such calls for peace and discussions about peace had gone on since the war started. Woodrow Wilson had stepped up pretty much right at the beginning and said, I'll mediate anytime you want. There were attempts by both sides in the war to try to make a separate peace with somebody else and maybe get, you know, one of the allies of, of your enemy to drop out of the war, but those are peace terms just to get an edge in the conflict. They're not peace terms to end the war. The Germans were making the first apparently serious, certainly public offer to sit down and start talking about the issues that kept the conflict going. This was a huge shock, not exactly to the Wilson Administration. They'd been getting some information fed through some back channels that the Germans might be ready to do this, but the Americans thought that they were going to unleash this big piece proposal.

Speaker 3:          00:57:58       When the Germans do it, they preempt woodrow Wilson's version and he has to rush this out. You know, about a week later, a little bit miffed that the Germans stole his thunder a little bit, but all of a sudden in December 19, 16 after this horrible year, there were a piece proposals on the table and it puts everybody into a really uncomfortable position. Now the Germans had taken a real chance, by the way, by trying this peace proposal route. If this is a high stakes card game and I often think of the war and in terms like that, the Germans, because of the hunger blockade and everything else are forced to play a card and everyone thinks they're going to play that really high risk, high reward, dangerous card. They have the unrestricted submarine warfare card. Instead they play a potentially equally perilous card, but one that no one's expecting. They play the race card, but the peace card can blow up in your face if you don't play it.

Speaker 3:          00:58:46       Definitely case in point, what are your enemy's gonna? Think? When you become the first power to come forward and start talking about stopping the war, they're gonna. Think you need to. What's more? There's a danger. Your own people might think that too, and you spend a lot of effort in this war to stiffen their backbone and keep their resolve in place. How much are you going to undercut it if you become the first power to seek peace? So this whole thing has to be worded very carefully and it is, but almost in such a way to give your gift to give you as you're moving

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       your neck between the humanitarian side of the German chancellors proposals and the side, this filled with overwhelming hubris. The Germans talk about what this was doing to civilization and how they'd be willing to get into conversations about ending it, but that they're still invincible than they're gonna win the war and they don't need to do this and what would the terms be on the other side? Maybe you could say that allies, historians have argued about the motives behind this ever since, but the truth of the matter is, if you look at this like a card game, there were some good reasons for the Germans to play that piece card. Whether or not it was realistic and whether or not the other side accepted it,

Speaker 1:          01:00:03       and some historians say this was what it was intended to do the whole time. Provide some diplomatic cover for the start of the unleashing of the submarines to go and say, hey, we'll talk about peace. Then when it's rejected. Being able to turn around to your own people and say, you know, you better give up those hopes. Have an easy piece. We just tried. They won't do it. This is a fight to the end, stiff in yourself and also to show the world including the neutrals and including the people on the other side of the wars population that we're not the ones keeping this carnage going. It could have been over, but your side wants to keep fighting it. Most especially is an attempt to maybe influence public opinion in the neutral countries, especially the most important neutral country. The United States which has so many German Americans in it that there are more than 520 German language newspapers as we said. What do you think the editorials are going to be in those newspapers after Germany makes a peace proposal and the allies swatted down?

Speaker 1:          01:01:05       That's going to put some pressure on the US government to stay out of the war to and that's going to influence American public opinion over who the bad guys and who the good guys are. That may have been the overriding intention of this German piece effort, but nobody knows. It may have been a serious attempt to at least start negotiations going and to take a position that didn't make you seem to vulnerable at the outset. The Germans picked the right time to do it. It was right after the capital of Romania fell to the central power, so were they're negotiating from a position of strength here and the allies swatted down. They have to.

Speaker 1:          01:01:41       The problem with asking these powers to state publicly what their war aims are in order to create a piece is to show that the war aims of these powers have gotten so out of hand that they bear no resemblance to anything that could be negotiated as historian Gwynne Dyer road in as we may have quoted already on this program, quote, what the governments of Europe who found themselves trapped in the first total war discovered to their dismay, was that if the means used to fight the war, our total then so must be the ends. It was almost impossible to stop short of total victory for one side and unconditional surrender for the other and to quote the old territorial exchanges and the paying of reparations and the, you know, giving up or acquiring of colonies was a 19th century sort of war aim. It's sounded out of place in the 20th century. If the British or the French or the Germans or anyone had said that their was involved, a little change, a territory and a little reparations money or what have you, it would have seemed so out of proportion to the cost that there would be a real danger that the public would think that what the country was fighting for wasn't worth what the public was paying for it.

Speaker 1:          01:02:57       In addition to that, of course there were some craven territorial ambitions involved and no one wanted to state those. In fact, both sides had promised other people's territories to allies of theirs. For example, the Italians were promised territory from the Austrian Hungarian Empire. Once the war was over, the British couldn't very well say that was a war aim and still not look like cynical gamesman in this war. When everyone, by the way on all these sides is a cynical games win, but you can't show that to the public. What's more? The idea of war aims that stopped short of defeating the enemy unconditionally clashed with your propaganda. This is a war that's using such 20th century ideas as a war to end all wars and a war to make the world safe for democracy. It's not a war to acquire a few colonies on the Mediterranean and some oil in the Middle East and the breakup of the Austrian Hungarian Empire.

Speaker 1:          01:03:59       It's a war for these high minded ideals. The problem is as if your propaganda portrays the Germans as the second coming of the Hmong goals will actually, the huns is the word the propaganda used and they're baby killers and nurse executioners and none rapers and all the things that propaganda makes them out to be. How can you possibly sit down and sign a piece of paper to compromise with them and have peace again, when the Vatican was a at this time trying to help create the conditions where peace could happen. The Vatican kept telling the powers to live up to those prewar agreements to make war less horrible, and they were saying that they were favoring this not because they were idealists, but because if these powers kept doing everything in there, you know might to destroy one another. They were going to hate each other so much that there was going to be no space and mutual respect left to carve out a piece later, the Germans were no happier by the way to state their war aims publicly for the exact same reasons. Now, there was an implied threat included when the Germans came forward with this attempt to get negotiations started and the implied threat was if negotiations didn't happen in weren't fruitful, they would play the unrestricted submarine warfare card. The peace negotiations are over by the end of January, in the middle of January. Actually, we're on January 20th. Wilson makes a famous speech, a speech where he calls for peace without victory

Speaker 1:          01:05:33       in his so called Peace Without victory speech on the 22nd of January when essentially he already knew that it wasn't going to happen. Wilson lays down the kind of peace that Europe will have to broker to end the first world war. If it's to be a lasting peace. It can't be one of those pieces. You know where the knife is turned in. One side is left hating the other. When you think about how the first world war ended and how it's sowed the seeds for the Second World War, Wilson sounds like nostradamus was some of the things he says in this part of the speech where he talks about, you know, having to have this kind of peace. He says, quote, I am seeking only to face realities and to face them without soft concealments victory would mean peace forced upon the loser of Victor's terms imposed upon the vanquished. It would be accepted in humiliation, under duress, at an intolerable sacrifice and would leave a sting, a resentment, a bitter memory upon which terms of peace would rest, not permanently, but only as upon quicksand. Only a piece between equals can last only a piece. The very principle of which is equality and a common participation in a common benefit. The right state of mind, the right feeling between nations, it is necessary for a lasting peace, as is a just settlement, a vexed questions of territory or of racial and national allegiance

Speaker 1:          01:06:54       end quote, so he's not only calling for a piece where nobody can claim a victory. We just stopped fighting and begin negotiating for a postwar world in which Wilson and envisions a new international global structure to enforce global peace and harmony so that we never have a first world war. Again. As I said, for those historians who suggests that Wilson is out to make Wilson the biggest historical figure he can, that would be a heck of a legacy if he could pull that off, but instead, within a couple of months, the United States will be in the war and from the allied perspective, not a moment too soon. The end of 1916, early 1917, and we've been spending quite a bit of time setting this period in the war up, but this period in the war is probably the most important six months in the last hundred years.

Speaker 1:          01:07:58       People talk about the first world war is this transformative moment and the aftereffects that were living with, you know, even now all around us, but the most transformative moment in that conflict is what's about to happen now and you know, I can't help but find some sort of analogy approach to looking at it, but I mean it's like we have this tree and they've been shopping at it for two years and at the end of 1916 and finally the tree falls over. Winston Churchill says three ingredients acting together, create what he calls the second climax of the war. In this period we've dealt with two of those ingredients, the Americans and the submarine question. The third ingredient involves Russia. Up till now, I think it's pretty obvious in this episode we've been dealing with what you could safely call the first rate powers the countries that were at the top of everything when the war started.

Speaker 1:          01:08:53       The rich, powerful, cohesive, unified, you know, top of the Line States, the Francis, the Britains, the Germany's. But if they're worn down by this many years of this war to this point, to where they are now, where the Germans are undernourished, for lack of a more provocative term, what must be the situation that the countries that weren't first rate powers in the war started? The ones that had challenges and we're struggling in various areas. How are two years of war treating them? Well, the Italians have opened disagreements about peace in their government. Um, in, in the trenches, there are pamphlets distributed by socialists that say next winter, not another man in the trenches. The generals are not very pleased with that, but it's hard to blame the Italians. They were on like their 10th or 11th battle of the [inaudible] river fighting over this torture risk, mountainous terrain, which creates an environment.

Speaker 1:          01:09:54       You know, it's, it's a little teeny horrible war in and of itself with all these unique things. I mean, just to give you one example, in the mountain war that the Italians are fighting with the Austro-hungarian, when shells hit, they're all carved into rock. I mean, instead of trenches, a lot of times they have blown out like chasms for cover, but when the shells hit the rocks, the rocks just splinter, creating like a secondary amount of shrapnel. That's just horrifying. And then when you get wounded your way up at six, 7,000 feet and you got to be brought down through mountaineers, Alpine conditions to the nearest waystation, they, they still find frozen things up there. Even today, it's a horrible conflict and by 1960 and the Italians are on like their 10th or 11th version of it and all they have to show for it is more and more dead people.

Speaker 1:          01:10:39       They wouldn't be human if they weren't starting to get a little fed up with this. In fact, that just puts them on par with how it seems the populations of all the belligerent countries are doing now. How's Austria Hungary doing? Remember, they're the ones that you know, kind of where we're at. Ground Zero. When this whole war got started, they're the ones who had the archduke that got himself assassinated. They're the ones that sent that uncompromising letter to the Serbians. They're the ones that sparked this war. How are they doing? Well, I bet they wish they hadn't. They're in terrible shape. The venerable emperor that had ruled there for so long, the benign face of stability had finally died to be, um, you know, succeeded by the next emperor who's a much younger man and who looks at his country and says to the Germans, this war has to end in 1917 when Austria, Hungary is worse than done

Speaker 1:          01:11:30       this new emperor. During this coming year, we'll go behind the Germans, back to the allies reportedly and try to sort of sell them out and the Germans find out about it and then they're never going to take their eyes off Austria hungry again. All of a sudden, you know, these brothers in arms don't trust each other anymore. And it was a very interesting move that a lot of people have talked about. It's almost like world war one's version of Rudolf Hess flying to Great Britain, you know, to make a separate piece for Nazi Germany and the Second World War. It's just this weird little endeavor. And all it does is earn Austria, Hungary. Germany's Ms Dot Trust, and then you have the Russians. Now, the Russians from the very start of this war, even before this war for a very long time, have been this contradiction in power. In one sense, they are massively powerful in a military sense. Theoretically they are terrifying

Speaker 1:          01:12:25       and yet they are at the same time, so fatally flawed in the underpinnings that anything Russia's doing in this, we're always seems to be like writing some rail or or walking a tight rope and and disaster loomed at any moment. It just, it was an unsteady sort of situation. There's a story that sort of shows this, this contradiction in terms the military leader of the Russian military leader, bruce seal off. He'll have an offensive named after him in 1916. We talked about it nowhere near as much as it deserves in the last program. This once again, push the Russians out there in a good light, shows you what they can do when they get their act together and they are devastating. Seven hundred and 50,000 casualties on the Austria. Hungarian army, I mean essentially mortally wounded than it is frightening what the Russians can do, you know when things go the right way. But Priscilla of tells a story that shows you just how fatally compromised everything is. You know, how rotten the insides are. He says, at the height of this offensive, when everything's going so well, he's receiving unsigned letters from his own soldiers telling him that if the fighting doesn't stop soon, they're going to kill him.

Speaker 1:          01:13:39       Russia has been having internal problems for decades. Now. The current Tsar, Nicholas the second, uh, the czar desire is not even his right name. He's the emperor of Russia. The czar is the old name that goes back hundreds of years, but they still call them that because that's essentially what the office still is in his name, his official long title that says he's the autocrat. And, uh, even if the Russian doom has been given one percent and the czar still has 99 percent of the power, he's a, an example of the old world at its most royal. And yet he knows how frightfully fragile the underpinnings are. When he was emir adolescent, he saw his grandfather carried into the royal palace with his legs torn to shreds, his groin gone, his stomach ripped out, and his face mangled, and he is bleeding out on the royal carpet and the royal family, including Nicholas. The second, the man who will be Nicholas the second watch their grandfather die. It takes about 15 minutes

Speaker 1:          01:14:49       he'd been killed in an assassination. Another one of these stories where you know the czar is out in his bulletproof sled and I am a bomber. Throws a bomb. It sounds a little like the whole Sarah Gevo thing that kicked off the first world war. A bomber throws a bomb, the bomb goes off, kills people who are not the target. The target comes out. In this case, the czar comes out to look around and there's another bomber in the crowd. Supposedly desire at the time had said something about, you know, thank God that nothing happened. And the other assassins as he's throwing the bomb and him saying it's a little too early to thank God, boom. And he bleeds out in the royal palace floor while the czar who will be commanding Russia as the autocrat in the first world war as a 13 or 14 year old boy watches. He knows how dangerous the job is, and he knows that there's a violent current of rottenness that opposes his system and he's dealing with it all the time. One of the things that makes this story so interesting though is when you're dealing with one person with almost total power, as we said earlier, their little idiosyncrasies make a big impact on history. In the case of Nicholas, the second, the autocrat of all the Russians, right? His idiosyncrasies involve some things that I think most people out there who have children can at least relate to a little bit of.

Speaker 1:          01:16:20       It's interesting that there's a part to this story that just has a personal tragedy wrapped up in it. I mean, this is an example why you can't reduce history to some sort of mathematical equation or some sort of predictable set of rules are. I mean there are human beings involved here. In the case of the Tsar. It's a fascinating story. The man, just so you know, I mean this is how Europe was. This is the old Europe that's being destroyed. He's the first or second cousin with everybody. He's the first cousin with the King of England. He's the second cousin with the emperor of Germany. I mean he's related to everybody and his wife is the first cousin of the King of England. I mean a little incestuous maybe, but that explains why the czar and his wife more than her in a second, who only have one son give birth to a son who's a hemophiliac. It runs in the family Queen Victoria, who sort of the, the, the descended that all these people can trace their heritage back. You said that this did not run in her family, but it seemed to. Victoria of course was German and her roots, so it was the czar's wife has Arina Alexandra.

Speaker 1:          01:17:39       Both of them loved each other,

Speaker 1:          01:17:42       and I say this because you know, you would think today we'll. Of course they did, but listen, this is an era where, especially amongst nobility, you often had very political marriages. You also had these very old fashioned things that were very common back then where the husband and wife really didn't love each other and the husband was out, you know, with all the girls all at it wasn't like that with Nicholas and Alexandra. This is what this was a love story and it really was, and not just between the two of them but with their children too. They loved their children the way we think of every modern person loving their children or the way they should and that is not to say that people in the past didn't. Although you find a lot of examples in the royal families throughout history where the father hardly sees the son eight. It's not like that with these guys. They take an active day to day role in their parenting and they wrote letters to each other constantly and they wrote in English, which they both spoke. Well, this is our arena was German, but. But she spoke Russian. She spoke English, does our spoke everything and they communicated in more than a thousand letters with each other where you get a real feel for these people. And one of the things that they are absolutely terrified about is their son who's got hemophilia,

Speaker 1:          01:18:49       he's their only son, he's the czar and he is almost certainly going to die young from this disease now, just so you know, hemophilia is a disease where your blood doesn't clot. Not to get too technical because I couldn't explain it any way, but um, but basically any little cut or bruise has the potential to spiral out of control. The normal in a rough and tumble of a, of a young child's life will kill you. And in this era, especially, parents just assumed almost a death sentence. And these two parents, as any parents we would think of today probably could hardly handle that thought. And they were looking around for curious and trying to find them. And eventually they found someone who seemed to be able to fix their son. And because of the little idiosyncrasy connected to who this person tended to be, world history is completely altered.

Speaker 1:          01:19:47       And, and the funny part about it is an unknown. It's a tragic story. It's a, it's an interesting story. It's a very human story. But there are elements to it that would make a good sitcom or a good movie premise, and I, as I walked in to talk about this today, I remembered the movie that was kind of based on the premise that it had nick naulty entity was called down and out in Beverly Hills and the story is about a vagrant kinda homeless kind of guy who by hook or by crook ends up, you know, in living with a rich family in beverly hills, a really fabulously rich family. And of course because of the dichotomy in their lifestyles and the way they view the world, hilarity ensues, right? But that's Kinda what happened with the tsar and his wife and they're hemophiliac son when they found somebody who seemed to be able to heal him, that somebody was basically the equivalent of the vagrant in down and out in Beverly Hills. They were bringing a peasant in to have a look at their sick son. Peasants name is Gregory Rasputin. And history has always been. I mean, he's a hardcore history personality. If you've ever found one.

Speaker 1:          01:20:55       And the fact that this government was run 99 percent by one guy and his wife opens up the door to a greg gory Rasputin being able to have the effect on history. He had historian Peter Hart does a good job of of framing all the various things that seem to be going on at once, including what I just talked about, the the way Russia is sort of a giant, but hamstrung by this, this ancient system of theirs so that a guy like Rasputin could make a difference in the idiosyncrasies of a single individual or two could come to the fore. He writes, quote,

Speaker 1:          01:21:32       the Russian homefront was gradually collapsing under the intolerable strain of war. The czarist government did not have the flexibility necessary to cope with the plague of economic, political, and social problems that infected the land. The tsar himself perceived any form of democracy is a threat to his regime, and rather than introducing an increased measure of liberalism was more attracted to the idea of a total disillusion of even the tokenistic Duma appointments. Depositions of considerable authority. We're routinely assigned by the czar on the grounds of either naked favoritism or the authoritarian credentials of the candidate. Spy scares raged through society with particular suspicion falling on any Russian general, unfortunate enough to have a Germanic name. Meanwhile, incompetence and corruption blossomed unfettered while at the center. The tsar was publicly embarrassed by the adherence of the Zarina Alexandra to the ludicrous cult of Rasputin and unhinged religious mystic with a pension for irreligious pursuits. The whole despotic system of government was resting on just a few weak individuals. Russia was being hollowed out from within, and the vacuum at the center was creating dangerous instability and the quote now, everything that Peter Hart says right there could have applied to several other countries in this story. Everything except one thing.

Speaker 1:          01:22:57       The part dealing with recipe

Speaker 1:          01:23:00       Gregori. Rasputin is a great wildcard in the story and a quintessentially Russian figure. I mean, he's. It's hard to imagine him anywhere else and he is outrageous and larger than life. And I think Peter Hart has great historian as he is. He sounds a little bit like he can't understand, you know, the Zarina, the wife of the czar kind of falling for this guy and his shtick. He calls it the ludicrous Rasputin cult. I mean, if you'd have had her here to ask her, she'd probably say to you, but I saw him do it multiple times. Do what? Saved my son's life. If you saw somebody save your kid's life multiple times, don't you think it would be hard to have your logic override what you think you saw? I've seen cold hearted total realists turn into people seeking quack remedies when they were dying of cancer. They were looking for hope. If your kid is dying, you're looking for hope. What if somebody actually comes through? I mean, what if that quack treatment for your relatives, terminal cancer cured the cancer. That's the weirdness in this story that the royal family, the emperor and his wife, run into this Guy Gregory Rasputin first in 19. Oh, five

Speaker 1:          01:24:24       about 10 years before the time period. We are in the story and there's an entry by the czar in his diary. We met a man of God today and so starched this relationship between this person who was born, a poor peasant in Siberia, you know, uneducated, everything and his relationship with two of the most royal figures in the world. I mean, when you think of the king and queen of England, that's the level we're talking about, what the czar and Sarina imagine today's queen of England who has no power at all, picking up some person off the street who's almost homeless and not even a London homeless person. Someone from the sticks up in the north of England somewhere, some small town, bringing them in the palace and having them live with you for awhile and sort of questioning them on the state of things and what are the people saying and and Oh yeah, letting the minister medicinally to your child. It's a crazy story and the only reason Rasputin becomes important. You can hardly imagine him important in most of the other systems of government, but because Russia is so autocratic, if you capture the czar, you capture the country. Rasputin made the royal family emotional hostages.

Speaker 1:          01:25:36       Now, whether that was intentional or otherwise is debatable. Historians disagree. There are some historians, you think this is a person who thought he was a blessed man of God with these special powers to do, you know, religious oriented things and others say he's a charlatan and he knew he had the royal couple sort of emotionally blackmail, but there was nothing anyone could do about it. There's a great quote from the czar, you know, in the middle of the story with Rasputin where one of his advisors says something to the effect of you to get rid of this guy and the czar, his answer is, there's nothing I can do about it. And a lot of historians have always interpreted that to mean that the czar is basically saying he can't stand up to his wife. You know, that she wants him. And there's nothing that the czar can do.

Speaker 1:          01:26:16       He won't stand up to his wife. But you know, some historians have come out recently and said, you know, it could easily mean there's nothing he can do about it because there's only one person who can save their son's life. The heir to the throne, by the way, if you really believed that this Rasputin guys got you in a weird position between 19 Oh, five. When the czar and Rasputin first meet and where we are in this story right now, late 1916, Rasputin has been warming his way into the czars family pretty consistently. Not as circle of friends, his family, the czar. We'll have these get togethers sometimes it was him and his wife and his kids and Rasputin. Now there our back steps. Sometimes the relationship goes sour for awhile usually because Rasputin, who was a surreal misbehavior does something particularly outrageous, either embarrassing the czar, so much that that, that he does what his underlings are continually telling them to do and sends Rasputin a way or legitimately upsetting him. Nonetheless. Every time he manages to break the relationship breakup, I guess you could say with Rasputin inevitably, Alexi, his son, the heir to the throne will get sick again, necessitating a return of Rasputin. He's like a cigarette habit. You can't kick

Speaker 1:          01:27:32       now. This rescued and characters fascinating on so many levels. You know, you have to think you were dealt some interesting cards by fate to be able to parlay your gifts from his upbringing as a, as an uneducated peasant with no money in the middle of nowhere to where you are in the royal family.

Speaker 1:          01:27:53       And when you see a picture of him, you see a little bit of it. I mean, he was five foot nine inches tall, pretty normal. Um, he had dark black, oily hair parted in the middle, unkempt mustache, unkempt beard, interesting way of dressing. I mean, if you, if you had photo shopped his picture onto the back of any number of 19 seventies heavy metal albums, I don't think I would be able to look at the bands photo on the back and, and know that you did it. He would have fit in perfectly as the basis of any number of bands from back then. Heck, if he were a lead singer and you named the band after him, it would fit in on any lineup. You could think of it as a heavy metal festival winded. I mean, you know, this weekend only black Sabbath, iron maiden, motorhead and Rasputin, he had the most amazing eyes and you can tell because normally you can't tell from photos 100 years ago, you know, certain qualities of individuals. It just gets lost through the layers of, of, of fuzziness and black and white and all that. But if you catch the right photo of respite and he had to be hand to be caught just the right time, you can see what the eyes were like because they jump of the black and white

Speaker 3:          01:29:02       photo from 100 years ago at you. Even now the whites of his eyes were said by witnesses to be extra white and again, it kind of looks that way and some of the photos is eichler dazzle people to the point where we have multiple descriptions that all contradict each other. Some people say blue, some people say Brown. Some people say gray. Some people say multicolored. When you read about his sort of tick like way of walking, moving his nervous habits, the way he wouldn't talk for a while and then all of a sudden you get this, this stream of sometimes unrelated conversation spiced with sexual innuendos. I mean there's a part of you that thinks, I mean I just read a book on the late writer, a hunter, Thompson, they sound like in a room together. They would look like they were impersonating each other. Rasputin is a combination of a person who looks to be a very devout religious figure from Russia's Christianity and Orthodox Christian, um, and a drunk and hell raiser. And apparently that's not that unusual in a, in the Russian tradition, especially in the Siberian tradition where Rasputin's from,

Speaker 3:          01:30:08       there are some offshoots and sex and cults who had these interesting beliefs and I don't understand them and wouldn't, wouldn't try to explain them, but apparently it involves needing to sin sometimes in order to get the right kind of repentance working for you. And, and there are rumors of orgies that take place as part of the rights for these religions. And some historians, not most, but some have tied Rasputin to some of those, um, strange sex and strange beliefs and it would make sense in one in one sense though, because there's, there are conversations that have been recorded with his wife and yes, he was married, you know, when she would walk past him in, in, in, in the middle of a town with other women and they would all see him having sex in the open with some towns, woman, she would say something to the effect of, well, that's just his cross to bear. He's got to do that. You know what I mean? Like he didn't want to just, he has to do that. That's, that's he's helping those people. I'm sure if I was rescued and I would want to sell it that way, let's put it that way.

Speaker 3:          01:31:04       The to gossip column type offenses that he's, he's always tarred with our, our extreme drunkenness and sexual outrageousness. And usually in combination with each other,

Speaker 3:          01:31:17       there are rape charges that are brought to the czar in Zarina's attention were the household staff is accusing him of going after them. He's absolutely brazen. He will sit down next to have a figure from the royal family and put his arm around her at a party with all the aristocrats there and start moving in on her. There are stories that you have to know that the Zaras arena knew he was this way because at these family gatherings I mentioned earlier where they're all sitting there and it's just him and the family. He'll sit next to the princesses who are all adolescent girls during this time period and they will jump up like they've been prompted with a hot needle because he's goosing them and feeling them in front of the czar and Zarina. And yet at the same time, um, some

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       of this stuff is passed off as just part of his rustic peasant charm. Isn't it cute that he doesn't know how inappropriate that is? Like I said, some of these people in Russia's aristocracy hated him, but those who didn't kind of had a reaction like he was some sort of exotic thing that the zoo brought in and you have to make allowances for what he doesn't understand. He might not know. You can't just walk up and touch them. Noble Woman's breast at dinner and how, how funny and interesting it is at isn't outrageous, you know, that kind of an attitude. Uh, but he was fun and historian Joseph Fermin, who's written two books on Rasputin, pointed that out, quote Rasputin was fun. It was a pleasure to be in his company. He gave people nicknames and they were often cutting and quite appropriate. He might double a woman hot stuff, boss lady, sexy girl, or good looking while a man would be called fancy pants, big breaches, long hair or fellow people accepted this as a charming characteristic. The humor of a peasant who meant no disrespect and quote.

Speaker 1:          01:33:02       So the people that didn't hate Rasputin would often, you know, overlook his outrageousness and consider that part of, you know, his charm is rustic peasant charm. Nonetheless, sometimes it was a little too much. Even for the czar, there's famous incidents and they all end up in the local media. Believe it or not, Russia had a tabloid media during this time period. And Rasputin was one of their staple, you know, figures. But I mean, back in my day, every one of them had to have it Elizabeth Taylor story or a Michael Jackson story or something like that. Kim Kardashians, probably today, back then in Russia, if you didn't have a respite in the story, you know, every so often, I mean you were worried about circulation dropping and just when you think there'd be no new news, he gets roaring drunk in a, in a Highfalutin restaurant in the capital city. Starts yelling about how he knows the czar and then pulls his pants down and whips his genitals out to the restaurant word like that, gets around in the tabloids, eat it up. At one point, does our had to tell the tabloids that they couldn't mention his name anymore. So they just started referring to him as the guy who lives on so and so street, whatever street he lived on. And everyone in the public just knew who they meant.

Speaker 1:          01:34:13       There were cartoons that made the rounds showing Rasputin, um, with his hand on the naked breast of the Zarina, implying what a lot of people wondered about this relationship. Although it's almost certainly not true if Rasputin's going around town, sleeping with everything that moves from peasants to royal women as well. What's he doing with the Zarina? There are even whisperings and one public charge made that the

Speaker 1:          01:34:43       heir to the throne. The Tsar's son is really Rasputin son. Almost certainly not true, but the more gossip circulated with that kind of talk, the more it undermined, you know, people's trust in the [inaudible] arena. Remember this arena's already German at a time when the Russian people are hounding Russian generals who just have German last names. What happens if you are German and the [inaudible] not around and this strange Russian peasant who seems like a spin golly is. I mean there were protests in 1915 where the people were saying down with respite and down with Alexandra, he's not an unknown quantity. Everyone realizes he's almost a public figure. They debate him in the legislature and the powers that be want him gone. There's a story during this time period about one of the ways they tried to get him out. It's a famous story one day Rasputin. Here's a knock at his door. He goes to the door and there's a man standing there with a package and he gives risks in the package and Rasputin opens the package and it's full of photos and Rasputin looks at the photos and they are photos of him unconscious, insensible due to drink, and there are naked women all around him. Night photos.

Speaker 1:          01:36:00       The man at the door who gave him the package says either you leave town and go back to where you came from and stop talking and influencing the czar or we're going to give these pictures to him. It was an extortion attempt and I'm one of the nights apparently that respite and had passed out from drink. His enemies had hired prostitutes and position them around him naked and started taking photos to blackmail him. In typical, unexpected fashion. Rasputin took the photos straight to the czar and sort of, you know, threw himself on the mercy of the court.

Speaker 1:          01:36:32       Now a lot of the time Rasputin's able to skate away with no real repercussions. Sometimes he's not, as we said, occasional riffs would develop between the czar and Rasputin. One of them, for example, that went on in 1912, is a perfect example of how hard it was for the czar to stay away from Rasputin in 1912. They have one of these disagreements on the [inaudible] sends Rasputin back to Siberia. The royal family goes on a vacation in September, 1912 to their country palace. They're playing around in the young heir to the throne. Lexi jumps in a boat. He's about seven or eight years old. Not Unusual, not unusual for seven or eight year old to land wrong and hurt themselves, but most of these seven or eight year olds, of course, not hemophiliac, so it instantly becomes a problem. There's a giant Hematoma in his lower abdomen.

Speaker 1:          01:37:17       They take them back to the palace and they have a terrible scare. He gets very ill, very bad. Uh, it takes about a month for him to start to recover. And as he's just starting to turn the corner, and I've never understood this, his mother, there's our arena, thinks it'd be great to take them on a little carriage ride and it's a bumpy road and they hit some bumps and he cries out and pain and something's happened inside him. They take him back to the palace and now they have one of the most horrific periods of their life starting because this kid starts to die and it takes a while and it's very painful and the parents are watching it. I mean the kids fever skyrockets.

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       The pain becomes so terrible. He's delirious and slipping in and out of consciousness. I read somewhere that a opium is used in the past sometimes for people in the heir to the throne, his condition, but they didn't use it for him. And the screams are so terrible that we're told the palace staff has to stuff cotton in their ears to walk around to deal with it. The parents, like I said, loving real hands on. Parents take their turn at his bedside and he's begging for help. He's, he's saying, Lord, have mercy on me. Was one of the things recorded over and over and over again and my mom helped me the pain and we're told that when the parents shifted, the bedside was over, they would walk out of the room and just burst into tears. The czar said that the Zarina handled the ordeal better than he did at a certain point that doctors run out of things to do.

Speaker 3:          01:38:45       They tell the parents there's nothing more they can do. It becomes apparent to the parents and to the patient that he's dying and he starts talking about those things that destroy parents. I mean that you never want to hear your little kid saying he's. He's saying, when I die, will the pain be gone to his mother? He asked that after he dies, they build this little shrine in the woods for amount of stones and then the reality of the situation sets in and they start putting together a public statement to tell the Russian people that the heir to the throne has died. The last rites are performed and while at a meeting, the czar gets a hand scrawled note from his wife saying, come quickly. I think it's time the boy's about to die at the last minute, the Zarina pens and note to rest butte and often Siberia essentially saying help and she gets a cable the next morning.

Speaker 3:          01:39:39       It's a famous cable and it lets a little air out of the tires that it's not as good. According to a historian, Josef Herman, as we always thought it was, the cable was always thought to say God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The little one will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much. And quote Russians during the Alexandra Spring, uh, apparently says there was, there were two notes, but the one that was misquoted really said, quote, fear nothing. The illness is not as dangerous as they're saying. See that the doctors do not bother him. And by that afternoon the boy is out of pain and is able to sleep and the fever starts dropping. The doctors are stunned and it should be pointed out. They hate Rasputin, but they were forced. I mean, there's several of them quoted in the infirmary [inaudible] latest book.

Speaker 3:          01:40:31       He's written two books on Rasputin and they're just, they don't know what to even make of it and it wasn't just this time they would be trying to stop the boy from bleeding and past incidents and Rasputin would come up and they would watch him stop it and historians have been trying to find explanations for this ever since. I mean, I've heard everything from hypnosis to the power of suggestion to drugs to one theory is that that they were giving the young czar aspirin, which was like the new wonder drug back then and that of course would have been the worst thing to give them and when respite and says don't let the doctors bothered him too much. They stopped giving him the Asprin. Some people have suggested that there were some potion Rasputin had the sort of kept the boy, you know, in a bad state. Anytime he wanted to, you know, put a little emotional pressure on the royal family. There's all kinds of theories, but if you're the Zarina and you've already seen respite and save your son's life several times and he just pulled him back from the brink of death by telegram, don't you think you'd stop caring about the wherefores and the what ifs and just not want this guy to leave your side.

Speaker 3:          01:41:39       If the czar of Russia was in the process of kicking his respite and habit, he fell off the wagon after that 1912, you know, pull your son back from the brink of death moment. Now, here's the thing, Rasputin wasn't a problem because he kept healing the heir to the throne. If he had stuck to that, probably we don't even talk about him very much. Of course, the reason we do talk about and the reason he's a famous figure, the reason half of Russia wants him dead is because he's not sticking to fixing the air. He's meddling in policy in a funny way to. I can see how that happened. I'm not so appalled. I mean, if you, if you, if you look at this from the czar as our arenas vantage point and you think this guy has something, does arena thinks he's a man of God and that God favors him and all the in the prophetic and if you'd seen what she'd seen, wouldn't you think? So maybe to win if you thought that, wouldn't you want to use this guy like a magic eight ball, especially with the stakes as high as they are for the czar at this time. I mean, when the first world war breaks out, when the Romanov Dynasty is threatened, when millions of lives hinge on the decision the Zar makes, how tempting would it be? You know, to just sort of ask Rasputin what he thought about disappointment or that idea. Should I go to the front end to command from the front line sources? Say Yes.

Speaker 3:          01:43:02       And that's the event. By the way, the czar going to command at the front lines, which opens up the door to turbo charging Rasputin's influence and really ushering Russia into the terminal phase of the end of the Romanov Dynasty. Because what happens is, you know the terrible losses against the central powers that the Russians had suffered. The czar thought that people might need a scapegoat and he altruistically offered himself up as a sacrificial lamb. He thinks he's going to go to the front. His advisors think this is a terrible idea, would lots of downsides, but Rasputin likes the idea. Therefore, by the way, those aren't. Rena likes the idea. At one point the Zaras wavering and things maybe he shouldn't do it in Rasputin bolsters his confidence that it's a good idea and so the czar leaves the capital and goes to Kinda close to the front lines and all of a sudden there's our arenas left in charge of day to day activities

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       and she's using rest Putin like a magic eight ball, like you wouldn't believe.

Speaker 1:          01:43:58       You can read it in the letters back and forth between the tsar and his wife because she'll inform them what's going on. She calls Rasputin our friend. That's your little code name for him. And she'll say to the, are our friend thinks we should do this. Our friend doesn't like that legislator. Our friend thinks that appointment job should go to this person and they'll debate it back and forth and Rasputin is making huge decisions for Russia's future in war time when things are deteriorating badly and bread riots are happening and and and dissatisfaction is palpably on. The rise and demonstrations are occurring and he's drinking 12 bottles of wine a day at wake up. I don't think the belligerent powers of the other countries aren't aware of it either. The British secret service is monitoring according to historians like Joseph Herman, Monitoring Rasputin. They have a nickname for him, a code name. They call them dark forces and many things about Rasputin troubled and they're not sure. He's not a German agent. They think he's unstable. Certainly they think he is in favor of some sort of peace deal to get rushed out of the war. There's a lot of reasons they don't Kinda like him, but this problem is becoming acute and

Speaker 1:          01:45:08       some nobleman apparently take it upon themselves to read Russia of this cancer, which is the way they see risks. Putin that decided to kill him, and when we reached this point, we're actually caught up with the story timeline again. It's December 19, 16 where we left off before our little Russian digression, you know, that time with the submarines and the peace deals on the table and the questions about the US getting into the war or not. In December, 19, 16, rumors are flying and the capital that Rasputin is going to be killed and they're so pervasive. Rasputin hears them, allegedly has children, hear them do, and they hide his clothes so he can't go out. Nonetheless, even with those rumors flying, he can't resist. And this is the traditional story. This is a Kennedy assassination type thing. And Good Luck finding the truth. I'm just giving you the, the most common story here.

Speaker 1:          01:46:08       Apparently a nobleman offers his wife to rest Butin, you know, a nice little clandestine arrangement, uh, after a party or something like that. Rasputin takes the guy up on the offer. He's a nobleman. Felix, you saw Paul is his name and I think he's so rich. He has more money than the ruling dynasty and he's working with a bunch of other men. It's a true conspiracy. Nobody knows how deeply there are some who think the British secret service was even in on it. The majority don't you stop off, meets Rasputin kind of at his door, brings him down into the basement. A Yankee doodle to tie this story together wonderfully is playing on the phonograph upstairs that they can hear. So you get this little American playing in this story

Speaker 3:          01:46:50       as, as a Russia reaches the terminal phase here in the Romanov Dynasty. Um, there's food on the table, there's wine. Uh, the rendezvous is a little pushed back. You saw Bob says. So they sit there and they eat the food and they drink the wine and after a while you stop off, begins to freak out because he's laced all these things with cyanide. And this guy's not dying.

Speaker 3:          01:47:16       He says he's a, his throat's bothering him a little in his stomach's bothering him a little, but he's, he's sitting there drinking more, eating more than asking you so pumped to sing for him. I liked your singing voice, you so bob, he excuses himself, goes upstairs to where the other conspirators are and freaks out. What are we going to do? Finally, one of them decides, um, they should shoot him. And [inaudible] got a pistol so you soap up, goes down there, tells 'em Rasputin to look at something on the wall over there. And then, uh, when Rasputin turns around, the pistols pointed at him, you saw Paul says, he said, you know, say your prayers or something like that, shot him in the chest. He screams and he falls down on the rug, frothing at the mouth, convulsions dies.

Speaker 3:          01:47:55       The assassins all come downstairs, have a look at the body, the blood, everything. Go upstairs to commiserate about it for awhile. And then we're told that the assassin yourself off, wants to have another look at the body. And so he goes downstairs and, uh, just affirming the historian quoting some original sources in his quote, talks about what happened when you soap off. Went down there to just make sure that nothing wasn't. Miss Thurman writes, quote, he found Rasputin lying in the same position on the floor. Overcome with a terrible inner rage, you soap up, grabbed Rasputin by the shoulders, and shook him as he stared into Rasputin's face. First one I and then the others suddenly opened and then the source he's quoting, says greenish and snake I'd they fixed the prince with an expression of satanic hatred. Rasputin stumbled to his feet, foaming at the mouth, roaring and anger, and wildly clawing at the air.

Speaker 3:          01:48:48       As he rushed towards you soph off blood dripping from his mouth, he grabbed the prince by the shoulder, ripping an epithet from his uniform. Rasputin was reportedly groundling, his tormentors name, and a low guttural voice and quote. It's like a Zombie. And you soap office screaming. I mean everybody runs downstairs when they hear this struggle going on and use up of a screaming. And by the time everybody gets downstairs, Rasputin has lurched into the snowbound courtyard in his running away and he's yelling, you so offs first name, who's also the prince. It's Prince yourself of Felix Felix. I'll tell this, I'll read everything you know he's going to tattle on the prince for trying to kill him. And people opened. Fire the prince among others at Rasputin, as he flees Mrs a couple times, then hits him somewhere in the back and then they run up to the body that's on the ground and they put a bullet through his forehead. Then we're told they wrap him up in a, tie them up, then wrap him up in a carpet than go to a nearby

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       river where there's ice and throw them through a hole on the ice and you know, hope floats to Finland. Of course he doesn't. They find him in a few days. They dragged the body out and and the myth of this story, and again, it's so much better with the myth, is that during the autopsy, they found water in his lungs and his body untied as though he had freed himself and only at the end drown. So the cyanide edema didn't work. They shot him multiple times. It didn't work. They threw him in the river and it almost didn't work. Historians say that the shot to his forehead almost certainly killed him. It's right in the middle of his forehead. And it's possible that the cyanide was old or that never got put in his drinks, or who knows, but it adds to the legend of Rasputin. There's a warning before he dies that he gives to the royal family. Supposedly. That also adds to his legend. You know, another one of these prophecies that are sometimes uncannily correctly supposed to have said to the royal couple quote, if I die or you desert me, you will lose your son and your crown in six months.

Speaker 1:          01:50:57       Rasputin is right again from beyond the grave.

Speaker 1:          01:51:06       This period in the first world war, his timeline about the time period Rasputin dies, you know, take a couple of months before he was assassinated, a couple of months afterwards. That really is the first world war is crowded our. And you know, that's what Theodore Roosevelt called his combat in the Spanish American war. He was trying to describe these large number of events that was crammed into a short period of time. He said it was his crowded, our, the period from about November 19, 16 to April 19, 17 is the first world war was crowded. Our huge number of events compressed in a short period of time. These events are all connected though to the various themes we've examined individually so far. The United States and the United States involvement in Mexico,

Speaker 1:          01:51:52       the submarines, the high level diplomatic activity and maneuvering, and the train wreck that's about to happen with Russia. This all comes to a head, as we said in January, late January 19, 17. Woodrow Wilson gives his peace without victory speech. While he's doing that, the Germans are already behind the scenes prepping for their February first resumption of unrestricted warfare. They've pulled the trigger on that because they had given the high level politicians in Germany the go ahead to try some peace maneuvering. Of course, they were told that the peace maneuvering doesn't when we let the submarines go, the submarines are slated to go February first, 1917 now because Germany was reasonably sure as was everyone else. Pretty much

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       that if they started shooting at every ship on the high seas, the United States was going to get dragged into the war because Americans would die. American ships would go down. It was pretty much inevitable. So the Germans started working on some contingency plans in January 19, 17, you know, again, right around the same time Wilson's proposing piece for all men and all his high minded sentiments. The Germans are sending a telegram to their ambassador in Mexico, giving their ambassador in Mexico some instructions on what to do just in case the United States comes into the war and starts fighting Germany. The telegram from the German foreign secretary, a guy named Arthur Zimmerman to the ambassador of Mexico, says this quote, we intend to begin on the first of February, unrestricted submarine warfare. We shall endeavor in spite of this to keep the United States of America neutral. In the event of this not succeeding, we make Mexico a proposal of alliance on the following basis, make war together, make peace together, generous financial support and an understanding on our part that Mexico is to reconquer the last territory in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. The settlement in detail is left to you. You will inform the president of the above most secretly as soon as the outbreak of war with the United States of America is certain. And add the suggestion that he should on his own initiative, invite Japan to immediate adherence and at the same time mediate between Japan and ourselves. Please call the president attention to the fact that the ruthless employment of our submarines now offers the prospect of compelling England in a few months to make peace and quote.

Speaker 3:          01:54:36       So there's a note suggesting that Mexico go to war as part of the central powers against the United States. If the United States gets into the war, what's more? They talk about getting Japan on board too. That was one of the United States is great worries. By the way. The Japanese had scared the Americans. There's all these theories from American planners that maybe they could go take the Panama Canal and come up through Mexico mean there's all these war plan kind of fantasies, but the idea that Japan could be brought in and flipped because they're on the allied side. The Germans are talking about flipping the Japanese, making them on the central powers to having the Japanese attack the Americans, the Mexicans attack the Americans. If nothing else, that keeps the Americans busy so they're not over there fighting Germans in Europe.

Speaker 3:          01:55:20       If you're playing a board game here of risk or something that's not a bad idea, you know, there's a game called diplomacy. Not a bad move if you're playing the game called diplomacy, proud ms dot all kinds of variables in real life, not taken into account in the game of diplomacy. One of them is that your enemies might be tapping into the cable that you use to send a secret message like from Germany to Mexico. The British got it, snatched it right off of the American Atlantic cable, which they were tapping. I think we mentioned in an earlier episode that British may be the, the best espionage code breaker people of all time. When the war starts, they cut the German transatlantic cables. Uh, Germany can't send telegraph messages across the Atlantic. So they work out deals to borrow other people's cable. Sometimes the United States let them use the US cable for just messages.

Speaker 3:          01:56:19       Woodrow Wilson thought would, would maybe foster peace, right? He wants to the Germans to have an open channel to him. So the Germans used the American cable to send a message to Mexico offering some American states to them if they come in the war by attacking the United States. A little ironic there. Now the British have a problem. They can't tell the Americans about this cable right away because then you're going to get all these embarrassing questions like how'd you get the cable? And then the British would have to say if they were going to be truthful. Well, we tapped into your cable and we've been reading your messages for the whole war. Can't quite say that too easily. So by hook or by Crook, it's a great story. Barbara Tuchman wrote a whole book on it. Um, the British figure out a way to sort of hide the source of, you know, how they got this cable.

Speaker 3:          01:57:09       They give it to the Americans. Woodrow Wilson is shocked. Just shocked that this would happen and understand the context, right? This is the very month, January 1917 that American military forces are finally withdrawing from the Poncho via expedition, right? This attempt to go get this terrorist us settlers in Arizona and New Mexico and Texas would have called you and and the US forest kind of comes back with their tail between their legs. They didn't get Poncho via, they killed a bunch of his men, but despite, you know, high public praising of everything involved General John Black Jack pershing says it wasn't a very memorable period in American history. Nonetheless, it made the Mexicans mad as hell. And, and the US almost went to war with Mexico twice in two years. In 1914 US troops occupied the city of Vera Cruz and about 200 people died in that little endeavor, maybe closer to 300. A nearly caused the war between the US and Mexico.

Speaker 3:          01:58:05       Then and then in this Poncho via expedition, the u s crosses the border, goes after a guy who is also the enemy of Mexico's leader, but it's so upset the Mexicans to have US troops in their country for any reason that that almost led to war. And so just as you're getting your troops the very month you're getting your troops out of Mexico, the Germans are sending them a telegram saying, Hey, want to go to war against the United States? I'll give you three states, will help you. It struck a nerve for Americans. When Woodrow Wilson released that letter publicly, when the public first heard

Speaker 1:          01:58:42       about Germany's offered in Mexico, their reaction was one that I think would, would mirror the reaction of the American public in a similar situation today. A large number of them thought that the telegram was a forgery, that British intelligence was behind it. That this was an attempt to trick the American government and to affect American public opinion and make them more angry at Germany. More pro war. And it's interesting to speculate how much you know, that sort of perception would have stayed that way. If the German foreign secretary, Arthur Zimmerman hadn't done something in early March, 19, 17 that looks inexplicably, he admitted that the telegram had been sent and that it was genuine twice. The second time he, he said he hoped the American people would understand that this was only to come into effect if war broke out between Germany and the United States as a way of saying, you know, you don't understand then, right? The American people wouldn't understand the confirmation that the Zimmerman telegram was indeed an official secret proposal from the German government to the Mexican government have set a ton of Americans and undercut the cause of German Americans and Irish Americans who were hoping to keep the United States neutral was another nail in the coffin of neutrality and a huge German misstep.

Speaker 1:          02:00:02       In fact, the whole decision to unleash the submarines when they did was a bad decision by Germany. If they had only waited a little while. Longer events would have happened that would have made that move unnecessary, and if that's the move that gets the United States into the war, than it would have made that event unnecessary. Winston Churchill points out that the timing of the events that happened in March and April 19, 17 in his mind show the hand of destiny at work. Here's how he frames what's about to happen and what's about to happen. Ladies and gentlemen, that will screw up everything here and you know, set the stage for our modern world as much as the United States getting into this conflict will set the stage for the modern world. Russia has its revolution.

Speaker 1:          02:00:54       Churchill says this quote, the beginning of 1917, was marked by three stupendous events, the German Declaration of unlimited you boat wore the intervention of the United States and the Russian revolution taken together. These events constitute the second great climax of the war. The order in which they were placed was decisive. If the Russian revolution had occurred in January instead of in March, or if alternatively the Germans had waited to declare unlimited you boat war until the summer, there would have been no unlimited you boat war and consequently no intervention of the United States. If the allies had been left to face the collapse of Russia without being sustained by the intervention of the United States. It seems certain that France could not have survived the year and the war would have ended in a piece by negotiation or in other words, a German victory had Russia lasted two months less, had Germany refrained for two months more. The whole course of events would have been revolutionized in this sequence.

Speaker 1:          02:01:54       We discerned the footprints of destiny. Either Russian endurance or German impatience was required to secure the entry of the United States and both were forthcoming and quote. As we've mentioned already, the situation in Russia had been seeding and simmering for quite some time. The straw that broke the camel's back was an almost complete breakdown of Russia's transportation system, which had been withering since the war started, and that had suffered terribly in the winter. That had just happened. Russia almost couldn't handle it's transportation needs in peace time. After several years of war, there were whole cities that were not receiving enough food. One of them was the capitol Petrograd. Petrograd used to be called St Petersburg, but when the war started, that sounded a little too German, so they changed it to Petrograd. This is a city that will change its name all the time during the communist years. It will be known as Leningrad now at St Petersburg again.

Speaker 1:          02:02:52       Nonetheless, it's the big metropolis and it doesn't have enough food. You take a bunch of people who were angry, already add the war ad no food. It's not surprising they were marching. They'd been doing it all throughout 1917. His Irish historian William Mulligan points out quote from the beginning of 1917, there was a wave of strikes concentrated in Petrograd. On the seventh of March, 30,000 workers were locked out of the feudal law of armaments, plants in the city. The following day, International Women's Day, women gathered in the viborg working class district protest against high bred prices. They marched past Finland station toward Nevsky prospect, by which time the strikers number to $100,000 down with the war down with the high cost of living down with hunger bread for the workers. They cried as they marched through the city. The protesters connected their experience of war with much broader political claims.

Speaker 1:          02:03:48       Although the crux of their complaints was the food supply crisis. This material experience of war had political implications including the overthrow, the czarist regime, and an end, the war. It was possible in theory that the food supply system could be reformed, but the strikers knew the czarist regime could no longer reform itself and quote British General Sir Henry Wilson Winter Russia during this time period and came back and reported to his peers, you know, concerning how the people in Russia felt toward the czar and Zarina and told them quote, it seems as certain as anything can be, that the emperor and empress are riding for a fall. Everyone, officers, merchants, ladies, talk openly of the absolute necessity of doing away with them. They've lost their people. There are no bulls and now their army and I see no hope for them. There will be terrible trouble one day here and to quote, there are open discussions amongst some at the higher levels of Russian society. That terror attack should be made against the czar. Someone stands up at the Duma and important person later in this story and says that the czar needs to be removed by terrorist means if necessary.

Speaker 1:          02:05:03       Now it would be foolish to say that the royal court did not have their supporters. They did, and they had people who didn't have a problem with, you know, when emperor, but they had a problem with Nicholas the second, so there were all stripes in this idea that the czar needed to go and no consensus at all about what would take its place or how to get from here to there,

Speaker 1:          02:05:27       Russia and knew how to have protests and to revolt about a dozen years before this time period. They had the famous 19, oh, five revolution, which had also come after, you know, Russian problems in a war and that revolution broke out. It got so serious. The czar supposedly wrote out his application letter. He didn't deliver it, but it was ready to go. In that particular revolution. The crowd marched on the Winter Palace with the czar was to align of troops who opened fire on them, killing hundreds of them. It's known as bloody Sunday. Bizarre had received intelligence reports a few months before this event. Saying that quote recently. The conviction has been expressed without exception that we are on the eve of great events in comparison with which 19, oh, five was, but a toy and the quote that was from a police report that the czar received months before these demonstrations in March break out.

Speaker 1:          02:06:25       Now here's the thing, you know as with many historical events, they can be seemingly inevitable for the longest time and still come as a surprise when they actually show up. The people who were out in the streets March 7th, March eighth, which was international women's Day, they didn't know that this is the revolution. In fact, the people on the scene point out that that's one of the tipping moments in this situation when people understand, wait a minute, this just isn't another demonstration like the kind we've been having. This is the chance to topple the government. That's the big turning point and the actual moment of the turning point is one of those really interesting, almost turning point in history moments. Revolutionaries like Leon Trotsky, who certainly see it that way. Spend a lot of time talking about that moment. The tipping point in the revolution. This is seven days by the way, folks, seven days for a 300 year old dynasty to fall,

Speaker 1:          02:07:18       and it starts off with some factory strikers on March seventh. By the way, this is our calendar. These events in Russia happening on on the old calendar in February, so it's often called the February revolution and it makes the dating confusing as heck for someone like me. Nonetheless, March seventh by our calendar, 1917, there is an industrial strike. March eighth is international women's Day. The women go out and strike and protest about the lack of brand and all this. This seems to be key and so many people talk about it. The fact that the women are doing this, a lot of these women are the wives of soldiers at the front, which gives them a huge amount of credibility, as you might imagine with other soldiers and they're out on international women's Day. On the eighth, on the ninth, the women come back out, bring more people and go to factories and shops and businesses and grabbed the workers out and have them join the strike and the crowd swells to at least twice.

Speaker 1:          02:08:11       What it was the day before, by the next day, the industry of Russia's capital is paralyzed and to show you how out of touch the Zarina is with all this, she writes in her diary on March 10th about the troubles in the capital and she's basically in charge and the capital quote, this is a hooligan movement. Young people run and shout that there is no bread simply to create excitement along with the workers who prevent others from working. If the weather was very cold, they would probably all stay at home, but all this will pass and become calm if only the Duma will behave itself. And quote the Duma is the Russian legislature, which I think I said earlier, has about one percent of the power in the system and his art has about 99 percent. And is our arena is complaining that the dumas misusing its one percent sort of Russian revolutionary.

Speaker 1:          02:09:05       Leon Trotsky compares her pretty convincingly to Marie Antoinette before the French Revolution. Let them eat cake statement there. And she and the czar and before he died, Rasputin liked this one. Russian minister, a guy named protocol pop off and so he begins to sort of act as the Zarina's minister in all this situation and according to someone the scene, it's anger at him. That prompts a lot of this activity. The events that are happening starting really on March eighth and then March 9th are large enough to be a big news story and the international media is there. There are magazine journalists there, a newspaper reporters from Britain, France, places like that, telling the folks back home what's going on in the Russian capital. One is a British newspaper man named John Pollock and he writes about the women protesting. He calls them bread riots. He writes, and this is about March eight, and my apologies for my Russian pronunciation quote. The rioting was so far confined to the vibe Berg side, the chief workman's quarter of Petrograd, but in the center of the tramway service had already become irregular. On the ninth, the rioters stopped the trams across the river terrorizing the drivers and throwing parts of the mechanism away so that the service groups still more intermittent visits were paid to all the factories and the hands were called out in sympathetic strike against the sudden food shortage on this day to a prefect of police who threatened the crowd was killed,

Speaker 3:          02:10:34       strong coast act squadrons, patrol Petrograd, and there was a collision on the Nevsky in which the cost actually used their whips, but they told the crowd that they would not shoot so long as they only asked for bread, alarmed at the attitude of the Cossacks. The authorities on the 10th brought troops of the line into the streets to support the police, posted machine guns on the Nevsky and stopped traffic across it. At many points and quote John Pawlik then points out it sounds like a rumor, but what? What the Russian minister working for this arena is supposed to have said when his methods for dealing with this uprising or being questioned. Here's what Paul writes. He says, quote Frodo popoff approached by one who endeavored to convince him of the madness of his methods only answered, do you know how splendidly machine guns work from the roof? End Quote, pollock says that the first serious bloodshed happens on March 10th when police opened fire on a group of protestors and killer wound 50. The czar is now told about problems at the capital. Remember, he's off kind of at the front, not in this capital of his. He's letting his wife sort of run the show with this product pop off guy. Uh, the czar finds out about it. They tell them things are bad. He issues an order that basically says, make it stop.

Speaker 3:          02:11:56       That order appears on lamp posts and all over the city. The next morning when the rioters and protesters, um, muster to protests for the day, they see this message from the head of Petro grads. Military garrison quote, during the last days, disorders have taken place in Petrograd, followed by force and assaults on the lives of soldiers and members of the police. I forbid, every kind of assembly in the streets. I warned the population of Petrograd that commands have been issued and repeated to the troops to use their arms and not to stop short of anything in order to assure a tranquility in the capital end. Quote, John Pollock is out in the streets that day when he writes, quote

Speaker 3:          02:12:43       Sunday, March Eleventh, began nervously. There were soldiers everywhere in the streets and strong bodies held in reserve and courtyards. By now, the trams had all stopped and it was hardly possible to find a car. No newspapers appeared. About 3:30 PM, the troops begin to clear the streets around the Nevsky at the bayonet point, and soon afterwards the police turned their machine guns onto a crowd at the same place as the day before, but with more deadly effect. A Caucasian officer who was nearby estimating the number of dead at 300 at the same time, heavy firing took place further down the Nevsky and opposite the Khazan Cathedral. Several score. More people were killed. The crowd here retaliated with pistol shots, another prefix and a colonel of the police besides policemen, the various innocent passengers by being killed. It was significant.

Speaker 1:          02:13:32       He writes that soldiers were seen among the crowd, firing on the police, and a number of men in some 14 officers are different. Detachments were arrested for refusing to support the police with arms on the same afternoon, a drunken officer of the [inaudible] regiment named nameless, gavage ordered his men to fire on the crowd. They refuse, but less gavish forced one of the soldiers to obey his shot, killed a woman. And to quote

Speaker 1:          02:13:57       the hurting of women, as I said, seems to be an important part of this affair because it's mentioned by everyone. Trotsky says, the rumor that was going around was that a police officer struck a woman with a club and that this was witnessed by the cassettes who were sort of sitting by neutrally, uh, they're there to kind of add some muscle to the mix, but the army's kind of standing by while the hated police and the public face off. And Trotsky says whether or not it really happened. Everybody believed that a woman had been assaulted in front of the costs x and the Cossacks drove the police away. Who did it. Now, one of the things that if you've watched recent revolutions, you'll notice that oftentimes some incident will happen, that the demonstrators and protesters and rioters will sort of cling to some sort of symbol generally from the event that becomes almost like a high sign that protesters use and that they rally around according to Trotsky. What it was in this revolution was a cavalryman winking to the crowd

Speaker 1:          02:15:04       and that this wink became sort of a symbol of what was going on. Here's the way Trotsky explained it, and remember Trotsky's or revolutionary for him, this is a hugely heroic tale and that's the way he tells it and I think we're all colored. At least those of us who know what's coming by what's coming. This revolution's going to devolve into something very terrible and a lot of us look back on this event thinking that that's how we should view the removal of what came before communism. And yet there was a period after this revolution where Russia was on the road to becoming something more like the United States. And so getting rid of a czarist regime that these people seem to hate, like Saddam Hussein was initially viewed as a plus and the reporter on the scene, for example, for the British press, he's thoroughly in favor of something replacing this regime. The United States is too, by the way. One of the problems the United States has with joining the allies are being associated with the allies is not Britain and France who they feel very close to in a lot of ways it's Russia to them. Russia is the same kind of militant autocracy that US propaganda paints the Germans as

Speaker 1:          02:16:19       the idea of the czar going away to be replaced by some sort of constitutional government. Makes a lot of people in the allied camp sit up and cheer for the protesters.

Speaker 1:          02:16:30       Now in the story by Trotsky of the winking Casech, he explains that the officers or the cost x kind of forced them to charge into the crowd at one point. But as soon as the officers passed by and scattered the crowd, the regular costs x are very careful moving through with their horses not to hurt anyone. And Trotsky writes, quote behind them, filling the whole width of the prospect, Gallup, the cossacks decisive moment, but the horseman cautiously in a long ribbon rode through the court or just made by the officers. Some of them smiled, he quotes a protester, Kaya Rev recalls, and one of them gave the workers a good wink. This wink, Trotsky says, was not without meaning. The workers were in bold and with a friendly, not hostile kind of assurance and slightly infected the contacts with it. The one who winked found imitators in spite of renewed efforts from the officers.

Speaker 1:          02:17:22       The Cossacks without openly breaking discipline, fail to force the crowd to disperse, but flowed through it in streams. This was repeated three or four times and brought the two sides even closer together. Individual costs. X began to reply to the workers questions and even to enter into momentary conversations with them of discipline. There remained but a thin, transparent shell that threatened to break through any second. The officers hastened to separate their patrol from the workers and abandoned the idea of dispersing them lying to the coast, x out across the street as a barrier to prevent the demonstrators from getting to the center and to quote. He then tells the story though about how these costs x will allow themselves to be used as a mounted barrier, but they don't stop the protestors from diving under the horses' bellies. The fact that the Cossacks traditionally these czarist crowd control mechanism appear less than enthusiastic about carrying out their traditional role, convinces the government that they have to bring in the troops. The garrison of Petrograd is like 150, a hundred 60,000 men, so they've got the people and they call them in and March 11th is the key day because that's the day that elements of one famous unit, a training squadron that's called open fire and killed those people that the British reporter was talking about.

Speaker 1:          02:18:41       Now the people of Petrograd are appealing to the troops as you heard earlier, mingling with them, talking to them. They are walking up to the line of bayoneted troops, you know, in, in ones and twos and sang brothers. You're not really going to side with the police and kill us. Are you the women? Again, taking the lead in this whole thing are walking right up to the line of abandoned, had troops and grabbing their rifles with the band that's on them and wrestling with them insane. Join us. It's very heroic. There's a lot of that going on. After the shootings in the street on March 11th, uh, citizens were told workers go up to members of one of these story units

Speaker 1:          02:19:25       and tell them that, you know, people in your unit opened fire yesterday against the people of the city and told them what happened. And then those troops went back to their barracks. And on the evening of March, 11th morning of March twelfth, they had one of those moral crisis moments, a key instant in any revolution. A guy like Leon Trotsky would say. And he describes it with almost heroic, you know, tones. This, this moment where this story unit confronts the reality that they shot a bunch of those poor people that had been besieging them not to shoot the day before and they were going to have to go out and do it again today. Here's what Trotsky writes, quote, the soldiers had no more time for hesitation. They were compelled to shoot yesterday and they would be again today. The workers will not surrender or retreat under fire.

Speaker 1:          02:20:17       They're still holding their own and with them, their wives, mothers, sisters, sweethearts. Yes, and this is the very hour that they had so whispered about. If only we could all get together. Let me stop here at the Trotsky saying that all these people in the city had had thought about could desire be overthrown. If only we could all get together that would happen and now these soldiers were not taking part in that they were taking part in crushing that. If only we could all get together Trotsky rights and then at that moment of supreme agony in the unbearable fear of the coming day, the choking hatred of those who are imposing upon them the executioners role, their ring out in the barrack room, the first voices of open indignation and in those voices to be forever, nameless, the whole army with relief and rapture recognizes itself, thus dawned upon the earth, the day of destruction of the Romanov monarchy and quote, those soldiers shot there.

Speaker 1:          02:21:14       Officer ran out into the streets cheering and joined the people of Petrograd trying to overthrow the czar. They encouraged other military units to follow. Most of which by the end of March twelfth had done so. The the garrison was melting away and joining the anti czarist rioters. They ransack the artillery depot. Then they go to the arsenal and break into it and take all the weapons than they burned down the court of Justice and a bunch of other government buildings. And for March twelfth on, you have open battles in the streets between the people in the army and the very large police forces. You know, we would call them today the secret police and all these police agencies that have set up machine guns at intersections. At this point. The big question is, what the heck is the czar doing? The first thing is our tries to do is just get rid of the Duma and when the head of this powerless, for all intents and purposes, Russian legislature receives the order that the Duma is to disband. He says no, and most of the Duma joins him in the street joining the revolution.

Speaker 1:          02:22:27       Next, the czar gets on a train on the 13th of March and heads back toward the capital from the fighting front where he is in one of his typically strange moves. He takes a lot longer to get there than he should have because he says he doesn't want to disrupt any of the war traffic heading to the front. So his. His train takes sort of the long way around and it ends up getting stopped on the way to Petrograd because the revolution is spreading to other cities now and at one of these train stops, the revolutionaries are stopping the train. We're told that the czars advisors are bringing him telegrams from power brokers, including, for example, um, his cousin and others that he, he needs to give up the crown.

Speaker 1:          02:23:09       And what's sort of interesting about Nicholas is that he almost seems willing to do it. There's a whole line of thinking, you know, if you read a lot of the primary sources, he sometimes portrayed as this drunken tyrant, you know, and, but when you read more modern day history, he's a much more pitiable figure. Churchill likes him and moved, but Churchill would like Azhar but says great things about in this poor, misunderstood person. Of course he wasn't a great man, just a good man. And he talks about it in like that. But the czar sort of seems to be relieved by the prospect of giving up the crown. At first there's like five minutes of talk about giving it to his hemophiliac son, but this art doesn't want that. And interestingly enough in the abdication note to his people, the czar specifically mentions not wanting to be parted from, you know, the son that he adores. Once again, you get that feeling of nicholas and Alexandra has these kinds of parents who just adore their children. Whether or not this is some sort of smokescreen to cover something, all the evidence seems to point out to a guy who cared more about his family in some ways than beings are.

Speaker 1:          02:24:14       There was a quote to the guy who will take over the what's called the provisional government of, um, the country in the near future. His name is Alexander Kerensky, and he met the tsar after desire had been taken into custody. And he said, quote, as I studied his face, I seem to see behind his smile and charming eyes, a stiff, proper mask of utter loneliness and desolation. When I began to know this living mask, I understood why it had been so easy to overthrow his power. He did not wish to fight for it, and it simply fell from his hands and quote the things that this is our was going to have to do to keep power. He seemed unwilling to do. His wife may have wanted him to. She wrote letters telling him he needed to be tougher and stronger. He seemed to care more about the fact that all his children, while all this is going on, have a bad case of the measles, which was pretty serious back then and um, is as concerned seemingly for them as he is of giving up, you know, his power all over Russia, they to break into government

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       buildings and tear down paintings of the czar

Speaker 3:          02:25:30       and the aftermath of this revolution. Sounds like the aftermath of the fall of Saddam Hussein. Again, when all these figures that were part of the government that worked for the czar are being arrested and held in custody by people, you know, armed with weapons to power blocks form in the wake of all this. Because remember, there is no plan. The real revolutionaries who had been working for this for years. We're kind of caught off guard when it happened. So there's, there's competing groups for power. One group is the people that used to be the almost powerless Duma. All of a sudden they have power and they're mostly liberals and um, and mild socialist. And people who want to create, they end up writing the United States by the way in June saying this, they want to create a constitutional government. They want to use maybe the United States as a sort of a model, but competing with that particular entity for power is power at a much lower level groups that especially of revolutionaries forming councils of workers and soldiers together and they formed this rough, weird partnership with the provisional government is it's called the former Duma and they kind of work with each other sometimes, but they come to, you know, disagreements over other things.

Speaker 3:          02:26:43       But when push comes to shove, the Soviets as they're called these, you know, elected groups of people from soldiers and workers councils seems to win. The first thing that they win is a rule that says that anything involving the military is under the control of the Soviets. And this is the key issue for the other countries in the war in Germany wants Russia out of the war. They have been paying agitators for a long time to hopefully make that happen. Now you have this situation where the czars gone. What are the Russians going to do militarily, the British and the French field, the same way along with the Americans. They're not that upset that the czar is gone, but they're very concerned that Russia is going to pull out of the war. This provisional government, there'll be known as the Koretsky government. At a certain point, they tell the allies that they're going to continue fighting. They're committed to continue fighting the allies start pouring money and stuff into Russia even at a greater pace than they were before, but how do you continue to hold off Germany in the central powers with your army while you're 300 year old monarchy is busy collapsing and all the structures that have been hanging by a string start falling apart.

Speaker 3:          02:28:06       What are the soldiers at the front going to do? This became the key question and it's not answered right away. Churchill, as only he can solve the whole thing is an unmitigated disaster. Looking back on it from the late 19 twenties again, now he can where all this is

Speaker 1:          02:28:21       going to go to communism in the future, so his ideas are probably tainted. He said, the tragedy of Russia was, and I'm quoting here, that her ship went down within sight of port, meaning you know, we were just going to win this war, and then Russia doesn't get to share in the spoils, and he says, I've Russia quote, with victory in her grasp, she fell upon the earth, devoured alive like Herod of old by worms but not in vain. Her valiant deeds, the giant mortally stricken, had just time with her dying strength to pass the torch eastward across the ocean to a new titan long sunken doubt, who now arose and began ponderously to arm. The Russian Empire fell on March 16th on April sixth, the United States entered the war and quote, it's been an interesting two months for the United States since Germany decided to unleash the submarines in the first 20 days of unleashing the submarines.

Speaker 1:          02:29:19       The Germans sink a hundred and 28 merchant ships, 40 neutrals among them. Um, there are US shipping companies in the month of February when this all starts that start losing a million dollars. Nineteen 17 value money by the way, a week. The next month, March 19, 17, those numbers will double and all of a sudden we begin to see what the first real competent use involving at least a minimum number of submarines is like in world history. The Germans had been perfecting what you do with these new weapons systems like submarines, these science fiction type weapons. What do you. How do you use them at the beginning of the war? They're kind of going after war ships and whatnot, and then they work on short little burst going after neutrals and merchant ships and now by 1917 the Germans know what they want to do with these things and they have enough ships to make their plan work.

Speaker 1:          02:30:14       Minimum number, but enough they unleashed them to go after everything, which is what their strategy has told them. You have to do to really maximize this weapon system and they're sinking enough ships so that Britain is for the first time in the war in real danger itself of going under. One of the advantages of being an island nation is if you got the strongest navy, you don't have to have the same kind of fears that are Russia has or a France has. The Germans aren't going to be able to break you directly because they can't reach you. This is the first time in the war that the British face, any serious threat of the Germans in one way or another, reaching them, affecting them personally, forcing them perhaps to knuckle under to some sort of peace deal. In April the month the United States gets into the war, the Germans sync for 123 merchant men, almost 850,000 tons of shipping.

Speaker 1:          02:31:13       The British empire cannot stand those kinds of losses. It's submarine war that eventually brings the United States in. If for no other reason than it's disrupting operations in the country. The president is under a lot of pressure on a day to day increasing basis because once Germany started sinking, all these ships, US ships stopped leaving. They begin to congregate and clogged up and cause traffic jams outside the major ports on the eastern seaboard. And then all of the commodities and food and perishables that were going to be loaded onto those ships begin backing up. You got this terrible catalog at all the ports on the eastern coast of material that's rotting and degrading because the ship's won't cross the Atlantic because they're afraid of the submarines. At one point, Wilson wants to arm these ships to change the situation. He wants to provide insurance so that they can, you know, cross. But this is like a ticking time bomb for Wilson. He's got to do something. This situation only going to get worse. The Zimmerman telegram happens in late February to. I mean all these things that just increases situation that's bad and make it worse. But there's no instant moment where the line has been crossed and there never will be

Speaker 1:          02:32:33       at some point by March 19, 17 at the latest. And probably around the same time the Russian revolution is happening, the Wilson Administration decides that they've had enough five US ships go down in March 19, 17 to some in the Wilson Administration. This is confirmation that the US has already at war with Germany. There doesn't have to be some big Lusitania nine slash 11 moment to crossover this invisible line. It's happening every day and on April Second Wilson gives his most famous speech, one of the most important speeches in American history concerning the situation that he sees that the United States is at war with Germany. And the interesting part about the speech, if you dissected, it's monumental on so many levels. He's so crafty the way it's put together. He never says to the Congress, declare war on Germany, you know, so that will be at war with Germany. He says, we're at war with Germany and I invite you to confirm that fact he had no time.

Speaker 1:          02:33:31       Gives Congress the impression that they have any control over this decision at all. Now, luckily for him, they went along with him big time, but what if they hadn't? Part of Wilson's speech focuses on the specific reason. We're at this point. He talks about the submarine warfare, compares Germans to pirates and all these kinds of things. Then he takes some time out of his speech to say that we're not at war with the German people. We have no quarrel with them, it's their government we don't like and this is a big change by the way, in the way that much of the United States government will craft, you know, the way that they frame relationships with other countries too. I got nothing against the people. It's the government and Wilson's point of view is if the people aren't running the government like in a democracy or a republic, well then the people aren't responsible for what their government's decisions are. They may be the victims of it and we might have to hurt you in order to overthrow your government, but we're not mad at you about half this speech is really high minded sentiments forever known afterwards as Wilsonian principles that talk about things like the need to make the world safe for democracy. And I'll give you a taste of that in a second but more interesting. And again, one of the more groundbreaking parts of this speech is that Wilson takes on the US tradition of non involvement in European affairs head on.

Speaker 1:          02:34:53       And he basically said that was the way it was. Times have changed. Here's the exact phrasing that he gives, but it is a sea change in American foreign policy and the way the government of the United States approaches the conflicts and involvement with the rest of the world and that course change is one we are still living with today in the modern world in the middle of his speech telling Congress that award exists right now in Germany. Wilson says, quote,

Speaker 1:          02:35:23       our object now as then is to vindicate the principles of Peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples of the world, such a concert of purpose into action as well, hence forth. Ensure the observance of those principles. Neutrality is no longer feasible or desirable, where the peace of the world is involved and the freedom of its peoples and the menace to that peace and freedom lies in the existence of autocratic governments backed by organized force which has controlled holy by there will not by the will of their people. We have seen the last of neutrality in such circumstances were at the beginning of an age where it will be insisted that the same standards of conduct and have responsibility for wrong done shall be observed among nations and their governments that are observed among the individual citizens of civilized states and quote, having a national policy connected to the idea of not going abroad in search of monsters to slay just started to sound really old fashioned, didn't it?

Speaker 1:          02:36:30       But at least Wilson's got some really good arguments to justify the historic course change. These are the ideas of wilsonianism and here's how Wilson annunciates just some of them quote, it is a distressing and oppressive duty. Gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great, peaceful people into war into the most terrible disasters of all wars. Civilization itself seeming to be in the balance, but the right is more precious than piece and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts for democracy, for the right, those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments for the rights and liberties of small nations for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free to such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are in, everything that we have with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might, for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured God helping her.

Speaker 1:          02:37:50       She can do no other and quote one wonders what John Quincy Adams would reply to that nonetheless. Guys like Theodore Roosevelt, who had been saying he was going to skin Wilson alive if Wilson didn't go to war like the speech a lot.

Speaker 1:          02:38:10       It's interesting to note by the way, that the one American political figure that the Europeans really respect in this whole question is Theodore Roosevelt, because Theodore Roosevelt is really one of the early what will be called Atlanta cysts. People who believe, for example, in locking arms with countries like Great Britain and doing great things with them. Tiara was an interventionist before his time and in the United States. He's thought of as an extremist. The Republican candidate for president tells him to stop campaigning for him because he's so bellicose. It's working against the Republican Party, right? You're letting Wilson and the opposition portray us as warmongers. That's the guy though that appeared to be ahead of the curve when it came to figuring out that Germany needed to be dealt with. Again, from the British point of view, there's a lot of this that you could look at and say the various things the Germans are being slammed for doing are things that they were kind of forced into doing by what their opponents were up to.

Speaker 1:          02:39:09       The first world war is not the clear cut, good and evil separation that the Second World War is, and we've mentioned that before. Nonetheless, if you're on one side of it, it certainly is the prime minister of Great Britain for about a couple of months when Wilson makes his historic speech, is Lloyd George in his memoirs, Lloyd George Writing after the war can't help but take a shot at Wilson, not because of what he did, but because of how long it took him speaking about Wilson's speech. Now, George writes, quote, these principles were excellent and excellently expressed. The ally. Democracies are France and the British Commonwealth had already borne the burden and been scorched by the heat of a thousand days in the battle with this natural flow to liberty, stealing one of Wilson's lines from his speech they rejoiced. George does at the advent of this powerful help from the greatest democracy in the world at a time when troubles were multiplying, they perhaps might be excused for thinking.

Speaker 1:          02:40:13       That issue is so clear now to President Wilson ought to have been apparent earlier to his eyes. They felt grateful in their hearts to the great American Theodore Roosevelt, whose vision was so undimmed and who sympathies were so sure from the outset of this grim struggle for international right and quote Winston Churchill sounded almost the exact same way. What took you so long? Speaking of Wilson's piece, attitudes quote he had behind his policy or reason to explanation and massive argument and all must respect the motives of a statesman who seeks to spare his country the waste and horrors of war, but nothing. Churchill writes, can reconcile what he said after March 19, 17 with a guidance he had given before. What he did in April, 19, 17. Could have been done in May 19, 15. And if done then what abridgment of the slaughter, what sparing of the agony, what ruined, what catastrophes would've been prevented in how many million homes with an empty chair be occupied today? How different would be the shattered world in which victor and vanquished alike are condemned to live and quote, writing from the late 19 twenties and seeing the mortally wounded and terribly scarred continent, which Winston Churchill remembers as being the height of world civilization to him. The US taking this long to get into the war looks like something that costs you the world you knew

Speaker 1:          02:41:45       a couple of days after the president gives his famous speech, the Congress votes to support him and take the nation to war. The vote wasn't close by the way, in the House of Representatives, it was something like 374 or 375 to 50 and as much as a wipe out as that sounds, I read somewhere that that's the second most opposition. The congress has ever shown the president in a war vote. The war of 18, 12 being the most nonetheless seems pretty clear that most of those people voting or unsure about what voting for going to war was going to mean the future mayor of New York fiero Laguardia was a congressmen when this vote was taken. He said that 60 percent, he said 30 years after the war, that 60 percent of his brethren, we're pretty sure this wasn't going to mean troops on the ground in Europe. The US didn't send armies overseas to fight, you know, on European soil. They thought it was going to be like financial aid and naval help. Naval helped is the one thing that us can do right away. Military Health and an army. That's a problem because the US really doesn't have one.

Speaker 1:          02:42:52       In April, 19, 17, the US army's ranked 17th largest in the world. Doesn't have any flame throwers or any tanks or any gas masks or mortars, no grenades. The aircraft are these rickety strange beasts that you the right bread, they look like the planes, the Wright brothers kind of put together. They don't look modern at all. There's not enough artillery shells for the guns to shoot more than a few minutes by western front, you know, standards.

Speaker 1:          02:43:27       Historian, justice donut key says that the US relatively speaking had been better prepared for the American revolution and the war of 1812 than they were prepared for the first world war. I disagree with him about that, but his point is well taken. The United States, if it's going to be any help to Europe, Europe's going to have to survive while it waits for this help to be accumulated. The only place that us can help right away is with money, which they were kind of doing already. They're going to lower interest rates and give better deals, but it's a continuation of what was already happening and the use of the navy and the thing the navy can do right away is held against the submarines because as we said in April 19, 17, the submarine sink more than 400 merchant ships. Britain's problem isn't that it doesn't have to stop all the sinking.

Speaker 1:          02:44:16       It has to stop the rate, which is so much more than what it can rebuild. If it loses less ships than it can build a month, it's doing well. If it loses more shifts than it can build a month, it's in trouble. The height of this submarine war will be from February 19, 17 when unrestricted warfare is declared and the next eight months. This is when Britain lives or dies. Those are the stakes and Lloyd George and Churchill and all these guys go out of their way to talk about the almost alarm is the word Lloyd George's is Lloyd. George says that there are some of the most cautious people in his cabinet that are starting to muse out loud about maybe we better make peace while we still have some ships afloat,

Speaker 1:          02:44:54       and he says the Germans were getting gleeful that at times they just had these reports coming in that made all the pro sub marine people seem to be perfectly correct. They were all of a sudden going to win the war. Churchill said, we went from being, you know, the side that had time on our side and we could just wait this out and everyday the Germans were losing the war a little bit more to having the tables flipped and now time was on the German side and the British had to come up with countermeasures or lose the war fast. They not only did this, but it was the civilian leadership that pushed for the answer that turned out to make the biggest difference. This is sort of one of these early indications that something is changing in the war. For years, the military men have had an almost unquestioned authority to choose whatever path for fighting the war they wanted to, no matter what happened, but now so many people had died and so many disasters and so much of the same tactic seeming to equal the same results except more bodies stacking higher and higher that that there was pushback now from civilian leaders.

Speaker 1:          02:45:52       Lloyd George and Britain is one of these guys who's who says openly that my job is to protect the soldier in the field and to the soldier in the field, the generals, his biggest enemy sometimes, and you could hear all this, talk about the stupidity of the military leaders. Even Churchill kind of goes out of his way to say that the military experts all against the solution that ended up solving the sub problem. It was the civilian leaders for the most part, that pushed the idea that won the day. The idea was both breathtakingly simple and incredibly complex. The idea was convoys, the grouping of ships into large formations surrounding them with war ships and escorts and sending these large bodies of ships across at organized times and schedules. The military men often believed that this was just going to group your targets for the submarines, make it even easier to align ships up like in a shooting gallery, but when it was experimented on again, the civilian leaders pushing to experiment with this. The results were fantastic almost right away. The u boats, that approach, these kinds of formations often got sunk. The idea that it was going to be easier to spot 50 or 60 ships on the water rather than a single ship turned out to not be true in the vast spaces of the ocean. Big Ole convoys got swallowed up to and as Churchill said, when these convoys made it across the water and slipped through the blockade, instead of having one ship make it through the German blockade, you had 40, 50 or 60 ships do it

Speaker 1:          02:47:23       by October 19, 17 of 99 convoys heading to Great Britain with more than 1500 ships in them. Only 10 that were still part of the convoy, we're sunk 14 more that it straight and got lost. We're sunk. Those are easily replaceable losses. And by October 1917, it was clear that the Germans were no longer going to be able to sink more shipping than the British could replace what's more. They now had us ship yards helping to replace them. As you might imagine, the whole decision on Germany's part to engage in this kind of submarine warfare is one of the most, if not the most criticized decision that the German leadership ever made. It's understandable and you know, it kind of once again puts the lie to this stereotype of the Germans as sort of applauding methodical, sort of, um, you know, conservative sort of leadership style because in both were awards, the Germans would prove to be great, great gamblers. They just weren't lucky gamblers, but they were willing many times to sort of throw caution to the wind and try these things. In a sense though, it's a defense mechanism when you are the weaker party

Speaker 1:          02:48:40       mean to me, the analogy that works best in the in the war that, that we have going right now is to weight lifters competing against each other and one of these weightlifters is bigger and stronger than the other one, which is obviously a huge advantage in weightlifting, but it isn't. Everything on the weaker weightlifter has to try, you know, to make up for it with technique and training and will to win

Speaker 1:          02:49:05       and maybe taking some chances. That's Germany strategy for the rest of this war. And you know, you're seeing so many aspects of change from the 19th century to the 20th century that you can point to in the story. Because that's really the theme when you look at this war. You know, in a big picture sense. Germany has transformed in the recent past 1916 the year before this time. We're in now from really an old style monarchy with legislative, you know, balancing out to, to something that looks much more like a 20th century military dictatorship. And it doesn't happen overnight and it almost kind of happens because it needs to. The only way Germany has a chance in this war is to be the technique master and have the greater will to win. All those things I said about the smaller weightlifter. Germany has to organize it society more efficiently than the more powerful allied countries.

Speaker 1:          02:49:54       If it's going to stand a chance. And one of the things that happens is when you get Hindenburg and Ludendorff in there, remember the two German commanders, we talked about this military team, but it's really only one guy, the Luton Dorf guy. He takes on more and more the powers that in the 20th century we see over and over again in regimes where you have one strong man who sort of has dictatorial control and the Germans start to try to organize their society to make it more efficient. Like, you know, being able to tell workers where they're going to work, you know, controlling people down to that level. Because as one of the German leaders said, the goal is to turn Germany into one vast munitions factory. To do that requires a sort of single mindedness and and a lot of power concentrated in one person at this stage in the war.

Speaker 1:          02:50:37       That person is Ludina doors. He and Hindenburg took over in 1916 and the first thing they did was sort of do an audit of how the war is going and what we're doing to fight it in the conditions. And the first condition you noticed when you take over the entire war is on the western front. You have about two and a half million men manning the barricades. The other side has about 4 million men and their numbers are increasing every month. How do those trends look? You have food riots at home. Women fighting with police officers in the streets because they can't get the food they need. You have strikes in a bunch of the major firms and in a bunch of the cities and they get so bad sometimes the army has to be called in to disperse the strikers, so the government is now going in and sending strike leaders to the front to get them out of the way.

Speaker 1:          02:51:25       I mean, the society is under severe stress and we already talked about the food. I mean, there's a quote from earns glazer that that sums it up when he talks about this period they're in now and he, he says, quote soon, alluded ham, thrilled us more than the fall of Bucharest or some of parents success elsewhere, and to quote these people's needs have shrunk down to the most basic human survival levels. Yeah, great. We took Bucharest, but did you see that hand we have in the cellar that we found? I mean, you know, that's something any of us could understand if we began to starve. The pressure is on Germany's military leadership to do something. You can't very well launching offensive on the western front when you're outnumbered the way you are, you're going to be lucky to survive at all. Nineteen 16 was terrible for the Germans on the western front, so you launch the submarines and that becomes your chance to win the war without having to do the impossible. On the western front.

Speaker 1:          02:52:17       Now alluded, Dorf is a very strange guy. This is commander of Germany, you know, sort of in more every day in this story. Hindenburg, his partner is the charisma guy, but he's an old man. He really, if he had been great at one time in his life, he's in his dotage now and he's, he's the revered public face of this government, but lewd indoors doors, the guy behind the scenes and we talked about him and he's the one who way back in 1914, got that city in Belgium to surrender by banging on the front doors with the hilt of his sword, you know, when he easily could have been killed, walked right up to the front door loan guide. I mean, that's, he's an interesting guy. He's flawed in a lot of ways. And depending on which historian you grabbed, your going to hear the, the bumbling, uh, psychologically fragile Luton door for, you're going to see this is great gambler, who was, who was fantastic at certain things.

Speaker 1:          02:53:07       And remember, all these generals are 19th century men. They are adapting under fire at a quick pace to all these new conditions. And just when you think they are getting it, some new development comes around, maybe you're starting to understand the physics of land warfare a year or two into the first world war. If you're a general and then tanks appear and then gas appears. I mean, what do you do with all this airplane? Start having a real impact. You don't just have to learn. You have to be flexible to continue to evolve as these generals and nobody's great at it. Luton doors, not bad. Ludendorff changes. By the way, the basic strategy of the guy who came before him, Fun Falcon Heights strategy was, you know, basically defend every inch of territory. Luton. Dorf is perfectly willing to give up territory in exchange for killing people.

Speaker 1:          02:53:54       He'll pull off things like operation Alberico right about this time period starts in late February, 1917 where he will pull back troops that are, that are in unexposed loop in the line. The line isn't straight because of fighting here and there. It's bulging out in some places and there are kinks in it. And he begins in early 1917 to pull troops back that are, that are way out there in no man's land and straightened up his line. He'll cut off like 25 miles from the western front by doing this, freeing up 13 or 14 divisions as basically a German army to be used elsewhere.

Speaker 1:          02:54:29       Now that's a complicated maneuver, but his strategy in 1917 as far as he's concerned, is going to be defense. So he's going to line things up and prepare for that. And it gives him all kinds of advantages. This is one area, it will be called the Hindenburg line that he puts together. It's hard to imagine making the defenses of 1916 deeper and stronger and more impenetrable, but that's what they do in 1917. The hindenburg line is an example of Luton. Doris idea of defense in depth. And what that means is as the German defenses go back and they're designed to act like a rubber band so that when something runs into them, it just stretches and stretches and stretches, and the farther it stretches, the more resistance you find. And then eventually just snaps back. It's devious mean the way it's designed and I don't need to get into all the details.

Speaker 1:          02:55:21       It's the machine guns and the barbed wire and the pillboxes and all these things, but they just go far back into the distance and there's no more trenches anywhere near the front lines because those are too easy to pick out and everybody just sort of sits in holes in the ground and the sort of a random pattern and there's no line. In fact, there's hardly any Germans when you first get to it. It's just a few Germans holding you up and taking casualties and then as soon as they can't keep you at bay anymore, they retreat back to the next line and then do the next line and every step of the way. The defenses are a little bit stronger and the Germans are a little bit more numerous. As the British or the French who are attacking them are getting less and less numerous and then as they're getting more tired.

Speaker 1:          02:56:00       I mean, I thought to myself, some of these defenses go back nine, 10 miles. It would kill me without any resistance. Imagine trying to do it with machine guns and rifle fire and grenades and artillery and I mean it just, it's. You just can't imagine having much left if you even get the nine or 10 miles to the end of the defenses and then waiting for you. There are German armies who are going to counterattack anything that's left that makes it all the way through these defenses. It is absolutely almost impenetrable and devious. If you only have two and a half, two point $8 million men to fight four or four and a half million men on the other side. This is a good way to equalize the odds. This is a weightlifter who's figured out a way to lift more than a bigger opponent.

Speaker 1:          02:56:49       My favorite part of the Hindenburg line defenses as a military history fan is that they build a giant moat in front of it. I mean, there's no other way to phrase it. It's an absolutely perpendicular wall trench that is between nine and 10 feet deep and 12 feet across. It's meant to stop everything tanks especially mean fall into there and won't be able to climb up the perpendicular side, but it's not an easy job for troops either and behind this giant moat, as you might imagine, our machine gun positions and all kinds of defenses and more wire and all these sorts of things. It is crazy to think about having to attack something like that and what's more when Luton Dorf has people retreat sort of toward the Hindenburg line and give up these positions that hundreds of thousands of Germans had died contesting over the last couple of years. He has soldiers destroy everything you know as they go, creating a dead zone from the old frontline to the new one, a scorched earth policy, something which by the way upset crown prince rubric to was the Field Marshal commanding some of the troops who had to do this destruction.

Speaker 3:          02:58:02       He was so upset. He almost resigned over it and complained about, you know, how this would hurt Germany's reputation. And in that discussion, you basically see a 19th century of figure with 19th century standards, crown prince rubric to member of the Bavarian royalty and Luton Dorf a thoroughly 20th century, total war kind of guy. It's a clash of cultures. The 20th century one Ludendorff got his way and the troops of the German army in a very old school style began creating a dead zone in this part of France in front of the Hindenburg line and a dead zone that extended in some places. Twenty miles, German soldier Ernst, young or was there watching the destruction take place. And he compares it to a kind of lunacy. I mean, it's funny because if you think about people doing this in the Second World War, you think about them using mostly explosives and they were explosives used to create this dead zone, but Germany needed her explosives.

Speaker 3:          02:59:00       And so a lot of this stuff was done by hand and younger says it had a bad effect on the troops. And he also blamed some of it on what he calls the economic times we live in or something like that. And what he really means by that is this total war 20th century sort of mentality younger writes about passing through this dead zone that was being created by the German army. As it moved backwards towards its main line quote, the villages we pass through on our way had the look of vast lunatic asylums. Whole companies were set to knocking or pulling down walls or sitting on rooftops, uprooting the tiles. Trees were cut down, windows smashed wherever you looked. Clouds of smoke and dust rose from vast piles of debris. We saw men dashing about wearing suits and dresses left behind by the inhabitants with top hats on their heads with destructive cunning.

Speaker 3:          02:59:54       They found the roof trees of the houses, fixed ropes to them, and then with concerted shouts polled until they all came tumbling down, others were swinging pile driving hammers and wind around smashing everything that got in their way from the flower pots on the window sills to whole ornate conservatories as far back as the siegfried line. That's what the Germans called the Hindenburg line. Every village was reduced to rubble. Every tree chopped down. Every road undermined every well poisoned. Every basement blown up or booby trapped, every rail unscrewed, every telephone wire rolled up. Everything burnable burned in a word. We were turning the country that are advancing. Opponents would occupy into a wasteland. As I say, he writes, the scenes were reminiscent of a madhouse and the effect on the men was similar. Half funny half repellent. They were also, we could see right away, bad for the men's morale and honor here for the first time I witnessed wanton destruction that I was later in life to see, to access.

Speaker 3:          03:00:55       This is something that has unhealthfully bound up with the economic thinking of our age, but it does more harm than good to the destroyer and dishonors the soldier and quote, and it should be remembered. The decision to award damaged country. This, this area that they are pulling apart now in creating a dead zone, was an idyllic part of France that wasn't touched by the war. If you weren't right on the front in the first world war, especially in the western front, things were great behind it. One of the complaints French soldiers on leave have is you can get 20 or 30 miles behind the front line and everything is like there's not even a war going on, you know, they see men with their sweethearts prowling around going to restaurants for dinner in a town 30 miles from the front, and it's like it's another world, so they're tearing down these beautiful parts of France to create this dead zone.

Speaker 3:          03:01:44       They're destroying everything and then they're leaving booby traps behind because when the Germans give up their positions, they're going to retreat. As I said, sometimes 20 miles in this one area all the way back to the main line. The allies are going to follow them when they follow them, they're going to run into these towns. When they run into these towns, they're going to run into and younger. Talked about it earlier, booby traps. Here's what he said, quote, among the surprises we prepared for our successors were some truly malicious inventions, very fine wires, almost invisible. We're stretched across the entrance of buildings and shelters, which set off explosive charges at the faintest touch in some places. Narrow ditches were dug, a crossroads and shells hidden in them. They were then covered over by a large plank and had earth strewn over them, and nail had been driven into the plank only just above the shelf use.

Speaker 3:          03:02:37       The space was measured so that marching troops could pass over the spot safely, but the moment the first truck or field gun rumbled up, the board would give and the nail would touch off the shell or there were spiteful time bombs that were buried in the basements of undamaged buildings. They consisted of two sections with a metal partition going down the middle in one part was explosive in the other acid. After these devils eggs, he calls them, had been primed and hidden. The acids slowly over weeks eroded the metal partition and then set off the bomb. In quote British reporter Philip Gibbs went through some of these towns right after younger and his men had vacated them, and allied forces had moved in and Gibb's talks about all those same kinds of booby traps and then says this quote, only a few of our men were killed or blinded by these monkey tricks. Are Engineers found most of them before they were touched off, but one went down dugouts or into ruin houses with a sense of imminent danger all through the devastated region. One walked with an uncanny feeling of an evil spirit left behind by the masses of men whose bodies had gone away. It exuded from scraps of old clothing. It was in the stench of the dugouts and in the ruins that they had made, and to quote a booby trap, dead zone, Lewd endorphins, a fully 20th

Speaker 1:          03:03:58       century total war commander,

Speaker 1:          03:04:03       and this is a big move. This is pulling a big rabbit out of a hat and it's, you know, if you're a military history fan like I am, it's what makes alluded door. So interesting. Not a lot of generals would pull this kind of stunt and it was a game changer in many respects. I mean that whole dead zone for example, proved to be a huge problem for British and French forces to try to overcome. They move into this cratered, destroyed denuded area where even the wells have been poisoned. How do you even supply that? The Germans on the other hand, they've moved to sites they'd been working on for months. Some parts of the Hindenburg line have had half a million workers working on it for months and months and months and building a new front line from scratch. It's like building a new home. It was now moving. Ready. They moved back into it and there are railroads bringing supplies up to the back. What Luton Dorf did was wrong foot. The allies he stolen night, March. He sees the initiative. He changed their plans for 1917 without knowing what their plans were. He simply figured, if I do this, all the planning they've been doing for months will be obsolete. They're planning to have me 20 miles closer to Paris than I am.

Speaker 1:          03:05:20       If you were an ally general, how would you deal with this problem? And if you said you don't want to deal with this problem, that this looks like an impenetrable nightmare, that just puts you in league with those military thinkers at the time who were known as easterners. These people who thought attacking on the western front was insane. Look at the defenses. Who would do that? The prime minister of Britain, Lloyd George is one of these guys.

Speaker 1:          03:05:46       Here's the thing though. You can always find generals and military commanders who no matter how impossible the military task looks, will be optimistic about explaining to you how their plan will overcome it after all, people don't get those jobs by explaining how they can't overcome the enemy's defenses. We told you earlier that the French sack, their military leader that they've had since the beginning of the wars you also shot for and they sort of, you know, kick him upstairs and before they do, they have another one of those yearly meetings where all the allies, the Russians and the British and the French and all the other allies, they get together and they had this meeting and they try to coordinate next years, military plans so that when the British and the French attack on the western front, the Russians at the same time attack on the east and the Italians attack in the south and everybody's pushing in multiple directions all at once. Forcing the Germans to, you know, maybe break somewhere. I mean, the central powers at this point are like an egg and as soon as you can break into any one of their sides, east, west, north, south, I mean you feel like the war would be over, but they're all holding steady, but most commanders are looking the western front and say, but nothing's as steady as that.

Speaker 1:          03:07:00       Must we attack it? Will the French had always believed, yes, you must. And of course they were a little biased because the Germans are on their soil and they would like to see them pushed off when Joseph Jaffra is asked in late 1916 at the big meeting, what are we going to do in 1917? What's the plan? Jennifer tells them his plan is a repetition of the somme. The battle that was just wrapping up the battle that was so horrible for British and even for French forces, gonna where the Germans down in, in, in, uh, several months long battle that forces them to throw in the last of their resources. French politicians were horrified by this. The last thing they wanted is a battle like that because as far as they were concerned, how did anybody know that it wouldn't be the French nation, the through in all their resources, and man, this is part of the reason is you offer got kicked upstairs. The French politicians had had enough just like British politicians. They were starting to do the unthinkable in terms of 19th century attitudes. They were starting to interfere with military decisions because they were losing faith that the people making the military decisions had the right priorities. The politicians were

Speaker 1:          03:08:10       worried about the casualty totals. One of the big criticisms, especially from the soldiers in the field, is that the generals weren't the guy who gets the job as the main allied military commander in 1917 we mentioned earlier is a guy named Robert and evil and evil gets this job because he's the guy out there optimistic about victory. Remember, generals do not get hired, promising to not overcome the enemy's defenses, so there's an ingrown bias in the whole process, but Robert and Israel tells the French leadership when he takes over that you don't have to have another battle of the somme. You don't have to have a grinding months, long battle. You can have a lightning bolt, sort of hammer stroke that just ends the war in 48 hours. Now it sounds crazy, doesn't it? There were a bunch of French general, some of whom Nouvelle leapfrogged over. Uh, they were guys who probably deserved the job at least three, maybe four more than Nevada, but Nevada was this. He's a charmer. I mean, he's, he's one of these people that can win anyone over. He's not winning over these jealous generals. He leapfrogged. But there's a lot of politicians that are, are sold with Nivo and some of them aren't. Even French novel has this great advantage over the other French,

Speaker 1:          03:09:33       you know, military leaders, he speaks English, he speaks it perfectly. He speaks it without an accent. His mother's English. So he's a charmer to begin with kind of a salesman. But people like him, he doesn't feel slimy or sleazy. Um, he sort of an optimist and he goes over to Britain and he wins over even the arch easterner Lloyd George

Speaker 1:          03:09:57       that was in there and explains to the British exactly how this plan to rupture the enemy lines will work and it involves creating a reserve of 27, 28 divisions that are going to be like the spider in the web and as soon as the Germans are held in certain places and weakened and then this 27 divisions will go get them and it's going to take 48 hours. And like any good salesman offering sort of a money back guarantee, there's a guarantee in this deal. And the guarantee that naval tells everybody is if it doesn't work in 48 hours, we'll call it off after that. Now that's a promise to get rid of the part of these battles that's most troubling to people who care about dead people. A lot of the dead people, unless you have just tragic first day, it's like the battle of the Somme and the battle of the frontiers. A lot of the deaths happen because these battles go on for months. If you could end them after 48 hours, if you had a chance to see is it working or not working, call it off. It's not working. That takes a lot of the risk out of it and you can see why politicians would like that plan a lot more than just saying let's have another four or five months long battle.

Speaker 1:          03:11:03       The problem is, in hindsight, as everyone knows, nouvelle was working on a on an idea that might not have been tenable.

Speaker 1:          03:11:12       Novell made his name at the battle of Verdun at the very last stages of it. When the Germans were being pushed back in the other direction. There's a lot of historical debate over whether or not anything novel did was effective, but even if it was effective, it was effective at a very, very low level to all of a sudden be the military leader in charge of not just all of Francis forces, but kind of Britain's forces to who he will clash and avail will clash with Britain's commander Douglas Haig. They do not like each other. The Egos of generals, our proverbial anyway, and these two guys will fight in them, will create problems between Britain and France as allies. Nonetheless, novellas, the most powerful military commander on the western front. He's never commanded forces like this. His first real problem happens when the Germans pull this, you know, operation Albert and disappear and it reminds me a little of the British getting away at Gullapalli and fooling the Turks so that the Turks didn't know that they'd left. Now the Germans just kind of pull back from this giant salient and wait for the British to find out they're gone.

Speaker 1:          03:12:16       And I love the way it starts by the way it starts with, with the British looking out over their trenches and seeing the German trenches being shelled and then coming to the realization that the German trenches that they, that they're facing off against her being shelled by Germans and it's a German artillery blowing up the trenches and destroying everything of value in it and then destroying the trenches so the British can't move up into them and use them. And then of course the probing. It must have been Erie. There were like single Germans left behind to shoot a rifle off every now and then and just keep the allied armies from pursuing too closely, but it was clear that the Germans were pulling back, you know, miles and miles, churchill had said like 50 miles. Every place I read said more like 20 at the farthest, but nonetheless to pull back that far means your military maps are all different.

Speaker 1:          03:13:03       The place that the hammer blow in nibbles offensive was going to fall is the place Luton Dorf just vacated. Okay, so as Ludina are probably intended, you got to change your plans, don't you mean conditions on the ground? That changed and evolved said, I don't have to change my plans. This all helps my goal and this is where everything starts to fall apart in this plan, and yet at the same time you can see how these are such huge affairs involving so many months of preparation, so much momentum that even if you find out near the beginning of the of the battle that things have changed. There's a momentum that you can't really even stop. In this case, everything starts going wrong. For interval before the whole battle starts, nonetheless, before knievel's part of the battle starts the campaign that sort of a diversionary campaign designed to make the Germans move away from where the is going to attack starts. That's the part of this campaign that involves the British and the dominion forces. It happens, um, next to the French position at a place called Rs. And at this battle for at least a few days, everyone gets a chance to see exactly how you would go about striking defenses as invincible as the Germans. And it looks a lot like world war two.

Speaker 1:          03:14:31       And you know, several historians have pointed out that by the end of the first world war, the armies are prodo second world war armies. There are certain battles though during the war where you can say, Aha, there is a big step forward towards that Second World War 20th century style of fighting. That's what the battle of Eros is known for. Now, in the grand scheme of things, as we said, this is the spring offensive. This is what the allies do every year, right? The weather gets good and spring we launched an offensive, the British and the French launch one together, or they launched one in tandem. The Italians do, as we said, I mean they launch them everywhere. The Russians. This is the big spring offensive. The British part is these sort of diversion as we said, and yet they're going to pull this off initially so well. They're going to show everyone what 20th century combined arms warfare looks like, including aircraft. The amount of coordination though that has to come off correctly to make this work is stunning and it can't be maintained, but for the short period of time they're able to make it work. The British show you that modern combined arms warfare can devastate these static defenses.

Speaker 1:          03:15:42       Here's the way historian Peter Harte describes the many things that were starting to come together that could be unleashed at Eros and how scientific and modern 20th

Speaker 3:          03:15:50       century this profession of arms is really becoming. He writes, quote, many lessons had been learned from the Psalm, and artillery was at the heart of the plans and the royal artillery had come a long way since 1915. The thousands upon thousands of new recruits had learned their trade well. That gun detachments, the layers the NCO is the officers were all now wedded into efficient batteries that were capable of increasingly sophisticated and complex bombardments. The guns themselves were now plentiful and there were vast numbers of medium and heavy artillery pieces joining the masses of ordinary 18 pounder and four and a half inch, how it's your field, artillery advances in technology and science also combined to give a greater understanding of the mechanics of a shell in flight and the measurable adjustments caused by different media. A logical conditions accuracy was improving and the advent of the [inaudible] fuse meant that shells would burst instantaneously on the slightest contact, which made clearing barbed wire and great deal.

Speaker 3:          03:16:51       Simpler smoke shells were also now routinely incorporated into the barrages to try to mask the attacking infantry from German defenders. Gas shells were a key part of the barrages and they were less visually dramatic than the clouds of gas released from cylinders, but they were far easier to deploy and much more predictable in their effects. Progress in the linked tasks. A photographic reconnaissance and artillery observation allowed targets to be identified and then destroyed by indirect fire. New techniques, a flash spotting and sound ranging also assisted in locating the exact positions of German batteries and the amount of coordination that has to come off correctly to make this stuff work is astounding and it shouldn't be surprising that it usually doesn't. What makes her us different is that in some cases it did at the battle of Rs. Take for example, the creeping barrage, the creeping barrage is a fantastic military innovation and they'd been trying to make it work before this battle in this battle.

Speaker 3:          03:17:51       They got it right in this battle. They were able for a while to create a protective explosive force field around British troops. The way it worked is you would get a ton of guns anywhere from several hundred to more than a thousand firing giant cannon aids in front of your advancing forces, creating a wall of explosions in front of them and you would have it coordinated. Everybody would have their watch is synchronized and the troops would be told, okay, in the first 20 minutes you were to move, you know, 100 yards forward and at this time the barrage will shift another hundred yards in front of you. So this was all worked out so that you know the protective barraged supposed to keep the troops safe as the, as they advance toward the enemy. And the very last step of course is the barrage will land right on the enemy and then it will lift at the last second and the enemy will look up and the British forces will be right there standing in front of them. Having marched the whole with a giant explosive force field, protecting them. As you might imagine, coordination is critical. You screwed this up in one of two things happens. The better thing is that the barrage gets way ahead of the troops and they're exposed to all the machine gunfire and all the stuff that barrage was supposed to protect them from. That's the good part. That's the best outcome. The worst outcome is that the barrage short and that giant explosive wall that's supposed to protect you from the enemy instead decimates you.

Speaker 3:          03:19:15       When it works, it's fantastic. At the battle of our us, it works. Initially,

Speaker 3:          03:19:22       there'll be a bunch of innovations at this battle. Another one, again that has been tried before but never quite like this, as whole batteries have machine guns will be used in what's called indirect fire, meaning they point them up to the sky so that the bullets ended up falling. You know? Right. Straight down on targets. You could shoot over hills that way. Not even seeing what you're shooting at is one. A historian explained it. It's like hosing down an important piece of ground and they would have thousands of machine gun bullets falling every second on some of these important road crossings and whatnot. All through this battle.

Speaker 3:          03:19:58       One of the important elements at the start of the battle is that so many of the troops that are going to initially rush the German side, our underground at the start of the battle, there's a lot of chalky ground in this part of France and like a lot of these battles, there will be a ton of digging. In fact, four months the Germans and the British on both sides have had sort of a tunneling war and occasionally, you know, British tunnels toward the German front run into German tunnelers going the other way and they had these terrible gun fights in the dark under ground. You know, like troglodyte fighting.

Speaker 3:          03:20:30       Some sources say that. The moment the actual ground battle at a Ross started, some of these tunnels had gone up all the way to the German lines, but just a couple of feet separated them from the German trench lines and that at the second the battle started. They exploded. Charges in those, those little walls of dirt blew down. And the Canadians, you know, storm through the breaches. It doesn't matter what exactly happened. The Canadian storm wme Ridge now and took it on the first day, a ridge that untold numbers of Frenchman had died trying to take back in 1915. It's a huge Canadian victory and the Germans were in terrible trouble for a short while at the battle of ours. And by the way, it's not just Canadians. They get a lot of credit and deservedly so, but there were Scotsman, for example, up on the same hill. I'm dealing with all kinds of problems.

Speaker 4:          03:21:21       Okay,

Speaker 3:          03:21:22       and yet for the first 24 hours, it looked like Douglas Haig, the British commander was going to have on his hands the long awaited, much fantasized about in his head breakthrough

Speaker 3:          03:21:37       Ludin Dorf writes in his diaries that he was a a dangerous moment and then and then lamented the fact that here this brand new defense in system he'd come up with, with all this work and all this money spent was apparently useless against these new British combined arms tactics. That was until he figured out that his commander on the scene, a guy named Falcon House and a 70 something year old guy, hadn't quite figured out what he was supposed to do with these new tactics. They were still way too new and he had done a bunch of things that were part of the old tactics. He put all his guys for the most part way up front where they could be taken by the artillery more than two and a half million British shells by the way, fired a in a shorter time than the battle of the somme, and then he put his reserves that are supposed to be there to plug any holes 15 miles back too far to do anything in for a short period of time.

Speaker 3:          03:22:28       It looked like the British were going to break through at this battle and then just like all these other battles, it slows down. Once the troops advanced beyond where they're gunfire can help them, then the guns behind them have to move to and that takes time and everybody gets tired and they begin to wear out and while they're resting and rejuvenating themselves for the next push, the Germans are bringing up their reserves and the battle of Arras with this wonderful first day in this capture of this important vimy ridge turns into just another one of these battles. And by the time it's over, more than a month later, you have like 150,000 British casualties and like 130,000 German ones. And by the way, I found it interesting that the newer histories, numbers of the casualties, these battles is significantly higher than the older ones. I have some that say that 75,000 British died at this battle.

Speaker 3:          03:23:23       That's a big discrepancy in the numbers. Nonetheless, the traditional numbers thrown out today are well over 100,000 for both sides. Um, the, the joy over vinny was short lived. And what had happened at this battle would happen at a bunch of other first world war battles. It shows the difference between how well the first stage, usually the first 24, maybe 36 hours of these minute Lee exquisitely planned encounters go the part that's all been rehearsed and trained for for months and months and months goes great and you're able to make the coordination work, but then the next jump in wherever you are in these battles is the part that becomes much more improvisational, much more ad hoc. You can't have a plan, you know months in advance for what you do on the second day of the battle because you're not really sure where you're going to be the second day.

Speaker 3:          03:24:13       You may have some, but that doesn't mean that's what you're going to do and and as many historians point out, when you look at the next jumps in any of these offensive, they are so much more haphazard and all that coordination falls apart that you don't see the wonderful results that that months of preparation gave you for 24 or 36 hours. And yet you can't break through these kinds of deep defenses in that short of a period of time. You would have to have that combined arms activity work as well as it did for the first 24 hours at a Ross and be able to carry it through for a week or two. Nevertheless, it was a near run thing. It's gone down in history as a, as a, as a heroic encounter. Mostly for the Canadians, the largest endeavor they participated in yet on the western front, and I always have to remind myself, you know, you look at this in an almost a field marshal type fashion.

Speaker 3:          03:25:04       When you study this for military history, you see it the way the generals often did these advancements on these maps. What worked and what didn't. You know the coordination question that the technical side of war. You always have to remember though, and I always try to remind myself to the people on the ground. This is not so technical. Philip Gibbs was there. He was in the tunnels with the troops as they came back from these encounters up on vimeo ridge and places like that. Gibbs gives you a real feel for what it was like. He writes, quote, there were tunnels beneath Ross through which are men advanced to the German lines, and I went along them when one line of men was going into battle and another was coming back wounded, some of them blind bloody vomiting with the fumes of gas in their lungs. Their steel hats clinking as they groped past one another.

Speaker 3:          03:25:54       Involves on each side of these passages. Men played cards on barrels to the light of candles, stuck in bottles or slept until their turn to fight with gas masks for their pillows. He says outside the citadel, meaning of the city. There were long queues of wounded men taking their turn to the surgeons who were working in a deep crypt with a high vaulted roof. One day there were 3000 of them. Silent patient, muddy bloodstained, blind boys or men with smashed faces, swapped in bloody rags, groped forward to the dark passages leading to the vault, led by comrades on the grass outside lay men with leg wounds and stomach wounds. And the quote, Norman Collins is an officer with the Scottish fourth seaforth highlanders, and they're there to. And Collins just tells these stories that reminds you of the very strange moral positions, these kinds of conflicts puts you in.

Speaker 3:          03:26:55       Collins talks about the fact that they were actually shown how to kill one of their own men on the battlefield because of the pain and suffering that they were enduring. And this isn't specific to this battle, this happened on the battlefields throughout the first world war in basically every army you know that got caught in these conditions. These are human problems, the physics of humankind on these 20th century battlefields. The results are predictable, horrifying, and pitiable collins writes, quote, after such intense fighting, you always had men lying out in no man's land, probably with their testicles blown off and crying in agony and laying out there all night long in the dark, in the rain, most would never have survived, but you had a choice. They could die in agony or you could shoot them. You were shown how to do the thing very cleanly.

Speaker 3:          03:27:51       You would take your 45 revolver and talk to the man and kneel behind him and whilst you were talking, pulled the trigger, put a bullet through the back of his head and immediately the whole front skull came away and they were dead instantly. There was no pain about it, but I can honestly say this, that I never had the courage because that's what it took. I never had the courage myself to shoot a wounded soldier. I carried out the operation many times afterwards on animals. I could kill a pet dog far better than a vet could, but I was never able to shoot a wounded soldier. I probably should have. My friend auto, Murray Dixon was wounded in the stomach and the irs attack in April. He was in great agony from what I was told. The kindest thing would've been to shoot him on the battlefield. Instead of that, they took him back to the hospital and he died two days later. It's a tremendous thing to shoot a friend even though he's in agony and I just didn't have the courage to do it. Most of them died overnight, but of course they didn't. Thank you for it. I'm sure the quote,

Speaker 3:          03:28:50       there are battles coming up with the numbers of people who were either shot by their own men or begged to be will skyrocket. Nonetheless, this battle was tough enough. The initial stages of elation at taking things like Vimeo Ridge became

Speaker 3:          03:29:13       nightmarish. As the month went on and the casualties piled up before long, the British were suffering for thousand casualties a day at a Ross and it was getting to the morale of the troops. Gibbs tells a story about arriving on a scene right after a bunch of men just behind the front had been blown up in their bath together and the bath is strewn with body parts and blood and he and a soldier he knows sits down to talk about you know how things are going, and the soldier is clearly at the end of his rope as far as what he's willing to put up with. He writes, quote, a few minutes before our meeting, a shell had crashed into a bath close to their hut where men were watching themselves. The explosion filled the bath with blood and bits of flesh. The younger officers stared at me under the tilt forward of his steel hat and said, hello gibbs. I'd played chess with him at grooms cafe in fleet street in days before the war. I went back to his hut and had tea with him close to that bath, hoping we should not get caught up with the cake and quote.

Speaker 3:          03:30:19       Now, this battle, as I said, is known for how wonderfully competent the integration of all the different elements were to make this battle so effective. That's not how the guy on the ground sees it. Though Gibbs says that his friend he's having tea with says quote. I had heard before, some harsh words about our general staff work, but never anything so passionate, so violent, is from that gunner officer. His view of the business was summed up in the word murder. He raged against the impossible orders sent down from headquarters against the brutality with which men were left in the line week after week and against the monstrous abominable futility of all our so called strategy. His nerves were in rags, as I could see, by the way in which his hands shook. When he lighted one cigarette after another, his spirit was in a flame of revolt against the misery of his sleeplessness, filth and imminent peril of death and quote. If British reporter Philip Gibbs thinks that that's a high level of discontent and perhaps in the British army, it is. You ought to see what's going on in the French army at about the same time

Speaker 3:          03:31:31       in France, a great drama is unfolding during this time period because right before these offensives are scheduled to start, the French government falls and new political leaders take over a new president, a new war minister. All these civilian leaders have changed and these civilian leaders have a very different attitude towards this offensive that's about to start than the people they succeeded. This causes huge problems. The first thing is, they're not big fans of novel, but join the club. There are lots of people who wonder why this guy got the top job when there were several, you know, superior figures, really August people who could have gotten it. Potassium follow people like that were sitting in the wings and they gave it to a much more junior person, but, but for political reasons, I mean he fit that last government in ways that were good for that last government, but now that last government was gone and the new one that comes into power would've rather had any one of those other people.

Speaker 3:          03:32:26       What's more, they don't like his plan, his idea for this great thunderbolts assault with all this artillery that's going to end the war in 48 hours. They're not buying it. A lot of people are, by the way, a lot of people are drinking the Robert Nouvelle Koolaid and getting into this optimistic mood about this thunderbolt ending the war, but the new government's pretty sure that that's not what's going to happen and they've got some people who ought to know sending the message. Just warning them. There are other military commanders in France who are saying, call this thing off. It's going to be a disaster. Some of them are people who are actually subordinate to Nevada and who have jobs to do in this coming offensive that scaring the government. As you might imagine,

Speaker 3:          03:33:13       this is all part of this growing interference with politicians in the affairs of generals and this is one of those times where there sort of a face off I'm eating is called between the new war minister and novel in late March and the new war minister wants to convince devel to call this whole offensive off and they're almost impossible thing to do. As we said earlier, by the time you reach stages where you're just finishing the last touches ready to go. It's taken months and months and the training and the rehearsals and the money spent and all this stuff, and now the government, the civilian leaders who don't know anything about war, any general would think want to call it off. My reputation relies on this. I mean there's a lot of personal motives and the war minister has some good arguments. He tries to tell him, look, everything's changed since you first formulated this plan. When did just be prudent to reevaluate?

Speaker 3:          03:34:09       I mean, the Germans pulled back from their old positions to these new positions on the siegfried line and other places, right? There's one big change, but not just that the war minister tries to make the case that all of these big events are happening right now. These trends coming together, everything we've talked about on this program up to date are coming to the fore at the same time in late March when the war minister is talking to novel about this, the United States is just about to get in the war and everyone knows it. The Russian revolution has just happened. The submarines are about to enter into the month where they sink. Eight hundred and 40,000 tons of allied shipping. There's a lot going on and Francis warm minister tries to tell Nevada lit, listen, no one's going to hold you. I mean, everything's changed. Maybe we should reevaluate. Novel says, no.

Speaker 3:          03:35:02       The government gets even more desperate as the offensive nears and presses him and he pulls the takeaway card. He says to the government, either you back me on this or I resigned, and everything I've read says that this is a crisis for the French government at this point for all sorts of internal reasons. It was likely to bring the government down if they fired novell right before his offensive was supposed to take hold and everyone had bought into the optimism and drank the Koolaid. They had almost no choice in this confrontation between politicians and generals and the government backed down, but it was even worse than the government knew because the Germans knew all about novels, plans in detail to major incidents. Uh, one involving captured documents that never should have been anywhere near the front lines that the Germans got their hands on in a, in a raid, and then an officer that they captured.

Speaker 3:          03:35:54       And we're able to find out more. The Germans knew all about the French plans and when they were going to take place and what was going to happen. And they had known in general for months, air reconnaissance had told them. I mean, these giant affairs are like giant supply dumps that go on for miles and miles and miles. It's very difficult to keep the enemy from finding out about it, and in January, the Germans had about nine divisions, opposite novell's armies by the time novels about to launch this attack. The Germans have 48 and they're waiting and it's a disaster.

Speaker 3:          03:36:29       Historian holds your. Her vague writes quote, after several delays due to foul weather novel 16th, April unleashed is our telleria for nine days, and then mounted is infantry charge in driving rain reports from agents and French pow, who's had tipped the Germans off to the coming offensive. Given the news of the offensive and the difficulty of the terrain, the Germans were able to halt the main attack before it got beyond their first line. Whereas novell had forecast a penetration of seven or eight miles on the opening day. The French rarely advanced, more than one or two miles. Losses were horrendous. Whereas novell had coldly predicted 10,000 casualties. For the first day. The number was 10 times greater after the war. The historical surface of the French general staff placed casualties for the first four days of the offensive at 30,000 killed, 100,000 wounded and 4,000 missing end quote. The story of what happened at this battle of novels is a wonderful

Speaker 3:          03:37:32       no demonstration of how many things can go wrong when you're trying to synchronize everything. So carefully start with the weather. Just like at a Ross, a week before the weather was bad. Uh, you know, who has snow during a spring offensive, but that's what the French face, sleet, snow, rain, creating mud that slowed the progress of the infantry, which had been calculated precisely to keep up with the explosive force field of the creeping barrage, which this guy in the veil had pioneered back in for done but never on this kind of a scale. And in this case, the barrage, the force field got way ahead of the troops exposing the troops to just unbelievable amounts of machine gunfire. There's one part of this front where the French have to travel for ever. I mean, miles to take this,

Speaker 3:          03:38:21       you know, height in the distance and and in, in this ridge, they've, the Germans have cut all these little holes into the side of it, you know, to, to add to the ravines and the gorgeous and everything that are already in it, and they've stuffed machine guns into every hole that you can fit into this hillside. They've got about 4,000 of them trained on this French infantry trying to cross this space and at Eros and here, you know when you read the history books, they sound like relatively productive first world war battles because the soldiers actually take quite a bit more ground than they did in the earlier battles. But that's sort of deceiving because this is all part of the new German strategy. This defense in depth with the Germans aren't supposed to fight to the depth all up on the front lines now and not give an inch of ground. They're supposed to fight to a reasonable degree and then retire to the next line of defense. So they're letting the enemy have more ground. They're just killing more of them while they retreat. The French actually stumble in to these, uh, first line areas and think that they're winning because they're just not finding that many Germans. And then the Germans opened up on them from the second line positions,

Speaker 3:          03:39:32       as you might imagine, a

Speaker 4:          03:39:33       government that had been assured that they'll call this thing off in 48 hours. You know, it was going to try to cash in on that guarantee. They actually gave novel and extra day on his 48 our promise. Here's how writer Gj Meyer describes the situation where the politicians come to the general and tell him to call the whole thing off. Now you guaranteed it wasn't going to be another song. You guaranteed we're going to win the war with this thunderbolt. And here's what my writes quote. On April 19th, three days after the attack starts, the war minister intervened, trying to get Lavelle to stop the general who in demanding approval of his grand plan had promised to call it off. If a breakthrough were not achieved within 48 hours, refused the very next day, he found that his chagrin however, that he had no choice but to pause the divisions at the front. We're breaking down both their morale and their supplies of ammunition dangerously low laid on the day after that, April 21st a new phenomenon appeared and quote

Speaker 3:          03:40:41       John Keegan among other historians has gone to great length to point out how there's an accordion like backup that begins once the timetable is Intel to strictly when the, when the front elements of these French forces get bogged down, everything behind it gets traffic jammed. We've quoted Louis Bar toss a French. I'm corporal in the story several times and Bartos is at this battle, but he never sees anything. He gets stuck in one of these traffic jams and as far as he knows something's going on, a mile or two in front of him, but he doesn't ever get there to find out what it is, the soldiers who find out what it is though, begin to react, as one might imagine from the horror, and in this case, the tip of the spear in one of these areas are French colonial troops.

Speaker 3:          03:41:29       The story of what happened was relayed to British journalists. Philip Gibbs who writes, quote, talking about the French infantry here, Gibb's talks about how the French were lured into the lightly defended first zone only to be attacked by the Germans. In the second zone of defense, he writes, quote, they were to be allowed an easy walk through to their death trap. That is what happened. The French infantry advancing with masses of black troops in the colonial corps in the frontline of assault, all exultant in inspired by a belief in victory, swept through the forward zone of the German defenses, astonished and then disconcerted by the scarcity of Germans until an annihilating barrage fire dropped upon them and smash their human waves from French officers and nurses. I heard appalling tails of this tragedy. The death wail of the black troops froze the blood of the freshmen with horror. Their own losses were immense in a bloody shambles and quote, the French colonial soldiers which had been thrown into this disaster, ran screaming back towards their own lines, yelling piece down with the war, death to those who are responsible and all of a sudden the French army began to collapse.

Speaker 3:          03:42:49       Traditionally, the novel offensive is seen as the straw that breaks the camel's back for the French military. And it's ironic that it would be that way because if it's just judged in relation to all the other French battles, the novella, fancy is not terrible. The casualty bill is horrifying, but pretty normal for these big battles. And remember, there's people being killed every day on so called quiet fronts, I mean the British casualties every week to what they call wastage, just living on the western front with snipers and bombs and trench raids and all that is 5,000 people a week. So I mean even between the big battles, it's horrible. But in the big battles, the numbers are astronomical by that standard. The novella fence is not that bad and they did gain, you know, a pretty decent amount of ground level three miles in some places. But this was sold in a completely different way. The salesmen, Robert Nevada, sold this as the thunderbolt that wins the war. Everybody's got to have this last push of optimism and and strength and resources and gumption to end the war. And then we can all go home and the sufferings over and a lot of people drank the Koolaid and the crash after they drank the Koolaid was worse than if they'd never had the Koolaid at all.

Speaker 3:          03:44:00       All that optimism boomeranged back on Nevada who started to try to recast the marketing just 24 hours into the conflict. He was no longer talking about war winning thunderbolts. He was talking about, hey, it's going very well, modest gains in the sector in this sector, and no one was buying the recrafting of the marketing strategy. The French government now has a wonderful little drama on its hands where it tries to get rid of Nevada and he won't go quietly. They put pitocin who's very competent. We talked about him earlier in novels, old job, and uh, they have a face off and you see this wonderful again, changing the guard between politicians, kind of trying to assert their authority over the generals and this push and tug on who's going to be the ultimate authority. The one thing that the politicians have in their favor is that they're concerned about casualties and the generals appear to not be concerned about casualties and the people who are rising up in French units up and down the western front are very concerned about casualties. The novella offensive traditionally is what kicks off what are called the [inaudible] 19, 17 mutinies or the mutinies of 1917. That's a weird term and it makes it sound like one unit, rebels, and then the rebellion know transfers like wildfire up and down the front end and all these units are acting simultaneously. If that had happened, the war would've been over for France.

Speaker 3:          03:45:27       I mean, what do you do to stop a rebellion or when it's the army that's rebelling. If that had happened, it would've been all over and the French government knew it and acted accordingly. Instead, you have to imagine a burning roof with the is everywhere, you know, going off into the wind and landing all over the dry grass on the lawn and you know, the French government is running around stamping out fires as they catch hold as many as six of these units a day. We're involved in, as I said, what the French called acts of collective and discipline, which meant a whole wide range of things. Sometimes it meant getting drunk as an entire unit and that was the end of that. We're not going anywhere. Other Times they just refuse to go up to the front. One forest decided to march on Paris and was talked out of that at the last minute, and a lot of this was tied to the Russian revolution going on simultaneously. The French in the field saw that all of a sudden Russian soldiers, maybe we're going to get out of fighting this work as they'd somehow with the people acted together to go after the people that were as Louis Bar Toast explained it, enslaving them,

Speaker 3:          03:46:34       Louis Bartos, who a socialist and who would have viewed these happenings in Petrograd in Russia with great enthusiasm, wrote this right around the times. The outbreaks of collective in discipline are happening in his army. Quote, at this time, the Russian revolution broke out. Those Slavic soldiers only yesterday and slaved and bent double under the weight of iron discipline unknowingly marched off to mass, occurs like resigned. Slaves had thrown off their yolks, proclaim their liberty and imposed piece on their masters. Their hangman. The whole world was stupefied petrified by this revolution, this collapse of the immense empire of the czars. These events had repercussions on the western front and throughout the French ranks. A wind of revolt blew across almost all the regiments and quote, but as I said, it was an uneven sort of an affair. Sometimes it involved whole units, large numbers of troops. Other Times it was a decision made by single individuals alone that they just weren't going to have their lives thrown into a meat grinder anymore. Historian Eric Dorm Bros tries to give you a sense of the feeling when he writes, quote

Speaker 3:          03:47:48       already on day two of the novel offensive. 17 soldiers have one regiment left their post and went to the rear, and then in May 30,000 infantry men abandoned the line. A junior officer recorded the scene at one train station receiving men who'd been rotated out of the line. Now Bros is quoting and eye witness and the eyewitness to the troops. Getting away from the front during this rebellious time says, quote, as soon as the train enters with what you would say a horde of savages, all the doors open on both sides and men flood out on the platforms, shouts, insults and threats flying all direction, death to the sugars at home, murderers, pigs, that

Speaker 1:          03:48:28       they are long lived, the revolution down with the war. It's peace we want, et cetera. Now, Bros picks up the narrative, quote the troubles spread the 68 of 112 divisions in the French army in June. Each reporting one to five mutinous incidents, but no killing of officers. The rank and file demanded an end to further attacks, better pay and living conditions and more furloughs and quote John Keegan and a couple of other historians have an interesting way of describing this. This act of rebellion that was breaking out almost spontaneously, although influenced by other breakouts all across and up and down the western front. He says it's like a labor strike.

Speaker 1:          03:49:11       Like the soldiers had just decided that they weren't going to do certain things anymore. He said it wasn't defeatism. It was defensive ism, meaning that these soldiers were not gonna, let the Germans come and invade France. They weren't going to abandon the line and they wouldn't stop fighting, but they weren't going to be involved in any more of these offensives were 130, a hundred 40, a hundred 50,000 of them were going to become casualties in a hopeless cause. Let's also remember that it didn't get to this point until the French army had suffered in three and a half years about as many killed as the United States has suffered in all its wars put together. How would the United States today, a nation of 300 million, France, had about 39 or 40 deal with one point five or one point 7 million dead in four years. You adjusted for population size, that'd be more like seven, seven and a half million, somewhere around there. Can you imagine? Would you expect us to be hangover free for the rest of the century in terms of military affairs? The French had some lingering damage because of this first world war. Anyone else would. It's amazing. They got back on their feet at all. It's also sort of a wonder for the allied cause that the Germans are unaware of this somehow. It's. It's funny, you have the novel offensive that everybody in Germany is talking about on the streets. It's so well known and yet the French Army starts falling apart and rebelling and the Germans don't know.

Speaker 1:          03:50:42       If you're the French high command and you got your army, you know, starting to catch fire like a bunch of rooftop ambers that are falling on dry grass. What do you do to stop that? You got to be very careful, don't you? If you give up too much, it becomes like what the Russians are dealing with where you can't even have the troops in order to run, where they start electing their own little governing groups and they do what they want. Can't have that, but if you crack down and get all tough on them, you might spread the revolution. It's a deft and terrible tight rope for the French government to walk. This new military leader that takes over for novell Patala is considered to be sort of a soldier's general, so that helps and he'll famously go around to all these units speaking to them and actually promising and delivering some of

Speaker 3:          03:51:26       the reforms they want. For example, reforms on home leave, food, drink. I mean there's a bunch of things that he can manage to perk up and, and take care of that help the troops, you know, griping on the front. At the same time, he has to show who's still in charge. This is still a military. Laws are broken. Discipline must be maintained. The French start a crackdown in July. In 1917, they will court marshal almost 24,000 soldiers for collective indiscipline delish issue about 500 death sentences. They will actually carry out less than 100 of them, but there's one thing pitocin can change. He cannot make this army capable or willing or trustworthy to go on another major offensive. This is an army that has to regroup, be rebuilt. Refortified in Bhutan is going to do a historically famous job of this, but it's going to take time and in the meantime, the number one thing that he gives to his troops that they were asking for because he's got no choice, is that they're not going to be thrown into murderous, hopeless, offensives anytime soon. This leaves the western front in any sort of offensive activity on it for the rest of 1917 to the British alone,

Speaker 3:          03:52:39       the British commander Douglas Haig is fine with that because he has a plan and he's wanting to carry it out for some time and now that the French are not in his way, he casts his covetous I on Oprah and the Belgian ports, yet again, Douglas Haig, the British military leader launched the British to launch an attack on the German defenses in Belgium at Ipa where there's already been two battles of Epri in this war already.

Speaker 3:          03:53:12       Now, Hague's got a great army to do this with the British army in late 1917. Mid 1917. Is is maybe the best army in the war at this time. It's taken years for the British. You know, traditionally a sea power to build up a land power, but by July, August, 19, 17, they've done a great job of doing just that and it's millions strong in the British, had a boutique army when this war started. Very, very fine and professional and volunteers, but, but a boutique army. What they have in 1917 are a bunch of mostly conscripts, some volunteers, but mostly conscripts. They don't sing on their way to and from battle anymore. Like in 1914 after the psalm that all stopped. These are a bunch of grim professionals who operate with deadly efficiency and have a sort of a, a, a morale that's hard to describe it and they suffered a terrible ordeal the year before at the battle of the somme. Terrible. Lost a lot of fantastic people, but came back with even more artillery pieces here in 1917. It's a great tool in the hands of Haig and hade wants to use it in Belgium against the Germans.

Speaker 3:          03:54:19       But there are people that think that that's a stupid idea. And after several years of

Speaker 1:          03:54:24       war, when you've watched, you know, the same thing happen over and over again in all these battles, there are people that are going to push back and you're starting to see some of these political leaders start to question what the military is doing openly to their face. And you know, when we mentioned this earlier, I didn't want to insinuate that this never happens. I mean Abraham Lincoln for example, famously would argue with the civil war generals and they would resent it. But in some countries like Germany, politicians in Germany do not interfere in military strategy and they'd only just started doing that in France with the collapse of the Novella offensive, right? It was the novella offensive that sort of brought them into saying, are you sure we want to do something like this again in Britain? You know, I, I would think as a modern person reading the story, and I think many of you probably thought the same thing. You're wondering why it took this long. How many times can you lose hundreds of thousands of people in what appeared to the nonmilitary. I to be very similar kinds of attacks. It'd be a little strange if there weren't more people questioning this in Britain. There are led by the Prime Minister Lloyd George.

Speaker 1:          03:55:28       Now George, to be fair is viewed by history very similarly to the way woodrow Wilson is. It's almost as though there's a good lawyer George, and there's an evil Lloyd George and you know different histories will portray him differently, but taken at face value. Lloyd George presents himself as the person who defends the soldiers from the generals. He says during this whole lead in to whether or not hey gets to have his Belgian offensive quote.

Speaker 3:          03:55:58       The cabinet must regard themselves as trustees for the fine fellows that constitute our army. They're willing to face any dangers and they do so without complaint, but they trusted the leaders of the nation to see that their lives are not needlessly thrown away and that they're not sacrificed on mere gambles which are resorted to merely because those who are directing the war can think of nothing better to do with the men under their command. It is therefore imperative that before we embark upon a gigantic attack, which must necessarily entail the loss of scores of thousands of valuable lives and produce that sense of discouragement which might very well rush nations into premature piece, that we should feel a fair confidence that such an attack as a reasonable chance of succeeding Amir gamble would be both

Speaker 1:          03:56:45       folly and a crime. And to quote, I must confess that to the modern observer having just witnessed the several years previous of this war, you think to yourself when you hear something like that, it's about damn time, but many modern historians wonder. They wonder if Haig didn't have a pretty good feel for this thing and that these politicians, we're barking up the wrong tree. Maybe for their own political purposes. Haig sure makes it look like Lloyd George doesn't know what he's talking about when he opens an operation

Speaker 3:          03:57:22       on June seventh, 19, 17. To take this high ground that he needs to take before he can have his IEP or battle. It's called Misener Ridge and the British had since 1915. Been tunneling under this eight miles of ridge lines and planting explosives underneath the incredibly deep and complicated German defenses up there. They were impenetrable, so the British went underneath them and the Germans knew they were doing some of this because they found one of them, but on June seventh, 19, 17 when he decides he's going to take this high ground, he starts off his attack by blowing up that eight miles of ridge lines with these munitions. There's more than a million pounds of explosives underneath those hills and when they blow up all within 28 seconds of each other, supposedly you could hear it in London. I've heard some people say it was heard in Ireland. It's thought to be the biggest manmade explosion before nuclear weapons or atomic weapons, and it vaporizes 10,000 Germans. Instantly.

Speaker 3:          03:58:30       The second those minds are blown up. Thousands of British artillery pieces on the horizon open fire on this same line of ridges and the British, 80,000 of them who come out of their trenches and and march toward that high ground have a pretty darn easy time taking it by first world war standards. I've got to always throw that in because to the naked eye it's still looks like a lot of people died, but by first world war standards, that's a pretty darn good attack and once again it seems to show that the British have found the secret sauce, the magic formula of how the tanks and the artillery, the aircraft, and it all works together perfectly and boom. Messina Ridge taken for not that much loss of life. Seems like, Hey, he knows what he's doing, but before he gets approval for this battle, it Breena.

Speaker 3:          03:59:15       He's pulling up the guns. He's getting ready. Lloyd George and company take him into a back room and make him kind of do a powerpoint presentation for Britain. Civilian leaders in Hague's sort of grits his teeth and does it and explains why it'll be a good thing and you know why, why we should be doing this and why it should be a walk over. Did you see that wonderful battle we just fought and took Messina Ridge. Haig will end up getting other generals and admirals to sort of side with him against the political leadership. There were always politicians who sided with the military and thought they're the professionals. You leave things to them. For guys like Churchill or Lloyd George, who were the ones questioning military leadership. They were in a very tough position. Can you imagine what risk they would have run if they had overruled all their military professionals and then 200,000 guys get killed in a battle, which by the way is almost the default result of a lot of these battles. So you could pretty much be assured that that would happen if it happened to the generals. Oh, well it just happened again to the generals. But if Lloyd George overruled all their generals and it happened because of him, you be sure he

Speaker 1:          04:00:20       would have been roasted. Um,

Speaker 1:          04:00:23       so predictably I'm Douglas Haig gets his offensive. He starts by starting a military bombardment of the area right around July 15th, July 20th, before the ground attack starts. The British will shoot almost 4 million shells to just show you how the progression is going. A year ago at the somme, we were all saucer. I'd and so was the rest of the world at the time when the British shot off a million shells before they started that battle for this, when they're shooting off almost 4 million. You can see why Germany is concerned with finding a way to turn their entire country into a munitions factory. As we said, was the goal on July 30, first 1917. The IPA offensive starts very soon afterwards, so does the rain. It will be the rain that will give this battle. It's unique standout character

Speaker 1:          04:01:23       and there are so many battles in the first world war that sound the same, that only a few stand out and it's always for some particular reason. It become associated with something special. You know, in a horrific way the most casualties are the most shells or the most this or that. I mean everyone knows Verdun is the great artillery meat grinder. Offensive. The Somme is that horrible, tragic situation with maybe tragic and competence that Bruce will off offensive in the east is known for its scope. Passion Dale, which will be the British name for third. Ipa, is known for its mud

Speaker 1:          04:01:55       and mud. Doesn't sound like too terrible a thing, but when you think about living outdoors and fighting mud makes a terrible situation worse, and I don't want to suggest that just because this is probably the worst mud anyone has ever fought in in the first world war. That mud has not been a problem for soldiers on other fronts and another battles. It's been sort of the bane of the existence for people especially in trenches, but nowhere is the mod like it is in flanders. The soldiers fighting in it described it as having a consistency of porridge or cheesecake. There is no bottom to it and you sink in it slowly as you would in quicksand. There are a lot of people who died in the first two battles of by drowning. In addition, there is a complex, very fragile system of dikes and other water and flood control measures that have been implemented in that area over the centuries to keep the water from taking it over. The artillery has done great damage to that before third iep right now with this wonderful barrage of 4 million shells that the British have have launched into this area. They've destroyed whatever was left at that system,

Speaker 1:          04:03:07       but it's when the rain starts that it gets horrifying because you take an already horrifying first world war western front battlefield of the sort we've described with the giant trenches everywhere. The vegetation

Speaker 3:          04:03:18       all gone except for the little twigs and sticks that used to be giant trees. This horrific hell more door like you know, landscape and you flood it. Now we've had battles like the psalm where there will be rain and you will have moments of flooding, but it isn't like this. This battlefield will start to flood and it will stay that way. There will only be three dry days in the month of August. In fact, they get double the normal rainfall and this turns the area into a swamp,

Speaker 3:          04:03:49       a swamp of quicksand, and very quickly with all of the, you know, casualties that start cropping up. You get the same kind of situation we talked about at the somme where the shell holes which are everywhere filled with water become like toxic dumps with human body's decaying in them and the remnants of poison gas and trash and the results of them using these things as latrines. I mean it is the most sickening stuff you can think of. As a matter of fact, one of the problems confronting the British at this battle is they don't have water for the troops. They have water everywhere. They have water coming out their ears, but none to drink and these shallow holes and the mud will form as nasty and enemy to the soldiers fighting in this as their know opposition and I don't want to suggest it wasn't bad for the Germans either. That may be the overlooked side of Passchendaele. It's so horrible and this is seared into British consciousness. Then it's so horrible for British troops, which let's remember, and not just English folks, they're Welsh Scotch, Irish, Newfoundland, Indian, Australian, New Zealand, Canadian, and I'm leaving some out there. All their suffering, but the Germans are suffering too.

Speaker 3:          04:05:00       The rain is so bad that within just a few days, Haig has to call a halt to operations. The guns are sinking. You know the horses are sinking up to their chest. The people are sinking. What makes this battle particularly horrifying is that in no other battle in the first world war, do you routinely see the soldiers put in that unbelievable situation that we quoted, norman cousins, that Scottish soldier, you know as saying he was given the tools to kill his fellow man if they were badly wounded on the battlefield. What if they're slowly sinking in mud? Because that's what was happening. When we talk about battles that scar nations, what do we mean by that? Well, in the first world war, hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of men would go through these terrible places. Passion, Dale's one, you know, Verdun was another. The Psalm was another. The Bruce and love offensive. I mean these people who go through these horrible experiences, number in the hundreds of thousands or millions. Those survivors then go home, permanently changed. How many human beings have to go home permanently changed for that to ripple across their entire societies? Passchendaele did just that, and part of the reason why was because what these people saw just destroyed them.

Speaker 3:          04:06:16       I mean the most widely in a lampooned poetic line is wildly lampoon because it became so associated with this battle and siegfried sassoon road, I died in hell. They called it passion Dale.

Speaker 3:          04:06:30       You can see pictures by the way of this battle on the battlefield to try to keep soldiers from getting stuck in the mud. They laid down duck boards and so you have and you have to imagine, go look at pictures. It is amazing. You have a battlefield that looks like the moon. If the moon had been turned to mud and then on the mud to try to keep people from sinking into it as though it's quick sand. They put these little teeny planks in and and they and they make them look like paths you know for, for where people need to go. But what this does is it means that the soldiers have to actually walk on those and machine gunners can just target them, and these duck boards are blown up every night by the artillery. And every night the royal engineers come and rebuild them for the next day under fire.

Speaker 3:          04:07:15       Peter Hart, in his wonderful book on the First World War, the Great War, quotes private Norman Cliff, a British soldier in the first grand dear guards describing you know what was happening, and it happened to thousands of soldiers, quote the approach to the Ridge was a desolate swamp over which brew did an eval menacing atmosphere that seemed to defy encroachment far more treacherous than the visible surface defenses with which we were familiar, such as barbed wire, deep devouring mud spread, deadly traps in all directions. We splashed and slithered and dragged our feet from the pull of an invisible enemy, determined to suck us into its depths. Every few steps someone would slide and stumble and weighed down by rifle and equipment rapidly sink into the squelching mess. Those nearest grabbed his arms, struggled against being themselves engulfed and if humanly possible dragged him out. When helpers floundered in as well and doubled the task, it became hopeless.

Speaker 3:          04:08:12       All the straining efforts failed and the swamps swallowed. It's screaming victims, and we had to be ordered to Plod on dejectedly and fight. This relentless enemy has stubbornly. As we did those we could see it happened that one of those leading us was Lieutenant Chamberlain and so distracted. He become at the spectacle of men drowning in mud and the desperate attempts to rescue them, that suddenly he began hysterically belaboring the shoulders of a singing man with his swagger stick. We were horror struck to see this most compassionate officer, so unstrung as to resort to brutality and are loud. Protests forced him to desist. The man was rescued, but some could not be, and they sank. Shrieking with fear and agony to be ordered. To Go ahead and leave a comrade to such a fate was the hardest experience. One could be asked to endure, but the objective had to be reached and we plunged on bitter anger against the evil forces prevailing piled onto our exasperations. This was as near to hell as I ever want to be and to quote, and Brian Cooper's

Speaker 4:          04:09:14       the ironclads of Cumbrae. He quotes a soldier at IPR saying, quote, one of our men was unfortunate enough to step out of line and fell into one of these mud holes. We managed to loop a rope securely under his armpits, but it was useless. The poor fellow now knew he was beyond all aid and begged me to shoot him rather than leave him to die. A miserable death by suffocation. I am not afraid to say therefore that I shot this man at his own urgent request.

Speaker 3:          04:09:42       End Quote. In the accounts, it's clear that this particular mode of dying affected the soldiers you know worse than most of the other ones. This is the true extra horror of Passchendaele of 30 [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          04:09:58       writer Adam Hochschild in his book to end all wars, quotes of British major at Third Ybarra who says, quote, a party of a company, men passing up to the front line found a man bogged to above the knees, bogged with mud. He means he says, quote, the united efforts of four of them with rifles beneath his armpits, made not the slightest impression, and to dig even if shovels had been available would be impossible for there was no foothold. Duty compelled them to move on up to the line and when two days later they passed down that way the wretched fellow was still there, but only his head was now visible and he was raving mad and to quote, and just like most of the other bad world war one battles, you know the people stuck out in no man's land that you couldn't go get drove the men in the trenches. They're comrades. Just almost insane with powerlessness. Historian John Keegan quotes British soldier Edwin Vaughn, who was at the third IPA and who describes how the rain takes a known horrific situation. The people stuck in no man's land and the suffering that they went through and the suffering that they then transmitted to their powerless comrades in the trenches and made it worse by just adding water.

Speaker 3:          04:11:20       Soldier von talks about being in a shell hole and then says, quote

Speaker 3:          04:11:26       from other shell holes from the darkness on all sides came, the groans and whales of wounded men faint long sobbing, moans of agony and despairing shrieks. It was too horribly obvious that dozens of men with serious wounds must've crawled for safety into new shell holes and now the water was rising about them and powerless to move. They were slowly drowning. Horrible visions came to me with those cries of men lying, maimed out there, trusting that their pals would find them and now dying terribly alone amongst the dead and the inky darkness and we could do nothing to help them. Dunham was crying quietly beside me and all the men were affected by the prettiest cries. And the quote, Lieutenant Edwin Vaughn and men are relieved a couple hours later. And as they're walking back down the line, he noticed his quote, the cries of the wounded had been much diminished now, and as we staggered down the road, the reason was only two apparent for the water was right over the tops of the shell holes and quote. Now, if you want it to look at this battle which went on for months in military terms and you wanted to look at it positively as some modern historians do, you could say that it killed between 220 and 350,000 more Germans. Nothing wrong with that. In a war of attrition right course, if you're the British political command, you will. You'll note that it killed about the same number of British soldiers.

Speaker 3:          04:12:56       It gained a few miles in some places. The Canadians heroically captured the town of Passchendaele against all odds and through much suffering and persevering. But again, it's not quite apparent how this really pushed the end of the war any closer.

Speaker 3:          04:13:15       It definitely pushed a lot of soldiers though, closer to a transformation that they would eventually, if they lived to make it home transfer to their entire society. British soldier, Ronald Skirt was for ever transformed by his experiences in flanders in 1917, as were so many others. It crushed the underpinnings of so much of his worldview. He writes about the battle quote. I said, the men's morale was breaking. I suppose I should have included myself. I had long since lost any desire to continue as a fighting soldier. Idealists and cowards aren't of much use on a battlefield, and I was a bit of both. At 19, I found my standards of conduct obsolete. My ideal shattered. I had lost all faith in institutional religion. My church had authorized me to break the sixth commandment in the name of patriotism and quote

Speaker 3:          04:14:10       he continues quote. Eventually I worked at all out. At least for myself. God was all right. It was we who were wrong. Why the hell should he care what happened to us a lot? We had brought this war evil into existence, not God. The reason evil and ugliness were triumphing over goodness and beauty. Why? Pity and compassion. We're considered weaknesses and ruthlessness and cruelty regarded as noble. The reason for all this was the wickedness in ourselves and not the indifference of God. That's why the more murders you committed, the bigger the hero you became. That's what made your superior officers slap you on the back and say, splendid old chap, jolly good shooting when your shells had destroyed in minutes, the beauty which craftsman had toiled lifetimes to create disillusion is very, very bitter. When you're young, thoughtful, imaginative, and sensitive and quote

Speaker 3:          04:15:03       in the postscript to his memoirs, writing in the third person skirts, quote before 19, 17 ended this unbelieved. You're insensitive. Youth had escaped death by inches a dozen times, had seen his comrades die in dreadful agony. Had seen and heard man, who should have been dead. Men broken, torn limbless, disemboweled screaming for anyone with a loaded rifle to end. They're unbearable. Sufferings and watched his friends and others slowly choke and froth is poison. Gas suffocated them could not believe it possible until his own eyes. Told him it was that half a man could live for what seemed to him hours and by the time he was rendered unconscious himself had come to realize that every friend he'd made, every man he'd worked with had become cannon fodder for years afterwards. Memories of these horrors haunted his dreams and disturbed his sleep, yet awake. He could never bring himself to talk to them and when he thought of those wounded men and the comrades he'd been with when they were killed, he always came to the same conclusion. It must never happen again. Never and to quote, there were hundreds of thousands of survivors like this young man, and they went home and greatly influenced their home societies. I mean, there are literary historians that will point to the influence these people had in the writings of the 19 twenties and 19 thirties everywhere.

Speaker 3:          04:16:41       War Artists, Paul Nash, was another one permanently affected by Passchendaele. He'd been to other areas and thought the war quite nice, and then went to passchendaele and had his entire world turned upside down. This is as related by David Reynolds in his fine history, the long shadow. He starts off by saying that Nash enjoyed all these other areas of the war and then writes quote, but when Nash returned in November to the rain and mode of passion, Dale, he was transfixed by quote the most frightful nightmare of a country more conceived by Dante or po. Then by nature, with no glimmer of God's hand to be seen anywhere. Sunrise and sunset or blasphemies Reynolds says he exclaimed, quote, they are mockeries to man and quote. Reynolds writes that the scene he says was gilded with the colors of hell, yellow stinking mud shell holes filled with green whitewater, black dying trees and unceasing shells that churned up the land into a graveyard. Quote coding nationality. I am no longer in artists interested in curious. I am a messenger who will bring back word from the men who are fighting to those who want the war to go on forever. Feeble, inarticulate will be my message, but it will have a bitter truth and may have burned their lousy souls. And quote

Speaker 1:          04:18:06       British war correspondent, Philip Gibbs was there, has been. If I keep us all over that battlefield and he had a true admiration for not just the English troops but all the dominion troops to and what they accomplished, their sort of a doomed heroism and gibbs was just blown away by what human beings in these gallon soldiers were able to achieve and nothing upset him more than to hear later that Sir Douglas Haig. The British commander had proclaimed reports of the battlefield at Passchendaele as being exaggerated. This is how a very angry gibbs responded. Quote Sir Douglas Haig thinks that some of the descriptions of that six months horror where quote end quote exaggerated as a man who knows something of the value of words and who saw many of those battles scenes in flanders and went out from her many times during those months and then he names all the places that he'd been and ends up by saying and beyond to polygon wood and Passion Dale, where his dad lay meaning the dead. That Haig was responsible for where his dead lay in the swamps and round the pillboxes and were tanks that are wallowed into the mire were shot into scrap. Iron by German gunfire and where our own guns were being flung up by the harassing fire of heavy shells. I say now that nothing that has been written is more than a pale image of the abomination of those battlefields and that no pen or brush has yet achieved the picture of that Armageddon in which so many of our men perished and quote,

Speaker 1:          04:19:38       many people began to doubt British military leadership just because they would think you should ever fighting conditions that were that bad. There's a story and some people doubted, ever happened. It used to be something that was mentioned by almost everyone writing about passion Dale. In his book in Flanders Fields. Leon Wolf tells the story his way and says the following day, Lieutenant General Sir Lancelot Cagle paid his first visit to the fighting zone as a staff car lurched through the swamp land and near the battleground, he became more and more agitated. Finally, he burst into tears and muttered good God. Did we really send men to fight in that the man beside him who had been through the campaign replied tone. Leslie gets worse further on up and to quote some say, it would be ridiculous to think that these military folks had not been out to the field and seeing the conditions are known what they were like. I'm not going to take a position on that. All I will suggest is that there were a lot of people who looked at the conditions of passion Dale and wondered, you know, what was going on in the heads of Britain's military leaders.

Speaker 1:          04:20:46       Passchendaele is one of the most often cited nightmares of this war to Britain's along with the song and just like the psalm, it did terrible damage to Britain's army,

Speaker 1:          04:21:00       British military historian John Keegan, who is definitely in the Anti Haig camp, wrote quote on the Psalm. He had sent the flower of British youth to death or mutilation at passchendaele. He had tipped the survivors into the slew of despond and quote for those in Britain's political class that wished the generals would pay more attention to casualties. They would get their wish, but not for an entire generation. The junior officers at places like passchendaele would be permanently affected by that battle. British military writer Brigadier Peter Young wrote, quote, the memory of this battle affected British leadership in the Second World War, causing many commanders to go to extremes to try to avoid casualties and quote, this attitude will come a generation too late for leaders like Lloyd George, he and his allies had tried to call off the passchendaele campaign after the first sort of impetus was spent only to fail once again up against the military leadership and was heard to say blood and mud, bloods and mod. They can think of nothing better, but it should be said, even though the British are suffering, these kinds of casualties, so are the Germans and their soldiers are being as tragically affected by this fighting as the British soldiers.

Speaker 1:          04:22:34       The German general Hermann von Cool wrote in his report about the troops fighting in flanders quote, the sufferings, privation, and exertions, which the soldiers had to bear were indescribable. Terrible, was the spiritual burden on the lonely man in a shell hole or trench and terrible. The strain on the nerves during the British bombardment, which continued day and night, the hell of Verdun and the Somme was exceeded by flanders, the battle, the whole flanders has been the greatest martyrdom of the war, and looking back, it seems that what was born here was superhuman, but perhaps it may still prove to be too great. A courageous sacrifice and to quote, well, what general cool didn't know December 1917 was that something was taking root that would end up leading to the German military commanders getting their hands on between 500,000 and a million fresh veteran rested soldiers. Fate is about to put the dice, the iron dice back into the hands of Germany's leadership. It's well known. They are already inveterate gamblers and the chance to try to throw a knockout punch in a war where both sides like badly beat up and permanently damaged fighters will be irresistible.

Speaker 1:          04:24:09       Seems like no matter what Lloyd George does, there's more blood and mud and the world's future. In 1918.

Speaker 1:          04:24:45       I'd like to apologize for a couple of things right off the bat. The first thing is for silly little persnickety mistakes

Speaker 1:          04:24:54       you can probably tell, especially if you wait for these programs to be released as we make them, that I'm a bit of a nut when it comes to detail and yet the people around me keep telling me that there's a certain failure rate that should be expected. I'm not really good at accepting that, especially when I catch the errors before the show gets out. Nonetheless, this one will go out with me saying the word trenches to describe the kinds of fortifications that the British Orien at passchendaele and of course shell holes would be a much closer term. I think trenches to those British soldiers would have been a luxury on that battlefield. Nonetheless, those are the pedal. The little things that slipped through our strainer here, even when we catch them so that these shows come out more than once a year, which we are just barely beating that I think right now, heading toward once a year if this pace keeps up. So I apologize for the piddly little errors in the past. The ones in this show, any in the future. Um, we try hard but we're not perfect. The other thing I'd like to apologize for his, for perhaps ignoring your favorite part of this story, whatever that might be. A favorite region, a favorite army, a favorite people or favorite event.

Speaker 1:          04:26:07       Picking a topic like this is humbling and you know, once again shows you some of the potential downsides with our leap before we look topic picking policy here on the program. Um, nonetheless, I will forgive in advance from now on. I promise I've learned my lesson, every historian and author who talks too much about the western front at the expense of other areas of the first world war because you start to realize why that becomes important. This is a very confusing story. There's a lot going on. It would be so easy to go off in the weeds and lose everybody. I half the time worry about losing myself in the story. You end up sticking to the western front and Russia and the United States as a sort of an anchor to keep the story, you know, clinging to some sort of structure. In some ways I think it's probably the week hosts answer to the problem.

Speaker 1:          04:26:58       On the other hand, every time you introduce theater and another people and another in a region and more names and individuals, you make the story more and more confusing. The first world war is a giant topic. What you're getting here, and I say this about all of our productions, don't I? You're getting the Dan Carlin version of the first world war and unfortunately that's leaving a lot of things out, but I tell you what, as a friend of mine once said, perhaps we should look at it as just leaving a lot more potential future hardcore history topics available for us to handle down the road. In the next show, we're going to make up some of the deficit for the things we haven't talked about and make up for some lost time in the Middle East. There are many things going on that create, you know, the, the, the beginnings of the modern world in that region, including important foundational events that lay the groundwork for the modern recreation of the ancient state of Israel in that region in Russia.

Speaker 1:          04:28:03       We get to see what an intellectual contagion that might be a good way to describe it, dropped down into the middle of the very fertile petri dish that is provisional government, Russia can do to a country like that in an answer to the question will perhaps arise as to whether or not an army can actually function if the soldiers get to vote on whether they want to follow orders or not. And finally, we'll get to see the arrival of US troops in large numbers on the European continent. For the first time ever, if I'm lucky and get what I want, we will get to delve a little bit into air power and how it's three dimensionalizing battlefields and how that technological race is a little like, you know, Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and those guys were involved in technology back in 1969, 1917. They might very well be in airplane development geeks.

Speaker 1:          04:29:03       These pilots in these planes are, you know, half Technological Geek and half Medieval Knight. We'll talk a bit about that if I get lucky and I can make the time. And finally we'll talk certainly about the difference when both sides are exhausted on the western front, that half a million to a million fresh troops can make, and I'm not talking about American troops, I'm talking about the German soldiers that arrive from the eastern front to the western front can make on tired French and British armies before the Americans arrive in enough numbers to make a difference. The last year of the war is full of surprises. All that and more on part six of blueprint for Armageddon.
