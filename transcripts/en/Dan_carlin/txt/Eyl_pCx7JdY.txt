Speaker 1:          00:00:00       What you're about to hear is part three of a multipart series on the first world war. If you're one of those individual that likes to know the story before the story, you might want to catch up on those if you missed either one of them, although some of you probably don't mind just being dropped into the middle of a story like you arrived in the time machine and you have to figure things out. If you're one of those kind of individuals, you know who cares about those earlier two shows, why don't you just jump on in and joining the horror in progress with blueprint for Armageddon, part three,

Speaker 2:          00:00:31       some bus seven, 19, 41 date which will live in infamy.

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       Each one, the events

Speaker 3:          00:00:53       that dude,

Speaker 4:          00:00:57       the figure is going to the lead on this time and place. I take pride in the words the Alina tear down.

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       Wow.

Speaker 3:          00:01:20       Complete.

Speaker 4:          00:01:24       Hi, welcome. This kind of examination because people have got to know whether or not their question, well, I'm not a crop. If we dig deep in our district and our doctors and remember we are not descended from fearful. Man.

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       It's hardcore history. The very same week that the first world war breaks out, August 19, 14, a British expedition leaves British waters and heads for the South Pole. Antarctica led by a guy named Ernest Shackleton. Shackleton is one of the people that's normally associated with the very tail end of what's called the age of discovery, the age of exploration, and you know what's the tail end? Because you know, unlike guys like Christopher Columbus, Shackleton and his crew have cameras. Nineteen 14, you bring a camera with you and he's able to document in photographs. Real clear, interesting photographs. This ordeal that he's about to experience as he's on his way to Antarctica, he's keeping tabs on this war that's broken out right when he left. I mean this is the first real period of globalization and the world and he can keep track via telegraph of the sort of major events that are going on

Speaker 1:          00:02:46       and like everyone. Shackleton is appalled by the scale. You can't believe the amount of casualties, the number of people, the challenges involved in logistics. It feels like this flame that is burning at an unbelievable intensity. So everybody just assumed that couldn't continue very long. That had been the assumption even before the war broke out. The Kaiser famously says to his departing troops, you'll be home before the leaves fall. When the French military leader Joseph offer is told that his troops should be issued metal helmets to replace those cloth hats that they're starting the war with. He says, don't bother. They'll never reach the troops before the war is over. So there's this real feeling that something that's operating at that level of intensity can't continue for very long before shackleton gets to find out how the whole thing ends, though he in his ship and his crew get trapped in the ice in the Antarctic and again, photos exist.

Speaker 1:          00:03:39       It's wonderful. You get to watch the ship as it's crushed by the ice and shackleton and the crew have to get out and basically live on the ice flows while they wait to be rescued, which is not happening fast enough. And he can see that his people are going to die out there. If somebody doesn't do the really brave thing and take one of the little boats. You know, the 20, 25 footers off the big boat amounting to almost an open rowboat, not quite, but almost, and he and a few crew members get in it and head out into the Arctic waters looking for land. It's insane when you think about it and it's insane that he survived and in May 19, 16, he and these couple of guys that he set out, you know, into the Arctic with, I mean with amazing stories of of towering waves and all these things stumbled into an isolated whaling station on south Georgia island, which normally most of us would think as penguin territory.

Speaker 1:          00:04:36       It must've seemed positively Balmy to shackleton and his crew, who by this time looked like bigfoot or something like a missing link. Totally sunburned. The beards on their faces, frozen and icicles hanging off them. They were originally wearing animal skins, but those skins did not like the salt water very much and had melted and were rotting and smelled and were falling off of them. I mean, the first thing they do when they get to this whaling stations scare the heck out of two boys. A couple of 12 year olds or something, see them first and go off running and who could blame him? Eventually though the adults come running, shackleton identifies himself. He's taken in to be sort of restored, given water and I guess you could say debriefed and we're told that one of the first questions he asks, his benefactor is for an update on whatever happened with the war he was following and he says, tell me when was the war over and in one of the more famous responses you'll ever get about this, because it says so much in a couple of sentences and that's why it's gone down in history. The benefactor as opposed to have answered is when was the war over question with the war isn't over millions or dead. Europe is mad. The world is mad.

Speaker 1:          00:05:54       If Shackleton reacts to this news with horrified, disbelief,

Speaker 5:          00:05:59       then he's just catching up to the rest of the world because no one can believe that the level of intensity that this conflict displays from minute one can be sustained. Remember, this war starts very differently than the second world war does. The Second World War kind of ramps up slowly. The first world war is like someone pulling the pin on a grenade and everything explodes at once. Everyone attacks at once. There are a lot more people killed in the first month of the first world war. Then the first month of the second, in fact, so many people are killed that the people living through this period have nothing to compare this to. The numbers are off the charts. I mean look at what they were looking at as normal casualty numbers and by the way, this is considered to be horrible. So I mean they. They thought it could be bad.

Speaker 5:          00:06:47       It could be like the Russo, Japanese war on steroids could knit. That war happened the decade before. The first world war lasted. Eighteen months is seen as sort of the testing ground for a lot of the weapons and tactics and everything that would be used in the next war. And in 18 months a hundred and 65,000 people are killed. It's horrible. One hundred and 65,000 people are killed in a week or two when the first world war breaks out. Twenty 2000 Frenchmen die in a day in August, 1914. There are no metrics for that for you. American history fans out there. What's the worst war in American history? The US civil war, right? Because everyone who dies is an American casualty. Last four years, you lose between 600,000 and 700,000 Americans killed. That's how many people you lose killed roughly in the first month of the first world war. Everyone is stunned and it's not just gender roles and world leaders and everything.

Speaker 5:          00:07:48       Let's say that this war can't last. You have some of the top economic minds in the world saying that for economic reasons, it can't continue. John Maynard Keynes, the guy who will later be the father of Keynesian economics says in 1914 that the war won't last a year. As soon as the financial liquidity dries up, he says, all the belligerents will be forced to come to terms and make peace. He couldn't have been more wrong. Countries will ditch the gold standard almost immediately. They'll inflate their currency, they'll open up lines of credit and they'll start borrowing. It was lord her ratio, kitchener Britain's war minister, and one of the few people who understood how long this war was really going to. Last said, quote, no financial pressure has ever stopped a war in progress and kitchen or understood what many of these people who should have understood better didn't, and that's that we had entered the era where nation states could really take a punch. We talked about that in an earlier episode. It's a mixed blessing. It means that you don't succumb to the enemy's attacks right away, but it means you also last longer and when you last longer, you see your human and your financial capital ground into powder. There are a lot of people who wonder whether it was actually a benefit for the French and the British to win the battle of the Marne.

Speaker 5:          00:09:11       That's where we left off the last program. The Battle of the Marne at the time was seen as know the savior of France. The Germans would their prewar battle plans with they're meticulous precision planning that had had decades to come up with perfecting this plan. They'd failed at the battle of the Marne when, when by the time you know the, the, the crowning moment happens where everything rests on what the Germans are doing. Both sides are like a couple of punch drunk prize fighters. We've been using that analogy for this whole conflict because it worked so well and up until you know the French and British victory at the Marne. The Germans had been the one really dishing out the heavy blows, but everyone is so tired and at the end of their rope, by the time the Maren happens only a month into the conflict that you get the feeling like it's the end of the first round of that both fighters have given everything they have and they're so tired that if anybody could just land one solid blow on either side, it'll be over on the French and the British land that blow and the Germans are forced backward.

Speaker 5:          00:10:17       They're forced backward so that they can reorganize their lines and close up this dangerous hole in their lines that was exploited by French and British troops, as Churchill famously said, as only he can. Those troops were probing their way into the German liver and it's a classic maneuver to try to pull your troops back and reorganize your lines, but it's also a dangerous one and it also means that the Germans have given up on the so called Schlieffen plan.

Speaker 5:          00:10:51       Can I find it interesting? Sometimes when you read some of the histories of the first world war, you will find yourself in a very similar situation to the commanders on both sides of the western. What will become the western front and that is you will be studying this as though you're playing around with toy soldiers. I mean, I'll read stuff where they'll say, you know, this division did this and pulled back to here and you're totally losing track of the human element. And the problem with that is if you don't understand the condition of the people on the ground, you're going to create all sorts of plans that don't take into account what they can actually carry out. I mean, for example, the general staffs have all these armies are tens of miles behind where the fighting is. I mean, most of them, the German general staff for example, are sitting in wonderful French chateaus with roaring fire places, drinking wine out of crystal glasses and playing with maps and protractors trying to decide where to move people and what to do with them. And the British and the French commanders are often doing the same thing. The problem is is that these little protractors in these armies that they're moving around on maps bear no resemblance to what the human beings on the ground or dealing with. The human beings on the ground are spent.

Speaker 5:          00:12:14       Both sides have warned themselves down to the nub and can hardly function anymore. I mean, this is the point in the war. Once the Germans start retreating after the battle of the Marne, where the British and French commanders think they've got them on the run, Sir John French, the British commander thinks that he's going to be in Berlin in six weeks. It's going to be over. We'll unleash the cavalry will launch this massive pursuit, will destroy the enemy who's routing and it'll be all over. The problem is as Sir John French's troops are in no condition to do that. In fact, every side is finding out another one of the new realities of modern warfare and that's that they use ammunition at a pace that nobody was prepared for. At this point in the conflict, everybody is actually rationing the artillery. They can't even use the guns the way they want to because they don't have enough shells. I mean, take the Russians as a perfect example. At this point in the war, the Russians are producing 35,000 artillery shells a month. Sounds great, doesn't it? Until you realize that once the fighting actually starts, they're using 45,000 shells a day,

Speaker 5:          00:13:28       making $35,000 a month, shooting off 45,000 shells a day. Now all these armies went into the conflict with nice reserves of these shells, but by a month and a half into it, they are down to almost nothing and even the French and the British, you know, as they pursued the German armies, as the German army's retreat from the modern, they can't function the way that they're trained and ready to do so. They have to ration everything and so did the Germans and everybody's just at the end of their rope and you lose the human element. When you study the history of things from the very highest levels in the moving of armies around on maps and you see arrows and cavalry armies and all these kinds of things. When the people on the ground or in a completely different situation. Here's how writer Gj Meyer describes the situation after them on quote the French and British.

Speaker 5:          00:14:19       Though jubilant at and in many cases astonished by the German withdrawal from the Marne were badly battered, worn out, and running low on essential equipment. Many were almost too exhausted to move. He's quoting an English soldier now quote, after five days and nights of fighting, one English soldier wrote, decimated, spent and hungry. We are lying on the bare earth with only one desire in our hearts to get ourselves killed. Meyer continues and they were short of shells for their artillery. It is one measure of the intensity of this new kind of warfare that the French faced critical shortages of ammunition for their 75 millimeter canon. They're most effective field artillery piece because only 10,000 rounds were being produced per day. That was barely 20 percent of the need. He continues for any number of such reasons. The armies of the entente, the allies failed to close with the retreating Germans or exploit the huge gap that had prompted their withdrawal.

Speaker 5:          00:15:17       They did not attack in force until the German first, second, and third armies had settled into fortified positions on high ground north of the Ain, the next east, West River, north of the Marne. By then it was too late and to quote the Germans themselves were in a horrible condition. German soldier, Julius Koch, and writes about the retreat from the Marne quote. The streets were badly worn, abandoned vehicles. We're aligned on the sides of the road. We began to move at 3:00 in the morning and before we were fully aware of what was happening, we found ourselves with the rear guard. Regiments of infantry shot to pieces arrived in a pitiful condition. They had cast away their knapsacks and all unnecessary impediments and we're trying to get along as fast as possible. Soon after the first shrapnel of the enemy began to burst above our heads, which caused us to accelerate our march continually.

Speaker 5:          00:16:09       The road which had also been used during the advance, was still marked by deep shell holes that were filled with water to the very edge for it rained without interruption. It was pitch dark and every now and then someone would fall into one of those shell holes we were all wet through, but continue to press on. Some would stumble over something in the dark, but nobody paid any attention. The great thing was to get along dead horses and men lay in the middle of the road, but nobody took the trouble to remove the obstacle into quote, lest we forget about the human element. Remember that these Germans are moving through country that was formally occupied by civilians. Where the heck are they? Well, in a lot of cases they're still there and in very great danger. Here's what coach and writes about that quote. The road was covered with the equipment the soldiers had thrown away.

Speaker 5:          00:17:03       We too had long ago cast aside all unnecessary ballast. Thus we were marching when we passed a wood densely packed with refugees. Those hunted people had stretched blankets between the trees so as to protect themselves from the rain. They are. They were lying in the greatest conceivable misery all in the jumble men and women, children and gray beards. They're camp reached as far as the road and one could observe the terrible hours that they'd lived through, had left deep furrows in their faces. They looked at us with we're retired eyes. The children begged us to give them some bread, but we had nothing whatsoever left and we're ourselves tormented by hunger. The enemy's shrapnel was still accompanying us and we had scarcely left the wood when shrapnel began to explode, which caused the refugees now exposed to the fire to crowd into the fields in an attempt to reach safety. Many of them joined us, but before long they were forbidden to use the road because they impeded the retreat of the troops. Thus all of them were driven without pity into the fields soaked by the rain end quote. As German soldiers like Julius or Yulia coaching are retreating back the way they came there being closely pursued by their French and British fab. The series one of whom is the Irish soldier fighting in the British Expeditionary Force that we've talked about earlier. John Lucy, who writes about this time quote,

Speaker 5:          00:18:30       our advanced continued steadily as the Germans were driven back from the Marne. Their rear guards showed some resistance every day and occasionally we picked up stragglers and wounded from the enemy army. Although we took our turn in our brigade at advanced garden outpost duties. Our battalion did not really cross swords with the enemy again until the 14th of September. On that day and on the few days proceeding it, rain fell and we were not very comfortable either. In bivouac are on the line of March. The weather began to get cold on the evening of 13th September, a British airplane, one of the few the British army possessed approached us from the German side and wheeling around a lighted in a field to the right of our marching columns. The flying officer climb slowly out of his machine and coming stumbling towards us in his heavy kit. Did Not wait to find an officer, but shouted to us all there. They are waiting for you up there. Thousands of them and he waived his right arm toward the wooded heights across the river ane some three miles away, and to quote the river Ain was right by the highest elevated point in this whole area of the front. Now it's not very high in terms of the grand scheme of geography around the planet, but in the very flat Harry in near the French and Belgian borders, it was 500 feet tall in some places and that gave a commanding view of all the flat country around it. This is the point that the German soldiers had been told to turn back around and face their pursuers and dig in and stopped them.

Speaker 5:          00:20:10       This had been one of the last command is made by the former German commander, the one whose job it was to carry out the Schlieffen plan. Helmut von Moltke, the younger before he totally collapsed from his nervous breakdown. After his plan failed, he's replaced by one of his critics a controversial choice that the kaiser tabbed a guy named General Eric from Falcon. Hi. Now, one thing that becomes clear when you look at the high commands have all these armies is the generals have outrageous most of the time and they often are jealous and they snipe at their peers and when Falcon hine is named, it angers among other people. Eric Luton door, this young wonder kin who's been doing great things for the Germans on the eastern front and who, who will say a Falcon Heinz appointment, I am only capable of love and hate, and I hate General Falcon Heine and Falcon. Haim was critical of von Moltke before the battle of the Marne even starts Falcon High and looks at what von Moltke is doing and thinks he's lost his mind and writes. On September fifth, 19, 14 quote, our general staff has completely lost its head. Sleeping's notes do not help any further and so his wits come to an end and to quote,

Speaker 5:          00:21:39       well, the Kaiser must've read that and decided that since von Moltke couldn't pull this off, maybe one of his critics can falcon hine turns his troops around, tells them to dig in and begins looking for replacements for the people who've died. Because the German army is a fraction of what it was just a couple of weeks before and they aren't the only ones. The British and the French armies have a similar problem. They're all decimated. The differences is Britain and France have colonies and dominions and Commonwealth nations who the minute the war starts are basically told to get people over there and there are arriving every day.

Speaker 5:          00:22:18       The British have Indian troops from India arrive and Canadian show up very quickly. The Scots from Scotland are always a part of the British forces and they arrive in kilts and this is where they will get their famous nickname, which some people wonder if it even happened this way, but it's too good of a nickname to not mention the German supposedly call them the ladies from Hell because of the kilts they were and they were all showing up every day in greater numbers and taking their place in the line to replace the dead and the wounded. The French are bringing troops from North Africa, from Morocco and Algeria and troops from central Africa and places like Senegal. So you have dark skinned black Africans. In the French army, something that the Germans one are not accustomed to and to a little dismayed about because they think about all of the black Africans left in Africa that may be could be brought to fight against them too.

Speaker 5:          00:23:16       When the Germans tried to reinforce their own, you know, torn open ranks, they have to do it with Germans. Now they have a bunch of them people who the minute the war was declared, signed up and joined the forces and we're in training this whole time. The problem is that the war is only about six weeks old. None of these people have had enough training to make them anywhere near as good as the soldiers they're trying to replace but fall could and calls them up. Anyway. The situation is desperate. The war could be lost right here, right now and every man is needed

Speaker 5:          00:23:49       and all these troops are going to be thrown into the blood bath up near the French and Belgian border. It's at that spot where the Germans had turned around, halted the retreat that had been going on ever since the battle of the Marne taken the heights on the other side of the river ane and begun to Deegan fortify, reequip reinforce and are waiting for their pursuers to show up. They're French and British pursuers assume that they're going after a bunch of Rowdy Germans. They're not expecting to run into heavily four to five positions in a very, very strong spot. Remember John Lucy and the BDF or marching toward that area. When that airplane lands in the field and the pilot goes running up to the British march column saying they're waiting for you. Thousands of them on the other side of the river on the night of September 13th, 1914, the French and the British tried to cross that river and dislodged the Germans from the height and it's a disaster.

Speaker 5:          00:24:48       The British do this crossing at night in heavy fog on pontoon boats for the most part. They get to the other side aside that has no natural cover and that's facing, you know, four to 500 foot hills in the distance, heavily wooded and the sun comes up and burns off the fog, leaving the British troops totally exposed and the Germans slaughter them. Artillery machine guns even from the flank, the British stagger back across the river and their commander Sir John French orders them to dig in and face the Germans who were dug in on the other side of the river.

Speaker 5:          00:25:26       This is the main thing. Your history books will tell you that the first battle of the ane is known for. It's supposedly the time when trench warfare is initiated. This will be the most iconic and memorable part of the first world war, but it's a misnomer to suggest that trench warfare just started here because given the technology of the day, trench warfare begins organically. It's a natural human response to the fact that the air above ground level is filled with so much steel and lead that it's suicide to be out in the open, so across the entire front, stretching all the way from the Swiss border across the entire Franco German border up through Luxembourg, up into Belgium. More than 400 miles and millions of men on both sides. Long human beings have done the most natural thing possible. They've gone to ground and they've tried to get as low as possible to escape what earns gender. We'll call the storm of steel. Later in the war, in addition to digging down, they throw up things called breast works, which is putting stuff in front of your position to stop the bullets from hitting you. If you're lucky, it's sandbags. If you're not lucky, it's anything you can get your hands on. The combination of digging in the earth and putting up barriers in front of you begins to fortify the entire line on both sides and in some spots. The Germans and the French are only a couple hundred yards from each other.

Speaker 5:          00:26:57       The fortification of the entire line changes this war in ways that the generals on either side are unprepared for. They don't know what to do,

Speaker 5:          00:27:07       so they go back to the training manuals which say find a flank, turn the flank attack in the rear. The problem is is that there's only one tiny little area of this more than 400 mile line where it hasn't calcified into a normal siege situation and that's the area between, you know, this battle at the river and that has just happened and the ocean to the north of it. It's not a very big zone and both the British and the French on one side and the Germans on the other begin a crab like dance of death as one historian described it, trying to probe their way towards open country for a very long time. This was known as the race to the sea, but historians have come to hate that term because it gives the false idea that somehow reaching the c is the goal of both these sides would. In fact, if both sides reached the sea, it means that there are no flanks anymore and there will be several big battles between the army's as they collide in their attempt to find an open flank to turn. Now, it's worth pointing out here that what we're about to experience is the most complicated war I've ever studied and it's a very unusual conflict because in many cases, the battlefield is not going to change. This area up near the Franco Belgian border, for example, is going to become one of the worst killing grounds, extended killing grounds in all human history, and later in the war, troops marching up to this battle ground will be able to smell it before they actually get there.

Speaker 5:          00:28:52       In addition, when one side attacks, the other side will often counter attack, so if you look at the battle on a map, it makes no sense at all. I've got 400 page books that deal with just single encounters between the two sides and it's impossible to make heads or tails of it even with maps, even if you're an expert. And part of the reason why is because the nature of battle has changed. Armies are staying in contact with each other now, and that's very different than through most of human history. Through most of human history. Armies come together, there's a short, sharp clash, and then they break contact and move in opposite directions. Again, battles that last more than one day are extremely rare. Up until this time period, all of a sudden, these armies aren't going to break contact. They're going to stay on opposite sides of a short little no man's land and hold each other by the throat even on so called quiet parts of the front.

Speaker 5:          00:29:49       Hundreds or thousands of men can be killed every day. Now, this is not unheard of near the end stages of the US civil war, ulysses s grant, the northern general, will have a similar strategy where he maintains contact with the enemy, grabs them by the throat, doesn't let them go and grind them down. A strategy of attrition, but that's new to the European experience and neither side's giving up yet they're going to try to find that flank until there is no flank anymore. That race to the sea will involve several more big battles including one that involves you know what's left of the poor Belgian army. Remember the Belgian army was what the Germans thought. We're going to be a bunch of chocolate soldiers and instead they put up this heroic doomed resistance to them. You know, fighting and being pushed backwards every step of the way. Once the Germans reform their lines at the river and their entire flank is threatened by the parts of Belgium that haven't fallen to them yet, including the giant and vital port city of Antwerp.

Speaker 5:          00:30:54       So this is when the Germans go take all that they pound and top with those same enormous guns that they destroyed the Belgian forts with at the beginning of the war and they pushed the Belgian army. All the ways too that the Belgians are sitting there with their backs to the ocean. There is no place left to run and the Belgian king is with them. And at one point he orders his officers to stand behind the trenches and shoot any Belgian soldiers that dare run away and they stay there being pounded by the artillery until they can't stop the Germans. They realized that if they don't hold that area, the Germans are going to be the one who find that open flank and the turn, the British and the French. And this is, you know, the part of the war where it looks like the Germans might actually reverse the entire battle of the Mons results and when any way.

Speaker 5:          00:31:43       So the Belgians do something that is, you know, their nuclear option and it's a, it's a sacrifice that might have saved the war for the allies. Remember, Belgium is one of those areas of Europe that is actually, for the most part, this part of flanders that we're talking about in Belgium below sea level. And the reason that it even exists is because you know, forever the Belgians have been pumping out water and building dikes and things like that to keep the ocean out the king of Belgium. When things become desperate to the point of doomsday blows up the dykes, the Belgian king makes the decision to let the seawater in on October 22nd, and it's a true sacrifice because he's not just flooding one of the more fertile parts of his country. He's flooding it with sea water and the salt water will do terrible damage to the fertility of the region. Remember, the Romans supposedly would so salt into the ground of the territory of their very worst enemies so that nothing would ever grow. There again, the Belgians had done this to themselves voluntarily to protect the very end of the allied line and keep the Germans from breaking through and perhaps taking the channel ports, which would have been a disaster.

Speaker 5:          00:33:00       The Germans have no idea what's going on as the water level rises, but within a couple of days there's a five mile wide shoulder deep lake separating them and the Belgian forces and the Belgians will stay behind that lake for years. That essentially shuts off that part of the front. The bad news for the other allied forces is that now that the Germans didn't need those troops to try to deal with the Belgians, they turn them around and threw them into the developing battle at a place called [inaudible], which on October, 22nd breaks out big time and eat crap becomes this point where the true futility of the wasting of lives is so aptly demonstrated because of course, war is all about spending lives to achieve a goal. The tragedy happens when you spend lives for no good reason and an eat pray. You begin to see the kinds of tragic levels that this will reach a large number of the troops that the Germans had called up. You know, with very little training or young people, students whose teachers had indoctrinated them into the idea that this is what you do when you fight for Germany and what a great honor it's going to be. You know, when they would all join up together as students with fraternity badges and all these things. And after very little training, they were thrown into this combat that was developing around the city of Ipa and the surrounding area

Speaker 5:          00:34:29       in one of the really tragic parts of the conflict, the students would run up against what was left of some of the greatest military units in the world, what was left of the old British professional army, which had been ground down. You know, ever since the war started, but still had some of its best units intact. These badly trained 16, 17 and 18 year old kids

Speaker 5:          00:35:01       would be massacred for no good reason. As author Winston Groom writes, quote on a front of nearly 20 miles, tens of thousands of men came to grips and did their best to murder each other in the cold, Dank, misty hill surrounding April. In many places, the fighting was hand to hand that morning, divisions of the German Fourth Army consisting in large part of students attack the British line, such as it was in a fit of Wagnerian frenzy. The German students came on arm in arm or waving their rifles in the air, singing and with their spiked pickle. How the helmets festooned with flowers by the thousands they were shot down even though they outnumbered the British at times six to one that morning. They faced the most professional and elite regiments of the British Army, if not the world, the Black Watch, coldstream guards', Scots Guards, Cameron's Grenadier Guards, Irish Guards, Stafford's, Gordon, highlanders, green, howards, royal, Scots, fusiliers, Welsh, fusiliers, and others almost too numerous to mention, including the [inaudible] and dragons of the Cavalry Corps when it was all over. The British official history estimated that at least half of these youthful teutonic warriors, 100,000 of them had been shot down. The Germans named the battle, the massacre of the innocence and quote in German it was the kinder Morgan and after the war, the parents of some of these children would put a poignant monument over there, mass grave showing a weeping father and mother looking out over the mass graves festooned with the fraternity pins of these young kids who thought war was going to be a romantic, heroic adventure.

Speaker 5:          00:36:58       I'm not going to focus on battle after battle after battle of pointless conflict in this story. It's a complicated and detailed enough conflict. Did you kind of have to pick your battles, if you'll pardon the pun, and it's the human side of this affair that I want to focus on what the people who were living through it, we're forced to experience.

Speaker 5:          00:37:24       For example, 20 year old Herbert Solves Bach, a gunner who had joined up as the war starts and it was getting his first taste of battle as the battle of eep or begins and he writes, quote, change of position. We pull forward, get our first glimpse of this battlefield and have to get used to the terrible scenes and impressions, corpses, corpses, and more corpses rubble and the remains of a captured village trenches hastily, Doug, by the British, are full of bodies. We get driven out of this position by infantry and artillery fire. We stand beside the guns with the horses and a dreadful night comes down on us. We've seen too many horrible things all at once. They make a very strong impression on us. Barely 20 years old as we are, but these things also hardened us up for what's going to come and to quote,

Speaker 5:          00:38:16       he's not the only one. The German writes to his sweetheart with care for her sensibilities and an understanding of what military censorship might do to his letter about what the reality of what he's experiencing is like, and he writes during these battles in Flanders, quote my dear Maria, I feel so terrible. I'd really rather not write to you. That doesn't mean I've forgotten you though. Every day spent here makes it clearer to me how beautiful home is and what a crowd of feelings that word home brings out in me. I've lived through such horror recently. No words can describe it. The tragedy all around me, every day the fighting gets fiercer and there is no end in sight. Our blood is flowing in torrance. When I think of our 247th regiment, my ice swim with tears. The first and second battalions have only 250 to 300 men left.

Speaker 5:          00:39:11       So more than half are gone today. Only a few of my comrades will be still standing. My company commander, Lieutenant Moss Power, had been at the front for one hour when he was shot through the head Pale and close to death. He was carried past me today. Sunday, I stood at this modest grave and joined in prayer. That's how it is all around me. The most gruesome devastation. Dead and wounded soldiers, dead and dying animals, horse cadavers, burned out, houses, dug up fields, cars, clothes, weaponry. All of this is scattered around me. A real mess. I didn't think war would be like this. We can't sleep for all the noise. At least 30 shells exploded once the whole time. We called for backup yesterday and today. I hope they make it. There are only a few of us left to tackle the English. I managed to wash myself properly yesterday for a change. My beard is getting ever longer. Otherwise I'm feeling fine. As you can see, all this noise is not going to ruffle my Wurtenburg calm and cool. That's from a German soldier named Paul Hub. This war brings out the extremes of humanity and even the most monstrous human beings that you can pick out throughout history, exhibit some of that humanity through their writing. If you go read one of the most monstrous human beings who's ever lived, chronicles of this combat, even he seemed somewhat human by the whole thing out off hit, but it was there in flanders in 1914 at these battles. It was his first encounter with combat and he wrote about it in his book, mine comp and said quote

Speaker 5:          00:40:56       at last. The day came when we left Munich to begin the fulfillment of our duty. For the first time I saw the Rhine as we rode westward along. That's quiet waters to defend it. The German stream of streams from the greed of the old enemy. When through the tender veil of the early morning mist, the neater vault monument gleamed down upon us in the gentle rays of the sun. The old watch on the Rhine roared out of the endless transport train into the morning sky, and I felt as though my heart would burst and then came a damp cold night in flanders through which we marched in silence and when the day began to emerge from the mist, suddenly an iron greeting came whizzing at us, over our heads and with the sharp report sent the little pellets flying between our ranks, ripping up the wet ground, but even before the little clouded passed from 200 throats, the first hurrah rose to meet the first messengers of death.

Speaker 5:          00:41:50       Then a crackling and a roaring and a singing. In a howling began and with feverish eyes. Each one of us was drawn forward faster and faster until suddenly passed turnip fields and hedges. The fight began the fight of man against man and from the distance, the strains of a song reached our ears coming closer and closer, leaping from company to company just as death plunged a busy hand into our ranks. The song reached us too, and we passed it along. Deutschland, Deutschland, Uber, Uber, lesson develop. Four days later, we came back, even our staff had changed. Seventeen year old boys now looked like men. The volunteers of the list regiment may not have learned to fight properly, but they knew how to die like soldiers. This was the beginning. He said, thus it went on year after year, but the romance of battle had been replaced by horror. The enthusiasm gradually cooled and the exuberant joy was stifled by mortal fear.

Speaker 5:          00:42:48       The time came when every man had to struggle between the instinct of self preservation and the admonitions of duty. I too was not spared by the struggle always. When death was on the hunt of vague, something tried to revolt, strove to represent itself to the weak body is reason. Yet it was only cowardice, which in such disguises tries to ensnare the individual, a grave tugging and warning set in, and often it was only the last remnant of conscience which decided the issue. Yet the more this voice admonished one to caution, the louder and more insistent it's lures. The sharper resistance grew until at last. After a long inner struggle, consciousness of duty emerged victorious.

Speaker 5:          00:43:30       By the winter of Nineteen 15, 1916, he writes, this struggle had been for me, decided at last. My will was undisputed master, if in the first day is I wonder over the top with rejoicing and laughter, I was now column and determined and this was enduring. Now, fate could bring on the ultimate tests without my nerves shattering or my reason failing. The young volunteer had become an old soldier and this transformation had occurred in the whole army. It had issued hard and old from the eternal battles and for those who could not stand up under the storm while they were broken and quote, Hitler would actually leap out into no man's land under a hail of bullets and try to rescue a commanding officer by putting them on his back and carrying him back to the German lines. It will be decorated by the Kaiser for this, even though the man he rescued died,

Speaker 5:          00:44:28       what Hitler is talking about in this struggle, but he has to go through to try to make himself do something that the entire urges of humanity inside a human being, you know, argue against is something that every soldier in the war who's going to face this kind of carnage needs to, you know, deal with at one point or another, sometimes they don't even have control over what happens. People will be affected by the storm of steel is Ernst Junger. We'll call it later in the war in different ways, sometimes consciously, but sometimes in a way that defies even what they want to do. Now. One of the things that the human side of the first World War requires us to look at is how and why are these people doing these things. Intelligent human beings from the modern era. Look at what our grandfathers and great grandfathers did in this conflict and can understand how and why they did it.

Speaker 5:          00:45:25       Part of it is the romance and the heroism and the idea of duty and what's expected of them, and some of that is what motivates soldiers to continue to press forward in unbelievable situations in combat even today, but there were other elements in play, less savory elements. We were dealing with modern nation states who had ways of compelling a certain level of behavior. There were a lot of people who were not brave in this combat on all sides or whose bodies simply would not do with their mind and told them to do. Those people often had to be sacrificed. As an example to others.

Speaker 5:          00:46:05       In 1914, a British brigadier general name e l spears wrote about one of those methods that the modern state and really states had for some time before this use to compel their troops to be brave and to do their duty, and he wrote quote generally my day had just been roused from sleep on the straw or the shed and was standing in the street when a little group of unmistakable proport came around the corner. 12 soldiers and an NCO, a firing party. A couple of gendarmes in between them and unarmed soldier. My heart sank and a feeling of horror overcame me and execution was about to take place generally my day took a look and then held up his hand so that the party halted and with a characteristic quickstep went up to the doomed man. He asked what he had been condemned for. It was for abandoning his post.

Speaker 5:          00:46:59       The general then began to talk to the man. Quite simply, he explained, disciplined to him, abandoning your post was letting down your pals more. It was letting down your country that look to you to defend her. He spoke of the necessity of example, how some could do their duty without prompting, but others less strong had to know and understand the supreme cost of failure. He told the condemned man that his crime was not Venal, not low, and then he must die as an so that others should not fail. Surprisingly, the rich agreed nodding his head. The burden of infamy was lifted from his shoulders. He saw a glimmer of something redemption in his own eyes, a real hope, though he knew he was going to die, the general went on carrying the man with him to comprehension that any sacrifice was worthwhile if it helped France ever so little.

Speaker 5:          00:47:54       What did anything mad or if he knew this? Finally, the general held out his hand, meaning to shake the condemned person's hand. Yours is also a way of dying for France. She said the procession started again, but now the victim was a willing one. The sound of a volley in the distance announced that all was over general demo day wiped the beads of perspiration from his brow and for the first time, perhaps his hands trembled as he lit his pipe, and that's something that all sides will do in this war. It's a way of saying that yes, you may face certain death if you walk into the storm that is modern combat, but you'll also face certain death if you don't.

Speaker 5:          00:48:38       It's very important though to bear in mind that the fact that these soldiers who failed in their duty somehow are exposed to capital punishment, does not mean that that's why soldiers fought. That's something that has been present in most armies throughout history since ancient times. Heck, the Romans, if your unit fought badly, would make the men draw lots and one out of every 10 soldiers in the unit would be killed. That was called decimation, and to add insult to injury, the Romans would make their comrades killed them. So that's a standard part of warfare. Throughout most of history. Most of these soldiers were fighting for much higher values. Things that to the more cynical 21st century mind sometimes almost sounded like you know, military recruiting, marketing slogans, but they meant something to these people and they mean something to soldiers today, duty, honor, country, sovereign God, and what's more, once the soldiers get into combat a responsibility to your comrades. Nonetheless, the first world war is able to take one of the most extreme activities humans ever take part in warfare and make it worse and start, for example, with what trench warfare means for the soldiers on the ground in terms of day to day living. Go out in your backyard, dig yourself a hole, sit down in it in the rain and just live in a day after day without any bombs, guns, bullets, or murderous combat and it's horrible. That's what these face, most of them in Flanders, one of the rainiest parts of Europe, they live in the mud

Speaker 5:          00:50:33       and they can't quite get their mind around how that changes this whole romantic idea of adventurous combat that so many of them signed up for. Take for example, some of the most elite units in Francis military men who were in the French Foreign Legion and he will find themselves in holes in the ground.

Speaker 5:          00:50:54       Alan Seeger, who will die on the western front in 1916. Rights as this trench warfare is getting started. Quote, this style of trench warfare is extremely modern and for the artillery men is doubtless very interesting, but for the poor common soldier, it is anything but romantic. His role is to simply dig himself a hole in the ground and keep hidden in it as tightly as possible, continually under the fire of the opposing batteries. He is yet never allowed to get a glimpse of the enemy exposed to all the dangers of war, but none of it's enthusiasms or splendid Elon. He is condemned to sit like an animal limits burrow and hear the shells whistle over his head and take their little daily toll from his comrades. His feet are numb, his canteen frozen, but he's not allowed to make a fire. He's not even permitted to light a candle. He must fold himself up in his blanket and lie down, cramped in the dirty straw to sleep as best as he may. How different from the popular notion of the evening campfire, the songs, and the good cheer and quote.

Speaker 5:          00:52:02       It's after the battles up in flanders on the ane and an IPA or this trench warfare sets in the German soldier. Rudolph binder tries to explain what's happening in 1914 when he writes, quote, the war has got stuck into a gigantic siege on both sides. The whole front is one endless fortified trench. Neither side has the forced to make a decisive push. Everyone seems settled on a winter campaign, but as far as I can judge, there is no possibility of an early finish. We are still stuck here for perfectly good reasons. One might as well say for perfectly bad reasons. This business may last for a long time. End Quote.

Speaker 5:          00:52:43       Now, it's important to remember that most of the people who are finding themselves stuck in this business in 1914 aren't really soldiers. Soldiers might be expected to deal with this kind of incredible experience, but most of the troops in these uniforms and carrying weapons, which you know for all intents and purposes, appeared to be soldiers six or eight weeks ago were civilians. They were shopkeepers and delivery boys and students and insurance salesmen and teachers who all of a sudden find themselves in circumstances that they just can't make sense of horrible situations. Many of these people had never seen a dead body in their lives and then all of a sudden find themselves in situations like this German soldier in 1914 describing this new phenomenon of trench life day to day, living in a hole in the ground with combat going on all around you, and he writes, quote, the dangers of trench life may be realized when I say that often neither the dead nor wounded can be removed.

Speaker 5:          00:53:51       If you put up as much as a little finger above the edge of the trench, the bullets come whizzing around immediately. The dead bodies must therefore be allowed to remain in the trench. That is to say the dead man has got rid of by digging a grave for him in the floor of the trench. A few days ago a soldier was so badly hit by a shell that he was cut into his shattered body, could not be removed without risk to the survivors and was therefore allowed to remain, but presently he gave rise to a horrible stench and whatever they did, the men could not get away from the mutilated blackened features. Sometimes arms and legs torn away from the body are allowed to lie about the bottom of the trench until someone can bury them. One gets hardened in time and to quote, getting hardened in time is what's happening during this period.

Speaker 5:          00:54:44       In 1914, once the fighting of these major first battles died down because this is when the reinforcements arrived and the reinforcements are not part of the regular army. These are the civilians from a short time ago, thrown into uniform and sent into this hell of combat. It's a little bit different for the veterans, especially the professionals, the British professional army, you know that existed before the war started. The so called old contemptible. Our being, as we said, widdled down to practically nothing, but there's a few of them left and they're trying to integrate these former civilians into their ranks without getting killed in the process because those people don't know the ropes yet and they're doing things that scare the regulars. John Lucy, one of the old contemptible in the Irish Guards in the BDF writes, quote, we stood to in the wet shell holes and crumbling trenches under the thunder and blasting flashes of German high explosives.

Speaker 5:          00:55:43       There is no need to describe this bombardment except to say that it was the worst of my experience. A few of our fellows broke under it and one poor chap entirely lost his head and ran back out of his trench. He had not a chance in the open. The earth was vomiting all around us and he tumbled over in a few yards better to have kept to the trench. No trained soldier would leave that. A corporal, a burly fellow fell near me where the shrapnel bullet in his head, he lay unconscious all the day nodding his hold head as if suffering only from some slight irritation. And did not become still until evening. Earlier in the day one youngster said, what about putting him out of his misery? A more experienced man explained that there was no pain. The smallest stirrings and little mons came from a man who was then already as good as dead.

Speaker 5:          00:56:34       Another soldier, Lucy says, had his belly ripped open and sat supporting his back against a trench. While he gazed with fascinated eyes at large coils of his own guts, which he held in both hands. This was almost the gasoline aside. I saw it's sequel was better. The man's entrails had not been penetrated. He got safe out of the trench, was washed, tucked in, and mended well in hospital maimed men past crouching and crawling behind me, leaving trails of blood on the ground on their way to a ditch witch lead back into the woods behind. Some of them were moaning to loud. Unlike our old men, he means the veterans. One young militia man in particular came by roaring and seeking sympathy for a broken arm from everyone. He met. A lance corporal told him that for God's sake to put a sock in it, and then if he were really badly wounded, he would have no breath left to howl that stopped his hysterics. I should say that the non coms of the old army had the worst time of all trying in circumstances like these to keep inexperienced men in hand. Some of these men could not even fire a rifle properly and at times our hearts quailed for our safety and theirs and quote

Speaker 5:          00:57:51       this experience was so unlike with the soldiers of the day. We're accustomed to that minister of war and war hero himself, Lord her ratio, kitchener and Britain famously said, when seeing what this whole deal was like, this is not war. Well, maybe it hadn't been, but this was sort of a way of telling everyone in this generation, welcome to the 20th century. This is how it's going to be for awhile.

Speaker 5:          00:58:25       These battles in flanders, like dre shatter many of the leaders confidence in what's going on. Remember when the war starts, they have a plan for winning the war. That's been worked out over years, but once that fails, all these generals have to improvise. They have to create new offensive and new ways to win the war from where things stand and after these battles in flanders die down and you have this trench warfare setting in general, Vulcan Vulcan Hine in Germany runs the numbers and they're horrible. I mean the battle at Ipa, all sides combined. You're talking about another 250,000 casualties in a few weeks. That brings the German totals on the western front. Since the war started, which is August to more than 750,000. The French are topping a million. The British had, for all intents and purposes, lost their army, the greatest

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       in the world, small but the greatest in the world. It's down to dozens of many new units that had hundreds of men, you know, a very short time ago and in Britain they're trying to scrape up replacements and you can see how, how bad it is by how quickly they're changing the requirements. Because when the war starts, you have to be five foot eight inches tall to be in the British army in October. They lower that to five foot five inches tall, a single month later in November, they lower that to five foot three inches tall. The Germans are having a similar problem. They learned a very hard lesson in these battles in flanders. You must let the troops finished their training because they threw away a ton of lives with people who weren't ready to fight, but fall. Heinz got a more difficult situation because the British and the French, as we said, have dominions and Commonwealth nations. I mean the Canadians alone in a fit of patriotism are sending more than 30,000 fresh troops across the Atlantic in the largest transportation of troops, you know, in the history of the world across the large oceans on Falcon high and has to account for this and he can't. He goes and he tells the civilian leadership that the war in the west can't be worn anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:00:39       He tells them that they have to come to some sort of an arrangement and he suggests making peace with somebody, maybe the Russians, because if you make peace with the Russians, maybe the French will lose heart. He says all of these other nations are simply weapons in the hands of the arch enemy, which is England, and that they have to be that the British have to be the ones that the Germans focused on and we have to get these other countries which are merely swords in the hand of perfidious albion and he says, we have to get them out of the war.

Speaker 1:          01:01:09       Now. This is going to be very hard to do because way back in September, all the allies sign these agreements saying nobody will make a separate peace nonetheless high and hopes that he can make his war aims. You know, no longer victory but shattering some of these powers. So they leave the war. The civilian leadership in Germany, the politicians like Beckman whole veg are appalled by what Falcon High and tells them they can't figure out a way to do this because the German, just like all these other countries are so appalled by the casualties and the blood that's been spilled that nobody is willing to give up anything. You've already lost too many people. It's one thing if you lose all those people in a victory to another thing. If you lose all those people in a loss besides Beth holding just a couple of months ago was writing up plans for what the victory conditions in the war are going to be and he's got these grandiose schemes where we're going to push the Russians back. We're going to keep the French down forever. We're going to have all these vassal states and now his chief military leader is saying, listen, we can't win the war

Speaker 1:          01:02:12       now. Fun Fall. Get Heinz rivals guys like Luton, door from the east who already hate him this early say that his attitude,

Speaker 5:          01:02:20       you know this early in the war, is tantamount to treason and basically insinuating in no uncertain terms that I change in military leadership might change all these sorts of things. When on Falcon Highness told that there's no way that we're ending the war. He tells his troops on the western front to hold onto what you have. Never surrender a square foot of what you've won. If you do counterattack immediately and retake it because they've taken valuable territory, valuable farmland, valuable resources, valuable industrial land from the French, and if he can't get the war stopped from the political leadership, he's going to hold onto what he has. He tells the troops on the west to deepen their fortifications instead of just one line of trenches. He wants multiple lines of trenches. He and all the other leaders on both sides begin to use this wonderful weapon which doesn't seem like a weapon at all of barbed wire.

Speaker 5:          01:03:14       Something that was first invented a generation before to keep cattle pending in the American west. And in the last couple of wars since then, had been used sparingly and sort of experimentally now all sides take this wire with all these sharp edges and begin to use it as a fortification. This will be another one of these iconic things on the western front and you don't even think that something like wire with little teeny barbs on it will make that much of a difference, but it proves to be one of the most important elements of the of the war on the western front. You can even make a case that they will invent weapon systems which still dominate militaries today, simply to overcome the barrier created by things like barbed wire. Now it's not all bad news for the central powers in Germany is 1914 wines down. Sure General [inaudible] high and has decided that he can't see a way to victory on the western front, but there's fighting going on on other fronts to his main ad.

Speaker 5:          01:04:16       This areas in Germany, Germany's high command, the ever more powerful team of Hindenburg and Ludendorff are believers that you can win the war by beating the Russians. They will become part of the group of German generals that will be known as easterners, people that think you can win the war by being victorious in the East Falcon Hines, one of these guys who you know as part of the cabal known as the Westerners, believers that any real victory in the war will come on the western front, but there are new fronts opening up his 19, 14 winds down strange fronts to first of all, we haven't even mentioned that there's fighting going on in the Pacific because it really is a sidebar to this story. Japan, for example, once the war breaks out quickly, throws in their lot with Britain and France and Russia and the allies, they do so for purely opportunistic reasons.

Speaker 5:          01:05:07       The Germans have some territories in the Pacific that Japan can easily snap up. It won't be much fighting. It won't be much trouble, and if the allies somehow lose the war, there's not much. Germany and Austria, Hungary and stuff can do to Japan way over in the Pacific anyway. There's no downside to the Japanese snap up. Some of these German island possessions in the Pacific that takes some German territories on the Asian mainland and the most important part of all of those actions will be the fact that some of those places will be battle grounds in the Second World War and also that Japan's taking of German possessions on the Asian mainland help precipitate later war between Japan and China, which will help create the conditions where the Japanese are part of the Pacific War and the Second World War. I mean it's more of a long term situation. I mean it's more of a longterm cancerous situation, but Japan's been in the war since the beginning.

Speaker 5:          01:06:03       It's part of what makes this a world war. But in November 19, 14, Turkey enters the war and this is a very different situation. First of all, the Turks are not united on the idea at all. Some of the more aggressive, you know, members of the government who are now called the young Turks sort of precipitated in a way that leaves the rest of the government out of the decision. They in some Germans working together decide to shell some Russian port facilities and the Black Sea without getting the rest of the government's position, and then of course Russia declares war on Turkey and boom, they're in, but the Germans had been trying to set this up for a long time. They wanted Turkey on their side, which is strange because Turkey is one of those powers that's really having a hard time right now and the Germans already have one of those.

Speaker 5:          01:06:53       They're allied to Austria, Hungary, which you know in four or five months of war already looks done. The Germans will take to saying about they're Austrian allies that they are fettered to a corpse. Well now they're adding another corpse. I mean, you really have to admire how well Germany does in this war, considering that they have to have the weakest powers in Europe, not just on their side but requiring a lot of their help, but the Turks provide an interesting use to the Germans. It's not that they have an army and navy that's going to be real helpful, but the Turks control a nice chunk of what today we would call the Middle East and by simply deciding to get into the war, they forced the British and the French who have a lot of possessions in that area to defend them. They've expanded the battlefield to include a whole bunch of areas that nobody was fighting over before.

Speaker 5:          01:07:48       Turkey got into the war. What's more turkeys? Historic enemy is Russia a Russia that is putting all their manpower to dealing with the Germans and the ostrow Hungarians and all of a sudden south of all that fighting, they now have their historic enemy Turkey in the war. Again, it's not that they're so afraid of the Turks, it's they're afraid of taking any troops away from the main battle front to defend that area at all. Same thing with the British and the French. Now they have to take troops away from places where they're using them against the Germans and use them elsewhere so the Germans aren't really getting. The Turkish armies help as much as they're getting. You know, the fact that the people they're fighting have to fight somewhere else too.

Speaker 5:          01:08:36       Now, for our purposes, there's a wonderful little moment right at the beginning of Turkey's involvement where the highest ranking figure in the Muslim world, religious wise, proclaims a jihad against the allies against Britain, France, Russia, Serbia, and this is an era where the Muslim world was, was more united in a religious sense. I mean, nowadays it's more like the Protestant version of Christianity where there's a lot of different religious leaders who kind of all have equal standing at this time period. The guy who was running the religion from Turkey had not total control over the religion, but he carried a lot of weight and when the war breaks out on November 14th, 19, 14, he proclaims a holy war against Britain, France, Serbia, Russia, and this is big because Britain, France, and Russia all have huge Muslim populations and Germany's ambassador to Turkey. He says that now you know the British are going to burn up in Jihad.

Speaker 5:          01:09:40       Whether or not that's what really happens. If you're Britain and France and you're Russia, you need to be concerned about that and now you need to divert forces from other crucial fronts to deal with this new dilemma. Now, Turkey is and has been for more than 100 years known as the sick man of Europe. They've just fought two wars before the first world war, breaks out the first and second Balkan war and lost most of those European possessions there. Penniless. It's a disaster. They just bought two battleships, which they had to ask their citizens to essentially donate the money for. They purchased them from Britain, and then when the war broke out, Britain kept them, which was another reason the church were not too happy with the allies. Nonetheless, the fact that Turkey is going to be in the war means that the British who have controlled Egypt for some time now have to worry about Egypt. I have to worry about the Suez Canal. Also. This is the era where oil is finally becoming important in uh, right before the first world war breaks out, Britain lays down it's first ships that are going to burn oil instead of coal and everybody is starting to see that not only is oil important, but the Middle East is a place that has a lot of it and now the Middle East is going up in flames.

Speaker 5:          01:11:04       Some of those flames probably would have been very welcome on the eastern front at this point where the Russians and the Germans and the ostrow Hungarians are locked in mortal combat because it begins

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       to freeze at the end of the year as one might expect they may be dealing with in a rain and historic cold, one of the coldest winters on memory on the western front, but the coldest winters in memory on the western front are pretty darn average on the eastern front and the weather conditions slow. Everyone down, the eastern commanders, Hindenburg and Ludendorff also don't have enough troops to do anything truly momentous. They keep begging Falcon hine in the Kaiser for them and they keep getting rebuffed. The Russians are inapt when they're attacking, but they're very tough when they're defending, so things tend to slow down and the Russians tend to go on the defensive. The Austral Hungarians are already almost done, you know, five months into the war and they're fighting the last offensive that they will launch independently in the whole war. They already have a giant fortress with 150,000 Austro-hungarian troops in it, surrounded by the Russians.

Speaker 1:          01:12:12       It's a bad situation. The weather slows everything down and if you actually try to follow the various battles going on, you'll notice that there's a rhythm to them that makes it difficult for anything to ever be solved. I mean, one side moves forward, the other side moves back and then you know, they reversed course. I'm historian Peter Hart does a pretty good rundown of the rhythm of the eastern front at this time and sums up the way the first six months of war ends. You know, in Philadelphia and Poland and places like that. When he writes, quote the seesaw nature of the fighting in the east two steps forward, three steps back. One step forward was becoming increasingly apparent to all along the line in the north for all their efforts, the Russians only managed to hold onto a token sliver of east Prussia. In contrast, they lost much of Russian Poland to the German advance, but the strategic drawback of occupying this territory was such that it was not a particular disadvantage in the broader scheme of things.

Speaker 1:          01:13:15       It was in the south against the Austrians that the Russians had made their biggest gains as they had overrun nearly all of Austrian Galitzianers. Just as on the western front. The scale of the forces involved had been incredible. By the end of the year, 143 Russian divisions faced 53 Austrian and 38 German divisions. Losses on all sides had been simply breathtaking. By the end of 1914, up to 750,000 Russian soldiers, 500,000 Austro-hungarian and 140,000 Germans had become casualties. All this in just five frantic months of mayhem and the quote, it will await a change in weather conditions before that front heats up. Again. Throughout this most inhumane of conflicts, there are tons of stories of prisoners being killed and horrible things being

Speaker 5:          01:14:12       done all over. I mean when you have millions and millions of men involved in warfare, there are going to be stories that run the gamut. The ones though that sort of reinforce, you know, your connection to humanity are there too and they deserve to be pointed out. Sometimes they were on an individual level. There's a story from the western front that I like right around the time of pray about a British soldier named Willie Frazier who was wounded in the shoulder and who gets stuck, you know, in place as the Germans overrun his position and the stories were counted by author Winston groom. Here's groom talking about frazier injured on the battlefield. Quote, his shoulder had been shattered by shrapnel. There was fighting and killing all around and the Germans captured him. Having studied German in Frankfurt in 1909, he was astonished to hear a German sergeant yell out in order to shoot him. Will. He yelled to a German officer and when the officer spoke, really recognized his accent and he asked if he was from Frankfurt when the officer replied that he was Willie, asked him in German, don't you wish you were there? Now the two men exchanged forced grins and the officer ordered his men not to harm frazier and quote.

Speaker 5:          01:15:30       You can find stories like that all throughout the war. People whose humanity shines through on an individual basis, on all sides. By the way, no one had a monopoly on that, but there were times when the humanity sort of just burst forth and mass spontaneously. None more famous may be overrated. Some people say, but I don't see how it can be overrated than what happened on Christmas Eve. Nineteen, 14. Especially on the western front. The conditions are horrible. It's freezing. You know your feet are stuck in gruelle mud water, but you can't get any worse, and then it all freezes in. You're stuck out there in the cold and then all of a sudden the people on the western front see something relatively unbelievable in a conflict where you have shells going on every second, snipers picking off anyone who raises his head above the trench and then all of a sudden soldiers reported hearing, singing, and seeing weird colored lights. The colored lights were often coming from the German trenches. Soldier Yulia is collection was in one of those trenches opposite the French saying the conditions were horrible, but on Christmas Eve, this is what happened. Quote

Speaker 5:          01:16:52       Christmas in the trenches. It was bitterly cold. We had procured a pine tree for there were no for trees to be had. We had decorated the tree with candles and cookies. We had imitated the snow with wadding. Christmas trees were burning everywhere in the trenches and at midnight all the were lifted onto the pair of it with their burning candles. And along the whole line, German soldiers began to sing Christmas songs in chorus, old Thou blissful old thou joyous mercy, bringing Christmas time.

Speaker 5:          01:17:23       Hundreds of men he writes, were singing the song in that fearful would not. A shot was fired. The French had ceased firing along the whole line. That night I was with a company that was only five paces away from the enemy. The Christmas candles were burning brightly and were renewed again and again for the first time. We heard no shots from everywhere throughout the forest. He writes one good hear, powerful Carol's come floating over peace on earth and such. The French, he says, left their trenches and stood on the parapet without any fear there. They stood quite overpowered by emotion and all of them with cap in hand. We too had issued from our trenches. We exchange gifts with the French chocolate, cigarettes, etc. They were all laughing and so where we why? We did not know, then everybody went back to his trench and incessantly the carol resounded evermore, solidly, evermore longingly. Oh Thou blissful and quote

Speaker 5:          01:18:23       private william quinten in the trenches on christmas eve, on the british side wrote about a similar situation farther down the line, quote all around us lay about three inches of snow. A typical picture postcard christmas, things were very quiet, that peace and goodwill to all men feeling seemed to be in the air. We could hear the germans still strafing up separate way, but the next night, christmas eve even up there, it was much quieter. Something in the direction of the german lines caused us to rub our eyes and look again here and they're showing just above the parapet we could see very faintly would look like very small colored lights. What was this? Was it some prearranged signal and the fore runner of an attack or was it to make us curious and thus expose ourselves to a sudden raking of machine gun fire? We were very suspicious and we were discussing the strange move of the enemy when something even stranger happened.

Speaker 5:          01:19:19       The germans were actually singing not very loud, but there was no mistaking it. We began to get interested. The enemy, at least we're going to enjoy themselves as much as the circumstances would permit. Suddenly across the snow clad, no man's land. A strong clear voice rang out singing the opening lines of annie lori. It was sung in perfect english and we were spellbound. No other sound, but this unknown singer's voice to us. It seemed like the war had suddenly stopped, stopped to listen to this song from one of the enemy, not a sound from friend or foe, and as the last notes died away, a spontaneous outburst of clapping arose from our trenches encore, good old fritz. End quote.

Speaker 5:          01:20:05       All along the line, the two sides would have this interesting moment where they kind of began to emerge from the trenches little by little, you know, a place where they couldn't stick a finger up without having a shot off just hours before and everybody must have been so incredibly brave to try, but one side would raise themselves up a little bit and the other side would raise themselves up a little bit more until both sides. In this hellish environment where nobody could go anywhere near, you know the open air. We're standing apart from each other, gazing right at the enemy in no man's land on christmas, private. William quintin again wrote quote, as daylight crept in, we were surprised to see the germans waist high out of their trenches, gazing across at us with impunity. Imagine the position, whereas yesterday, the mere sight of a bit of field gray uniform would have caused a dozen british rifles to crack.

Speaker 5:          01:21:06       Here was the enemy in full view of us gazing serenely across no man's land at us, and we had him to us in the front line. The whole world had changed. We could take stock of our surroundings that are leisure. At 9:00 precisely, the german burying party climbed from the trenches, shovels and picks on their shoulders. They advanced about 10 yards in our direction and waited. Expectedly a word from our company officer and our party were soon out. The officers looked on, apparently conversing the digging party soon lost interest in their task and before long we're busy, fraternizing cigarettes were being exchanged and they seem to be enjoying themselves immensely. Needless to say, before very long, we in the trenches were soon out on top sauntering about the snow, but keeping this side of wire entanglements. Likewise, the germans for the whole of that day and for many days to come friend and foe mixed freely out on no man's land, except for the fact that a few of the enemy could speak a little english.

Speaker 5:          01:22:08       We found the language difficulty, a bar to conversation, but we may do with signs and gestures. I remember distinctly a german holding out an open box of chocolates for me to take one. The germans wanted to play a football match on no man's land, but our officers would not allow it and the quote, there are reports though of british and german troops engaging in soccer matches up and down the line. It was an amazing spontaneous outburst of humanity and it's so appalled the higher leadership that they made sure in future christmases, nothing like this would ever be allowed. Again, if you thought the war was bad before it's about to get worse and I'll let winston churchill. He in a leadership position during this part of the war setup 1915 a time when he says men lost control of the conflict and forces took over.

Speaker 5:          01:23:10       He wrote, quote, the year 19, 15 was faded to be disastrous to the cause of the allies and the whole world. By the mistakes of this year, the opportunity was lost of confining the conflagration within limits, which though enormous we're not uncontrolled. Thereafter, the fire roared on until it burned itself out. Thereafter, events past very largely outside the scope of conscious choice governments and individuals conformed to the rhythm of the tragedy and suede and staggered forward in helpless violence, slaughtering and squandering on ever increasing scales till injuries were brought to the structure of human society, which a century will not have face and which may conceivably proved fatal to the presence civilization. But in january 19, 15, the terrific affair was still not unmanageable. It could have been grasped and human hands and brought to rest in righteous and fruitful victory. Before the world was exhausted, before the nations were broken, before the empires were shattered to pieces before europe was ruined, it was not to be he writes, mankind was not to escape so easily from the catastrophe in which it had involved itself.

Speaker 5:          01:24:22       Pride was everywhere to be humbled and nowhere to receive it. Satisfaction, no splendid harmony was to crown the wonderful achievements, no prize to reward the sacrifices of the combatants. Victory was to be bought, so deer has to be almost indistinguishable from defeat. It was not to give even security to the victors. There never was to be the silence following the great words of peace to the convulsions of the struggle must succeed. The impotent turmoil of the aftermath, noble hopes high comradeship and glorious daring. We're in every nation to lead only to disappointment, disillusion, and frustration. The sufferings and impoverishment of peoples might arrest their warfare. The collapse of the defeated might still the cannonade, but their hatreds continue on appeased and their quarrels are still unsettled. The most complete victory ever gained in arms has failed to solve the european problem or to remove the dangers which produced the war. End quote, the war was entering a new phase. The phase of stalemate. What do you do to break the stalemate?

Speaker 5:          01:25:35       That Was the main challenge facing commanders on all sides. As 1915 rolls around and you know later in the war, the allied generals especially will get labeled, you know, as butchers and and and blockheads and people who can't think their way out of a paper bag and and some of it's justified later in the conflict, but we have to cut them quite a lot of slack early on because as the western front in the trench warfare and everything begins to, all of these generals on all sides are confronted with circumstances that there are no metrics for. There is no data on how you deal with this. They have to learn, they have to experiment and then they have to look at the data afterwards. The problem is is in this conflict, in the experimentation in this military laboratory, human beings have the lab rats and you learn that the cost of human carnage.

Speaker 5:          01:26:29       Now the allies are more willing to do this. They have more lab rats to play with and this becomes a huge feature in the early part of 1915 because if you are sir John French, the british commander, or if you are joseph shaft for the french commander, you know that if this thing has devolved from a wild swinging boxing encounter in the first round, just something that's more like a wrestling match where both combatants are holding each other in a death grip, that that works in your favor. You're the stronger combatant. You have more men, you have more industrial power. you control the seas. If it's going to go that way, you're going to win. Now, you may not want to have to be as hurt as you may have to be to make that work, but worst case scenario, long term, you're going to win that encounter.

Speaker 5:          01:27:13       It's the german commanders that are forced to think outside the box because they're not going to win that encounter. The problem is, is the box that they have to think outside of is the one that was worked on for decades before the first world war came out to create laws of war, humanitarian restrictions on what you could do, ways to protect civilians, noncombatants, and even combatants from, you know, things that were considered to be unsportsmanlike or extra horrific, more horrific than it needed to be. Remember in the first episode we talked about things like the hague conference, ways to make war conform to international law. The problem was the germans in the central powers, we're now in that position that everyone kind of knew was going to happen. You know when you wrote those laws of war, which is they have to decide whether or not adhering to international law is worth losing a war over and you begin to see both sides try to use asymmetrical warfare and new technology to break the stalemate and a lot of what used are the very things that were prohibited in these prewar agreements. A perfect example starts in late 1914 when german warships open fire on british coastal towns kill more than 100 british citizens, uh, becomes a wonderful propaganda tool for the allies to cite the baby killers of Germany. But that's nothing compared to what's coming in 1915. The first thing that happens is a absolute benchmark in warfare. When in january the germans start really trying to get involved in what we call today strategic bombing. Now, aircraft had been in use since the very moment the war started.

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       One of the excuses that the germans used for attacking France was they said that some plane had come from France and bombed nurenberg at the very moment that the war started, which is probably nonsense, but it shows that there were airplanes involved in the conflict from the very beginning, but in ways that really didn't involve the laws of war very much. I mean all Of the air force's puT together in the world when the war started, had less than 500 planes. but what planes they did have turned out to be wonderfully valuable tools for reconnaissance, which was what air power had been used for earlier than this time. Even in the american civil war, there were hot air balloons that they would use to see what the enemy was doing in the distance. Planes were wonderful for that. They also turned out to be fantastic in the more technologically sophisticated armies at what was known as artillery spotting and that allowed your guns to shoot at targets that the gunners couldn't see.

Speaker 1:          01:30:04       You know, you could shoot, for example, you know, far away over a hill and if there was an airplane there that could tell you what was happening. And that was interesting enough to try to explain without radios and everything what was happening. But they could tell you that your shot fell short or went long or was too far to the left or too far to the right. And this gave a huge advantage to the armies that could make that work for them. The less sophisticated armies like the russians couldn't. And hence we're relegated to shooting at things. They could only see it, but this early on in the fighting, you can see how primitive things are because early on when aircraft would encounter enemy aircraft, they didn't have any way to do anything about it. I mean they were taking hand guns, these pilots up in the plane with them and trying to take pot shots with their pistols at the enemy air pilots.

Speaker 1:          01:30:50       I mean, that's how you know, sophisticated things are at this stage in the war. It's only when the germans run up against the trench warfare and the western front and they're forced to start looking for things that might help them break the stalemate that they noticed. They had the greatest zeplin fleet in the world. [inaudible] of course are lighter than air aircraft, like blimps, dirigibles, those kinds of things. And before the war, the germans had built 10 or 12 of them and had them sort of sitting aside when the war started, which scared their enemies probably more than they should have. They sort of had a fleet in being role where people like churchill in britain had to be, you know, worried about what are the journals, zipline is doing, what might the german zepplins do. That was probably out of all proportion to what the german zepplins could do.

Speaker 1:          01:31:39       The germans tried to use them at the beginning of the war, for example, when they invaded Belgium and had to try to deal with those forts. A couple of zepplins flew over and tried to drop some bombs, but when the stalemate on the western front reaches its real, you know, calcification moment, the germans start looking for ways to use these tools that they have and there is no metrics just like there aren't any metrics on the western front to try to figure out how to break that stalemate. There's no metrics that will tell you what the zepplins will do if they bomb targets in another country. There was a british theorist who suggested that the very powerlessness that people, you know in another country in their home country feel when the enemy is able to with impunity, fly over your territory and bomb you. He suggested that if they bombed the civilians with confetti, it wouldn't make any difference.

Speaker 1:          01:32:30       It would still damage their morale terribly because it's a feeling like you can't be defended even at home, a place that most people tend to feel safe at this stage in military history. There were people arguing, you know, in the german high command saying, for all we know these ziplines could win the war and before the war, at these big conferences that were part of trying to come up with international laws of war. You know, there were rules discussed about how bombing should work. I mean, should you have to give the city that you're going to bomb a chance to surrender before you bombed them and lest you think only the germans were doing this. Both the british and the french were sending small bombing raids over into Germany and Germany was sending small bombing raids with aircraft that were holding little hand bombs out of the open cockpits and dropping them.

Speaker 1:          01:33:17       Nothing significant. Nothing like sending large numbers of zeppelins all together in bombing raids. But in january, in 1915, the germans launched their first one of those, they go after some port facilities in britain. The problem with this is the same problem they're going to have in the early second world war, which is, you may say you're trying to hit military targets, but the accuracy is so terrible. You're lucky to fly over a city the size of london and be able to hit it. So these poor facilities end up being an example, an early example of when civilians get hit with these weapons, they'll start bombing london in may 19, 15. And of course this becomes a propaganda victory right away for the allies who again labeled the germans baby killers, which make the germans defensive. As you might imagine, there's a wonderful letter from a german zeplin leader, uh, to his mother trying to explain to her what apparently he's already tried to explain to her before that this isn't, you know, evil stuff, that this is modern warfaring.

Speaker 1:          01:34:20       Yes. It's not like, you know, nights fighting a duel, but at the same time the situation is different than when nights fought duals. People in the home front are no longer innocent in modern warfare. They are the ones who make the weapons that the soldiers require to fight. If the soldiers can't breakthrough on the western front, what if you could prevent one side from building the shells necessary to keep the war going? This is where the idea of the home front first really takes hold and it becomes the justification for attacking civilians in other countries. Here's the letter that the german zeplin leader Writes to his mother

Speaker 5:          01:34:58       trying to make his actions that he apparently feels guilty over himself. Sound morally okay.

Speaker 5:          01:35:06       We who strike the enemy where his heart beats have been slandered as baby killers and murderers of women. What we do is repugnant even to us, but necessary very necessary. Nowadays. There's no such animal as a noncombatant. Modern warfare is total warfare. A soldier cannot function at the front without the factory worker, the farmer, and all the other providers behind him. You will die. Mother have discussed this subject and I know you understand what I say. My man are brave and honorable there causes holy. How can they sin while doing their duty? If what we do is frightful, then may frightful be Germany, salvation end Quote. This same attitude will be applied to the other parts of warfare that rear their ugly head in 1915 because of the needs of the situation. I mean flame throwers are one of the technological weapons that will first appeared in 1915. Again, using science in ways to try to create openings, whether it taCtically on the battlefield or strategically in the war itself.

Speaker 5:          01:36:16       Another perfect example of this, when the first world war has to do with anothEr one of these new weapons systems that challenged age old theories and orthodoxies, one of them had to do with rules concerning naval blockades. You see, when the first world war breaks out, the british and the french navy literally sweep the cs clean of german shipping, Both military and merchant shipping. this sort of naval blockade was one of the main things that britain could offer early in the war. They certainly weren't going to offer millions and millions of troops. They didn't have millions and millions of troops. They had the greatest navy in the world and just like in napoleon's time when a strong continental power takes hold, you shut down their merchant shipping, you close their porch. You don't allow them to get any materials, resources, anything from anyone else. If you can help. Now, there were international laws concerning what you were allowed to keep from combatants. You weren't supposed to keep food stops or the needs of everyday life. You could keep weapons in those kinds of things, but the british and the french push those rules way past the boundaries of common sense and we're classifying things like cotton fabrics is war necessary materials. They weren't really going to allow anything through.

Speaker 5:          01:37:29       Now, for all of human history, there had been sort of a of a calculus you could count on and that's the. The weaker naval power cannot blockade the stronger naval power by see, how could you write your ships? Tried to blockade a country like great britain. They'll just send their navy out and sweep your ships off the sea. But what if your ships aren't on the c? What if the ships that are trying to blockade an island nation like britain or instead under the sea, the germans had some marines, this was not a brand new invention, but one that had finally reached a stage of effectiveness where the british were to find out that the old naval orthodoxies about what a weaker naval power could and couldn't do had changed. There was no answer at this point in history to the submarine surface. Vessels could not detect them, and unless the submarine surfaced, they couldn't destroy them.

Speaker 5:          01:38:29       Now, Germany had a lot less submarines than britain and France, but here's the thing. Britain and France couldn't do anything with their submarines. They couldn't use their submarines against german merchant shipping because there wasn't any german merchant shipping. About five minutes after the war breaks out, the surface fleets of France and britain saw to that, but germany's surface fleet, which was one of the things that had precipitated the war, one of the many causes that's always cited as the naval arms race between britain and Germany stayed in port. For the most part. Neither british nor the germans were willing to risk these enormously expensive and hard to replace surface ships that were the what are called capital ships, battleships, the really unbelievably expensive lenses. For example, the british had just commissioned to class ships known as the queen elizabeth class of battleships, which were so good in the first world war.

Speaker 5:          01:39:20       They'd still be very effective units in the second world war, but if a cheap little submarine could sink one of those ships with a torpedo, that's nothing that any naval commanders were willing to risk, and so all of a sudden, everybody's being so careful with their big ships that it leaves openings for the little ships to make a difference. Everyone thought at the beginning of the war that these submarines would be used in the military sense against other warships by february 19 slash 15. The germans are now using them against merchant shipping and all of a sudden the greatest navy in the world finds that they can't defend their merchant shipping because of a new technological creation. We're weAker. Naval power has the potential to turn the tables on the best weapon that the great naval powers have blockading weaker naval powers and the british who are doing a very good job of keeping goods and weapons from flowing into Germany by sea are finding out that the germans had the capability to do the same thing back to them.

Speaker 5:          01:40:21       Now the big issue will surface, if you'll pardon the pun, around whether or not the warfare should follow the old famous rules of the ce or not. The old famous rules of the c word that you didn't destroy, you know, merchant shipping nonmilitary vessels without letting them know that's piracy. You basically are supposed to give them a message and say, we're seizing your ship. Let them take their people off the ship on lifeboats and stuff, and then you can either sink the vessel that you were after or you can take it as a prize and Capture it. The problem is, when the submarines tried to do this, it opened them up to being destroyed and the british played this up. They started putting guns on all these merchant ships. So if the germans came up and did what they were supposed to do, tell the merchant ship were captured your prize of war.

Speaker 5:          01:41:11       Now get your life boats out, get your people off the ship and we'll sync it. They'd often pull the canvas off a gun and starts shooting at the now vulnerable submarine because it had, had to surface in order to comply with the international laws of war, right to the germans were having these debates in 1915 about whether or not they should do that at all. Maybe they should just sink these vessels without surfacing or warning them or anything. But this again would look like the germans were, you know, the ones outside international law were the ones who were the bad guys. And worse than that, they risked alienating neutral powers. The most important of which was the United States, which was a very, um, know maritime power, huge into trade. And by the way, at this point in the war, if you wanted to say who's gaining from the first world war, it's the United States because one of the things that all these powers do when they find out they can't produce enough shells and weapons and war materials to keep the war going, is borrow money from the United States and then turn around and spend that borrowed money on stuff and production from the United States often called the great neutral.

Speaker 5:          01:42:23       The United States just wants to be able to keep delivering their stuff where it has to go. They're already getting tense with the british, you know, searching their ships and saying that this shipper, that ship can dock at this porter, that port. But when the germans start sinking merchant vessels, sometimes those merchant vessels have americans on them. In early 1915, one of those vessels was called the lusitania. The lusitania, if you want to think of it, you know, to conceptualize what we're talking about here is very much like the titanic and extremely large ocean liner, a passenger ship. This is how people got from the old world, the new world, and back again across the atlantic in the days before transatlantic air flight. Now, controversy has raged ever since the german submarine, which opened fire on the lusitania, sank that ship on whether or not he was a legitimate target of war.

Speaker 5:          01:43:18       They did have munitions. If it did, supposedly they could sync it. There's a lot of evidence that suggested did and some conspiracy theories out there that suggests that people like winston churchill assured that it did so that it would be another nail in the coffin he was starting to construct that would eventually get the United States into the war. More than 100 americans were on the lusitania and died when it went down at various times in the war, the germans would start up what was called unrestricted submarine warfare, where they shot at anything that looked like enemy ship of any kind and other times where they would stop because there was a huge debate within the halls of german leadership over whether or not they gained more or last more when they did this. If the United States comes into the war, it's a huge loss, but it's one of the few ways that in 1915 they can see that they can bring britain to its knees. They can starve that island in ways that the british never could have imagined before the war because before the war they thought you had to have a bigger navy to do that. Technology had turned the tables on the greatest naval power in history.

Speaker 5:          01:44:28       The perhaps the most iconic asymmetrical warfare of this period has to do with something that was a big worry at the hague. Conferences in the late 18 hundreds and early 19 hundreds. Something that shows the desperation of the germans at this stage in the war that they would resort to this. It involves the use of what the hague conference called asphyxiating gases.

Speaker 5:          01:44:57       Everyone had realized by the late 18 hundreds that the modern chemical industry is. We would recognize it today, had come of age mean there were all sorts of explosive gunpowders and everything that we're so much more explosive than had been the case in napoleon's time, less than a century beforehand. So everyone was aware of the possibilities, but gunpowder and explosives were just more powerful versions of weapons that had been used for a very long time. The chemical industry made possible the use of weapons that had never been used and that no one knew. You know, what the effects if they were used, would be. And so with the hague conference in 1899, the issue was addressed. The conference outlawed the use of poison or poisoned weapons, arms projectiles or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering and projectiles designed for the diffusion of is fixating or deleterious gases and to quote. But in 1915, Germany is looking at all these laws of war through a completely different lens as we said, the tradeoff between follow international law or lose the war.

Speaker 5:          01:46:10       What's more, they're dealing with this front. As we sat on the western front that had solidified in interesting ways. As we said, you have a continuous trench system from the swiss border all the way you know, up to the ocean. And the interesting part is a lot of that territory is not really good fighting ground. A lot of it's to marshy. A lot of it's to forest did a lot of it. The germans are in such an amazingly strong position. You'd be an idiot to challenge them, which leaves the same few spots as good areas to launch offensive, you know, campaigns, which means that those areas become the most horrific battlefields in human history because they basically don't move very much for the entire war and the same ground is plowed up by artillery shells over and over again. The people that die in, some of these places are never buried and so you have a charnel house of horrors of people who have just been killed the other day.

Speaker 5:          01:47:14       People that were killed a month ago, people that were killed a year ago, all in the same spot and you as the soldier have to live in this environment and that of course ignores the more mundane aspects, which is if you are trapped in a trench and you can't move without being shot, where do you go to the bathroom? I mean early on in the combat, british soldiers were talking about taking the german helmets with the spikes on them as souvenirs for the war, but quickly realized that the best thing you could do with those things is used them as a receptacle for the call of nature and then toss it as far away from the trenches possible so that the smell of thousands of men doing this in a confined space over years doesn't overwhelm you. As We said, certain battlegrounds like ipa will become famous for their smell and you will be able to smell them before you get anywhere near them.

Speaker 5:          01:48:04       The canadians are arrivinG in early 1915 in numbers and they take over some of these battlefields. You know where nothing has changed. I mean no one's gone out and buried anybody. That was one of the things, by the way, during the christmas truce is that we talked about that was the number one thing both sides tried to do, which tells you how crazy the smell and the situation and now horrifying it must have been, but they jump out of these trenches and start to try to bury these bodies that have been out there for months. Canadian soldier on the western front arriving at the trenches of eat in early 1915 trenches that had been occupied by the grca forces from around India and a canadian sergeant name sv britain describes his, you know, welcome to the western front in suitably horrific terms. He says, quote, left at 6:30 PM for reserve trenches and reached our reserved dugouts via st julian just rat holes.

Speaker 5:          01:49:06       One hell of an accommodation. Got to the trenches as a fatigue party with steak and sandbags, and though there were reserved trenches, they were so rotten. No trenches at all in parts, just isolated mounds, found germans feet sticking up through the ground. The gurkhas had actually used human bodies instead of sandbags right beside the stream where we were working, where the bodies of two dead since november last one, face downward in full marching order with this kit on his back. He died game stench, something awful and dead all around water rats had made a home of their decomposed bodies visiting the barb wire with ray, ordinary wire strung across, quit about 1:00 AM, came back to our dugouts and found them on fire. Had to march out to st julien and put up in a roofless house, not a roof left on anything in the whole place. Found our sack of food had been stolen, and we were famished. Certainly a most unlucky day for I lost my cherished pipe bed at 4:00 AM and quote,

Speaker 5:          01:50:13       well, if the canadians thought the battlefield and the traditional aspects of what war had already come to be by that time were as bad as it was going to get. They were frightfully mistaken for at this battle. That will be called. The second battle of ipa is the first time that a major gas attack happens and the canadians will be the reason that it doesn't turn out to be a huge tragedy for the allied cause. The other reason will be that the germans had no idea that their attack was going to be this successful and this becomes a pattern with all this new technology. Very often the commanders are trying to figure out whether this new technology is going to be something that's effective and useful, so they try it out on a small scale, not really expecting to make good use of it and because of the sheer shock of the new stuff, it proves wonderfully effective, but it can't be exploited because the generals who authorized it's use hadn't planned to explore it. If they were hoping to test it out a little bit and then if it was good, they'll use it later, but by the time later Comes around, the other side has figured out countermeasurEs. Gas worked exactly like that. Then before it was used, the german high command, just as they did with submarine warfare, debated whether or not this was a good thing intensely.

Speaker 5:          01:51:33       As we said, there were all these laws that the hague conference had sat down saying you couldn't use this stuff, and some of the german leaders had said, we sign these papers, and others had found little loopholes like legal loopholes that said, well, it said we couldn't use shovels, but nothing said anything about just taking the lids off of, you know, containers that had chlorine gas in them.

Speaker 5:          01:51:56       Historian eric dorm burroughs writes, quote the same kind of murderously cold war time mentality that would terminate 1200 civilians aboard the lusitania two weeks later did not allow. However, for respect of international law, german legal experts advised general falcon hein, that the attack could be justified because the gas was released from containers. In fact, just to save artillery shells and not from projectiles. On the other side of the debate, duke albert avert and commander of the sixth army argued that unleashing this new weapon would not only be a moral but also with dubious military value. For the allies with the wind, normally at their backs would probably send 10 times as much gas onto german positions. Karl von item of the third army agreed and then additional worries over the quote, tremendous scandal and quote that would compromise in disgrace Germany in the eyes of the world.

Speaker 5:          01:52:53       War haS nothing to do with chivalry anymore. He wrote, the higher civilization rises, the more vile man becomes and quote, if anybody still had any of those old 19th century, truly going back to ancient times, versions of the romantic glorious, heroic dual that they had been raised to believe that war was operation. Disinfectant will cure them of such ills. That will be the german name for the program and the code word to start the operation will be god punish england. The operation involves almost 6,000 cylinders containing chlorine gas, a byproduct of the German dye manufacturing industry that the germans had planted in the soil carefully over time, around the battlefield that ether in August, 1915, they took the tops off the containers when the wind was right and let the chlorine gas blow across the battlefield toward the allied trenches. Which were occupied by french algerian forces which involve both french troops and Algeria and troops, and also the newly arrived canadian forces.

Speaker 5:          01:54:12       They didn't know what to make of this, but they figured out pretty quickly it was hell on earth as one indian soldier would write his father afterwards. This isn't war. This is the end of the world. The end of the world to some of these people at the second battle of ipa looked like a cloud of greenish yellow gas that was floating across the battlefield so slowly you could actually walk ahead of it, but because these soldiers didn't know what they were looking at, most of them didn't move until it hit them. Again. Historian eric dorn bros quote, stretching 6,000 meters along opposing lines and bellowing high up into the air. A thick, ghastly looking green. Yellow cloud of gas moved eerily and threateningly with the breeze across no man's land. The gassiest monstrosity took on a pinkish hue from certain angles. As the descending western sun shone through it.

Speaker 5:          01:55:11       To compound the shock and terror, german heavy artillery began to lay down a pounding barrage to french colonial divisions. And a canadian division were caught completely unaware. Quote, take a look at this. Sir said one canadian artillery observer to his superior as he stared through binoculars, it was coming towards them. There's something funny going on when he dove for cover from the incoming shells, but just then the wind shifted compressing the gas cloud over the algerian who's forward units were the soldiers grabbed their throats, choking and riding in excruciating pain from the searing chlorine gas in minutes. Many hundreds laid drowning in fluids given off by the lungs. Seeing this others panicked, drop their rifles and ran, leaving a six kilometer gap in the line and quote private william quintin, a british soldier experience his first gas attack only about a week after the first time it had been used. That affair had caused

Speaker 5:          01:56:17       the high command to tell the troops to soak flannel in water and just put it over their noses is a cheap, easy attempt to try to forestall the gas. But none of these soldiers knew what they were facing until they actually, you know, had a gas attack hit them. Which quintin had hit him on May 1st 19, 15 quote. Suddenly over the top of our front line, we saw what looked like clouds of thin gray smoke rolling slowly along with a slight wind. It hung, did the ground reaching to the height of eight or nine feet and approached so slowly that a man walking could have kept ahead of it. Gas the word quickly passed round even now, it had no terror for us, for we had not yet tasted it from our hammer stacks. We hastily drew the flannel belts, soak them in water, and tied them around our mouths and noses.

Speaker 5:          01:57:06       Suddenly through the communication trench came rushing. A few khaki clad figures, their eyes glaring out of their heads, their hands tearing at their throats as they came on, some stumbled and fell and lay writhing at the bottom of the trench. Choking and gasping will those following trampled over them. If ever men were raving mad with terror, these men were what was left of our section. Still crouched at the support end of the communication trench are frontline. Judging from the number of men who just come from, it had been abandoned and we now waited for the first rush of germans, but they did not come. Our biggest enemy was now within a few yards of us and in the form of a cloud of gas. We caught our first whiff of it. No words of mine can ever describe my feelings as we inhaled the first mouthful. We choked, spit and coughed.

Speaker 5:          01:57:55       My lungs felt as though they were being burnt out, that they were going to burst. Red hot needles were being thrust into my eyes. The first impulse Was to run. We had just seen men running to certain death and knew it rather than stay and be choked into a slow and agonizing death. It was one of those occasions when you do not know what you were doing. The men who stayed was no braver than the man who ran away. We crouched. They're terrified. Stupefied a large shell burst on the pair of pitt. Just where we were sheltered. We were almost buried beneath the falling earth. Young addington, a chap about my own age was screaming at the top of his voice and trying to free his buried legs. He got free and before we could stop him, he rushed off. God knows where we then saw the reason for his screams. His left was blown off above the elbow. He left a trail of blood over my tunic as he climbed over me in a mad rush to get away and to quote

Speaker 5:          01:58:51       quintin and his unit of canadians will block heroically in the hole that develops in the line keeping the germans from breaking through. Of course, the germans hadn't expected to break through. The entire reason for this gas attack was to experiment with the gas and to cover the fact that the germans were removing troops for use on the eastern front. The german high command had no idea it was going to be this successful and no one had any idea how horrifying it was going to be. Private. William quintin and his unit will move up to the front line and will experience the aftermath of what the gas attack did to the people who first encountered it. He wrote, quote black in the face, their tunics and shirt fronts torn open at the next, in their last desperate fight for breath. Many of them quite still while others were still wriggling and kicking in the agonies of the most awful death I've ever seen. Some were wounded in the bargain and they're gaping wounds. Lay open. Blood's still oozing from them. One poor devil was tearing at his throat with his hands. I doubt if he knew or felt that he had only one hand and that the other was just a stump where the hand should have been this stump. He worked around his throat as if his hand was still there and the blood from it was streaming over his bluish black face and neck. A few minutes later, he was still except for occasional shutters as he breathed his last and quote,

Speaker 5:          02:00:15       as I've said before in this program, and I think I will say many times more. This is the most horrifying sustained situation of terribleness I've ever seen soldiers forced to endure and millions and millions of people will get to experience this before the end of the conflict. My own grandfather would be gassed on the western front and he was never the same afterwards. The use of poison gas is a defining moment in this conflict, one that puts the final end stamp on the 19th century victorian romantic ideals of warfare. You can't pretend anymore when human beings are being treated. You know the way you would treat ants with a can of raid or some other insecticide even before gases used the times of london, the great paper in britain. In November, 1914, we'll run an article which seems amazing by modern standards, but of course we're in a post first and second world war era now. Those people were coming into this conflict with certain ideals and understandings of what war was going to be like and the trenches and the continual death for no apparent gain had shaken their whole view of what war was all about. November 19, 14, the times ran this piece quote,

Speaker 5:          02:01:42       all the spectacular side of the war has gone never to reappear trenches and always trenches and within range of the concealed guns in visibility. The supreme law, day after day, the butchery of the unknown by the unseen war has become stupid. The strain on the infantry is tremendous and it is endless at the cost of thousands of lives, a few hundred yards maybe gained, but rarely indeed does. Even the most brilliant attack produce anything fresh troops brought up under cover of a tremendous artillery fire, which opens up by surprise, may affect a breach, but only with heavy loss. Can such an attack be carried through and to quote that little rundown about how war has become stupid, now accurately describes what the entire year of 1915 on the western front will be like. Nobody's going to move at all and amazing numbers of people are going to die in efforts that gain nothing.

Speaker 5:          02:02:45       Now in the defense of the general sue, order these efforts to gain nothing. They have to figure out how to do things including experimentation to our minds. You would think you would stop after a while, but these people had to figure out how to win the war. I mean, they didn't even know, for example, how to get through the ever expanding fields of barbed wire that crop up between the two enemy trench lines. You have to have battles to simply see what kind of artillery blows up enough of the wire to create a path for your troops to attack through. This is lessons being learned at an incredible cost, but there's really no other way to do it.

Speaker 5:          02:03:27       It's fascinating to look at pictures already in 1915, six to eight months after the war has started and see how this period has become sort of an estuary between the 19th and the 20th century where you see the combination of the two centuries blending. I mean when the war starts, you have cavalry that is indistinguishable from napoleon's queer sears going off to war with gleaming breastplates and horse herrick helmets and sabers and spurs and white gloves, and now you have gas and soon you're going to have, you know, german cavalry lancers. For example. As soon as 1916 rolls around, they start having the same helmet that the germans would use in the second world war, the stall helm, and you have know cavalry with lances and install helm and a gas mask, and it's the perfect example of the two arrows blending in sort of like I said, a historical estuary. You go from that napoleonic feeling of war with french soldiers going off into the conflict with bright red pants. You know, in six to eight months later, we have gas, we have flame throwers, we have hundreds of guns, a time firing on battlefields. We have trenches, barbed wire, snipers everywhere. This is not what anybody thought was going to happen and it begins to unhinge a lot of people, which is something that is new to the human experience, at least as far as the modern european armies are concerned.

Speaker 5:          02:05:02       People begin to go insane

Speaker 5:          02:05:04       to lose their mind, to have their nerves shattered, and this is something, as I said, no, this war does something that seems unbelievable. The ability to take one of the most stressful situations human beings ever find themselves in and make it worse because all war is psychologically challenging, isn't it? What made the first world war more difficult than almost any other major conflict you can think of is not just the changes in warfare, although that's significant, but how long the soldiers were forced to deal with it. I mean take one of the worst battles in human history to be a soldier in the famous second punic war battle of kony, right where hannibal and his carthaginians famously surround maybe 80,000 romans and then spend the entire afternoon. No slaughtering them by hand, cutting their way into the center of this crowd of doomed men who have to wait all day in the most unbelievably just orienting environment you can think of.

Speaker 5:          02:06:10       They can't hear anything. They can't see anything. There's dust everywhere, but they know what's coming and were told by the ancient writers. That's so terrible that when the carthaginians cut their way into the center of this massive doomed men, they will find that some roman soldiers packed so tightly that they couldn't even raise their hands in this crowd of people just sunk to their knees, dug a little hole with their hands, put their head in the hole and covered it up, committing suicide because either they had lost their minds or they'd come to the conclusion, why wait for the inevitable that's supposed to show you how terrible the situation is in the first world war. You begin to see very quickly people who are unhinged,

Speaker 5:          02:06:56       these soldiers trapped at the battle of [inaudible]. we're having a historic bad day, but it was one day a week or two before that battle. They were in relatively little danger if they survived a week or two after that battle, same thing. The soldiers in the great war had no such luxury. They had to deal with these circumstances day after day after day and after this war. Military psychologist looking into the phenomenon of what will later be known as shell shock will determine that under the conditions these soldiers were fighting in. It doesn't matter how brave you were. Eventually, you know, we each had a different threshold we could stand, but eventually anyone would lose their mind.

Speaker 5:          02:07:42       Think about what's involved and you begin to understand why. First take the shelling itself, which is something that is really impossible for any of us to understand. There are very few people living that have ever been through the kinds of shelling that these world war one soldiers routinely had to deal with and it's very hard to describe one of the traditional kinds of shelling in that war was something that came to be known as drum fire. Drum fire is so named because it sounds like a drum roll. And instead of, you know, just hearing the drum being tapped at that speed, each one of those things represent a shell going off. That's how quickly the shells are landing.

Speaker 5:          02:08:24       Ernst, younger who we've quoted, uh, the author of the storm of steel, one of the most unusual soldiers by the way in the first world war because he kind of liked the war and he kind of saw positive benefits to it, you know, so sort of the uplifting side of war. And he was about as brave as any soldier you will ever find lost his composure under artillery fire. He explains a situation where he comes under fire and just loses his mind temporarily. You know this again, one of the strongest people mentally in the first world war that we know about and younger says, quote,

Speaker 5:          02:09:01       we fell out and extended order and lay down expectantly and a series of flattish depressions that some predecessors of ours had scooped out of the ground are rebelde. Conversations were suddenly cut off by a marrow freezing cry 20 yards behind us, clumps of earth, world up out of a white cloud and smacked into the bows. The crash echoed through the woods stricken eyes, looked at each other. Bodies pressed themselves into the ground with a humbling sensation of powerlessness to do anything else. Explosion followed explosion choking gases drifted over, the undergrowth, smoke obscured the tree tops, trees and branches came crashing to the ground, screams. We leapt up and ran blindly, chased by lightnings and crushing air pressure from tree to tree, looking for cover, skirting around giant tree trunks like frightened game, a dugout where many men had taken shelter and which I too was running towards, took a direct hit that ripped up the planking and sent heavy timber spinning through the air like a couple of squirrels having stones thrown at them.

Speaker 5:          02:10:04       The nco and I dodged panting around a huge beach tree quite mechanically and spurred on by further explosions. I ran after my superior who sometimes turn round and stared at me wild. I yelling, what in god's name are those things? What are they? Suddenly there was a flash among the route work and a below on the left thigh flung me to the ground. I thought I had been struck by a clump of earth, but the warm trickle of blood indicated that I had been wounded. Later I saw that a needle sharp piece of had given me a flesh wound. Don't my wallet had taken the brunt of it, the fine cut, which before slicing into the muscle had split. No fewer than nine thicknesses of stout leather looked as though it might've been administered by a scalpel. He continues. I threw down my haversack and ran toward the trench we had come from, from all sides, wounded men were making tracks towards it from the shelled woods.

Speaker 5:          02:10:57       The trench was appalling, choked with seriously wounded and dying. Men of figure stripped to the waist with a ripped open back, leaned against the parapet another with a triangular flap hanging off the back of his skull emitted short high pitched screams. This was the home of the great god pain, and for the first time I looked through a devilish chink into the depths of his realm and fresh shells came down all the time. I lost my head completely. Ruthlessly. I barged past every one on my path before finally having fallen back a few times in my haste, climbing out of the hellish crush of the trench to move more freely above like a bolting horse. I rushed through the dense undergrowth across paths and clearings. To I collapse in the cops by the grand trine, she and quote this one of the most suicidal, he brave soldiers of the great war. If it can happen to him, it could happen to anyone and I am constantly amazed at the immense bravery and an almost carelessness of death that our grandparents and great grandparents showed consistently in this conflict and I always wonder about how I do or my generation would do in the same situation.

Speaker 5:          02:12:15       Younger tries later on to explain what the feeling of being in an artillery barrage is like. And it's difficult because we have nothing to compare it to. have you ever been on an airplane, for example, with when it's in heavy turbulence and it takes one of those horrible drops in your stomach? Just sort of. I mean there's. I can't even describe that feeling and that's nothing younger. Writes this in one of the greatest descriptions I've ever heard of what it feels like and he was trying to explain it to people who've never experienced it. He wrote this quote. It's an easier manner to describe these sounds than to endure them because one cannot put associate every single sound of flying steel with the idea of death, and so I huddled in my hole in the ground with my hand in front of my face, imagining all the possible variants of being hit. I think I found a comparison that captures the situation in which I and all the other soldiers who took part in this war so often found ourselves. You musT imagine that you were securely tied to a post beinG menaced by a man swinging a heavy hammer. Now the hammer has been taken back over his head, ready to be swung. Now it's cleaving the air towards you on the point of touching your skull. Then it struck the post and the splinters flying. That's what it's like to experience heavy shelling in an exposed position and quote.

Speaker 5:          02:13:40       Now when you can take cover in the trench and press yourself up against the earth and dig your head into the soil and try to just weather the storm, that's hard enough, but there are a lot of times in this conflict. A lot of times when your job is to run through the drum, fire in the hail of shells, to do everything your body tells you not to do. If orange younger can get carried away by the shell fire, you know what hope do regular role joe's like yours truly have right yulia scotch and is in one of those situations that soldiers all through the war will be in. When you know some officer blows a whistle and says, time to jump out of the trench and run past the gunfire, and he writes the feeling you have when it's your turn. We had approached the firing line a little more than two miles when we got within reach of the enemy's curtain of fire.

Speaker 5:          02:14:35       A terrific hail of shells was plowing up every foot of ground. Thousands of corpses of german soldiers were witnesses to the immense loss as the germans had suffered in bringing up all available reserves. the french tried their utmost to prevent the germans from bringing in their reserves and increased their artillery fire to an unheard of violence. It seemed impossible for us to break through that barricade of fire. Hundreds of shells were bursting every minute. We were ordered to pass that hell singly and that a running pace. We were lying on the ground and observed how the first of our men tried to get through. some ran forward like mad, not heating. The shells that were bursting around them and got through. Others were entirely buried by the dirt, dug up by the shells or were torn to pieces by shell splinters. Two men had scarcely reached the line when they were struck by a bullseye.

Speaker 5:          02:15:27       I eat the heavy shell, exploded at their feet, leaving nothing of them who can imagine what we were feeling during these harrowing minutes as we lay crouching on the ground, not quite a hundred feet away, seeing everything and only waiting for our turn to come. One had entangled oneself and amaze of thoughts. Suddenly one of the officers Would cry. The next one that was I just as if roused out of a bad dream, I jumped up and race away like mad, holding the rifle in my right hand and the bayonet in my left eye. Jump aside a few steps in front of to bursting shells and running into two others which are bursting at the same time. I leapt back several times, run forward again, race about wildly to find a gap through which to escape, but fire an iron everywhere like a hunted beast. One, seek some opening To save oneself. hell is in front of me and behind me. The officers revolver kept ready to shoot the lumps of steel, fall down like a heavy shower from high above hell and damnation. I blindly run and run and run until someone gets me by my coat. Where there someone roars into my ear, stopped. Are you wounded? Have a look. Perhaps you are and you don't know it. Here I am trembling all over. Sit down. The other person says, you will feel better. We trembled too.

Speaker 5:          02:16:44       End quote.

Speaker 5:          02:16:47       How many of us could do that and think about the mentality and how these people were raised, you know, and what was involved that allowed them to do this. I mean, I have a feeling that my generation would just turn around at the office or holding a gun to wash to get us to do that and figure that guy can't take us all out. We're not going into that. We did a history show once about the question of whether the older generation raised in a different time. We're tougher than we were, and of course there's no way to really come to any conclusions about that, but when you read this and you see what our grandparents and great grandparents did, it boggles the mind and if those shells will drive you insane, the carnage that they create that you have to live around every day just may.

Speaker 5:          02:17:36       As I said, one of the terrible things about this battle that's different from most of the second world war is in the second world war. you have what's called the moving front. When dire in his famous piece war talked about the continuous front, as he calls it, the first world war initiated in the second world war. The continuous front moves, right? You have blitzkrieg and the people are continually changing locations. What makes the battlefields of the first world war, as we said earlier, so particularly horrifying, is that it doesn't change location. You get to live around the carnage from years past, even in the second world war eugene sledge riding, you know from the us marines talking about fighting in the pacific. We'll talk about his particularly horrified feeling as he watched flies that were feeding on dead bodies right near him, fly right to the edge of his coffee cup and land in his coffee. these are the little horrifying things that you would think after a while will just drive you out of your mind. Phillip gibbs and his absolutely groundbreaking work now it can be told was a journalist on the scene, as we said earlier, and unable to write about the reality of the war until afterwards. He describes one of these situations and just how incredible it was to have to live in this. It's worse than the charnel house.

Speaker 5:          02:19:00       He describes an area called a huge that was so terrible near the battlefield and he says, quote, the worst school of war for the sons of gentleman was in those days and for long afterwards huge. This was the devil's playground and his chamber of horrors wherein he devised mary tortures for young christian men. It waS not far out of [inaudible] to the left of the men and road and to the of is wildwood and sanctuary would for a time. There was a chateau. They're called the white shadow with excellent stables and good accommodation for one of our brigades staffs until one of our generals was killed and others wounded by a shell which broke up their conference. Afterwards. There was no shadow but only a rubble of bricks banked up with sandbags and deep mind craters filled with stinking water slopping over from the belvoir data lake and low lying pools.

Speaker 5:          02:19:55       Bodies and bits of bodies and clots of blood and green. Metallic looking. Slime made by explosive gases were floating on the surface of that water below the crater banks when I first passed that way, and so it was always our men live there and died there within a few yards of the enemy crouched below the sand bags and pasted into the mud banks. If they dug to get deeper, cover their shovels went into the softness of dead bodies who had been their comrades. Scraps of flesh, booted legs, blackened hands, eilis heads came falling over them. When the enemy trench more in their position or blew up a new mineshaft end quote,

Speaker 5:          02:20:37       how would that not drive anybody crazy? That is war made worse. That's you living in zombie land and being shelled at the same time. It's. It is, As I said many times and will continue to say, this is the worst experience for soldiers in warfare I've ever seen on a mass scale, even in stalin grodd and the second world war, widely considered one of the worst places to be in the world. That just equals the experience that many men on the western front got to experience routinely. How did they deal with it in ways that are some sort of a wonderful testament to human nature? They often joked about it. They adopted a sort of gallows humor at times that reminds you of police officers or firemen or let's be honest, journalists and soldiers and people who see this horrible stuff and their way of coping with it. His humor,

Speaker 5:          02:21:41       the journalist Philip Gibbs experienced this and took part in it, and this was his theory on the whole thing. It was astonishing how loudly one laugh to tales of gruesome things of wars brutality I with the rest of them. I think at the bottom of it was a sense of the ironical contrast between the normal ways of civilian life and this hark back to the cave man code. it made all of our old philosophy of life monstrously ridiculous. It played the hat trick with the gentility of modern manners. Men who had been brought up to christian virtues who would prattle dear little prayers at their mother's knees who had grown up to love poetry, painting music, the gentle arts over sensitized to the subtleties of halftones delicate scales of emotion. Fastidious in their choice of words, in their sense of beauty found themselves compelled to live and act like eight men and it was a bottom bubbly funny. They laughed at the most frightful episodes which revealed this contrast between civilized ethics and the old beast law. The more revolting it was, the more sometimes they shouted with laughter, especially in reminiscence, when the tail was told of the gilded sAlon of the french chateau or at the table,

Speaker 5:          02:23:02       it was I think he writes the Laughter of mortals at the trick which had been played on them by an ironical fate. They had been taught to belIeve that the whole object of life was to reach out to beauty and love and that mankind in its progress to perfection had killed the beast instinct, cruelty, blood, lust, the primitive savage laws of survival by tooth and claw and club and acts, all poetry, all art. All religion had preached this gospel in this promise. Now that ideal had broken like a China vase dash to hard ground. The contrast between that, and this was devastating, and to quote the stories that they told were both funny and revealing in a horrified way, like the gallows humor you see from police officers and soldiers and whatnot. OnE of the ones is this one quote in one section of trenches, the men made a habit of bedding upon those who would be wounded. First. It had all the uncertainty of the roulette table. One day when the german gunners were putting over a special dose of hate, a sergeant kept coming to one dugout to inquire about a quote end quote, new chum who had come up with the drafts is private smith. All right, he asked, yes, sergeant, he's all right, answered the men crouching in the dark hole. Private. Smith isn't wounded yet. Asked the sergeant again. Five minutes later, no sergeant

Speaker 5:          02:24:31       private smith was touched by this interest in his wellbeing and said, that sergeant seems a very kind man, said, the boy seems to love me like a father. A yell of laughter answered him. You pour bleediNg. Fools said one of his comrades, he's drawn you in a lottery. Stood dwayne, if you'd been hit, and another example of this amazing ability of human beings to adapt in these kinds of situations with the tools given to us, including humor, which again you, you, you look at survivors of auschwitz and treblinka and the death camps of the nazis. The jews were using humor even there to cope. Gibbs tells this story quote

Speaker 5:          02:25:16       in digging new trenches in new dugouts. Bodies and bits of bodies were on earth and put into sand bags with the soil that was sent back down the line of men concealing their work from german eyes waiting for any new activity in our ditches. Bit of bill said, the leading man putting in the leg. Another bit of bill, he said, unearthing a hand bills, ugly mug. He said at a later stage in the operation when a head was found, gibbs says, quote, as told afterwards, that little episode in the trenches seemed immensely. Comic generals chuckled over it. Chaplains treasured it and quote all the coping mechanisms in the world. Though we're not enough to help. You know when things got to a really critical stage, every human being has a breaking point as we said, and what in the first world war was called shell shock.

Speaker 5:          02:26:10       We mentioned it earlier, would later be updated to battle fatigue as soon as the experts realized it was an imprecise term because you didn't have to be exposed to artillery shells at all to get it. Now we would call It post traumatic stress disorder. You see it in soldiers today. It's pretty common now. I'm not just not a historian. I'm not a psychologist either, so take this with a grain of salt, but this is something that appears to be what they call a spectrum disorder, meaning you can have a severity scale like one to 10, and not to minimize anything our current veterans go through, but they'll often come back from these wars, you know, with nightmares or an inability to sleep or eat properly or to reintegrate into society and they've obviously suffered some trauma and damage. In the first world war though, those people would often be shot if you couldn't see visible evidence.

Speaker 5:          02:27:05       And oftentimes, even if you could, the people in that era, especially early in the war, didn't look at this as some sort of a legitimate problem. To them, this was just another manifestation of cowardice, punishable by death. Take for example, Philip Gibbs, his account, and he has a bunch of them because this was one of the things that upset him the most. He would go to the front report on what the soldiers had to endure and then once they were damaged by what they had to endure, report on how the completely clueless militaries of the day, you know, then punish them again for something they were already victimized once for he tells one story, for example, of an officer that he's meeting with who comes back to the meeting with him from a court marshal hearing. He'd just been to where they had sentenced one of these people who had had his mind blown by his experience to death.

Speaker 5:          02:28:02       He says, quote, going up to kemo one day I had to wait in battalion headquarters for the officer. I'd gone to see he was attending a court marshal. Presently. He came into the wooden hut with a flushed face. Sorry, I had to keep you. He said, tomorrow there will be one swine less in the world, a death sentence. Gabe said. He nodded a damned coward, said he didn't mind rifle, fire, but couldn't stand shells. Admitted he left his post. He doesn't mind rifle. Fire. Well, tomorrow morning, the officer laughed, grimley and then listened for a second. There were some heavy crumps fallen over campbell hill rather close. It seemed to our wooden hut. He's talking about artillery shells falling nearby, by the way. Damn those german gunners said, the officer, why can't they give us a little piece? he turned to his papers, but several times while I talked with him, he jerked his head up and listen to a heavy crash.

Speaker 5:          02:28:55       On the way back, I saw a man on foot walking in front of a mountain man past the old hill, loved the shepherd berg. Toward the village of luck. There was something in the way he walked in, his attitude, the head hunched forward a little and his arms behind his back, which made me turn to look at him. He was manacled and tied by a rope to the mountain man. I caught one glimpse of his face and then turned away cold and sick. There was doom written on his face and in his eyes, a captured look. He was walking to his wall and quote, meaning the wall where he was going to be put up against and shocked by his compatriots. Gibbs later quotes another general saying that anyone who comes down with these symptoms as a damn coward and he'd have them all shot now early in the war.

Speaker 5:          02:29:42       This is how they thought because they didn't deal with this routinely. There had been a little talk of this during the so japanese war, a decade before this, where the russians were encountering this kind of a problem, but this was a new experience. This idea of combat fatigue, battle fatigue, shell shocked. This would be stuff by the way, that all the major militaries of the world would study after the first world war and they would incorporate what they learned into training procedures and how you dealt with combat in the next war to try to minimize these problems. Even later in the first world war, the generals would learn that you need to rotate your troops away from the front lines, you know, at regular intervals, you can't leave them up there indefinitely or they're all going to go crazy, so you'll see these times where for a week or two, the troops will have to live in the mud in three feet of standing water under shell fire, you know, all the time, but then they'll take them to the back, to the rear areas that are safer and then let them recover and then slowly move them back toward the front.

Speaker 5:          02:30:43       This rotation was intended to keep them fresh and keep them from becoming psychological casualties and you know, these are people who are foaming at the mouth sometimes when they are brought back from the lines. These aren't people who are saying, I just can't handle it any more general. Although sometimes that's what you encounter. These are people whose limbs have turned to rigor mortis or who are so palsy. They can't walk For the epileptic seizures or seizure like things you're seeing. You can actually go sEe this by the way, because after the war, many of these people didn't heal. They never healed. Forty years later, they're still taking up hospital

Speaker 1:          02:31:20       space in some of these countries and there are films that the doctors made showing you these people's symptoms and they're online. You can view them.

Speaker 1:          02:31:28       Some of these symptoms are so physical in nature that this is kind of how the term shell shock first became fashionable because there were theories that maybe the concussion and the change in air pressure that the shells nearby, you know, exploding actually did brain damage or nerve damage to these people because when you actually see some of these cases and how they're affected, that looks like physical damage. It doesn't look like mental damage, but again, that did not prevent the militaries from treating this as cowardice, especially early on and dishing out the capital punishment penalty for it.

Speaker 1:          02:32:07       That having been said, it's still fascinating to me how few actually had to be executed for this stuff. Sometimes you can read books where the british hurt themselves in the 19 seventies. I have a book from the 19 seventies and, and it's just this outbreak, you know, and you look in and 330 people or executed or something for uh, you know, running away in combat, abandoning your post desertion, those kinds of things. And I think to myself, I think my generation, if we were forced to go through what those people had to go through, that's how many people they'd shoot in a month

Speaker 1:          02:32:40       because what's happening in 1915 and you can sum up the entire western front in 1915, you don't have to deal with any of the battles is that the situation is, is degenerating into what we understand. The first reward would be like on the western front trenches and defenses that are becoming evermore sophisticated. We are now getting beyond the era where we are talking about, you know, one long trench on one side and one long trench on the other and maybe a little bit of sophistication here and there, but you know, it's a little barbed wire between and we're entering into a phase now we're on the western front. You begin to have to fortifications and you're not talking now about successful attacks going after people. You're trying to batter down defenses that go sometimes miles backwards. Historian eric dorm bros describes these deepening 1915 fortifications like this

Speaker 6:          02:33:38       Quote.

Speaker 1:          02:33:39       When the Allies attacked in may 19, 15, the trenches were shielded by two belts of barbed wire each five feet high and 30 meters deep behind the wire lay a trench network consisting of three lines, 100 meters apart at regular intervals. Each tranche had a zigzag or dog leg traverse to shield defenders from shells landing nearby and prevent attackers from firing machine guns down the entire length of the trench. This network of trenches were supported 1000 meters back by concrete machine gun pill boxes to mow down enemies. Soldiers who pierced the forward positions,

Speaker 6:          02:34:17       those

Speaker 1:          02:34:18       already formidable sounding defenses were increased during the summer. Burrows continues quote during the summer, a second double belt of barbed wire went into place 1000 meters. Behind the rear. Pillbox is of the first trench system. Then came a second triple line of trenches, also backed by machine gun emplacements. The defenders also burrowed ever more deeply into the ground to make the system work optimally. Monthly outputs of machine guns had increased nearly 12 fold. Both the first and second trench systems were linked by communication trenches for moving up. Reinforcements are retreating underground. Telephone cables connected the first line with the second as well as with the artillery far to the rear general falcon hinds, well-designed kilometers deep double killing zones amounted to a massive engineering and construction project, but it was carried out before the allies attacked again in september and to quote that's attacking a fortress now, the allies were also deepening and making their trenches more sophisticated, but not to the same degree the germans were because the allies attitude is why would we waste that much effort when we're hoping the next attack or the next attack breaks us through.

Speaker 1:          02:35:30       We be out of these trenches, will be in their trenches. The germans have a much more defensive attitude on the western front at this time. They plan on staying a while. They dig deeper into the earth and build these bunk houses with timber overhead. You know, big trees laid down. Log cabin style with earth on top of that. Sometimes they have carpeting on the floor, wallpaper on the walls, shelving. I mean it's in some ways a giant, you know, roman empire, kind of hadrian's wall up and down the line, many belts deep. These are insane fortifications. Who in their right mind would think you want to slam human beings up against that over and over again. Well, french and british military leadership on the continent. That's who francis military leaders also. Jennifer has an attitude of just get them out there on the sacred soil to France.

Speaker 1:          02:36:24       It's also important resource and industrial territory. You know, jennifer will waste if necessary and entire generation of young frenchman to eject the honey from francis soil, the hun being one of those propaganda stake names for the germans and the british commander of british forces in France. Confusingly, unironically named as we said before, sir John French agrees with jennifer. Just give us more troops. Were the bigger boxer in this prize fight and who cares if we hit their elbows and their wrists and their bones? They're going down eventually, just give us more troops who will pound these fortifications down, and the way they did this, by the way, was with more guns. Nineteen 15 is not just the beginning of the heavy duty trench warfare, it's the beginning of the attempts to deal with the heavy duty trench warfare and you'd do this with ever increasing amounts of guns, have bigger caliber and using them for longer periods of time in just one of these sort of double headed battles that will be fought in the middle of the 1915 sir John French figures out a way to break through these kinds of fortifications is with many, many hours of many, many guns shooting in a confined area.

Speaker 1:          02:37:36       He stockpiles piles. Five point 2 million shells for use in this one. Double-headed defensive, so you're going to pound these fortifications and then you're going to send men into the gap to occupy them. That's what a french general battan said that artillery conquers the ground and you send the men in afterwards to occupy it. That's the 1915 strategy. It's also called by some commanders bite and hold. Some of these generals ideas was, you know, you're grabbing area, you grab it with artillery, you take it over with people when all the other side's killed by the artillery, and then you start fortifying it. You turn that into your little castle and now you've just moved your sides, fortifications more toward their side. It's a giant moving war of trenches and siege fortifications, and when one side takes a new area, the other side goes and attacks them right away before they can fortify it again.

Speaker 1:          02:38:27       It makes it impossible to follow these battles, but that's what 1915 looks like evermore big guns ever more wasted opportunities, evermore futility and the most forward thinkers amongst the allied leaders and decision makers are looking at this already at the end of 1914 and they can see it in the distance and they're thinking to themselves, must we go there? A french thinker as supposed to have floated the idea first, but it was picked up most famously by winston churchill and idea of finding a flank in another fighting theater. Why do we have to throw more troops into the meat grinder? The british empire is just starting to produce a decent number of people. They've got some building up of troops happening. These volunteers that first joined up at the very beginning of the war are now gone through their training period. They're not going to be thrown in early like general falcon hind did with those poor students, soldiers they're going to be husband did for just the right time.

Speaker 1:          02:39:25       They're green, but they're trained. Must we throw these precious, you know, troops into the meat grinder. More empire troops by the way, are also showing up. The canadians, as we said, and indians are already there, but other troops really from dominions, I think we said commonwealth earlier and although the term was used, it's not officially the right term until between the two wars, when commonwealth status is granted to some of these places. Um, let's just call them dominions. Troops from New Zealand and Australia raised up again in, in patriotic fervor for the cause and large numbers of people relative to the total population of these places. They're on the way. Are you really going to sacrifice all these troops into attacking these deep fortifications? Well, for the commanders on the western front, french and british who were were of

Speaker 5:          02:40:14       the opinion that every person should be thrown into the western front. They would argue that it's only a meat grinder on the western front because we don't have enough men yet to overrun that meat grinder and you give us enough people will will end this war fast and a lot less people will die.

Speaker 5:          02:40:30       There was, as I mentioned earlier, a kind of cabal of thinkers who had come to the conclusion that that sort of thinking was mistaken and that surely there are better ideas out there than to throw, you know, more and more human beings into the teeth of the enemy's defenses. That cabal had some famous members in it. Winston churchill, for example, maybe the most famous, although lord horacio kitchener, the war minister not far behind, and these people were of the opinion, I guess you could compare it to a sort of a predatory idea. They had been trying to take down the nastiest animal in the herd for months now and they'd gotten gord in the process. The germans had done damage to every major member of the ally is by this time and there were the great lions of France and britain and Russia looking around and thinking to themselves, well, why don't we just follow the traditional predatory sort of approach and go after the weak and the sick and the old instead of going after the strong and young and dangerous, and there was a country in the war now that met all three of those key classifications as a guy like churchill would have made them country that was old and sick and weak.

Speaker 5:          02:41:53       There's more than a country was an empire, was a dying empire. I've been calling a Turkey throughout this whole show because that's the proper name for it in the first world war, but there's another proper name to that conjures up a whole different set of images than the perhaps modern sounding name of Turkey and that's the ottoman empire

Speaker 5:          02:42:15       and that conjures up images of sultan and janissaries and harem and being on the gates of vienna, almost overrunning into central europe. At one point. At the height of their history of knocking down the walls. of constantinople, formerly known as byzantium to the greeks, constantinople to the romans, and then after the salton, you know, got through that historic barrier and conquered the city. He renamed it is stem bowl as sort of a momento and giant monument for what his ottomans had achieved. That was when the ottomans were young and the ottomans were old now and they were losing territory over the decades like nobody's business. They were seen as a carcass to be picked at, as we said, the sick man of europe. They were called and someone like churchill looked at Turkey just sitting there. They come into the war in november, several months after the war officially starts and they're surrounded by water and they're maybe not even a second rate power.

Speaker 5:          02:43:26       They have the territory of a big second rate power. Lots of places trying to get out of Turkey but still stuck in Turkey. That's how an read might look at it or occurred. My look at it or an armenian might look at it nonetheless without the means to sort of protect all that territory. And then one of their main reasons there had been a war called the crimean war in the middle of the 19th century is because Turkey was so weak and yet so filled with territory you could take that the british and the french had to get involved to keep the russians from snapping up too much of it. So this appeared to be the easy animal in the herd to take down and a crucial place that might have all sorts of impact on the war. If you did take him down, take for example, all the countries that hadn't decided whose side they were going to fight on.

Speaker 5:          02:44:13       Yet when Turkey enters the war, as we said, it's a bit of a headache for the allies because they opened up an entire new theater of operations. Really. There might've been a little stuff on the side going on, but when Turkey gets into the warren, november 19, 14, the middle east is now in play. India may be in place. Southern russia's imply north africa and Egypt in play. The balkans is in play. the balkans is territory that when the ottoman turks were young and powerful, they owned, they had fought two wars in the past couple of years with the former territories that they used to own and watch them, you know, shake off the ottoman empire, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, all these places had been pulling themselves away from autumn and influence for some time now and none of them had decided which side they were gonna fight on in this war yet.

Speaker 5:          02:45:06       And It's fascinating. I mean you talk about watching open diplomacy in a way that's like watching horse trading going on is watching the allies on one side and the central powers on the other side try to convince a country to go their way. I mean with Italy for example, it's almost open auction time. I mean one alliance will walk in the front door and say, well, if we win the war and you're joining us, you can have this province from the enemy in that province, in that province do. And then you know, they'll leave. And then the other door comes. The other alliance system saying, is that all they promised you? Well, if we could have this, that and the other thing, and this was going on with all these countries in the balkans, Greece, for example, in the aegean, the number two thing they were all concerned with is what were they going to get? They got in the war. What are you promising me and you know, going to the highest bidder, but the number one thing they were all concerned with his who was gonna win. These countries knew that they were absolutely like roadkill if they pick the wrong side, but in early 1915, no clearcut dominant side had emerged and so churchill and his compatriots had this idea

Speaker 1:          02:46:10       that they could strike a big blow in that theater right in that part of the world. Even if they did knock anybody out with it, it might convince a lot of these powers. While you can see britain's gonna, when France is going to win, let's join them. Right? Changed the course of the war that way. So all these good arguments like this are starting to accrue for this cabal of people like winston churchill. When all of a sudden something intervenes to bring the whole thing to ahead, put it on the front burner and make the government consider whether or not it's a good idea. It's one thing to have a good idea. It's another thing to really be thinking about, okay, is this What we do? And a request from the russians changes this from a theoretical question to one that they're debating. In early january of 1915, the russians are asking for help.

Speaker 1:          02:46:53       they are facing the turks down near there, you know, border the church and the russian territory, touch but far away from where russian forces are fighting the germans and the austra hungarians because of the distance, the russians had pretty much taken their troops and they're fighting for their lives against the germans and use them up north and now the turks are attacking and strength down south. The situation will get critical. In late december, went on December 29th, the turkish forces up against the russians on their mutual border, start the battle of sarah calmness and try to attack the russian defenders from multiple sides at once. It's a very optimistic, very napoleonic in concept plan led by a civilian strategist actually who will take $120,000 on a good turkish army and ruin it. I'm in this battle because these russians, a smaller force than the turks attacking them are ensconced in the natural fortress that is the caucasus mountain range. In the middle of winter,

Speaker 1:          02:48:01       all this fighting is going to happen at elevations between 5,000 feet and 6,500 feet. Turkish soldiers are going to be fighting as though they're dressed for the low lands. The logistics of this hundred and 20,000 man army are going to be carried up into these mountains on tiny little windy mountain roads and there's not even many of them and it's snowing like you can't believe. We're told, have you know, multiple days of 14 our marches through, you know, waist deep snow. By the time these poor turkish troops get to the russians there darn near defeated. Then some of them surrender right away. May several cores just surrender that you and you just get this image of these starving, you know, units that are just falling apart. And at the end of their rope, some fight bravely and almost fanatically anyway. And then the next part of the story that's famous is the retreat of this turkish army back to Turkey.

Speaker 1:          02:48:53       They lose about half their strength. We're told that of the people that do make it back to Turkey, a third of them are so badly wounded that they'll have some part of their body amputated and the stories themselves and it's amazing alike. They are booked a book, but they they. They create this sort of mental image of like napoleon retreating from moscow in the winter. Harry did the whole way back with these soldiers that were freezing on the march because it was so cold and the mountain passes in the middle of winter and the army is supposed to be followed by packs of wolves through these, you know, almost bram stoker ish, like terrain and taking the frozen soldiers as they freeze or as they become too wounded to defend themselves. It's a horrifying story. And the turks will be very bitter and affected by this battle. The russians will be though too, because even though they technically when it, for all they know, the turks could do this in another three weeks or another month and they're not ready for this. Again, the turkish attack down here prove that this is not a quiet safe front and you better be ready for more. They're not ready for more. This is why they asked for help

Speaker 1:          02:50:04       and they asked for some diversion to be made that will draw some of these turkish troops away from them and maybe something that will open up the supply lines again beCause the turks control one of the most strategically important spots, not just in the world, but in world history. When you take constantinople in the 15th century, like the turks did, the dardanelles come with it. The dardanelles are the actual separation and this is a geographic feature that goes back to forever between asia and europe. If you look at it on satellite images, it looks like a rather large, um, river, but it really is only a mile apart in some spots. And this is the waterway that takes you from, you know, the g and c, which is connected to the mediterranean sea, which is connected to the rest of the world and get you from there to the black sea, which is not connected to the rest of the world unless you're using the dardanelles.

Speaker 1:          02:51:06       It's a straight of extreme importance and the turks control it. They have fortresses on both sides of this glorified river with canon. they've got mines in the waterway to prevent people from getting through that they don't want to get through. And once they get in the War in november, 19, 14, they don't want the russians to get through and they don't want the british to get through and the french to get through. And this is a huge problem for Russia because they don't have a lot of places. You know, where people can trade with them via the ocean. Especially, you know, if it's anywhere near the winter months, if it's near the winter months, you need this port open, the black sea port open and now the turks have closed it. The russians are in such bad straights. They are sending soldiers into battle with a rifle and then another soldier whose job it is to shadow the first soldier and when the first soldier dies, pick up his rifle and use it because the second person didn't get a rifle. The russian industry keep up with the military needs and so they're having problems like that so you can see how important it is for them to be able to trade with britain and France and maybe outside powers if just to get rifles to arm their troops with and now the turks have closed off that important area and winston churchill thinks he can open it.

Speaker 1:          02:52:23       He gets an idea that will involve any ground troops at all. He continually points this out in his book. By the way, we've used this book for this show, but not as a history book because it's not the kind of book you want to use to find historical truth. It's the kind of book you want to look to find the truth. As churchill saw it, unjustified it afterwards, which is a very different thing. Churchill, his fingerprints are all over this thing and this thing is going to go south fast, and so in churchill's book he does with almost any other person with any responsibility for world war one does in their post war memoirs, he defends himself, answers his critics, justifies this, explains that, and um, be no different than the german generals and whatnot in that respect. But his point is when he thought of this idea it didn't involve any land troops, and since land troops are going to be a huge part of the tragedy that this unfolds into, he basically says he washed his hands of the whole plan. Once that situation changed, churchill's plan was to take the largest, most powerful fleet ever assembled in world history and forced the streets

Speaker 1:          02:53:31       simply sail through him, wiping out any fort, you know, that's anywhere nearby with naval gunfire and go from one side to the other. And then once you're on the other side, you're right next to formerly constantinople. Now istanbul, and you have a giant megalopolis underneath the guns of the greatest fleet ever assembled and sent to war. It's an idea that looks great on paper

Speaker 1:          02:53:58       and then by the time events go from a all the way through the alphabet to z, though you see who rules the alphabet between a to z when it comes to getting something from the theoretical stage to the reality stage and that's murphy's law and murphy's law grabs hold of these events and Quickly turns this whole affair into something that no one had ever thought was the right thing to do. Shows you how people can get swamped by events sometimes and churchill spends a good part of his book on this subject trying to point out that he was one of the victims of what happened. He's often been portrayed as the architect

Speaker 1:          02:54:38       and if you ever want to see how frustrating history can be some times look at churchill's thinking on all this because when you examine it, it's so logical. He's doing exactly what any of us would hope somebody in a position of power would do in terms of going down the arguments and the risks and benefits logically, and it still turns out horribly. What sort of lesson is that teaching to the other commanders who were saying, yes, just keep smashing against the wall or my goodness doesn't seem to matter whether you think outside the box, you do the same darn stupid pointless thing again and again. The first world war equalizes the results of both of that. In a. You're darned if you thinking you're darned if you don't think churchill. Basic assumption was that the british empire was sitting on an enormously powerful fleet that was useless and the part that was useless is so useless you can't even use it. If the enemy fleet comes out to fight, there's a whole bunch of british ships that were made obsolete only in 19. Oh six. Remember it's 19, 14, 1915. What happened in 19? Oh six. A brand new type of battleship arrived on the scene, became the name, you know, the initial ship's name was dreadnought and that becomes the name for that entire type of vessel,

Speaker 1:          02:55:55       a dreadnought or super dreadnought. That's a class name now, and that's because that's how revolutionary this ship was. The problem is, is the instantly it arrives on the scene. It makes obsolete fleets of hugely expensive vessels, dozens and dozens and dozens of them that have been built up over a lifetime makes them obsolete overnight, and of course the british being the greatest navy in the world. They had the most of these battleships, the older battleships, the ones that in 19, oh, five or the greatest force of float and in 19, oh, six are ready for the scrap heap, and that's what churchill said. All these ships were heading for. What are we saving them for? They're just going to be scrapped after the war and he says that the admiral's had these emotional attachments to these ships because they had served on the more they remembered the day when these were the most powerful war ships afloat and churchill's attitude is these are assets to be used up for. AGain, we can use them in the dardanelles and if we lose them, we don't lose anything, but he's got a lot of them.

Speaker 1:          02:56:54       winston churchill's plan of using the fleet in a lightening attack that the turks weren't ready for with massive forest. I could just force the straights before anyone could respond to it turns into something totally different over the next several weeks, and churchill has always claimed that the events were completely out of his control, but he uses as an argument the line that he was told that there were no troops available, so any plan he came up with pretty much had to have a tiny little group of marines to run on shore and knock out a gun if necessary, but nothing else. So he says basically he can't be responsible for this land disaster that's about to happen. He never assumed there'd be any troops anyway, and here's what he says. Quote at the evening meeting of the war, counsel on January 28th when the final decision to adopt the plan was taken, lord kitchener, repeated quote, we have at present, no troops despair.

Speaker 1:          02:57:47       It was on that foundation alone that all our decisions in favor of a purely naval attack had been taken, but hence forward a series of new facts and pressures came into play which gradually, but unceasingly changed the and enormously extended the scale of the enterprise under these influences. In less than two months, the naval attack with its lack of certainty, but with its limited costs and risks became subsidiary and in its place there are rows and military development of great magnitude over this new plan. The admiralty had no responsible control. Our advice did not prevail, are criticisms were not welcomed and even inquiries became a matter of delicacy intact. Nonetheless, by the results of this military operation, we had to stand or fall and quote, I know you don't need translation for me, but isn't that the same as saying, hey, that wasn't my idea. You changed it, but I still have to be responsible for it.

Speaker 1:          02:58:45       You see a lot of post world war one memoirs that sound like that. Nonetheless, it adequately explains how out of control the process. Seeing once churchill and his cabal had taken their little private idea and had it adopted by not just one government, but the allies as the plan and of course in the final analysis, the people with the most control over your plan. If you're winston churchill or the ones on the scene who actually have to make it work. The military commanders in this case, the admiral's on February 17th, a couple of those admirals are leading the most powerful fleet that's ever gone to war. Now I say that as sort of leaving a little loophole because the most powerful fleet in the world is the british fleet sitting up in scapa, flow up in scotland, waiting for the german fleet to come out and play, but that leads never done anything.

Speaker 1:          02:59:39       They're waiting for their chance. The largest most powerful fleet that's ever gone to war and tried to do something so far. This one, 18 or so battleships, most of them british, some of them french. Most of these, the old battleships that were made obsolete a decade before, but also including, you know, the newest super dreadnought, the queen elizabeth with 15 inch guns, you know, 12 or so cruisers, 30 destroyers, a couple hundred transports. This fleet might not have lasted very long against the crack in the german fleet, but in this part of the world, it's the most powerful force afloat and would have been the greatest athlete in the world a decade before it arrives. You know, off the coast of Turkey and begins shelling those straits on February 19th and things start slowing down. The plan is to batter your way through, destroy all these fortresses as you continue to move deeper and deeper into this sort of river like piece of geography, but you know the weather gets bad, so the fleet retreats, you know, to a safe distance and then it comes up and they shell some force and then something else goes wrong and churchill is sitting back in britain going crazy.

Speaker 1:          03:00:45       PullIng his hair out. Sending messages after message is basically saying, hurry, hurry, hurry. The whole plan requires you to hurry because the longer they take, the more you lose. This whole idea that there's some surprise to it that catches the turks off guard and so the turks have already figured out when you see the largest fleet that had ever gone to war, oh, the british are doing something down here. The good news is that does take away troops fighting the russians and take some pressure off the tsar, which was the reason he asked for help in the first place. The bad news is instead of the british advancing against a totally unready foe, you know, and taking advantage of surprise, they're sitting there giving the whole basic idea way for months on the 18th of March, the fleet decides to try again in a big way. Churchill's back there, prodding them, get to work, get out there, do it, big attack and the 18 battleships and the whole fleet goes in and start shelling the forts.

Speaker 1:          03:01:39       Some marines are detached and send on land to go take some of these sports that are particularly troublesome and then shit hits a mine. A french battleship rolls over really quickly. About 700 people die, boom, fast before anyone's had time to digest that. Another one hits a mine and then another one, and by the way on the scene, they don't know that these are mines. Mines are one of the things they thought about torpedoes or another. All they know is big, expensive, important ships, at least in the old days, are starting to sink and list and explode and the commander is pull everything back and by the time they get away from the streets they've lost or seeing crippled six battleships now what winston churchill would say and what he did say is, who cares? These are old battleship. They're not of any use to us at all, so use them to take the straits, but at least take the streets.

Speaker 1:          03:02:35       He said the admiral's had a whole different opinion. They didn't see this as an asset to be used. They saw it as a charge to protect these admirals. He said, had an emotional attachment to these ships. They walked their decks back when they were young officers in these ships were the queens of the seas and he says, now they had this attachment. They didn't want to lose them, and the whole point was they were there because they were losing a bowl. Again, what's so terrible about what follows is churchill, his attitude was that this fleet was totally expendable, but in order to protect this expendable fleet, the high command decides the ground troops had to be sent in. They pulled the fleet back. They begin assembling these 80,000 men that they're going to attack. This area within. The plan is to overwhelm this peninsula called the gallipoli peninsula.

Speaker 1:          03:03:22       That's right next to the dardanelles and take over all those fortune, all those gun positions with your ground troops. Then those guns won't fire on your little teeny minesweepers who are clearing the streets of the mines and then your big battleships won't get mind, but it's the tail wagging the dog here and churchill and others have said, ever since the war was over that this was a disaster waiting to happen because the whole point of this plan is to use strategic surprise to catch the enemy off guard. How's the going to be going to be caught off guard when it takes five weeks after the battleships pull

Speaker 5:          03:03:58       back to get the ground forces onto the beaches? The turks are commanded by a german general. In this case, a very competent guiding liman von sanders, who supposedly says if the allies will just give him eight days, he can put together a defense. He's desperate for time, eight days, just give me eight days. They gave him five weeks and by the time the landings take place in late april, early may, 19, 15, to say that the turks are ready, maybe is a little bit presumptuous, but they're waiting and you get a chance to see what the worst nightmares of allied planners who were planning for d day in the second world war. You know the attack across the beaches, across the english channel, landing allied troops on the occupied french coastline. You can see what their nightmares must have been like because they were young men. When they got to see how something like an amphibious assault could go wrong because they saw it on the beaches of gullapalli. First of all, it was a nightmare of improvisation.

Speaker 5:          03:05:04       These troops were trained for war, not trained for amphibious assault. They landed sometimes on the wrong beaches. They had completely somehow gotten the terrain or wrong. Even with aerial surveillance. I mean the poor australians are landed in a cove a mile from where they were supposed to land. It's like a reverse amphitheater and historian john keegan who visited the site said, the one thing that overwhelms you when you go there is how tiny it is. It's this tiny little cove and you drop a ton of australians there with the high ground all around them like an amphitheater and just leave them there on some of these beaches. The allies are able to land route relatively easily and try to capture the high ground on other beaches they land and aren't sure what to do on a couple of these beaches. The turks are waiting for them and massacres in shoe. In one, the allies had taken a like a transport ship and cut out a hole in it so that they could drive it right up on the beach and the soldiers could just jump out and be ready to fight. The turks trained machine guns on the door and when the door opened and all these troops jumped out, they were machine guns one by one by one. As they hit the beach, less than 25 of them made it to the beach out of several hundred.

Speaker 5:          03:06:21       Even when the allied forces at great cost sometimes take these beaches, they're not always sure what to do next. They have no idea how things are going on the beach next to them. They don't know if the ship's know where they are, the ships don't know where they are. There's no coordination going on and you really get a wonderful object lesson in which you're also getting on the western front concerning what weapons system is really missing from this war. I mean it exists, but not in a way where it's coordinated, not in a way that you'll see it come of age in the next world war. It's one of those things that when you consider in a vacuum,

Speaker 1:          03:06:56       it doesn't even sound like a weapon. It's like barbed wire. You don't think of barbed wire as a weapon. You don't think of radio communications as a weapon either, but it's been the missing ingredient in so many of these missed opportunities in this war. If only the troops that broke through knew they broke through, if only they could change where the artillery was shooting. If only we could bring up reinforcements. This happens all the time on the western front. Now it's happening at [inaudible]. Sometimes these troops land and they just sort of stand there. They don't know what they're supposed to do next. Or they take the first position that the plans ahead of time called for them to take and they stopped there. What would you expect them to do? They don't know what's going on.

Speaker 1:          03:07:36       They have to be careful or their own artillery is going to shell them. The problem is is once again, it allows the turks to respond and you will see a lot of fighting going on for the high ground of these areas that overlook the beaches and you know, this whole plan still might have work is the turks had turned out to be a soft enemy. You know, if they'd turned out to be as weak and as decadent and as you know, unmotivated as allied planner sort of assumed that they would be. Instead, they fought like lions, which the turks are capable of. The turks are very dangerous soldiers. The ethnic turks especially, and there'll be an incident at one of the tops of these heights were allied forces are fighting with turkish forces, led by a guy named mustafa kemal, who after the war will become one of the most important figures in postwar Turkey. It's about 35 years old and he sees the allied forces in his area reaching the heights. Everybody knows that these heights are going to be important and he orders his troops that are out of ammunition to hold them off and he says these famous lines that have gone down in turkish history. He says, quote,

Speaker 1:          03:08:43       I don't order you to attack. I order you to die in the time which passes until we die. Other troops and commanders can take our place. End quote. That's about the opposite reaction of what the allies were expecting. The turk resistance to be like. The allied resistance is just as spirited. The australians and new zealanders and gurkhas. To Be honest, we'll prove themselves some of the best, if not the best fighters in the war on these beaches, but they're completely hamstrung by the screw up of the situation and in almost no time, the gallipoli campaign turns into a mediterranean version of the western front and it's got all the same tragic hallmarks that the western front has barbed wire artillery, no man's land trenches. The whole thing and the military historian would point out that of course it does. It's the same situation, the same things and conditions that created the need to have people dig into the earth and they created the power of the defensive over the offensive is just present in the mediterranean

Speaker 5:          03:09:54       and the aegean as it is on the western front. The australians find out about this firsthand and I grew up next to an air force colonel when I was a kid who fought in the second world war and I used to ask him who the toughest soldiers were. You know, wHen I'm eight. That was an interesting question to me and I always wanted to hear something like the germans and I remember he surprised me once by saying the british in general and the australians and New Zealand troops specifically, and I said, why? And he said because you would find yourself in these horrible situations and they would be laughing and joking and he said, that's indicative of a, of a level of bravery that you don't normally see, but it doesn't always help you. There's a story, um, of an australian corporate who wrote about being pinned down on one of these beaches when they land and the turks have the high ground and they're shooting down at these poor australians who are trying to get their act together, get organized, figure out what we do next while they're under fire and while their friends are dying.

Speaker 5:          03:10:52       And yes, for a little while, some of them are laughing. He writes, quote, a galling fire rained on us from the left where there were high cliffs. One man dropped down alongside me laughing. I broke the news to him gently. You've got yourself into the hottest corner you'll ever strike. I'd shown him where the enemy were. He fired a few shots and again, I heard the sickening thought of a bullet. I looked at him in horror. The bullet had fearfully mashed his face and gone down his throat, rendering him dumb, but his eyes were dreadful. To behold, how he squirmed in agony. There was nothing I could do for him, but pray that he might die swiftly. It took them about 20 minutes to accomplish this and by that time he tangled up his legs and pain and stiffened. I saw the waxy color creep over his cheek and breathe easier and cool.

Speaker 5:          03:11:40       Amazing to think about this one person who's got to consider his own life, which is under attack, how he deals with troops, who need him, and he gets to watch that going on for 20 minutes to. If I tend to focus on the horror and the story, ladies and gentlemen, it's because that's what gets to me. Any history read on any subject is going to by its very nature the person telling the story, usually a historian, but then sometimes you get stuck with me is going to focus on the things that intrigue or interest them for me. It's what these people had to go through on all sides and it's the horror that I constantly try to imagine myself experiencing and it's mind blowing to me and I think after as many shows as we've done, the ones who've stayed with me listening like you, there's got to be something that touches you too.

Speaker 5:          03:12:26       AT the literally. You have this same charnel house situation where dead bodies are a part of your life and living amongst them is part of the horror. It's bad enough that your life is always at stake, that you watch all this death and destruction, but you live with corpses. Corpses of people you often know or knew. This is a remembrance by british soldier leonard thompson who arrives at the dardanelles right after the major landing quote. We arrived at the dardanelles and saw the guns flashing and heard the rifle fire. They heaved our ship, the river clyde, right up to the shore. They had cut a hole in it and made a little pier, so we were able to walk straight off and onto the beach. We all sat there on the hellespont waiting for it to get light. The first things we saw were big wreck turkish guns.

Speaker 5:          03:13:17       The second a big marquee. It didn't make me think of the military, but if the village phets, other people must have thought like this too, because I remember hoW we all rushed up to it like boys getting into a circus and then found it all laced up. We unlaced it and rushed in. It was full of corpses, dead englishman, lines and lines of them with their eyes wide open. We all stopped talking. I'd never seen a dead man before and here I was looking at two or 300 of them. It was our first fear. Nobody had mentioned this. I was very shocked and I thought of suffolk and how it seemed to happy place for the first time we set to work to bury people. We push them into the sides of the trench, but bits of them kept getting uncovered and sticking out like people in a badly made bed.

Speaker 5:          03:14:03       Hands were the worst. They would escape from the sand, pointing, begging, even waving. There was one which we all shook when we passed by saying good morning in a posh voice, everybody did it. The bottom of the trench was springy like a mattress because of all the bodies underneath at night when the stench was worse, we tied crepe around our mouth and noses. This crepe had been given to us because it was supposed to prevent us from being gassed. The flies entered the trenches at night and lined them completely with a density which was like moving cloth. We killed millions of them by slapping our spades along the trench wall, but the next night it would be just as bad. We were All lousy and we couldn't stop shitting because we caught dysentery. We wept not because we were frightened. We were so dirty and quote and like a bad movie.

Speaker 5:          03:14:55       The gallipoli campaign, which was supposed to do an end around the suffering of the western front and ended more quickly by striking, you know, the weak joint in the enemy's alliance just extended that suffering to a new front. The entire affair will get continually worse as generals and admirals, who don't want to admit defeat, keep pouring more and more reinforcements into it. The turks do the same thing. It just becomes this ongoing hell and this ongoing hell will eventually cost winston churchill his job. In fact, the british government essentially has to reorganize. They have to create a coalition government and churchill's the one left out. He will leave the admiralty were told after being sacked with tears in his eyes, certain that his career is over. Talk about one of the great mistakes all time. Obviously he has a great career ahead of him, but churchill, a weird guy and then we'd have to watch myself with him because I liked him.

Speaker 5:          03:15:57       I think a lot of us like him as a historical figure. He's quite likable, teddy roosevelt's the same way, but you have to remember that these guys have qualities that make them somewhat unusual and it's hard to factor those qualities into the man. Churchill told one of his best friends in february 19, 15, the time when he's planning this whole [inaudible] thing, something that's relatively shocking to hear when the whole world is stunned by the carnage of the worst war in human history. He told his friend this quote, I think a curse should rest on me because I love this war. I know it's smashing and shattering the lives of thousands every moment, and yet I can't help it. I enjoy every second of it and to quote, imaGine if the people whose loved ones were over there fighting and dying and her churchill admitted that and you know, one of the things that happens when you use churchill's account of these events that he played an important role in is you get all his excuses and you get his point of view and you get, you know, very one sided account of these affairs where churchill is the hero and he was right all along and if only people had listened to him and if only they hadn't screwed up, his plans at all would have been great.

Speaker 5:          03:17:12       But there are very good historians, Peter Hart and britain I find to be very fair and he had this to say, and he's not on the churchill was right bandwagon. He wrote about the whole gullapalli affair. Quote apologists for the gallipoli campaign have long tried to boast of what could have been with a heavy emphasis on if only this fails to recognize that the allies bought the campaign with levels of naval and military support that were considered acceptable until the turks defeated them. Time and time again, hamilton promised success again and again, he failed. Go liberally was one of a series of military easterner adventures launched without proper analysis of the global strategic situation without consideration of the local tactical situation, ignoring logistical realities, underestimating the strength of the opposition, and predicted on a hugely optimistic assessment of the military capabilities of their own troops. Not for nothing is hubris regarded as the english disease, but the gallipoli campaign was a serious matter. vital resources have been drawn away from where it really mattered. The turks were all but helpless if left on their own. They had tried to launch an ambitious attack across the sinai desert on the suez canal, but had been easily thwarted. Gullapalli achieved nothing but to provide the turks with the opportunity to slaughter british and french troops and copious numbers in a situation in which everything was in the defenders favor. Meanwhile, back on the western front was the real enemy, the german pyre and quote, and by saying that [inaudible] was a side show

Speaker 1:          03:18:48       and blaming churchill in large part for the disaster. While this tragic side show was going on, another horrible disaster was as well. This is a conflict after all full of horrible disasters, but this one was somewhat different from soldiers fighting it out on battlefields. This one involved an entire people, several entire peoples in fact, and it is perhaps the most argued about case of genocide in world history.

Speaker 1:          03:19:26       In order to understand the context of what we're about to talk about, we need to recall how much of a role the idea of ethnic self-determination plays in leading up to the conditions that create the first world war and to the first world war itself. Remember, there are a bunch of centuries old pre 20th century empires that sort of stumbled into the 20th century carrying all sorts of baggage from previous era's with them. Baggage that is in part tearing them apart and a lot of this baggage is ethnic. Take. The austrian hungarian empire is a perfect example. Here's a multiethnic empire with a ton of different ethnicities in it that are presided over by a german slash hungarian elite on paper. All these people are equal austro-hungarian subjects, but if you happen to not be german or hungarian, often you don't feel very equal and during this time period, many different ethnic groups are either looking to create their own states for themselves or they're looking to join with ethnic brethren of theirs that have already done this.

Speaker 1:          03:20:35       When the first world war is touched off, let's recall it's touched off by a serb nationalist, someone the slavs would probably look at as a patriot, but the austro-hungarian is looked at him as a terrorist and looked at any of their own people that wanted to join with Serbia. A not that old country created by the ethnic serves. Anyone who wanted to do that, who was an austro-hungarian subject was now treasonous and an insurrectionist and a rebel. And if you'rE actually in a war with that country, you're a fifth columnist or a cancer on your nation

Speaker 1:          03:21:09       and there's no question that there are a bunch of empires that are dealing with these problems. And then there are a bunch that just sorta put those problems off. Even the winners in the first world war, for example, britain and France are only going to push these questions farther down the road and after the next world war, the british will be dealing with similar situations in India and the french will be dealing with it in north africa and indochina, but the ostrow hungarians and the russians and the ottoman empire deal with it now and it creates huge problems and it does so in a realm that is historically extremely violent inducing ethnic in these old empires where people have very long memories and everybody has, you know, atrocities that the other side is committed over the centuries that they can point to as a justification for what they are going to do. Now,

Speaker 1:          03:22:01       modern people can think, for example, of the situation in the middle east right now and how to sit down with anyone who's involved, you know, close at hand with those conflicts. The first thing you find out is everyone has a ton of bad things that they can point to that the other side did, and after a while your head just spins because you don't even know where to start. Everyone's got such long memories and there are so many bad things that have happened that they pointed. The other side is being responsible for that. you just don't even know how to solve that problem and untie that gordian knot, but that's nothing compared to the ethnic memories of people in europe and anyone who remembers the breakup of the former yugoslavia and the middle 19 nineties in a will remember. That's a perfect example of how deep these ethnic tensions go.

Speaker 1:          03:22:47       You know, we were all under the impression that that whole ethnic animosity between groups in those areas had been tamed and that those fires had been completely put out. Little did we know that the heat under the ashes were smoldering the whole time that all it took was a little gasoline poured on the smoldering heat for it to flare up and for horrible things to be done. And then when you went and questioned anyone, for example, a serb or croat or a bosnian muslim about it, they would point to the other side and talk about hundreds of years of awful things that they had done to them. You don'T even know where to begin with ethnic hatred like that. The worst situation of this kind that happens in the first world war, although it happens in a lot of places. Let's not forget, during the 1915 retreat, the russians did a lot of terrible things to poles and jews. I mean, these things get paled though in the history books by comparison with what happened to the christian minorities in the ottoman empire.

Speaker 1:          03:23:46       For example, the greeks who have been inhabiting the anatolian plain of asia minor since the bronze age, or the assyrian people, the christian, the syrian minority. I'm in what's now kind of northern Iraq and who claim to be the descendants of the ancient assyrians. Which if that's true, that's a weird, horrible karmic wheel of genocide coming around, hit them. Because after all, the biblical assyrians are one of the very early confirmable, you know, instigators of ethnic cleansing and genocide. You can find ben, of course, the most famous of all the armenians. The armenians are an ancient people who inhabit an area that during the first world war is kind of around where the borders of Russia and the ottoman empire come together to historic arch enemies. The armenians caught in the middle

Speaker 5:          03:24:44       and they always have been certain periods in history. They've been able to form their own independent state. For example, when rome, persia, we're a little weak. They could do that. And then as soon as roman persian, the ancient world got their act together from. They swallowed up Armenia. Armenia was the first official christian state, which did not particularly make the ottomans enthusiastic.

Speaker 5:          03:25:05       It's kind of part of the reasons that the armenians in the ottoman empire had always been treated as second class citizens and they remind one of the jews in Russia where periodically you would have these pogroms or these, these incidents of violence breakout that are just appalling when men, women, and children would just be slaughtered. I mean, there were in 18, 95, 18, 96, the sultan hammad, um, did awful things and from 50,000 to 300,000 armenians died and just that one. And then there was another one a couple years later in another one, a couple years after that, in 1,909, there was another one and the armenians are between a rock and a hard place because part of them live in what's the ottoman empire, but part of their territory and ethnic group extends up into southern Russia and area by the way that Russia had been taking over over the past century. So it's, it's sort of a battle ground area. And you take this people that the ottoman turks had never been that enthusiastic about any way. And then you start this war. Remember the russians and the turks start fighting in late 19, 14, early 1915. And the turks get defeated by the russians. They have that napoleonic retreat where the wolves are eating all the frozen people and a lot of that army that beat the turks in that battle were composed of armenians, armenians from the russian side of the border,

Speaker 5:          03:26:26       a bunch of the ottoman troops in the defeated army or also armenians. And to make matters even more complicated, there were some armenian rebels who were trying to create some sort of a state of their own

Speaker 5:          03:26:39       and who can blame them by the way, for wanting their own state after so much persecution for so long, but the way the ottoman empire viewed these people, you know, what the best of times was unreliable once the russians, when that important battle in late 19, 14, early 1915 and the turks field their back up against the wall. Now they begin to worry that the armenians on their side of the border are positively dangerous to them. You know, the ones who are loyal are potentially vulnerable to subversion or propaganda or maybe even having the guerrilla groups, um, you know, coerce them into cooperation through age old practices like killing collaborators as it's called. That's the best case scenario. Worst case scenario, you're armenian subjects are disloyal to the core and are hoping, waiting and actively working behind the scenes to help the russians when to the turkish government. This is treason. They are feeling like they they're either about to be or are being stabbed in the back and their government, as we said, never all that enthused about armenians anyway decided that a solution has to be found and their solution is to get rid of the armenians. If you believe the official turkish line, getting rid of the armenians meant relocating them. If you believe what the vast majority of historians and obviously armenians believe, getting rid of the meant killing them.

Speaker 5:          03:28:03       The process when it began with systematic one village after another, it was done with a certain amount of understanding that it would be bad publicity. The Christian Powers Russia mainly, but also britain and France had oftentimes used persecution against the armenians and other christian groups as an excuse to intervene in the internal affairs of the ottoman empire. That's the way the ottoman empire would look at it. So to them, there was all the reason in the world not to publicize that you were doing this and not make a big deal out of it. The official line of the turkish government is that during these efforts to move the armenian people away from the trouble spot, they won't be a problem if you move them to say Syria. A lot of them died through starvation, through disease, through hostile ethnic groups that never liked them, liked the courage, deciding to take advantage and swoop in and killed a man and raped the women and all the horrible things. But there's so much evidence that this was done in the same sort of fashion that any one of us would recognize genocide being if it was the holocaust or Rwanda or it really reminds one of the former yugoslavia a lot. And the turks are very sensitive about this and the armenians are very angry that they won't admit it. You know, this is where I get a little upset with this whole thing.

Speaker 5:          03:29:21       The idea of genocide as an official international crime only arose in the middle 19 forties.

Speaker 5:          03:29:30       And since that time, that word has become a legal hot potato where it would, if someone were actually convicted of genocide trigger all sorts of real world ramifications. And so everybody does everything they can for the most part, unless it's a pariah state to find anything except genocide. Well, it's hundreds of thousands of people died. Oh, but it's merely a crime against humanity because there was no intent. I mean you have to. It's become a legalistic word where all the different things have to be met and it's a big deal if they are countries can find themselves, you know, dealing with sanctions or calls for reparations or issues with alliances or trade deals. And, and Turkey didn't want that. Nobody wants that. I mean, even in countries that acknowledged their genocidal practices at one time, they were a group that have arisen in them, are trying to get that overturned in Japan.

Speaker 5:          03:30:21       There are right wing nationalists now who are trying to now cover up and downplay japanese genocidal activities against China during the second world war. It's the most normal thing in the world, but we've all done it. That's why it's hard for me to understand the turkish attitude that this is a bloated, their pride, if they hadn't committed the genocide, they be what? Like one of the only people on the planet have any consequences that hadn't. It's part of the shared human experience. As sad as that sounds. Go. Look at the old testament of the bible, a book the jews, christians and muslims all hold sacred. The god of the old testament orders genocide after genocide, after genocide, kill everyone put the men, women, children, and all the animals to the sword. The reason it's in the old testament is because that was such a common behavior that those people at the time would have understood it too.

Speaker 5:          03:31:20       I've often said about slavery, that we all have slaved blood running through our ancestral veins somewhere. same is true for genocide. We've all had ancestors who were the victims of genocidal attacks and we've all had ancestors somewhere down the family tree who were the ones committing the genocide in their book. Why not killed them? All professors, daniel and clark mccauley, right? That one of the downsides of this whole thing is that we act as though that bad man or that bad people committed this unusual act when in reality, as they say, quote, given the right circumstances, normal human beings are all too ready to kill by category and quote, you will often hear the turks in their own defense when accused of the armenian genocide say, well, look at what was happening to muslims and turkish folks who were in the balkans and who were being treated by those countries that had thrown off the turkish yoke to rape and murder and all these horrible things and displacement and all that is totally true, but it doesn't alleviate turkish guilt in the armenian situation.

Speaker 5:          03:32:31       It just adds more people to the court docket. What happeNed to the armenians and other christians in the ottoman empire during this time, including greeks and syrians, was a tragedy between 500,001 point 5 million armenians died. Women, children, men, old people, lots of rapes, horrible stories. Sounds like the einsatzgruppen under the nazis. Sounds like Rwanda. Sounds like Indonesia sounds most like the former yugoslavia in the 19 nineties on steroids, but I don't blame the turks anymore than I blame the rest of us for it. That's human behavior and what's interesting is the armenian genocide actually overshadows something similar to it involving the russians retreating in 1915 from a german offensive in Poland and at gunpoint, taking hundreds of thousands of poles and jews out, and a lot of those people never returned. They were seeing in the same way that the armenians were seen by the turks as unreliable, disloyal elements likely to side with the germans and interestingly enough, in a wonderful sort of karmic way, a lot of the reports that are considered to be the most reliable about what the armenians were going through come from the turks allies, the germans, chairman advisers and military officials and ambassadors who are telling their own government about the terrible things that are happening to the armenians in that country. And then within a generation, those stories will be coming out of Germany.

Speaker 5:          03:34:09       That's how endemic. This whole idea of killing your enemies down to the last person are as terrible as this is. That's the way we are as human beings

Speaker 1:          03:34:25       and killing your enemies down to the last person is not just beginning to look like the equation in these horrible criminal genocides and starting to look like the equation. You know in that algebraic problem. If you're one of the military commanders in this conflict of how you win the war itself, not killing every man, woman and child, just killing every soldier on the other side.

Speaker 1:          03:34:52       You know, after another horrible battle on the western front in 1915 when the allies lose a ton of people to gain literally not an inch of territory. The french general baton becomes one of the first ally commanders to openly say that this war is not going to be won by some miraculous breakthrough or some tactical or strategic bit of brilliance that opens up into a flank or a breakthrough. It's going to be won by killing more of the enemy than we lose ourselves. The wars turning into a war of attrition and while that might sound like an ultimate allied victory, because if everybody kills, you know one person on the other side until there no one left. The allies have a lot more people than the central powers. The problem with that little bit of mathematics is that the central powers are killing more allied troops and they're losing themselves and will do so every single month until almost the end of the war.

Speaker 1:          03:35:48       So that mathematical equation is as yet unsolved and unpredictable. But of course, modern nations don't fight to the last man. At some point they cry uncle, which in this conflict has been ruled out by the allies signing those treaty saying no one will make a separate piece, which means they'll fight until the political system or the armies or the will of the soldiers to resist collapses. And by the end of 1915, there's a coupLe of countries that look in real danger of having that happen. And even the countries that look quite a bit safer than Austria, Hungary or Russia. Look, even they are showing, you know, cracks and vulnerabilities. Can this war really go on for another year? It's going to go on longer than that, but not everyone is going to make it to the end.

Speaker 1:          03:37:14       like alice susanna, and that's what the child prodigy and genius musical composer mozart is supposed to have answered when someone said, how do you come up with your compositions in a start with the piano and then build off of that, or do you start with the structure and then fill in the middle or. and he's supposed to have said that it comes to him. Gleick alice, suzanne amman at the same time all together. And that phrase keeps popping into my head because that's the biggest challenge in telling this first world war story. The second biggest challenge is the ungodly amount of material that is produced from many different countries and viewpoints about this story. I've never been so overwhelmed with material as I have been for this and it's all controversial, so you really need to read a bunch of different authors and viewpoints to to get a sort of a nice broad view of some of these topics.

Speaker 1:          03:38:07       But the stories can't even be compartmentalized because they affect each other. What's going on in the eastern front affects outcomes on the western front, which affect outcomes in the mediterranean theatre. And so you can't even tell the stories and the separately. They all have to kind of weave together and it's really easy with this much going on to lose track of the story. So I thought we would have a rare little recap as to where we are right now. Sort of broad trends to get us up to speed and a few thoughts from the last show that I'd like to just throw in little extra fluff here at the end, no extra charge. Just bring us up to speed and make sure I've covered them. I have a list of things I want to make sure I get through.

Speaker 1:          03:38:51       I'd hate to get through this whole show and say, oh, I left that out. Nonetheless, are quick recap can be done relatively simply. The war breaks out in august, 19, 14. A bunch of these countries had been ready for it, predicting it. They mobilized quickly. It's all on a timescale and everybody launches. They're prewar battle plans, which for the germans is most famously called the schlieffen plan, advanced through Belgium in a wide arc. Smash the french armies on the head while you're keeping them occupied to the front as well. That doesn't go too well. It does for a while. I mean the. The armies clash and the first month of the war is commonly referred to as the battle of the frontiers. When you get these 19th century tactics running into 20th century, mechanized warfare, which leads to the worst single month in terms of casualties that you're going to get in the whole war because you're not going to see a lot of cavalry charges against machine guns and artillery positions after the first month of the war.

Speaker 1:          03:39:54       That's when the really mindblowingly shocking things. I mean guys with armor and swords and white gloves and red pants and you know, bayonet, charging, prepared positions. I mean the whole thing is is cookie and that lasts for about a month. The next month is what happens after the germans lose the battle of the marne and there schlieffen plan is broken and so the second month of the wars then basically running away from their earlier positions, trying to find a place to regroup, finding a really good place to regroup on the other side of the river ane and digging in and the allies following them, unable to take those wonderful positions on the other side of the river ane and digging in themselves. Inaugurating officially trench warfare. then you have the so called race to the sea. When the germans and the french and the british who don't want to run into each other's prepared defenses anymore, start trying to find a flank in the only open part of the battle line left from the river ane up north towards the see both sides reached the sea before they find a flag.

Speaker 1:          03:40:58       They have a couple of terrible battles including the first battle of april up there, and then we settled down to the 1915 warfare basically, which is going to involve both sides launching offensives that don't do anything and that if you read the book, sometimes they can make them exciting. Oh, they almost broke through and all if they've only been modern communication, but the bottom line is thE bottom line. You have a bunch of battles during 1915 on the western front. Nothing changes on the eastern front. Nothing changes either, but a lot of movement happens. A lot of people die. A lot of movement happens. The overall strategic situation remains the same because when the russians and the germans clash right at the war start, the russians get crushed in the couple of big battles. Tannenberg mazarine lakes. But then they beat the ostroW, hungarians, the serbians beat, the austro-hungarian whole bunch of stuff happens when you turn around and subtract all the deaths and all the movement and everything else.

Speaker 1:          03:41:53       The situation is the same. The russians are there, they're not defeated. They can replace all their losses and if you really want to chase them, they'll run all the way back to moscow like they did against napoleon and like they'll do against hitler. And do you really want to follow them all the way back there so they don't have trench warfare. They have movement warfare, but the movement's not ending anything. And then of course, because the russians and the turks start getting into it down in the south, the russians asked the allies for help, which leads to winston churchill's cabal, having yet another good argument to argue that maybe we should take the dardanelles with all these pre dreadnought battleships and then the dardanelles happen. Now here's where we can kind of add the fluff. I was just promising you because remember one of the sidebar hopes with this dardanelles campaign is that it might influence some of those countries down in that region that hadn't decided which side to join yet, but it was obvious that they were sort of taking bids, Italy most among them.

Speaker 1:          03:42:52       They liked the allied bead better. They saw the dardanelles campaign looking pretty strong back in may, 19, 15, you know when there were landings and troops assaulting the heights every day and it looked like britain and France were strong. So the italians joined the war. They instantly attack the ostrow hungarians at really the only good spot on their board or to do that because the rest of their borders basically the alps and basically the austro-hungarian hungarians have the high ground. Although they find and have found recently, it's, it's almost like something out of the old captain America comic books, you know, with captain America frozen in the snow. except of course he was alive when they defrosted them. These poor austrian and italian soldiers that they're finding with these glaciers melting up in the alps, in these caves. And I mean they look perfect like they were frozen yesterday, their uniforms, their weapons, their facial characteristics, everything.

Speaker 1:          03:43:46       I mean, it's crazy. It's like a time capsule of the most grotesque kind. Nevertheless, the one area that's good for fighting at least compared to the alps, is on the river. He songs though. So the italians attack the austro-hungarian right away at the river is sancho and lose. So then they attack agaIn on the riversand. So this will be called the second battle of the riversand. So when they lose again, they do it again. Third battle of the riversand. So they do it again. The fourth battle of the river. So by the last year of the award there on the twelfth battle of the reverse, monzo and hundreds of thousands have died. And in fact, in only six months of warfare, the italians will have 200,000 casualties and are quickly playing catch up with the rest of the powers. I should point out something about casualties to. We keep using that term and it's worth defining it.

Speaker 1:          03:44:34       casualties is a military term, as many of you know, and it's simply refers to the loss of battles. StrenGth. So if you're a general and it's your army, we're talking about casualties, simply means the number of people you don't have available to fight those who'd been killed, those who have been wounded, those who have been captured, and those who are missing. So when I say casualties, that's what it means. Although missing in this war usually means dead. If I say dead, well, that means killed in action. So the italians, 200,000 casualties within six months, the other power that gets into the war does so in october, and it's the bulgarians, another one of these powers that churchill and his friends at hope to convince to join the allied side when they saw how the dardanelles campaign was going, but by october the dardanelles campaigns really going poorly and the bulgarians had been promised good land and they don't like the serbs anyway. So they joined with the germans and the austrian hungarians, all three of them promptly attack Serbia, um, and knock them out of the war. And there'll be this story, this harrowing story of the serbian army, you know, going all the way through Albania and the mountain passes like a bunch of wraiths starving until they reached the sea. And there'll be evacuated by french and british warships to fight another day.

Speaker 1:          03:45:49       The one thing I wasn't sure if I mentioned in the story, you know, we talked about the second battle of eep or where the germans used poison gas for the first time in a successful way. It was used on the eastern front in a weird way once, um, but after the second battle of eep are the allies start using gas to. And by the end of 1915, the standard mix of shells is you want some high explosive in your mix and you want some shrapnel shells and your mix, which are like giant balls filled with tiny little beebees. And when they explode it's like a giant hand grenade going off. And then the last gels you want mixed into your little triad of, um, you know, horrific ness are your gas shell. So gas high, explosive in shrapnel. You shoot it all at the same time, it makes a nasty little cocktail for the poor troops on the ground,

Speaker 1:          03:46:32       so everyone's got gas and everybody's wearing gas masks now and you end up with these images that are still, to my mind, the greatest images of the first world war because they say the most when you'll see, for example, I love the one that shows a german cavalry, lancer in 1969, 1917 who's wearing the stall helm, which will come into vogue in 1916, which is basically the same basic design. You'll see the german army having the second world war, so he's wearing like a german wehrmacht helmet with a lance on a horse and wearing a gas mask. He's like half medieval knighT and half storm trooper from star wars and that to me encapsulates what this war is. These meetinGs of the modern world with the premodern world, like a historical estuary, like I said, and in fact, you know it's, it's uber modern because really there hasn't been a major war fought with gas since this time period. I mean, there have been incidents of chemical weapons and gas use, but you've never had the major. I mean the second world war, there was none of this.

Speaker 1:          03:47:39       Also, it should be obvious that there have been several theaters that have not gotten much or perhaps any attention from yours truly, and it's not because I don't find them interesting. I mean I think you could do a whole podcast just on the african experience in the first world war, but it's not important to the outcome of the first world war. So when you have to chop in places for time, these are long enough already. You naturally look at the pacific in the first world war or africa because it didn't affect the outcome. What had more of an effect on the outcome are the soldiers from those two areas that were trucked into places like the western front and who fought there. Lots of north africans, lots of subsaharan africans, lots of people from the far east fought on the western front and at places like the dardanelles and eventually at slomka and places like that.

Speaker 1:          03:48:30       So in a funny way, the place where africans and asians had the most impact on the war going one way or the other was the same western front that we normally think of as being a british french canadian sort of preserve and down the road and american one. so by the end of 1915 you basically have a static situation. western front stays unchanged. Eastern front keeps moving around, but everybody's still standing there facing each other down in Turkey. The war has been extended to down there, but it's just stable to one of the reasons this is called the gear of stalemate in the first world war, if you want to talk about something new that has happened, helmets have started arriving. We mentioned the german stall helm a minute ago. The first one is the french helmet. Then the british metal helmet than the german one appears and it's one of those things that doesn't seem like a big deal, but all of those helmet designs will be the basic design that the second world war helmets come from.

Speaker 1:          03:49:34       So they'll all look very familiar and be in vogue for quite a while. At least in their basic look, the german one changes, for example, they all change a little, but also because it boggles the mind a little bit, doesn't it, that you don't get your first metal helmet really till late 1915, which means all these people have been fighting the most artillery intensive war in human history by far with cloth hats on their heads, digging holes in the ground where the only thing that's exposed to fire is the top of your head and it's covered by a hat and forget the obvious thing about like shrapnel exploding in the air and just hitting you in the head. So many of these shells don't come all that close to you. They just Blow tons of rocks and stuff up in the air that then come down and land on your head. How many casualties from the first year of the war could you attribute to the fact that none of these troops had metal helmets? It's crazy to think about and crazy to think that it took them a year to come up with that more than a year.

Speaker 1:          03:50:41       Finally, and I think this firmly belonGs in the casualty area when we're discussing casualties, modern medicine has changed the situation at this conflict and if you're studying military history, you'll notice a very interesting change in the way the casualty death too. Wounded figures show up in this conflict. I'm normally the number of people wounded and the number of people who die are pretty close together. I mean take the crimean war that happened in the 18 fifties. More people died from disease than from combat related wounds. That might've been a little extreme but not that far off the norm by the first world war. That changes immensely and it's because the medical situation has been revolutionized. modern military medicine really begins in the first world war and a lot of these doctors, especially on the western front, our doctors from private practice who have been drafted or who joined and volunteered for the war effort, they're often doing surgeries right near the front.

Speaker 1:          03:51:40       These are people who live in the modern era. When medIcine is starting to be pretty darn good and it completely changes the game. I mean, these people are not just able to save lives and this is sort of a mixed blessing, I guess if you're a soldier, but they will be able for the nation states that they work for to send a lot of these damaged soldiers back to fight again another day and sometimes multiple times. That ends up increasing the ability of many of these states to keep fighting past where they otherwise would have been able to. I mean all you have to do for example, is look at the burn rate on some of these armies. By the end of 1915. By October, 1915, the russians are losing 235,000 men every month. By the end of 1915, 17 months into the war, the total russian casualties are over 2 million men and even though they could replace the human beings, what they can't do is replace the morale of the people in the capital. The czar tells his french and british counterparts at the end of 1915 that the population has turned pacifistic an anti allied.

Speaker 1:          03:52:51       Meanwhile, the western allies are having their own problem. The soldiers in the trenches starting to get a little uppity about their willingness to continue suicidal attacks endlessly. That's not a good sign commander of the german forces. Creating strategy is deciding that if they're really in a war of attrition, why not design the battles to kill the most people instead of having breakthroughs and maneuvers and all that, and eric von falcon hine creates a killing ground to invite the french nation to bleed itself white in the big fleets. Finally come out to play and new technologies debut whose job it is to break this log jam of trenches, machine guns, barbed wire and gas. The year in 1916 is sometimes called the breaker of nations. There's going to be some nations that suffer some mortal wounds before that year is over. All that and more. In part four of blueprint for armageddon.
