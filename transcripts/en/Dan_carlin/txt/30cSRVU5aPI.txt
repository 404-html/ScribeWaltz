Speaker 1:          00:29          I've said before that one of the wonderful side benefits of a gig like this is the chance to speak to people whose work you really admire and talked to them about it, and in this case I have a guest on the program today who is a source, somebody that we use in our work and when we did blueprint for Armageddon, he was sort of my go to guy in terms of somebody that I knew could add a different dimension to the storytelling by having a letter or a document or a quote or something that was just, you know, so visceral or perfect or emotional or that in one short little paragraph managed to capture such a poignant point that just sort of made the whole section of the piece. I mean Peter Hearts work is finding emotional nuggets that just knock you over and then incorporating them into the story in a way where they not only have the most impact, but they managed to add a part of the story that often gets missed.

Speaker 1:          01:33          If you're telling, for example, a story on the first World War, which is Peter Harte specialty. It is so easy to get yourself locked into the giant troop movements in the big decisions made at headquarters and all this. Sometimes you can go the total opposite extreme and it's easy to get caught up in the diary of this one soldier or this one nurse or something like that, but to be able to blend the two in a way that helps you understand, for example, how the decision's made at headquarters with all those high muckety mucks thinking about things abstractly, how they influence and intersect with the lives of some poor guy, mortally wounded in a shell hole, writing his last letter back to his wife and family. It's an art and I think Peter Hart does it as well or better, especially on the subject of the first World War than anyone I've ever read.

Speaker 1:          02:26          So you get to see me enjoying my byproduct. The best aspect of this Gig, the chance to talk to people whose work you admire. People like Peter Hart, who is amongst other things, an oral historian by the way at the British imperial war museum, which is every military history, nuts, dream gig. Love to go to work by a couple of giant 15 inch naval guns. Which one of those, you know, they have several of these war museums, but the main one in London has the big naval guns outside. You just take a picture. Here's where I work, right? Eat your heart out. Anyway, uh, one little note. Normally we have an in house phone system we use when we do interviews, but normally we only use that for North American interviews when we're overseas calls. We've been using sort of an internet system and uh, this time it led us down with some pretty serious glitches at times, especially near the end of the interview.

Speaker 1:          03:21          Not only my apologies to Peter Hart, but to you also. Uh, it's frustrating and there was no way for us to fix it. So I am going to put a couple of, shall we call them end notes after the interview where I both a quote something that we referenced in the show so that we include that, uh, explained something. Mr Hart said at the end that the digital glitches did not make easy to understand and also read a letter that we referenced in the story to something that Peter Hart, a uncovered for one of his books that we used in the blueprint for Armageddon series and reread that to just show you the man's ability to demonstrate the ripples of pain that something like this conflict, you know, created in that era, in those societies, and drop you right into the middle of it for a minute. So without further ado, uh, the wonderful author and oral war historian, maybe a good way to put it, the Great Peter Hart.

Speaker 2:          04:21          So the first thing I want to know because I'm just curious as a person who is absolutely jealous of anyone who can find such a specialty to devote their lives to, um, how did it, for you mostly become because you've done other things but mostly become something about the first world war. What grabbed your interest about this and what is it that keeps you so interested in the subject?

Speaker 3:          04:42          Well, I think it started when I was young and there was a program called the Great Wall, uh, which was all Italian, the 19 sixties, and it was gloomy and miserable and it seems so awful. People suffered so much and for me it's always been that dichotomy. It's a dichotomy between the people who suffered and what the generals did and why they did that because you may or may not realize I, I quite support the approach of the generals and it, it's the way that it's an entirely logical way of behaving, but it's terrible for those that are involved and that has always informed or I hope has informed all the work. I do it. It's, it's, it's, it's what it's all about for me

Speaker 2:          05:27          now. You've been doing it long enough so that you've been around to watch sort of how public perception over time on these events has changed. Because I remember I was born in 1965 and I remember in the United States growing up as a kid, there was a sense about the first world war that it was like the Second World War, but a little less in terms of the good and evil, still the good and evil. The Kaiser was evil man, but not quite to Hitler standards. And then since I've grown up that good evil aspect to first world war has seemed to be, um, to fade over time quite a bit, at least here in the United States. Have you noticed, can you comment a little bit on the differences in the way, you know, Barbara Tuchman writes a book years ago that, that Jack Kennedy reads, that's really particularly hard on the Germans. The stuff I read today has a very different tone. What have you noticed in the change of if we were doing news, we would say the coverage over the last, say, four decades of the first world war.

Speaker 3:          06:23          Oh, I've, I've noticed a fair amount of coverage. My perception has always been that in the end, if there were batteries, then it was the Germans, but that there were a lot of people doing things that were difficult or wrong, um, that there were four or five major m and pause that was struggling together trying to establish domination. A lot of them had agendas that we wouldn't particularly recognizes today has been a pleasant or, you know, uh, the, the, the colonialism, things like that, uh, that, that treatment of the colonies, the way they generally behaved and everything. And for me, um, we have now an acceptance that whilst the Germans pushed the war, they were partly did that because they were being pushed, bothered the Russians and the French and the French who had their own agendas. And it's just become much more complicated. Uh, the thing is, it's not easy, is it? You know, that's the problem with history that when you add new orleans, things stopped being good and evil. So becoming just much more complex

Speaker 2:          07:32          now. One of the things you do so fantastically, we try to do it here too. It's a great if you can pull it off, it's a great way to do it. You pull it off all the time where you're able to take the reader from the macro, you know you'll have us in the in the board room and you'll have quotes from assistance to the great grand strategists who are deciding how to use troops on the battlefield and then all of a sudden you'll telescope down to some poor, a combatant who's injured mortally in some shell hole who's writing alas, letter to his wife and kids that he's going to strapped to his body to find later. First of all, you know, explain to the listener a little bit how you go about finding these materials. It would seem to me to be one of the luxuries of working in a in a semi modern era. I mean the poor Roman historian has much less in the way of letters from combatants to go on, but. But you're able to mind emotionally mine this material out there. How do you find it? And if it's as powerful as it is on the sterile text page as I'm reading it, how much more powerful is it for you when you're holding the, the actual stained letter in your hands?

Speaker 3:          08:39          Well, I'd say more than my books that I found a letter that was from a French soldier. I used that, but I am extremely lucky that I have been for the last 30, 35 years, the oral historian at the imperial war. So I a did all the, a lot. Not all at all, but I did a lot of the first row or interviews with veterans and that provided with a fantastic source which the war museums allowed me to use. And secondly, I have worked closely with the Department of documents there that uh, and that just opening the dusty old folders that they're all cataloged and preserved by, by the staff. But you know, you open these and you no idea what you're going to find. And sometimes it can be utterly tedious. You know, Joe's letter after letter or boring you. No, no, no. And then suddenly you get someone swimming.

Speaker 3:          09:31          It's really fiscal that, that tears you apart, that you know it, you just get letters at that, you realize these are the last letters. They, you know, you've been reading this bloke's life and then suddenly they're suddenly, it's not his letter, it's a letter from his commanding officer and you know, it. It's amazing. And I just think I'm very lucky to work at the war museum from that. I then look through lots of other sources. I go to other museums, I go to other places and of course I look at personal experience, um, uh, books, mainly old ones, but like I use quite a few modern one serve, you know, or, or regimental history is often have it buried inside them. Personal experience accounts, you know, the Americans. I picked up a lot from the Internet where the pdfs of the books are 19 twenties are online and you can consult them. It's fabulous. And, and that's where I get the material. Uh, and uh, yes, it, it can be, you know, the, the actual real letters that I see at the museum can be really painful.

Speaker 2:          10:33          Obviously humans are humans at Ground Zero, but when you're reading and you focus mostly on the British side of the experience, but you cover everything, do you notice any broad, broad differences in, say you're reading something from ground zero from a French soldier or some German soldier on the line versus some British or American soldier. Are there any differences in terms of the way that their national characteristics sort of come through in the material or at ground zero when you're sitting in a trench with artillery falling all around you are. We are. We are broadly the same.

Speaker 3:          11:06          I very much go for broadly the same. I'm not a great believer in national characteristics I need anyway. It can help sometimes it's a shorthand to explain certain things, but if you take it too literally it goes into dark alleys. Uh, what, what, uh, I really think though is that underneath human beings when they placed under real pressure tend to respond in a similar sort of way. And for me, a French soldier that the accounts, you know, sometimes I have to translate which can be difficult. Um, gray, uh, a friend of Mine, translation to the German ones for me because I don't speak or read German. And fundamentally they're the same. They have slightly different ways of expressing themselves, but that's just cultural. But underneath, when the shelves are falling, when their friends are killed, uh, when they given oldest, it could lead them to be killed. There. The same sort of people. They are, uh, you know, uh, they are, they're just ordinary people.

Speaker 2:          12:07          You know, that's maybe one of the things that at least I imagine touches many people once they start in a reading about the war is these, these incidents where, you know, the, the comradeship. Maybe the German soldiers would say, but we're, the soldiers have multiple sides who, you know, more and more modern history's we'll talk about how prisoners would be killed sometimes and all the horrors of war. And yet at the same time, you know, the notion is when these people end up having truces where they, you know, share Christmas decorations or play football, as you guys would call it soccer, we would call it or, or any of the many, many incidents like that getting stuck in a shell hole with someone from the other side in your latest book that was a primary source quote where a British soldier had his arm really badly injured and goes marching to the back with a bunch of German prisoners who start doctoring his wounds. Do you notice, I mean I don't see as much of that and it might be part of the historiography or what have you, part of the myth making. But when I read stuff in the Second World War, I find a lot less of that than in the first world war. Anything in on the front of your mind that might account for the difference there? Or Am I just imagining that there is one?

Speaker 3:          13:17          If there is a there, there was more hatred in the Second World War. I think we all, it's only our opinions from the things we've read and, but I, I into, I've interviewed an awful lot of second one more second world war soldiers in the first world war, so I'll just, and there is more hatred there, bit bit because of the nature of the regime they're fighting. Now. The communist regime in Russia was pretty rough as well, but, but there was a hatred of the Nazis, but very rarely in any war, there are not many soldiers that, that, that, that, that respond, uh, with murder and torture. And the rest of it, most of them in my experience, uh, a main maintain a lid on their emotions. And, and, uh, it's, it's, it's there, but there are a few who do respond with, with, uh, uh, well, just murder, you know, or, or panic.

Speaker 3:          14:12          Often it's panic. The trick, the trick is the murder. So the first World War that you've mentioned it first up, comradeship is the thing that binds the army's together. But most of all, it binds. It binds you to your fellow soldiers. That's what helps you. That's what it lets you go over the top. It's, it's not a king and country a or precedent. Uh, it's not, um, it's not religion. What in the end when it all comes down to, it's mostly the bugs. You're with your mates, the, the men who went through training with who faced death with you, that that's what helps you get through it.

Speaker 2:          14:55          You know, you mentioned something going over the top a minute ago, such an iconic way of differentiating the, at least western front experience of this war from all the others. And you know, it occurs to me that because of sort of the nature of technology and the way things have gone, I don't think you're ever going to get the same experience that those first world war soldiers went through ever again. I mean, I don't think you're ever gonna have hundreds and hundreds or thousands of guns peppering a small space of territory anymore. You don't need to because of the accuracy. You're never going to mix them with gas the way you did. I mean, if you think as I do that that would have been equal to the worst place a soldier could have ever been right in front of the line about to go over the top western front.

Speaker 2:          15:40          I don't think you're ever going to get that experience again. You're never going to have human beings watch. Uh, I think I forgot the. I'm the author who had said one of the soldiers described watching a forest disappear in front of his eyes due to artillery. I mean, that's a human experience that I don't think any human being's going to ever see again in the beginning of the second world war Churchill's history of the war. He talked about what was in store in 19, 19 if the war hadn't ended in 1918. The various, you know, horrible concoctions that the allies had put together your latest book. The last battle is from that era. Can you talk a little bit about what 19, 19 on the front might have looked like?

Speaker 3:          16:18          Uh, uh, the British had a, the, the, the Germans had that blue cross gas. It didn't work properly. I mixture of a punishes gas and the sort of particles, the particles made you vomit, so he had to take your gas mask off and then they got, you know, the poisonous gas. Got You. Now the German version didn't work properly, but the British had worked out on their allies by the way. I'd worked out how to do it and I fully intended to poison most of the German army in 19, 19. Uh, it, it is a vicious war. Uh, and, and the practices in a way that was just one step forward, you know, the, the um, because we've sort of moved on. Then it was mass barrages. Now there's no need for mass priorities now. And although we did revert to it after El Alamein for instance as well, and they have them on the, in 1944 on the west, only in Europe, but it's replaced by mass bombing isn't it? And then of course it's a nuclear method and then its accuracy and so technology moves on and. But like the killing can still be on a mass scale. For instance, in the Iraq war, there was mass killing the Gulf war, mass killing of a, an it needs to be remembered. What happens is the masculine tends not to be on our side anymore. Um, you know, uh, so that, that pretty well how I feel about it.

Speaker 2:          17:43          Well, it is interesting too, because when we were talking about the first world war in the series that we did on it, you know, you, you, you almost want to overwhelm the listener with both the casualty statistics and then the, the amount of mean, the sheer numbers of things like shells. I mean the numbers overwhelm you. I'm, you know, a lot of Americans, for example, they like to tell jokes about the French and surrendering in the Second World War. And so you would like to point out, Hey, wait a minute, you know, when did our side ever take 27,000 dead in a single day? You know, those kind of numbers are so overwhelming that in the United States, you know, there's not a lot of memorials to the first world war and all this. But you go to Europe and they are everywhere. Um, can you talk a little bit about sort of the lasting effect? I mean, the, the, the feeling of connection to the first world war never died down in Europe. Did it

Speaker 3:          18:33          not really? Well, for the French and Germans, it was monstrously painful business. I mean, they are much hotter than the British. The French in particular, you'll right. That's all nate. Uh, I'd say August 19, 14, the French lost 27,000 dead in a single day. Now the British, when John about suffering, I think a 600 that uh, uh, uh, uh, it's a different scale and the French sector and the French then fault almost on their own for two or three years. People say the Americans took a long time to get into the wall, you know, from a April 19, 17 to a, to well properly June, July 19, 18, 17 years. Not 17 to 19 eight, so bit over a year. But the British took from August 1914 to the somme, July on the somme before we were properly involved. Uh, you know, that people often forget when they're throwing stones at other countries, they forget, like we sometimes do it, the Americans or the Americans or the French or British or the French.

Speaker 3:          19:33          When you look at your own decide we often have the same sort of problems or the same, uh, false. Um, and I find that it's one of those interesting things. Um, the American losses were dreadful in the first world war that they suffered a very high rate of losses from when they fully joined the battle of the battle. Uh, uh, in the, uh, the are gone, the [inaudible] gone region is murderous. It's as murderous as any of the battle in the first world war and considering that they only really for full pelt for three months, the American casualties are worth remembering. But, but for one reason or another possibly could say disengaged from Europe a bit in, in the, in the interwar years, the Americans have never really remembered it in the same way as we do.

Speaker 2:          20:23          Yes. I always try to imagine if the US had fought for two years at those kinds of casualty rates. Um, yeah, we'd have a few more war memorials around here. Certainly would, you know, I think about, um, contexts, you know, if history teaches anything, it helps us understand how things get to where they are and in this country, once again, you know, they'll try to use in political discussions the lessons of history, right? We know from the 19, 38 appeasement stuff that you can't do this or that or the other thing, you know, the classic misuse of the lessons of history, but I always try to, and I'm going to ask you for your opinion on this because you've read a lot of stuff. The generation that gets accused of really doing anything they could to avoid another world war are the ones that lived through it as younger people. How did that scar? The leadership on both sides really in the second world war as they sort of maneuvered jockeyed a threatened try to avoid via compromise a repetition of the worst thing any of them had ever lived through.

Speaker 3:          21:25          I think there's some truth in that I'm not an expert, but certainly that there was peace movements in Britain and France for the French pretty broken by their awful experiences, you know, [inaudible] is the one that gets most of the blame for what happened, but he was responding to a popular element within the country. I see that they just were not willing to suffer it all. Again, I'll have so much sympathy for them. Uh, the Germans of course also that you just have less sympathy for them. So, um, the, the British, you know, it took a while for us to get properly into the wall. I mean, even in the second we'll, we'll, uh, the, the phony war and then you know, that people were trying to get that. There was an appeasement movement in Britain right until Churchill took over. And Churchill, for all his faults was the walnut finally pinned the British into, into a post in Nazi Germany in the long term because they were elements in British society that we're perfectly happy to do a deal with it. Um, it, it, you know, it's a complex period, which I am not an expert on at all. Your latest

Speaker 2:          22:40          we'll call the last battle focuses on, you know, from a military history standpoint, I think one of the most fascinating periods in the first world war, but it seems to get lost in the burdens and the psalms and the passion Dales and all that. Talk a little bit about that era where we go away from the iconic western front of, of, of a stalemate on the front to open movement again and something that looks like a prototype for 1939 warfare.

Speaker 3:          23:09          It, it certainly is. Um, I mean, everything changes with the, the itch the allies come up with the alarms battle, which is basically finding all the different weapons, the artillery, the gas, the mass machine gun fire that tanks, the aeroplanes, that light machine guns, mortars, everything together, working together with, uh, to, to, to, to, to overwhelm anything that Germans do, took a breakthrough. But also it's the difference that not just attacking on one place, like at the summer pasture, but to attack for attacks, for battles for days. He Americans go first, that then, then the British and the Canadians then and then uh, the French, the Belgians and the British, and then finally the British again, and the French full battles for day is pushing the Germans. Now, the reason it's missed out and normally book's finished roundabout the eighth of August. My own book on 1918, a very British victory, which was a bit of a job title.

Speaker 3:          24:08          I have to admit, I don't know why I did that. I have got a sense of humor which does come out at a parcel really normally. And the point was that you sort of, you publish it. If they say right, we've had enough of them go to the top. Now we've had. And that's what you tend to miss out. Even that book by me, you know, Mrs the last six weeks of the war. And I wanted to put that right with this because there are so many enormous battles. Open warfare comes in. Open warfare is worse. The casualty figures get higher, much higher because because you're in the open, if something goes wrong, you know, hey, God is the British to go forward, push through in a very modern fashion, push through, ignore isolated pockets of resistance there'll be dealt with, but if you're an infantry soldier and you go past an isolated pocket of resistance, you'll get killed and the inmates will as well because they'll fire into your flanks.

Speaker 3:          25:02          Does she go by? So it's efficient militarily, but it leads to huge casualties. It's a painful time for the British and the Americans who are learning at the same time and anyone, anyone who has insults, the American, the courage of the American troops on a, in the Argon, those battles is mad because if you insult them, you're insulting the British on the Somme and you're insulting the French in 1914, you're insulting basically armies that don't know what's going to happen to them. They haven't had a chance to learn and that I think you don't learn this until you get right into the end of the war because the Americans don't really get into the war until, uh, until September about September the 26th. That's when their wall really starts when they attack the Argonne forest water place. You know, I've been there. It's murder, you know, you mentioned earlier and you just sort of opened the door to it again.

Speaker 3:          26:02          I'm one of the, one of the aspects, one of the opinions, one of the points of views on this subject that you're kind of known for, you know, I, I'd put you and I guess you would put yourself in the camp of those who look at, for example, the performance of the generals, which of course famously some compared to butchery to. If I could, I could sum it up maybe A. I'm doing pretty well considering what a natural learning curve on, on, on a big technological revolution in military affairs like this one might be a. is that fair to say that you think that they've done a pretty good job? All things considered spot on, particularly some of the more advanced French and British general and uh, I, I stand by, Hey, I, I know it makes me a puppet or in some places. The thing about Haig was he was don't think of him as a general thinking of him as a chief executive of a massive American Corporation.

Speaker 3:          26:54          Someone who, who provides direction, someone who brings things together. So who enables or makes things happen. If you think of him that way, you get in a much better idea of what he was. He was a commander in chief of five armies. There is no such thing as in, uh, in the, uh, Second World War. I mean, you know each. I mean, there people are supreme commanders, but they had people to deal with. Politicians have to deal with our allies. That doesn't happen in the first world war. It's just, hey, who has to deal with all of them and it, that's how it works. And they did come up and. But when it's not, Haig comes up with it, but it enables the system which allows the all arms battle to function. And can I just want, it's not a learning curve, what it is is too big, deepest side by side and once the allies or the British, if you were to look at it narrowly British or Americans and then the other side is the Germans and for every new attacking method you bring in the Germans bringing a defensive attitude.

Speaker 3:          27:54          It's not a curve. You go up and you go down and something that works on Tuesday, it might not work next Thursday because the Germans will have changed their tactics. That's an analogy. Not An exact timeframe obviously, but what I mean is it's constantly changing. So in 1951 trench line, perhaps one and a half. Then later in that year there's three trench lines. By the year afterwards, there's three trench systems and then readouts. Soon after that you start to get the pill is the underground block houses where the troops can be kept safe. You get different machine can tactics. So the Germans are constantly changing. Now we changed as well. British bringing tanks, are they great? Not First, but they're part of it that were different tactics, different infantry tactics. So both sides are changing, enhance. If you think of two big diapers, I think you call them something else in America, but you know a little right, well, lots going up and down hills at running side by side and you find out who's going to win a battle by where you are in relation to the other side.

Speaker 3:          28:58          Henson, the Psalm, first, Psalm, first day of the somme, 19th, six days were very low down there. They've got great trench systems, great weapons of defense. And we, we're, we're, we're, we're an, we don't know what we're doing, but all told by the end of the war, we really have learned to where the very high end we're looking down on the Germans. But it is a complex system that, that the, uh, I think, uh, Golden Corrigan, a British historian once said, it wasn't the generals killed up boys. It was the Germans and it's the same for your American lads. It's the Germans that did it. And when we try and blame just our generals or just our senior offices or blame our allies, you're not understanding what's happening. We're fighting a very complex war against the best army in the world, one of the biggest army in the world. The Germans

Speaker 2:          29:48          you wrote in your book that modern warfare was just so damn complicated at every level. Um, so let's talk about that for a minute because it seems to me and I, you know, obviously there were, there were earlier wars were, these changes happened, but so slowly that they may not have been important. It seems to me that the first world wars, the first one where we get that very modern sort of sense where technology is changing so quickly that it's not that you're going to have to learn the lessons of this war and adapt for the next war. You're going to have to learn the lessons of today's air combat, for example, so that in six months you have the newest discovery or the other side's gonna shoot your people out of the air. Now, in the Second World War you saw this, this, this dynamic going on all the time. What's the latest tank? What's the latest version of the airplane? But in the first world war, it seems like that's the first time that, that needing to learn on the fly and adapt during the conflict becomes, well a war winning or a war losing potentially thing.

Speaker 3:          30:45          Absolutely. And it's so quick. I mean, the aircraft that took place before the battle of the somme, the aircraft that took control of the air over the song were British and that there were things like the Idh to the uh, uh, you know, the, um, uh, the fee to be that the sopwith strutter by God, there were names to conjure with them camels 17. That's later. But they took control. They will outclass totally by the Albatross just three months later, three months now. People like me still think that the, uh, you know, the whole carrier, a decent aircraft, that's 19 fifties technology that flew in the sixties, seventies and eighties and has been outdated now. Best part of 10 years. Then it was months, just months. And you could be flying an aircraft that was great. And now he's useless. In fact, it's a death trap when you meet something better.

Speaker 3:          31:43          And, and I find, and I think that there is a warfare as a catalyst for change, you get generals or people like generals who defined the need and then you get to a scientist who, who do the thinking, who work out the theory of how to meet that need and then you have a, you know, you have the practical men that they're engineers are practical soldiers and they work at it to actually do it, you know, how to fix that camera to an airplane, you know, how to, you know, somebody else works at the focal lengths and everything else, but someone has to work it out. You get the theory of a synchronization machine so you can shoot through the propeller or not through the propeller if you see what I mean, that the theories very well and good, but you need practical mentor, make it work. And warfare drives along technological change. A bit like in the sixties, um, if I might, although it's not my subject a bit like the space race did the same, you know, driving along technological change because someone's defined a very real need.

Speaker 2:          32:48          Well, and then to bow tie this with what we just talked about and then somebody from the military hierarchy has to figure out how it all fits together operationally. And if you're the CEO, like you said, in a guy like Douglas Haig, you have to remember that it's a guy who has to factor in all this, what we would call today, high tech stuff. Who was a cavalry officer born in the mid 19th century.

Speaker 3:          33:10          Yep. He was a buddy. He was known as he educated soldier. He was saying, I mean, you read, you can find a quote for everything if you look through the thing, so you'll find, you know, but he was an enthusiast for machine guns eight to has a problem, a problem. He's often too keen on new weapons, uh, you know, he, um, he, uh, he, he doesn't realize that. Well, not that he doesn't realize, but sometimes he doesn't appreciate that, that, that you have to bed them in. There's no point building 300 tanks and sending them forward if you don't know how to drive them. Which we didn't in 1968. It's only 1917. We knew how they worked, how the, how to use them in action, how to fit them in, into the all arms battle, the what's going on is very, like, I may be a British term or it may be an American term that we used, but hey, you could not have recognized this term, but best practice, you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          34:03          Uh, all the time the British army is engaged in something called best practice. They wouldn't know what that meant, but they, they look at a battle, what worked, what didn't best practice. They then disseminate in a series of pamphlets called the SS unfortunately with our perspective, but ss pamphlets, a those pamphlets, how to do this, how to use a tank in battle, how to use a louis machine guns, how to make an attack, how to do this, how to do that. And this, this is just, you know, this is just the stuff of modern warfare and it takes staff officers. It takes generals and it takes someone like, Hey, get the top, uh, to, to, to co ordinate. He's not a genius. He's not the Polian. It's probably not even Wellington, but what he is is a driven individual who, who, whose mind for one reason is it's a perfect staff officer mind, a combination of detail Dr and the, the guts to set a direction, a direction which is painful to many of the men who served for it.

Speaker 2:          35:05          When you're reading the histories too, I mean, it's so funny because, and you'll churchill is a perfect example of someone who will push this, but you mentioned it with Hashtag to where you can see that the best way to use this new technology is to sort of surprise the other side with it and benefit from the shock value. But as you just pointed out, the problem is, is that you don't know how to use it until you've used it a few times. And then by then of course the Germans have started responding with countermeasures and whatnot. I mean, remember, uh, was it churchill talked about using the tanks when they first appeared in pin pricks as opposed to some giant battle where a thousand of them overwhelmed the front. But as you pointed out, if that was the first time you ever really employed them, would it have been effective at all?

Speaker 3:          35:48          That I'd like to take? Yes. That's a great exam because the 15th of September is the first tank attack. A three quarters of them broke. I'm rubbish at statistics. I'm not that kind of historic,

Speaker 3:          36:01          but let's just take the broad brush. Three quarters or two thirds of them broke down and never got to the front. They'd left gaps in the barrage, the creeping barrage which run forward in front of the infantry for the tanks when they weren't there, the infantry didn't have any artillery support. And in front of them they got lost. They had at the wheels because I thought they needed wheels at the back to steer them. They had no idea how to communicate between themselves and the infantry when they go into action. To be absolutely honest, there are several, several historians, a cynical historically think the tanks probably killed more British troops in German troops that day. Now that is more, uh, uh, uh, what we call an outlier. You know, it's more just a point, robin, the serious remark, but the point, what do you have the slightest how to use the tanks inaction and we didn't have until home bright now, which is, which is a 1978 in 1970 a year and a couple of months later, if we'd sent a thousand tanks as they were on the 15th to September 1916 over the top, it would have been. Sorry.

Speaker 2:          37:12          No, that's, that's okay. And we're getting some glitches on this end, which is not wonderful. Um, so talk to me, talk to me a little bit if you could, about the, the difference that for years has made by the time this book that you put out now. The last battle is focusing on this. The governments of all these countries are fundamentally transformed. I mean Russia, imperial, Russia has gone by this time, Austria, Hungary is shattered and looking for a way out of the war behind the scenes. You know, France has endured some serious troop morale problems in the not too distant past. And you know, that's traditionally like the finest army in the world and Britain has gone from the greatest creditor nation to one that is transferring their debt to New York. Now. What's the difference between the armies of 1914 in the governments that support them versus these armies of early 1918 and the governments that support and direct them?

Speaker 3:          38:07          Well, the non toll tina armies would have been recognizable by Napoleon. The tactics, the way that we used would have been recognizable from Napoleon from 100 years before they've got modern weapons, but they had no idea how to use the governments were old fashioned governments. I mean I know Britain best but so I'll use him as an example. Lloyd George is Berry Berry. Different prep from, from asquith. The who led the government asked with is not particularly competencies. Apply Towel gentlemen drinks far too much. Squiffy asquith. Lloyd George has many, many faults. In fact, I need a few more men to really encompasses many faults, but he is driven and you don't have to hate Lloyd George just because you like, hey, they would chalk and cheese, but they both did their bit. Lloyd George was a classic wall leader. He provided civilian direction. His idea of what to do with soldiers was madness and he. He did not help the direction of the war on a strategic level, but on a sort of global level. He provided the drive, but Britain was running out of money. It was running out of resources. It was running out of troops and and, and, and it was running out of time. The war had to be finished in 18 and that's one thing that hey, realized he was desperate to have finished the war, not to give the Germans and no other chance to provide, to dig another set of trench lines, shortened perhaps say from

Speaker 3:          39:39          because that's what they really hate and fear that they have to get them. The war finished.

Speaker 4:          39:46          Frank,

Speaker 3:          39:48          you had a revolution. We know that wasn't a revolution in France. We know there wasn't one in Britain, but they could have been and people were very aware of that.

Speaker 2:          39:59          Um, those governments that would have made it into 1919 if the war we're continuing might've had problems on the allied side too. Not just the, um, the, the central powers.

Speaker 3:          40:11          Oh, absolutely. Uh, uh, wall weariness. I mean it's just, you know, it was an incredible, uh, there was no money that now men, uh, everything's depressed. It, it's, it's just, you know, an awful thing to be involved in. Um, countries are struggling and we needed Lloyd George to provide the leadership at the center and, and the determination to fight on, to make sure that the would be beaten. I mean, it's so easy just to give up, uh, to just say, well, we'll come to some compromise, but the leaders like Lloyd George would not accept that.

Speaker 2:          40:51          I think that's everything. I mean, did I, is there something about the new book that I didn't ask you about that, that is worth pointing out? I mean, I, I'm with you. I find it not just fascinating, but it's a little like discovering that a band and you thought you'd heard every song from them had a whole bunch of songs you didn't know about and they're bigger and more interesting than you ever knew other than not being able to pronounce all of the battlefields and the wonderful. Isn't that wonderful? Last push in France. What about that last book have we not talked about that you think is. It is especially compelling.

Speaker 3:          41:23          I'll tell you what the thing for me is it's an emotional response, which I think you'll appreciate this. Just A. It's the essence of the book. If you've been fighting for years, say you're a soldier in those trenches you've been fighting for for years and just as start to think it's coming to an end, it's come into them and then you. You have to go forward. You have to go into the attack and not everybody do. You recognize her Second World War. It's called shell hole. Drop it. You can't all drop out. You know you can't all fall back. Keep keep behind. You just have to keep going with your mates and the temptation to shirk in those final attacks in the final days must have been enormous, but somehow most found from somewhere, the inner resolve which, which people are made just can't really grasp or understand because it's beyond our experience to finish the job.

Speaker 3:          42:19          Generally. It was the worst of all for that. And I'm not just saying this because you're American. First of all, as pershing forced the final attack on the, the, the night of the 10th, 11th, and even the morning of the 11th and, and you know, the Americans had nearly 3000 casualties. I'm rubbish on that final 24 hours and just imagine what was going through their heads when they were told. I mean the Marines who were told they had to cross the mers in a lead foot wide river, which Germans with machine guns on the other side and just, I mean, what went through their head and that's the last thing I'd like to say about just just put yourself there and think about it. That's why I liked your book so much because you do such a great job of giving me the chance to do that. Listen, we'll try to sell you a few books this time. I hope you'll come on the next time you have one and I hope you'll write a bunch more. Thank you very much. I'd love to. I've really enjoyed it. Thank you very. Had a great time with, like I said, meeting heroes. Take care. And thank you so much. Que Ca.

Speaker 1:          43:21          So again, my apologies for the, uh, digital glitches there. Uh, I will try to figure out a better method. I do want to encourage you, if you are a fan or interested in the first world war to get Mr Hartz books. The Great War is absolutely a classic. Is One on the naval battle of Jutland in 1916. Follows the same pattern with his, um, context punctuated by oral historian quotes. It works so well. Uh, he wrote one on passion Dale, um, which is, you know, as you know, probably awful, muddy, horrible, bloody symbolic of the whole war at that stage. And then the new book, of course, the last battle, which focuses on the less well known but murderous time period in the war and the phase of the first world war where everyone got into the trenches and started moving again and began to take the kinds of casualties that reminded them why they first dug into the ground in the first place.

Speaker 1:          44:17          Now, as an addendum, a couple of things worth noting. First of all, at the very end of the conversation with Mr Hart, he was talking about pershing and he was saying things like, you know, on the 10th or even on the 11th, you know, he was launching these offensives, uh, just a little explanation. The 10th and the 11th or the November 10th and November, 11th, 19, 18, the day before and the day of the end of the war, the armistice taking effect. Everybody knew that, you know, at this hour on this day, we're going to stop shooting. So everybody knew, okay, the war ends tomorrow, or the war ends today. So how much does it bother you as a soldier in the trenches? Well, maybe not even in the trenches at that point, leaning up against a broken down old French brick house in a ruined French building behind a tank as you're prepared to move forward to find out that your general wants to launch an offensive that's going to cost a lot of your lives in the last 24 hours of the war or something. So that's what he was talking about.

Speaker 1:          45:20          You might think in your head of reasons why a general might want to do something like that and play with your own motivations for a minute. Now, the other thing I wanted to quote was we had mentioned that in the beginning of his famous series on the Second World War, you can't even call it a history. You should call it almost like a personal account from a participant. Uh, but Churchill's history of the Second World War has a wonderful start to at where he kind of talks about. He sort of picks up at the end of the first world war, which when you think about it, it's not a bad way to write the histories. And he talks about, you know, the war ending, when it did, and what was going to happen if it didn't, right what, what the plan was for 19, 19, and of course the war ends in 1918, right?

Speaker 1:          46:08          But, but Churchill says, if 19, 19 happened, you know, it was going to unleash terrorists, unlike any of the world had ever seen Churchill writes quote. But all that happened in the four years of the Great War was only a prelude to what was preparing for the fifth year. The campaign of the year in 1919 would have witnessed an immense, a session to the powers of destruction of the Germans retain the morale to make good their retreat to the Rhine. They would have been assaulted in the summer of 1919 with forces and by methods in comparatively more prodigious than any yet employed. Thousands of airplanes would have shattered their cities. Scores of thousands of Canon would have blasted their front arrangements were being made to carry simultaneously a quarter of a million men together with all their requirements continuously forward across country in mechanical vehicles moving 10 or 15 miles each day. Poison gasses of incredible malignity against which only a secret mask which the Germans could not obtain in time was proof, would have stifled all resistance and paralyzed all life on the hostile front subjected to attack, no doubt the Germans to had their plans, but the hour of wrath had passed. The signal of relief was given and the horrors of 1919 remain buried in the archives of the great antagonists and quote,

Speaker 1:          47:36          and it's worth pointing out that even with the terrible and horrible destruction of the Second World War, there were some of the horrors of the first that we're not revisited, which seems counterintuitive to human history, doesn't it? This idea that in total war, human beings would use every single weapon at their disposal to fend off total destruction. Yet those leaders in the Second World War who themselves were younger people who fought in the first and we experienced that somehow managed to not use poison gas again on a wide scale, for example. I don't know what conclusions you can draw from that, but it's an interesting variable to consider, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          48:24          Finally, we had mentioned a, a, a note specifically that it's stuck in my mind and it obviously stuck in I'm Peter Hearts buying to from a soldier that was writing his turns out to be last note home to his family and it exemplifies the way heart tends to work where he will write a piece that sets up this emotional, an exclamation point and then deliver it to you. And it just stayed. We used it blueprint for armageddon because it is so emotionally powerful. So here's what heart rights he's talking about this battle at the song which he referenced in the interview, that terrible British day where they've figured out, oh my gosh, you know, this isn't working the way we thought, and meanwhile we're trying to figure it out in the open, under machine gun fire, behind a lot of barbed wire. And he says that the soldiers about to go on this attack would write these letters home to their families

Speaker 1:          49:21          and here's what he says. And then he quotes the powerful letter. He says, and this is from his book, the Great War, by the way, quote, the final reports from the front, meaning of the Somme battle that filtered back to the British high command, were generally positive in tone. Overall, the visual impression of the barrage proved far more devastating than the truth on the ground. British progress had been more than discounted by German improvements in their defenses, but that was not known at the time on the British side of the wire. In any case, they had no choice. The offensive had to go ahead is the future of the alliance with France dependent on it in the last few hours as Hague's men prepared for the ordeal. Many wrote their sad last letters. Home one was so beautifully expressed that it exemplifies the feelings of men trapped and tormented by the conflicting calls of country and family.

Speaker 1:          50:13          Now he's quoting an original letter quote, I must not allow myself to dwell on the personal. There's no room for it here. Also, it is demoralizing, but I do not want to die. Not that I mind for myself. If it'd be that I am to go, I'm ready, but the thought that I may never see you or are darling baby again turns my bowels to water. I cannot think of it with even the semblance of equanimity. My one constellation is the happiness that has been ours. Also, my conscience is clear that I've always tried to make life a joy to you. I know at least that if I go he will not want. That is something, but it is the thought that we may be cut off from one another which is so terrible and that our baby may grow up without my knowing her and without her knowing me.

Speaker 1:          51:03          It is difficult to face and I know your life without me would be a dull blank. You must never let it become holy. So for two, you will be left the greatest charge and all the world, the upbringing of our baby. God blessed that child. She's the hope of life to me. My darling are for. It may be that you will only have to read these lines as one of passing interest. On the other hand, they may well be my last message to you if they are no throw all your life that I've loved you and baby with all my heart and soul that you to sweet things were just all the world to me. I pray, God that I may do my duty for I know whatever that may entail, you would not have it otherwise, and to quote Captain Charles, May Twenty Second Manchester Regiment and then Peter Harte writes quote Charles May, the loving husband of Bessie Mae and the father to his baby, pauline would indeed be killed. The next day he's buried in the dancing ally, British cemetery, small scale tragedies. He writes, litter, the history of war, sad reminders that the necessities of war ruined the lives of millions and the quote that ladies and gentlemen is an art form. My thanks to Peter Hart for talking with us today and listened down the road. If we're lucky, we'll get to do it again.

Speaker 1:          52:35          We've been telling you about audible for years. Obviously audio books and a whole lot more. If you haven't discovered the joys of audio books, there's elements to it that I think are going to develop that I already find fascinating. Take the element of whose voice it is reading to you, something you don't consider. When you think about getting a book. Is it, I mean, who's the narrator? I mean, I imagine one day you're going to be able to customize this with some sort of button, you know, with your favorite movie star. I went Michael Caine narrating today's book and it'll all come out that way, but I was looking for recommendations for today's a particular little discussion. And uh, Peter Hart, who we just talked to has a couple of books on audible, but they're narrated by different people. And so I'm sampling them going, okay, do I want Peter Hart's spoke on the Somme in this voice.

Speaker 1:          53:22          You're doing what Peter Hearts, other book on the Somme in other voice. And it's interesting because it's an element. You don't think about this, a performance aspect to it. It's one of the things to like about audio books as you get to Kinda, you know, have different people read to you in different voices, decide what you like. And like I said, some day I imagine this will be quite customizable. Audio books of course been around a long time. So has auto. We've been telling you about them for years. They've been supporting us. Um, and we've watched as they have, you know, sort of rolled out more and more features to what they do. I mean, one of the things we've talked about that's great about audible, you know, you sign up to audible, you get points, you get a book that's free every month. I mean it's one of those membership type services, but there's things that they just do, right?

Speaker 1:          54:06          I mean they roll over, you know, your points kind of. So if you don't get a book this month while those points accrue, so the, you know, you have more next month. He owned the books, which I love. It is so weird to me to purchase something and then realize, wait a minute, if you read the fine print, you don't. Actually own this, you own these books. If I'm going to buy something like this, I want to own it. I need a big selection too, and audibles got one that carry titles in business, the classics, fiction history, Romance, mystery, thriller, Sci Fi, fantasy, self-development kids, and yeah, I mean, you know like a bookstore, right? When I was younger, if you liked audio books, you got to go to the library and see what they had available on cassette tapes. Now when a new book comes out and hits the bookstores, digital and brick and mortar, I'm audible usually has the two.

Speaker 1:          54:59          That's a sign of the popularity of these things and why not? It allows you to read a good book, to motivate yourself, educate yourself, entertain yourself, make yourself more successful and inspired while you're doing some other chore that Does Not Require Your full attention. You got to mow the lawn. Well, maybe you can, you know, get one of those classic books, read at the same time, got an iron sheets. Well, why can't you be enjoying a romance novel at the same time? You get where I'm coming with this. Busy people are consuming books at rates that well when you consider how busy they are, they shouldn't be able to find the time to do that. Audio books fill a void and audibles the best place to get them. And if you sign up today, you can get a free audiobook with a 30 day trial membership.

Speaker 1:          55:46          Go to audible.com, forward slash Carlin, and browse the unmatched selection of audio programs. You can download a title, start listening. It's that easy. Go to audible.com, forward slash Carlin or texts Carlin to 500 dash 500 and get started today. If you don't know what to get, I recommend Peter Hearts two books on the somme. The newer one probably has more updated information. The official title of that is the Psalm, the darkest hour on the western front, but he's got an earlier book on the Somme also on audible, narrated by an English gentleman. I believe his name is pronounced. Uh, Tim Pickets Smith. And to me it sounds like Peter Hearts

Speaker 2:          56:24          actually reading the, the book. So the newer book probably has the newer information, but if you really want to have somebody reading to you that sounds more like the author get the earlier book. The good news is they're both available on audible and if you can't decide, feel free to buy them both. Sure. They older hardcore history shows can be a bit traumatic with titles like death throes of the republic judgment had been a va and addicted to bondage. We just consider that truth in advertising.
