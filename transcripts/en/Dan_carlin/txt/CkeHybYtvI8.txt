Speaker 1:          00:00:02       It's hardcore history,

Speaker 1:          00:00:07       I've always said some of the best things we do around here, our apologies, and so I want to apologize if it seems as though our subject matter and um, and the stuff we're talking about lately all kind of falls into a narrow sort of subject matter or a historical period. It's mostly been 20th century stuff. It's not by design, but I don't work by design. I work on inspiration and sometimes opportunity for example, the opportunity to get a guest like the one we have today. So things don't always work out in a balanced sort of way. What'll probably happen is that we'll end up flipping at a certain point and then I'll start getting emails from people saying, why do you never talk about 20th century stuff? So we're just probably balancing things out in the other direction. I'm going to talk to her. Max Hastings today. Those of you who like military history, uh, have certainly read his work. He's fantastic. You wrote inferno, he wrote a lot of other books. If you look at his resume as it exists now, well if you had shown that to me when I was 21 years old, I would have said, oh, that's the guy I want to be

Speaker 1:          00:01:10       his resumes long as heck. I mean foreign correspondent for the BBC editor in Chief of the Daily Telegraph, editor of the evening standard, a war correspondent. I'm author, prolific author, all around, interesting person and he's written a new book on Vietnam and 800 pages. By the way, I mean, it's a tome at the same time, you know, if your library is like mine and you like having certain subjects covered, uh, this is a necessary thing on my Vietnam section for any number of reasons.

Speaker 1:          00:01:49       Hastings has a connection to the war. He was a war correspondent in it and it was sort of where he made his bones as a young guy. Go Google him and look at the images of him when he was there. And my wife thought he looked like a beetle war correspondents are an interesting species. They don't make them like they used to, I should say, but at the same time there are still some good ones. They sort of have a foot in both worlds. The soldier world and the civilian world here of people that maybe don't know war at all, and so somehow you need to be able to translate things into a language where you can, you know, reliably convey information so that they can understand it. There's no way to reliably transmit information on what it's like to see a disemboweled village chief who's had his stomach cut out in front of the villagers by the Viet Cong as a lesson not to cooperate with the Americans or the South Vietnamese.

Speaker 1:          00:02:49       How do you, how do you even relate that in a way that people can understand and in a way where they just don't not read about it. At a certain point, if you get graphic enough, people won't read about it, but then you haven't done. You're supposed to do as a war correspondent now. Just so you know, it's only personal weakness. That probably kept me from doing something like that. I started reading because I was enamored with it. I'm all this stuff written and sometimes written about their own lives that these war correspondents had put into print and at a certain point you start to realize, wait a minute, do you really want to live with the memories these guys have? And they're sort of warning you sometimes when you read their books. I mean they're telling you what they're dreaming about at night. You deliberately over and over and over again go to places where awful, awful things have happened. Things soldiers see, by the way, although they don't often want to be there when it happens, the war correspondent, you know, to them that's like the story, right? Let's go to the bad place. Now. Most of the soldiers are of the opinion that they don't want to go to the bad place. They don't want to be there.

Speaker 1:          00:03:48       So Max Hastings did this job, which always for me, makes an interesting read because he's filtering in real personal experiences, tastes, smells, the lifestyle, the culture at the time that you just can't get researching secondhand sources. It would have been a very different book of Dan Carlin had written it from other people's stuff than to have a guy who was there who participated in the activities, who interacted with all the people and then has had decades and decades to see how history played out since and to think about it and to sort of integrate it into his overall worldview. The result is this new book and it's worth picking up if you have interest or you know a lot of you, I know the Vietnam section on your shelf. If you wanted to say what the focus of the book is, I think it's rightly put where it should be. Although it covers everything. That's the hardcore history books. I mean, you know, the godlike view, the hindsight view, the leadership view, the mid level view, the hamlet view, the, the what it's like to be the guy on the ground view, which is why you get 800 pages or 26. Our hardcore history series in the first world war. Either way it's like it's explainable, you know, understandable.

Speaker 1:          00:04:56       The most interesting part to me since I already know the battle stuff, although if you're into the battle stuff, he's awesome. Historically, he's awesome. Um, the most interesting thing for me though is to see how he can synthesize all this stuff that's happened in the decades since that era. I was born in 1965, 1960. I was born by the way on, on the one of the worst battles of the war, the one that made the movie about, that's my birthday. November 14th, nine 65 battle of the I valley. Um, but when I was a kid just starting to become aware, you know, the older brothers and those people who were the ones being drafted who were living through all this stuff. So in the 19 seventies it was, it's hard to explain. This was a transition period in US history. So this is what I want this introduction to Max Hastings, Sir Max Hastings interview to be.

Speaker 1:          00:05:42       Let me sort of cover the bases again for those who weren't there and try to set up a little of this and, and, and let you know why it's important to you. And why it matters in history, in this case, there is a before and after in us history and we all know there are several, right? You've got before, after the civil war is a classic one for people to use before and after the Vietnam era, go look at a photograph of Americans will just choose a big city because there was a lot of continuity in some of the less big cities where people look the same over the decades, right? They, they are more conservative, change, less slowly, less flashy, more down to earth people. But you get some photos from an la, Chicago, Miami, New York, some of the hip places supposedly. And you show a photo from 1963 and you compare those same people in a photo in 1973.

Speaker 1:          00:06:30       And you don't even have to say another word. You know, that the culture has totally changed. The Vietnam War is one of the major factor points that account for this. And there's several and they're much talked about it. A birth control pill. The sexual revolution, uh, music, I mean just there, there's a number of major factors, but without the Vietnam war you might not have any of those things. It's one of the prime movers and as a friend of mine who was at the protest back in the day pointed out and the prime mover was the fact that many people might have to go and suffer in a war that they really didn't want to be a part of that tends to concentrate the mind in a way that just some ideological cause wouldn't that prime mover pushed forward a lot of the era's change in the Zeit geist for lack of a better phrase.

Speaker 1:          00:07:16       I know that's kind of strange change in the guys, but I mean the rape culture flipped now, once again, not in some places the American heartland was remarkably consistent, but in many places and in terms of what Madison Avenue is feeding you and we're Hollywood's feeding you and all that stuff, the culture really changed. Vietnam is an important point in that it was also an era of extreme disillusion with the government. It's hard to explain once again how different Americans were before Vietnam and after if I just said, we believed our government, that right there is hard to square. It's so far beyond what most people today are raised with and it wasn't just you believed the person in your party in general, Democrats and Republicans believed the president. It didn't matter who the president was, you didn't think your government lied to you. Now that's naive of course, but maybe if you look at us history as equivalent to a person growing up, maybe you're still in your dumb teens in that era as a country and learning some of these hard lessons like you know in power politics, people lie.

Speaker 1:          00:08:23       The problem is though, is that you ended up with something called a credibility gap where the president had lied so many times that the American people weren't buying it at all. Maybe if you had returned to some level of perceived because it was always happening, some perceived normalcy with the next president of Americans could have had their faith in the honesty of government restored. But then you had Richard Nixon after Lyndon Johnson. So, I mean, that's like being hit with a left and a right. Lyndon Johnson would probably, you know, hooky and an upper cut, you and Richard Nixon would hit you below the belt, whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       But as a country, the seventies was about sort of reevaluating a lot of the things Americans had taken for granted in terms of our self image and whatnot. It's hard to describe how lone ranger ish we felt at the time period, how, you know Philip Caputo in, um, well he, he, he was the veteran who wrote rumor of war, but he's quoted in supermax hastings new book too. Um, let me read it to you. He sort of describes the way Americans felt about themselves. Or remember this is in the Post Second World War era where the US is just in our own minds. We saved Europe twice. Then we rebuilt it with our own tax dollars. Then we protected it from the Soviet Union and Communism and the Cold War. I mean, we were. The good guys have history. Hastings writes about Phil Kaputo quote, Lieutenant Kaputo like General Westmoreland saw himself fulfilling the vision of John f Kennedy Kaputo then says, quote, if he was the king of camelot than we were his knights and Vietnam, our crusade, there was nothing we could not do because we were Americans and for the same reason, whatever we did was right and quote, their communist photos were quote the new barbarians who menace the far flung interests of the new Rome and to quote,

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       but it's hard to describe how the United States saw itself as and the people, especially in the marketing materials as this force of good around the world and with this dominance during the second world war gave the United States a dominance that lasted for 15, 20 years in terms of of a headstart over a broken world and the power that that gave you made you feel almost a responsibility to do something good with it. In his book, Sir Max Hastings writes, quote, there was in the US and enormous self confidence and pride, not unlike that of the Germans before 19, 14, a consciousness of national greatness seeking an outlet, a searching for an appropriate challenge to their powers and refusal to believe that any problem was beyond their capacity to solve statesmen who might themselves have doubts were conscious of a great ground swell of public opinion bearing them on and quote.

Speaker 1:          00:11:18       This was the era where John F Kennedy was saying, you know, we will bear any burden for the success of liberty, the sacrificing that the country was willing to make. It was the era where young people were motivated by a sense of idealism that in some cases lead people to go to other countries and build, you know, farms and chicken coops and his work in the Peace Corps to others who saw a similar sort of mission to help people, especially poor people in undeveloped countries who needed it. By giving them a government that was free. So you see this idealism amongst all of these people across a wide spectrum of types. Now, as far as background in the war, so we have some context here. I didn't go into this with a Somax Max because you know, let's not deal with the stuff we can all find out beforehand, but the Vietnam war, as many of you know, is something that grows out of colonialism. It was one of those territories that a colonial power from Europe, in this case, the French, a controlled. It was French Indochina. They treated it the way that colonial powers usually treat these places. Puppets, they were bringing civilization was the line, but truthfully, I mean it was a bunch of French people in Nice hotels with Vietnamese waiters and whatnot.

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       That doesn't mean that there weren't people that liked it in Vietnam, but when the Second World War was over and you know, the anti colonialism wave was unleashed across the world. Vietnam fell into a pattern of a lot of other places that we're trying to throw off the yoke of their colonial masters. And in the case of Vietnam, there was a war before the American version of the Vietnam War for a long time. A very bloody nasty, dirty war between the French and what were called the Viet Minh. It was sometime during this period where the ideas of fighting for Vietnam nationalism, you know, the, the, the nation state a free Vietnam for Vietnamese run by Vietnamese. Um, at some point there are communists who become part of that movement are always part of it. And so there's this connection between these, these militant nationalist Vietnamese movements and communism. And this will be a poison pill for countries like the United States throughout the later

Speaker 1:          00:13:40       part of this conflict because when the Vietnamese eventually, after some nasty, nasty battles are able to win their independence from the French, the United States has already gotten their toe in the water in that region. Not because they really want the French to be the colonial masters anymore. But because of that worry over communism. And that's another thing that's hard to describe to people today is the role that the fear of communism played in all the decision making and all the calculations. Vietnam was just one of the many countries that was supposedly part of the domino effect where you might say to yourself, as many Americans did, they didn't know what Vietnam was. They couldn't pronounce it, they couldn't find it on a map, so why do we have to send our boys on our money to go fight and die there? Well, here's what happens, and remember, this isn't Malarkey.

Speaker 1:          00:14:29       The people who are spouting it generally believe it, but this is just another country that will be toppled by the communists and then that country will be consolidated and start to try to topple the person next door. The French had a different analogy. They didn't use dominoes. They they, they use bowling pins, but the idea and the image is the same, right? It's A. It's a toppling from one another to another and eventually you'll have the Soviet Union. In Mexico there were a lot of problems. It turns out in hastings is book as good at pointing this out. There were a lot of problems in the decision makers understanding of all this, which in hindsight seems crazy because when you look at how many people would die and all these wars and how many would be killed. Hastings book focuses on the civilians more than anything and, and rightly so, I think, um, but when you see all of that, you yearn for a reason and you yearn for just wanting to believe that the people who are making the decisions are at least well informed that they've gotten the experts, that they, they've got people explaining to them, well, let me explain the difference between Soviet communism in Chinese communism and the relationship of, of Vietnam to either of those, I mean that, that was already in some cases below where the threshold where anybody was paying attention and for much of this conflict and for others during this time period, there's this belief that Moscow controls everything in the communist world and that just wasn't true.

Speaker 1:          00:15:56       But if that's something you're basing all your decision making on, well it's no wonder that things worked out the way they did. Sometimes. I mean, there were occasions where our government just thought the other side was being stubborn when in reality we were talking to the people who had no control over the events we wanted to influence and we didn't even know it. It's hard to believe you could have such momentous decisions regularly made with such either bad intelligence or lack of understanding, but let's be honest, this is one of the things that waiting a couple of decades or in this case five decades after the events so that makes clear you have a chance and another thing, hastings, because very good at you have a chance to get the other side's point of view to interview those people. I'm considering that we're starting to lose that generation.

Speaker 1:          00:16:45       Just like the Second World War generation hastings is booked, might turn out to be one of those really important things on a shelf for a very long time because you can't replicate those discussions he had with the principals. Nevertheless, if you remember this period, you remember that part of the problem, you know, in terms of our good guy image to ourselves was some of the news that was coming out of this place and what ended up happening in a nutshell is something that you see happen in a lot of other places. You saw it with the French in their war in North Africa, right? In places like Algeria in the 19 fifties where it becomes a dirty war when you have civilians carrying bombs and kids throwing grenades into restaurants and people hiding. I mean, it's difficult after a while to keep your troops from doing the sorts of things that the folks back home imagine that their troops don't do.

Speaker 1:          00:17:36       In the case of the United States, things happen in the Vietnam War. That if you had gone back a mere 15, 16, 17 years before and asked the American public whether anything like this was ever possible from American soldiers, they would have denied to high heaven the Mee Lai massacre, for example. But there was regular bad stuff going on. I mean, if you're going to proclaim something like a free fire zone, which of course in Vietnam was famous, which means that anyone you see in this area is considered a bad person by default. Well, it's not going to be a good tally at the end of the year when you start trying to figure out how many actual enemy you killed versus how many people who just got in the way wrong place at the wrong time and that became another problem with the war. The war had very many. There were constraints on the war and the constraints are things that we still talk about today because it was the cold war and because people had nuclear weapons and because the Soviet Union and the Chinese were on the other side and because we had just fought a sort of an undeclared will, really undeclared war that started against Korea, but ended up being American troops and Chinese troops killing each other.

Speaker 1:          00:18:48       The last thing that anybody wanted was another one of those, so there was always an attempt to keep the war confined to certain parameters. Imagine you've got this fire burning and you just want to make sure that the fire doesn't spread, but at all times any conflict, especially one going on as long as the Vietnam war did is a potential flash point in world war three and let's remember as bad as Vietnam was, imagine how bad something like that could have been if it became the equivalent of, you know, Gavrilo Princip shooting an archduke in Sarajevo in 1914. We wouldn't be talking about two or 3 million Vietnamese civilians dying in this war. We would be talking about 100, 200 million people and us still clearing out the ashes today. So let's try to remember the, the, the big picture that the leaders in this story are trying to juggle it all times. So you have lack of good information with nuclear weapons as your punishment if you screw up. No pressure there. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       But the 19 seventies were about coming to some sort of emotional terms with this and then there's those of us who lived through it, it's almost not worth talking about because we remember it so well and it was so. I mean, it was beaten to death by the end, let's be honest, but new generations coming up, don't remember any of this. It was a very different postwar world for the veterans who came back from Vietnam because this was a war we lost and Americans. I can again say from experience, we used to be very proud of the fact that you could say we never lost a war. You Canadians do not need to write me about the war of 18, 12. I realized that that's a eye of the beholder issue a little bit and I don't want to get into a couple of others with you, but you know, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:20:33       Theoretically, kind of sort of, you know, in our own minds, we never lost a war. Vietnam was hard to deny. Vietnam also broke the army for a while and this is a a point that's well understood. If you read about this kind of stuff that's not talked about a lot, what it did to the US army between let's just say 65 and 70 was amazing. Again, something you wouldn't have thought could happen to an American army, but then it hadn't been put in that kind of situation before. As we said, look at the French. In Algeria, you find yourselves in these kinds of situations and all of a sudden it's a little bit different. You had drug abuse, you add the short tour of duty. There were a lot of things. The army really looked at a lot of things after the war to try to figure out what had happened and if you're interested in that subject.

Speaker 1:          00:21:19       By the way, Andrew j Bacevich has written several books. I'm describing the rebuilding of the US military after Vietnam and what was required and the safeguards that the military brass tried to put into place to keep the civilians from ever putting them in. That situation again, didn't work, but there were safeguards put into A. Colin Powell is written about this too and he was involved in some of this stuff, but people don't talk about that very much for the. You know, you could look at the American army in 1973 who and that's from the Vietnam War and it wasn't just, you know, the, the morale and whatnot. I mean, there was um, a real, I mean fragging was something that was talked about a lot and you know what fragging is, right? The shooting of your own officers or the, you know, you throw a grenade at them when no one's looking.

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       We were fragging our officers sometimes you don't find a lot of that from the Second World War, but in the Second World War we had a very different kind of us image. And the thing about the images, you kind of live up to that where you try to write. So you just stayed away. Americans don't do this. It became hard to say Americans don't do this. After Vietnam. It was, it was the war that proved that we were human, right? We were, we, we were as good guys as we tried to be, but we were human. Anybody who goes back and dives deep into things like the Filipino insurrection or, you know, some of the native American war, certainly, uh, we've proven this point before in us history. Nonetheless. You kind of need to relearn it every generation or two. It seems

Speaker 1:          00:22:55       one of the other things hastings focuses on and I think it's, it's an excellent point is how bad the other side was there. His, as he said, a little self flagellation on the part of Americans. But he was a hard thing for us to absorb. I mean, it's a huge deal. Uh, the country was, was wrestling with huge issues in the 19 seventies to early 19 eighties about this. I was, um, I was in, uh, one of the early courses and 60 minutes did a whole big thing on this because it was groundbreaking at the time that undergraduates were taking it at universities where the Vietnam War was on the curriculum. And one of the things that they would do is bring in these veterans to talk to you, you know, in every class. So I took one of the University of Colorado and we had a veteran who sat in the back of the class and we didn't know he was a veteran because these guys were like 32 or 33 years old when they were talking to her class and sat in the back, the classroom the whole time and then like after eight weeks or something, stood up and said, I've been watching this whole class as part of my recovery.

Speaker 1:          00:23:50       I'm trying to come to grips with all this. We actually showed a movie in the class that showed a helicopter door gunner and he said, that movie showed me. I was the helicopter door gunner you saw in that film, boom. But we, we're all wrestling with things back back then and it's hard to describe to a generation now who grows up in an era where no one ever believes their government. And that's just the right way to be by the way. And the United States is fully seen as a, basically a good guy, but fully fallible. I'm fallible. Part was not something that people thought of say in the early 19 sixties. We were a force for good only in our minds and so it was this huge mental rearrangement in the seventies. If you look at the material, I mean there was a lot of introspection and it wasn't just introspection amongst the general population, but the military also and the political class when we eventually, I believe, was it Panama, like 1989 or something.

Speaker 1:          00:24:50       When that happened, I think President Bush, the first had said something like, you know, we finally kicked the Vietnam Syndrome or whatnot, and the Vietnam Syndrome was the, the after effect where all of a sudden the United States didn't want to go and mess with other countries for awhile. We'd had enough of that for a while. It wasn't just, um, the, the soldiers who had died and were willing to do, or the veterans who were increasingly showing signs of being a badly effected by what happened to them in the war. But the cost and the blow back and there was just this feeling for a while, no more. But again, time passes and people change and you forget just how bad it can be when things go wrong. And make no mistake about it, things went wrong in Vietnam. The idea that the United States of America after the Second World War were still at this pinnacle of of industrial might and military power.

Speaker 1:          00:25:43       The idea that a bunch of backward gorillas in what we called a third world country with no money and no, I mean they've got no. There's, there's nothing that they could beat us that right there was a hard pill to swallow, but it reminded military and political leaders once again, that war is not disconnected from politics as Clausewitz so famously said, and what you're really after in any of these situations is a political settlement or a political change. If your enemy or your adversary or your opponent does not give in when you beat the hell out of them and give you what you want politically, you don't. When the United States did not lose a major encounter in the Vietnam war, and the bigger the encounter, the more likely the United States one and one big, one of the most famous. Most Americans that know anything about this war. I have heard the words Tet offensive before it was a famous Vietnamese northern Vietnamese attack in many places at once. That was a disaster for them, but it was not portrayed that way at the time. I remember one veteran explaining to me just how unbelievable the casualties were that the north Vietnamese and Viet Cong suffered in that offensive, but it wasn't about body counts.

Speaker 1:          00:27:04       They weren't fighting a war for body counts. They were fighting a war for a political settlement and because the United States had lied to it's people so often about how the war was going, what the other side did by sacrificing a ton of their people and material was say, Hey, war's not over. And at the same time, basically demonstrate to everyone that what they'd been told was false, which turned the people once more against the political regime. If you're in, if you're, if you think about this, I hate to do this because it's, it's, um, there's no respect. I mean, it just, it seems wrong. But if you think about it like a game and you're playing one side or the other, it's fascinating to see how if you get to be the north Vietnamese communists side in this, how, how little you have to play with in terms of real pieces that have any power, the other side's got all the good pieces and yet there's ways to win without them and that's what I mean. The guy when I was growing up as guys in black pajamas beat the US military incomprehensible,

Speaker 1:          00:28:07       but an entire generation of military personnel who were mostly junior officers in that war would grow up to influence the way the US military developed 10, 15, 20, 25 years and now all the way to now in the footprints of Vietnam are all over this military. It's back mostly. And while it would be sort of outside the norms of human history to expect us not to make the same mistakes, they certainly changed a bunch of things so that, well, this war will never be lost in America's living rooms. Again. As the old saying was, it's astounding and I'll wrap it up. So to hear when you, when you listen to, or Max Hastings as a war correspondent, the kind of freedom that they had to cover that war. And it was a weird situation because if you look at press coverage in the second world war and Korea, it's highly regulated and censored. So then the next big war after Korea, Korea ends in what? Fifty one, 52. The next big war starts ramping up 63, 64 in Vietnam with a lot of advisors. I mean who has 16,500 at one point before the real troops came in. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:29:17       the media all of a sudden doesn't have those constraints for really the first time in modern American history certainly. And they seem to get less and less constrained as the war goes on. And when you see some of these, there's one famous firefight where the reporter is what? I think it's during tet, where the reporter walks up to US troops that are, um, at a wall I think may be marines that are a wall and they are fighting something right on the other side of the wall. And they are reloading their weapons and then standing up and shooting at the other side of the wall and the reporter walks right up and starts interviewing. The guy is, he's reloading is gun during the firefight. Now two things stand out at you right there. Number one is that's a ballsy reporter, right? That's a war correspondent of the sort that are just, they're amazing, right?

Speaker 1:          00:30:02       I've always had an admiration for their willingness to go get the story when they go get the story like that. I don't mean Ernie pyle was killed by a sniper machine gun. I think actually, um, you know, covering the Second World War. But the other thing you realize is that, that is absolutely uncensored work content coming right back to America's living rooms. And if I recall going from memory here, when the reporter asked the soldier something like, you know, what did he want to reach? I want to get outta here. You know what I mean? It was one of these, I just want to get out of here. I just want to get. I mean, it was not a pro war Rah Rah Rah thing. It was something that the folks at home would go, oh my goodness, now here's two sides to this, um, side number one is that's reality and please put me firmly in the camp of, you know, if you're going to go to these wars and you can expect people to support them, they have to know what it is and they have to know what it is in living color just like that.

Speaker 1:          00:30:52       So I'm on that side, but let's understand that the other side is Max Hastings points out in this book didn't show their people that kind of press coverage, right? So they're rigidly controlling what the communist people see. They don't get to see all their death or their suffering all their atrocities and the other side's got it in living color. And our friends who don't like us so much, there were some countries that love hate relationships. So do they play this stuff up? Huge. And you'll notice we didn't have Americans doing much protesting during the second world war. We were bombing Germany and Japan and we haven't had by Vietnam standards much in the way of those things since Vietnam. We had a few big ones, but you know, nothing's to stain Vietnam, the sustained pressure with lots and lots of people protesting for long time. I haven't had that sense either.

Speaker 1:          00:31:39       Could you suggest that maybe it's because they aren't being exposed to the same sort of a video and photos and stories that the American people saw in the 1960 [inaudible] and 19 seventies? Well, if so, and you can call that one of the, I guess successful reforms that the army and Navy and Marine Corp leaders, the Air Force leader is learned from that era. If they believed that the war was lost in the living room. Well, don't do that again and we don't. But back in supermax Max Hastings Day, we did. So I'm pleased to introduce, if you've never heard him, well my goodness, if you never read his books, if you're a military history fan, well then you have a whole bunch to pick up. I mean, in Ferno, go get in front of. That's a good one. But this latest one of Vietnam also. Fantastic. Uh, so without further ado, uh, I'm honored to talk to Sir Max Hastings today about his new book, Vietnam.

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       Hello, Max?

Speaker 3:          00:32:43       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:32:45       listen, thank you so much. I'm sure they've got you on the book, publicity, a factory assembly line to. We'll try to make this as painless and fun as possible.

Speaker 3:          00:32:54       It'll be completely painless.

Speaker 2:          00:32:57       Oh, I'm a big fan actually. Um, I will admit though, I haven't gotten through the latest book. I didn't get it in time. I'm enjoying it immensely though, and it's a subject near and dear to my heart as all Americans and in my generation probably had no way to avoid. Um, I was born during the battle of the, uh, of the. I drank valley, so November 14th, 1965. I'm 52.

Speaker 3:          00:33:20       Oh, well that makes you a generation younger than me.

Speaker 2:          00:33:23       Well, listen, I want, and I want to talk about that a little bit. It's fascinating to read something from a 21st century perspective that I actually grew up in, in the wake or the wash of a. and I was wondering, how different is this book from something you would have written much more closer to the time you were in country now, for example, the audience doesn't know this. Let me make sure that they do. Um, this is a book from a British perspective, which we don't normally get with Vietnam war books. Uh, it's also, um, it's also able to, as I said, give us a 21st century, look back at something that many of the books I was reading were written in the 19 eighties for example. And you were actually there. So, so give me a perspective a little bit on how writing this book now was different than, than how the 25 or 28 year old, Sir Max Hastings would have written it.

Speaker 3:          00:34:18       Stupid officer back in the 19 sixties. Although I'm British America and its history has been deeply etched into my own experience because I lived here in [inaudible] 67 or 68. Uh, and I witnessed up the huge demonstrations. Um, I met a lot of the key players of the Robert Kennedy's, the Eugene McCarthy is, um, and I went the White House and listened to Lyndon Johnson haranguing, a group of US foreign journalists about up, about why he was so passionate and committed to the war. And this was in January 1968. And of course we were hugely impressed to be meeting the president. That was me, 22 years old sitting in the cabinet role. Um, Johnson. He behaved in many ways, quite like his character to in the dea. Started out by saying saying, uh, some of you may like blondes and some who may like redheads and some of you may not like women at all, but I'm here this morning to tell you what kind I like.

Speaker 3:          00:35:19       He said, I'm prepared to sit down with Holcim in a nice hotel with nice food and sit down to talk to settle this thing. And he spoke for 40 minutes and then he got up and he didn't take questions, you said. Right. Very nice to meet you. Already went out the room. But then suddenly, just as we were gathering together all notes and we'd been hugely impressed those how could we not be. I'm an I was by far the youngest of the group, but nonetheless we were all quite a young group and meeting the president of the United States. But suddenly he put his head round the door again. I'm a little bit sheepishly and he came back in and he said, before you all go, I'd like to ask your one question meeting me. Have any of you changed your minds about anything you've read or heard about maybe before you came?

Speaker 3:          00:36:03       And we were absolutely stunned into silence by spectacle as the president of United States. I'm carrying six months what a load of kids like us thought. But that was a reflection of how vulnerable Johnson felt that. And then of course, couple of years later I went to Vietnam for BBC television on. I did quite a lot of reporting there right through until 75 when I came out of the embassy compound and the final evacuation. So this was all etched, deepen my experience. But the key thing that has changed meanwhile is that I very much bought into the idea that not only was this a disastrous war, which indeed it was, but the because of the United States was tied up with a bad cause. Therefore the other sides must be a good cause. And I've come to believe having studied a huge amount of material from north Vietnam and from the communist side and so on.

Speaker 3:          00:36:59       That's really north Vietnam and South Vietnam I've come to believe were two rival tyrannies and the idea that g men was a good guy anymore than march its own walls or Jay Guevara. These were absolutely ruthless revolutionary and they did terrible stuff. And whereas everybody has seen the pictures of the south Vietnamese police chief of executing the viet cong prisoner in 1968 on the naked kid running away after a south Vietnamese napalm strike. The communists made very sure that when our photographs of many of the dreadful things that their side did, the terrorism that I'm in, for instance, a entirely reliable or story of one among many village chiefs who was being buried alive in the Mekong Delta in the early 19 sixties by the local communists in front of all these fellow villages to demonstrate that the price of all on redacting the revolution was much worse than death and he pleaded for most of our bullet and the prominence cadres just said that they save the bullets for the, for the imperialists and in the tet offensive of 1968 when thousands of perfectly innocent people whose worse crime as to support the south.

Speaker 3:          00:38:18       That means government were executed in cold blood by the Communist. Again, no pictures of we didn't see all this stuff and I've come to believe that although I don't believe for a moment that the war was winnable, that we weren't. We did allow ourselves, those of us who were correspondence that are all those of us who are reporting the war. All we could see, and most of the stuff we were writing about was what a terrible mess United States and the South Vietnamese were making of it. And yet we saw in 1975 that when the communists game par, um, the ruthlessness and the incompetence with which they behaved, starvation descended on the Vietnamese people in the 19 eighties and any idea that the other side, we're the good guys now seems to be out of order. And I've come very strongly to believe. One is to, of most events in history that neither side had a monopoly of a virtue or vice.

Speaker 3:          00:39:14       So that's one thing. The second thing I think is hugely important is that we are overwhelmingly fact. We were with the Americans, um, and with the US army and the US Marine Corps and so on. And we saw this through an American prison. And yet this was overwhelming. They're Vietnamese tragedy. But while 58,000 Americans died in Vietnam, something over 2 million, 2 million Vietnamese died, at least 40 for every American. Not to mention countless low on Cambodians as well. So I spent a huge amount of time researching a Vietnamese sources and interviewing Vietnamese and sure there are a lot of Americans in my story because the Americans made the big decisions, but I've also tried to put the Vietnamese where they belong, which is the central of the stage of this huge tragedy.

Speaker 2:          00:40:06       Well, I think you bring up an interesting quandary that people can understand because we're confronted with it not uncommonly, even in the modern world, which is with the communist as bad as they were, and doing all these things you were talking about without knowing how the war was gonna turn out. Does that legitimize the involvement of a of one of the two great superpowers of the time? In other words, can you make a moral case that the right thing was done because this sort of thing was happening and it was understood that if the communists took over South Vietnam, there'd be a bloodbath and all these other things, and yet all of the things that you talk about in the later part of your book after the US get involved shows exactly how nasty it is for the Vietnamese people. As you pointed out when we did get involved for all the right reasons. How should you know? Fifty years of thinking about this and seeing how things play out in the region. How do you square the difference between. It might be morally right to go in there and try to save these people from a terrible fate and yet while doing so, inflicted even worse fade on them. I mean, how do you square? How does that. How does that go in your head these days?

Speaker 3:          00:41:11       Absolutely. In my book to people who I got to know a bit when I was a young reporter covering his campaign in 68 general gave Jim Galvin, whom I also knew who was a world war two power true here on Jim Gavin and Eugene McCarthy. Both said I'm at a pretty early stage. They said, whatever the virtue of your cause, if you fight over a village of five or six times, an awful lot of people are going to die and you find yourself thinking at some point there's got to be some proportionality that even if what you want to achieve in a place and especially in Vietnam is, is uh, something that is worthwhile and decent. But in the end you find yourself in danger of destroying the very thing that you're trying to try to save on. The has to be proportionality on one point, which is at the core of my own book, is that I think a mistake we've made in the past and we go on making and remember the British have been very much associated with the United States in Iraq and in Afghanistan and so on.

Speaker 3:          00:42:20       Is that although there has to be a military dimension, if you're going to do these interventions, the key thing is always cultural and social and economic, and if you can't have some sort of cultural engagement with these societies in which you intervene, then you're completely wasting your time winning firefights and to me, and I've said this in the last chapter of my book, you go on winning firefights and these bases and killing bad guys till the cows come home, but unless you've got some linkage with the local people, and I was always very struck by somebody who's become a friend. Hr mcmaster, who more recently was Donald Trump's national security advisor that hr mcmaster, who's an outstanding American army officer. Um, one day about 2006, we were having lunch together and he was telling me about all the great things that his armored calvary regiment had done in Iraq.

Speaker 3:          00:43:18       And then he ended up by saying the trouble was there was nothing to join up to. Now, what he meant was that there was no sort of local government, the local community to be able to fill in after they'd finished winning the battles and exactly the same. Neil Sheehan, I'm a very famous American correspondent in Vietnam. When I was telling him that story a couple of years ago, um, we were discussing and you said it was the same problem in Vietnam. There was nothing to join up to. And I've said in my book that I think the main reason that the communists ended up winning in, in Vietnam was not because they were particularly better soldiers, but because they were Vietnamese and always this problem and it's one sees it in Iraq and Afghanistan again, but a lot of the time the locals don't like foreigners, whether they are British or American or whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:44:10       And um, I, I talked to a Vietnamese who's now become a very successful businessman in California. And he was saying to me that when he was living in Vietnam as a young man, you said the communists were constantly reminding us how humiliating it was to be occupied by the Americans. They had the monopoly of patriotism. Um, what we have to find ways of doing and these interventions is, is hard to, while trying to help these people we can't take over their country is out. Of course, the United States was effectively 64, 65. Everybody knew that the South Vietnamese who were supposed to be running the country couldn't get out of bed in the morning without asking the Americans which side to get out. And the Communists were able to exploit that. So although I'm in any idea that was all the kids thought in the sixties, that was a sort of saintly figure out members, a ruthless revolutionary, but he achieved a state of status or stature as the victor in the colonial war against the French, which the United States and the, the, the what the United States called.

Speaker 3:          00:45:24       I've still got my old press card from Vietnam. Free Weld forces were never able to find anybody who looked like the Patriots and the hero and the nationalist. And how'd she. Men died on the southern side. Um, but I don't know. The longer I write history books and the more you come to learn that very often you can't say it's good Vivo on the blackfeet why? These things were always very complicated and I felt even when I was a young reporter in Vietnam, I never thought the United States look like winning this war, but even then I never felt the other side deserved to either.

Speaker 2:          00:46:00       You bring up some very interesting points in the book of things that make you feel like the government is inept and then you realize, but we do it over and over again, so maybe it's built into the, to the cake. As we say. For example, and to piggyback off the point you just made about the south Vietnamese government trying to appear as though you know they're, they're, they're, they're fighting as much of a nationalist war as the north is. And yet when we first put marines on shore in 1965, as you put pointed out in your book, we didn't even tell the south Vietnamese government we were going to do it. Those are the kinds of things where you would have loved to have been a fly on the wall in the, in the meetings about this. Did somebody bring that up and say this is going to look really bad if, if if we spring this on them or was it or was the tenor of the times such that worrying about what a puppet government. I guess maybe some people would have called it thought about this was was not on their top 10 list of concerns.

Speaker 3:          00:46:57       You're absolutely right. One of the things that always struck me as I also said in the book, all the hot shot meetings in Washington about Vietnam policy, no Vietnamese ever attended any of them. It was always Americans who held the meetings to decide what was going to be done in Saigon and you find, and again I have quoted all the examples were several times when they discussed in Washington whether they should change the Vietnamese government, but when president two and 1970, 74, I'm sorry, 73 look like refusing to sign the peace deal that Henry Kissinger and stitched up. I'm in Paris with the North Vietnamese. There was a serious discussion in Washington about whether to just get rid of president to input in another Vietnamese president. Well, it's not too surprising that the Vietnamese feel humiliated. I mean, all human relations about who makes her feel good and Americans did not make, um, Vietnamese feel good.

Speaker 3:          00:48:00       And I say this is not unique to Americans. I mean, I've seen it myself in Afghanistan with British troops and Salma, um, unless you can, although I don't particularly like that phrase, hearts and minds, unless you can make and help other nations to have self respect and to feel good about themselves. Well, it's always going to be already a tough row to hoe. But one thing I do want to say, which I've also tried to get into my book. I do think that Americans today are sometimes almost floods and atria and their approach to the war. Oh God. Oh God. We were so wicked. Well, although there's no doubt the war was a disaster. A lot of Americans, some of whom I've interviewed for the book went to Vietnam where the highest ideals of service, both some soldiers and some civilians. I've been hugely moved by.

Speaker 3:          00:48:50       Some of the Americans I interviewed for the book. They really cared some of the civilians, especially the language. They completely threw themselves into the whole thing and they weren't sort of wicked imperialists who wanted to do terrible things that they were people who really wanted to do good deeds and a wicked world and I think that a lot of the histories of the war don't pay sufficient tribute to some of these people. I mean, one guy who made an enormous impression on me, I was done on the west coast. I'm interviewing Vietnamese and I heard about a guy called Dave Ramsey who might heard about it, but I never had no idea. He was still alive and I was told he was still alive and living in boulder city. Nevada and I looked at the map and it was more than 300 miles driving my car over from the west coast, the boulder city.

Speaker 3:          00:49:42       But I just thought I may be able to go and see this guy and I got the car and it's a hell of a long drive across the desert and I got to build a city on. There was Doug Ramsey and I spent four hours with him and it was an amazing business because Doug Ramsey was a foreign service officer, a really outstanding American who I'm in 1962. He made up his mind, he wants you to go and serve in Vietnam and was involved in pacification programs or systems for time to John Paul Vann the, um, the very famous American advisor out there. And Doug Ramsey passionately cared about the Vietnamese. He learned. He learned Vietnamese. Um, he, he wrote a lot of stuff for some of his letters home, which you gave me were huge, hugely moving. But then beginning of 66, he was driving a truck with a load of rise up to some village and he got out Bush by the Viet Cong and captured on.

Speaker 3:          00:50:41       He spent the next seven years, not in the Hilton, but in a bamboo cage in the jungle. Seven years you have malaria, 123 times he had every kind of other tropical disease are you survive? God only knows. And yet he came out of this experience, um, is health absolutely destroyed. I mean, when I saw him, he could hardly move his body at all, but his mind was still right on and he taught so moving live because even though he'd suffered so terribly at the hands of the Communist, um, that he was completely even handed in seeing the good stuff and the bad stuff about. And he knew the Viet Cong having been a prisoner for seven years, better than almost anybody else. I mean, he taught me some very funny stories. I mean, one of them that always stuck in my mind. Um, you said one day when he was being interviewed by his interrogators and he told them that he thought that the Americans were in Vietnam 10 percent to help the Vietnamese people are 90 percent to hold back the Chinese and artsy tongue.

Speaker 3:          00:51:43       And he said the communist interrogator applied. In that case, why do you not go and fight him in China? We do not like the Chinese either. Um, another story he told, which was sort of somehow the subject of Tom Hayden came into conversation. Jane Fonda's, a husband who are of course fall in love with Oge men and Koa and spent half his time in, up in north Vietnam telling you the North Vietnamese are wonderful. They were. And when Tom Haynes name was mentioned, uh, uh, Doug Ramsey, he asked his interrogators these. He said, well, what do you think of Tom Hayden? And they said, we think his ideology is excellent, was a man, we despise him. How could you respect to manual? But Tracy's own country like that,

Speaker 2:          00:52:37       alluded to it with the, as you said, these soldiers who went in here for such idealistic reasons. I mean, you quoted a, uh, a man named Harry Williams who had mentioned, you know, we were doing good. We were making a real contribution. We were making things better. Um, it reminds me because I was sort of the younger brother of that baby boom generation that gets so much heat these days and so much flack and yet at the same time, it's hard to not notice that that generation is a bunch of younger people were extremely idealistic and motivated by their idealism. Some went into the peace corps. A lot of this, as you point out, was in response to John f Kennedy's famous sacrifice speech, but some of these people did a similar sort of approach and trying to make the world a better place by doing what you mentioned parachuting into Laos and trying to, to, uh, cut off the Ho Chi Minh trail so that the people in the south good. I mean, it's, it's fascinating to know the word watershed moment. The phrase watershed moment is overused, but it's hard to not notice the difference between 19, 63 United States of America in 1973 United States of America and not attribute a large part of the disillusionment and the change in attitudes to that war. Does that seem right?

Speaker 3:          00:53:52       To go back to your question about why do I think a lot of people make the mistake when they look back at historical events, but they look at them through a 2018 prism. For me, the only way to ride history is to close your eyes and try and remember how things look to people. Then on the first thing to be said about the 19 fifties and sixties, the really was a communist threat, but worldwide. Um, the, um, the Soviet Union and the Chinese did represent deeply unpleasant totalitarian forces of history. I'm quite confident will show that the United States with absolutely right to lead the western nations in resisting. We were the good guys in the Cold War and I have no doubt about that. So sometimes when people say, oh, well, they never really was a common thread. The most certainly was a communist threat. They were very nice to people.

Speaker 3:          00:54:51       However they did not. They did get a terrible tangle and into China because there weren't enough people in Washington who really understood the nuances and understood the nuances, the nationalism. And one of the things I discovered in the course of researching the book, which I had no idea about the Chinese and the Russians fall from being I'm enthusiastic about the Vietnam war, hated the whole business because they were having to throw shed loads of money and resources of weapons. I mean, the Russians were giving the north Vietnamese half a billion dollars a year, which they could afford, but they felt because they, the Chinese, the Russians for competing for leadership, all the socialist world, they had to go on backing this war. But our intelligence, Western intelligence was so bad that nobody had the inkling of the so that right through to Nixon and Kissinger, they still believed in the early seventies that all our actions had to do is pick up the phone to talk to, um, I know I, and, um, the north Vietnamese and make a deal.

Speaker 3:          00:55:50       And it wasn't like that at all. That I've quoted Brezhnev when he was leader Russia saying to the Russian ambassador in Washington, I have no desire to drown in the swamps of Vietnam. And he felt himself almost as much a prisoner of all this stuff as, um, as the American step. He hated it, but they were all stuck in this situation. The other thing too, which I saw the tail end of when I was living here in the sixties, was that America after the Second World War and had achieved such awesome success. I was so powerful and so rich, but it seemed to that generation of Americans that nothing was impossible and no presidents on this very much applied to Lbj, but also to Kennedy. None of them wanted to be the ones to tell the American people that before might of the United States couldn't see often load a raggedy ass communist guerrillas.

Speaker 3:          00:56:44       And there's a very good phrase of Kennedy's that made a great impression on me. I mean, I often hear people say, and I don't believe it, but if Kennedy had lived either God America out of Vietnam, Kennedy told Jay k galbraith is key. An economic advisor, um, a few weeks before he was killed, he said they're only just so many concessions I can make to the communists in any one year. And asked the American people to reelect me and American expectations, the belief among the American people, and certainly in American government that if America wanted something, it must be doable. This was very strong, but of course, as you so rightly said, Vietnam went forward to destroying this. And one of my heroes in this book, or boomer, a marine officer who might spend a lot of time with and admired enormously won't boomer, um, said, um, said to me, he said, nothing you said in my lifetime, uh, has changed America more than Vietnam. He said it created a mistrust and suspicion of government and of the people in charge that we've never been able to undo. And I think he's right about that, don't you?

Speaker 2:          00:57:54       I think that's maybe one of the most persistent things in the war, that credibility gap. And it's hard to describe to Americans now how, as you pointed out in your book, Americans would believe their president most of the time, regardless of which he even was. And it's never been the same. The other thing, as you point out, and as everyone knows, but it's not talked about enough that it changed, is it sort of because it was the second major time, it sort of codified the change, the unspoken change in the US constitutional system where we no longer declared war. You could describe Korea as an outlier if it was once upon a time, but Vietnam becomes the time where we sort of codified this and I was interested very much in, in how you pointed out that the, the legal advisor to the president was explaining, you know, how you could get around having to declare a war.

Speaker 2:          00:58:44       Um, I was also very interested in the, in the Munich question. It was fascinating to me how this specter of appeasement and Munich was sort of hanging over the decision making process and how it played into the domestic politics and how it could almost be used if you, if you compare it to a schoolyard brawl, one side, calling the other a coward and demanding they move. Even if moving wasn't the right political choice. Um, we still have the whole Munich appeasement cudgel at work in today's modern American politics. Can you talk about that and the credibility gap a little bit?

Speaker 3:          00:59:17       What was a big scene to be weak? But it's, it's very difficult. I mean, I think one of the things I find as I get older, and I hope that one is a different person from what I was when I was a young reporter. I meant to tell you a terrible story. Um, I grew up in a household in which all the men in the house, including my father banged on and on about what a wonderful time they'd had in world war two. And I grew up believing with extraordinary neighbor to the wars were great adventures and um, I started out that way and I did the parachutes with our own, our own people and all the restaurant when I was 17. And I really thought that this was all terrific romantic stuff. And really my whole life as a writer has been a sort of journey of discovering the walls are like that.

Speaker 3:          01:00:06       That was a very serious stuff. And there's a great phrase which I sometimes quote to student audiences, but, um, I suppose the lesson it's taken me 50 years to learn was quoted by Norwegian Resistance Shero called knute constant knute Hanson, um, after doing wonderful things with world war two. You raised memoirs in 1948. And in his book he wrote, although was bringing adventures that stirred the heart, the true nature of war is composed of innumerable personal tragedies and sacrifices. Wholly evil are not redeemed by glory. Now he, I think he's absolutely right about that. And I find in my books these days, I write far more about victims that I do about soldiers. But I think one of the things, there are many things that you do learn to have a, a sort of respect for the dilemmas facing governments. That it's very difficult for all governments at all times to decide when to be strong and when to give way.

Speaker 3:          01:01:06       And it's, it used to seem so easy to just send the hundred and first airborne all the US Marine Corps to sort out your problems. What are, we know it's not that simple, but in the end if you can't sort out the cultural issues in these countries, the hundred and first airborne, all the US Marine Corps can't solve them for you any more than our own army camp and up. But I think if one looks at history one see moments, I mean we can all. We all see now that Kennedy was both courageous and bold at the time of the, of the Cuban missile crisis, which could have gone horribly wrong, but sometimes when presidents. I'm in Lyndon Johnson, terribly wanted to be seen to be courageous and to be doing the right thing as the leader of the United States by sending in troops to Vietnam. But of course you've got it wrong, but I, I.

Speaker 3:          01:02:00       What I'd like to feel is that through my own narratives, one is all the time trying to realize that governments are trying to do very difficult things. I don't just mean in the United States government in the context of Vietnam, but most governments most of the time and the same way for military commanders. I mean, I've seen enough wars myself as a reporter, I'm one scene, the not terrible things on the battlefield, but it is very difficult to, uh, to fight wars. It is not as my father and his friends used to say, oh, it's all a great wrong. Um, it's very tough out there on the battlefield and, and I've, I find that at the age of 72, I have a huge sympathy with the people who make the decisions that I didn't have a when I was a stupid young kid.

Speaker 2:          01:02:45       Everyone involved in the decision making process of moving from a, a, a more passive advisor role to putting troops on the ground. I'm going to quote you here. You wrote quote, none doubted that the war would be long and the cost immense quite unlike, for instance, to 2002 decision to invade Iraq in 1965, every hazard was anticipated. I not only found that an interesting line, I found that to be a new piece of information for me. And I've read quite a few books on Vietnam, but it's been a while. And, and that was something that I think changed my paradigm a little. Um, can you explain that because it is interesting to think you would commit eventually half a million troops and, and yet understand how it might not even be winnable and understand how tough it's going to be a and not understand, as you said, the difference between Asian communism and Soviet communism. Um, can you talk about that a little bit?

Speaker 3:          01:03:42       Not in the Johnson White House State Department is Memoranda on the things you said in conversations with the White House, with the president. He wound all along as in thethe does some of the generals, uh, that they didn't think that a jungle war in, in the swamps of the mountains of Vietnam was going to be the kind that suited the US army. Um, I'm, I'm, one of the problems I'm afraid we're already prone to is that we can be terribly impressed by how my trn forces look that if you see I'm a US carrier group at sea and if you see a always terrific on jets taking off from the flight decks and if you see your, your marines storming through the surf, and so they all look so impressive that you can't believe anything can stand up to them, but the word people, smart people in positions of influence in the sixties who did clearly identify the fact that this was going to be very tough and that kind of war in the jungle against guerrillas might well not suit Americans.

Speaker 3:          01:04:51       I'm part of it. One of the things a lot of people George Ball said very smartly, he said, Mr. President, if I thought this could be done in a year. He said, I went back through all the way, but he said, I think it's going to take much longer, and I do not believe that the American people will have the patients for a long walk. And one of the key things is democracies. Light was to be over quick and I always say it's sort of half amuses me that Mike, the last job I did a as a war correspondent, I reported the British Falklands War and no to the British love the Falklands War because we had an incredibly incompetent enemy in the eyes and tight army and it was all over very quickly and we won. Um, and that's the sort of war everybody wants, but unfortunately it's not the kind of war you will get.

Speaker 3:          01:05:35       Um, but now I am impressed, but the number of smart people, some of them in uniform who clearly saw but, but one of the problems facing chiefs of staff and that was true now and that if your a political leader, your president or prime minister says, can you do this? Well, senior generals and admirals and an Ama, they know they've got to justify this stupendous costs of the armed forces. And you've got to be quite a brave man to tell your head of state or your, your chief executive, um, that your forces can't do this or that. I'm in. I remember being amused. I'm a 2002 just before the invasion of Iraq and I was friendly with our then head of the army and I met him one day when you just come back from. I'm from Washington, we've been at a planning meeting for the invasion of Iraq.

Speaker 3:          01:06:26       And I said, well, what do you make of? And he said, well, he said getting into Baghdad it's going to be dead easy. But he said that in the slightest idea what they're going to do when they get that. Um, but at that time, um, that to um, the, um, the, the people making the decisions in Washington didn't seem too much of a problem. But I'm the worst smart people back in 64, 65 who did see that this was going to be a very tough road to hoe. Um, but so, but the people to be, I don't know, again, was always mixed up between horror at some of the stupid people who did bad things both in uniform and out of it. And also admiration. Again, I'm in some of the soldiers and some of the Marines on some of the abstinence song within the framework of a disaster.

Speaker 3:          01:07:17       They did very fine things and I find myself still admiring hugely what they achieved. An alright. You may say you're going to be a, you say, well, it was all for nothing. But mind you, I have to say one story that sticks very much in my mind. One of the most impressive people I interviewed was a former corpsman, a medic with the infantry guy called David Rogers. I'm a David Rogers described being very movingly. His experiences with his platoon of who we said about a third were killed or wounded up north of Saigon in about 69 70. And um, he said, I mean, he was very emotionally affected by the war and remain so. But he said, I'm in 1993. He was one of those who have the Vietnamese invited back as a guest to come and visit the country again. And he went as a reporter and he said they took him to the area where he'd fought with his unit and he said all the Viet Cong embraced him, um, because they rolled under strict orders to be incredibly nice to Americans because they wanted Congress to pass a trade deal on. David Rogers said to me what I had to Redo a couple of years ago. He said I couldn't help thinking they've all these guys while he was a Mcdonald's, couldn't we have sorted this out a long time ago?

Speaker 2:          01:08:37       Johnson was offering if they would just stop infiltrating the south. Let me ask you something that's a little close to home. Maybe I want to talk about the media coverage because this proverbially the war that was lost in America's living rooms and all that kind of stuff. I've found some of the things you said very interesting. I mean, for example, you brought up a point that had never occurred to me. I'm quoting here, I think, or close to it that, um, that Vietnam war era reporters enjoyed a notable advantage over most of their successors in the 21st century because they themselves at often served in uniform and we're familiar with weapons and military ways.

Speaker 3:          01:09:16       Sure.

Speaker 2:          01:09:16       Uh, and, and the other thing that I found interesting was when you talked about the line that some Americans went to their graves believing that reporters betrayed their country while winning applaudance from the media counterparts around the world. Um, can you talk a little bit about media coverage? I mean, for example, I don't think we've seen because before that war, the war coverage was very censored, world war type stuff. And yet somehow after that war, they've toned down. I mean, now we have embedded reporters who are essentially working with the governments. I don't think we've ever seen the kind of freedom to show news the way they did in that war. And do you think that was a good thing or a bad thing? And do you think the reporters at the time did a good enough job pointing out what you mentioned, the other side's transgressions and atrocities and everything so that things would be equal a little bit

Speaker 3:          01:10:04       in the introduction to my book, think many of the reporters who served in Vietnam did not standing job of reporting entirely accurately what they themselves saw and knew where they failed was because it was so much going on on the other side that they had no access to, but I'm an incredibly bad stuff, but the other side was doing never got any sort of show and I quite understand in a very small way I was party to it myself because you know, when I was reporting for BBC and newspapers in the early seventies and all the time you were seeing shocking stuff been going on all around you and you were witness to the corruption on the incompetence of the South Vietnamese government. But we just didn't pay enough attention to this stuff we couldn't see and the United States. Whereas it was absolutely true that there was a huge credibility gap because a lot of the stuff that was a, we were told that briefings and solve with absolute garbage, um, but the numbers, all this stuff up, body counts and so on.

Speaker 3:          01:11:06       The frightful lies were told in fact, boomer, the General Marine Corps general. And he said to me that one of the lessons he brought home from three tours in Vietnam was telling the truth. But the curious thing that the sort of contradiction on the one hand a lot of senior Americans did not tell the truth to the world about what was happening. But on the other hand, America dippers have a commitment that was very honorable to let us see for ourselves. So that in a way that's never been repeated in any war sense. That if any of us, I'm sort of didn't believe what we were being told about. Some bell going off in the middle of nowhere. We could get access on me as a British journalist, as much as anybody on fixed wing aircraft and helicopters to go there and look for ourselves and the Communists would never let anybody but Jane Fonda go up and see what the hell was going on in that neck of the woods.

Speaker 3:          01:11:59       Um, and I do not believe that the business, the media lost the war, but I certainly do believe that, uh, the way the war was covered up made it more difficult for the United States. But, um, I mean a point, my father was a war correspondent in world war two and I once said to him that having been reading some of his wartime dispatchers, they seem to be pretty gung Ho. And he said what we were doing as part of the war effort. Now, of course, nearly all the senior officers who were in Vietnam, American senior officers, they'd been in world war two and they were accustomed to dealing with the media that would play the game. I'm in what was seen to be in the national interest. They wouldn't break ranks. And now suddenly in Vietnam they find that you've got a whole lot of reporters refused to accept that I'm telling the story the way that Mac v is, they've always known of one of the toll was, was not going to happen, and they found it very difficult to adjust to this.

Speaker 3:          01:12:55       Um, and I think what is also fair, but some John, this I think it would be dishonest about. I mean I was taking apart the television discussion a year or so ago with a group of former war correspondents, including some Americans. And I said they were talking about their commitment to tell the truth and tell the world what was going on. And I said, shouldn't we also met that when you're, when you're as young as we all were and so on. It was a great adventure. And we had the time of our lives in many ways. We were all responsible kids. Well, none of the others would admit that at all. In fact, they got very angry with me for saying that. But I'm afraid the were in Vietnam. A lot of the journalists were frankly, what I would call war tourists. Um, there was some brilliant, serious minded super people like Neil CNN, David Halberstam, and so, so there were some very fine correspondence, but I'm in, it was a great life. There were unlimited girls drugs, delicious food, beautiful country and all rest of it. Um, and although some of the media, how they find this in Vietnam, um, I would also say that some of the media had the unfinished style, like the television crew that provided a knife for a soldier to cut the ears off, some dead Viet Cong on camera and that sort of stuff. So, um, the media, his record in Vietnam was pretty mixed. Um, there was some stuff we're proud open some stuff, frankly the same dog

Speaker 2:          01:14:27       in terms of protests and everything else because it's interesting as a kid growing up in the post Vietnam era, I just thought that was the new reality that would be expected in future conflicts. And yet now looking 50 years back on things, if you really, if you start in the second world war, there's very little of that large spike in anti war activity. I mean, not only were there no protesters protesting the bombing of Germany and Japan, but they're really by 1960 standards weren't that much after the Vietnam War for any of the conflicts. What do you think accounts for that being such an outlier situation?

Speaker 3:          01:15:02       I've suggested in my book, I remember I was living here in the late sixties, so I saw it, the demonstrations and the whole thing, but all sorts of stuff got tangled up together. It was the worldwide youth movement against the established order on the revolt against the old sexual morality and the enthusiasm of a part of the and all this stuff got rolled up with Vietnam. Um, and you've got to remember, kids in those days were putting posters on their college walls or we Tang who, anybody who knows anything knows was one of the great mass murderers of the 20th century up there with, with Hitler. So, um, the walls, incredible naivety among the kids. The kids were right about one thing, the war was a disaster, but of course one of the things that drove the protest movement was the fact that a lot of them were terrified of being drafted, um, that they were afraid they were going to have to waste two years of their lives in uniform and maybe lose their lives all together.

Speaker 3:          01:16:04       So I'm mixed up with the principle objections to the war and mixed up with the whole youth revolt was they felt they had skin in the game about, about the danger to themselves. And they were, I mean, it was an extraordinary time to be here. I mean, some of the stuff that I saw myself, um, was you actually felt America was falling apart in 1968. And in fact, the fact that it didn't fall apart. I've never gone to a bank of America ever since. One's always, I always believed passionate this day. And America is capacity of reinvention because I saw what a mess it could get itself into it in [inaudible] 68 and come out the other side, but no subsequent war. The other thing we must remember, the whole thing was much smaller and we probably talked too much in this conversation about all the battlefields stuff and um, if you look at casualties, I mean I've written about one battle in one chapter of my book called Dido that absolute nobody's ever heard of and this was a three day battle in May, 19, 68 in which are marine battalion.

Speaker 3:          01:17:06       It was more or less wiped out, up near the demilitarized in three days of bottling, which they lost 81 killed and I forget about 250 wounded and they ended up with one on wounded officer and I'm about 150 men still fit for combat and nothing remotely like that happened in Iraq or in Afghanistan. I mean, the scale. This was a, a really murderous bloody business in, in some of the stuff people did and some of the stuff people experienced. Um, I mean it was, it was, it was as bad as well too, or career at times. I mean, um, but I don't think. I don't buy the line that Vietnam is the worst world that ever was. I'm in all wars are pretty ghastly, but it was a hell of a lot worse, um, in the scale of the bloodbath than anything remotely in Afghanistan or Iraq and these are volunteer. They've been fought by volunteer soldiers

Speaker 2:          01:18:07       magazine killed that week and sometimes the casualty levels could get high enough, a hundreds a week. Then I would say.

Speaker 2:          01:18:15       And I was trying to figure out how we would react today in the United States to casualty. Well, and that brings me back to something you had talked about, the war being a disaster and then we had talked about the protesters in the media and everything. It does make me wonder though, what is the responsibility if your government seems on a course to continue doubling down on something that everyone knows is a disaster in a democratic or republican system. What is the role of the population in terms of checking a government that, as you said, didn't know what they were getting into or didn't know what they were getting into but found no way out of where they were going. I mean, could one make the case that it was better to have that kind of pressure on the part of the electorate versus what might have happened if that pressure had not been there?

Speaker 3:          01:18:58       What I was living in the United States, I could see a lot of Americans, especially in middle America, Middle America, very well in that era in Minnesota and Wisconsin. And you saw very patriotic Americans wrestling with the dilemma of, well, loyalty. Les, did you just blindly go on supporting your president or, or did you not? They weren't to kind of go out and protest in the streets, but it's a very difficult issue and I think it is right. Just speak up. But, um, it's never easy to decide where the patriotic root lies. And I remember one of the most moving things that, that happened to me, um, when I was there in 71 and I've been up reporting for BBC of Battle of playschool Farber's six up in the, in the, you know, the border hell of a murderous business. And we hitched a ride back. Saigon on a c 1:30.

Speaker 3:          01:19:55       That was only one other camera crew, wally, he was so in the cargo hold of this huge aircraft on down at the end of the plane or the opposite. Then from us was the body bag, an American sergeants and advisor, um, who have been killed in the battle and there's his body bag with all his stuff around him, his guitar and the sound system on all these kids. And so on. Um, we had an hour and a half or two hours on the plane down to Saigon looking. I was sort of looking at this, that poor bastard, he, he's an, he's a body bag and so on. And I thought we're now in a situation where nobody wants to be the last American to die in a war that's obviously lost. And I think one of the things that one does bitterly reproached Nixon and Kissinger for from the moment they assumed office in [inaudible] 69.

Speaker 3:          01:20:45       They knew there was no hope of winning the war, but they were desperate for purely political reasons, to conceal from the American people about the war was lost and 22,000 Americans died under the Nixon presidency and I'm Vietnamese and it was in many ways the worst period because you've got the whole black power thing. You've got the army in Vietnam falling apart, a huge drug problems and so on and so forth and all this. They knew all the way down the street. There was no way they were going to win this, but they were just desperate to avoid anybody finding out about this. And to me, one of the grizzlies bits, the White House tapes were relatively recently released in 2015 is a kissinger coming back from the secret Paris peace talks in October 72 and he rushes into the of the Oval Office and he says, next. He says, Mr.

Speaker 3:          01:21:37       President, we have got a better deal than you have ever dreamed on. And remember, this is a month before Nixon faces George Mcgovern in the presidential election and Kissinger doesn't say this is going to bring peace. There's going to save countless lives. He said this will absolutely, totally screwed mcgough and the cynicism of these guys at this stage, um, and it was all about politics and, and that's a pretty. It's, it's, it's, it's hard. It sticks in your crawl, you know. But actually one thing I would say, which I think is important as a sort of closing note on this, to me, the supreme irony of the war, if you go to Vietnam today, um, if you'd said to an American and about 66, how would you like Saigon to look in 2018? We'll actually, it'd be pretty much the way it looks now. And although it's still a very unpleasant totalitarian state vet now they do now have license to make money.

Speaker 3:          01:22:33       They want to be Americans. They're incredibly nice to Americans because they realize that the American system is, um, worth countless more valuable and can't this a more valid than their own Richard government. Um, but they're all completely hooked on American culture and on making money. And I've suggested in the last chapter of my book, the United States failed in Vietnam, will be 52 years and spooky gunships and defoliation the united trial. I'm with Johnny Depp on Youtube, but what we've learned is that is the economic forces can be at least as important if not more so than than soldiers. And deciding how history plays out.

Speaker 2:          01:23:21       Rock and roll and Playboy magazine. It'll become American.

Speaker 3:          01:23:25       You said it the way

Speaker 2:          01:23:28       Max. We've hardly touched upon all the good things in this book though, and I would like to encourage anyone who would love to get an updated really interesting view of Vietnam from somebody who wasn't just there but has had a chance to think and talk and do research about it ever since sir.
