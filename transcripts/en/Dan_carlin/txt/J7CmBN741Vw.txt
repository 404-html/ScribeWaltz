Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Because some bus,

Speaker 2:          00:00:02       it's history,

Speaker 1:          00:00:03       41,

Speaker 3:          00:00:06       a date which will live in infamy,

Speaker 1:          00:00:16       perfect to the lead from this time and place,

Speaker 4:          00:00:34       I take pride in the words Ich Bin, the Alina

Speaker 1:          00:00:41       The drama. Hi, welcome. This kind of examination because people have got to know whether or not their president or crop, if we dig deep in our history and our doctor and remember that we are not descended from fearful man.

Speaker 2:          00:01:10       It's hardcore history.

Speaker 2:          00:01:17       The dictionary defines the word laconic as a form of speech that is blunt or pithy that uses an economy of words to make a point and sometimes the point is particularly biting or on target or maybe mysterious, and I love the word because the word refers to a way of speaking that was popular amongst a particular group of people in Ancient Greece. People known as lack of Demoniac, otherwise known as spartans laconic speeches, spartan speech. That's the way they're supposed to have talked. Imagine you know the love child of Clint Eastwood and Batman, and that's the way they spoke. You know man's gotTa know his limitations. Man's got to know his limitations. Spartans are the kings of the one liners in ancient Greek history and they are cinematic and character. I mean there's not a movie maker out there that wouldn't want Clint Eastwood during his various movie years playing various forms of Spartans, you know, from a Spaghetti Western era in his twenties.

Speaker 2:          00:02:31       He could play your average spartan warrior and he gets into the dirty Harry films, you know, 72, 73, 19, 74 and he begins to age a little bit more, but he plays one of those older spartan warriors and then you get him, you know, after the dirty Harry's or over. And he's an older man and now he's the king and he talks like he talks in all his other movies combined with Batman. And you have, you know, the way the spartans are supposed to have spoken laconically how cool is it the 25 centuries after those people were at the height of their fame and power. We still know the way they talked. It's famous, it's famous because people wrote about it. People whose works, we still have

Speaker 2:          00:03:11       telling you the way a certain people spoke that long ago. Describing some of the things that they said, all these sorts of little details help bring color to the story. They, they help us all relate to these people a little bit more. These are human touches that flesh out these historical figures. When you begin to get this sort of stuff, the sorts of details that you were likely to hear in an oral tradition anywhere in the world before this time period, but when you begin to get these stories that have come down to us, you begin to see truly cinematic type creations stories that you could take with very little changes and updating and make movies out of them today and have them be popular

Speaker 2:          00:04:00       and it's not just the character development either. The themes can be epic in these stories. Take for example, the most famous story involving Sparta at all. The famous incident in for ADBC. He at the pass of Thermopylae, the so called hot gates. This may be because of the movies and because of the books that have been written forever. This may be the earliest confirmable historical event. Most Americans know about the defensive 300 spartans against a million or so Persians, a battle that some have described over the era's for the existence of Western civilization. By the way, if those are the stakes, whose side are you rooting for? What was it? The India leader Mohandas Gandhi supposedly said, when someone asked him what he thought of Western civilization, didn't he say something like, I think it would be a good idea. Nonetheless, the way this story is framed from the get go is designed to have you affiliate with one side over. The other. One side is like the plucky little republic with Luke Skywalker in star wars and their beleaguered and you know they're good and they're under pressure and they're trying to survive against darth vader and the empire. That will sniff out all freedom and hope and happiness and you know, all those kinds of things. That's the way the ancient story is handled. Have what are called the Greek and Persian wars.

Speaker 2:          00:05:29       A moment that has sometimes been portrayed in apocalyptic terms for what is sometimes been called the West once upon a time. Christendom, so already many in the West are going to feel like it's a sporting event and we're the home team, right? We're all homeowners when it comes to the Greek and Persian wars, unless of course you're more like the people who were portrayed as the Persians back then remember, this is not just an ethnic thing. This is a values

Speaker 5:          00:05:58       thing, and in the narrative sometimes called the grand narrative by some greases, fighting for things like liberty and freedom and democracy and artistic. I mean everything that the evil empire isn't evil. Empire will sniff it all out and make slaves of everyone. So who are you going to side with? Right? The story of [inaudible] is one of those that is absolutely dramatic beyond anything you get in earlier history and it's because you have a master storyteller. Imparting the story to you. When I started in news reporting and editor said to me, your job is to relate the facts of the story, the true information, and do so in the most compelling way you can. If you imagine the battle of Thermopylae as written by, say the scribes of Babylonia, it might sound like this, in the 14th year, the king of lands by the will of Marduk overcame the Spartan army at a place called the hot gates.

Speaker 5:          00:06:55       Two hundred 97 of the enemy were counted. The Spartan King went to his destiny. The Babylonians had been writing that way forever. They were great. Record keepers. Things were a little dry though. Now north of them were the Assyrians, a culture that existed sort of alongside the Babylonians, a lot more aggressive and big on the propaganda front and didn't mind shoveling people's nose in their defeats and they like to maintain, shall we call a muscular foreign policy. There's what sounded a little bit more like darth vader's pr from issuing a press release. They would have described the battle of thermopylae like this, like a storm. I overthrew them all. I slew their king. I crucified their land. I devastated that. You may notice that there's not a lot of character development there and less making the king of Assyria. Frightfully terrifying is the development you're after. Nonetheless, as I said in this story, darth vader's really the only character on the other side that gets fleshed out very much compare the sample Babylonian and the Syrian approaches to this story, to something like the description you get from people like Heraclitus of helicon Asas sometimes called the father of histories, occasionally called the father of lies, writing his history, a generation after the events at their mop Ali.

Speaker 5:          00:08:24       He talks about, you know the spartans blocking this road, and there's a tale that has developed over the hundreds of years afterwards of an event that people have been adding a few screen writing touches to since the very beginning. As the story is often told, there's a bunch of Greeks trying to block the army of the Persians from coming into southern Greece. Xerxes, the crack of doom named Persian king, the only truly free person in his whole society. The story would have you believe rules all of Asia and so many other lands that he is entitled a King of Kings. All his people or the equivalent of slaves who can live or die on his whim and when he orders them to fight the spartans in this past, they obey and our whipped by overseers onto the spears of the spartans. The last stand is it's called a thermopylae.

Speaker 5:          00:09:19       The greatest last stand probably in all human history was not supposed to be the kind of last stand. It turned out to be there with thousands of Greek soldiers at their monopoly initially, but eventually it became apparent that it was going to be a death trap. And so the Spartan King, a guy named Leon, he does supposedly sent the other Greeks away and kept a sort of rear guard. If you want to stick with the narrative, a rear guard for Greek and western freedom behind to hold off the Persians. There were other Greeks who were involved in the so called last stand at thermopylae, but it's the spartans who get the most attention, about 300 of them. And again, you can understand why as characters they were fascinating in their own time. The spartans are a kind of a cultural experiment. A better way to put it is when you think about all human history together, there's enough law of averages stuff working where you can see all kinds of little human experiments going on in various communities in Sparta.

Speaker 5:          00:10:15       It's whether or not the culture can infuse a certain fighting quality too. It's human beings. If they grow up a certain way, pressured by the culture in certain facets that just make them more likely to be extremely nasty. In Combat Spartan Warrior Sparty, it's do nothing but fighting. There is no other job for them. The entire culture seems to be designed from much of what we know now to reinforce this, including a code of laws and behavior that tended to make these spartans enough alike so that laconic became a term that described. You know, most of them, they're not a lot of chatty spartans in history. The culture didn't encourage that. Listened to the color though. That's come down from this story. The great kings, xerxes with his army reported to be a million men so large that it drinks. The river is dry that it passes through, comes to this road with this past that has to be crossed, and these small group of Greek hoplites guarding it and xerxes, according to Hurghada tests, doesn't know what to do, can't quite believe what he seeing.

Speaker 5:          00:11:23       Look at the color in the story. According to Hurghada, xerxes sends a spy to go up to the spartan lines and try to figure out what's going on and not get caught. Not only does he not get caught, but according to Herat at this, he reports back to xerxes and says that the Spartan warriors couldn't have cared less, that he was there. They were fine with him looking around. They didn't care. He said they were doing exercises and combing their hair. Again, you have to imagine clint eastwood with long hair and a beard right there. That'd

Speaker 2:          00:11:54       be worth the price of admission right with his tall sinewy guy, not a big muscle bound guy doing bodyweight exercises. You know, calisthenics, pushups, sit ups, gymnastics. That's how they prepped and the combing the long hair was a spartan thing. XERXES could not get his mind around. Hurghada is basically says the idea that these people, a couple hundred of them, we're going to try to take on his reportedly million man army, so he calls in an advisor that he has. He's got a spartan king with him, a guy who fell out of favor and he hooked up with the Persians, thinking that if they conquer all the grease, it might be good for him. He's been the advisor to the great king of kings up till now. He had told the king earlier about these people and they'd made fun of him, so now xerxes called him back to report on what the spy had said.

Speaker 2:          00:12:42       The spartans were doing. I'll let hirata tests. This ancient screenwriter handled the story from their writing. Twenty 500 years ago, quote xerxes listened, but could not understand that the lack of Simonian's we're really preparing to kill or be killed to fight as much as was in their power, seemed to him to be the height of folly, the action of fools. So he sent for Dme, Maritou, son of aristotle who was in the camp and when to meritus arrived. Xerxes questioned him about everything he had been told, trying to understand the meaning behind what the lack of Simonian's we're doing to tomorrow answered. You heard what I said about these men before when we were just setting out against the Greeks and you made me a laughing stock when you heard my view of how these matters would turn out, but it is my greatest goal to tell the truth in your presence, so hear me now.

Speaker 2:          00:13:35       Once again, these men have come to fight for control of the road and that is really what they are preparing to do for it. Is there a tradition that they groom their hair whenever they are about to put their lives in danger? Now know this, if you subjugate these men and those who have remained behind in Sparta, there is no other race of human beings that will be left to raise their hands against you. For you are now attacking the most noble kingdom of all the Greeks and the best of men. What to Maritou said Hirata test rights seemed quite incredible. Dessert sees and he asked for a second time how they could possibly intend to fight his whole army since there were so few of them to Mera toast, replied, sire. If things do not turn out, just as I claim, they will treat me like a liar and to quote to lie to the great king of kings, of the acumen, Persian empire was a capital crime. He was basically saying, if this doesn't turn out exactly like I told you, it will. You can kill me. That's pretty darn colorful right there, but it gets even better.

Speaker 2:          00:14:41       The Great King of the Persians were supposed to send a messenger to the spartan lines to King Leona and say, basically, join us. We'll make you the overlords. Greece, you'll have more than you ever had before. A lot of nations had done that. Joining the Persian empire was not a bad idea. Sometimes he's basically saying, we can make a deal here. It'll be worth your while. His father dairy, this was a great deal maker in the xerxes, was coming from a position of negotiation here and the spartans basically dressed him down morally saying something to the effect of, you know, you have all this land already, but you need to bother us. We'd rather die for Greece than own anything. It was one of those wonderful spartan, moralistic, putdowns. Again, spoken with as few words as possible and then famously as recorded by plutarch's 600 years after the event, surrogacy sends another messenger to the Spartan lines, supposedly another message for the king of the spartans and says to all the men who can hear them, you can all go home, all will be forgiven. Just put down your arms and then you get the wonderful phrase, Milan of a translated in many different ways, but it just is good. Pretty much any of them come and take them.

Speaker 2:          00:15:58       Lay down your arms, come and take them. Come and get them having come take. You can take them when we're all dead. A lot of the different ways, the difficult to translate. Greek is used. It's still, by the way, the motto of the Greek First Army Corps, it's been used for many causes all throughout history cause it's such a great, dramatic, colorful spit in the face of death line, isn't it? It's a clint eastwood line. Do you feel lucky? Punk come and take them. How do you not stand up in the theater and cheer when that moment hits? That's every screenwriter, his dream to have a scenario like that and if it can be true, how wonderful is that? The Greek chroniclers who wrote about this stuff did not skimp on the drama and it makes it colorful. It makes it real, it makes it compelling even 2,500 years later and you give your right arm to have this kind of stuff right out of the mouths of the oral historians from all these places that didn't have them and look black and white because of it. The Persian story must be magical. Also, we don't have that story and traditionally it's difficult for us to imagine that. We'd like to hear from a pro perspective the story of Darth vader and the empire, but throughout history they weren't always darth vader and some of the greatest chroniclers of all time have gone to great lengths to show in fact that they may have been on God's side, if you will. If that turns out to be the case, who's side are you rooting for them?

Speaker 2:          00:17:37       Of course in this time period, the Iron Age, ancient world and in this area, the Mediterranean and the Near East, you'd have to be a heck of a lot more specific when you start talking about dvds to just say God. The likely response during that era might've been which God. It was a wild and crazy time for religion in that part of the world and they had a lot of different ones and they ran the gamut from things you might understand today too wild and crazy and everything in between. Most of these religious beliefs had a pantheon of gods, a bunch of them. Some of them had a sort of a dominant leave God, but, but having, you know, multiple gods was normal. There were groups, especially one known for only having one God and they were the ones that put together with divine or without divine help. Take your pick a tome, a combination of catalog of events and stories and accounts and perspectives and admonitions and hymns, and it's hard to describe exactly what the old Hebrew Bible is.

Speaker 2:          00:18:49       It's also hard to know when it was written, are the accounts from the period around the time the Persians first appeared on the scene legitimate from that period. Most Biblical experts think they were written later. Nonetheless, we use plutonic 500 years after the fact, and so does everyone else. So when the old Hebrew Bible in multiple places talks about the Persians, we should probably at least note the attitude and the attitude that the writers, whomever they may have been of those works had toward the Persians, especially early on, wasn't just positive. It was divine, meany, meany, technical. You farson number number, weight divisions. That's my favorite part of the Bible. The Old Hebrew Bible, which is so full of wonderful stuff. You know, the Greeks don't have the market totally cornered on color. There's just not a ton of stuff from the parts of the world during the time period represented by the Bible, but remember there's a lot of discussion over when various pieces of the Bible were written.

Speaker 2:          00:19:55       A lot of this good stuff might've been written in well into the pros periods. So we've entered into the color era because there's so much color on the book of Daniel has this scary story, spooky story. It's not like a horror movie, but it's a spooky movie. And today you'd have to have a little CGI helped to make it work. But it's my favorite scene. It's out of the book of Daniel and it involves a ghostly hand writing words on a wall, meany, meany tackle. You farson. And you have to back up a little bit in the story to set the scene. But the king of Babylon, who the Bible Calls Belshazzar is having a party, he and his buddies and some concubines. That's the way the Bible puts it. Probably have to imagine some loud music. Um, you know, and there's, there's booze. I mean, they're drinking and at a certain point the king of Babylon wants to really nice silver were brought in and the big cups of gold and silver, the ones they took from Jerusalem when they sacked the capital of Judah not that long ago, because that's what the Babylonians had done, scattered a bunch of Jews everywhere, forced a lot of the premier families and craftsmen and artisans to deport all the way back to Babylon and destroyed Solomon's temple when it comes to pr.

Speaker 2:          00:21:13       This belshazzar guy and the Babylonians are not getting a ton of it positive from the Bible. And while he's drinking out of his big, you know, alluded cup, hanging out with the concubines, all of a sudden the ghostly hand with a finger appears right under the lamp and it starts writing on a wall, meany, meany tackle. You farson. And everybody freaks out. My King James version of the Bible makes it sound like he essentially couldn't control his bowels. He was so scared. My, uh, later, more colloquial version just sticks to the knees shaking version. Nonetheless, he couldn't figure out what it meant. So the Bible says, this Babylonian leader called in all his sorcerers and necromancers and astrologers. All these people you know, the wizards that advised you know the high Babylonian King and part of what makes Babylonian so fricking wonderful is there a combination of like rational, logical, hard, observational science and mathematics and all these kinds of things with divination.

Speaker 2:          00:22:21       You have to imagine a Stephen Hawking type character, but a [inaudible] board is an integral part of how he goes about his business. It's fascinating, but none of these people, the Bible says, can explain to Belshazzar what the writing means. And then someone reminds him that his father used this guy, this depor tea from Judah after the Babylonians had destroyed Jerusalem there and he was here in Babylon and we could bring them in and see if he knows what the ghostly writing means. And belshazzar grabbed the guy and brought him in, and it was Daniel who was indeed a deportee. And Belshazzar, our gives him the same offer he gave to his soothsayers. Listen, you tell me what this means and you know, gold chains and you'll rule a third of the kingdom. And all this kind of stuff, and Daniel says, you keep your gifts or give them to somebody else.

Speaker 2:          00:23:06       I'll tell you what the writing means. I have a lot of different versions of the Bible, the Torah. All these things in front of me and all the versions are good, but the King James Bible with it's you know, wrath of God style, no sums it up perfectly. Daniel looks at the meany, meany, teco you Farson and describes the words is meaning number number, weight divisions, and then defines that as meaning this from the King James version quote, this is the interpretation of the thing. God has numbered thy Kingdom and finished it. Now art weighed in the balances and found wanting thy kingdom is divided and given to the medes and the Persians and quote that pretty colorful stuff, isn't it? And in that version, the king of the Persians, a guy named Darrius conquers Babylon that knife and kills Belshazzar. Well, none of that's true, but that's how the Bible story goes.

Speaker 2:          00:24:05       Nonetheless, it's clear from that perspective that the Persians in this story are not going to be the bad guys. They're going to be the instrument of God that rectifies things. If God is on any one side in that story, he's on the side of the medes and the Persians. Who the heck are these medes and Persians, and if they're so good in this story, during the time of the Babylonians, how do they go from that to the evil, the Greek? See, you know, two or three rulers later. Well, let's remember, darth vader wasn't always evil, and in fact, the guy who will kick off the Persians first real appearance on the world stage will be a guy that is so beloved by at least the Hebrew God. He will be the only non Jew ever proclaimed a messiah. The person who will get this honor is known in your history books by the name of Cyrus, the second or cyrus the great.

Speaker 2:          00:25:08       If you wanted to make it sound a little bit more like it probably sounded in Persian, you would say, cool rush. He's probably the greatest conqueror in world history. Up until the time of Alexander, he's got some of the best historical press anybody's likely to get. Nobody has a bad word to say about the guy, even the Greeks like him xenophon, we'll write a whole book essentially romanticizing Cyrus's, the greatest perfect world leader in wind. You like to be like him and here's how you could emulate what he did and that Kinda thing. Cyrus becomes part of a Greek motif that western tradition will continue for a long time that portrays the east as decadent and soft and corrupt, but then how do you explain how some of these great empires got started? Well, the way the Greeks do it is Cyrus's fantastic, and he builds up this entire thing and bequeathed it to the Persians who proceeded to become soft and rich and lazy and decadent and ruined what the great cyrus gave them.

Speaker 2:          00:26:07       So even the Greeks portray, Cyrus has this great figure, and yet we know so little about the guy. If you contrast what we know about him and the guy who probably takes the crown from him, his greatest conqueror in the world up to that point, Alexander the Great. It's night and day. Alexander the great exists in a fully colorized historical world. A post hirata tests world, a world where Alexander will bring his own publicists with him from place to place so they can record his latest deeds and sayings and doings. Cyrus the great founds, the last great empire and maybe what could call the black

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       and white era in the Near East, an era where we know the majority of the people back then because of things like monoliths and statues and reliefs and carvings and tune paintings and architecture and ruins. When you do have writing, you get business records and proclamations and transactions. Some of the best stuff you get from this era are the correspondence is the letters between diplomats and governors and rulers, but what none of those people are doing is writing to amuse or entertain anybody. All of the writing from the black and white period of human history is colder. They all have a purpose beyond being entertaining. It might be a religious purpose of business purpose at governmental purpose or even two important officials writing each other about in a matters of state and a few personal things creep in. That's very different than writing something to be performed in front of a live audience for their entertainment and enjoyment.

Speaker 5:          00:27:49       I read something historian Michael Grant had written about Hurghada tests suggesting that the reason hirata test has the interesting structure that he does to his histories is because it was not meant to be read as much as it was meant to be performed. Live, ran allowed by Hirata test himself and that the digressions and the tangents in the work represent things that would have worked much better in a live situation with somebody broadcasting, if you will, an oratory as opposed to you somebody writing something to be read by somebody else remotely. If that's the case and you don't really have the first written prose history with Hurghada tissue of the script for Hurghada does his live show, if you will, which would explain a lot considering that if you want to get drama and color and stories before the period of Herat at is you're looking at things like the Iliad by homer or the epic of Gilgamesh from Mesopotamian history.

Speaker 5:          00:28:41       Both of which are believed by the way to have been stories told for hundreds of years that we're finally compiled and written down. Same thing with like a beowulf in Scandinavian history may be Hurghada. This is more like the ancient storytellers than first meets the eye to give him some credit. Heraclitus was trying to be a chronicler at the same time that he was trying to do the same thing I was told to do in news reporting to relate the facts as best as he understood them in the most compelling way he could. So what you have here in this ancient story is not so much myth that wouldn't be fair, not just to people like Hurghada. Despite all of the great historians over time who have found all these records and put together like a jigsaw puzzle, a, a viewing of the past that is always being redone and improved, but wouldn't have even existed there if a ton of different pieces of the puzzle hadn't been brought together. But at the same time, while it's not myth, not exactly true either.

Speaker 5:          00:29:37       There are historians who've spent their whole lives trying to separate the truth from the fiction in works like Heraclitus actually laughed out loud when I read [inaudible] book from Cyrus to Alexander Brown is one of the great historians of Ancient Persia. And this book is like the encyclopedia. I mean, it's very detailed, very specific. It's 1200 pages. It's a, it's an enormous comprehensive book and the very first lines in it are as part of the opening page where he quotes an artist, um, who says quote, and even if it is not true, you need to believe in ancient history and quote, does anything better set up the dichotomy here and how wonderful that in a 1200 page book that is exhaustive as all get out, the very first line from the historian is yeah, it might not be true, but you have to believe it anyway. It's, it's, it's wonderful.

Speaker 5:          00:30:31       And it sums up the problem with ancient history and that is that you have the feeling that most of what you're reading here is the truth. And these events did happen, but there's a lot of fiction mixed in and it's difficult to know what's what, and it's difficult to separate one from the other. It's also difficult to know where to begin the story. This is a classic problem anybody has trying to explain something, right? How do you begin a story of Cyrus the second and the Persians? When does that start? All histories connected as we know, right? It's all a bunch of tumbling dominoes and one event and series of events leads up to other ones and sets it all up. Where's the logical starting point? I'm terrible at this by the way. I did a whole series on the decline and fall of the Roman republic hours and hours and hours because I was trying to find the logical place to start a story about Cleopatra never even got practically to Cleopatra was all dominoes before. Then Iran test starts with the earliest thing. He knows about it and it's a miracle. He knows about it at all. He begins by talking about the Assyrians.

Speaker 5:          00:31:32       He also talks about having multiple versions of this story, so Hurghada is being harassed at this. He says, listen, I've heard a lot of different things. Here are my sources. The story begins, boom, and here's what he writes. Quote from here, our story demands that we inquire further about Cyrus and the Persians, who was this man who destroyed the empire of creases and how did the Persians become the leaders of Asia? I shall write this account using as my sources certain Persians who do not intend to magnify the deeds of Cyrus, but rather to tell what really happened. Although I know of three other ways in which the story of Cyrus is told and quote, and then he begins the story using a phrase that should probably be proceeded by a line like once upon a time quote. The Assyrians ruled inland Asia for 520 years and the needs were the first to revolt from them.

Speaker 5:          00:32:25       It would seem that they proved themselves to be truly courageous men by fighting the Assyrians for the cause of freedom and they succeeded in casting off slavery and we're liberated afterwards. The other ethnic groups freed themselves as the medes had done and quote, well, the medes need a little explaining, just like at the biblical story of Belshazzar is feast when he said that the empire is going to be divided between the medes and the Persians. The medes and the Persians are a related people. The Greeks used the terms interchangeably. They were, you know, practically like brothers in the eyes of the Greeks when I was growing up, they were just starting to change from the brothers sort of interpretation and may be saying, oh, maybe they were more like first cousins. Some of the more recent histories I've been reading. Maybe you could say we downgrade the relationship even a step further to something like second cousins who fought.

Speaker 5:          00:33:14       Sometimes historians differ on when these related people's arrived in the area where they can now play a role in the history of this, you know, enclosed sort of geopolitical world with Egypt and Babylon in the Syria and all these places. There's even a few historians who think they may have always been there and you just didn't hear about them. Nevertheless, the world upon which they have intruded is so old. It's hard for modern people to get our minds around because it's hard for us to imagine something 2,500 years ago. You know when thermopylae is happening. Now, imagine something from 2,500 years before that. That's how old this world is. I love the way in the 19 forties, historian 80 olmsted tried to give the reader a sense of how old this world was and how the people who lived in it new it was old.

Speaker 5:          00:34:07       He starts by talking about Cyrus. The second are Cyrus, the great person after he takes over Babylon, trying to describe how old the world is that Babylon represents, and he says, quote, when Cyrus entered Babylon in 5:39 bce, the world was old, more significant. The world knew its antiquity. It scholars had compiled long dynastic lists and simple addition appeared to prove that kings whose monuments were still visible had ruled more than for millenniums before, yet earlier were other monarchs, sons of Gods, and sold themselves. Demi gods who's rains covered several generations of present day short lived men. Even these were proceeded, the Egyptians believed by the gods themselves who held sway through long, eons before the universal flood. The Babylonians placed 10 kings, the least of whom ruled 18,000, 600 years, the greatest 43,200 years. Other peoples, he writes new this flood and told of monarchs, Nanacast Odium for example, who reigned in predelivery in times, meaning you know the times before the biblical flood. He continues the sacred history of the Jews extended through 4,000 years, modest, as were their fingers when compared with those of Babylon or Egypt. They recorded that one. Predelivery and patriarch almost reached the millennium mark before his death. Greek poets chanted a legendary history which was counted backwards to the time when the genealogies of the heroes ascended to the God. Each people and nation, each former city, state boasted of its own creation story with its own local God is creator and to quote,

Speaker 5:          00:35:53       he then goes onto diagram that in the 600 and 700 bce, there were quite a few rulers in quite a few of these old countries that became archeological buffs where they would go back and pay for the excavation of earlier rulers that ruled a thousand, 1500 years before them and in Egypt may have dressed similarly. That's the continuity of the Egyptian fashion. Look, my favorite story that really gives you an idea of the antiquity of things and how the peoples of this region understood it, knew it in a way that you don't normally think about, has to do with an archeological excavation that happened in the late 18 hundreds, early 19 hundreds in modern day Iran in a city through much of the historical period that was called Sousa. Sousa is a very old city, ancient city. It will be important in the Persian period. It will be important. After that period for a very long time of people called the elamites resided in Sousa and he was in a strata were the Eland Mike period, was that these archeologists began to uncover some of the greatest treasures and antiquities in near eastern history and they didn't belong there. They found, for example, the famous steel or steely take your pick of Hammurabi, something that is huge. I mean it's a giant seven foot tall or something heavy, big thing, and they find it there. What's it doing there? That should be in Babylon.

Speaker 5:          00:37:25       Now, if you think this deal of Hama Hammurabi is old circus, 17 hundreds bc or something like that, archaeologists then find something that's a good deal older than that. It's called the victory steel of sin. He was an Acadian King from the 22 hundreds BC. He, so by the time they were making the steel of Hammurabi, the victory steel of Naropa sin was half a millennia old. There were other antiquities that they found to all of them from elsewhere. They were the spoils, the loot, the stuff that the Ila Mites took back with them when they sacked Babylon, and in fact you could tell because somehow all this stuff was on display and below the original inscriptions in the original language explaining what this was, was an eland might inscription explaining when it was taken from the Babylonians as loot and spoils and as a piece of memorabilia commemorating a great victory.

Speaker 5:          00:38:33       I keep imagining a bunch of trophies in like a college or university or school trophy case, you know, commemorating the victories over the arrows over your school rivals the oaken bucket, the Apple Cup, the steel of Hama, Robbie, you know, that Kinda thing. And by the way, it wasn't just, you know, cultural artifacts that were taken in the famous elamite might invasion that happened in the 11 hundreds. They took the god of Babylon with them. They took, Martin, took with them the statue that represented the God. And this is one of my favorite things about ancient history is this idea sometimes that these statues that represented the gods were somehow connected to the god, him or herself. And sometimes were, I mean there were some beliefs that they were the gods, and so you'll see, for example, the Assyrians in a lot of their stone reliefs, when they're showing the conquest of some civilization or city, they've got the God that their soldiers are carrying away along with all of the loot.

Speaker 5:          00:39:32       And it's kind of symbolic when you think about it. It's a sign our God is stronger than your God. After all, we've got your God. And in a lot of these near eastern civilizations, the historians wrote that you can't reestablish some of these cities until the god is returned. So in other words, when Babylon gets sacked and the god is taken away, they can't do a big rebuilding thing until the God has brought back. We got your God. I mean, talk about rubbing your nose in a defeat there. I mean, I was trying to think about what the equivalent would be in the modern world. Certainly if somebody took over the United States, if the elamites had done it, they would have the statue of Liberty in their little museum there with a little notation underneath taken from New York City after we crushed the Americans. I love the elamites and would love to know more about them.

Speaker 5:          00:40:19       They're there. One of those peoples that just not a lot is known. What you can say for sure is that they are the great long standing urban power in what's now modern day or ron for thousands of years. The big contemporaries and the big power from that region that rival the Babylon's and the Assyrians in the Egypt's. There's usually a power in the north to north of Assyria, but that changes. It could be Matatani, it could be the hittites. It could be. You are to. Nonetheless, you have a relatively stable geo political balance going on for a long time, even through the ups and downs, and then that world begins to be consciously destroyed and that opens up the door to an instability where you know anything can happen and shocking things did. It starts with the absolute skyrocketing by historical standards of the military, dominance of the Assyrians.

Speaker 5:          00:41:22       Now you may be thinking, we were just talking about the needs a minute ago and now we've shifted over to the Assyrians and what does one have to do with the other, but it's their paths crossing that sort of up the stage for the next period. In western Asian history, the medes will turn out to be one of a couple of David's in this story, who will take down Goliath in order to understand what a big deal that is. You need to understand how big of a deal Goliath was in this story. The Assyrians are Goliath and they were transformed in the 700 bce from one of the great power, sometimes the greatest of the great power, sometimes not into the regional superpower, and as far as these people were concerned, the region was the entire world

Speaker 5:          00:42:09       and this quickly growing absolutely devastating new empire in terms of its military abilities, would have been the ones fighting the Greeks and the spartans at their mop. Ali had the medes and their allies not been able to take down this Goliath, and I got news for you. I don't think the neo was Syrian. Armies at their height would have beaten Alexander the great and his Macedonians. I'm not sure, but I don't think, but I think they crush the ancient Greeks of Athens and Sparta, and so maybe if the past that they're happily in the Greco. Persian wars really was a war for Western civilization. We should be thankful that there were people like the needs to take down the people who I think would have been the odds on favorite in any vegas betting pool to take down the ancient Greeks and for ADBC, he.

Speaker 5:          00:43:02       They weren't around in for ADBC in part because of these people. The medes who in the seven hundreds when the story really heats up and get strange or a people on the periphery of the known universe at the time to the Assyrians. The medes are sort of the eastern edge of the known galaxy and beyond those muddy and tribes with all their petty little kinglets are groups of half human, half monsters called the Lumen Monda in the Syrian animals, the Human Monda by the way in old acadian term that means the horde from who knows where and it's believed that this refers to the nomadic peoples of the step, the cultural forebears of the hands and the Turks and the Hmong goals and all those people.

Speaker 5:          00:43:53       In fact, the medes and the Persians were supposed to be able to speak to the Human Monda without the use of translators. How'd you like to be related enough to a people known as the horde from who knows where to be able to understand their language without anybody helping. Nonetheless, it's in this period right around 7:50 bce where you get a sort of an unusual happening in ancient history where a lot seems to happen in a relatively short period of time because in ancient history you get these long stretches where it seems like very little changes in 7:45 BC. He, with the arrival of a new Assyrian King, a guy named Tim [inaudible], the third, uh, Syria, begins to go on this sprint, maybe you could call it a historical sprint that will last until about six, 15, six, 12 bcee, and we'll be like, maybe you could say the last burst of rocket fuel of that historical era of that ancient world about to give way to the era of the Greeks and classical antiquity and all that kind of stuff and rockets it to the heights where the Assyrian army, for example, in say 700 BC, he or the equivalent of like the Roman empire, his armies at their height for their era.

Speaker 5:          00:45:16       The Assyrians will systematically smash the other great powers in that area and it's difficult by the way. They're powerful. They're sophisticated, they have a lot of money. Some of these places, the Assyrians often have to face not single states, but coalitions of states, big allies that allied simply to deal with the Assyrians and they lose most of the time. Anyway. I'll try not to geek out on the army too much, but it's the gold standard for the era. Richard Gabriel and Karen mets in their book from sewer to Rome, so to describe it in a nutshell in terms of just giving you a mental picture of the capabilities of an army from this era, you know the so called Biblical era when I was growing up, they right quote the Assyrian Army of the eighth century BC. He was comprised of at least 150,000 to 200,000 men and was the largest standing military force that the Middle East had witnessed to this time, and a Syrian combat field army numbered approximately 50,000 men with various mixes of infantry chariots in cavalry in modern times the size of an Assyrian field.

Speaker 5:          00:46:24       Army was equal to five modern heavy American divisions are almost eight Soviet field divisions. When it rained for battle, the army took up an area of 2,500 yards across and a hundred yards deep. The Assyrian army was also the first army to be entirely equipped with iron weapons and quote, boy, he doesn't that Soviet reference date me. Nonetheless, you get an idea that we're talking about armies that were exponentially larger than in the recent past in the bronze age, you know, narrow sin was putting like 6,000 guys into the field and thinking he had a lot of men. The Assyrians have multiple divisions of 50,000 each. They will smash the power of the mountain state of you. Rawr too. At one point during this period, that's where modern Armenia is. They will several times have to deal with Babylon. Another one of their great kings, Senaca rib takes care of that and then they just have to do it again and again.

Speaker 5:          00:47:24       Babylon is the thorn in the side perpetually of the Syria and the elamites always get in trouble with the Assyrians because they always support the Babylonians because after all, all of them would like to see the Assyrians cut down to size. Eventually the Assyrians will cut the elamites down to size to one of the most horrifying of all the Assyrian reliefs. And you know there's a lot of them in historians. Don't always know how to classify them. You can't tell if you want to say that. These are real scenes that they're showing. When you see these carvings which were probably painted at one time, and we're often displayed in the waiting room before you got to see the king, what are you looking at while you're cooling your heels, waiting to see the Assyrian King, the things he did to the people like you who may be turned against him.

Speaker 5:          00:48:12       Sometimes historians think that they're taking a sadistic sort of cruel love in this. Sometimes it's meant to be terrifying and they enjoy that Saddam Hussein style. Sometimes they think of it as a convention in the same way the Egyptians always seem to show them, you know, wearing certain kinds of clothing, whether or not they did anymore, it was an artistic convention. Showing people getting their heads lopped off is just, you know, if you go to a Syria, you expect to see the Assyrian things, that kind of deal. That's who we are and it's. It's a staple. Nonetheless. One of my favorite Assyrian reliefs shows the aftermath of the era where the Assyrians finally decided to deal with the ongoing Isla might problem. It shows the Assyrian King Osher, Bonnie Paul reclining on one of those wonderful oriental near eastern, you know, kinds of things that they used to lay down on like a couch where they would have somebody feed you grapes or something and he's sitting there drinking wine or eating food in a luxury, really relaxing sort of pace in a garden with palm trees, if I recall correctly, and there's a woman there with him and you get the feeling like he and that woman are together and then right over near by, up on the side of a wall or a post or a pillar is a head.

Speaker 5:          00:49:24       The head of the Ila Mike King, pickled or otherwise, and that woman who you think maybe is osher bonded, Paul's wife or maybe a royal concubine. Some historians think is the wife of that elamite. She having to be there with the person who killed him and have him looking on body list the whole time at the Assyrians just had this wonderful historical reputation for something that once again is cinematic. Now it's not color, it's not like Hurghada tests and all that. We don't have it in color, but it's a really scary black and white horror film. If you're on the receiving end of a series and violence, I should point out that, you know, focusing so much on geopolitics and the Syrian foreign policy may, you know, sort of colored the picture in a very negative way because to live in, in the Syrian city during this time period might've been awesome.

Speaker 5:          00:50:17       I might might've been the height of civilization, you know, it was, it was a society that was in some respects, one of the most literate at all time periods. It was wealthy. It was cultured. Might have been great to live in the Siri. You just didn't want to be on the wrong end of a, of foreign policy. And from about 7:45 BC to about the, you know, early six hundreds. A lot of people were and very few people came away doing very well after that. They systematically battered down the structures of this region. Now battering down the structures of the region. We're very important. If you wanted to kind of make it a mineable to being incorporated into a single political entity like an empire. Everybody's individualistic. Nature had to be curtailed somewhat. The problem will come when the unifying force that did this disappears to get an idea by the way of how many peoples we're talking about here and as a wonderful way to sort of contradict the earlier way the story was told, which was focusing on people's ethnicity a lot and to say, you know, the Assyrians were submitted and the Iranian people's, the medes and the Persians were Indo European, and all that is to realize when you deal with a place that is so filled with different ethnic groups, intermarrying living together, that it doesn't take very long for people's languages to change.

Speaker 5:          00:51:38       Which used to be the way we judged who was whom. It also means that the job of any unifying force that wants to turn all these different freedom loving groups into a single political entity is huge. Historian will durant tries to, you know, lay the foundation and and basically says, you know, just so you know, look at how many peoples there are in this part of the world and they're all interacting all the time and they're intermarrying and to me it's an ethnic melting pot. He says, quote, do a distant and yet discerning eye. The Near East in the days of Nebuchadrezzar would have seemed like an ocean in which vast swarms of human beings moved about in turmoil, forming and dissolve in groups in slaving are being enslaved, eating or being eaten, killing or getting killed endlessly behind and around the great empires, Egypt, Babylonia, Assyria, and Persia flowered this medley of half nomad.

Speaker 5:          00:52:35       Half settled tribes can marion's colleague Ian's Kapito oceans, but Finian's Ash Caymanians Messinians me own Ian's carions, like Ian's pamphlet to presidions Lakini, Ian's Philistines, Amorites Canaanites, Eda, Mites ammonites, the Moabites, and a hundred other peoples, each of which felt itself the center of geography and history. And would have marveled at the ignorant prejudice of a historian who would reduce them to a paragraph and a quote. I've got a bunch of historians who talk about how difficult the task is to Meld all these individualistic different peoples into a single political entity. Chester star writing in the middle of 19 sixties, put it this way, as he tries to sort of counterbalance this ruthless image the Assyrians have with the job they're trying to do, and he writes, quote, this spirit perhaps proves not so much that the Assyrians were in human monsters. As it shows the sternness required to break and harness the Near East. The Assyrian period was in reality, one of the greatest turning points in the civilized history of the area, and in this fact must be sought the justification for the booty and the tribute of empire. If Empire needs justification politically, such kings as tig left. The third took decisive steps towards uniting the Fertile Crescent. The next grade empire, the Persian reaped the benefit. And so could afford to exercise its sway in a more lenient style.

Speaker 5:          00:54:02       And quote, this is actually key to one of the things we've been talking about, the fact that even though the Greeks portrayed, you know, the Persians as sort of darth vader and the empire history outside the Greeks knew them as a comparatively tolerant empire, comparatively lenient, who were they being compared to the Assyrians, but it may have taken what the Assyrians did to make an empire that was docile enough for the Persians to treat them that way and have it all work out. I should also point out that there are quite a few historians that would suggest that the Assyrians have another legacy that we should potentially credit them with a much more noble sounding one. By the way, despite the horrific marketing and the frightful branding of the Assyrians, perhaps you might look at them during this time period, depending on your viewpoint. In more of a captain America style role, fending off the hordes of barbarism from swamping the civilized world with their, you know, murder and robbery. Because in the last years of the seven hundreds bce, the Uhlmann Monda breakthrough. And when they do, it will take the greatest military of that age to be able to resist and go up against what is a revolutionary military challenge. The first peoples in history probably who had to try to figure out how you defeat an army where everyone in the army is mounted on horseback.

Speaker 5:          00:55:45       Now. Our modern era is so different than how the dynamics of warfare worked for most of human history that at sometimes. And sometimes we have to reintroduce the more obvious things to sort of click a light bulb on in your head and remind you, oh yeah, we're talking about something this basic. For example, I and I love these military revolution periods. Can you imagine what it must have been like when the first cherry, it's attacked the first, you know, settled civilizations out there in the first time in army that was composed entirely of people walking, had to deal with something moving at the speed of a horse. And by the way, the way that they usually function was that the person inside the cherry and had a very powerful blow and shot arrows at people and never really tried to contact them at all until they were broken and running away so you couldn't catch them and they moved faster than you did.

Speaker 5:          00:56:38       And it changed warfare. And sometimes it's funny by the way, to read some of the, the, the records that have been kept that you have from some of these very early chariots societies and you realize how little they know about horses because people who knew anything about horses are these really high paid, important individuals and they have this hidden knowledge about, you know, here's how you take care of the feet of a horse and here's what you do. If they get bloat, I mean things that today, bazillions of people know back then. This was like privileged information, how you care for these things, right?

Speaker 5:          00:57:08       And the Horse in the subtle societies, the Egypt, the Babylon's in the series. At first you can see that they, that they don't know how to deal with the animal. I mean, there are wonderful little figurines and whatnot showing you know, the Egyptian, maybe it's like an Egyptian scout during maybe the first 200 years or something that the Egyptians were really trying to use horses and he's sitting way back over the tail of the horse, like he hasn't even figured out that that's not the right spot to sit in, but we take it for granted that this is an obvious thing, might not have been about 1000 bce. Cavalry first appears and it generally appears in, in, in, in a way that once again makes you think that these people are not very comfortable writing. And remember there are no saddles, there are no spurs, there are no stirrups.

Speaker 5:          00:57:56       I mean there's a lot of knack to knowing what you're doing here. And remember also that riding horses can be injurous and fatal if you're not used to it. Right? And none of these people are growing up doing a whole lot of horse riding and about 900 bce you can see carving showing a Syrian cavalry, which is probably, if you think about it, you know, cutting edge for the time period for the subtle civilizations and they send the cavalry riders out in Pairs because one guy has to hold the reigns for the other guy's horse. When the other guy decides he's gonna shoot or anything. In other words, they don't even feel comfortable enough to shoot and ride. You know, independently. You've got to have someone there to hold the horse. When you do it. Another words, you can watch the evolution, right? It's different when the armies from the Middle East, the ancient near east first run into the steppe troops. That will make up one of the dominant important tribal areas in world history for almost ever. I mean it's only the last couple hundred years that the Eurasian Steppe part of which you would refer to as Central Asia today, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, those kinds of places. Certainly in the last couple hundred years, those places have not been massively relevant to what's going on. I was reading a book not that long ago that it was going into all of the things that China and Russia have. The 17 hundreds see is only

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       a couple hundred years ago. All the things that they had to do to deal with the tribes on the step and it's crazy because, you know, when you look at history, you become very accustomed to watching the so called civilized society is just rolling over tribal peoples, you know, at a certain point in history once, once the momentum gets going and you have like Julius Caesar and Roman armies just rolling over Celtic society, you're already prepared to get to the part where the colonial Europeans, you know, show up on these distant shores and run into people with wooden clubs and bows and arrows. When you've got guns, I mean, it's a foregone conclusion, right? But you look at the step and you see the one place in history, we're for a number of different reasons. The odds are much more equal between settled and tribal peoples. First of all, it's likely that the odds in terms of fighting power in terms of manpower was probably pretty close. The settler societies had a lot more people, but a lot of them weren't fighters. The tribal societies usually had most of their mail people as fighters

Speaker 5:          01:00:27       and some females. By the way, the weapons technology was probably comparable. The the bose used by this step. People are famously some of the best ever made, but there would've been other things that the settled so called settled societies had in their favor, so probably a wash there, but imagine imagine the native Americans with a rough parody and fighting men and a rough parody in weapons technology. What would the native Americans have done to the settlers? Then? Who knows, but at least it's a fair fight added that the geographic conditions and the distance, right? This is a harsh environment. The steps sometimes if you're not adapted to it and it's a long way from point a to point b, no matter where you're going and you had a part of the world that was protected by step peoples for Millennia, where they maintained their way of life and were, shall we say, relevant, relevant, is a good non biased in any direction.

Speaker 5:          01:01:23       Word relevant to the societies and world powers around them and we've known them forever, right? We've seen wave after wave of these people come forward from the Magyars to the Turks, to the hands to the Hmong goals. This is the first period in recorded history where these people break through and someone's there to record it. There's always been a historical school of thought that chariot invasions from Central Asia long before this period represent earlier versions of these kinds of invasions, but this is the first one recorded where you get to see, you know, the kinds of step armies you will expect for the next 2000 years mounted on horseback with people who are. You know, as we said about the Spartans, that they were sort of a laboratory experiment to see if a culture could create a super soldier. The step societies are are kind of a laboratory experiment too.

Speaker 5:          01:02:14       If you put people on horseback from the time when they're toddlers and put a bow in their hand from not much later and have them ride all the time and do everything on horseback and use those bose continually and develop tactics where they never really come into contact with peoples. They don't want to come in. I mean, what do you end up with? And the answer is you end up with a weapons system that was so effective that even after guns were developed. Modern societies, we're having a tough time, pardon the pun, corralling these people even up until relatively modern times now when you think about how long that is, people trying to contend with the step people. Think about how much admiration we should have with the first people who had to try with no track record or experience. The Assyrians would develop a kind of a broad policy of dealing with these tribal step people that resembles what very sophisticated people who dealt with them for a very long time came up with the Chinese and the Byzantines for example.

Speaker 5:          01:03:17       Would you use a mix of diplomacy, intermarriage, warfare, and you know, keeping the tribes divided and fighting amongst themselves and the Assyrians did all this stuff too. They use some of these people as allies. Sometimes they'd have mercenaries who were, you know, people from these tribes, the tribes like the comedians in the [inaudible] and the various psychotic tribes and the massive ged. They have all these wonderful tribal confederations and one is scarier than the next, and if you're one of those settled society people, barbarians in air quotes always scared. You mean there was just something scary to settle people about. You know, people like the celts for example, the Athenians are no different. The various step peoples are no different. They're headhunters, for example, famously will drink from the skulls of their dead enemies. Make cups out of them and if you want to see how the wonderful continuity of step culture sometimes go.

Speaker 5:          01:04:10       They were doing this in in ancient times and they were doing this up until relatively, you know, goal type history, the drinking cups. Golfing was a perennial favorite, but that's just a cultural thing, right? I mean the Assyrians are hanging enemies, heads on walls so that they can watch their wife have relations with the Assyrian king who killed them. I mean, everybody's got their thing right. At the same time, you know these people are scary, they're effective, they are entirely mounted, which means they have amazing challenges to the militaries of the day because remember, you move at the speed of your slowest person. If you have an entire army mounted, the entire army moves at the speed of a horse. These are huge challenges and the Assyrians managed to ward off the worst of the attacks and in the sense, you know, you could make a case that they protected this entire area of civilization from marauding is scary peoples who were not going to leave it intact. And you know this because there were several invasions that did break through. There's a hoard of [inaudible] that will rape and pillage all the way down to Egypt before the Egyptians either buy them off or militarily turned

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       them back and they they go bouncing around the region like a sneaker ball. The fact that in a lot of these step armies, every single person was mounted was also revolutionary and huge in the armies of the day. If you were lucky, had 15 or 20 percent of their force mounted, sometimes quite a bit less. You still move at the speed of your slowest troops though if you don't. If you break the cavalry officer, you can operate independently. You'll have a nice small group of cavalry that gets overwhelmed by an entirely mounted forest, so nonetheless, and army with inventory moves at the speed of infantry. These armies that the settled societies in this geopolitical realm and Cheyenna are trying to deal with, move at the speed of a horse strategically on the map. That's a devastating thing to try to counter. The fact that the Assyrians could is a testimony to how great the greatest military of the world had ever seen was and how well lead.

Speaker 2:          01:06:14       Nonetheless, you could see how big the challenge was in seven. Oh, five bce Sargon the second, arguably the greatest king of Syria ever had will as an elderly man lead the Assyrian Army in person up to modern southeastern Turkey, near the border of neo hittite area called to ball and probably fighting in conjunction with some of these, uh, uh, neo hittite cities, Eurasian Steppe troops, comedians are skiff, eons and Sargon. The second will disappear with the army. The body will never be recovered. That is a very rare event. When the body is not recovered, the assumption is that nobody got out because one of the last things you will do is grab the king's body and spirited away. It's like saving the flag times 10, there'll be an Egyptian king to famously who was bones will stay on the battlefield and they, they, they ended up getting it later.

Speaker 2:          01:07:18       And mummifying a body that's been mutilated it on the battlefield for a few weeks. And you can still look at the mommy today and see, oh wow, they didn't get to him for awhile. So I on the second will never be found. I've often thought it's not a coincidence his son Senaca. We've never actually led a force in person when he was king. He left that to the generals. There's very important things in Nineveh that need taken care of. As we all understand. Anyone who could do that too, in the Syrian army at the height of a serious power is formidable indeed. Now, even though a Siri could protect some of this region, they couldn't protect all of it, and some of these tribes filtered down into the area where the people were ostensibly talking about, here are the medes, the Persians, the Elamites, the Zagros mountains, Iran. The peoples in this region are about to go through a one, two punch that will change them forever. The second of these punches will be delivered by

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       the Assyrians. Surprise, surprise. They were throwing punches everywhere. Why shouldn't this region get hit to the first will be delivered by these step people, these tribes of [inaudible] and [inaudible] who will at a certain point I said filtered. I thought that was a nice ambiguous way when you don't really know what happened, but the traditional idea is that the [inaudible] and the comedians attacked and broke into an assaulted the needs in a giant invasion. There's even a year associated with its 6:53 bce, which if you think about it's like 50 years after Sargon, the second dies, you know, up into ball, right? About 55, 60 years since these horse people first appeared and they're still managing to totally disrupt in a huge areas of this geopolitical ecosystem. Only use that word from now on. We all know what I mean, right? Filtered is a good word though, because it also allows room for a theory where warfare sort of doesn't dominate the reasoning behind why all of a sudden all these central Asian tribes moved into this part of Iran.

Speaker 5:          01:09:23       One of the things that's really changed since I first started studying the story is the concept that historians have about who these medallions were and what kind of state they had when I was growing up. The history is all made. It sound like the means were like the Babylonians and the Assyrians by this time, a centralized state with cities and governments and bureaucracies and all that. Historians today, and you know, I'm not one I just read the best, um, they make it sound much more like the current state of theory is that these needs are much more tribal than we had previously assumed. And if so might not be that much different than these [inaudible] Syrians coming into their area. This could be much more like a tribal relationship. What did we say? The medes and the Persians were second cousins who fought. Sometimes these step people's are like third cousins who fight a lot. Remember they could allegedly speak to each other without the use of a translator. When you're that close to another people. What appears to be a conquest from outside might be much more like dynastic marriage or someone having to change their alliance status or becoming a vassal of someone else or having to pay tribute Hurghada tissue might see all of that stuff as a version of slavery, but when he calls it slave, where we might be picturing something else entirely

Speaker 5:          01:10:41       erotic just says that the domination of the needs last 28 years and an interesting little in a tidbit that might confirm what he says is during that time period, the Assyrians, the Babylonians who keep records and who knows and mentioned the medes from time to time, start calling everyone who lives in that whole region, the womb and Munda and recess are gummy among others. Suggest that this might mean that the entire area has just been sort of overwhelmed and that you can't tell one tribe from another without a scorecard. Hurghada test if you want to go with this, tells one of his really fun stories. Um, you know, if you're like me, about how the medes eventually threw off the nomadic yoke that was oppressing them. And he tells a story about how they invited the [inaudible] and leaders to a banquet and then got them all drunk and then when they were also a knee created, they could hardly stand. They went in and killed them all,

Speaker 5:          01:11:46       I guess you could call that, you know, decapitating the enemy leadership literally. Or maybe the tactic is drunk and mass homicide, whatever you want to call it. It seems like a motif. Another one of these recurring sorts of things you see all throughout history and the writing and one of those, one of those aspects of the story that oftentimes professional historians will discount because after all we see this all the time. This sounds just like blah, blah, blah. And they're almost always right. Here's the weird part though. This is something that you actually see in history, confirm bubbly. The relationship between using alcohol as some sort of a trap to ensnare other people who then become vulnerable. I mean, we've seen this in recorded history like not that long ago. Native American tribes had this treatment done to them sometimes multiple times. In other words, what might it look in this case? Like a recurring motif might actually be a recurring historical occurrence. How would you tell the difference? In any case, it'll happen again in this story, which once again makes you say, okay, is this just a recurring motif or is this a tactic that worked last time? So we're trying it again. Nonetheless, somehow the medes regain in a freedom of action from these people who were then thrown out, leaving behind another wonderful ethnic strain of the central Asian bloodline that will run through Iran over the ages and that will be added to with new blood, sometimes, tragically from time to time.

Speaker 5:          01:13:21       The guy who is supposedly the king of the medes during this period of domination by the [inaudible] is a mead name. See accessories,

Speaker 5:          01:13:31       carotids his credits him with totally reorganizing the military of the medes. He says that because the accessories becomes the first Asian leader too, you know, separate and army into component parts, you know, archers and Spearman and cavalry. He says before that they all fought together in a chaotic mass, which is not true at all, but some historians think he's preserving some sort of a memory of this important medean ruler who reorganize the military and made it much more powerful and considering what he was about to do with it. There seems to be some historical evidence for the medes all of a sudden becoming very formidable indeed. Right about the same time. When the great traditionally great power in that region gets mortally wounded by Assyria, and we alluded to this earlier, part of a serious laying waste to all these, you know, competitors for their superpower status, right?

Speaker 5:          01:14:30       There's not going to be anybody that even gets to put up a little resistance. The elamites, once again, get on the hit list for doing the same thing. They always do. Babylon revolt against the Syria. Elom helps Babylon. As soon as the Assyrians take care of Babylon, they come for the elamites and this happens under the last of the Great Assyrian rulers is Bonnie, Paul Oscher, Bonnie Paul, who's who's a very long ruling guy, and at the start of his reign, the empire could not be at a higher place by the end of his reign. You know he's writing these. Woe is me tales. What did I do to have the gods turned against me? Everything sucks, you know, but all die soon, at least kinds of. I'm in a writings. Syria will go from the height of its fortunes to 1945, Berlin follow the Third Reich devastation, never to rise again in a very short period of time and some have argued that part of the reason why is because of what they did to the people around them. They destroyed the other powers who might have acted as barriers against new rising ones. Whether the new rising ones are [inaudible] and [inaudible] from the Eurasian Steppe, or whether they're an obscure tribal people known as the medes, who all of a sudden they're really getting powerful and well led who otherwise would have been dealing with the Ila Mites, but the elamites gets smashed by Asher, Bonnie Paul in 6:46 BC. He and the devastation is arguably mortal.

Speaker 5:          01:16:09       We already mentioned a scene from the aftermath of this isla might final solution when Asha, Bonnie Paul's lying on his couch with that woman there and then the severed head, you know, up on the pillar of their wall. That's, you know, part of the aftermath of dealing with the elamites this way. Asha, Bonnie, Paul Leeds, the greatest Syrian army, all the way. It's a long way again to susa devastates elom as his scribe, writing for himself recounts, quote for a distance of one month in 25 days. March. I devastated the districts of Ylem. I spread salt and thorn Bush there to injure the soil. Sons of the king's sisters of the king's members of royal family, young and old prefix governors nights. Artisans, as many as there were inhabited and male and female, big and little horses, mules, asses, flocks and herds more numerous than a swarm of locusts. I carried them off as boody to Assyria, the dust of Sousa of Murdoch to of how and of the other cities. I carried it off to a Syria in a month of days. I subdued elam in its whole extent, the voice of man, the steps of flocks and herds. The happy shouts of Mirth. I put an end to them in its fields, which I left for the asses, the gazelles and all manner of wild beasts to people and quote. The Assyrians were thorough.

Speaker 5:          01:17:46       They even removed the bones of the old going back to ancient times. Isla might rulers from their tombs and took them back to a Siri with dilute my story in a tea. Olmsted says they put them in particularly awful spots so that they would get no rest ever again, laying in a foreign land and paying an eternal price for their enmity to Assyria. That may have happened in the deep, misty errors of the past. I mean, we said to you earlier that the elamites conquered the United States. They take the statue of Liberty back as a prize of war to be displayed. Will. The Assyrians wouldn't stop at the Statue of Liberty. They'd steal our constitution. They take the Washington monument, they sniff out the flame of John f Kennedy's grave and take the bones with them.

Speaker 5:          01:18:37       The Assyrians were sort of setting the bar for this region. People like the Babylonians who come afterwards will be just as brutal, like they're trying to imitate whatever the standard of the day is, but the standard of the day is, even today, I mean, try making a movie out of it. It's gonna be. It's gonna. Be a cable one for sure. I mean the story almost had tells of the parade. Is that a good word? When Osher, Bonnie, Paul and his army arrived back home in Nineveh, displaying the loot and the prisoners and meeting out punishment by the way to all and sundry is frightful. First of all, the head of that elamite ruler that will be sitting up on us. You're bonded. Paul's wall or what have you, was transported from Susa on foot around the neck of the Ila might general imagine how freaky that would have been to live through who did the walking.

Speaker 5:          01:19:33       Shane's supposedly, and then the various generals are brought out and punished, and there's a psychological twists to a Syrian punishment. By the way, that is part of kind of what the Persians will sort of do away with. Here's what 18 olmsted writes, and I'm going to try my best at some of the pronunciations of these Mesopotamian names. They are wonderful. He writes, quote Osher, Bond I. Paul was about to leave our Bella for Nineveh and the severed head of the Ila might ruler was entrusted to his general dot, New News, neck for transport. As the musicians lead the gasoline procession into Nineveh, the terrible site crazed how Mandara and Nabu domonique the ambassadors who had received their commissions from the dead monarch. One tour his beard, the other thrust, his girdle sword into his bosom. Apulia son of Nabulu Shalam and grandson of the famous Mera Doc Bala. Don was extradited from elom. Manu done nu new and Nabulu Shalam.

Speaker 5:          01:20:36       The Gumbo Ulu chief tins had spoken blasphemy against the Assyrian Gods and for this crime they had their tongues pulled out by the roots and were skinned alive. The horrible scene is represented on one of the reliefs, although strangely enough, olmsted writes, the names have never been filled in. The blanks left for the purpose. The new new was placed on the rack and slaughtered like a lamb. His brother, Sam Guna, when Appalachia were slain and their flesh distributed among the surrounding lands. Now Bu naive and Bella tear, sons of Nablus, Schumer were forced to crush the bones of their father and the head of the Ila Mike King found its final resting place over the gate, which led to assure and quote, osher being a primary Assyrian city. The forcing the sons to crush the bones of the father is one of those really psychologically horrible things. And you'll see this in other occasions.

Speaker 5:          01:21:29       The Babylonian King, for example, who supposedly once he took Jerusalem, took the ruler the king and forced him to watch the slaughtering of his two young sons in front of his eyes and then had his eyes put out. So that the last thing he saw was that, I mean, those are the extra little cruelties that just seem, well, that just seemed calculated to subdue somebody who's will to resist, but you could easily see how it might have the opposite effect. You could see how, uh, people coming after this time might be able to make all sorts of political hay selling themselves as the alternative to this kind of cruelty. And you can also see why when a Syria foul, there were not a lot of tears cried for what was gone. In fact, you know, even the biblical prophets are rejoicing. As I was trying to come up with some sort of analogy to try to define the stakes here with what's about to happen. All I could think of in my uncreative mind was the idea of the United States over the next five or so years. Somehow, you know, with jaw dropping, astonishing events fell apart or imploded

Speaker 5:          01:22:54       and a broken to some kind of a civil war ended up getting involved in maybe a foreign war at the same time. I mean, he never know how these things are gonna turn. Remember how you felt if you were old enough to remember what the 9:11 attacks look like

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       on live television while you watched them? There's almost nothing positive that comes out of something like that, but one of the few things that was in my mind was as you watched it, you were reminded that the most astonishing things not only can happen but will happen. They're like earthquakes. You know there's going to be a big one. You just don't know when you know there's going to be some massive jaw dropping historical event in the future. You just don't know the date ahead of time, like a nine slash 11, but when you watch that happening, that astonishment is how mankind has failed over and over and over again. As you look back on it, there's about to be an astonishing moment in this story. It's not really a moment, five to 15 years. It just appears astonishing now, but it's akin to the United States imploding.

Speaker 2:          01:23:55       Really. I think it's more than the Soviet Union falling, but a little less than the modern United States going away. Nonetheless, if the United States did go away in the next five years, what does the international situation look like then mean what world instantly springs up to replace such an important cog and how does that go? This is actually the world that is going to exist as soon as this story that must be, you know, one of the great events in all human history, but we don't know because we don't have a [inaudible] there to give it even with a bunch of lies and exaggerations and untruths that may have filtered in over the hundreds of years. We don't have his version or anyone like him to explain it to us. We liked the color. I brought at this, by the way, promised he was going to tell this story in one part of his histories and then never did or didn't come down to us or something.

Speaker 2:          01:24:50       Have a few tourists, Babylonian sources and that's it. In fact, the stuff you thought you could count on, like those wonderful Assyrian, you know, pronouncements by the king of kings. I went in there, I planted thorn bushes. I killed everybody. That ends in like 6:30, nine bce, ominously, and mysteriously all of a sudden, what the heck's going on? I love the different ways that historians try to describe this to. One one historian says it was unclear what was happening. Author Mark Healey explained the importance though of this period silence because he says quote, and it is in the silence of those years that is written the fate of the Assyrian Empire, and so the important stuff is happening. We just don't know much of what it is. Open to interpretation is how another historian put it, but here's what basically goes on. Osher, bond, I Paul's rain. At the end, you start to see things fraying. It begin to see places that were under a serious control on the on the margins break free. A lot of historians think that it's rather telling that all of a sudden you can have these skiffy and tribes riding rough now in areas where the Assyrians used to keep them out. It must mean that they can't. While no

Speaker 5:          01:26:04       one is really paying a lot of attention. The medes are beginning to fuse sort of ends, and it's unclear how they did this with the elamites. Civilization. Could have been peaceful, could been warlike, could've been diplomatic marriage, but it's making both civilization stronger. And Osher, Bonnie Paul dies and his sons go to war with each other. Now, this is not uncommon in Assyrian royal succession, but this is coming at a particularly bad time because all of a sudden the Babylonians are resurgent again. They've got a new dynasty. They've got an army that is modeled. It's, it's, it's, uh, not as effective copy of the Assyrians, the Assyrians copy, the Babylonian civilization not quite as well as the Babylonian original. And the Babylonians copied the Assyrian military. Though it's not quite up to the originals standards either, but when you've been fighting one half of your army against the other, which is what the Assyrians were doing in a civil war, that's why they're so ruinous.

Speaker 5:          01:27:07       You know, you have outside powers starting to loom over you. And what do you do with your army? You divide it in half and fight it against each other. Worse possible thing that could happen. And then the Babylonians starting in about 6:16, start sending out an army, taking some of these border cities between Assyria and Babylon, and then the war heats up a little bit in there fighting back and forth, and the Assyrian Army seems to be a shadow of its former self. But you could see how strong it still is because they're holding their own against these Babylonians, pushing them back, sometimes chasing them back sometimes, but it's all they can handle. And then in like six slash 15 bce, the medes jump in from the east and the north, they start taking cities in the east. The next year, the medes come forward under their king, see accessories and advances on, you know, one of the capitals, Nineveh, they can't take it because Nineveh is this massively fortified, probably the most fortified city west of China in this whole human history up to this point.

Speaker 5:          01:28:15       I mean, just an incredible feat. Human Marvel and it pushes these means sideways. They just can't deal with it right now. But unfortunately for the Assyrians, if you can't go out there and defeat that muddy and army, they can do whatever they want so they go sack in nearby city that's not as well defended. It just happens to be one of the great, you know, once upon a time, a Syrian capitals vital, connected to their religion and their God and and morale and everything else. It's a big deal. At the last minute, the Babylonians run up to be a part of it. This is a famous event. They, they, they don't want to allow the media to take this important city by themselves, be left out of the spoils, the reputation, everything, but they arrived too late with their army. The means of already the place, maybe

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       rushing the attempt so that they'd beat the Babylonians mayor. They treated the way the Assyrians would have treated it, and it's a horrific event. The Babylonian King and the Medean king pledged their friendship to each other. As osher burns in the background and the killing continues in, the slaves are being dragged off and all of a sudden a week into Syria has Babylon and the medes working together and advancing on Nineveh in six, 12 bcee. If this wasn't bad enough at the last minutes, allegedly not everybody says this, but the standard belief is at the last minute, a horde of skiff, Ian's in a rides in the wild northern horsemen and joins both the medes and the Babylonians in this last assault upon this greatest of West Asian military fortresses, and together they take it down, had to fight three battles on the plains, supposedly before they even got a chance to get near the walls with this last old aging damage, lion of a serious swatting them away and fighting well as long as they could

Speaker 2:          01:30:22       the Babylonian king in the terse style. You know that those people wrote in, described what he did to what he calls the land of [inaudible], which is their word for Syria. And by the way, notice how he's couching this in terms of liberation from the, you know, a Syrian yoke. The record, say, quote, I slaughtered the land of [inaudible]. I turned the hostile land into heaps and ruins the Assyrian who since distant days had ruled over all the peoples and with his heavy yoke brought injury to the people of the land, his feet from a cod. I turned back his yoke. I threw off and quote, and you have a basic problem when, when discussing events of the past like this, if we're discussing something from recent history, say the end of the third, right, hit the second world war, all that emotion is still felt right.

Speaker 2:          01:31:17       You get a real feel for the kinds of things historians don't want to touch. Once you get back a certain distance, some day they're not going to look at the Nazis as the kind of evil that we do. They're going to somehow say, well, they were on the far end of the spectrum of what people did then, which is kind of what a lot of modern ones would say about a Syria. They're not doing anything anybody else isn't doing. They just may be at the far end of the spectrum of, you know, conduct. It's all kind of relative, right, but you could certainly see the anger and vengeance in the people that goes beyond mere, you know, the taking of and slaves

Speaker 5:          01:32:00       and the things that have motivated soldiers sometimes in the heat of battle at all times. This involved some payback

Speaker 5:          01:32:08       story. Mark Vandy, Maru explains that you can still see at vengeance today mean there's an eternal bit of payback that was done. He writes, quote, the conquerors set out to destroy the cities of Assyria, taking revenge for the humiliations they had suffered a serious hands on wall reliefs of kings, Senaca Reeb and Asher, Bonnie Paul in Nineveh, for example. They identified the representations of the kings with the help of the inscriptions accompany them and ritually destroyed them by cutting out the ears and eyes. These were not random acts of mutilation in the detailed depiction of Asha Bonnie Paul's defeated the Elamites, for example, only the face of a soldier cutting off the head of the king of Ilan was similarly destroyed probably by the medes who saw the elamites as their ancestors. Likewise, the records of loyalty oaths that King Esr had on had forced Medea and body guards to swear and which had been stored at cal who were smashed. The palaces were burnt down only after the lengthy task of defacing images and destroying symbols of submission to a Syria had been completed and quote. If you go to the British Museum today and look at the Assyrian reliefs, you can see, you know the defacing done by some angry vengeful and probably rightfully so soldier as they took down with Syria piece by piece, but stunningly quickly by historical standards.

Speaker 5:          01:33:38       And while there may be no hurghada tests to give color to this story, there is one of the most, I guess for military history fans, one of the most colorful sections of the Old Testament of the Bible that deals with the fall of the Syria and I'm sure a Syrian descendants and people who are big Assyrian fans think this is very unfair sort of propaganda. Again, it's just they're bad luck to get bad pr sometimes in the Bible and the biblical Prophet Niamh was prophesizing supposedly that you're going to get it. And then once they did get it, he was sort of saying, see, this is what you get. Now what's kind of interesting about nay, unlike some of these other prophets, it's, there's a decent chance he was a contemporary. A lot of this stuff was put together in the hellenistic period later, you know, from earlier stories are all kinds of things dealing with that era.

Speaker 5:          01:34:28       But some of this goes back and it's tough to know and historians argue, but it's possible that this prophet named guy was maybe even a predecessor to some of these events. So who knows, you know, I won't get into something like that. I just found it interesting because when he recounts what happens, first of all, he gives you the color and tells you a little bit about the story in a, in a religious sort of framework. Still doesn't sound like Hurghada just there's a religious tone to it. But at the same time it's very colorful. So he describes, for example, you know what the battle is like after prophesizing, that you're going to get it for a long time, and he says, quote, he that shatters in pieces has come up against the guard, the wall guard the way good thy loins make dice strength, the utmost.

Speaker 5:          01:35:11       The Shield of his heroes is red. His warriors are colliding scarlet. They prepare the chariots today that cherry had horses are eager. The Cherry, it's rage in the field. They rushed to and fro in the plazas. Their appearance is like that of torches. They dart about like lightning's. He reads out the list of his nobles in their eagerness. They stumble, they hastened to reach the walls. The battering ram is made ready. And then they, um, describes the unleashing of the rivers. I guess the dams were broken or rerouted or they reroute the course of the rivers or what have you to help undermine the walls. That's not that unusual a tactic. But with a big city like this, not a small engineering feat. And the prophet named says, quote the reverse sluices or opened the palace, walls are crumbling. The Queen is stripped of her clothing. They are leading her away captive.

Speaker 5:          01:36:05       Her handmaidens Moan like doves, upon their breasts, they are beating Nineveh was a tank of water from it. They are now escaping stand, stand. They cry, not one of them looks backward and then he basically tells everybody to take back the stuff that a Syria took from them and that their housing in this immensely wealthy city. He says, quote, take either spoil of silver, take either spoil of gold. There is no end to the store and abundance of all goodly objects. She is empty and void and waste hearts melt, knees shake. There is pain in all loins and Pale. Have waxed all the faces and then he does a little trash talk, gloating, you know, where he says, where are the, you know, great lions now and all the people who took all this stuff. And then like again, so many of the people during this era, this was seen to involve, you know, a little proof that their God was superior.

Speaker 5:          01:37:05       Or in the case of some of these people, by this point in history, the only God a name says, behold I am against thee, says y'all way of hosts that I layer I will burn with smoke. They're young. The sword shall devour. I will cut off, die, pray from the earth. No more be heard. They messengers voices and he continues to rub it in and basically blame this on Karma if you will. Woe to the bloody city full of lies and robbery, the crack of the whip and the thunder of the rumbling. We'll the prancing horse and the bounding chariot, the horseman mounting and the flash of stored the gleam of spear and a massive slain a heap of corpses. There are no end to the dead bodies for the many infidelities of the well favorite, the

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       mistress of incantations who sold states for her wicked deeds and clans through her incantations. Behold say, if the outweigh of host I am against thee, I will strip the UAE clothing and show that I shamed the nation's filth. I will cast upon thee and disgraced the. I will set the up as a warning. All who see the shall flee shall cry, desolate Nineveh, who shall be whale her end quote. Well listen, they may not have a ton of dramatic stuff from the Near East during this time period, but that's awesome. I mean all history aside, that's awesome stuff and it does give you a feel for the emotion of the time period. We may think you know that it's all been drained, but that's somebody who is clearly thinking that is Syria is reaping what she sewed. Again, I pity the poor Syrian people who have to live with one piece of horrible pr, making it down through the errors, the most widely read book in history in Europe. People get some negative pr in it.

Speaker 2:          01:39:03       The last two Syrian king is rumored is a good way to put it. There's not enough information to know on this is rumored to have as the enemy was closing in pile all of his worldly possessions that were in his palace around him and the gold and the silver and have family members killed and unix and concubines thrown on. You know, the, the, the pile of stuff with him. And then have it all set a light with him sitting in the middle of it. There's a scene like that in the Lord of the rings to apparently in this time period. It happened a few times, probably it was a Motif they certainly referred back to for a short time and a Siri and successors state. Maybe you could call it, maybe you could call it the last gasp of resistance. Tried to make a stand, but by six, oh, five. That was destroyed to and the Assyrians will turn into a people that never disappeared, but who's destruction was so massive and so sustained and so total that they seem like they did.

Speaker 2:          01:40:03       You will hear a Syrians trying to tell the world, still today we're still here and try to fight that idea that every last one of them was killed in the, in their version of a holocaust. You know, at the end of that era. Well, it's not true, but you could certainly say that within a very short period of time, those massive, you know, top of their era cities and fortresses. We're almost unrecognizable in a famous passage. The Greek General xenophon with his 10,000 Greeks fleeing a Persian civil war will get chased all the way through what's now northern Iraq. He will come upon these great massive cities by their standards of the day, simply, you know, rotting in the dust, deserted, but the walls are so high and the workmanship on the streets and everything so modern that he doesn't understand where it came from. The locals don't know anything about a Syria. They think the medes built it. In other words, within 200 years these cities are lying in ruins, are still larger than almost anything new being built at that time and nobody even remembers that they were a Syrian. The account by xenophon of these ghost cities. By the way, I've spoken about them before. It's the ultimate statue of liberty in the sand sort of historical moment. You know what I mean when I say that right? The end of the planet, of the apes where Charlton Heston believes he's been on a distant planet the whole time and the very last scene in the movie, he looks into the distance, you know, with the surf crashing against it, he sees the statue of Liberty three quarters buried in the sand.

Speaker 2:          01:41:54       If you could take an Assyrian individual from three, four, 500 years before xenophon lived and bring him forward or her forward in a time machine so that she could hang out there, you know, by the ruins of Nineveh with xenophon and what, what, what were run through her head, what would run through your head if you could go forward in a time machine and see our ghost cities someday.

Speaker 2:          01:42:22       And I marveled at the size. I mean 200 years later, xenophon says, and he can't really lie. There's a lot of people who know, you know, what xenophon's talking about here and have seen it and could call him a liar. I mean he says the base of the fortification, he's camping bias. Fifty feet broad and 50 feet high and then has a brick wall 50 feet broad. And another hundred feet high on top of that and the circumference of the fortifications is 18 miles. He says there are some people sort of, you know, little like refugees and small villages and semi-nomadic groups of people camping by. But that city used to have hundreds of thousands, maybe a million people living there. That's a ghost city from a dead era by the times and uh, funds. They're only a couple of hundred years later. And when a series of falls, it's like that moment we spoke about earlier, what would happen if the United States disappeared in five or 15 years? What's the world then look like without that, you know, senator spoke of the wagon wheel anymore. It's hard even to think for people born in the last 20, 30 years maybe of any other sort of reality. Maybe that's the case for the people who lived through it, maybe they were blinking and just waking up to a new day. It really does have sort of an end of the Second World War. So to feel like everything's been devastated in whole bunch of people

Speaker 5:          01:43:52       who had allied together for this common interest of taking down the Assyrian Empire. We're now staring over the rubble wondering who gets what and all of a sudden, like in 1946 in a Europe, especially, allies were turning into potential adversaries very quickly. There were four know. If we look at this as a encapsulated little micro world here, geopolitically speaking, which is how I look at these stories. Sorry for all you folks who'd like a little bit more culture or religion. Nonetheless in this geopolitical setup, we really have four great powers. Now you go from one, hey, hegemonic power, Syria to Babylon, picking up a lot of, uh, Syrian territory in this whole deal. By the way, you'll also have the medes obviously doing the same thing. You know, moving into territory in the north of Syria, owned. You have Egypt always a great power if they can be, but not that long ago, you know, under Syrian domination like everyone else, they start moving towards the modern day area around Israel and in there.

Speaker 5:          01:44:59       And they are a player. And finally, if at fourth power called Lydia, Lydia is the power that's now in modern day Turkey for the most part, like everyone else, they benefited from the Assyrians going away. They were able to move and expand into other areas. They are generally credited with the one's inventing metal money at least in the western world. And you will begin to see at least in the longterm view of things, all sorts of conflicts breaking out now as all these new powers sort of vie with each other. The Egyptians and the Babylonians for example, we'll go at it, you know, several times trying to figure out, you know, is anybody gonna Conquer anybody? Where's the border going to be? And all that kind of stuff. And a lot of the littler states just get totally screwed in this deal. It's a little like the cold war where some states in the middle try to decide, do I side with the Soviets or do I side with the Western?

Speaker 5:          01:45:59       And then if you screw up, all kinds of bad things can happen. That's exactly what happened to poor Judah. That was sacked by the Babylonian King. During this era for continually swaying sort of between the two powers that were vying for them, Babylon on one side and Egypt on the other, and finally exasperating the Babylonian king to the breaking point. There are Jews in Iraq today whose ancestors were a part of the Babylonian King, you know, taking them out of the city of Judah that he was just destroying. That's where by the way, Solomon's temple was destroyed by the Babylonians. Again, earning them bad pr in one of the most important per books of all time. The medes will scare the Babylonians to the point where the Babylonians will build something called the median wall to hopefully slow them down. And xenophile installed that to about 150 years later.

Speaker 5:          01:47:02       It was a wall that supposedly ran across the narrow part of the division between the Tigris and Euphrates river. So you'd have the river on two sides and then this wall in the middle and xenophon says that 200 years later it was made a burnt bricks laid in bitumen. It was 20 feet thick, a hundred feet high and said to be 60 miles long. It is quite close to Babylon and quote again, if he's lying about that, there's a lot of people who would know that he was, he'd have a reputation for that, that would follow him unto our own time. Now the medes will famously go to war with the Lydians and this is when some of her [inaudible] really Hurghada test has a little bit of, um, a horror story and Alfred Hitchcock side to him sometimes or maybe just the people he talks to happen to because during this little period which will really only last like 40, 45 years between the fall of the Assyrians and the rise of the Persians, there's going to be incidents that are eerily similar and you start to wonder whether the guide telling you about them or the people existing in this era have a certain weakness for that sort of incident.

Speaker 5:          01:48:16       In this case, Heraclitus says, this is how the war with the medes and the Lydian started. There were some skiff. Ian's who were hunters for the Medean king, that guy see accessories, right? And normally they'd bring back food, but one time they show up, Heraclitus says empty handed in front of the accessories, who supposedly Hurghada test says, has this awful temper freaks out and starts abusing, including so physical abuse. One must imagined him kicking maybe these skinny and archers. Now the skiff, Ian's were never known to have particularly non excitable temperaments, shall we put it that way? Is that fair? And Hurghada to says that they went and in their anger, killed one of the boys probably from the royal court that the Medean king had sent to learn archery from these same skiff. Ian's wow, they're great archers. Let's send some of the royal boys out there and they can learn how to shoot bows like an ancient Eurasian Steppe Archer.

Speaker 5:          01:49:18       And they killed one of these boys Herata to says and cut him up like the game that they normally give to the Medina king showed up, gave him the food, watched him eat it. Hahaha. It's like putting urine into someone's beer before you give it to them. The king finds out, you know, goes after them. They run to Lydia and then the median king says, I want those skit. The ones who cut up that boy and made me eat him and Herat at this says that the king of Lydia said, no, can't have him. Boom war. Now we'll run into Hurghada telling a similar story with an even greater psychological twist very soon after this. Nonetheless, this war with the medes and the Lydians have gone for like five years. Hurghada to says, and we'll end with an. You know, we have a fact here. We can play with something that's real. We don't have to say. He says, she says this historian claims we've heard from Herat at this. There is a solar eclipse that happens on May 28th, five, 85 BC. He

Speaker 5:          01:50:21       and at the time that solar eclipse happened, which by the way Hurghada says a Greek predicted claiming it was the first time that had ever been done. I'm sure the Babylonians probably pulled off a few of those correctly. Who knows? Modern astronomers. Of course I have no problem going back and with precision. Calculating the date of that past astronomical event, which is why we have a rare confirmable fat at this point in the story, but when that eclipse happened, the medes and the Lydians happen to be fighting a battle and Hurghada to says, as it was warming up, as the battle was getting hot, there goes the sun.

Speaker 5:          01:51:02       Now, if you are an ancient person with the religious beliefs, you must imagine many of these ancient people had. There are few atheists in the ancient world and sometimes it can be very superstitious indeed, as you might imagine. Now you're involved in a battle man killing man. You know, both sides of almost certainly had sacrifices and the omens examined and they're looking at the liver and saying, is this a good day to attack? And all these kinds of things, and then in the middle of the battle of the sun goes out, what are you going to think? Well, as you might imagine, the medes and the Lydian stopped fighting in the heat of the fighting. They stopped fighting. We're talking about tens of thousands of people on each side and then everybody just stops.

Speaker 5:          01:51:53       That's the way it's portrayed anyway, but think about it this way. If an eclipse is really going to stop a battle, it's going to happen fast because the eclipse doesn't last that long. The piece was brokered. We are told by another of the great powers, Babylon and also the clique. Ian's involved, maybe you would call them a midsize power in that region. Regional power in that part of the world and the deal sealed. We are told in the traditional way, although the Greeks did it a little differently. We're not told how both rulers slipped their skin and suck blood from each other. Also gave daughters and whatnot in marriage. That's the part I left out. Two of the deal when the Babylonians and the medes sign, that agreement probably the same way, a little vampiric blood sucking to go along with it outside of Asher. They destroy that a

Speaker 2:          01:52:45       Syrian city. They also married off daughters to each other and I mean it was one of these things where all of a sudden the families are related as though that's really going to stop anything given the history. Nonetheless, they did the exact same deal here, got a few daughters we can spread around, got some blood weaken, suck, and and, and forever friends.

Speaker 2:          01:53:06       That bottle is known as the battle of the Haley's river or the battle of the eclipse sometimes. Now one thing that it's worth pointing out from this period because it's going to matter in the north west and very west parts of modern day Turkey, Anatolia, as it was called earlier, our settlements and villages and cities of Greeks, they're called Ionian Greeks, but Greeks of one kind or another being, you know, such a seafaring, people around that region head in a colonized that whole area a very long time ago. And they had relationships with the Greeks, you know, on the mainland where places like Athens are, for example. You've got to imagine trade routes back and forth, people going back and forth. In fact, the part of the Greek world that was located in modern day Turkey at this time was the more sophisticated, the more cultured than more learned. Uh, the Greeks in Athens and Sparta might say, the more feminine, the more corrupted, the more lazy, the more opulent, you know, connected to all that eastern opulence as they were. See how that motif works. Nonetheless, those Greeks in Anatolia will become a big part of, you know the problem because they are the part that links Asia back to the Greek mainland and the Greek mainland has an interest in how their, shall we call them cousins, second cousins, how they're doing

Speaker 2:          01:54:39       at the time. The Battle of the eclipse figures out what's going on between the Lydians and the medes. Those Greeks are for the most part, subject to the Lydian king that's going to change. That's going to change for everybody.

Speaker 2:          01:54:54       What's about to happen in this region that will affect the Greeks and everyone else is every bit as shocking and unexpected as the fall of Assyria was. And it's interesting that they will happen within a reasonably historically speaking, short period of time from each other. You have to imagine that analogy. We had the United States disappearing in five to 15 years and what would the world look like after that? Well, what if I told you that within, you know, another 20 or 30 years after that one country that you'd never, you know, some out of the way place had taken over the entire planet. That's how this analogy works. When we start trying to realize that somehow this people call the Persians will first get their control over the means and how that even happens. I mean, recess are gone. Me, the author has a great line where he points out that, you know, between the fall

Speaker 5:          01:55:44       of the last great Assyrian monarch and the rise of Cyrus the great. There's no mention of these Persian people in any text, in any politically significant way. They are virtual. Nobody's and within a generation they're running the show for everyone in this part of the world. How did that happen? Judging from the overwhelming number of historians from ancient times all the way to the, you know, the latest, often contrarian writings, the lion's share of the answer seems to have something to do with this incredible leader. Cyrus the second also called, as we said earlier, Cyrus the great.

Speaker 5:          01:56:28       There are lots of stories by the way, and some of them are fantastic. One of her auditees is best is one of the ones you know he tells about the rise of Cyrus, but you have to remember something. This person, cyrus the great is to Persian and Iranian history, sort of what George Washington is to American history, what King Arthur is to British legend. I mean this is a legendary figure and because there so little that talks about him during his rise to power historians are in a really thrust into the detective role trying to figure out what it is you know is going on. I liked the way historian peer brand kind of tries to explain what sort of assumption she should maybe build into this and I'm not a historian, so he was writing as a historian trying to explain to a lay person like yours truly.

Speaker 5:          01:57:15       Let's hope the layperson understood. But he kind of said, listen, if something that appears to happen out of nowhere, but it's unlikely that it could, you should assume that there was stuff bubbling up under the surface, you know, a foundation taking place. But that's hidden from our eyes through the historical veil, right? So when a cyrus the great all of a sudden takes over the muddy and empire and it looks like a lightning bolt strikes, it's probably safe to assume things had been leading up to this somehow for awhile, for a long time. One of the things historians like to suggest was percolating beneath the scene that you couldn't see with something like rot, I guess you could say maybe moral rot. This is something that is, you know, part of earlier histories. And because it's impossible to quantify, I mean we could even ask these questions a day, is there any truth to the idea?

Speaker 5:          01:58:04       And we have by the way, that the older generations in tougher times are tougher than we are today. If there is any truth to that because that had been true in the past. How would a historian even measure that? So they don't anymore writing in 1935 and I love him, but it was written in 1935 historian will, Duran tries to tie, you know, the downfall of the media to their moral degeneration. And the fact that they were sort of nouveau riche, he writes, quote, their degeneration was even more rapid than their rise. Osteology who succeeded his father. See accessories proved again, that monarchy is a gamble in who's royal succession, great wits and madness, or nearly allied. He inherited a kingdom with equanimity and settled down to enjoy it. Under his example, the nation for God. It's Stern, morals and stoic ways wealth had come to suddenly to be wisely used.

Speaker 5:          01:59:00       The upper classes became the slaves of fashion and luxury. The men wore embroidered trousers. The women covered themselves with cosmetics and jewelry. The very horses were often comparison to in gold. These once simple and pastoral people who had been glad to be carried in rude wagons with wheels cut roughly out of the trunks of trees now road and expensive chariots from feast to Feast and quote. The truth is though, that what Doran rights there in 1935 isn't a whole lot different from what the ancient Greeks saw. The ancient Greeks sorta saw themselves as Marlboro men compared to these people from the east that were at best sort of Metro sexuals. The Greeks likes to point out the use of makeup as part of their idea that these easterners were a feminist writing hundreds of years later. By the way, xenophon talks about osteology is the last king of the medes and his guidelines, I guess you would call it today, his stencilled eyes, the rouge on his face, and xenophon who would have no way of knowing, says a wig have fake hair.

Speaker 5:          02:00:06       Now, here's the thing though, in the east, these kinds of things were cultural norms. It wasn't a sign of a feminist. The Pharaohs and the Egyptians had been using the dark coal around the eyes forever. Just a different cultural thing, but the Greeks saw it as just another sign of these oriental. If Feminine, Opulent Week, Clever, sneaky, you know, fill in the blank. Easterners, I will leave it to the credible historians to decide some day whether there's any truth to this motif about the medes sort of slouching towards Gomorrah or what have you. Most of the modern stuff I read today looks at that as a as a terribly old fashioned way to view the situation, but as I said, how do you quantify something like that anyway, but if you follow that narrative the way a guy like Hurghada test is taking it or a guy like will durant writing in 1935 is taking it.

Speaker 5:          02:01:02       There's an almost opportunity created by the decadence of the medes and the cruelty of their ruler. Right, and that can be exploited by somebody who has the opposite values from the people that are busy, slouching towards Gomorrah. In other words, people that were less corrupted by luxury, who were not as decadent, who were more, shall we say, possessors of the old time virtues, if you will, and this gets us back to a secondary value that a guy like Herat at this has for us. Remember, like I said, he's like the color era, the first real screenwriter, writer show runner, and and you learn two things from a guy writing the way he writes in the way. A lot of after him, right? One, you learn about these events. He's trying to relate to you, which may or may not be true and are probably a combination of the two. Right? We learned about, you know, the rise of Cyrus, at least the story that this guy heard, but at the same time you're having like a Vulcan Mind Meld with a 2,500 year old basically alien mind, a one way conversation with a 2,500 year old guy

Speaker 5:          02:02:08       and when you read Hurghada, just this, you know, I, I really wish I could speak the ancient Greek and read it and understand the little nuances so I could really hear this guy in his own words as he meant every specific word. But you getting a chance to see, you know, what this guy from a completely different time period likes and dislikes his worldview. What he thinks is good and what he thinks is bad. You know, his view sort of on the supernatural and the gods, his biases and his prejudices. You're learning about he and his world. When you read his stuff, part of what you have to filter it so carefully because just like all of us, his world pollutes his worldview so that you know, we don't get as nonbiased a view now as we might want, but what Hurghada tests does in this story is kind of say that because [inaudible] was the way he was a cyrus arises on the scene.

Speaker 5:          02:03:10       Modern Day historians can't decide or argue over whether or not there was some war fought between the medes and the Persians. Remember, these are for the most part, semi tribal peoples probably at this time. They used to think they were more like states. Now, no one's sure. Maybe a combination of some cities with some pastoral people that were lied to it. It's an interesting sort of hybrid and there might've been a lot of these kinds of societies around back then when they're transitioning from, you know, an old tribal world to something more along the lines of a centralized bureaucratic state. When you're in sort of a tweener zone, if you will. So either a war between these medes and the Persians or the tribes that they controlled, or sort of like, as one historian described it, the Medean empire getting a change in management

Speaker 5:          02:04:00       with maybe some Medea nobles helping to rebel against this osteology person and modern historians have some interesting, understandable sort of common sense reasons why they might want to. The theory is that this osteology guy is trying to convert the leads into more of a typical centralized Mesopotamian government. Where the king is is more autocratic. It has a lot more authority. It sounds like maybe he has to share a lot of authority with these different tribal rulers and as you might imagine, it's almost like a law of nature. They're unlikely to like that. This may have some modern historians think to sort of an uprising and internal coup, if you will. And this Cyrus, the second guy might be the person who gets to lead this now as the greatest early screen writer, Hirata tess has his own view of sorta what turns the tables on this.

Speaker 5:          02:04:56       Now. It's one of these stories that, again, maybe tells us more about Hurghada and the audience he's trying to please, but he must've heard this story somewhere. This is a typical tale by the way of oriental cruelty, but he setting up something that actually seemed to happen in the story and trying to give you a reason why it happened without having any real way of knowing other than these people he's talking to. He tells one of the most horrific stories in his writings, but he tells it like Alfred Hitchcock or west craven or someone like that. We alluded to it earlier when we said in an earlier story, you know, those [inaudible], you know, killed a boy and served it to the and king and he didn't like that. Well, in this story, it's that same thing, but with an extra twist. I have several different versions of Heraclitus.

Speaker 5:          02:05:45       Um, but let me set this up. What happens in the story is it concerns this osteology guy, the son of succe accessories and nowhere near his father in terms of greatness and kind of a jerk. And that's the way he's portrayed. And he has a dream and that these dreams, you got to love ancient history because they're always so wild. Hurghada tests related by the way the dream has something to do with his daughter urinating over the whole world or something, as I said, got to love the ancient history. And he asked the Magic to interpret it and they say, I'm not very good. This daughter's gonna give birth to something or she's the seed of something that's maybe going to overthrow you. And so to play it safe, Hurghada says he marries her off to some Persian, um, you know, maybe a great Persian guy, but this is the muddy and empire and, and no son of a Persian is going to be ruling the midian empire.

Speaker 5:          02:06:37       So that's been taken care of. But then about a year later, Herat at this says he has another dream about his daughter who's about to give birth to her first child. And in this dream he sees, I think it's, it's like vines coming out of her womb and then encompassing the whole earth or something. Again, akin to that and the match. I come in and interpret that, and as you might imagine, it's not good and it scares osteology who thinks that she, his daughter is going to give birth to a person who takes his throne. So in a story that you see in other tales, in other words, it's a pretty common motif with different twists. Osteology calls in the general. A guy named Harper Gus, who seems to be a historical figure and tells harper guests to get rid of the baby. Now Harper Guess Herata says, doesn't want to get rid of the baby.

Speaker 5:          02:07:28       Just let me stop for a second. In this story, Heraclitus is lovingly telling this story. He knows what the colorful pieces are and he says he doesn't want to get rid of the baby, doesn't want to kill a baby. So he gives the job to a shepherd and gives the shepherd the baby and says, get rid of the baby, expose it, you know, out into the open and let it die, and the shepherd doesn't want to get rid of the baby and it just so happens his wife is pregnant and she gives birth. Adjust this time to a stillborn child. Doesn't this sound like a bunch of old grimms fairy tales at this point? So as you might imagine, they take the stillborn child rapid in the royal close, keep the live when they were supposed to kill and give the stillborn child back to heart, biggest to give to his boss, to king and stacy.

Speaker 5:          02:08:13       It was done fast forward 13 years later or something like that and a boy is brought before. This is the headwater two story osteology because he's been whipping boys higher on the social standing scale. Then he, after a bunch of questioning it is determined and again this is the wonderfulness of the ancient mind meld you're having with Hurghada. This that basically osteology can tell that this boy is a king. It's like in your DNA. You can tell the difference between blue bloods and non blue bloods by the way they handle situations and it's inbred. Besides that osteology notices that the kid looks like him and after all he is his grandfather. He calls in hospice. Then he calls in the shepherd. He does a little investigation, figures the whole story out and pretends he's not mad. Tells heart biggest. He's often felt, I'm paraphrasing here from paralysis, but, but tells harper because he's often felt bad about the whole thing afterwards.

Speaker 5:          02:09:09       So He's, he's secretly relieved that the whole thing went the way it did. Why don't you go home, tell your wife we're going to have a banquet to celebrate all this and you can come over and, and, and we'll, we'll highlight you at the banquet. Send your son over your 13 year old son so he can keep the new boy, you know, my grandson company and uh, you know, we'll have a party tonight and Heraclitus says that heartbeat has goes back home and he's relieved because he knows he could have gotten in big trouble and the wife is happy and they go to this banquet. And this is where Alfred Hitchcock, Hurghada test of helicopter takes the story over. And again, I keep telling myself, I don't think this is making this stuff up. Somebody told him this story. This is what somebody somewhere believed. Now listen to this and try to imagine a story like this from the Assyrians, the Babylonians or the ancient Mesopotamians.

Speaker 5:          02:10:00       They just didn't write this way. Hurghada is a story. Has the 13 year old son of heart biggest going to the palace as requested and then picks up the story and says, this is from my discipline core translation. By the way, quote, when Harper gets his son, arrived at the palace, last Dr, had him butchered, cut up into joints and cooked, roasting some boiling the rest and having the whole properly prepared for the table. Dinner Time came and the guests assembled with heart. Biggest among them dishes of mutton were placed in front of osteology is then if everyone else except purpose to purpose was served the flesh of his son. All of it except for the head, the hands and feet, which had been put separately on a platter, covered with a lid. When heartbreak is thought he had eaten as much as he wanted. I asked him if he enjoyed his dinner.

Speaker 5:          02:10:52       He answered that he had enjoyed it very much indeed. Where upon those whose business it was to do so brought in the boy's head, hands and feet in the covered dish, stood by heart, biggest his chair, and told him to lift the lid and take what he fancied. Heart biggest, remove the cover and saw the fragments of his son's body as he kept control of himself and did not lose his head. If the dreadful cite us dog has asked him if he knew what animal it was, whose flesh he had just eaten. I know my Lord was her biggest this reply and from my part may the kings will be done. He said no other word, but took up what remained of the flesh and went home intending I suppose to bury all of it together. And that was how Harper Gus was punished and quote. If that had been in the Syrian record, it would have said something like his son. I divided the pieces I fed to him. I mean, it would be a straightforward sort of thing. You wouldn't have anybody setting up the suspense of, you know, having him eat and not know what it is. And then having the platter brought in, having the king asked the question, do you know what you ate? Did you like it? And then the platters lifted up. I mean those moments where you set up the tension and the drama, it's a movie. You could do that movie and change nothing.

Speaker 5:          02:12:10       It's living color. What's more, Heraclitus is clearly setting up these moments for his audience to do the equivalent of what we would do in a movie theater when some great seen on the screen happens that we're all really glad to see and you clap or something. He's got these moments because when you make osteology out to be such a jerk, when he gets what's coming to him in the story, it's a crowd pleaser. And then this story, of course he does. And while it's tempting to think that the entire thing is just a great tale, somebody great tale, maybe not initially, there are definite facts mixed in and you can see her test. Trying to explain the reasons behind the facts. Today may be a screenwriter would call it dramatic license because Babylonian records indicate that there was a general who corresponds to this heart biggest guy and that that general was involved in a battlefield.

Speaker 5:          02:13:07       Betrayal, maybe you could say in a key battle, osteology has had a large part of his army, desert him on the battlefield and go to the other side. It very well may have been this heart biggest person who led them to do that and Hurghada test wants you to think that see, he was a jerk and now this is what he gets, and and who would think that you could trust a man whose son you had served to him for dinner with the entire army in the first place, but nonetheless, the moment when Harper guests and the medes crossover to cyrus aside of the battlefield, must've been a crowd pleasing and satisfying moment for the audience, right? That jerk got what he deserved. In the Babylonian records, it's much more stark, as you might imagine, one of the texts from Babylon as quoted by peer Briana reads, quote, osteology is mobilized his army and he marched against Cyrus King.

Speaker 5:          02:14:07       Avant Sean, to conquer the army, rebelled against osteology and he was taken prisoner. They handed him over to Cyrus Cyrus march towards Batna, the royal city and quote by 5:50 bce or thereabouts, Cyrus and the Persians were basically in control of the old Isla might territories and now had inherited control of the Medea and empire, which was already one of the great empires in this particular world stage. It's kind of possible that the Lydian King, for example, that in three years Cyrus will be at war with, doesn't even really have a key idea who the Persians are. I'm not sure, but I mean judging from the sources, this is quite the turnaround. And as I said in 5:47, cyrus and the new Persian empire is fighting those same people. The means were fighting when that eclipse, you know, caused everyone to think that maybe they shouldn't be fighting, and it's a great story because the guy who runs the lydian empire now at this time is a guy named creases.

Speaker 5:          02:15:18       And there's a saying about him. You may have heard rich as creases, and that's the stereotype of the Lydians. At this time, uh, as I said, they're known as people who invented metal coinage, don't know if that's really true or not, but that's their reputation and it's attached to them because they're thought to be extremely wealthy and creases is supposed to have gone to one of the famous Oracle's maybe the most famous oracle in the entire Greek world, the Oracle at Delphi, which he may have been giving money to influence. There was a whole big problem during this period where some questioned the reliability of these oracles. Can you imagine a because of them taking money to keep operating from people. Increases was a bridge and he gave money to everybody's a little Donald Trump ish. Maybe you might say. And, um, asked the oracle, you know, now what would happen if I went to war with the Persian empire?

Speaker 5:          02:16:14       Now, little sidetrack here, maybe only worthwhile for the bedding people amongst you, but if you went to an advisor in Las Vegas who gave you advice and you said, will the Green Bay packers win the superbowl? And the answer was, if the Green Bay packers play in the superbowl, they will add to a great legacy. Do you bet? Creases was told by the Oracle at Delphi that have creases attacks the Persians, he will destroy a great empire. You could take that a number of different ways, couldn't you? You could say, hey, the greenbay packers are going to win. Or You could say, listen to the Dallas cowboys beat the Green Bay packers. They have added to a great championship legacy too. It's just the Dallas cowboys championship legacy. When creases and the lydians fight, Cyrus and the Persians, he loses. He destroys a great empire. The one that invented metal coinage. I would love to get into the kind of army that Cyrus had and what he used to accomplish this victory over the Lydians. But no, the acumen and military system is not well understood anyway. And it was only in the 19 eighties that they started putting together realistic reconstructions of the army in the days that are much better known than this period. I mean during the Greek inversion wars or after against Alexander in this period. It's all conjecture what the heck cyrus was using. I mean, you can say, well, he probably use this and it's logical to assume that, but nobody knows.

Speaker 5:          02:17:52       When you read Herodotus, he's always got some little stratagem in play that keeps you from having to know in a really what the army was doing in one of these big battles against creases. You know, the Persians were told we'll take their baggage camels and take the baggage off of them and put them in front of the army so that when the Lydian horses who've never seen camels right up to the front, they'll be scared off by the camels. I mean, you know, you get a victory in the battle just with that doesn't really help you know much about an army that must've been really, really good to do all these things cyrus was doing with it.

Speaker 5:          02:18:24       He does look like a very bold commander from the sources. I mean, one of the things he brought it just talks about is this, shall we call it a misunderstanding between creases and Cyrus after this big battle that starts off the campaign and it's bloody and inconclusive and winter's coming, so creases does with any ancient commander would have done during that period. He went home, went to the capital at stardust, this giant fortified city and dismissed mercenaries and let most of the army go home and told his allies, you know, in four months, show up here and we'll deal with this emerging Persian threat. His allies, by the way, included, you know, the great powers, Babylonia and Egypt. So maybe cyrus was starting to be seen as the destabilizing force in that little geopolitical ecosystem in that part of the world. Nonetheless, Cyrus didn't disband the army.

Speaker 5:          02:19:15       He didn't go home for winter. He were told, pursued the Lydians right on their heels. This is bald strategy, and he forced another battle and were told it was after creases had already basically sent most of the people, the Persians, but not paddling. That's the camel battle. And then they faced this monstrous fortification at Sardis. The capital of Libya that could easily hold out until all those allies show up in four months, you would think we're told it holds out for like 14 days, and again, we have another story about a a back path to the citadel being found by a Persian who spies one of the guards. Hats falling off, helmets falling off in the guard, retrieving it down some path. Again, you wouldn't know about what amazing siege engines maybe cyrus had because we always have some little story that accounts for how one of the great fortified cities in this part of the world gets taken in 14 days.

Speaker 5:          02:20:09       Nonetheless. We also get some accounts now of of of something we've spoken about, about how the Persians may be like darth vader to the Greeks, but they have something and and you know, you don't know if you want to call this propaganda or a sincere and clever and common sense and realistic approach to things. If you could sort of take either way, but shall we call it the tolerance bomb. We're told Theodora stimulus, especially mentions that cyrus gave a deal to the lydians before this whole thing started. He said, listen, submit to me and I'll leave you in charge of this whole area. It's basically the same deal. Xerxes offered the spartans. If they're awfully, come on, let's make a deal. Put down those weapons and not only will you get to go home, I'll put you in charge of all these people. You'll benefit, submit and profit.

Speaker 5:          02:21:00       Maybe you could call this combination of sort of machiavellian thinking with a sort of Gandhi like ethic that's going too far, but I love the connection. A realistic hardheaded knife in the back, sort of diplomacy with tolerance and mercy and leniency as your weapon. Get a knife, you with leniency and you know, you would have to suggest perhaps that there were two ways this lenient idea could go either not work at all and then you see why the Assyrians had to be as harsh as they were or because the Assyrians were as harsh as they were in the Babylonians who followed after them. The area was ripe for somebody who would offer. I mean, if everybody was going to be under somebody control, when did you want to go with the tolerant guy and remember we are grading on a curve here. When we talk about tolerance, the Persians could be every bit as atrocious as any other ancient people on occasion.

Speaker 5:          02:22:03       It just seemed like once they took over, there were a lot fewer of those occasions, maybe the historians or some of them that I grew up with would say something like, well, that's because the Assyrians already broke. All the troubles in people to the yoke of Empire seems a bit far fetched. Certainly you can say though that the whole sort of mood and attitude was altered and you don't get any more of those really intimidating reliefs showing things like, you know, heads of your enemies staring up at you or horrible violence or the flying of live captives and you don't get the writings where there's a boasting and a propaganda value where you're saying, this is what will happen to you if you rebel against us. Recess are gummy quotes. The SOM cylinder, it's called and it's Osher, Bonnie Paul, the last great king of Assyria, boasting of what he did to Babylon after his brother, who he put on the throne of Babylon, rebelled against him in 6:49 bce. First, he's besieged the people until they were cannibalistic and then picks up the narrative saying, quote,

Speaker 5:          02:23:11       out of hunger, the flesh have their sons and daughters they ate. Afterwards, I ripped out the tongue of those officers whose mouth said, blast themed against Asher, my master, and then slaughtered them. Any soldiers found still alive, were flogged in front of the wing. Good bowls built by Senaca. Rip My grandfather. I whipped the Naca ribs tomb and then tossed. They're quivering flesh for the jackals, the birds, and the fish to eat. In this way, I placated the wrath of the gods who would become incensed by their ignominy, his deeds, and then start gummy picks up the narrative saying, quote, this grizzly passage related to events that transpired in Babylon proceeds a brief description of the restorative work that Osher, Bonnie, Paul undertook in that city that the Assyrian king was unabashed about intertwining the account of his brutality with that of his clemency indicates that Mesopotamian royalty did not frowned upon the infliction of vicious reprisals against conquered populations. This attitude enabled the Assyrian and Babylonian kings to base their policies largely on terror. During the two centuries proceeding Cyrus's rise to power, the Assyrians and Babylonians had sacked nearly every major near eastern capital and their preferred practices of population, deportation and kidnapping. Sacred Images had deeply traumatized the people of the ancient near east end quote. In other words, if you had ever wanted to find a winning military strategy, this might be the time where mercy tolerance and being the cool conquerors really worked in your favor.

Speaker 5:          02:24:53       Cyrus is the one who initiated this idea that we're not going to impale everybody and we're not going to fly them and we're not going to force them to convert to our religion. You join us, pay your taxes. I may have some representatives in a garrison in your city, but life will be good. This Persian deal was very seductive.

Speaker 5:          02:25:17       Now here's where the story begins to dove tail with what we've already talked about earlier. The peoples that we spoke about, these Greeks who were in Anatolia, some of them spoke a language that was called Ionian, so they're often called Ionians, but there were other types of Greeks there to Asiatic Greeks is a term that's sometimes used. These people had been paying tribute to creases and the Lydians and Cyrus had gone to them before the war with creases in the Lydians and said, listen, how about you revolt against creases? And they said no, and some of them fought on creases aside. So after Cyrus winds, all the people in the region are coming to him to kind of say, Hey, boss, I always wanted you to win. I'm glad. I'm glad you're victorious. And Dha in the case of these Greeks, they went to him and said, can we have the same deal we had with the lydians and cyrus gets mad at them. We're told. He basically says, you could've had that deal if you join me and didn't fight against me. Now you want a special deal over all the other people in this region who didn't fight against me

Speaker 5:          02:26:20       and got mad. And those Greeks went back home, had a big meeting amongst each other, started rebuilding the walls of their cities, which they had knocked down and you know, as part of their deal with creases, um, and put the word out for help. And they sent word to the spartans. Now the spartans had also promised help decrease this when he was in trouble. Supposedly they were just getting in the boats, getting ready to go help. When in 14 days the Lydian capital falls didn't give him enough time to get there. Now they get, you know, in a very short period of time, a second call for help. And this time from Greeks,

Speaker 5:          02:26:59       it's about the Persians, just like that last call, these Persians must be a troublesome people. The spartans were a little busy when the message came, but they sent an emissary to talk to this Persian. Now every historian I'm reading is assuming that these Persians and these spartans do not know each other, that this may be the first time they ever encounter one another. It seems illogical considering all the trading and whatnot going on, but let's understand best case scenario, it's unusual and these people don't really know each other, and a spartan diplomat shows up in front of Cyrus, we're told, and we have one of these wonderful periods. We can imagine our Clint Eastwood type figures showing up in front of this king on the rise. Again, I try to imagine in Alexander the great light like figure on the rise must've been a pretty good looking guy because we're told that the Persians standards of beauty were modeled on him ever afterwards.

Speaker 5:          02:28:03       This is the way Hurghada tests from my purpose translation, describes the diplomat talking to the king of the Persians, who conquered lydia and who's just about to put the hammer down on the Greeks of Asia. Herata says quote, and when they arrived at Ikea, they sent the most distinguished man with them, name latrines to Sardis to declare to Cyrus in the name of the lack of Simonian's that he must not inflict reckless damage on any of the Greek territory since the lack of Simonian's would not tolerate it. Remember, liking ammonium is another name for spartans. Now, this people that Cyrus has never heard of is just told him not to mess with any of these people. He just conquered and he basically turns to the Greek advisor next to him and says, who are these people and how many of them are there? Hirata to says quote.

Speaker 5:          02:28:57       They say that when the Herald had delivered this message, cyrus question, the Greeks who were with him asking them who were these lack of pneumonia, who would send such a command to him and how many of them were there when he heard their response? Hirata says, he said to the Spartan Harold quote, I have never yet feared any men who have a place in the center of the city set aside for meeting together, swearing false oaths and cheating one another, and if I live long enough, lack of Simonian's will have troubles of their own about which to converse rather than those of the Ionians. Hurghada test then says, quote Cyrus, thus insulted the Greeks because of their custom of setting up a Gorillaz, which are marketplaces in their cities for the purpose of buying and selling, which is unknown among the Persians, who do not use markets and indeed have no such place as an a gore in any of their cities.

Speaker 5:          02:29:52       And to quote this is worth a little digression for a second. Just from an interest standpoint. First of all, Hurghada tests would have probably known what Persian cities were like. He himself was an Ionian Greek or lived in an Iranian Greek city. He would have known this and that's fascinating when you consider that you think of the Middle East now and you think of the bazaars and the marketplaces and all that, but the Persians had this really interesting cultural carrot and stick thing going themselves. You know, we've talked about the human laboratory experiment a few times in this program, like the spartans for example. The Persians had a different one going and it's fascinating to me. Everything you read about them says that, you know, of the top three things that, that society places import on. One of them is the truth. And the funny thing is, is in our world today, we think, oh yeah, sure, everybody should tell the truth, but what if you made this like a commandment that people took ultra seriously? We told you earlier that when the Spartan told xerxes about the Persians, he said, if I'm lying, you know, treat me like a liar. And I told you that that's a death penalty. The Persians took lying really seriously. We're told that the education of Persian male youth was to learn to ride, to learn, to shoot the bow, and to learn, not to lie, to tell the truth. Isn't it fascinating to imagine a society where this was both a state and legal requirement perhaps, and certainly

Speaker 5:          02:31:20       a heavily, you know, encouraged and incentivized cultural norm. Thou shalt not lie. It almost becomes like the plot to one of those movies, you know, where the main character drink some potion and all of a sudden, you know, is forced to tell the truth all the time. What if you had a society like that? What what Cyrus is saying to the spartans is, I can't respect any people who have these places in their cities set up where people can specifically go to lie to one another,

Speaker 5:          02:31:48       and by the way, without going too deeply into it, there's a lot of connection to Persian religious beliefs during this time period. And how that plays into the question of lying. The Persians were worshipers of who were a Mazda was a God's name and the old needs used to worship a god named Mithra. And there's connections between good and evil that some religious experts tied to Christianity and ancient Judaism. And, and who the heck knows? All you know is that it's not just a cultural and legal question, it's a religious one. Two, it's interesting to speculate how much people still lied in a society with that many things favoring the truth. It's interesting to think about now they're human laboratory experiment, if you will, the truthful society. And how realistic is that? Nonetheless, we have now set the stage for problems between the Greeks and the Persians. From this point on, if you want to call it a clash of civilizations, you who have marketplaces in lie and we who don't. It's about to happen. Lucky for the spartans. They'll get to stay out of it for awhile because Cyrus isn't done conquering yet. Not by a long shot.

Speaker 5:          02:32:58       Historians still discuss whether or not cyrus should be seen as an intentional, you know, a conscious conquer river. Allah Alexander the great or Napoleon. You know, somebody who's sat down and said, I'm going to recreate the old Assyrian Empire or somebody that got involved in a bunch of conflicts each for their own reason and you know, when you, when you take over their territory in and kind of tripped into empire. I mean, obviously that's a little simplistic, but um, I think it's indicative of how in, in certain really key motivational areas, this guy is still a bit of a mystery.

Speaker 5:          02:33:35       He will disappear behind the veil of our historical site, I guess you could say for several years after his. I'm taking over of Lydia, he will leave a general who may be this historical heart biggest guy and an army behind in western Turkey, what's now modern day western Turkey to reduce these Asiatic Greek cities. And he will go. It's assumed to the eastern part of his realm and the northern part of his realm and conquer further and also shore up his defenses against the many powerful tribes that sort of ring his territory. Probably a combination of fighting. Some of them showing the flag to some of them are intermarrying and making diplomatic agreements with some of them accepting vassalage from others. I mean it was years of work. So this guy is doing the Yeoman's work, the hard slogging of creating a stable state and that requires years of constant effort and he disappears from the historical record while he's doing this.

Speaker 5:          02:34:41       And then in 5:39 bce, he reappears again at the head of an army heading toward Babylon. Now what Cyrus is going to do to Babylon is probably his crowning achievement in his career and I have to remind myself that his career is already incredible. This is a guy who by 5:39 bce has been a king for about 20 years and in 20 years he's taken this people from a virtual, you know, backwater Nowheresville to a point where they've conquered half of the great nation states in their little ecosystem that exists, you know, after the fall of Assyria. And he's outside the gates of number three of four with an army. That's pretty awesome right there for a king of an Sean who will very soon be referring to himself as part of his official royal titles as the King of the universe. When you go from an Sean to King of the universe, that's quite a jump and he's kind of a self made conqueror.

Speaker 5:          02:35:41       You compare him to someone like Alexander the great who is of course awesome, but Alexander reminds you of sort of a historical rich kid who inherits his father's already thriving corporation with tons of ready cash and does great things with it. No offense to Alexander, it's awesome, but Cyrus never had any of those advantages and look where he is only 20 years into his reign. Now let me just voice my own opinion that that what Cyrus is about to do to Babylon is strange. You can't tell what the sources, what's really going on and the different histories have different approaches to it and it's been argued about and and the views have changed and updated over time. There's just not enough hard sources though for anyone to really know for anyone to conclusively when I'm certainly not going to take a position on it, but I am going to explain sort of the weirdness of it.

Speaker 5:          02:36:31       The first thing you have to ask is whether or not cyrus arriving outside Babylon when he did was a coincidence because the timing is awesome if you're hoping to take over Babylon. Is that just because he gets lucky or is that just because of the Babylonian propaganda would say later the hand of Marduk had seized him and brought him to Babylon to get rid of the horrible king of Babylon and restore things. Just lucky or did Cyrus and the Persians have advanced information that things suck in Babylon right now? You come now and half the population will be ready to welcome me with open arms. Was that may be part of the reason he showed up when he did or as some have argued for years. Could you make a case that the reason that people were so disaffected

Speaker 2:          02:37:16       in Babylon was in part due to Persian propaganda that undermined it? No, the entire wheel to resist and I have to be honest, I did not understand that part of the story for years growing up, but something has changed in the way historian's view it, so now makes more sense to me. When I was growing up, the attitude was that in 5:39 BC, this was when Cyrus arrived. So something happens and occurs in Babylon falls and Cyrus takes it over and there you go. So this idea that he had this propaganda undermining Babylon made you think about when, when was that going to happen? I mean just everything happened so quickly. The modern way of viewing this amongst a lot of historians is that may be the Persians in the Babylonians had been fighting battles for a couple of years and that in 5:39 when Cyrus in his army show up outside of Babylon, that's like the end of the Second World War when the Russians show up outside of Berlin and you're having your last climactic battle, you know, in a multi battle long war.

Speaker 2:          02:38:12       Again, the sources are just not there to confirm any of this, you know, categorically. But it would make a heck of a lot more sense if you were saying that Cyrus and the Persians were undermining the Babylonians with propaganda. If you had years to do it right now, understanding what Cyrus might've been doing requires talking about Babylon itself a little bit like the Assyrian city of Nineveh. This is a great urban center and it's large enough and complex enough so that you see a lot of the same sorts of dynamics going on. You know, I'll be it through an ancient lens that you would see in any modern large city today. There are fissures, there are divisions, there are tensions, there are disagreements there. There are all sorts of things that if someone wanted to come in, they could widen the disagreements and it's slowly but surely increase the level of anger and discontent.

Speaker 2:          02:39:06       There's a number of things to be exploited. To start with the fact that the king is unpopular. The king of Babylon during this time period almost certainly suffers from from bad, bad historical publicity. His name is nab Unitus, and by the time all of this is going down, nab and I. This is about 70, 70 years old in a world, you know, with the lifespan is so much shorter. How many 70 year old people are there? He's like a wizard, you know, to the population in terms of this is a guy whose memory goes back to events. Most people can't get anywhere near memory wise. He may have been the general who helped seal the deal between those two sides at the battle of the eclipse. Remember when they suck each other's blood as part of a, you know, sealing the deal. This, this, this nab unitus guy when he was much younger and more vigorous may have been one of the generals on site. Now he's old and it's really hard to get your mind around what this guy was really like. He sort of portrayed as a, as a kind of a doting antiquarian

Speaker 5:          02:40:15       by some historians. Some people consider him the first official archeologist. I think that's got to be crazy because because there were lots of earlier kings who were into digging up, you know, earlier versions of their civilization. But this guy is portrayed as somebody who almost prefers it to being a king. He'd rather be out there, Indiana Jonesing, some old Babylonian stuff from the previous kings and then dealing with the day to day government.

Speaker 5:          02:40:40       He also looks like a guy who doesn't mind getting out of Babylon. I have this image for the movie of some I want to use like the guy who played the the scientists, the doctor, and back to the future and have him be nab rhinitis and just have him sort of did finding the hustle and bustle of Babylon too much in those young kids and they're loud music and all that stuff. So he and the priesthood of Babylon, especially the main important God Marduk begin to have these disagreements. Now understand something in the world before modern times. There is really only one reliable counterbalance to the power of a king or an emperor pharaoh.

Speaker 5:          02:41:21       And that's the priesthood and the religion because the power that that they have stems from the same source, right? You're, you're king by divine, right? It's the gods who want you to be a king, but who has a special relationship with the gods and who helps placate the gods and who does the work of the Gods and who knows what the God really wants while the priesthood and the religion. Right? So the only other source of legitimate power in these societies before modern times are often, you know the priest and the priest and Martech don't like this nab. Tonight is guy, and part of the reason why is he seems to be kind of will favoring another God over. There's. This is what I mean by it's hard to get your mind around Nabonidus because he may be like an [inaudible] type character. You know the Egyptian Pharaoh that may have been a monotheist and may have tried to change Egypt's religion.

Speaker 5:          02:42:10       Another similar story, right? Where you have the autocratic ruler opposed by a powerful priesthood and after Aka not died, things returned back to normal and they kind of were carving his face off of all of the old things. Trying to forget he ever lived. Now, urbanite is may have been one of these guys to the one of the change, the religion. His mother was supposedly a priestess of a religion devoted to a god named sin, a Moon God, and so nab tonight is right before this time period, gives the ultimate middle finger to the priesthood of Marduk by leaving Babylon and going to some Arabian oasis.

Speaker 5:          02:42:47       Now, historians in modern times if found all sorts of really good logical patriotic reasons why the king might do that. In past times it was much more portrayed like this guy is a mystic, either a mystic or an old man or a combination of the two and he just wants to get away from is unworthy people and he appreciates it more in these Arabian oasis. It's probably what modern historians think. He's probably, they're doing important work for the country, but he's missing important work. At the same time, the Babylonians required their king to be there once a year for a New Year's festival. It was important he had to physically grasp the hand of the God in front of the population once a year to ensure success and good things and all these kinds of deals and he stayed away for like a decade on the Babylonian records will say every year the king was not here for the ceremony or what have you, and they're getting pissed that he's putting more money into creating more of these temples for the other religion, denying some money that the people of Marduk expect and and you can just see it boiling over.

Speaker 5:          02:43:48       Right. And then the kings not even there. His son Belshazzar is ruling as a region and he's not popular either, so the king is part of it, but Babylon is going through tough economic times two and that's putting the squeeze on people. They're having problems with disease and that's causing unrest. Archeologists, Dr Joan oats describes, you know the down and dirty parts of, of, of day to day suffering and let's remember something. Babylon's banking system and financial system was developed enough so that they had great banking houses there that were very powerful and lived on long after this period and the end, and that's just another one of those dynamics that makes us think about modern times. These are powerful interests that have some authority in the state. What happens when things seemed to be falling apart and people are losing money and times are bad and and you start getting Persian propaganda about this king who sounds like things are going his way, which remember during this time period might have caused a lot of people to figure the gods are smiling on that guy and our kings not even showing up to shake the God's hand every New Year's.

Speaker 5:          02:44:53       Right. Here's the way Dr Joan oats describes the situation in Babylon considering also remember that this king looks like a guy who's trying to change religious traditions, trying to change a bunch of other things, and Dr. oates writes, quote clearly Nabil [inaudible] is religious and administrative reforms provoked great resentment. While the wars and extensive building programs of his predecessors had proved a severe burden on the country's resources, large numbers of economic texts reveal severe inflation. A situation now made worse by the spread of plague between five slash 60 bce and 5:50 bce, prices rose by up to 50 percent and from five 62, four 85 bce, the total increase amount of some 200 percent and not just that, but again, take this with a grain of salt. It's argued about but, but there are people inside Babylon who might be considered, shall we say, vulnerable to propaganda that created descent. There are a lot of people in Babylon who are there because they were forcibly taken once upon a time from where they came from and some of the propaganda afterwards. Certainly the post, but maybe some

Speaker 2:          02:46:09       of the pre propaganda to from Cyrus told these people that if the Persians were to take over, they get to go home. Start with the deportees from Judah. Jewish people today. There are, there are still, I'm sure still, you know, even with all the troubles Jews in that part of the world today that are descendants of people who were forcibly removed after the Babylonians sacked Jerusalem. What if Cyrus was telling those people, if I get a fight, could empower you, can go home, and what if he was telling all the other deportees the same thing. Now in historians refer to Cyrus and the Persians propaganda. The first idea that comes to mind is like negative propaganda, like the Nazi stuff designed to lie to people and get you to believe things that aren't true, but you could make a case that that since we know that Cyrus and the Persians will eventually actually do what they're saying here, right?

Speaker 2:          02:47:06       That they will, for example, allow the Jews to go back to Judah and reestablish their religion and even eventually pay for some of the rebuilding of the second temple. What will be the second temple with, with royal funds, when you know that they're actually going to do that? Maybe you could say that this propaganda is a lot more like dropping leaflets over enemy military lines that say something like, you know, surrendered to us. We don't hurt prisoners and we'll give you a hot meal and you know, a few bucks in your pocket and some cigarettes. What would they have done in the old days? Maybe this is like telling the people inside Babylon do not fear. I may be coming, but I'm going to send you home now. Real experts on this Ip embryonic caution us against thinking about this the way that I just described to you that this is a a conscious policy of toleration.

Speaker 2:          02:47:57       He says, the way the marketing really is is a lot more like cyrus's, Assyrian and Babylonian predecessors where he's essentially promising continuity and because continuity means allowing these people to do things the way that they're accustomed to do it, it seems like tolerance and he points out that it's normal for conquerors in this region even before this time period to come in and promise to restore everything that's wrong. The gods are upset. I will fix that. The economy is bad. I will fix that. You are kept away from your home and your gods are just, you know, I will fix that, the restore and recreate her of order. So whatever you want to call this. In 5:39, cyrus and the Babylonian army meet and in a battle where there seems to have been a really nasty massacre. At the end, the Babylonian army was defeated the rest of the troops that are run back to the very formidable defenses of the city and within two days, somehow the gates of the city are opened and Cyrus's general is marching through the streets and triumph in Babylon

Speaker 5:          02:49:08       falls. And now tonight is fleas and he's eventually captured and supposedly treated well by Cyrus. Just like all the other kings were Hurghada. This of course has to give us a stratagem story of how it happened this time. It involves, you know, waiting till they can get the river down, the flows through the city to a certain length or to a point where the troops can go through the marshes or what have you and capture the city. And I think he's one of the ones that say that the city didn't even know it was being captured because there was some, you know, revelry going on attached to a religious cult and the city so big anyway mean modern excavations put the city size is over 2000 acres and the wall circumference at about 11 miles. So it's possible that in one part of the city where they were partying it up and the Persians got in, the natural thing to do would be to throw out a story like that and blame it on typical, you know, Greek stereotypes and whatnot.

Speaker 5:          02:50:03       But it should be pointed out one that oftentimes in these ancient religions there was an awful lot of decadent or fun or depends on your point of view, I guess stuff that was part of the religious rights. And you'll see this in Greece and Rome and a ton of other religions the world over, especially in the ancient period. And these people are immensely religious. The Babylonians especially, it's a holy city of Mesopotamia, right? These are very religious people. So imagine people with the commitment of like a Taliban, right? The seriousness with which they take this in stride and militancy and all that, but you might be commanded to party. It's a party for God and if you're not there, the ramifications could be huge. Right? I'm inclined to think that it's a Greek stereotype of course, but there's a part of me that wants to believe it's the latter.

Speaker 5:          02:50:51       Now, the one thing, this conquest, if that's even the right word of Babylon is known for is the fact that it's generally considered to be bloodless and forget that battle we talked about with the nasty potential massacre at the end when the city of Babylon is taken, it's taken essentially voluntarily. I mean it's like the Babylonians open up the door and Cyrus says, general comes in and 17 or so days later, Cyrus himself comes in and we're told that the population, you know, gets in front of his chariot and lays down palm fronds and stuff, which some historians in the old days used to be sure was a sign of how much people wanted them. They're more modern day historian's. Point out that that's generally how you get treated when you come into a city that's trying to show that they're no threat at all and please don't hurt us.

Speaker 5:          02:51:37       That's perhaps what the Persian takeover of Babylon is most known for. Cyrus didn't hurt anybody, and as I said earlier, Naba is his life is spared, which supposedly is the same fate that Cyrus has made it out to all the kings he's faced, which by the way is not only unusual, but it's not even maybe true. Who knows? There are always little hints somewhere that maybe Cyrus killed these kings and the propaganda covered it up. Nonetheless, historically and traditionally, he supposed to have spared and given good lives to all these other kings. He defeated osteotomies of the medes creases of the Lydians. Now, now benign cysts of the Babylonians.

Speaker 5:          02:52:16       What is the message Cyrus is trying to send here? I mean, that's what I find interesting. You want to know a little bit about the guy himself and maybe what he was trying to do. What's the message when he does that? Because the Assyrian King, who last conquered Babylon brags about how he tied the king of Babylon up like a pig and display them in the center of Nineveh. So this is not standard operating procedure. It's one of the things, by the way, that fascinates me about Cyrus, because the outcomes razor approach to history, which is the right way to go. I mean, what else are you going to do is to assume the most logical things, right? You don't assume illogical things. So the assumption always is that someone like Cyrus is playing a hardcore cynical propaganda game. And again, odds are probably is most people would be, but occasionally you're going to get some different kind of human being because we see them, they exist. It's just if you're using the alchemist razor approach to try to determine, you know, what a gone Gandhi was really like a thousand years from now, you might be looking at listened. Gandhi was really, um, you know, this was a cynical attempt to figure out a way to gain power to level. I mean, you could figure out all these real logical reasons why a guy might do this.

Speaker 5:          02:53:26       Sometimes people who are doing things for mystic reasons or morality reasons or humanistic reasons or any of these things. Sometimes those people slipped through the cracks because it's just so easy to assume they had a more real world, terra firma reason for doing things. Is it possible that cyrus was kind of a humanist? Maybe you know, this is how he's portrayed by the way, by his real fans and a lot of people back in Iran. I mean as the guy who invented human rights sort of at least as a ruler is concerned. And Babylon is one of the number one pieces of evidence, you know, that gets trotted out in defense of this idea that this isn't just some sort of policy of tolerance for expediency sake. That this is how Cyrus really believes you can govern.

Speaker 5:          02:54:16       And it should be pointed out that that not only has babylon kind of surrender without a fight. There's another Babylonian city or two that kind of opens their doors to Cyrus. And it's interesting because, you know, resists Origami has an interesting take on something that the Babylonian King did as part of the, the, the fighting with Cyrus for Babylon supposedly, and this is a way to look at nab tonight, is showing that maybe he was this really responsible king after all, before Cyrus gets to Babylon nab night, it goes around to all the surrounding towns and, and takes their gods, takes all their little, the statues and the representations of their gods and takes them to Babylon. And traditionally this is considered to be an act of safekeeping, right? You know that you don't want your statue of Liberty falling into the hands of the elamites and ending up in their trophy case, right?

Speaker 5:          02:55:02       So you take all these village, God's back to Babylon for safekeeping reasons are gone. Me Though has an interesting take on this in his book, discovering Cyrus, he does a great job reminding us of the interesting, uh, belief systems of the people who have these gods. And then how maybe you could see what nab and knight is doing is the equivalent of perhaps kidnapping the gods of these towns. And holding them hostage for good behavior, right? Stay loyal to Babylon or your God gets it in the neck. Something like that. Here's what's our gummy rights, and remember, this only makes sense if nab tonight is a seriously worried that some of these towns are just going to go over to cyrus because of the propaganda or whatever he writes, quote, faced with the very real prospect that is, cities would open up their gates to the conqueror.

Speaker 5:          02:55:51       Nab Tonight is settled upon a drastic policy. He decided to hold hostage. The sacred idols of Babylonia is outlying cities to ensure the loyalty of their inhabitants. So when Cyrus in his army resumed their march in the late summer of 5:39 bce, a series of caravans laden with divine images and other religious artifacts made its way to Babylon. Living today, we can hardly grasp the full psychological impact of nab. Unitus is action. The idol was the centerpiece of the ancient Mesopotamian cult and the most important symbol of the community. The inanimate statues were treated like royalty, bathed, perfumed, groomed, and even fed lavish meals by an entourage of domestic servants. Priests and personal attendance, Ancient Mesopotamian cults were geographically centralized and the God's power's territorially limited. That is why Cyrus could not receive the divine approval he desired with the gods concentrated in Babylon. He then continues, but nab unitus was playing a dangerous game by emptying is cities have their idols.

Speaker 5:          02:56:56       Proximity to the cult statue meant everything to the superstitious masses who believed that the sacred images of their gods could perform miracles, cure illness, and most importantly, protect their settlements. Cities last divine protection when they're God's left and quote, one of the first things that Cyrus will brag about doing when he takes over Babylon is returning all those gods to the outlying communities, and those people freaking out at, you know, having their gods back. Once again, as Pierre, Brianna says, Cyrus's portraying himself as the restorer of order of things as they should be. He's beginning to tie himself to the ancient Assyrian tradition. Some historians suggest consciously, he'll talk about repairing something in the city and coming across some proclamation by Asha, Bonnie Paul, the Assyrian King. He'll tie himself to Assyria and this ancient in a royal tradition. When he starts calling himself king of kings and King of the universe, these are old,

Speaker 2:          02:58:02       a Syrian and even acadian terms, but if cyrus was starting to use these ancient titles for himself, you can see why he thought he might deserve it because 80 or 90 years after you know the ancient kingdom of Assyria fell, Cyrus had put Humpty dumpty back together again with sort of a different form and different marketing and different branding, but all of a sudden, once again, just as head existed during later a Syrian times, one power had had Gemini in that part of the world. Now trying to rule immensely different people. People from you know everything from from deeply urban environments and places like Babylon, to Phoenecian cities. Two tribes that existed off in the edges of the Eurasian Steppe and incorporate all these different people into one empire.

Speaker 2:          02:59:08       Much is made of the different strategies that the Persians used over the Assyrians. Instead of trying to shoo everybody into one, you know, cultural style, convert everybody to your religion. Make Good Assyrians, have these conquered people. The Persians used a much lighter touch that the idea of toleration really was to allow local customs to continue. The Assyrians wouldn't have tolerated that the fact that the Persians didn't try to change all that, whether it was a question of religion or language or anything else. In fact, when the Persian empire gets up and running, Persians will be put in all the most important positions, but Persian will not be the language of the empire. There will always be only a tiny minority of people actually speaking Persian. All of the official proclamations will be multilingual, so the different people can read them.

Speaker 2:          02:59:59       All the local gods are respected and supported. Now, again, is this some sort of, you know, humanitarian gesture on Cyrus's part or is it a guy who is a humanitarian and thanks. Listen, I'm just telling you this is the best way to treat people and it will work out best. In other words, a guy who believes his own humanitarian beliefs and morals dove tail into good outcomes, or is it somebody who cynically looked at this and just says, listen, I'm just telling you, if we do it this way, we'll have less revolts. It'll be much better than the way the Assyrians did it. Who knows? It's tempting to think of Cyrus as brilliant and visionary, regardless of which one of those things is true. He organizes this empire. He starts creating things that are called satraps in sat trapeze, which are administrative units that will be built upon by his successors, and then the next major thing we hear about Cyrus, it's almost like you know when these people live that far back, you get the highlights of their lives right? Highlight number one, you know conquest of Medea. Highlight number to conquest

Speaker 5:          03:01:00       of Lydia. How that number three conquest of Babylon highlight number for the expedition against a queen of one of the most powerful tribal coalitions in Central Asia.

Speaker 5:          03:01:16       Now the fact that there is a clean involved in this story should tip you off to the idea that it's going to be a good one, and Hurghada test by the way knows this. He's eager to get to this story and he's going to spend a ton of time on it. He's been setting it up. He knows his audience is ready. He's got a little moral twists that may or may not have anything to do with reality, but you get a look at that 2,500 year old mind that your mind melding with one way at this point in the story, but it becomes the time where Heraclitus is at his least reliable too. I mean, he jumps from highlight number three to highlight number four in Cyrus's life in one second. If you look at the actual dates involved though, you'll see that there is like nine years between highlight number three and highlight number four and nine years when Cyrus is well to use his own marketing and branding king of the universe. What the heck was this guy doing for nine years while he was putting out some propaganda? We know something called the Cyrus cylinder is a famous, and it's this piece where first cyrus has the Babylonian gods saying I was with him the whole way, and then he introduces himself as this good guy

Speaker 5:          03:02:25       again, propaganda and makes it easier to rule a subject. People, if you make it feel like it was your God that wanted me here

Speaker 5:          03:02:34       I came because he took my hand. Right, so so you're legitimizing your rule and tying you into the to the age old power structure and basically saying that king you defeated was the real weirdo that the god didn't want. I am restoring, you know, the kingship to the people that mark wants to have it. You can see that the same is true in a lot of the other religions that Cyrus is involved with. This is why a lot of people think his whole propaganda tolerance thing was much more of a political move because look at how it helps him politically in a way that by the way, he could not have foreseen it made them immortal.

Speaker 5:          03:03:10       This is from peer Brown's book from Cyrus to Alexander, but at the translation from the Bible that he uses in the same way that the cyrus cylinder says, the Babylonian God, Marduk took Cyrus's hand and swept away all the opposition. This is what the Israeli God, Yahweh did, according to the Bible quote that says y'all way to his appointed to Cyrus, whom he has taken by his right hand to subdue nations before him and stripped the loins of kings to force gateways before him that their gates be closed no more. I will go before you leveling the heights. I will shatter the bronze gateways, smash the iron bars. I will give you the hidden treasures, the secret hordes that you may know that I am your way.

Speaker 5:          03:03:55       And so once again, cyrus has these gods on his side. Why are they on this side? Well, he's always helping, isn't he? He's always doing what the priesthood of Marta would like. In general. It's interesting how Martin follows along. He likes if you treat as priests well in the case of y'all way. Well, according to the Bible again and Pierre Briana, skeptical of the details but says in, in, in the bigger picture, at least, it was consistent with what actually happened. The Bible says that in the reign of a king to kings, after two official kings after Cyrus, they found the actual order that would have made y'all way pleased with investing, shall we say in the Cyrus conquests, according to the Bible and Pierre brands description of it. This is from Ezra, by the way, out of the royal archives, a baton. Ah, the order said, quote, in the first year of Cyrus, the king, King Cyrus decreed temple of God in Jerusalem, the temple will be rebuilt as a place at which sacrifices are offered and by which offerings are brought to be burnt.

Speaker 5:          03:04:58       It's height as to be 60 cubits. It's width, 60 cubits. They're going to be three thicknesses of stone blocks and one of would the expenses to be met by the king's household. Furthermore, the vessels of gold and silver from the temple of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the sanctuary in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, are to be restored so that everything may be restored to the sanctuary in Jerusalem and put back in the temple of God and quote that dovetails nicely with that story of the ghostly hand, doesn't it? Because what that Guy Belshazzar was drinking out of that made you know you always so mad to begin with are all these sacred vessels from the old temple in Jerusalem, Solomon's Temple. Now Cyrus was decreeing that you rebuild Solomon's Temple and you pay for it out of the king's treasury and you bring back all these things that are still around and restock the temple with them, and then you send the people who have been deported here, back home.

Speaker 5:          03:06:00       Now here's the thing, this reconstituted area that will become a sad trap by the way, does not have its political freedom. They're not going to be the way they were. You know when the Babylonians and Egyptians were arguing over them, but you got to see that they're pretty darn far ahead. They went from a people that might have died out religiously. In fact, the book I had, the places Cyrus has one of the top, most 100 influential people of all time says that that's one of the things. Maybe you credit him with the fact that if he doesn't do this, there's a chance Judaism doesn't continue over the long haul. In this case, he builds what's known as the second temple, and if you want to see continuity, the wall that is still one of the holiest, if not the holiest sites, I guess the Temple Mount will be holy or but, but it's part of the temple. Mount is the famous Western Wall. The Western Wall is a Roman era addition to the

Speaker 2:          03:06:55       second temple, which cyrus allegedly according to the Bible, paid for and authorized. It's so interesting, isn't it? To consider how connected the stories of the ancient Iranians, the ancient Persians are to the ancient Jewish folks, especially considering the current antagonism between them. You know, as late as the 19 seventies, the shah of Iran was, was touting this ancient closeness between the peoples and their relationship. If not for the ancient Persians and Iranians, there's a chance there wouldn't be Judaism today and depending on when it died out, there's a very good chance you wouldn't have had the religions that sprouted off that branch. You wouldn't have had Christianity, you probably wouldn't have had Islam. In other words, is Cyrus the great actually did do this and he had never lived to do it. What would the world look like today? Another thing it says in that 100 most influential people of all time that I thought was interesting is that many of the people that get credited as being very important and dynamic and instrumental human beings in terms of their effect on history, did something that would have been done anyway might not have been done at that time or that way, but a lot of this stuff would have happened.

Speaker 2:          03:08:07       Someone else would have discovered the light bulb probably the author thought it likely that if cyrus the great had never lived, none of this stuff happens. He was a unique individual and even though you can't get your mind around the specifics of how he was a unique individual, you can sort of look at what built up even if he ever wants. Right, and you have to assume that there was a lot of foundation bubbling up up under the surface for Cyrus to work with. This is still a pretty incredible human being. I think you could probably say with a decent chance of being right that he is in the five thirty's bce, the greatest geo political figure who's ever lived, which makes the next thing I'm going to say no. So hard to believe. You know? Why should I say it? How about letting historian 80 olmsted in a book published in Nineteen Forty Eight?

Speaker 2:          03:09:00       Say it again. Is there any more of a telling example that these people live at the very tail end, the black and white era of recording of human history because how can this guy be as big as he is and yet this next line be true? Olmsted said, quote here, we must leave Cyrus for suddenly and without warning. Our information comes to an end and to quote 200 years after this period, we will know Alexander the Great's symptoms to such a degree that doctors today try to diagnose what he may have died of and they still don't know. I'm not saying everything's perfect, but you know where when the how's the why's, how can you not know how this guy dies? Highlight number four in his life as portrayed by Heraclitus is Hurghada tells a story of how

Speaker 5:          03:09:54       he dies and I love the fact that Hurghada does goes to the trouble to point out that he's heard several different versions of this story, but the one he's going to give you is the one he thinks is most likely and maybe it's just a coincidence that the story that Hurghada thinks is most likely is the one with the most exotic interesting movie like elements to it. You can imagine. I can't imagine he left a better version on the table somewhere saying, nope. You know, I just don't believe that because the one he used is so awesome. Now, is it believable? That's the problem here. Nobody knows what's believable off the top of my head, if you asked me what percentage bought into the general idea of Hirata story, I'd say it's like 80 percent. Most of them don't believe any of the details, but the broad idea that in 5:30 bce, cyrus the great died somewhere out in this step area as Hurghada to said details, probably unknown about 20 percent I'd say, of the historians, don't think he died a completely different way.

Speaker 5:          03:10:55       Something against different tribes than Hirata says in different areas. Others that he didn't die that way at all. Xenophon renting a couple centuries afterwards, we'll say died in bed peacefully. So there are some historians who buy that too. In Iran, it's a generally, I think a higher percentage of historians that think he didn't die the way Heraclitus says, and in part you, you can understand why you'd be a little skeptical. It's just too darn interesting the way he does it. You can see, you know, the admonition that I got when I was starting in journalism, the one that said, you know, tell what really happened in the most interesting way possible. What happens to an admonition like that? If there's no way you could possibly know what really happened, but you have to tell it anyway. What are your standards? Then? You're pretty much left with the most interesting way you can at that point, right?

Speaker 5:          03:11:44       The story is herodotus tells, it involves this little twist. You're going to end up leaving his theatrical presentation with a deeper message. Again, the deeper message may or may not be true Hurghada this couches this story now into the ID of overreach. Maybe the idea of absolute power corrupts absolutely, and before we write this off, as many historians do right away because it's just such an obvious moral message. Remember, you could make that case about Hitler. You know, with the absolute power turning you mad after awhile with Alexander, you can make that case. I mean, I guess there are historical figures where this is both a motif because it's this recurring theme you see all the time, but it also happens to be true. Maybe after years of being king of the universe, Cyrus got a little full of himself. Who knows, but that's the way this is portrayed, right? There's going to be an object lesson here and the person that is going to stick it to cyrus and teach him this lesson is going to be a queen, you know, but you have to think of like an Amazonian Queen. This isn't some woman who's walking around in velvet, you know, on a throne being fan. I mean this is a person who probably once upon a time was killing

Speaker 2:          03:12:52       men in hand to hand combat. Now, did this woman really exist? Who the heck knows? There is no historical confirmation that I've ever seen that says that they found anything that proves this queen who's name, by the way, I used to call her tomorrow when I was growing up, but I've seen timorous, Tom Morris, number of different pronunciations. I think Shakespeare might've used her as a character, one of his plays. Nonetheless, you can say a couple of things. One, it wouldn't have been outrageous to think of her as a female warrior because these tribes actually had them. It may have been the actual root of the idea of Amazon's in sort of a mythology, so she could have actually been a killer warrior and also the tribe she was supposed to have lead was real all too real to some people. They were called the master guitar or the message tie. A dangerous, powerful, numerous tribal coalition that, you know, Hurghada is in his writings. He has to set it up and tell you what he knows, which isn't much. He, he says, I hear there a skiffy in people, which they kind of were.

Speaker 2:          03:14:03       You'd have to think of Mongolia type culture, but with people who were probably predominantly light skinned and ranging on the scale of looks from like a Turkic kind of look all the way up to people with blonde and red hair, blue and green eyes tall. There's a little viking side to them, a little bit of the Viking Ethos and building little sword worshiping and things like that. Supposedly once a year these people would have a scaffold erected and they'd put a sword on top of the scaffolding. Then they would march in, meet the scaffold. One out of every 100 prisoners that they captured over the year and execute them as a sacrifice to the sky. God, the son, God Mithras, I think it was. These are colorful, scary people. Just what you want in a story like this. Iran, this has already talked about their head hunting. The fact that they make, you know, drinking cups out of skulls and the really nasty warriors are the ones with the most cops.

Speaker 2:          03:15:02       He talks about their cannabis use. Again, this was the exotic barbarian. You want to hear what they do. He says they found this fruit that they can burn and then they sit around the fire, burning the fruit and it gets them intoxicated like wine gets Greeks intoxicated. So another little bit of that barbarian colored to throw in. He also points out according to him that they are very promiscuous. You might call them free love types or swinger is maybe anybody can sleep with anybody else's wife. He just has to put his bow, you know, alongside their tend to let them know you're interested I guess. So weed, smoking, headhunting blood drinking, wife sharing, Viking types. Who would not want that in a good story if you don't know anything and you're just trying to make the best story, make sure you include these people are test that Cyrus leads

Speaker 5:          03:15:50       and army up to this queens territory and then basically proposes marriage to her so it would be like a diplomatic alliance thing. And in Hurghada this says that she sees through this reus immediately saying that he just wants to conquer her people by marrying her. So then when she says no, he begins to try to set up what we would call today an amphibious river crossing. There's a big river that divides the territory. He's coming from, from the territory of these Central Asian horse nomads up in places like Kazakhstan and places like that today. And as Cyrus and the Persians were told, are building these boats, some of which have like towers, like fighting towers on them. She sends him a message. Now remember, she's going to be like the voice of Avenging Karma here in teaching cyrus a lesson. So her voice and the words that are brought, it just puts in her mouth from a screen.

Speaker 5:          03:16:44       Writers show runners point of view are designed to set this idea up right? You should know, but you don't. You know you're going to get what's coming to you. Here's what Hirata to says. This is the discipline core translation of her audit. This, by the way, quote King of the Medes, I advise you to abandon this enterprise for you cannot know if in the end it will do you any good rule your own people and try to bear the sight of me ruling mine, but of course you will refuse my advice as the last thing you wish for us to live in. Peace listened. Then. If you are so bent upon trying your strength against the massacre tie, give up the laborious task of building that bridge and let my army withdraw three days, March from the river, and then you come over yourself or if you prefer it, retire the same distance yourselves and let us meet you on your side of the river and quote, this barbarian Warrior Queen is basically saying to a guy whose title includes king of kings and King of the universe to come and get it, or I'll come over and take it from you.

Speaker 5:          03:17:54       That's a pretty strong female character, isn't it? And I was thinking that it makes Hurghada to at times look a little pro feminist, right? Like he like he's been looking for a good, strong female character. There's another reason maybe that would play well, maybe some of the people in his audience are women and it would be good to have a character that they can both relate to in cheer for. Finally, it might just be a dig at the manliness of the Persians, right? I mean, here's the greatest king that Asia has ever produced and he's about to be beaten and killed by a woman. Nonetheless in the story when she says, you know, do you want it over here? Do you want it over there? Cyrus in his generals and whatnot, sit down and have a conference about this. What do we do? Which choice do we take in? All his advisors say, let her come to our side of the river. One advisor though, says, no, no, no. Go over to her side. That advisor is our old friend, the king of Lydia

Speaker 2:          03:18:48       creases, who instead of being killed Hurghada. This has, you know, going in the story, sort of acting as advisor to Cyrus all the way through

Speaker 2:          03:18:57       increases. His advice is totally different. First of all, he says, you can't let her come over here and give grounded in front of her. It's a woman. It would look terrible. So there's that other little dig. He says, go over to her side. And then he says, and how about we do a little trick and he proceeds to tell Cyrus that they should essentially do the same thing to these people that the medes did to either these people are their cousins a generation before in a story you may recall, get them all drunk and kill them. My discipline core translation has creases, telling Cyrus to do it this way. Quote here then is my advice crossed the river advanced to the limit of the enemy's withdrawal and then get the better of them. Buy a piece of strategy. I have heard that these people have no experience of such luxuries as the Persians and joy and know nothing about the pleasures of life.

Speaker 2:          03:19:56       Let us take advantage of this fact and set out a banquet in our camp on the most generous scale with a great many sheep slaughtered and dressed all sorts of other dishes and bowls of strong wine in liberal quantities. Then when the banquet is all prepared, he says, let us March back to the river, leaving only a detachment of inferior troops behind. Unless I'm very much mistaken when our enemies. See all those good things they will set to work upon them and that will be our chance to distinguish ourselves by a bold stroke and quote again, is that a recurring motif or is that just a tactic that seems to work quite a bit? Who knows, but in the story we're told that the a third of the army shows up, kills the inferior troops, sees all the food and the wine proceeds to get, you know, very full and very drunk, and then the Persians come in and kill a bunch of them and capture some others. About a third of the army according to Hurghada tests included amongst the prisoners a general who also happens to be this barbarian queens son.

Speaker 2:          03:21:06       So now in this scenario, Hurghada is playing with his movies, turned into a little bit of a thriller with little chest match and all of a sudden the cyrus's side is captured a major piece, the son of the Queen. And so she issues one of these. I'll let you go now if you give me back my son kinds of speeches from the pervious translation. I brought it to says, quote, when to my wrist learned what had happened to her army and her son. She sent a herald to Cyrus with this message, blood thirsty cyrus. Do not gloat over what has happened here. You Persians. Indulge yourself with the fruit of the vine to the point of madness so that the wine into your bodies,

Speaker 5:          03:21:46       ugly words flow up and out of you. By such means you have tricked me and you've taken my son, prisoner, but not by supremacy and battle. Well then I urge you to follow this advice. Return my son to me. And despite the damage you have, cunningly wreaked upon a third part of the army of the massacre tie. You may leave this land unharmed if you do not do this. I swear by the sun, the Lord of the massacre. Tie that I will satisfy your thirst for blood in.

Speaker 2:          03:22:14       Well as you are in quote. So what Cyrus going to do with this interesting, powerful chest piece. He doesn't get the chance to decide because we're told that as soon as the queen's son sobers up finds himself, you know, hands tied or bound. He beseeches cyrus to undo his hands. Somehow Cyrus is convinced, and I like the way my relevance and translation puts it. The minute his hands were free, Rawlinsons Hurghada to says he destroyed himself, so he committed suicide. Now all of a sudden, cyrus just lost his piece, and this is when we're told the battle happens. This from the discipline core translation quote,

Speaker 5:          03:23:02       the queen on hearing that Cyrus ignored her terms, engaged him in the field with all the forces she possessed, the battle which followed, I judged to have been more violent than any other fought between foreign nations. According to the information that I have. The engagement began with the two armies coming to a halt within range of each other and exchanging shots with bows and arrows until their arrows were used up, after which there was a long period of close fighting with spears and daggers, neither side being willing to retreat. Finally, however, the massacre Gutei got the upper hand. The greater part of the Persian army was destroyed where it stood and Cyrus himself was killed. He had been on the throne for 29 years

Speaker 2:          03:23:43       years, and to quote, of course that doesn't quite twist the knife enough and have you leaving the performance, really thinking about some of the greater themes in life. So hirata tests from my pervious translation adds a Coda to the story. He writes, quote,

Speaker 5:          03:24:06       queen terrorists then filled a wine skin with human blood and searched for the corpse of Cyrus amongst the Persian dead. When she found him, she thrust his head into the wine skin, and as she does abused the corpse, she declared to it, I am alive and if conquered you in battle, but you have ruined me by taking my son through guile. Well then just as I threatened, I will slake your thirst

Speaker 2:          03:24:30       blood and quote. So if as the recurring Greek motif will later show that the Persians are surreal overreaches, I'm sure Hurghada does. His attitude here is that they should have learned their lesson with cyrus by the time cyrus exits the scene, though he's built an empire that stretches from modern day Pakistan all the way to the Mediterranean. I've been to Turkey down by the Red Sea to the borders of Egypt and out to the Central Asian step when he's taken you know, efforts and spent years organizing it in putting it in a form where it has a chance to live on after he's gone. Nonetheless, you cannot lose a person of that magnitude. You cannot lose an Alexander. You cannot lose an Napoleon. You cannot lose and have these people from such lofty heights removed from the scene without there being this huge vacuum a couple of hundred years after this time period, one of the people who will fill a vacuum and play a similar role and maybe eclipse this person will visit his tomb. Alexander the great along with some influential colleagues will go to the spot and the building that is assumed to be the tomb of Cyrus the great.

Speaker 2:          03:25:58       That tomb is still standing by the way, in modern day Iran, if indeed it was the tomb. It's interesting to think of Alexander climbing up there in a fully colorized historical era now, by the way, bringing with him people who will write about it afterwards. We actually have through another guy, the writings of someone who was with Alexander and kind of describes what the tune looked like, a lot of clothing, a lot of souvenirs, a lot of things that just sort of helped the guy into the afterlife sort of deal and then a body that was preserved in wax. We're told this, this was kind of a Persian custom too.

Speaker 2:          03:26:35       Now this might just be me, but I had this feeling that if the queen of the massive Gd or the Messa di had taken his head or something, that's a mutilation that they would have probably told us about. It's probable that the body looked pretty darn good because no one talked about it looking any other way. We're told that there was an inscription on the tomb. Now some historians think it must've been in front of the tomb because it's missing, but they were a couple of different descriptions from people who supposedly saw them. Some are more flowery than others. One that I liked that has a couple of different versions says quote mortal. I am cyrus son of Cam by ses who founded the Persian empire and was King of Asia. Grudge me not then my monument

Speaker 2:          03:27:24       and the quote, but there are other traditions also from eyewitness accounts originally that record a very different sort of epitaph. Some of the historians are like say it's much more traditionally Iranian to it's much more pithy and right to the point the Persians, when they were leading the empire, could put on the airs as well as any Mesopotamian dynasty ever did. They could heap on all the traditional titles. Queen Victoria had the empress of India. The kings of this area had king of the universe, King of the four corners of the earth, King of lands, and the Persians could do that, but sometimes when they were just recording for eternity, which is what a tomb inscription like this is, they adopted a different style. When the tomb inscription supposedly from an eyewitness that I liked the most, and I like to use Cyrus's Persian, he creek ish form of the name Kourosh or Kourosh. It says here I lie Kourosh, king of kings. The Persians grew up in the equivalent of a tough neighborhood

Speaker 2:          03:28:46       to show. You just heard, involved a lot of context. It didn't it where we discussed the background, where they sprung from, because this does a bunch of things. One, it makes their achievements all the more astounding. I mean they arose in this world with all these amazing competitors and manage to, you know, climb to the top of the heap. Anyway, it also helps us set a baseline for comparison. When we say things like the Persians are tolerant or lenient, you want to immediately say, compared to what the show you just heard gives us some idea what they might be compared to.

Speaker 2:          03:29:26       Finally, it's a fantastic story. This story that's usually relegated to dead air between two other stories, right? Somewhere between the fall of the Syria and the rise of Persia is the, you know, latter part of the six hundreds and the high five, 85, 95, five, 85. What's going on during that era. Normally it's sort of just a transition point between, you know, two chapters in a book. Whereas all by itself it's twisted and fascinating. And I love the idea of the great power like the US or the Soviet Union collapsing and the rest of the world sort of looking at each other over the, you know, smoke and ruins, trying to figure out who gets what and what are the things look like. Now. I love that. The key to this whole story at this point is, you know, when it took such a singular figure to put this improbable, you know, event together. What happens when that figure exits the scene? What are the odds of getting to Cyrus, the greats in the same family, one right after another.

Speaker 2:          03:30:26       Remember this is the largest empire in world history. The distance from one part to another is daunting. Then you have all these different people, people that are very independent minded and fractious and who gave the Assyrians fits all the time. So many different religions, so many different languages. How is in a one small minority of people going to rule this giant entity, especially without the specially gifted guy who built the whole thing. In the next episode we'll examine how you combat isis. The son of Cyrus manages all this and they will be coups and there will potentially be armies disappearing in sandstorms. There will be far too many Greeks probably for what the story really warrants, but you have to understand while we all know instinctively there important things going on in the east and the north and the other parts of the Persian empire that don't touch Greek lands. They only people writing about it in any sort of extended colorful way are the Greek, so just like everyone else will talk about the Greek and Persian wars will give some context of that battle of their monopoly movie scene with the Spartan. Say, come and take them

Speaker 2:          03:31:37       and then we'll deal with the guy. The next guy really in this story, who's personal talents are such that he's a game changer all by himself. The natural successor to Cyrus the great and the person who finally puts the stake in the heart of the black and white world, the son of Philip of Macedonia.
