Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Today's show is sponsored by audible. Get a free audiobook with a 30 day trial membership. Just go to audible.com, forward slash hardcore history or text the word hardcore history two, five, zero, zero dash five, zero zero to get started today. It's hardcore history. When I was designing this hardcore history denim format, I knew that we were going to want to do interviews. It's a good way for us to get out content quickly. That's interesting and that it involves other people, other voices, people that you might want to know more about and I knew that we would have authors on because there's always a lot of good people writing intriguing books because I'm reading them.

Speaker 1:          00:00:44       I knew we would want to have experts on from time to time because after all it's a great use of the medium, isn't it? And I was hoping that we could get some primary source people on from time to time participants in the events that we were talking about. In other words, you know, I'm not a historian because historians chronicle, you know, things for history and for footnotes and stuff in books. But maybe we could do a little bit of that if we were interviewing people who were participants in these sorts of events. Will today I have somebody that is sort of the Trifecta of interviews for this program cause he meets all three of those specifications. He's an author, he's an expert and he's a primary source and participant. His name is Merrill Mcpeak. He happens to be a four star air force general. He flew with the thunderbirds, the acrobatic team for the air force. He is a commander or a chief of staff in the air force and did so during the first Gulf War and he flew more than 250 combat missions in Vietnam. Imagine that for a second.

Speaker 1:          00:01:50       He's also a noted author who's got a brand new book out to add to his catalog of books. His new book is called roles and missions, which goes over his time as the 14th air force chief of staff. By the way, sort of a bipartisan guy, worked for the Bob Dole Republican campaign, also supported and was in the Barack Obama administration in terms of it military capacity. He writes about his time in Vietnam and his book called Hangar flying. He's got another one called below the zone, another one called the Vietnam chapters. If you like military history, especially air force history, Merrill, Tony Mcpeak is somebody whose books should be on your bookshelf. We talked to the four star general now who was nice enough to come and talk with us. By the way, you may have recently seen him in Ken Burns, recent multipart documentary on the Vietnam War as well. Welcome to the show general mcpeak.

Speaker 1:          00:02:50       First of all, let's get started by suggesting, um, you know, the person we were, we were contacting your publicist or whatever, uh, was discussing the 50th year, the Tet offensive. And when I was thinking about how to start this, I thought, you know, I grew up in that generation where we weren't in the war. We were in the early eighties, middle eighties. We were the ones learning about the war in college and the veterans would come and speak in our classes. And I remember 60 minutes did a whole big thing on how here we were studying the lessons of Vietnam. And what did we learn? And I thought now here we are decades later and I thought I would ask you 50 years after the Tet offensive, what do you think we learned and do you think the things we learned, for example, by the 19 seventies or 19 eighties, do you think those lessons stuck?

Speaker 2:          00:03:33       Well, speaking as a professional military guy, we learned a lot. We learned, for instance, just as an air force fighter pilot, we learned we had to hit what we were aiming. We've missed most of the targets. I think our average distance of Vietnam was like a 100 meters and that's not good enough if you're going after a target, like a bridge or a vehicle, like a tank or a truck. So we invented precision guided munitions and you've seen the results that we learned. We had to be able to operate at night and we now or nobody wants to fight us at night nowadays. They don't want to find the daytime either, but we, we re really dominate knife fighting. Now we've learned that we had to be invisible on radar. So in invented aircraft. So, I mean, from the standpoint of the professional military, we learned a lot and we improved a lot because the war lasted so long. Tenure for all of us got to go there at least once. We all saw what needed to be fixed and we fixed it. Now, if you now ask a what did we learn politically or socially, I think that the, by and large, the lessons were not learned at all. Or if they were, they were forgotten. Uh, we repeat the same mistakes, you know, a war after war, it seems to me. So, uh, technically we learned a lot, but big picture wise, I think we, we missed the boat,

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       you know, I'm thinking about the concept in business of like institutional memory, right? The idea is that, you know, you have, you have the, uh, the, the fact that the people can come and go in a large corporation, but theoretically when new people come in, they're trained with the lessons learned by the previous generation. I'm thinking about institutional memory in the military. So if you guys get a guy like William Westmoreland who was a second world war veteran, knows how to fight, that kind of war, has to deal with this counterinsurgency situation in Vietnam, theoretically learns what he's going to learn there. But then Westmoreland retires the people who were right below him retire. It is, is, is institutional memory in the military sphere. A little like something like a Bush in front of your yard that you have to keep cut back because every generation comes up, we have to relearn some of those same things.

Speaker 1:          00:06:01       Is there, you know, when you read like the Peloponnesian war and the stuff from ancient Athens, there's the hubris element. Is Hubris something that, that a good punch in the nose can, can teach you permanently? Or do you need to be reminded every now and then? I mean, I look at the dominance we have right now on the battlefield and I worry that if we got into a major conflict right now, we don't have anyone in the institutions at the higher levels now that have fought, for example, in a real war against another first world military. Um, would they almost have to do like the reverse of what Westmoreland had to do, where he had to learn to go from a world war mentality to a counterinsurgency mentality mentality if we ever had to fight China in some islands off, you know, in the east China Sea, is that relearning a kind of warfare that westmoreland understood. But we haven't done in so long we don't know how to do anymore. I'm sorry, that's a really long question.

Speaker 2:          00:06:52       Yeah. But it's a wonderful question because this, we're a practice to fight the last war. I think that's even giving too much credit. Look a your question is our military organizations learning organizations that can benefit through experience. I think they are, but remember we fought Vietnam with a, a draft force conscripted army, and it was only after that that Nixon was really forced to abandon the draft and to create the all volunteer force. The all volunteer force is that different kind of army from the army. And, uh, I think it's probably true that a professional force can be a learning organization, whereas buying large citizen based, uh, army, uh, are not because they're constantly taking in new guys or short term of service and they have to train them from the beginning every six months and, but, uh, but, but look, it's a good question.

Speaker 2:          00:08:13       It's a profound question. It goes back to the Peloponnesian wars or before that, as you say, and I'm not sure you know, that I have a total totally good answer to it. I know that the army coming out of Vietnam was not happy with its performance. Uh, Westmoreland Westmoreland's failures in particular, uh, and guys like Norm Schwarzkopf and Colin Powell set about rebuilding the culture of the army and the army we have today, I think it's considerably better than the one we had in Vietnam, which was guilty of fragging, its own officers and senior NCO and drug abuse and other forms of, of disciplined on the front lines. I don't think you see that kind of army anymore. So you'd have to say, I think that that we did learn from that experience. For me, the larger lessons. So are the policy level less than political lessons and there I've seen no evidence that we've learned very much. I am there. I see that this ancient Greek a problem, a few breaths to still around, you know, in spades

Speaker 1:          00:09:38       and again, this may just be one person. I'm shooting an Arrow and painting a bullseye around it afterwards. But it, it seems to me that there's always this wonderful out that people who want to do something like I want to invade Russia and I'm the, I'm the Nazi. Often someone comes up to me and says, well, you know, that didn't work out very well for Charles. The twelfth didn't work out very well for Napoleon, but I want to invade Russia. So I say yes, but they didn't have the offer and they didn't have the off. Therefore those historical lessons from the past are not applicable and I feel like there's a human tendency to do that. Even now, for example, to say if our military today went and rethought the Vietnam War in the 21st century, we could do that and we could win because of all this stuff we have that we didn't have back then. In other words, we can go into Afghanistan and it won't be the graveyard of empires because they didn't have smart bombs in those old days. Um, do you think that there's any validity to that way of thinking? Is that a little bit of a, of a human nature sort of thing? Or is there something you can do institutionally that says, listen, this is how human beings behave. So let's insulate ourselves from that typical human tendency. Does that make sense?

Speaker 2:          00:10:46       There is an element of a Shakespearean tragedy, man is a creature, right? And so, uh, you see these foibles pop up time. And again, let me, I will say this, that I think the professional military, especially at the senior level, uh, are reluctant fighters a fish. That's been my experience. Now I, you know, I didn't know George Patton, but by and large from my experience in the JCS and senior Washington levels, there's nobody looking for a fight. They're, uh, their advice uniformly has been slow down. You know, it really didn't work for Napoleon. So, uh, it's on the civilian side, uh, in case of the Middle East problems that we're having still today, the neo-cons know the guys who had never worn a uniform, a dick. Cheney had, uh, seven, uh, excuses for not going to Vietnam and the people around him in those levels. We're anxious to go back and do Iraq again. You don't have to really get Saddam. We're saying this time that wasn't military, that was a political people. And so the Hubris that I have seen has been wearing the dark blue suits not to uniforms.

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       Interesting. I had met General Mattis wants, and he had basically said something similar. He was very cognizant of the limitations of military power when I was talking to him. So then let me ask you this then. It seems to me that there's an institutional bias in this country and it's a human thing. It's, I don't blame anyone against, let's call it the can't do general as opposed to the can do general. So let's say we're talking about the 50th anniversary of Ted and we're talking about Vietnam and Johnson or Nixon brings in a couple of military advisors and out of the five of them, four of them say, of course we can win this war. Let me tell you how to do it, put me in charge and I'll do it. And one guy says, no, no, no, you're not going to win this. It's over.

Speaker 1:          00:13:00       Let's figure out a way to get out of here with honor. Isn't there a natural tendency to say, listen, the can't do guy, I'm not going to go with that. I'm going to go with somebody who tells me he can get it done. And isn't there a sense in the military of, I don't want to be the guy that says we can't do this. I don't want to be thought of as the guy who says this is unwinnable. Of course you put me in charge and I'll get it done. Um, seems to me that it's, it's tough for someone to stand up in that sort of situation and say, let's not do this. We wouldn't be successful. It wouldn't be prudent. Does that have any, when you're talking about the institutional failures with the people who wear suits, is that a problem that they're going to run into?

Speaker 2:          00:13:36       You know, Dan, again, you put a very deep question, but let me just say that isn't the way I have seen the problem formulated during my time in Washington now. I'm sure this changes as the cast of characters changes in Washington, but typically the president doesn't ask advice of five guys and uh, you know, for him. So yeah, I can do it. One Says No. What the president says is, Hey, we've got a problem here. What are my options? So he's not looking for a yes, no answer. It's not a binary problem. What he's looking for is, you know, Gimme a half a dozen things I might do here. Tell me the pros and cons of each thing. Let me make a decision. So, uh, in that case, it's, if you're opposed to taking a military action, you just put it in the conscious. So here's the deal, we're going to lose friends around the world, we're going to lose international standing, a trade's going to dry up or whatever. You can put an econ and you want, but, but the, the proper approach from the military advisors is to say, okay, if you want to do this, here's how you, here are a set of options and the, and the and the, uh, and the pluses and minuses to go with them and then it's up to you. So it's a little different formulation than the one you put.

Speaker 1:          00:15:08       Okay? So if you're the military advisor and you've been in the role of been chief of staff before you, you've been the air force, uh, a four star general here. I mean, if somebody comes to you, the presence that I need your advice on this and he says something to the effect of, um, Oh God, I'm losing my train of thought. General. I'm getting old now. Fifty two, just a little low. I know I'm getting their aging quickly. Okay, here's what I wanted to get with that. So, so, so the old line about the Vietnam War was the political nature of the president, for example, operating as a person who's picking tactical targets for aircraft to bomb. And yet the old argument that we learned back in, in military history class for why that might have been necessary was the president's got to worry about, you know, Soviet involvement, the threats of nuclear war, you know, other things happening, including maybe funding a, the very people you're fighting at a higher level to compensate.

Speaker 1:          00:16:06       Whereas the guys on the ground, the military leaders are worried about, okay, how do I get victory in this theater of operations? What is the proper balance in your mind between a president who's got to worry about the grand strategy across the world and the general who's got to say, listen, if you just take your hands off of me, I'll win this theater for you. Um, how do you see the balance of the general says, you know, general mcpeak, if the President says, General Mcpeak help me out here, what do you tell them to do? Visa VI allowing generals to have a free hand versus a Lyndon Johnson who's maybe more worried about the Soviet Union than he is about making sure no more resupply ships get into Haiphong harbor.

Speaker 2:          00:16:47       Yeah. Well, this is a problem which is at the heart of limited warfare. Uh, if for instance, you asked Curt Lemay

Speaker 1:          00:17:09       representative

Speaker 2:          00:17:10       a bomb went back into the stone age. In fact, he did say that and we could have won had we knew Tannoy the war would've been over right. So the war was always winnable. It was just a question of what means, how limited are the means you want to use you. So you go to the presenter, okay. I'm assuming you don't want to use nuclear weapons. I mean, we have an instance case right now that's very relevant. North Korea. So if we seek to intervene in North Korea, the first question we should ask ourselves is, is this a limited war or the means we're going to use limited now? And not just the message, it will have a limited amount of time. No. Are you going to put a limit on the amount of money we're going to spend? So you have to decide all of the boundaries of the limitations you're going to put on warfare and then that has to be bought by the president.

Speaker 2:          00:18:13       I mean you have to tell President Johnson, okay, if I have to worry more about the Soviet Union and I do a winning in quotes and say in South Vietnam, that's fine. Just tell me that and that means I can't mine Hanoi harbor and blow up some Soviet boat. Now are you willing to live with that? So the president has to understand that the nature of the war, it's going to be limited and that means we may or may not win. If it's unlimited, I know we can be north Vietnam or North Korea anytime. So the first question you have to ask are, what limitations are you going to put on me? So we understand all of that. Typically today we don't talk in terms of limited war. We talk in terms of rules of engagement. What rules of engagement is the president or the secretary of defense or the theater commander or whatever going to impose on operations, and we need to be eyes wide open about that upfront.

Speaker 2:          00:19:19       Now inside the rules of engagement, I would argue you ought to give the military guy as much flexibility as possible. I don't want the president picking targets in the basement of the White House, you know, because he doesn't know much about targeting a no. He's going to pick the wrong targets. Where are you gonna? Tell me to attack them from the wrong direction or it's going to tell me to use the wrong munitions or he's gonna. Tell me to send to few airplanes or too many airplanes. Those are. Those are questions that he knows very little about and what he needs to do is impose rules of engagement. Tell me what the limitations are and leave me alone. And then as long as I operate inside the limitation, she should never have no any kind of a quibble or complaint about how I'm, how I'm doing and what the result is.

Speaker 2:          00:20:13       So the consequence, you know, the fact is we never lost a battle in Vietnam. We just lost the war and uh, so he has, and I'm not a big fan of West Berlin, I regard him miss rather dumb and mean that is what he tried to do with stupid in my opinion and not much, not much improved when he was succeeded by the Abrams, although there's a big school of thought that says Abrams was a much more talented officer and we were on the right track once we got rid of. But in any case, you know, the point is that there are things that politicians are expert in and there are things that professional military or expert in and we need to understand who, who, who does what here, when you're picking targets in the basement of the White House, you're on the wrong track and you are going to lose, in my opinion, because you got the wrong guy doing the wrong thing

Speaker 1:          00:21:15       on the right track. I think that's a key point. So when I'm watching Ken Burns Vietnam documentary, one of the things that just screams at you, I was reminded once again at the veterans coming into the class I was in the 19 eighties, was it screams at you, is that you don't have any real way of determining how you're doing at any given time. I mean the classic way that was used was body count, but we understand that if you don't have body counts, it's how you. How do you measure progress in a way that's helpful to the heads of the military, the political heads and the population as a whole. And we could apply this to the situation in the Middle East for example, right now. I mean, how do you gauge progress and if progress isn't going the way you want, do you double down on the efforts or do you determine that?

Speaker 1:          00:22:01       Maybe. I mean are we even capable of cutting loose? Was there ever another choice? In Vietnam we act like we could have just said, listen, we're losing the war so let's get out. But you know, isn't the most difficult thing in the world to disengage from combat with an enemy strategic level or tactical level. So I guess what I'm asking is, um, how do you gauge progress whether or not you're winning or losing, and then do you notice if it's not in your interest to notice that your, for example, not winning, you know, can you get. Because in the Vietnam War you're looking at these people that just seem in retrospect, they look like they know the war is over, but they can't say it, they can't prove it, they can't, they can't operate or do anything about it. They seem frozen in the condition. So there seems to me to be a real need to be able to measure progress and then have some sort of reaction to the data you're getting. Um, can you, can you suggest a way maybe we could do that in the Middle East right now. And if we decided it wasn't going well, what do you do then? Well, I mean, isn't this the crux of the issue? Right? Are we winning or losing? And if we're winning or losing, what do you do about it?

Speaker 2:          00:23:10       Just quickly for the answer. But no, there used to be a way of judging. It was pretty easy territory. Uh, you want, if, if you prevail, if you held the battlefield at the end and the other guy left, you were winning, right? So Churchill could be very worried about what was going on in north Africa because Ronald pushed all the way to Alabama, you know, he was inside Egypt, right? For Cairo. And the Suez Canal was threatened because the geography told Churchill that he was losing. So we replaced a whoever it was with, uh, uh, Montgomery, uh, it's not so in a linear war where armies face each other, you can tell who's winning by, where the front line is and what direction it's moving. Or at least that's, that's one gross approximation. No, if you're fighting and Gettysburg, you're not in good shape.

Speaker 1:          00:24:15       Totally.

Speaker 2:          00:24:16       Okay. So you got to be fighting and Chancellorsville or someplace downtown. Now it's not so easy anymore with a stateless actors like Isis or, uh, you know, a suicide bombers. How can you tell if you're winning? I mean the guys doesn't have any territory to capture. He doesn't have a national treasury that you can loot. He doesn't even really have a life worth living otherwise you wouldn't be in the suicide bombing does. Right? He doesn't care about his own life. So in this, in this kind of war, how do you judge where you are? I don't think we have already answered to that. You know there's there, if we had a sort of an index of violence, he would say, well the violence is down and we kind of have that, but in Afghanistan now we have the Taliban bombing again inside Kabul. Right. And so the number, you can plot the number of incidents on a graph and say and just say, well they're more incidents this month and there were less month.

Speaker 2:          00:25:28       You're not doing very well. And in fact that's what I'm doing in the Middle East now, sort of subjectively. I don't know. I don't have a chart in my office that I keep track of this specifically, but it seems to me I get. I have the sense that we're not doing very well in Afghanistan and Iraq and uh, you know, I, I don't know how to come unstuck from it. This is a tar baby kind of deal where you say, Gee, I wish I could figure out how to get out of here with my pride and, you know, a reputation and shape. I don't see a way to do it. Uh, we're, we're kind of stuck to the problem in the Middle East and who knows how to judge whether we're doing better or poorer than we were. Uh, you know, not to go a year ago, five years ago, hard to say.

Speaker 1:          00:26:23       It's funny you say that. I wasn't expecting that answer because it leads you to the next question, which is, if you can't figure out how you're doing and if you really don't have any options, if you're totally stuck. You know, I remember being told a long time ago by my stepfather who was trying to explain to me the wide range of presidential actions that I always assumed was possible was a myth. And that when you actually got into the office, it was really much more constrained by, by what your predecessor left you, a bunch of other things like, you know, I can't fight the Vietnam war the way I want because the Soviet Union might get involved. Um, when you look at the current, let's call it the war on terror situation, I don't see. I mean, how do you get out of that when, I mean, you know, the old, the old equation, which is it costs these elements that we're fighting pennies on the dollar compared to what it costs for us to counter them.

Speaker 1:          00:27:13       I mean the longterm graphing out of that situation looks horrible. If you know, it's, I, I feel like we could be doing a documentary with Ken Burns 150 year old Ken Burns years from now having the same conversation about the current situation we're in, in the war on terror that I just saw the other night when I was watching the Vietnam war documentary. And if that's the case, you know, you get this feeling like Deja Vu all over again or a train wreck that you've seen before and that it's happening in slow motion, but you're finding out exactly how limited the people in the late sixties were in terms of their options. Does it feel like that to you at all? Or does it seem like a tough. Because the context of the Cold War and all that is so different. Um, how similar to you would you feel if you were a president in office in Lyndon Baines Johnson's chair versus, um, Donald Trump's chair.

Speaker 2:          00:28:02       Don't ask me that one.

Speaker 1:          00:28:03       Okay. We can go back and see if it makes it easier.

Speaker 2:          00:28:09       Key issue is how do you define factory? Another way of saying what, what's our purpose? What's our goal? If you tell me what our purpose is in the Middle East, I'll tell you how we're doing. You tell me how to define victory in the Middle East. And I'll tell you whether we're on the 10 yard line, the 15 yard line and 50 yard line where we are. But I don't recall anybody ever saying, here's our objective, here's, here's how we would define victory. And if you don't have a definition of victory, then you don't know when to quit or our window retire or how to get out, you know, because you can't tell. You know, we, we'd like to. I mean, George W dot Bush famously went on a aircraft carrier instead under a sign that said mission accomplished. I remember that. That was how many years ago? So at least 15. We're still in Iraq. If our mission was accomplished when George W dot Bush went on that boat and declared victory, what the heck are we still doing in Iraq?

Speaker 1:          00:29:23       Well then you get back to your question though about is this is everything we're facing now, sort of a bit of blowback. I mean, do we stir up a hornet's nest and we're still dealing with individual Hornets and it would have been better had we left, you know, the Hornet and chief Saddam Hussein in charge because at least we weren't the ones who had pick up the pieces. I mean, I guess you know what, what amateur armchair historians like yours truly do general as you almost certainly know as we look at these and we try to find meaning from the past, which is this, this, this horrible fool's game. But, but, but I mean, when you look at this, you go, I mean, you almost get to a point where you say, would Saddam Hussein and the Middle East we had in 1991 be an applicable trade that a modern politician would, would trade today if they could get back to that?

Speaker 2:          00:30:10       Yes. In fact, I would have traded at the time I wrote an op Ed pieces and made speeches against Iraq. It drove me out of the Republican Party. You know, I ended up supporting Obama in 2008. In fact, I was the national culture of his presidential campaign and the issue for me was how badly a that whole thing had been handled and putting my buddy Colin Powell going in front of the General Assembly and making outrageous claims claims. Did I? I thought I knew. In fact, at the time, we're wrong about Saddam Hussein's having weapons of mass destruction or the other lies that were told, you know, Saddam Hussein and bin Ladin, we're good buddies. Bologna. There wasn't any al Qaeda in Iraq, as long as the dom was saying was they hated each other or that we would be welcomed as liberator's. You know, people would throw bouquets of roses as our guys going into Baghdad.

Speaker 2:          00:31:21       Bologna as it turned out. So I said that it's a diamond and you know, a trillion dollars later and thousands of lives later, we're stuck with in Iraq that is much worse than what it was when Saddam Hussein was running it. So, uh, you know, the real issue here is what are our purposes? How do we define victory? What limitations are we going to put on our use of violence to achieve these purposes? These are very deep questions, very hard questions to answer. And, uh, and then frankly, most, most presidents need as much help as possible to get to these answers that they need help from, you know, wise and good military advisors, which I don't think they, they always get.

Speaker 1:          00:32:13       You were just talking a second ago about Colin Powell respected military authority, but using that authority, uh, um, as part of an effort to sell the American people and the world on, on a particular foreign policy move. And it occurs to me, you know, one of the things that, that watching the Ken Burns Vietnam documentary really brings home is the context of what a different America. It was back in the, when Vietnam was heating up the early 19 sixties. I was born during the Yod rang battle. I mean, so 1965 when things are really heating up with ground troops. Um, the government at that time was assumed to be telling the truth by just about everyone. It was a black and white good and evil world. Um, you know, I always tell young people when I'm talking to them, I always bring up the first world war and I talk about a generation of people that could watch, uh, the, the unit in front of them, step out of the trenches and go over the top and be machined gun within 10 yards of the trench.

Speaker 1:          00:33:13       And then the next wave will do the same thing. And I said we wouldn't do that today in the same way that much of the stuff that in 1962 era American would've considered a truism, um, would be much more skeptically by a 21st century American. How much did you know the, the, so called credibility gap over several administrations in that era, do you know lasting the boy who cried wolf type damage to our government's ability to be trusted with statements like how the war is going or anything else? What did we sort of. Did we lose our innocence? I guess as a classic phrase from my 19 eighties, Vietnam War, military history class?

Speaker 2:          00:33:55       Well, in particular, the Pentagon papers, you know, after they were published in the New York Times, The Washington Post, uh, Americans came to understand that a succession of administrations, both Democrat and Republican had systematically lied to the American people. And I don't think that was that our country has ever been the same again, the skepticism, uh, which that whole episode properly aroused has been with us ever since. And I frankly, it is a loss of medicines for us. And, and if you look at our history, we were never a great power until after World War One. So our, our, uh, experience on the world stage was pretty limited, uh, you know, maybe 50 years of experience as a, as a real actor in international affairs. And then finally we, we woke up a bit, we saw how that sort of thing happens. It's not, the government weren't cynical before. I think the Brits were, the British government has been cynical, you know, for a long time, but Americans were truly a children of the frontier, uh, you know, with, with a sort of a, a Western heritage frontier parentage. And we wanted to believe that our government was telling the truth, but we learned in the Pentagon papers that that's not so. And ever since we've been, I think properly skeptical.

Speaker 1:          00:35:53       I guess the logical question is why do you think, you know, I think the tendency would be to blame some president from the opposite political party and, and demonize them. But as you said, this was a, a multi administration effort to keep from the people who are supposed to understand what's going on so they can be informed voters from really knowing what's going on. And it started with, you know, Eisenhower even, but even to the end with Nixon and Christmas bombings that were secret. I mean, what was, I guess, was it kept secret in your mind for, for military reasons or was it kept secret because the reaction of the American people to their own policies was what the government was worried about.

Speaker 2:          00:36:38       I think it was the latter. Really. The government didn't. The president didn't want to be embarrassed. Embarrassment is the worst possible situation for a public figure. And so the bombing of Cambodia, for instance, was a secret from the American people. It's sure as hell wasn't secret from the Cambodians what are the north Vietnamese army, which was using Cambodia for sanctuary. They knew all about it. So the secrecy, there wasn't a military necessity at all. The enemy quite understood what was going on. The, the, the secrecy was required to keep the American people in the dark. And the only, the only reason for that is the government would have been embarrassed to admit what was going on. That's the worst possible reason to, uh, classify a, any information is to protect, to protect yourself from embarrassment. But that's exactly what was going on.

Speaker 1:          00:37:44       Do you think that the efforts of the media today are. I want to compare them to the media efforts in Vietnam, which we're so scrutinized and yet perhaps so influential on what went on and I just, I'm not even sure we're talking apples and oranges here in the, in the ability to compare them, but how would you compare today's media coverage of America's conflicts and that, for example, take 19, 67, 68? Because it was very different in 62, but how would you, how would you compare the media's job, how they cover with the restrictions by the way that we understand? I mean they don't have the same kind of ability to show this. I mean the combat footage that, it, not to change the subject but, but the thing that rocked me in Ken Burns' documentary the most, and I have no idea how he did it, is there's segments where you'll see 35 seconds in a row of that looks like it was shot yesterday, high definition stuff. And you know, for people like me who've seen a lot of that footage, I couldn't figure out if it's computer enhanced or what, but, but when you're looking at what the media is able to show back then and the difference in the coverage today, can you compare in your mind's eye, um, the pros and cons of the way we did it then and how we do it now?

Speaker 2:          00:39:03       Media coverage in Vietnam was by and large positive in my opinion, except for photo coverage. You know, the, the, the impact of a photograph or today video is so much more, uh, a pervasive or influential or stocking know you got a photograph of a, of a police general in Saigon shooting or a guy in the head or a, or a, a very young girl running away from the village. It's been an avon. Whether skin on fire these pictures, uh, convey a message in a way that written journalism or broadcast journalism cannot. And, and they were very negative. I mean a Buddhist monks, you know, emulating themselves in the streets of Saigon when you show that you show it on television, it just is merciless and the message it can base. And so for my money, until Walter Cronkite, uh, came on CBS news and said, hey, we're not winning guys.

Speaker 2:          00:40:20       After 10, uh, the, the coverage was pretty universally supportive. The written coverage, but the photographic coverage underlie just, just, uh, undermined everything that was being said in print. Now today it's a, the coverage is much more visual, much more video oriented and photo oriented. And so the bad news hits earlier I think because photo, you know, you don't see a photograph of, of a ribbon cutting, so it has downtown Baghdad is liberated. You see these awful scenes of devastated towns that we're creating in the Middle East. I mean there's no getting around it. We're, we're in a large scale destructive mode. They're in the Middle East and that's what people are seeing. They're not seeing any upside, you know, you can talk about upside all you want and how well we're doing and so forth. But what we are seeing is awful. The consequences of combat there. And so I think the coverage today is much more pessimistic and skeptical and even perhaps a cynical but because they are showing not just telling and from now on I expect that's a way that coverage will be. Because this gentleman, you know, our younger generation is much more video oriented and won't read the New York Times. Watch it on, you know, on facebook.

Speaker 1:          00:42:03       Yeah. Once upon a time it used to be Radio Free Europe trying to get a little teeny signal over the iron curtain. Now that if we were fighting the north Vietnamese army, they would have a troll of people on twitter, you know, giving their side of the story or pretending to be Americans

Speaker 2:          00:42:20       complete with photographs.

Speaker 1:          00:42:24       Fake photographs. Yes, exactly. You're right. Well then let me, let me ask you a little bit of not really changing subjects, but I can't have a four star general on here without mining you a little bit for some knowledge and wisdom myself. I'm looking at Syria and I'm looking. You had talked about, you know, in destructive mode right now, but to have an arm chair person like me, it looks like a terribly small theater to have that many different forces operating in and us hoping to keep everything clean with no major mistakes and whatnot. Um, you had talked about North Korea as well. Can you talk to me a little about those two hot spots and if there's a third one you would add to the mix of places we need to be careful right now

Speaker 2:          00:43:08       is the most important and threatening problem that we face anywhere in the world or have faced for a long time. I really think we're up against a, a sort of a Cuban missile crisis, so it's been that long since we've really been looked down the barrel gun drill as far as Syria goes. Um, it is an awfully small theater of operations, especially on the air side. We're talking about aircraft like the, uh, [inaudible] that that's super cruise. In other words, there are supersonic there. They're running around the sky at one point seven, one point eight bucks all the time and that makes Syria pretty small countries even do a one, a two, a 180 degree turn in, you know, and the Russians are, they're sharing that airspace now. We've so far been able to coordinate that air activity pretty well, even though the Russians did lose a fighter to a circuit, to a target or a ground fire.

Speaker 2:          00:44:17       So, but the less, you know, we're running a head to head against each other in a very small airspace and it's a tribute to the professionalism of our air force that we haven't already shot down a few of those guys. Uh, but that's, uh, that's terribly dangerous. We could be any day involved in a head to head fight with Russian aircraft and where that, you know, that that's got the potential to go, to escalate, to go anywhere. So it's dangerous in my opinion. It's less dangerous than the situation in North Korea where we have apparently a crazy guy in charge of a, a government that is the, does possess nuclear weapons and is rapidly developing the capability if it doesn't already have them to deliver those nuclear weapons against American cities. Uh, I think that's an awful situation. I think we can't allow that to continue.

Speaker 2:          00:45:24       I believe we must intervene and do something there. Now what should we do? Well, I'm in favor of using all the tools in the toolbox. If you think diplomacy will work, by all means, let's do it. If you think we can, uh, you know, economic sanctions will work. Let's impose them. If you think the Chinese can help us or the Russians can help us. Well, I all means let's involve them. At the end of the day, I think we've tried just about everything here and nothing has worked so far because what we have to do is dismantle its nuclear capability. We can allow, in my opinion, North Korea to continue to develop a nuclear, uh, me threats against the American American homeland, property and citizens and institutions and so forth that, that has to be dismantled and I believe it has to be dismantled relatively quickly. We don't have forever to deal with this problem or it will get to a point where we can't deal with it now. I think we should deal with it with conventional weapons and I rather than use nuclear weapons against North Korea. And I think we still have the capability to do that too. Just to help the, you know, them dismantled its capability. Well, we need to get with it pretty soon because, uh, you know, Time's running out on him.

Speaker 1:          00:46:52       Go back to some of the constraints maybe that a guy like Johnson was operating under. What if the Chinese or Putin's government tell us, no, don't do that.

Speaker 2:          00:47:05       Well, I don't think. Well, we know that already. First of all, but remember the North Korean nuclear capability is a bigger threat to Beijing, a bigger threat of glad of a stock and it is to Honolulu or Chicago, so there's every reason to believe that they would wish to cooperate us. If not, then so be it. No, we, we have the means to deter China and Russia. We've shown that already. The question is we don't, I think know for sure or, or with great enough probability that we can deter North Korea. I mean, I've heard it argued that this guy, Kim Jong Gun is a rational person. All he wants to do is hold power. Therefore he has something to lose. Therefore he detour trouble and I think that's probably right. My question is, what if it's well, what are the odds that he's not the terrible? Say there, say it's only 10 percent, so do we want to make it a bit?

Speaker 2:          00:48:19       Again, we want to bet Chicago or New York City that he's deterrent will when the odds are 10 percent say that he's not the terrible. I don't think we want to take that bet. And by the way, at the overview ought to be here about nuclear proliferation. Where are we going to draw the line? Is it okay for Nigeria or Honduras or a Bailey's to have nuclear weapons? What is the, what is the point of which we are going to put our foot down and say, no, we've gone far enough, you know, it's enough that 10 or so countries that are acting responsibly so far have nuclear weapons. But that's enough where the world is dangerous enough, you know, without a Astonia having a full up nuclear delivery capability. So, but in any case, we now have a case which I think is as clear as can be that says we need to stop this process here. If America possesses armed forces for any reason, it is to protect the property and the institutions and the lives of Americans against threats like North Korea as a nuclear armed North Korea, I believe we ought to draw the line and we ought to give a deadline by one January next year. Either the new, the North Koreans are dismantling this capability under international inspection or we will help dismantle it.

Speaker 1:          00:50:09       It's funny you jumped the gun and went right to my next question, which was about nuclear nonproliferation because I wanted to ask you, is it specifically in North Korean problem or is it a, is it, you mentioned believes, right? Okay. Is it a beliefs problem? So here's my question though. This reminds me a little of like certain naval treaties between the two world wars where we're telling certain powers, listen, this is 70 plus year old technology, the, the basis for nuclear weapons, right? Um, and, and when you're telling other countries that they can never develop that capability, isn't that the equivalent of locking them into second power status permanently in the way that the, you know, the Japanese had to have six battleships to every 10 British battleships. I mean, is that, uh, it, it seems to be the farther we get away from, from when that technology was invented, the weirder it gets to tell people, listen, you can have anything. But something that was invented darn near 100 years ago is that she should the foreign policy of the country be that no nuclear powers that aren't currently nuclear powers should be allowed to become nuclear powers.

Speaker 2:          00:51:16       No, the foreign policy of nuclear zero that we would like to see a world without nuclear weapons. We would be much safer. I mean our superiority and conventional warfare is so pronounced that if nuclear weapons disappeared everywhere in the world, it would improve the safety and security of the American people. And so our policy ought to be a zero nuclear weapons for anybody. Now, how do we get there? I have no idea because a country like say Israel, which commonly is understood to possess an inventory of nuclear weapons is not going to renounce them a given its security situation, you know, and the geography lives. So I don't know if a practical way to get to zero. I think it ought to be our objective and I think we ought to work on it and try to get there and eventually hopefully we can get there.

Speaker 2:          00:52:21       But that ought to be our policy objective. And in the meantime, we ought to say a yes, nobody else can do it, doesn't have them now is going to get them and it's going to reduce them to second class status and that's too bad going to have to live with it. But you know, the world is increasingly dangerous. The more people get that capability. And uh, so it does freeze people into a sort of a formulaic, a position like we tried to do with capital ships at one time. Remember though, we, this is not the first time we've, we've outlawed chemical munitions, right? Sure. Worldwide, hopefully and now, and we to enforced that a bit so we can, uh, put certain limitations that we hope are universal on the kind of munitions that are available for use in hostile, uh, engagements.

Speaker 1:          00:53:24       Okay. About a conventional

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       situation then of, of a, of a change in power. So you look at something like in Iran, in their region, uh, all of us history not to know that, that traditionally Iran or Persia is one of the, we'll call them the regional superpowers. Right? And they wax and wane, but sometimes they dominate the region. Um, it seems like the policy sometimes is we're not going to let anyone change the power relationships that are currently in place. Is that a viable, it seems to be a hedge demonic power sort of way of looking at it. But is that a viable way to look at something like the Middle East and say, no, you're not going to expand your, um, influence into Syria even if that's a traditional Persian area of expansion? Do you see where I'm going with this? I mean, how much can we, uh, we'll call it the United States is the tip of the spear, but we all represent a bunch of major powers. How much can we be the congress of Vienna, but constantly, you know, making sure that things stay stable, we'll call them stable, for lack of a better word. So, nuclear stability, you're all for what about even like regional power, shifting stability?

Speaker 2:          00:54:30       We are no doubt a status quo power because we're the top dog. So we don't want that to change. And hopefully I've never changes. I mean, if this country lasts a thousand years and we all prayed, well, we, we want to be at the top of the heap for that whole period of time. However, you can't stand up the beaches edge and an order that tied not to get your feet wet, you know, so change is inevitable. And uh, what we have to do is to find a constructive ways to allow change to occur. It doesn't threaten our position and there's every reason by the way, that we ought to be able to do that. I mean, uh, certainly the tech technical change that we see in the last, uh, couple of decades has been led by us. We've created the instability onto the, you know, the technological front. So it serves our purposes to be in the vanguard of change where it's positive. We just have to figure out where is it positive negative. Now, in the case of Iran, think it's been a long time since there is the great, it's a, as a, you know, Syria recently, it's certainly been the Ottoman Empire, which not version Syria was a, was a Ottoman province. It was packed up by a

Speaker 1:          00:56:08       Yay

Speaker 2:          00:56:09       at the end of World War One. And, and by the way, Lebanon was created separately. I mean, Syria considers Lebanon a Serbian province,

Speaker 1:          00:56:20       Christian French enclave, right?

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       So, uh, this, this, the question you asked requires sophistication in the answering. It required sophistication in the asking, but uh, so, so statesmen are judged by their ability to recognize what change is coming anyway and running around and getting in front of it. Right? That's how we define statesmanship and cheap politicians are defined as people who don't understand, don't understand besides the depth I've sat here and, and mind you for wisdom on current affairs and wisdom on the Vietnam War. At no point did I ask you about the drama though of flying hundreds of missions into that situation and what I would assume was a, a more tense situation as, as a anti air defenses got stronger and stronger. This is the understated question of all time, but can you describe to me just for a second what the heck? I mean, when you look back on it, I did things that were nothing like what you did and I think, God, I was crazy. And do you ever look back on that and just think to yourself, was that a different person or is it like yesterday for you? Do you miss it?

Speaker 2:          00:57:46       Combat is partly because of Hubris. I mean, I was arrogant. Still am probably. I mean, my friends, my friends say I was arrogant, but when I did a strapped into an airplane, I don't think anybody can beat me. So, uh, I never was a, for me it wasn't a matter of bravery or courage to go out there because I, I knew I was going to kick the crap out of the other guy rather than the reverse. So for me, combat I food 285 combat region. Uh, I loved every, every minute of it and I miss it. I mean, it's really, really fun. Uh, and it's hard to explain. I mean, I am a professional warrior, you know, so that's, that's what I was cut out to do and I enjoyed it a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:58:46       And I'm going to recommend that people read your books to get a really, a more detailed version of everything we were just talking about general. Uh, did I, did I ask everything you would like to talk about? Is there anything that you'd like to bring up that I left out?

Speaker 2:          00:59:01       No, this has been a pretty wide ranging conversation and more philosophical then. And uh, I'm uh, equipped to deal with you. Ask Your questions or are too good. I mean, nobody had including your, this, uh, you spoke to the Peloponnesian wars. Nobody has the answers to these questions and they're not, it's not good to ask her professional, a military guy. You got to. These are questions for the philosophy professor. Not For me, but certainly it's been as wide ranging as I could desire. And, and, and more so than I'm pretty, uh, any good at handling

Speaker 1:          00:59:43       general, you appreciate yourself. I tailored those questions after watching you talk. And I think you're absolutely. And you know what's funny is when I met General Maddis, I thought that's how he thought to. You're very well versed in wide ranging yourself.

Speaker 2:          00:59:55       Dan. Thanks very much. I enjoyed talking to you buddy.

Speaker 1:          01:00:02       My thanks to General Mcpeak for coming on the program and putting up with my traditionally unusual and long winded questions. His books are available everywhere. We willing to. Some of them on our website. His latest, as I said, is roles and missions. Cataloging his time as the 14th chief of staff of the air force. He's a fascinating guy. I think you can agree and I appreciate him coming on the program.

Speaker 1:          01:00:30       I am a true believer in the idea that reading makes you a more formidable version of you and it's hard to read these days, isn't it? To find time to devote to simply looking at a page for hours. It's wonderful. I love it, but it's hard to do, isn't it? In this busy world, a lot of people like to combine things they have to do with things they'd like to do. Got to drive somewhere in traffic. Why not make yourself a more formidable version of you and enjoy a good book while you're doing it? Cause you got to keep your hands on the wheel. You got to keep your eyes on the road. So let's make it an audio book and if you're going to do that, let's get it from audible. The long running sponsors of this program who helped make it possible for you to educate yourself, entertain yourself, and read while you do something else.

Speaker 1:          01:01:23       It would be hard to find anyone who's made it easier, figured out more angles and things that you would like as part of the process. I mean, you sign up for audible, you get a free 30 day trial membership, you'll get a free audio book. You sign up for good. They just keep coming and audibles figured out a way to do this better than anyone else. I mean, take for example, they're whisper sync for voice aspect of this whole thing where you can switch back and forth between reading texts and listening to the audio book across a whole bunch of devices. I mean you're reading on your kindle and then you have to leave. So you go into your car and you'll listen in there. You get out of your car, your Amazon Echo, place it right from where you left off. That's pretty cool, isn't it?

Speaker 1:          01:02:06       Don't miss a word. You can share a book from your library with anyone. If it's their first time accepting a book and they can listen to it for free and you own your books. This is key. Me. I don't want to buy something and then not own it. With audible. You own the books that you purchase through them now. What books should you purchase? Well, of course, whatever you think is going to make a more formidable you, but for me, I am just addicted to reading the accounts of participants in things like the extremes of the human experience. I mean, take for example, I'm Tony Mcphee, who we just had on the four star general love that stuff, but at Vietnam is not your thing or you're more of a land war person. Well, how about war as I knew it by General George Patton, probably the most famous, arguably the most famous second world war US general.

Speaker 1:          01:02:57       This book is a little different because it is his remembrances and stuff out of his diary, but he died before the actual work that he was going to put together, came out, but it's about as close as you can get. The narrator even sounds a little patent issue. I mean, if you want the definitive account that exists from general George s dot patents, own written words, go get wars. I knew that if you're a military history person, it should be on your bookshelf anyway. If you are a person who does a lot of driving, who can listen to books while they work, well, then maybe you need the audible version to war as I knew it by General George Patton.
