00:00:04.121 --> 00:00:09.121
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't caught the earlier </v>

<v Speaker 1>and listen to them.</v>

5
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.480
<v Speaker 1>If you've already heard them or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't care about stuff like that,</v>

6
00:00:13.481 --> 00:00:18.481
<v Speaker 1>then please join us for part five of </v>

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.650
<v Speaker 2>be some bus seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

8
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 2>41 date which will live in infamy.</v>

9
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.160
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

10
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.880
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

11
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:39.620
<v Speaker 1>The events,</v>

12
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.970
<v Speaker 2>the figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lord,</v>

13
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 2>from this time and place I take pride in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the words,</v>

14
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 2>been the Alina tear down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Welcome this kind of examination because</v>

15
00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:19.950
<v Speaker 2>people have got to know whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>their president question,</v>

16
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a crop.</v>

17
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.370
<v Speaker 2>If we dig deep in our district and our I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't remember,</v>

18
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.520
<v Speaker 2>but we are not descended from fearful of</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

19
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 1>It's hardcore history.</v>

20
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Earlier in this story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we brought up the often quoted phrase </v>

21
00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:46.040
<v Speaker 1>that one man's terrorist is another </v>
<v Speaker 1>man's freedom fighter,</v>

22
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.910
<v Speaker 1>and we brought it up in relation to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>man who actually launched the incident </v>

23
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.891
<v Speaker 1>that sparked the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Serbian nationalist Gabriela </v>

24
00:01:56.891 --> 00:02:00.770
<v Speaker 1>apprenticeship who killed the heir to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Austro-hungarian,</v>

25
00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:05.771
<v Speaker 1>thrown the archduke Franz Ferdinand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thereby precipitating the crisis that </v>

26
00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:10.991
<v Speaker 1>actually started the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The austro-hungarian saw apprenticeship </v>

27
00:02:10.991 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 1>unequivocally as a terrorist is Serbian </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalist brethren revered him.</v>

28
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.340
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that long ago,</v>

29
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:21.490
<v Speaker 1>a statue was unveiled in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

30
00:02:21.491 --> 00:02:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Eva,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the assassination happened,</v>

31
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.500
<v Speaker 1>honoring the assassin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your view of the motives of these </v>

32
00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:33.490
<v Speaker 1>people really depends on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.540
<v Speaker 1>who's doing the viewing at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Print chip is far from the only figure </v>

34
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.550
<v Speaker 1>in this story who falls into a similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

35
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.240
<v Speaker 1>The United States is dealing with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

36
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.110
<v Speaker 1>In 1916,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

37
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:53.111
<v Speaker 1>in January of 1916,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as the German military is putting </v>

38
00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:56.261
<v Speaker 1>the finishing touches on what will </v>
<v Speaker 1>become the quintessentially horrible </v>

39
00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:01.901
<v Speaker 1>battle of Verdun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quintessentially century style </v>

40
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:05.821
<v Speaker 1>battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the killing field created by mass </v>

41
00:03:05.821 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>artillery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The meat grinder that will be verdun the</v>

42
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.170
<v Speaker 1>United States is attention is taken off </v>
<v Speaker 1>European affairs by events going on in </v>

43
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.591
<v Speaker 1>northern Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico has been convulsed by revolution </v>

44
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>since 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>

45
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Northern Mexico often becomes one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these hot beds of unrest and </v>

46
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>instability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in January 19,</v>

47
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:31.411
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gunman waylay a train in northern </v>

48
00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:31.411
<v Speaker 1>Mexico.</v>

49
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Now this is at the tail end of the era </v>
<v Speaker 1>where train robberies are not uncommon,</v>

50
00:03:38.341 --> 00:03:40.560
<v Speaker 1>but these gunman aren't there to rob the</v>
<v Speaker 1>train.</v>

51
00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:42.330
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they go up and down the aisles,</v>

52
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.290
<v Speaker 1>they leave the Mexican nationals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the locals alone,</v>

53
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 1>but they pull off every American from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the train that they find.</v>

54
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.350
<v Speaker 1>They find 16 to 18 workers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Employees have a US corporation </v>

55
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.930
<v Speaker 1>operating in northern Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take these Americans off the train,</v>

56
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.370
<v Speaker 1>line them up in front of the tracks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forced them to strip,</v>

57
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.290
<v Speaker 1>and then execute them.</v>

58
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 1>We know this because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans feigned death and got away and</v>

59
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:23.551
<v Speaker 1>told his story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe he said that the bodies were </v>

60
00:04:23.551 --> 00:04:26.311
<v Speaker 1>also mutilated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This very well may have been an attempt </v>

61
00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 1>to provoke a response on the part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>theU ,</v>

62
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 1>s government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if so,</v>

63
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 1>the mutilation is just part of adding </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuel to the fire,</v>

64
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.440
<v Speaker 1>a little something to make the US </v>
<v Speaker 1>government even angrier at this event </v>

65
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.790
<v Speaker 1>and things had been escalating to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in northern Mexico for some time </v>

66
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.030
<v Speaker 1>groups affiliated with these same gunman</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been attacking isolated Americans at</v>

67
00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here,</v>

68
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:47.170
<v Speaker 1>a murder there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rape here or there,</v>

69
00:04:47.171 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 1>but this was upping the ante </v>
<v Speaker 1>significantly.</v>

70
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the maneuver accomplished nothing </v>

71
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.940
<v Speaker 1>concrete of note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a couple of months later in March 19,</v>

72
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.030
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this group of gunmen or outlaws or </v>

73
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.601
<v Speaker 1>revolutionaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking at it from another </v>

74
00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:11.851
<v Speaker 1>point of view up the ante again and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cross the US Mexican border in strength </v>

75
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.950
<v Speaker 1>more than 100 go after American interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the US side of the border,</v>

76
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>culminating in that in an attack on a US</v>
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>

77
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Mexico.</v>

78
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 1>In the middle of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they roar through this town,</v>

79
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 1>shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looting,</v>

80
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 1>killing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and burning.</v>

81
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.660
<v Speaker 1>18 Americans will be killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The town will be burned down and the </v>

82
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.050
<v Speaker 1>bandits or terrorists or </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionaries,</v>

83
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:47.650
<v Speaker 1>depending on your point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will escape back into Mexico.</v>

84
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a side note,</v>

85
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:55.221
<v Speaker 1>then as now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans are heavily armed people and </v>

86
00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:56.540
<v Speaker 1>those bandits paid a high price for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

87
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.580
<v Speaker 1>what they did that town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many more of them died than Americans </v>

88
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

89
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.360
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you were safe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>protected within the confines of the US </v>

90
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:12.701
<v Speaker 1>borders was shattered in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't happened since the Apache wars in</v>

91
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 1>that region had ended 30 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>previously,</v>

92
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.140
<v Speaker 1>the attackers have Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Mexico.</v>

93
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:23.141
<v Speaker 1>We're affiliated with a Mexican </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary leader known to history,</v>

94
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:28.751
<v Speaker 1>not his actual name as Poncho via now </v>
<v Speaker 1>via almost certainly wasn't in Columbus,</v>

95
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.300
<v Speaker 1>New Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had been hurt not that long before,</v>

96
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.810
<v Speaker 1>but these gunman were part of his men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at this superficially,</v>

97
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of similarities between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Poncho via and Osama bin Ladin.</v>

98
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not said to insult Mexican folks</v>

99
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 1>who still in some cases revere Poncho </v>
<v Speaker 1>via his memory,</v>

100
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:57.821
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard to avoid that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least from the American side of </v>

101
00:06:57.821 --> 00:07:00.161
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are rough analogies that you can </v>

102
00:07:00.161 --> 00:07:00.560
<v Speaker 1>point to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

103
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.150
<v Speaker 1>like Bin Ladin via had once upon a time </v>
<v Speaker 1>been a friend,</v>

104
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:10.151
<v Speaker 1>did the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone we thought we could work with </v>

105
00:07:10.151 --> 00:07:12.520
<v Speaker 1>and use and an arm and train and help.</v>

106
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.530
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after that attack in Columbus,</v>

107
00:07:17.531 --> 00:07:20.950
<v Speaker 1>New Mexico when it was obvious that some</v>
<v Speaker 1>response had to be put together,</v>

108
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.370
<v Speaker 1>President Woodrow Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American leader,</v>

109
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
<v Speaker 1>launches and expedition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a military expedition into northern </v>

110
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sends about 5,000</v>

111
00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:35.740
<v Speaker 1>men across the border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a a,</v>

112
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.800
<v Speaker 1>an official leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't the guy who actually lead </v>

113
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:40.800
<v Speaker 1>things on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy who led things on the ground was</v>

114
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:45.580
<v Speaker 1>an American general named John pershing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was nicknamed by the way was Black </v>

115
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Jack and a year before to show you how </v>
<v Speaker 1>close the United States had been divya </v>

116
00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.250
<v Speaker 1>at one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the year before,</v>

117
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:58.330
<v Speaker 1>pershing launches this expedition to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>capture this terrorist Poncho via.</v>

118
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.990
<v Speaker 1>He loses his whole family in a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

119
00:08:01.991 --> 00:08:06.910
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pershing's wife and his little girls,</v>

120
00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:09.640
<v Speaker 1>they were little children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>died in the fire,</v>

121
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:15.690
<v Speaker 1>and as he was wallowing in almost soul </v>
<v Speaker 1>crushing grief amongst the condolence </v>

122
00:08:19.001 --> 00:08:24.001
<v Speaker 1>letters he received was one from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Poncho via person that he would be </v>

123
00:08:24.311 --> 00:08:29.311
<v Speaker 1>chasing about a year later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of interesting things </v>

124
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.940
<v Speaker 1>that this expedition across the border </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows,</v>

125
00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.740
<v Speaker 1>not just Mexicans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just Americans,</v>

126
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:42.130
<v Speaker 1>but European observers everywhere who </v>
<v Speaker 1>all throughout this war have wondered </v>

127
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.520
<v Speaker 1>what the United States is going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what their capabilities are.</v>

128
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.530
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden they have a US military </v>
<v Speaker 1>force in the field to have a look at and</v>

129
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 1>measure up against the standards of </v>
<v Speaker 1>early 20th century.</v>

130
00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.470
<v Speaker 1>And to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American endeavor looks like a </v>

131
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.470
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>

132
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:05.640
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look a whole lot different </v>
<v Speaker 1>than efforts 30 years ago to the year </v>

133
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.390
<v Speaker 1>that were launched to go after the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>Apache leader to,</v>

134
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:11.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>break off theU ,</v>

135
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:17.130
<v Speaker 1>s reservation system with 40 warriors </v>
<v Speaker 1>and go into some of this same country </v>

136
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:22.021
<v Speaker 1>that via and his men were hiding in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a very similar army.</v>

137
00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Just add some motor cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what the US military was </v>

138
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.161
<v Speaker 1>employing to give them some mobility and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some airplanes that look like they were </v>

139
00:09:32.161 --> 00:09:34.450
<v Speaker 1>invented by the Wright brothers </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

140
00:09:34.451 --> 00:09:37.420
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pilots were trained in some cases by</v>

141
00:09:37.421 --> 00:09:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Orville and Wilbur Wright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how recent,</v>

142
00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>airplane development is and the US </v>

143
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.460
<v Speaker 1>planes are so rickety and so new that </v>
<v Speaker 1>none of them survived the first week or </v>

144
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:52.201
<v Speaker 1>two of operation down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the more interesting aspects to </v>

145
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:59.370
<v Speaker 1>the US operations in northern Mexico to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go get Poncho via is the US doesn't know</v>

146
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:04.371
<v Speaker 1>northern Mexico in their maps are all </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong and so they have leading their </v>

147
00:10:04.371 --> 00:10:09.111
<v Speaker 1>army as scouts Apaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these Apache's include allegedly </v>

148
00:10:11.721 --> 00:10:16.721
<v Speaker 1>some Apache scouts who were amongst the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Apache Scouts that hunted down Geronimo </v>

149
00:10:17.301 --> 00:10:19.490
<v Speaker 1>30 years before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

150
00:10:19.491 --> 00:10:22.430
<v Speaker 1>there's quite a connection to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people involved in this conflict.</v>

151
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.740
<v Speaker 1>John General,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Black.</v>

152
00:10:24.741 --> 00:10:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Jack pershing was a junior officer </v>
<v Speaker 1>trailing Geronimo.</v>

153
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Thirty years before these events.</v>

154
00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:38.090
<v Speaker 1>It's believed that Poncho via wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get the US to attack northern Mexico and</v>

155
00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:43.791
<v Speaker 1>bog them down in this insane country to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight in insane terrain,</v>

156
00:10:44.131 --> 00:10:49.131
<v Speaker 1>insane weather conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thereby raise his standing amongst </v>

157
00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:54.231
<v Speaker 1>several revolutionary leaders vying for </v>
<v Speaker 1>control of the instability in Mexico </v>

158
00:10:55.981 --> 00:10:59.820
<v Speaker 1>that had been going on since the 1910 </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution began,</v>

159
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.660
<v Speaker 1>but if Europeans already had a stereo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typical view of the United States is a </v>

160
00:11:07.411 --> 00:11:12.411
<v Speaker 1>nation of cowboys and an army myered in </v>
<v Speaker 1>an almost old west sort of approach.</v>

161
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.160
<v Speaker 1>The expedition into northern Mexico to </v>
<v Speaker 1>capture Poncho via did nothing to </v>

162
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:24.081
<v Speaker 1>disabuse them of that stereotype to many</v>
<v Speaker 1>European observers.</v>

163
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.480
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just a frontier army that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States of America looked like </v>

164
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.161
<v Speaker 1>they possessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of a frontier mentality to </v>

165
00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:37.431
<v Speaker 1>go along with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that was really </v>

166
00:11:37.431 --> 00:11:38.670
<v Speaker 1>hard for European planners is that on </v>
<v Speaker 1>both sides of the war,</v>

167
00:11:38.671 --> 00:11:43.671
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it began to look more and more </v>

168
00:11:43.671 --> 00:11:43.800
<v Speaker 1>like the United States was going to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>this huge role in the war.</v>

169
00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.980
<v Speaker 1>But what did that even mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States had never sent over </v>

170
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.820
<v Speaker 1>lots of men to go fight in some European</v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

171
00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.640
<v Speaker 1>It was alien,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American experience,</v>

172
00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:59.641
<v Speaker 1>so would they actually do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were a lot of European observers </v>

173
00:11:59.641 --> 00:12:00.310
<v Speaker 1>that thought that even if the US got </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the war,</v>

174
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:03.340
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't send troops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans don't do that,</v>

175
00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.210
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of what makes that pre </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war.</v>

176
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.560
<v Speaker 1>United States of America hard for modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans to understand.</v>

177
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:14.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know your grandparents,</v>

178
00:12:14.571 --> 00:12:16.130
<v Speaker 1>if you're lucky enough to have met your </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandparents,</v>

179
00:12:16.131 --> 00:12:21.131
<v Speaker 1>you can explain them to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You begin to get a real feel for what </v>

180
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:25.481
<v Speaker 1>they're about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they're very different than you </v>

181
00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:25.481
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're real.</v>

182
00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:29.410
<v Speaker 1>You can relate to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States of 1916 is like a </v>

183
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:29.410
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

184
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.460
<v Speaker 1>great grandparents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can read all about it you want,</v>

185
00:12:31.461 --> 00:12:36.461
<v Speaker 1>but those people are different from you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't understand them and you </v>

186
00:12:36.461 --> 00:12:36.461
<v Speaker 1>never knew them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never knew anyone like them.</v>

187
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.800
<v Speaker 1>The modern United States of America is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most intervention is great power in </v>

188
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.450
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1916,</v>

189
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.960
<v Speaker 1>it was the opposite and it had a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology connected to its very founding</v>

190
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.990
<v Speaker 1>that reinforced the idea that that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way American foreign policy should be </v>

191
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:03.010
<v Speaker 1>before the United States could involve </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in the first world war.</v>

192
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:08.580
<v Speaker 1>It had to somehow deal with this lasting</v>
<v Speaker 1>legacy dating all the way back to,</v>

193
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pre-revolutionary days,</v>

194
00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:15.871
<v Speaker 1>but why don't you just start with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>farewell speech of the first American </v>

195
00:13:15.871 --> 00:13:16.480
<v Speaker 1>President,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Washington,</v>

196
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:22.610
<v Speaker 1>a speech that was re-read allowed once a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year in patriotic fervor,</v>

197
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.790
<v Speaker 1>a speech that told Americans to stay out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Europe's wars</v>

198
00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:35.260
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of his goodbye speech to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the American people in his resigning </v>

199
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:36.110
<v Speaker 1>from public life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

200
00:13:36.111 --> 00:13:41.111
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great rule of conduct for us in </v>

201
00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:45.791
<v Speaker 1>regard to foreign nations is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extending our commercial relations to </v>

202
00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:49.100
<v Speaker 1>have with them as little political </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection as possible.</v>

203
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.680
<v Speaker 1>So far as we've already formed </v>
<v Speaker 1>engagements,</v>

204
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.160
<v Speaker 1>let them be fulfilled with perfect good </v>
<v Speaker 1>faith here.</v>

205
00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Let us stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe has a set of primary interest,</v>

206
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.910
<v Speaker 1>which to us have none or very remote </v>
<v Speaker 1>relation.</v>

207
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Hence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she must be engaged in frequent </v>

208
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:09.200
<v Speaker 1>controversies that causes of which are </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially foreign to our concerns,</v>

209
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:14.500
<v Speaker 1>hence therefore it must be unwise in us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to implicate ourselves by artificial </v>

210
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:19.481
<v Speaker 1>ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics were the ordinary combinations </v>

211
00:14:19.551 --> 00:14:22.310
<v Speaker 1>in collisions of her friendships or </v>
<v Speaker 1>enmities.</v>

212
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Our detached and distance situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>invites and enables us to pursue a </v>

213
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.430
<v Speaker 1>different course if we remain one people</v>
<v Speaker 1>under inefficient government.</v>

214
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:36.790
<v Speaker 1>The period is not far off when we may </v>
<v Speaker 1>defy material injury from external </v>

215
00:14:36.801 --> 00:14:41.801
<v Speaker 1>annoyance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we may take such an attitude as </v>

216
00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:45.011
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause the neutrality we may at any time </v>

217
00:14:45.011 --> 00:14:47.390
<v Speaker 1>resolve upon to be scrupulously </v>
<v Speaker 1>respected when belligerent nations under</v>

218
00:14:47.391 --> 00:14:52.391
<v Speaker 1>the impossibility of making acquisitions</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon us will lightly hazard the giving </v>

219
00:14:52.761 --> 00:14:57.761
<v Speaker 1>us provocation which we may choose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peace or war as our interest guided by </v>

220
00:14:57.761 --> 00:15:02.421
<v Speaker 1>justice shall council.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar </v>

221
00:15:02.421 --> 00:15:07.221
<v Speaker 1>situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why quit our own to stand upon foreign </v>

222
00:15:07.221 --> 00:15:07.221
<v Speaker 1>ground?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

223
00:15:07.221 --> 00:15:12.200
<v Speaker 1>By interweaving our destiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would that have any part of Europe </v>

224
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.120
<v Speaker 1>entangle our peace and prosperity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the toils of European ambition,</v>

225
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.490
<v Speaker 1>rival ship interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humor,</v>

226
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:22.550
<v Speaker 1>or caprice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is our true policy to steer clear of </v>

227
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:26.091
<v Speaker 1>permanent alliances with any portion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the foreign world and quote,</v>

228
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:31.770
<v Speaker 1>when Americans revere those people like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Demi Gods and that speech has re-read to</v>

229
00:15:31.771 --> 00:15:34.440
<v Speaker 1>American school children and re-read </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly once a year.</v>

230
00:15:34.441 --> 00:15:38.310
<v Speaker 1>On the anniversary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that if you were an American</v>

231
00:15:38.311 --> 00:15:41.160
<v Speaker 1>who thought that the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>should enter the first world war,</v>

232
00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:46.440
<v Speaker 1>you have a lot of mythology to overcome </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of ingrained ideological training.</v>

233
00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Unless you think that those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary sentiments.</v>

234
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.330
<v Speaker 1>You know from the beginning of a nation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times people are very emotional</v>

235
00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:58.670
<v Speaker 1>and sentimental and lofty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>idealistic.</v>

236
00:15:58.671 --> 00:16:01.310
<v Speaker 1>When a nation is founded and that cools </v>
<v Speaker 1>over time.</v>

237
00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Forty five years after Washington gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>that speech,</v>

238
00:16:04.221 --> 00:16:06.260
<v Speaker 1>the current president of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

239
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:10.220
<v Speaker 1>a second generation guy like George w </v>
<v Speaker 1>dot Bush,</v>

240
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:15.240
<v Speaker 1>kind of John Quincy Adams gave another </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these foreign policy speeches,</v>

241
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.380
<v Speaker 1>coining a famous phrase that Americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>would use ever since going abroad in </v>

242
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:28.241
<v Speaker 1>search of monsters to slay the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>antithesis of the idea that the United </v>

243
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.400
<v Speaker 1>States government is going to use as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>slogan to get the United States into the</v>

244
00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:39.401
<v Speaker 1>first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Quincy Adams in the middle of one </v>

245
00:16:39.401 --> 00:16:40.190
<v Speaker 1>of his speech is dealing with what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country's foreign policy should be.</v>

246
00:16:40.191 --> 00:16:43.640
<v Speaker 1>Forty five years after Washington gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>his speech said,</v>

247
00:16:43.641 --> 00:16:46.670
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking about the United States here in</v>

248
00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:48.010
<v Speaker 1>the Feminine Pronoun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

249
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.720
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever standard of freedom and pendens</v>

250
00:16:51.721 --> 00:16:55.620
<v Speaker 1>has been or shall be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfurled there will her heart,</v>

251
00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.720
<v Speaker 1>her benedictions and her prayers be but </v>
<v Speaker 1>she goes not abroad in search of </v>

252
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.470
<v Speaker 1>monsters to destroy.</v>

253
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:04.950
<v Speaker 1>She is the well wisher to the freedom </v>
<v Speaker 1>and independence of all.</v>

254
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.920
<v Speaker 1>She's the champion and vindicator only </v>
<v Speaker 1>of her own.</v>

255
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:13.280
<v Speaker 1>She will recommend the general cause by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the countenance of her voice and the </v>

256
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.640
<v Speaker 1>sympathy of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Example,</v>

257
00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.880
<v Speaker 1>she well knows that by once enlisting </v>
<v Speaker 1>under other banners than her own were </v>

258
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.810
<v Speaker 1>they even the banners of foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>

259
00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:27.020
<v Speaker 1>She would involve herself beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 1>power of extrication in all the wars of </v>

260
00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:31.611
<v Speaker 1>interest and intrigue of individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>avarice and Vienna ambition which </v>

261
00:17:31.611 --> 00:17:34.210
<v Speaker 1>assumed the colors and you serve </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard of freedom.</v>

262
00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:39.050
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental maxims of her policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>would insensibly changed from liberty to</v>

263
00:17:39.051 --> 00:17:43.370
<v Speaker 1>force the front lead upon her brows </v>
<v Speaker 1>would no longer being with the ineffable</v>

264
00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:48.371
<v Speaker 1>splendor of freedom and independence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in its stead would soon be </v>

265
00:17:48.371 --> 00:17:52.001
<v Speaker 1>substituted and imperial diadem flashing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and false and tarnished luster.</v>

266
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.900
<v Speaker 1>The murky radiance of dominion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

267
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.480
<v Speaker 1>She might become the dictate trust of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

268
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.570
<v Speaker 1>She would be no longer the ruler of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>own spirit.</v>

269
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.800
<v Speaker 1>And to quote this kind of historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>legacy of idealism,</v>

270
00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:08.250
<v Speaker 1>this mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>

271
00:18:08.251 --> 00:18:10.950
<v Speaker 1>that Americans had reinforced all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

272
00:18:10.951 --> 00:18:15.951
<v Speaker 1>provided a natural counterweight for </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriots to choose a side that seemed to</v>

273
00:18:16.441 --> 00:18:21.390
<v Speaker 1>be opposite of what patriotism normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>implied in Europe.</v>

274
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Patriotism was a key part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalism.</v>

275
00:18:23.971 --> 00:18:28.971
<v Speaker 1>It's the grabbing of the flag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'm pushing your nation's </v>

276
00:18:28.971 --> 00:18:28.971
<v Speaker 1>glory and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

277
00:18:28.971 --> 00:18:33.260
<v Speaker 1>and borders farther that was true in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States to everybody's human.</v>

278
00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:35.370
<v Speaker 1>The same sorts of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

279
00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.660
<v Speaker 1>rallying cries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often work on Americans that work on </v>

280
00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:42.891
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also had this refuge for people </v>

281
00:18:42.891 --> 00:18:46.161
<v Speaker 1>who were patriotic and who could take an</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti intervention is position and couch </v>

282
00:18:46.261 --> 00:18:50.310
<v Speaker 1>it as much in the flag as those who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggesting that real patriots,</v>

283
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:55.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joined up and fought the Spanish in </v>

284
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Cuba.</v>

285
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:55.830
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Theodore Roosevelt,</v>

286
00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:01.310
<v Speaker 1>the former president of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States in and volunteer for that Spanish</v>

287
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.400
<v Speaker 1>American war know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept taking the opposite viewpoint that </v>

288
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.041
<v Speaker 1>the United States of America lived in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different time than those founding </v>

289
00:19:10.041 --> 00:19:12.540
<v Speaker 1>fathers and that real patriotism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>real men would be ready to join.</v>

290
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:17.541
<v Speaker 1>The first world war in the United States</v>
<v Speaker 1>is looking like a coward by not being </v>

291
00:19:17.541 --> 00:19:21.930
<v Speaker 1>involved with theater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt is not the president in 1916,</v>

292
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:26.070
<v Speaker 1>but he's needling the guy who is a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the other party,</v>

293
00:19:26.071 --> 00:19:31.071
<v Speaker 1>a Democrat named Woodrow Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most enigmatic and hard to </v>

294
00:19:31.591 --> 00:19:34.920
<v Speaker 1>get your mind around figures in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

295
00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:41.210
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that Wilson is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to figure out is because the </v>

296
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.991
<v Speaker 1>historians don't agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority of historians have always </v>

297
00:19:44.991 --> 00:19:48.921
<v Speaker 1>taken Wilson sort of at face value and </v>
<v Speaker 1>portray him as one of the most,</v>

298
00:19:49.621 --> 00:19:52.650
<v Speaker 1>if not the most idealistic president in </v>
<v Speaker 1>American history.</v>

299
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.640
<v Speaker 1>A guy who is so peace loving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's virtually gone ds and a man who did</v>

300
00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:04.491
<v Speaker 1>everything he could to keep the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States out of war and to fight for this </v>

301
00:20:04.491 --> 00:20:08.730
<v Speaker 1>wonderful just fair piece afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the sort of the the goodwills and</v>

302
00:20:08.731 --> 00:20:13.731
<v Speaker 1>I divided them into the goodwill Wilson </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Evil Woodrow Wilson in terms of </v>

303
00:20:13.731 --> 00:20:15.180
<v Speaker 1>how some historians see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other historical campus,</v>

304
00:20:15.181 --> 00:20:18.030
<v Speaker 1>smaller but very vociferous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very loud and growing.</v>

305
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.940
<v Speaker 1>And those are the people who for a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of domestic reasons,</v>

306
00:20:20.941 --> 00:20:23.220
<v Speaker 1>it should be pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like Woodrow Wilson at all.</v>

307
00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.500
<v Speaker 1>And often you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scribe,</v>

308
00:20:25.501 --> 00:20:30.000
<v Speaker 1>sinister or venal motives for him doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he was doing.</v>

309
00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:35.570
<v Speaker 1>And see a man who wanted to get involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the allies who sought piece for his</v>

310
00:20:36.331 --> 00:20:41.331
<v Speaker 1>own vainglorious reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a schemer and a person who hid </v>

311
00:20:42.661 --> 00:20:46.440
<v Speaker 1>behind a mask that promised you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>idealism and peace,</v>

312
00:20:46.441 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 1>and there were German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

313
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.820
<v Speaker 1>who were never falling for that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Wilson was some Bambi,</v>

314
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:56.821
<v Speaker 1>deer in the headlights on the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage and always thought that that was </v>

315
00:20:56.821 --> 00:21:00.331
<v Speaker 1>just a really good mask that his </v>
<v Speaker 1>machiavellian scheming hid behind making</v>

316
00:21:00.611 --> 00:21:01.720
<v Speaker 1>him even more dangerous.</v>

317
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>His disguise was better.</v>

318
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to wait as a fan of </v>

319
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:09.330
<v Speaker 1>history into which Wilson I believe was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the real Wilson,</v>

320
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.950
<v Speaker 1>but look at how it adds to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty of the whole thing.</v>

321
00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:17.100
<v Speaker 1>What is this guy all about now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I personally think that the air of </v>

322
00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:22.300
<v Speaker 1>mystery that surrounds Woodrow Wilson </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes him a more interesting character.</v>

323
00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:27.301
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a giant enigma that's quickly </v>

324
00:21:27.301 --> 00:21:29.911
<v Speaker 1>becoming perhaps the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>single individual in the story by the </v>

325
00:21:29.911 --> 00:21:31.840
<v Speaker 1>end of 1916.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

326
00:21:31.841 --> 00:21:35.290
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to live with them to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in this tale.</v>

327
00:21:35.291 --> 00:21:37.930
<v Speaker 1>He's not a character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a world leader.</v>

328
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:42.220
<v Speaker 1>And what the United States does in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>war might decide the conflict.</v>

329
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:47.430
<v Speaker 1>So the stakes couldn't be higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Winston Churchill writing after the </v>

330
00:21:47.591 --> 00:21:52.591
<v Speaker 1>first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got a very interesting view on </v>

331
00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:52.591
<v Speaker 1>Wilson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to describe.</v>

332
00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:52.591
<v Speaker 1>You can see he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

333
00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:55.990
<v Speaker 1>He's walking on eggshells sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he says this guy,</v>

334
00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.520
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know anything about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

335
00:21:57.521 --> 00:22:00.580
<v Speaker 1>he comes out of academia basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he says,</v>

336
00:22:00.581 --> 00:22:05.581
<v Speaker 1>only in the American system do you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that can come from totally </v>

337
00:22:05.581 --> 00:22:07.330
<v Speaker 1>outside politics as complete unknowns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

338
00:22:07.331 --> 00:22:12.331
<v Speaker 1>in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a prime minister would have spent </v>

339
00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:14.911
<v Speaker 1>years in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the House of Commons or what have </v>

340
00:22:14.911 --> 00:22:14.911
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

341
00:22:14.911 --> 00:22:17.971
<v Speaker 1>working their way up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would be in the public eye the </v>

342
00:22:17.971 --> 00:22:19.861
<v Speaker 1>whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would be a known quantity by the </v>

343
00:22:19.861 --> 00:22:21.871
<v Speaker 1>time they got the top job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He marvels at the fact that Woodrow </v>

344
00:22:21.871 --> 00:22:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Wilson is an unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

345
00:22:22.961 --> 00:22:27.961
<v Speaker 1>the most powerful man in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States and quickly becoming the most </v>

346
00:22:28.001 --> 00:22:33.001
<v Speaker 1>important single figure in the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill writes about Wilson in all his</v>

347
00:22:33.881 --> 00:22:36.940
<v Speaker 1>strength and his weakness in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobility,</v>

348
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
<v Speaker 1>in his foibles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in spite of his long academic </v>

349
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.391
<v Speaker 1>record and brief governorship and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown and unmeasured quantity to the </v>

350
00:22:45.391 --> 00:22:46.540
<v Speaker 1>mighty people who made him their ruler.</v>

351
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:50.020
<v Speaker 1>In 1912,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still more was he a mystery to the world</v>

352
00:22:50.021 --> 00:22:52.630
<v Speaker 1>at large writing with every sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect,</v>

353
00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:57.780
<v Speaker 1>it seems no exaggeration to pronounce </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the action of the United States </v>

354
00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:02.010
<v Speaker 1>with its repercussions on the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world depended during the awful </v>

355
00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:06.211
<v Speaker 1>period of armageddon upon the workings </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this man's mind and spirit to the </v>

356
00:23:06.211 --> 00:23:10.240
<v Speaker 1>exclusion of almost every other factor </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that he played a part in the fate of</v>

357
00:23:10.241 --> 00:23:15.241
<v Speaker 1>nations in comparatively more direct and</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal than any other man and quote.</v>

358
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:20.860
<v Speaker 1>That's why we're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States so much in this episode,</v>

359
00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:26.910
<v Speaker 1>and one of the other parts of the Wilson</v>
<v Speaker 1>story that are interesting is when you </v>

360
00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.230
<v Speaker 1>get human beings in positions of great </v>
<v Speaker 1>power and authority,</v>

361
00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.680
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes their little quirks or </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiosyncrasies or characteristics can </v>

362
00:23:36.251 --> 00:23:39.130
<v Speaker 1>make or break history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

363
00:23:39.131 --> 00:23:42.970
<v Speaker 1>we all have little things about us that </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be quirky or idiosyncratic,</v>

364
00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.620
<v Speaker 1>but because we're not in positions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>and authority,</v>

365
00:23:45.621 --> 00:23:47.150
<v Speaker 1>they don't really make much of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

366
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:52.150
<v Speaker 1>If if adults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler leaves the military after the </v>

367
00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:55.481
<v Speaker 1>first world war is a decorated corporal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and goes and opens up a sausage shop in </v>

368
00:23:55.481 --> 00:24:00.071
<v Speaker 1>Munich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his quirks and idiosyncrasies and </v>

369
00:24:00.071 --> 00:24:01.580
<v Speaker 1>characteristics don't make a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference on the world stage.</v>

370
00:24:01.581 --> 00:24:03.740
<v Speaker 1>You probably never hear about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They only affect,</v>

371
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:08.980
<v Speaker 1>you know the people he has contact with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you take that same figure and you </v>

372
00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:13.151
<v Speaker 1>make them the iron fisted dictator of </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the Great Twentieth Century </v>

373
00:24:13.151 --> 00:24:17.501
<v Speaker 1>nations on the planet and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden that man's quirks and </v>

374
00:24:17.501 --> 00:24:19.940
<v Speaker 1>idiosyncrasies and characteristics can </v>
<v Speaker 1>create a deadly holocaust.</v>

375
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilson didn't have those kinds of </v>

376
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.001
<v Speaker 1>characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least I haven't heard that even from </v>

377
00:24:28.001 --> 00:24:30.491
<v Speaker 1>the evil Wilson camp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he did have characteristics that </v>

378
00:24:30.491 --> 00:24:33.491
<v Speaker 1>impacted this whole situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was he was almost always convinced </v>

379
00:24:33.491 --> 00:24:36.230
<v Speaker 1>that he was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No paraphrasing here,</v>

380
00:24:36.231 --> 00:24:41.231
<v Speaker 1>but he said something to the effect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>once that he felt pity for people who </v>

381
00:24:41.231 --> 00:24:42.260
<v Speaker 1>had different opinions than him because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew they were wrong.</v>

382
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:47.770
<v Speaker 1>You can watch the way he operates in </v>
<v Speaker 1>government and he's a supremely gifted </v>

383
00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:51.731
<v Speaker 1>politician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of times those people are </v>

384
00:24:51.731 --> 00:24:55.211
<v Speaker 1>unwilling to let other men carry out </v>
<v Speaker 1>their policies and their programs </v>

385
00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:01.570
<v Speaker 1>because they know they could do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>better and you can see that from Wilson </v>

386
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.391
<v Speaker 1>to after the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man is going to become the British </v>

387
00:25:04.391 --> 00:25:05.090
<v Speaker 1>prime minister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy named David Lloyd.</v>

388
00:25:05.091 --> 00:25:10.091
<v Speaker 1>George will have to sit by the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>military leader on one side and the </v>

389
00:25:10.091 --> 00:25:14.981
<v Speaker 1>president of the United States on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and he said it was like sitting </v>

390
00:25:14.981 --> 00:25:18.011
<v Speaker 1>between Napoleon on one side and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the French leader and Jesus on the </v>

391
00:25:18.011 --> 00:25:22.631
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was woodrow Wilson and Jesus was </v>

392
00:25:22.631 --> 00:25:26.921
<v Speaker 1>probably more the way Wilson saw himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what George was trying to convey than</v>

393
00:25:27.921 --> 00:25:32.921
<v Speaker 1>the way others saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Negotiating with a savior can require a </v>

394
00:25:34.191 --> 00:25:39.191
<v Speaker 1>deft touch and Wilson's demeanor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of professorial air of superiority </v>

395
00:25:41.901 --> 00:25:43.310
<v Speaker 1>and that I'm always right.</v>

396
00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:48.640
<v Speaker 1>Kind of save your air about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes rubbed some people the wrong </v>

397
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.970
<v Speaker 1>way and certainly influenced the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Wilson handled things.</v>

398
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:58.300
<v Speaker 1>And there were several big challenges to</v>
<v Speaker 1>American neutrality that Wilson had to </v>

399
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.790
<v Speaker 1>deal with and all we're especially acute</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1916.</v>

400
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:07.810
<v Speaker 1>One involved American lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other involved American money and </v>

401
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:12.251
<v Speaker 1>the last involved in American election </v>
<v Speaker 1>start with perhaps the number one most </v>

402
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:18.670
<v Speaker 1>obvious things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sucking the United States into the </v>

403
00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:19.220
<v Speaker 1>whirlpool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vortex of the first world war.</v>

404
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:24.520
<v Speaker 1>And it was something that was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously doing that you can feel the </v>

405
00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:28.661
<v Speaker 1>momentum even now reading the history </v>
<v Speaker 1>books about this sort of slide into a </v>

406
00:26:28.661 --> 00:26:32.630
<v Speaker 1>war because the German's use of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly modern science fiction almost</v>

407
00:26:32.631 --> 00:26:37.631
<v Speaker 1>weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The submarine and the submarine was </v>

408
00:26:37.631 --> 00:26:38.780
<v Speaker 1>creating conditions where a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans here and there,</v>

409
00:26:38.781 --> 00:26:42.200
<v Speaker 1>every now and then we're dying on ships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then.</v>

410
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.790
<v Speaker 1>It was worse than when the Lusitania </v>
<v Speaker 1>went down,</v>

411
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:49.980
<v Speaker 1>which was a titanic like liner to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>submarine torpedo.</v>

412
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:52.530
<v Speaker 1>More than 100 Americans went down with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that ship.</v>

413
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.280
<v Speaker 1>How long would any nation put up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

414
00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.010
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is is that the US would </v>
<v Speaker 1>complain.</v>

415
00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.680
<v Speaker 1>It works something out with the Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tensions would drop.</v>

416
00:27:01.681 --> 00:27:03.600
<v Speaker 1>And then a month later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>month and a half later,</v>

417
00:27:03.601 --> 00:27:04.710
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens again.</v>

418
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:10.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like a sore that kept getting poked</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a needle before it was able to heal</v>

419
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:15.510
<v Speaker 1>and yet we'll send,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept making the conditions more and more</v>

420
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:20.960
<v Speaker 1>impossible to fulfill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those anti wilsonian historians who </v>

421
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:20.960
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

422
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.480
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you misunderstand.</v>

423
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:26.481
<v Speaker 1>Wilson was trying to create the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions that the Germans couldn't </v>

424
00:27:26.481 --> 00:27:29.451
<v Speaker 1>help but violate and then get the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States into the war and then claim it </v>

425
00:27:29.451 --> 00:27:31.020
<v Speaker 1>was foist upon the Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

426
00:27:31.021 --> 00:27:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Wilson at one point in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration with high minded rhetoric</v>

427
00:27:35.011 --> 00:27:40.011
<v Speaker 1>and speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was defending the right of an American </v>

428
00:27:40.011 --> 00:27:40.011
<v Speaker 1>passenger.</v>

429
00:27:40.011 --> 00:27:43.800
<v Speaker 1>And remember Americans could travel on </v>
<v Speaker 1>American ships or neutral ships and and,</v>

430
00:27:43.801 --> 00:27:48.801
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at certain times the German's had </v>

431
00:27:48.801 --> 00:27:49.110
<v Speaker 1>had sworn they wouldn't go after those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Wilson was defending the right of an</v>

432
00:27:49.111 --> 00:27:53.340
<v Speaker 1>American to travel on a British ship or </v>
<v Speaker 1>a French ship,</v>

433
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:58.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A belligerent ship and defending their </v>

434
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.371
<v Speaker 1>right to travel on a belligerent ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it was carrying munitions and </v>

435
00:28:01.651 --> 00:28:05.520
<v Speaker 1>defending their right to travel on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>belligerent ship carrying munitions that</v>

436
00:28:05.521 --> 00:28:09.060
<v Speaker 1>also was carrying defensive guns on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could hurt a submarine.</v>

437
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:14.790
<v Speaker 1>That's when the Germans would throw up </v>
<v Speaker 1>their hands and say that to them.</v>

438
00:28:14.791 --> 00:28:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Wilson didn't look like an honest </v>
<v Speaker 1>broker.</v>

439
00:28:16.891 --> 00:28:19.230
<v Speaker 1>That's the kind of guy you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trust with peace.</v>

440
00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:20.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

441
00:28:20.521 --> 00:28:25.521
<v Speaker 1>he did and their attitude was he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold the British to any of these same </v>

442
00:28:25.521 --> 00:28:25.980
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to hold us to.</v>

443
00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.650
<v Speaker 1>The British had a blockade going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't use submarines.</v>

444
00:28:28.651 --> 00:28:33.651
<v Speaker 1>They use minds and they would mind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>North Sea and they create these zones </v>

445
00:28:33.651 --> 00:28:34.770
<v Speaker 1>where they would stop every line that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could get their hands on,</v>

446
00:28:34.771 --> 00:28:37.080
<v Speaker 1>make it go to a British port,</v>
<v Speaker 1>search it,</v>

447
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:42.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided was contraband and Wilson and </v>

448
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:42.810
<v Speaker 1>his administration were pretty darn </v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet about that.</v>

449
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.900
<v Speaker 1>The occasional protest and nothing more </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Germans.</v>

450
00:28:45.901 --> 00:28:49.590
<v Speaker 1>This looked like rank hypocrisy and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>anti wilsonian historians.</v>

451
00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:54.710
<v Speaker 1>To them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a perfect example to show </v>

452
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:58.070
<v Speaker 1>that really these ideals that Wilson </v>
<v Speaker 1>professed were very conveniently ignored</v>

453
00:28:58.741 --> 00:29:03.741
<v Speaker 1>when they ran against what he wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were other complications that </v>

454
00:29:04.141 --> 00:29:08.540
<v Speaker 1>affected what he wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One had to do with perhaps the,</v>

455
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:12.750
<v Speaker 1>the most ancient of motivations of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic ones.</v>

456
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:19.030
<v Speaker 1>The United States was making a killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the first world war by 1916,</v>

457
00:29:19.071 --> 00:29:24.071
<v Speaker 1>pardon the pun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it began to affect its entire </v>

458
00:29:24.201 --> 00:29:29.201
<v Speaker 1>outlook toward the conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the longest term impacts,</v>

459
00:29:30.391 --> 00:29:32.790
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the first world war that the results</v>

460
00:29:32.791 --> 00:29:34.980
<v Speaker 1>of which we live with everyday in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern world,</v>

461
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.260
<v Speaker 1>but it's sort of sinks beneath the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radar.</v>

462
00:29:37.261 --> 00:29:42.261
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot easier to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>submarine warfare question than it is </v>

463
00:29:42.261 --> 00:29:45.250
<v Speaker 1>the economic transfer of wealth from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe to the United States.</v>

464
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:51.730
<v Speaker 1>This war was so total in its stakes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

465
00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:56.780
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sides fighting it found no good </v>

466
00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:57.490
<v Speaker 1>reason not to spend every bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital.</v>

467
00:29:57.491 --> 00:29:58.600
<v Speaker 1>They had to win it.</v>

468
00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:05.290
<v Speaker 1>When Britain started this war in 1914,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was the richest country in the </v>

469
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:08.681
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not long after the era where the </v>

470
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:09.890
<v Speaker 1>phrase the sun never sets on the British</v>
<v Speaker 1>empire was in vogue.</v>

471
00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:15.400
<v Speaker 1>The British empire controlled directly </v>
<v Speaker 1>or indirectly about a third of the </v>

472
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:19.271
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was wealthy and she'd been sucking </v>

473
00:30:19.271 --> 00:30:19.760
<v Speaker 1>up a lot of the wealth of Europe for 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

474
00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:24.560
<v Speaker 1>During Europe's most dominant time </v>
<v Speaker 1>period on the world stage.</v>

475
00:30:24.561 --> 00:30:29.561
<v Speaker 1>The era of colonies and Post Napoleonic </v>
<v Speaker 1>splendor,</v>

476
00:30:29.901 --> 00:30:31.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Victorian Age,</v>

477
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:34.220
<v Speaker 1>and yet when 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 started,</v>

478
00:30:34.221 --> 00:30:39.221
<v Speaker 1>the British didn't just have their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>bills to pay in this most expensive of </v>

479
00:30:39.221 --> 00:30:40.010
<v Speaker 1>all human conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They underwrote their dominions.</v>

480
00:30:40.011 --> 00:30:42.050
<v Speaker 1>The Canada's the Australia is the New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zealand's.</v>

481
00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:47.350
<v Speaker 1>They underwrote countries like Italy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid for almost all their costs during </v>

482
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.690
<v Speaker 1>the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Russians to it.</v>

483
00:30:47.691 --> 00:30:50.810
<v Speaker 1>A lot of other small powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amounts of money that we're changing</v>

484
00:30:50.811 --> 00:30:51.080
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

485
00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.990
<v Speaker 1>I've seen so many different attempts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with it.</v>

486
00:30:53.991 --> 00:30:56.420
<v Speaker 1>All you have to know though is it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ungodly.</v>

487
00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:02.140
<v Speaker 1>At one point it was like $75,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars a week in 1916.</v>

488
00:31:03.411 --> 00:31:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

489
00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:09.520
<v Speaker 1>it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wealth transfer and when Britain </v>

490
00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:09.520
<v Speaker 1>started buying stuff from places like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>

491
00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.320
<v Speaker 1>when the war started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used cash and gold.</v>

492
00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:17.890
<v Speaker 1>By 1916.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about credit and debt and </v>

493
00:31:17.991 --> 00:31:22.991
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to think of New York as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being like a giant vacuum cleaner with </v>

494
00:31:22.991 --> 00:31:26.831
<v Speaker 1>the sucking hose and in London just </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucking out a hundred years of </v>

495
00:31:26.831 --> 00:31:31.151
<v Speaker 1>civilizational wealth acquirement it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a bad image in four years.</v>

496
00:31:33.561 --> 00:31:38.561
<v Speaker 1>The center of world banking as we sit in</v>
<v Speaker 1>an earlier episode is transferred from </v>

497
00:31:38.561 --> 00:31:43.061
<v Speaker 1>London to New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing for the center of World </v>

498
00:31:43.061 --> 00:31:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden by 1916,</v>

499
00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Wilson is acquiring a huge amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power because the United States is the </v>

500
00:31:51.311 --> 00:31:54.670
<v Speaker 1>banker and these people are beginning to</v>
<v Speaker 1>owe it money.</v>

501
00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.460
<v Speaker 1>The British realized that at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

502
00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.340
<v Speaker 1>historian justice don't key rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

503
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:07.310
<v Speaker 1>about Wilson's new ability because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>controls the purse strings of the allied</v>

504
00:32:08.011 --> 00:32:11.880
<v Speaker 1>side in this war to dictate any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome he might want.</v>

505
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.260
<v Speaker 1>He writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

506
00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:18.250
<v Speaker 1>if Wilson desire to force the allies to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the peace table,</v>

507
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.850
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity had come and he knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On October third,</v>

508
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:26.910
<v Speaker 1>1916,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a British interdepartmental conference </v>

509
00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:28.990
<v Speaker 1>noted the nation's utter dependence upon</v>
<v Speaker 1>American munitions,</v>

510
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:30.790
<v Speaker 1>steel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foodstuffs,</v>

511
00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:31.930
<v Speaker 1>oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wheat,</v>

512
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:33.580
<v Speaker 1>cotton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lubricants.</v>

513
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.090
<v Speaker 1>We're the United States to engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic reprisals.</v>

514
00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Britain's war effort would practically </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the 5 million pounds sterling needed </v>

515
00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:47.111
<v Speaker 1>to prosecute the war reported a </v>
<v Speaker 1>government economist John Maynard </v>

516
00:32:47.111 --> 00:32:47.450
<v Speaker 1>Keynes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Later that week,</v>

517
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:52.570
<v Speaker 1>2 million must come from North America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote in a few months time claimed the </v>

518
00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:57.341
<v Speaker 1>treasury official,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American public will be in a </v>

519
00:32:57.341 --> 00:33:00.011
<v Speaker 1>position to dictate to this country on </v>
<v Speaker 1>matters that affect us more nearly than </v>

520
00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:00.500
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And quote,</v>

521
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.500
<v Speaker 1>the author continues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote Reginald Mckenna,</v>

522
00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Chancellor of the Exchequer concurred </v>
<v Speaker 1>with canes telling the cabinet.</v>

523
00:33:07.491 --> 00:33:11.120
<v Speaker 1>In late October quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by next June or earlier,</v>

524
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:16.360
<v Speaker 1>the president of the American republic </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be in a position if he wishes to </v>

525
00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.950
<v Speaker 1>dictate his own terms to us and quote.</v>

526
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.000
<v Speaker 1>The author says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of December,</v>

527
00:33:20.001 --> 00:33:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Mckenna told an American journalist that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilson could quote,</v>

528
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:26.660
<v Speaker 1>force the allies to their knees anytime </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a moment.</v>

529
00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:32.610
<v Speaker 1>And quote the United States in late 1916</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like a bank in Europe and especially </v>

530
00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Great Britain who was the financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>underwriter of the whole allied war </v>

531
00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.941
<v Speaker 1>effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically owes is the bank money that </v>

532
00:33:42.941 --> 00:33:46.271
<v Speaker 1>gives the bank a lot of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's an old line in banking that </v>

533
00:33:47.031 --> 00:33:48.830
<v Speaker 1>if you owe the bank a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

534
00:33:48.831 --> 00:33:52.220
<v Speaker 1>it's the bank who has the power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you owe a bank a lot of money,</v>

535
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:57.730
<v Speaker 1>that power goes back to the person that </v>
<v Speaker 1>owes the money because the bank now has </v>

536
00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:01.841
<v Speaker 1>a vested interest in seeing that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>person survives so that they can pay </v>

537
00:34:01.841 --> 00:34:05.831
<v Speaker 1>them back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States is beginning to worry </v>

538
00:34:05.831 --> 00:34:09.020
<v Speaker 1>about what happens if we can't sell this</v>
<v Speaker 1>war material anymore,</v>

539
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.750
<v Speaker 1>or if we can't get paid for the credit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're loaning out.</v>

540
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:18.040
<v Speaker 1>The US has had a very uncomfortable sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of prosperity descend on it in the past </v>

541
00:34:18.621 --> 00:34:23.621
<v Speaker 1>two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1914 when the first world war breaks </v>

542
00:34:23.621 --> 00:34:26.801
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American economy is not doing well </v>

543
00:34:26.801 --> 00:34:26.801
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By 1916,</v>

544
00:34:26.801 --> 00:34:31.240
<v Speaker 1>halfway through the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American economy is humming along </v>

545
00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:31.240
<v Speaker 1>nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

546
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Some historians have actually called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States a nation of war </v>

547
00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:36.800
<v Speaker 1>profiteers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>

548
00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:41.920
<v Speaker 1>if if Wilson was successful in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in creating a negotiated peace at the </v>

549
00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.640
<v Speaker 1>end of 1916 somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you wanted it at that point,</v>

550
00:34:43.641 --> 00:34:46.490
<v Speaker 1>declare the winner in the first world </v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

551
00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you know which two powers I'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>nominate it nominate Japan and the </v>

552
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:54.590
<v Speaker 1>United States and the Japanese hardly </v>
<v Speaker 1>fought in the war at all.</v>

553
00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:59.680
<v Speaker 1>And by the end of 1916,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States hadn't fought in the </v>

554
00:34:59.680 --> 00:34:59.750
<v Speaker 1>war at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the victors.</v>

555
00:34:59.751 --> 00:35:04.220
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese get involved in 1914 for </v>
<v Speaker 1>purely opportunistic reasons.</v>

556
00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:09.460
<v Speaker 1>They can take over all the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>holdings in their neck of the woods and </v>

557
00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:09.460
<v Speaker 1>the Germans can't do anything.</v>

558
00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.510
<v Speaker 1>So you get all this territory for </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically nothing.</v>

559
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:17.210
<v Speaker 1>The United States is selling stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing amounts of stuff.</v>

560
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:21.170
<v Speaker 1>The both sides need everything in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Americans will sell to anybody,</v>

561
00:35:21.171 --> 00:35:23.090
<v Speaker 1>but they can't get their stuff to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>

562
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:25.520
<v Speaker 1>They still made loans and tried to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff to them.</v>

563
00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.220
<v Speaker 1>But by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British blockade had shut that down,</v>

564
00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:30.350
<v Speaker 1>but you could still trade with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British.</v>

565
00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:35.380
<v Speaker 1>And we did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that that trade might </v>

566
00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:40.361
<v Speaker 1>somehow go away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>began to filter into the halls of </v>

567
00:35:40.361 --> 00:35:41.760
<v Speaker 1>government the prosperity that this war </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought.</v>

568
00:35:41.761 --> 00:35:44.460
<v Speaker 1>The United States created another vested</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>

569
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:48.610
<v Speaker 1>And there are economic historians and </v>
<v Speaker 1>historians who look more at,</v>

570
00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:53.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic motivations for why countries </v>

571
00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:56.091
<v Speaker 1>do things that pointed this as the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important undercurrent of why the war </v>

572
00:35:56.091 --> 00:35:58.650
<v Speaker 1>was really going the way it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

573
00:35:58.651 --> 00:36:01.260
<v Speaker 1>there's another reason too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a very pedestrian,</v>

574
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:06.830
<v Speaker 1>but woodrow Wilson in 1916 was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>American president that faced an </v>

575
00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.840
<v Speaker 1>election campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where the,</v>

576
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:15.230
<v Speaker 1>the real uniqueness of the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation has demonstrated what does the</v>

577
00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:18.990
<v Speaker 1>president do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's running for reelection,</v>

578
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:24.260
<v Speaker 1>and the big elephant in the living room </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation is this war in Europe when </v>

579
00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:27.240
<v Speaker 1>he's facing an electorate made up of </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants,</v>

580
00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.860
<v Speaker 1>of people on both sides of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>

581
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:36.860
<v Speaker 1>In the old world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>historian David Stevenson does a great </v>

582
00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.390
<v Speaker 1>job breaking down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

583
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.900
<v Speaker 1>the ethnic makeup of the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>and showing you all these weird problems</v>

584
00:36:42.901 --> 00:36:47.901
<v Speaker 1>that the United States would have if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>got into this conflict that other </v>

585
00:36:47.901 --> 00:36:48.240
<v Speaker 1>nations wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

586
00:36:48.241 --> 00:36:53.241
<v Speaker 1>he points out that large chunks of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States is made up of immigrants </v>

587
00:36:53.241 --> 00:36:55.470
<v Speaker 1>from some of these countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two main groups that are,</v>

588
00:36:55.471 --> 00:37:00.471
<v Speaker 1>that are problematic for anyone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to talk about siding with the </v>

589
00:37:00.471 --> 00:37:04.881
<v Speaker 1>allies in this first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our German Americans and Irish </v>

590
00:37:04.881 --> 00:37:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what Stevenson writes,</v>

591
00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:11.540
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>support for American neutrality was </v>

592
00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.421
<v Speaker 1>strongest in the interior and especially</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle West where the German </v>

593
00:37:14.421 --> 00:37:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Americans were concentrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of whom only an insignificant minority </v>

594
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.140
<v Speaker 1>favored intervention on the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>central powers of a US population.</v>

595
00:37:22.141 --> 00:37:25.020
<v Speaker 1>In 1910 of $92 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he writes,</v>

596
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:29.400
<v Speaker 1>two and a half million had been born in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany and five point seven,</v>

597
00:37:29.401 --> 00:37:33.960
<v Speaker 1>$8 million had one or two German born </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents in 1917,</v>

598
00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:36.660
<v Speaker 1>522 German language.</v>

599
00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Newspapers and journals were published </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States.</v>

600
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:43.320
<v Speaker 1>And German Americans were the largest </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic group in Baltimore,</v>

601
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Pittsburgh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>

602
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Detroit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles,</v>

603
00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:48.990
<v Speaker 1>and San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And quote,</v>

604
00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:53.400
<v Speaker 1>he then goes on to talk about Irish </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans who,</v>

605
00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:58.460
<v Speaker 1>and we didn't even get into this as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a person of partly Irish American </v>

606
00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.770
<v Speaker 1>descent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have just gone off on,</v>

607
00:38:00.771 --> 00:38:01.770
<v Speaker 1>on the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

608
00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Irish uprising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Easter uprising that happened,</v>

609
00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:10.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during this conflict of which the </v>

610
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Germans may have had a role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

611
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.600
<v Speaker 1>the British considered this an </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially nasty stab in the bank back </v>

612
00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:19.111
<v Speaker 1>since it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During wartime reacted by killing a lot </v>

613
00:38:19.111 --> 00:38:19.350
<v Speaker 1>of Irish or it depends on if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>British or not,</v>

614
00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:24.500
<v Speaker 1>killing Irish leaders in the uprising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infuriating a Americans of Irish </v>

615
00:38:25.531 --> 00:38:27.120
<v Speaker 1>descent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of which there were a ton,</v>

616
00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:29.430
<v Speaker 1>and so if you're a politician like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Woodrow Wilson,</v>

617
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:34.730
<v Speaker 1>you have to deal with the fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a ton of voters who were the only </v>

618
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:37.870
<v Speaker 1>people that can keep you in power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are really interested in not joining</v>

619
00:38:37.871 --> 00:38:40.690
<v Speaker 1>the side of the allies maybe or anyone.</v>

620
00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:46.560
<v Speaker 1>The slogan for the Nineteen 16 campaign </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's most remembered on the Woodrow </v>

621
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.640
<v Speaker 1>Wilson side is the one that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

622
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:53.970
<v Speaker 1>he kept us out of war and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a slogan that appealed to most </v>

623
00:38:55.601 --> 00:39:00.601
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilson's peace oriented Secretary of </v>

624
00:39:00.601 --> 00:39:01.270
<v Speaker 1>State,</v>
<v Speaker 1>William Jennings.</v>

625
00:39:01.271 --> 00:39:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Bryan had said at one point that New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York and the major newspapers want war.</v>

626
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:11.260
<v Speaker 1>The rest of the country wants peace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're an American planner,</v>

627
00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:16.500
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting how many times you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>open up the history books and see </v>

628
00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.711
<v Speaker 1>references to the uncertainty of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>these large immigrant descendant </v>

629
00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:24.880
<v Speaker 1>populations would do if the US joined </v>
<v Speaker 1>the allied side in the war.</v>

630
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:28.480
<v Speaker 1>If you have two point $5,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million Americans born in Germany,</v>

631
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:33.840
<v Speaker 1>what are they going to do when war </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks out or these potential </v>

632
00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.691
<v Speaker 1>terrorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it became quite an interesting </v>

633
00:39:36.691 --> 00:39:40.021
<v Speaker 1>issue before the conflict involved the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States as to whether or not the </v>

634
00:39:40.021 --> 00:39:44.940
<v Speaker 1>United States was unified and the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would go fight on any side in </v>

635
00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:44.940
<v Speaker 1>this conflict.</v>

636
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.130
<v Speaker 1>Now what do you do if you're one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these American figures,</v>

637
00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:53.370
<v Speaker 1>perhaps one of the top politicians who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants the United States to get into the </v>

638
00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:57.811
<v Speaker 1>first world war?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your strategy for dealing with </v>

639
00:39:57.811 --> 00:40:00.550
<v Speaker 1>these Americans who don't want to go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Want to stay neutral?</v>

640
00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.360
<v Speaker 1>It may be a huge majority of the country</v>
<v Speaker 1>during this time period.</v>

641
00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:09.690
<v Speaker 1>If you're a politician and you're used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sort of putting your finger in the </v>

642
00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:09.970
<v Speaker 1>wind and going in the direction that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to go,</v>

643
00:40:09.971 --> 00:40:12.490
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want to go in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction you want to go.</v>

644
00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:17.820
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your strategy for dealing with </v>

645
00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.771
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The strategy of several of the top </v>

646
00:40:19.771 --> 00:40:22.501
<v Speaker 1>political figures in this period was to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play the Super Patriot card and to </v>

647
00:40:22.501 --> 00:40:26.821
<v Speaker 1>accuse Americans who disagreed with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of getting into the war as being </v>

648
00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:30.700
<v Speaker 1>disloyal mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take for example,</v>

649
00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:34.420
<v Speaker 1>the former president Theodore Roosevelt </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1916.</v>

650
00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt is not running for president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's campaigning and helping the guy</v>

651
00:40:39.461 --> 00:40:42.340
<v Speaker 1>who is from his own party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republican that's challenging.</v>

652
00:40:42.341 --> 00:40:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Woodrow Wilson in the November 1916 </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections.</v>

653
00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt is in an interesting position </v>

654
00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:53.611
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He desperately wants to get into the </v>

655
00:40:53.611 --> 00:40:56.131
<v Speaker 1>first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks it's cowardly that the US is </v>

656
00:40:56.131 --> 00:40:59.101
<v Speaker 1>staying out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has publicly slamming Woodrow Wilson </v>

657
00:40:59.101 --> 00:41:00.670
<v Speaker 1>from pillar to post for not wanting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get involved in the conflict.</v>

658
00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.630
<v Speaker 1>He compares him on the campaign trail to</v>
<v Speaker 1>punch US pilot.</v>

659
00:41:04.631 --> 00:41:09.631
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says Wilson's neutrality is worse </v>

660
00:41:09.631 --> 00:41:09.631
<v Speaker 1>than ponchos pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember Pontius pilot?</v>

661
00:41:09.631 --> 00:41:14.490
<v Speaker 1>He's the Roman official who in the Bible</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sentences Jesus to be crucified.</v>

662
00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:18.760
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty good political slam at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the president,</v>

663
00:41:18.761 --> 00:41:23.761
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then Roosevelt makes a point to go </v>

664
00:41:23.761 --> 00:41:26.230
<v Speaker 1>after what at the time were referred to </v>
<v Speaker 1>as hyphenated Americans.</v>

665
00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:31.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who had a hyphen between their </v>

666
00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:32.470
<v Speaker 1>description of their nationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>German hyphen Americans,</v>

667
00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:37.100
<v Speaker 1>Irish Hyphen Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish Hyphen Americans,</v>

668
00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:42.230
<v Speaker 1>and there was a feeling amongst a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans that these people weren't real</v>

669
00:41:42.231 --> 00:41:47.231
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they had conflicted loyalties and </v>

670
00:41:47.231 --> 00:41:50.681
<v Speaker 1>there was also this idea that you had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have 100 percent loyalty to the United </v>

671
00:41:50.681 --> 00:41:55.300
<v Speaker 1>States and any consideration with what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ancestral home might want was </v>

672
00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.550
<v Speaker 1>equivalent in Roosevelt's own words to </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a moral trader.</v>

673
00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:04.980
<v Speaker 1>And so how do you deal with the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you want the United States to do </v>

674
00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:05.430
<v Speaker 1>something that most Americans don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to?</v>

675
00:42:05.431 --> 00:42:10.431
<v Speaker 1>Do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Slam as traitorous those who oppose </v>

676
00:42:10.431 --> 00:42:14.061
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Wilson was in a bit of a different </v>

677
00:42:14.061 --> 00:42:15.140
<v Speaker 1>position because not only many </v>
<v Speaker 1>historians think,</v>

678
00:42:15.141 --> 00:42:16.970
<v Speaker 1>did he not want to get in the war?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

679
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:20.840
<v Speaker 1>but he certainly had a public persona of</v>
<v Speaker 1>not wanting to get into the war,</v>

680
00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.830
<v Speaker 1>but Wilson didn't like anyone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreed with them.</v>

681
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:31.190
<v Speaker 1>And you can see Wilson's attitude about </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who would oppose his policies even</v>

682
00:42:31.501 --> 00:42:36.501
<v Speaker 1>in peace time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his response to a telegram he </v>

683
00:42:36.501 --> 00:42:37.920
<v Speaker 1>received from an Irish American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that hyphenation,</v>

684
00:42:37.921 --> 00:42:39.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Irish hyphened,</v>

685
00:42:39.091 --> 00:42:41.870
<v Speaker 1>American leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In September 19,</v>

686
00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:45.120
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy named Jeremiah O'leary and o'leary</v>

687
00:42:45.121 --> 00:42:48.150
<v Speaker 1>was telling Wilson something that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's perfectly logical.</v>

688
00:42:48.151 --> 00:42:53.151
<v Speaker 1>He's explaining to him that all of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>moves that seem to lean toward the </v>

689
00:42:53.151 --> 00:42:54.660
<v Speaker 1>allied side of the war are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues in the campaign,</v>

690
00:42:54.661 --> 00:42:59.661
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing controversial about </v>

691
00:42:59.661 --> 00:42:59.661
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>O'Leary's cable said,</v>

692
00:42:59.661 --> 00:43:02.601
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your foreign policy is your failure to </v>

693
00:43:02.601 --> 00:43:03.720
<v Speaker 1>secure compliance with all American </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

694
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:08.040
<v Speaker 1>You're leaning and see with the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>Empire your approval of war loans.</v>

695
00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:12.180
<v Speaker 1>The ammunition traffic are issues in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this campaign and quote,</v>

696
00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:15.360
<v Speaker 1>most American political figures would </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that.</v>

697
00:43:15.361 --> 00:43:20.361
<v Speaker 1>That's just someone from the opposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining that that's how the American </v>

698
00:43:20.361 --> 00:43:20.550
<v Speaker 1>political system works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with that,</v>

699
00:43:20.551 --> 00:43:25.020
<v Speaker 1>especially not in peace time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilson wrote back to Jeremiah O'leary,</v>

700
00:43:25.021 --> 00:43:27.510
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your telegram received.</v>

701
00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:32.720
<v Speaker 1>I would feel deeply mortified to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>you or anybody like you vote for me </v>

702
00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:36.630
<v Speaker 1>since you have access to many disloyal </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans and I have not.</v>

703
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:40.780
<v Speaker 1>I will ask you to convey this message to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and quote.</v>

704
00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:46.760
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to simply oppose Woodrow Wilson's </v>

705
00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:49.890
<v Speaker 1>policies in peace time doesn't make you </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the loyal opposition.</v>

706
00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:55.220
<v Speaker 1>It makes you disloyal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is a president who feels that peace</v>

707
00:43:55.611 --> 00:43:58.830
<v Speaker 1>time opposition to peacetime policies is</v>
<v Speaker 1>disloyal?</v>

708
00:43:58.831 --> 00:44:02.670
<v Speaker 1>What's a guy like that going to do when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no longer peace time?</v>

709
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a little preview to think about.</v>

710
00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:11.300
<v Speaker 1>We still have laws on the books that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were currently enforcing and using in </v>

711
00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.781
<v Speaker 1>the war on terror that our president </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilson's response to critics who </v>

712
00:44:15.061 --> 00:44:20.061
<v Speaker 1>addressed him negatively in war time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you think that this is an </v>

713
00:44:21.261 --> 00:44:23.660
<v Speaker 1>overreaction though or maybe misplaced</v>

714
00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:28.690
<v Speaker 1>priorities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth noticing that in late 1916,</v>

715
00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:34.080
<v Speaker 1>there are several belligerence in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are most threatened not by foreign </v>

716
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:37.770
<v Speaker 1>armies defeating their armies on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battlefield,</v>

717
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:43.430
<v Speaker 1>but by their own populations collapsing </v>
<v Speaker 1>from within morally or in terms of their</v>

718
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:49.700
<v Speaker 1>unity and support for the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In an era where more and more of the </v>

719
00:44:50.761 --> 00:44:55.761
<v Speaker 1>armies of these modern 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 1>states could take a punch and stay on </v>

720
00:44:55.761 --> 00:44:57.450
<v Speaker 1>the battlefield fighting year after </v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

721
00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:02.960
<v Speaker 1>the Chink in the national armor for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these states was proving to be the </v>

722
00:45:03.241 --> 00:45:08.241
<v Speaker 1>home front and nowhere by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you see a better example of the </v>

723
00:45:08.821 --> 00:45:13.821
<v Speaker 1>sweeping away of the 19th century </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentality than in how the Home Front is </v>

724
00:45:13.831 --> 00:45:18.831
<v Speaker 1>viewed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Home Front of course as a shorthand </v>

725
00:45:18.831 --> 00:45:19.750
<v Speaker 1>word for the people back living their </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilian lives and you know,</v>

726
00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.430
<v Speaker 1>supporting the war economy and helping </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make munitions and all the stuff that</v>

727
00:45:23.431 --> 00:45:25.170
<v Speaker 1>helps support those troops at the front.</v>

728
00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:30.120
<v Speaker 1>In the 19th century in Europe's more </v>
<v Speaker 1>genteel sort of era,</v>

729
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:35.390
<v Speaker 1>there were all sorts of peace </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventions and laws of war meetings to </v>

730
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:37.500
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help spare civilians and keep them as</v>

731
00:45:37.501 --> 00:45:39.720
<v Speaker 1>far away from the suffering of war as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

732
00:45:39.721 --> 00:45:42.120
<v Speaker 1>That was considered to be a civilization</v>
<v Speaker 1>will advance.</v>

733
00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:48.350
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting and and telling I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>to watch that sort of genteel peace time</v>

734
00:45:49.051 --> 00:45:54.051
<v Speaker 1>mentality crash into the rocks of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality that are the 20th century where </v>

735
00:45:54.751 --> 00:45:58.800
<v Speaker 1>all of those rules look like rainbows </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Unicorns.</v>

736
00:45:58.801 --> 00:46:02.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean from another time we're gassing </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other with know insecticide,</v>

737
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:07.230
<v Speaker 1>human humic decide can we say that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>design something you use to spray on </v>

738
00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:08.940
<v Speaker 1>human beings like their aunts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

739
00:46:08.941 --> 00:46:13.941
<v Speaker 1>there go the 19th century genteel </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventions right there and the same </v>

740
00:46:13.941 --> 00:46:14.810
<v Speaker 1>applied to civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the Germans,</v>

741
00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:18.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using zipline raids to drop bombs on,</v>

742
00:46:18.111 --> 00:46:19.560
<v Speaker 1>on British cities.</v>

743
00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:24.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean there goes those 19th century </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventions right there and the German </v>

744
00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:24.560
<v Speaker 1>bombers who do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

745
00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.370
<v Speaker 1>site this idea that everyone's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>combatant.</v>

746
00:46:26.371 --> 00:46:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Now if the home front is a legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>target in total war,</v>

747
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:34.800
<v Speaker 1>then so are the civilians going about </v>
<v Speaker 1>their daily lives in places like Germany</v>

748
00:46:34.801 --> 00:46:35.670
<v Speaker 1>and Austria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungary.</v>

749
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.190
<v Speaker 1>When the British cut off trade to those </v>
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>

750
00:46:38.191 --> 00:46:43.191
<v Speaker 1>they begin to do the equivalent of put </v>
<v Speaker 1>an entire nation or an entire alliance </v>

751
00:46:45.631 --> 00:46:49.140
<v Speaker 1>under siege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one British official actually said,</v>

752
00:46:49.141 --> 00:46:51.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference between,</v>

753
00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:53.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting the city under siege,</v>

754
00:46:53.071 --> 00:46:55.920
<v Speaker 1>which has been done throughout history </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the civilian population in that,</v>

755
00:46:55.921 --> 00:46:59.430
<v Speaker 1>besides that he always suffers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting a nation under siege.</v>

756
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:05.600
<v Speaker 1>The British clamped down this blockade </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of the war by the </v>

757
00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:08.901
<v Speaker 1>middle and latter parts of Nineteen </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixteen at Longterm Anaconda like </v>

758
00:47:08.901 --> 00:47:10.470
<v Speaker 1>strategy really begins to bite.</v>

759
00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:16.610
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason why is these </v>
<v Speaker 1>societies are already straining to the </v>

760
00:47:16.681 --> 00:47:20.550
<v Speaker 1>maximum to just keep their militaries in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the field.</v>

761
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:25.670
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's easy to forget exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the strain on these societies,</v>

762
00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was because you look at,</v>

763
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:32.630
<v Speaker 1>we know we've often compared the size of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these modern armies to what Alexander </v>

764
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:34.030
<v Speaker 1>the great conquered the known world with</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in,</v>

765
00:47:34.031 --> 00:47:36.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the three thirties bce.</v>

766
00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Alexander the Great is a core in one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these modern armies.</v>

767
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Listen to what a German army corps of </v>
<v Speaker 1>which they had dozens in the army </v>

768
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:51.840
<v Speaker 1>requires to sustain itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine an ancient economy trying to </v>

769
00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.630
<v Speaker 1>provide this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is from a holder,</v>

770
00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:58.400
<v Speaker 1>her vague and his book on the First </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War quote,</v>

771
00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:02.650
<v Speaker 1>the army consumed copious amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>food and fodder,</v>

772
00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:07.890
<v Speaker 1>a single core of 35,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers monthly devoured 1 million </v>

773
00:48:08.831 --> 00:48:11.350
<v Speaker 1>pounds of meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>600,000</v>

774
00:48:11.351 --> 00:48:14.290
<v Speaker 1>loaves of bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>189,000</v>

775
00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:17.680
<v Speaker 1>pounds of fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or he says 242,000</v>

776
00:48:17.681 --> 00:48:21.640
<v Speaker 1>pounds of canned meat and 121,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds of Marmalade.</v>

777
00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:24.790
<v Speaker 1>And he says 73,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds of coffee.</v>

778
00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:30.090
<v Speaker 1>It's horses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her Irving says needed 7 million pounds </v>

779
00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:31.540
<v Speaker 1>of oats and more than 4 million pounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Hay.</v>

780
00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:34.120
<v Speaker 1>The 18th army corps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

781
00:48:34.121 --> 00:48:39.121
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>estimated that it needed 1000 wagons </v>

782
00:48:39.121 --> 00:48:41.680
<v Speaker 1>extending for nine miles to haul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's monthly allotment of bread.</v>

783
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:45.280
<v Speaker 1>It's butchers slaughter at 1,320</v>
<v Speaker 1>cows.</v>

784
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:49.000
<v Speaker 1>1,100</v>
<v Speaker 1>hogs and 4,158</v>

785
00:48:49.001 --> 00:48:51.430
<v Speaker 1>sheep every month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taken as a whole.</v>

786
00:48:51.431 --> 00:48:55.640
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German army weekly demolished $60,</v>

787
00:48:55.650 --> 00:49:00.650
<v Speaker 1>million pounds of bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>131 million pounds of potatoes and 17 </v>

788
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:06.390
<v Speaker 1>million pounds of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one in the government or the general </v>

789
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:07.630
<v Speaker 1>staff he writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had given serious considerations to such</v>

790
00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:12.560
<v Speaker 1>mammoth needs for a period of four years</v>
<v Speaker 1>and quote no,</v>

791
00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.730
<v Speaker 1>no one saw that coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone from the ancient world,</v>

792
00:49:15.731 --> 00:49:19.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean this could never have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustained before the modern era,</v>

793
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:24.540
<v Speaker 1>but sustaining it took all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary foodstuffs out of the civilian</v>

794
00:49:26.921 --> 00:49:31.770
<v Speaker 1>populations mouths and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to starve because of it.</v>

795
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:38.670
<v Speaker 1>The winter of 1916,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1917 will be remembered by Germans </v>

796
00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:42.781
<v Speaker 1>forever as the turnip winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the winter where the hunger </v>

797
00:49:42.781 --> 00:49:47.410
<v Speaker 1>blockade really bit historian Eric Dorn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burroughs writes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we are all gaunt and bony.</v>

805
00:50:07.871 --> 00:50:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have dark shadows around our eyes and</v>

806
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:14.590
<v Speaker 1>our thoughts are chiefly taken up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering where our next meal will be.</v>

807
00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Bros continues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote poor had almost disappeared from </v>

808
00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:21.640
<v Speaker 1>dinner tables in restaurants where crow </v>
<v Speaker 1>was now served,</v>

809
00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:24.910
<v Speaker 1>milk was reserved almost exclusively for</v>
<v Speaker 1>young children,</v>

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:28.340
<v Speaker 1>butter and sugar could be purchased only</v>
<v Speaker 1>in very small quantities.</v>

811
00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:33.590

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:38.081
<v Speaker 1>begun to replace potatoes and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bros goes into a couple of reminisces </v>

813
00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:41.960
<v Speaker 1>from Germans about what those tasted </v>
<v Speaker 1>like and then says,</v>

814
00:50:41.961 --> 00:50:43.790
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitably,</v>

815
00:50:43.791 --> 00:50:48.791
<v Speaker 1>as nutrition levels fell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies to come to a variety of ailments </v>

816
00:50:48.791 --> 00:50:49.130
<v Speaker 1>like rickets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scurvy,</v>

817
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:51.140
<v Speaker 1>dysentery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tuberculosis,</v>

818
00:50:51.141 --> 00:50:56.141
<v Speaker 1>and influenza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Estimates place the number of blockade </v>

819
00:50:56.141 --> 00:50:59.321
<v Speaker 1>related deaths by war's end at 730,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes popular outrage,</v>

820
00:51:00.051 --> 00:51:01.960
<v Speaker 1>understandable and quote.</v>

821
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as with everything in the first world </v>

822
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.430
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are historical dissenters who will</v>

823
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:13.151
<v Speaker 1>challenge every aspect of what's known </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the hunger blockade affecting the </v>

824
00:51:13.151 --> 00:51:14.780
<v Speaker 1>central powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But nonetheless,</v>

825
00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:16.910
<v Speaker 1>the important thing to understand is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it.</v>

826
00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:21.960
<v Speaker 1>It creates a dynamic in this conflict </v>
<v Speaker 1>that forces the German side to do </v>

827
00:51:23.181 --> 00:51:28.181
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones continually getting </v>

828
00:51:28.181 --> 00:51:29.840
<v Speaker 1>less food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their adversaries,</v>

829
00:51:29.841 --> 00:51:33.140
<v Speaker 1>the British and the French do not have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>food insecurity problem.</v>

830
00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:38.740
<v Speaker 1>That dynamic forces the Germans to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to change their situation or </v>

831
00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:39.200
<v Speaker 1>they'll just strangled to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

832
00:51:39.201 --> 00:51:43.400
<v Speaker 1>if you're already living through what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans are calling the turnip winter in</v>

833
00:51:43.401 --> 00:51:47.690
<v Speaker 1>1916 and 1917,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they gonna call the next winter</v>

834
00:51:47.691 --> 00:51:52.691
<v Speaker 1>of 1917 and 1918.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be a genius to see </v>

835
00:51:52.691 --> 00:51:56.090
<v Speaker 1>that you now have to do something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change the state of affairs.</v>

836
00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:01.180
<v Speaker 1>German public opinion begins to demand </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

837
00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Now I should point out that that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much makes them the equal of all </v>

838
00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.381
<v Speaker 1>the other populations of all the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>belligerent seemingly doesn't seem like </v>

839
00:52:10.391 --> 00:52:14.500
<v Speaker 1>anyone's particularly happy with the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>their government is prosecuting the war,</v>

840
00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:17.050
<v Speaker 1>regardless of which country you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

841
00:52:17.051 --> 00:52:22.051
<v Speaker 1>at least amongst the major states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Britain at the end of 1916,</v>

842
00:52:22.741 --> 00:52:27.741
<v Speaker 1>there government falls and the new prime</v>
<v Speaker 1>minister who arises is the very </v>

843
00:52:28.541 --> 00:52:33.541
<v Speaker 1>embodiment of what voters would vote for</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they wanted to shake things up and </v>

844
00:52:33.541 --> 00:52:35.890
<v Speaker 1>get somebody different in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name is David Lloyd.</v>

845
00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:39.120
<v Speaker 1>George usually just called Lloyd George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Georgia.</v>

846
00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Feisty Welshman have a much more working</v>
<v Speaker 1>class background than you normally see </v>

847
00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:47.170
<v Speaker 1>in these sorts of positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might be exactly what you know,</v>

848
00:52:47.171 --> 00:52:50.890
<v Speaker 1>the average dissatisfied with the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>the war is going British citizen wanted.</v>

849
00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:57.300
<v Speaker 1>Now it is a little interesting that only</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of weeks before Lloyd George </v>

850
00:52:57.300 --> 00:53:00.991
<v Speaker 1>gets the job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's recorded as having said about the </v>

851
00:53:00.991 --> 00:53:04.651
<v Speaker 1>allies in Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've lost this war and now he's in </v>

852
00:53:05.291 --> 00:53:10.291
<v Speaker 1>charge of Britain's war effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also interesting to note that you </v>

853
00:53:10.291 --> 00:53:12.070
<v Speaker 1>could tell how up in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the outcome of the first world war is in</v>

854
00:53:12.071 --> 00:53:17.071
<v Speaker 1>1916,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can find leading figures on </v>

855
00:53:17.071 --> 00:53:18.070
<v Speaker 1>both sides who think their side has lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war.</v>

856
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French also get into the game.</v>

857
00:53:22.451 --> 00:53:27.451
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 16 has been a terrible year for</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to just as it has been for the </v>

858
00:53:27.451 --> 00:53:29.820
<v Speaker 1>British,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they finally find the courage to get</v>

859
00:53:29.821 --> 00:53:33.920
<v Speaker 1>rid of their longtime military leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the legend Joseph Jaffra.</v>

860
00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:38.700
<v Speaker 1>He's been living off the fumes of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>reputation from the battle of the Marne.</v>

861
00:53:38.701 --> 00:53:43.701
<v Speaker 1>A long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's safe to say been </v>

862
00:53:43.701 --> 00:53:43.701
<v Speaker 1>underperforming and the French finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't fire him.</v>

863
00:53:43.701 --> 00:53:48.651
<v Speaker 1>He's too much of a legend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they finally sort of kick him </v>

864
00:53:48.651 --> 00:53:50.400
<v Speaker 1>upstairs and promote them to a ceremony </v>
<v Speaker 1>of poster and replace him with the first</v>

865
00:53:50.401 --> 00:53:55.401
<v Speaker 1>new French leader since the war started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy named and he's Al the Russian </v>

866
00:53:55.981 --> 00:53:59.280
<v Speaker 1>population and public opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't really supposed to have much</v>

867
00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:01.940
<v Speaker 1>of a sway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly because they live in a,</v>

868
00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:05.670
<v Speaker 1>in a strange sort of autocracy with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>part time legislature,</v>

869
00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:10.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're making their feelings known </v>

870
00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:10.930
<v Speaker 1>to more on that in a minute.</v>

871
00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:15.140
<v Speaker 1>And in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the population just wants a way out of </v>

872
00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:18.981
<v Speaker 1>this trap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people would like to see efforts </v>

873
00:54:18.981 --> 00:54:20.430
<v Speaker 1>made towards figuring out a way out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the war,</v>

874
00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:24.660
<v Speaker 1>which they have people who say this in </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the belligerent countries,</v>

875
00:54:24.661 --> 00:54:29.661
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little while ago we talked about </v>

876
00:54:29.661 --> 00:54:32.541
<v Speaker 1>Woodrow Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggesting that people who might oppose </v>

877
00:54:32.541 --> 00:54:36.141
<v Speaker 1>his policies were disloyal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could get you thrown in the jails in </v>

878
00:54:36.141 --> 00:54:38.430
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these belligerent countries if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you appear to be disloyal.</v>

879
00:54:38.431 --> 00:54:41.070
<v Speaker 1>So too much peace talk could get you in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of trouble.</v>

880
00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a body of German public </v>

881
00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:46.310
<v Speaker 1>opinion that was pushing for another </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>

882
00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:49.170
<v Speaker 1>They wanted their government to take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gloves off,</v>

883
00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:55.050
<v Speaker 1>stop playing nice with the adversary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted their government to unleash </v>

884
00:54:56.971 --> 00:55:01.530
<v Speaker 1>the submarines and to heck with what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans would do to some Germans.</v>

885
00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:06.530
<v Speaker 1>The American policy looked to be a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>conniving way to simply deny Germany the</v>

886
00:55:06.931 --> 00:55:09.540
<v Speaker 1>use of the submarines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you make the rules too restrictive,</v>

887
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:14.630
<v Speaker 1>and in the Americans case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rule basically was that an American </v>

888
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:17.760
<v Speaker 1>traveling on some ship gives it some </v>
<v Speaker 1>magical protection simply by stepping on</v>

889
00:55:17.761 --> 00:55:18.840
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't sink that ship.</v>

890
00:55:18.841 --> 00:55:23.841
<v Speaker 1>Now there's an American on it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much nullifies the submarine for </v>

891
00:55:23.841 --> 00:55:27.981
<v Speaker 1>Germany at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if that's the only way you see a </v>

892
00:55:27.981 --> 00:55:30.360
<v Speaker 1>chance to end the war with the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>victory over the British,</v>

893
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:35.630
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you let the Americans hamstring you </v>

894
00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:36.810
<v Speaker 1>like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Added that.</v>

895
00:55:36.811 --> 00:55:41.811
<v Speaker 1>The fact that a lot of Germans don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really see the Americans is all that </v>

896
00:55:41.811 --> 00:55:43.530
<v Speaker 1>neutral already and think that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain could be defeated in four or six</v>

897
00:55:43.531 --> 00:55:46.020
<v Speaker 1>months before the Americans have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance to do much of anything.</v>

898
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Add to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that when public opinion veers </v>

899
00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:56.021
<v Speaker 1>in that direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are Germans in the military high </v>

900
00:55:56.021 --> 00:55:59.141
<v Speaker 1>command,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a majority of them that were already </v>

901
00:55:59.141 --> 00:56:00.941
<v Speaker 1>thinking that themselves now they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>public opinion on their side unleashed </v>

902
00:56:00.941 --> 00:56:04.241
<v Speaker 1>the submarines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if the Americans come in the </v>

903
00:56:04.241 --> 00:56:04.241
<v Speaker 1>war?</v>

904
00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:09.190
<v Speaker 1>There were German leaders though that </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't like this choice,</v>

905
00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:13.460
<v Speaker 1>wanted to find another option rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than use the subs,</v>

906
00:56:13.461 --> 00:56:18.461
<v Speaker 1>get the United States into the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chief among them was the chancellor of </v>

907
00:56:18.461 --> 00:56:19.730
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top political guy.</v>

908
00:56:19.731 --> 00:56:21.080
<v Speaker 1>His name was Beth manhole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vague,</v>

909
00:56:21.081 --> 00:56:23.830
<v Speaker 1>and we've discussed him before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all,</v>

910
00:56:23.831 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 1>by the</v>

911
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.090
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very controversial,</v>

912
00:56:25.091 --> 00:56:26.740
<v Speaker 3>very complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very convoluted.</v>

913
00:56:26.741 --> 00:56:29.380
<v Speaker 3>You're getting the Dan Carlin a </v>
<v Speaker 3>condensed,</v>

914
00:56:29.381 --> 00:56:34.381
<v Speaker 3>potentially unreliable version of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a fascinating time in the </v>

915
00:56:34.381 --> 00:56:39.001
<v Speaker 3>conflict because the politicians led by </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole vig think they find a way to throw</v>

916
00:56:39.821 --> 00:56:44.821
<v Speaker 3>a monkey wrench into that terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>choice that the allies of sort of </v>

917
00:56:44.821 --> 00:56:46.450
<v Speaker 3>foisted the Germans on with the hunger </v>
<v Speaker 3>blockade and everything else.</v>

918
00:56:46.451 --> 00:56:50.710
<v Speaker 3>They've got to make a move so they make </v>
<v Speaker 3>a very unexpected one.</v>

919
00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.170
<v Speaker 3>On December twelfth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>1916,</v>

920
00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:58.440
<v Speaker 3>Beth manhole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vague and the Germans announced that </v>

921
00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:03.030
<v Speaker 3>they are prepared to enter into </v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiations to end the war.</v>

922
00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:11.550
<v Speaker 3>Now it should be pointed out that such </v>
<v Speaker 3>calls for peace and discussions about </v>

923
00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:15.841
<v Speaker 3>peace had gone on since the war started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woodrow Wilson had stepped up pretty </v>

924
00:57:15.841 --> 00:57:18.250
<v Speaker 3>much right at the beginning and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll mediate anytime you want.</v>

925
00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:23.380
<v Speaker 3>There were attempts by both sides in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>war to try to make a separate peace with</v>

926
00:57:23.381 --> 00:57:24.990
<v Speaker 3>somebody else and maybe get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

927
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.580
<v Speaker 3>one of the allies of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your enemy to drop out of the war,</v>

928
00:57:27.581 --> 00:57:30.730
<v Speaker 3>but those are peace terms just to get an</v>
<v Speaker 3>edge in the conflict.</v>

929
00:57:30.731 --> 00:57:35.731
<v Speaker 3>They're not peace terms to end the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Germans were making the first </v>

930
00:57:35.731 --> 00:57:39.600
<v Speaker 3>apparently serious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly public offer to sit down and </v>

931
00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:42.370
<v Speaker 3>start talking about the issues that kept</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conflict going.</v>

932
00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:48.660
<v Speaker 3>This was a huge shock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not exactly to the Wilson </v>

933
00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:51.460
<v Speaker 3>Administration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd been getting some information fed</v>

934
00:57:51.461 --> 00:57:54.100
<v Speaker 3>through some back channels that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Germans might be ready to do this,</v>

935
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:59.430
<v Speaker 3>but the Americans thought that they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to unleash this big piece </v>

936
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.430
<v Speaker 3>proposal.</v>

937
00:57:59.430 --> 00:58:03.360
<v Speaker 3>When the Germans do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they preempt woodrow Wilson's version </v>

938
00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:03.360
<v Speaker 3>and he has to rush this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

939
00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.950
<v Speaker 3>about a week later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit miffed that the Germans </v>

940
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:09.100
<v Speaker 3>stole his thunder a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all of a sudden in December 19,</v>

941
00:58:09.101 --> 00:58:14.101
<v Speaker 3>16 after this horrible year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were a piece proposals on the </v>

942
00:58:14.101 --> 00:58:16.330
<v Speaker 3>table and it puts everybody into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really uncomfortable position.</v>

943
00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.810
<v Speaker 3>Now the Germans had taken a real chance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

944
00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:24.370
<v Speaker 3>by trying this peace proposal route.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If this is a high stakes card game and I</v>

945
00:58:24.371 --> 00:58:26.320
<v Speaker 3>often think of the war and in terms like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

946
00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:31.620
<v Speaker 3>the Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the hunger blockade and </v>

947
00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:33.511
<v Speaker 3>everything else are forced to play a </v>
<v Speaker 3>card and everyone thinks they're going </v>

948
00:58:33.511 --> 00:58:33.511
<v Speaker 3>to play that really high risk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high reward,</v>

949
00:58:33.511 --> 00:58:37.951
<v Speaker 3>dangerous card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have the unrestricted submarine </v>

950
00:58:37.951 --> 00:58:41.101
<v Speaker 3>warfare card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead they play a potentially equally </v>

951
00:58:41.101 --> 00:58:42.730
<v Speaker 3>perilous card,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one that no one's expecting.</v>

952
00:58:42.731 --> 00:58:47.731
<v Speaker 3>They play the race card,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the peace card can blow up in your </v>

953
00:58:47.731 --> 00:58:47.731
<v Speaker 3>face if you don't play it.</v>

954
00:58:47.731 --> 00:58:50.610
<v Speaker 3>Definitely case in point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are your enemy's gonna?</v>

955
00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you become the first power to come </v>

956
00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:55.620
<v Speaker 3>forward and start talking about stopping</v>
<v Speaker 3>the war,</v>

957
00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.670
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think you need to.</v>

958
00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:00.220
<v Speaker 3>What's more?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a danger.</v>

959
00:59:00.221 --> 00:59:05.221
<v Speaker 3>Your own people might think that too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you spend a lot of effort in this </v>

960
00:59:05.221 --> 00:59:06.850
<v Speaker 3>war to stiffen their backbone and keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>their resolve in place.</v>

961
00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:12.240
<v Speaker 3>How much are you going to undercut it if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you become the first power to seek </v>

962
00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:15.181
<v Speaker 3>peace?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this whole thing has to be worded </v>

963
00:59:15.181 --> 00:59:18.781
<v Speaker 3>very carefully and it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but almost in such a way to give your </v>

964
00:59:20.020 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 3>gift to give you as you're moving</v>

965
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:27.070
<v Speaker 1>your neck between the humanitarian side </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the German chancellors proposals and </v>

966
00:59:27.891 --> 00:59:30.950
<v Speaker 1>the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this filled with overwhelming hubris.</v>

967
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:36.490
<v Speaker 1>The Germans talk about what this was </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing to civilization and how they'd be </v>

968
00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:38.330
<v Speaker 1>willing to get into conversations about </v>
<v Speaker 1>ending it,</v>

969
00:59:38.331 --> 00:59:40.670
<v Speaker 1>but that they're still invincible than </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna win the war and they don't</v>

970
00:59:40.671 --> 00:59:44.370
<v Speaker 1>need to do this and what would the terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>be on the other side?</v>

971
00:59:44.371 --> 00:59:49.371
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could say that allies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>historians have argued about the motives</v>

972
00:59:50.041 --> 00:59:52.680
<v Speaker 1>behind this ever since,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth of the matter is,</v>

973
00:59:52.681 --> 00:59:57.681
<v Speaker 1>if you look at this like a card game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were some good reasons for the </v>

974
00:59:57.681 --> 01:00:01.221
<v Speaker 1>Germans to play that piece card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not it was realistic and </v>

975
01:00:01.221 --> 01:00:02.670
<v Speaker 1>whether or not the other side accepted </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

976
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:07.140
<v Speaker 1>and some historians say this was what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was intended to do the whole time.</v>

977
01:00:07.590 --> 01:00:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Provide some diplomatic cover for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>start of the unleashing of the </v>

978
01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:14.520
<v Speaker 1>submarines to go and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

979
01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when it's rejected.</v>

980
01:00:17.341 --> 01:00:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Being able to turn around to your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and say,</v>

981
01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better give up those hopes.</v>

982
01:00:22.441 --> 01:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Have an easy piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just tried.</v>

983
01:00:24.001 --> 01:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>They won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a fight to the end,</v>

984
01:00:25.801 --> 01:00:30.801
<v Speaker 1>stiff in yourself and also to show the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world including the neutrals and </v>

985
01:00:30.801 --> 01:00:34.341
<v Speaker 1>including the people on the other side </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the wars population that we're not </v>

986
01:00:34.341 --> 01:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>the ones keeping this carnage going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could have been over,</v>

987
01:00:35.791 --> 01:00:40.791
<v Speaker 1>but your side wants to keep fighting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most especially is an attempt to maybe </v>

988
01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:45.250
<v Speaker 1>influence public opinion in the neutral </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

989
01:00:45.251 --> 01:00:46.990
<v Speaker 1>especially the most important neutral </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

990
01:00:46.991 --> 01:00:51.991
<v Speaker 1>The United States which has so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>German Americans in it that there are </v>

991
01:00:51.991 --> 01:00:55.570
<v Speaker 1>more than 520 German language newspapers</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said.</v>

992
01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:01.020
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the editorials are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be in those newspapers after </v>

993
01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Germany makes a peace proposal and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>allies swatted down?</v>

994
01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:10.160
<v Speaker 1>That's going to put some pressure on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>US government to stay out of the war to </v>

995
01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>and that's going to influence American </v>
<v Speaker 1>public opinion over who the bad guys and</v>

996
01:01:11.731 --> 01:01:16.731
<v Speaker 1>who the good guys are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That may have been the overriding </v>

997
01:01:16.731 --> 01:01:17.730
<v Speaker 1>intention of this German piece effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody knows.</v>

998
01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:22.970
<v Speaker 1>It may have been a serious attempt to at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least start negotiations going and to </v>

999
01:01:23.881 --> 01:01:27.270
<v Speaker 1>take a position that didn't make you </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to vulnerable at the outset.</v>

1000
01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:28.890
<v Speaker 1>The Germans picked the right time to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1001
01:01:28.891 --> 01:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>It was right after the capital of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romania fell to the central power,</v>

1002
01:01:32.191 --> 01:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>so were they're negotiating from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>position of strength here and the allies</v>

1003
01:01:36.511 --> 01:01:39.600
<v Speaker 1>swatted down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to.</v>

1004
01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.680
<v Speaker 1>The problem with asking these powers to </v>
<v Speaker 1>state publicly what their war aims are </v>

1005
01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:51.630
<v Speaker 1>in order to create a piece is to show </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the war aims of these powers have </v>

1006
01:01:51.630 --> 01:01:56.311
<v Speaker 1>gotten so out of hand that they bear no </v>
<v Speaker 1>resemblance to anything that could be </v>

1007
01:01:56.311 --> 01:02:00.451
<v Speaker 1>negotiated as historian Gwynne Dyer road</v>
<v Speaker 1>in as we may have quoted already on this</v>

1008
01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:01.820
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

1009
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>what the governments of Europe who found</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves trapped in the first total </v>

1010
01:02:07.230 --> 01:02:10.621
<v Speaker 1>war discovered to their dismay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that if the means used to fight the </v>

1011
01:02:10.621 --> 01:02:12.490
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our total then so must be the ends.</v>

1012
01:02:12.790 --> 01:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>It was almost impossible to stop short </v>
<v Speaker 1>of total victory for one side and </v>

1013
01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:21.901
<v Speaker 1>unconditional surrender for the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to quote the old territorial </v>

1014
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:27.750
<v Speaker 1>exchanges and the paying of reparations </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

1015
01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:31.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving up or acquiring of colonies was a</v>

1016
01:02:31.801 --> 01:02:36.801
<v Speaker 1>19th century sort of war aim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sounded out of place in the 20th </v>

1017
01:02:36.801 --> 01:02:41.391
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the British or the French or the </v>

1018
01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:41.391
<v Speaker 1>Germans or anyone had said that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>was involved,</v>

1019
01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:46.280
<v Speaker 1>a little change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a territory and a little reparations </v>

1020
01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:49.191
<v Speaker 1>money or what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have seemed so out of </v>

1021
01:02:49.191 --> 01:02:51.531
<v Speaker 1>proportion to the cost that there would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a real danger that the public would </v>

1022
01:02:51.531 --> 01:02:56.481
<v Speaker 1>think that what the country was fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>for wasn't worth what the public was </v>

1023
01:02:56.481 --> 01:02:56.481
<v Speaker 1>paying for it.</v>

1024
01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>In addition to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course there were some craven </v>

1025
01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:05.420
<v Speaker 1>territorial ambitions involved and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one wanted to state those.</v>

1026
01:03:05.421 --> 01:03:10.421
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both sides had promised other people's </v>

1027
01:03:10.421 --> 01:03:12.170
<v Speaker 1>territories to allies of theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1028
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:16.970
<v Speaker 1>the Italians were promised territory </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Austrian Hungarian Empire.</v>

1029
01:03:16.971 --> 01:03:21.971
<v Speaker 1>Once the war was over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British couldn't very well say that </v>

1030
01:03:21.971 --> 01:03:25.040
<v Speaker 1>was a war aim and still not look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical gamesman in this war.</v>

1031
01:03:25.041 --> 01:03:30.041
<v Speaker 1>When everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way on all these sides is a </v>

1032
01:03:30.041 --> 01:03:30.980
<v Speaker 1>cynical games win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't show that to the public.</v>

1033
01:03:30.981 --> 01:03:35.981
<v Speaker 1>What's more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of war aims that stopped short </v>

1034
01:03:35.981 --> 01:03:39.401
<v Speaker 1>of defeating the enemy unconditionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>clashed with your propaganda.</v>

1035
01:03:40.790 --> 01:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>This is a war that's using such 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century ideas as a war to end all wars </v>

1036
01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:52.070
<v Speaker 1>and a war to make the world safe for </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy.</v>

1037
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:56.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not a war to acquire a few colonies</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the Mediterranean and some oil in the</v>

1038
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Middle East and the breakup of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Austrian Hungarian Empire.</v>

1039
01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:04.630
<v Speaker 1>It's a war for these high minded ideals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is as if your propaganda </v>

1040
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:07.430
<v Speaker 1>portrays the Germans as the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming of the Hmong goals will actually,</v>

1041
01:04:07.431 --> 01:04:12.431
<v Speaker 1>the huns is the word the propaganda used</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're baby killers and nurse </v>

1042
01:04:12.431 --> 01:04:16.100
<v Speaker 1>executioners and none rapers and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that propaganda makes them out to</v>

1043
01:04:16.101 --> 01:04:18.530
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you possibly sit down and sign a</v>

1044
01:04:18.531 --> 01:04:21.530
<v Speaker 1>piece of paper to compromise with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and have peace again,</v>

1045
01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:27.940
<v Speaker 1>when the Vatican was a at this time </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to help create the conditions </v>

1046
01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:32.861
<v Speaker 1>where peace could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Vatican kept telling the powers to </v>

1047
01:04:32.861 --> 01:04:35.030
<v Speaker 1>live up to those prewar agreements to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make war less horrible,</v>

1048
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:40.510
<v Speaker 1>and they were saying that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>favoring this not because they were </v>

1049
01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:45.010
<v Speaker 1>idealists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because if these powers kept doing </v>

1050
01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:46.640
<v Speaker 1>everything in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know might to destroy one another.</v>

1051
01:04:46.641 --> 01:04:49.610
<v Speaker 1>They were going to hate each other so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much that there was going to be no space</v>

1052
01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:52.910
<v Speaker 1>and mutual respect left to carve out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece later,</v>

1053
01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:58.580
<v Speaker 1>the Germans were no happier by the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to state their war aims publicly for the</v>

1054
01:04:58.581 --> 01:05:01.970
<v Speaker 1>exact same reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1055
01:05:01.971 --> 01:05:06.971
<v Speaker 1>there was an implied threat included </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the Germans came forward with this </v>

1056
01:05:06.971 --> 01:05:10.421
<v Speaker 1>attempt to get negotiations started and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the implied threat was if negotiations </v>

1057
01:05:10.821 --> 01:05:15.821
<v Speaker 1>didn't happen in weren't fruitful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would play the unrestricted </v>

1058
01:05:15.821 --> 01:05:19.571
<v Speaker 1>submarine warfare card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The peace negotiations are over by the </v>

1059
01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>end of January,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of January.</v>

1060
01:05:23.261 --> 01:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're on January 20th.</v>

1061
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Wilson makes a famous speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a speech where he calls for peace </v>

1062
01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>without victory</v>

1063
01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:38.100
<v Speaker 1>in his so called Peace Without victory </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech on the 22nd of January when </v>

1064
01:05:38.141 --> 01:05:41.020
<v Speaker 1>essentially he already knew that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't going to happen.</v>

1065
01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Wilson lays down the kind of peace that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe will have to broker to end the </v>

1066
01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:47.560
<v Speaker 1>first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's to be a lasting peace.</v>

1067
01:05:47.561 --> 01:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>It can't be one of those pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know where the knife is turned in.</v>

1068
01:05:50.831 --> 01:05:54.730
<v Speaker 1>One side is left hating the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about how the first world</v>

1069
01:05:54.731 --> 01:05:58.330
<v Speaker 1>war ended and how it's sowed the seeds </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Second World War,</v>

1070
01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Wilson sounds like nostradamus was some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things he says in this part of </v>

1071
01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:04.310
<v Speaker 1>the speech where he talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1072
01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:06.760
<v Speaker 1>having to have this kind of peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1073
01:06:06.761 --> 01:06:11.761
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am seeking only to face realities and </v>

1074
01:06:11.761 --> 01:06:15.190
<v Speaker 1>to face them without soft concealments </v>
<v Speaker 1>victory would mean peace forced upon the</v>

1075
01:06:15.191 --> 01:06:18.790
<v Speaker 1>loser of Victor's terms imposed upon the</v>
<v Speaker 1>vanquished.</v>

1076
01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:22.180
<v Speaker 1>It would be accepted in humiliation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under duress,</v>

1077
01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:25.630
<v Speaker 1>at an intolerable sacrifice and would </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave a sting,</v>

1078
01:06:25.810 --> 01:06:30.810
<v Speaker 1>a resentment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bitter memory upon which terms of </v>

1079
01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:30.810
<v Speaker 1>peace would rest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not permanently,</v>

1080
01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:36.030
<v Speaker 1>but only as upon quicksand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only a piece between equals can last </v>

1081
01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:40.830
<v Speaker 1>only a piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The very principle of which is equality </v>

1082
01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:41.350
<v Speaker 1>and a common participation in a common </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit.</v>

1083
01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:45.040
<v Speaker 1>The right state of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right feeling between nations,</v>

1084
01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:48.880
<v Speaker 1>it is necessary for a lasting peace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as is a just settlement,</v>

1085
01:06:48.881 --> 01:06:53.050
<v Speaker 1>a vexed questions of territory or of </v>
<v Speaker 1>racial and national allegiance</v>

1086
01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:59.180
<v Speaker 1>end quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's not only calling for a piece </v>

1087
01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:03.670
<v Speaker 1>where nobody can claim a victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just stopped fighting and begin </v>

1088
01:07:03.801 --> 01:07:08.801
<v Speaker 1>negotiating for a postwar world in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilson and envisions a new international</v>

1089
01:07:10.941 --> 01:07:15.941
<v Speaker 1>global structure to enforce global peace</v>
<v Speaker 1>and harmony so that we never have a </v>

1090
01:07:17.781 --> 01:07:18.890
<v Speaker 1>first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>

1091
01:07:18.891 --> 01:07:23.891
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those historians who suggests that </v>

1092
01:07:23.891 --> 01:07:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Wilson is out to make Wilson the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical figure he can,</v>

1093
01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:28.310
<v Speaker 1>that would be a heck of a legacy if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>could pull that off,</v>

1094
01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:32.980
<v Speaker 1>but instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within a couple of months,</v>

1095
01:07:33.490 --> 01:07:38.470
<v Speaker 1>the United States will be in the war and</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the allied perspective,</v>

1096
01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:43.950
<v Speaker 1>not a moment too soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The end of 1916,</v>

1097
01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:49.280
<v Speaker 1>early 1917,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've been spending quite a bit of </v>

1098
01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:52.371
<v Speaker 1>time setting this period in the war up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this period in the war is probably </v>

1099
01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:56.430
<v Speaker 1>the most important six months in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last hundred years.</v>

1100
01:07:58.490 --> 01:08:03.490
<v Speaker 1>People talk about the first world war is</v>
<v Speaker 1>this transformative moment and the </v>

1101
01:08:03.490 --> 01:08:04.220
<v Speaker 1>aftereffects that were living with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1102
01:08:04.221 --> 01:08:09.221
<v Speaker 1>even now all around us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the most transformative moment in </v>

1103
01:08:09.221 --> 01:08:13.250
<v Speaker 1>that conflict is what's about to happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and you know,</v>

1104
01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:16.790
<v Speaker 1>I can't help but find some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analogy approach to looking at it,</v>

1105
01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:21.791
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it's like we have this tree </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've been shopping at it for two </v>

1106
01:08:21.791 --> 01:08:23.540
<v Speaker 1>years and at the end of 1916 and finally</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tree falls over.</v>

1107
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:27.260
<v Speaker 1>Winston Churchill says three ingredients</v>
<v Speaker 1>acting together,</v>

1108
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:31.310
<v Speaker 1>create what he calls the second climax </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the war.</v>

1109
01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:34.940
<v Speaker 1>In this period we've dealt with two of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those ingredients,</v>

1110
01:08:34.941 --> 01:08:37.670
<v Speaker 1>the Americans and the submarine </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

1111
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:42.890
<v Speaker 1>The third ingredient involves Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Up till now,</v>

1112
01:08:42.891 --> 01:08:45.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pretty obvious in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode we've been dealing with what you</v>

1113
01:08:45.471 --> 01:08:50.471
<v Speaker 1>could safely call the first rate powers </v>
<v Speaker 1>the countries that were at the top of </v>

1114
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:53.150
<v Speaker 1>everything when the war started.</v>

1115
01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:54.260
<v Speaker 1>The rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>

1116
01:08:54.261 --> 01:08:55.700
<v Speaker 1>cohesive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unified,</v>

1117
01:08:56.220 --> 01:08:57.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of the Line States,</v>

1118
01:08:57.591 --> 01:08:58.730
<v Speaker 1>the Francis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Britains,</v>

1119
01:08:58.731 --> 01:09:03.731
<v Speaker 1>the Germany's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they're worn down by this many </v>

1120
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:08.360
<v Speaker 1>years of this war to this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to where they are now,</v>

1121
01:09:08.361 --> 01:09:12.560
<v Speaker 1>where the Germans are undernourished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a more provocative term,</v>

1122
01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:18.200
<v Speaker 1>what must be the situation that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that weren't first rate powers</v>

1123
01:09:18.201 --> 01:09:23.201
<v Speaker 1>in the war started?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones that had challenges and we're </v>

1124
01:09:23.201 --> 01:09:24.590
<v Speaker 1>struggling in various areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are two years of war treating them?</v>

1125
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Italians have opened disagreements </v>

1126
01:09:31.030 --> 01:09:32.640
<v Speaker 1>about peace in their government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1127
01:09:32.690 --> 01:09:34.160
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the trenches,</v>

1128
01:09:34.161 --> 01:09:39.161
<v Speaker 1>there are pamphlets distributed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialists that say next winter,</v>

1129
01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:44.620
<v Speaker 1>not another man in the trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The generals are not very pleased with </v>

1130
01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:45.680
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard to blame the Italians.</v>

1131
01:09:45.681 --> 01:09:49.580
<v Speaker 1>They were on like their 10th or 11th </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle of the [inaudible] river fighting</v>

1132
01:09:49.581 --> 01:09:52.370
<v Speaker 1>over this torture risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountainous terrain,</v>

1133
01:09:52.371 --> 01:09:53.630
<v Speaker 1>which creates an environment.</v>

1134
01:09:54.050 --> 01:09:54.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1135
01:09:54.421 --> 01:09:58.880
<v Speaker 1>it's a little teeny horrible war in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>of itself with all these unique things.</v>

1136
01:09:58.881 --> 01:10:00.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to give you one example,</v>

1137
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:03.280
<v Speaker 1>in the mountain war that the Italians </v>
<v Speaker 1>are fighting with the Austro-hungarian,</v>

1138
01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:06.230
<v Speaker 1>when shells hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all carved into rock.</v>

1139
01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:07.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of trenches,</v>

1140
01:10:07.401 --> 01:10:11.330
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times they have blown out like </v>
<v Speaker 1>chasms for cover,</v>

1141
01:10:11.331 --> 01:10:14.600
<v Speaker 1>but when the shells hit the rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rocks just splinter,</v>

1142
01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:17.240
<v Speaker 1>creating like a secondary amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shrapnel.</v>

1143
01:10:17.241 --> 01:10:22.241
<v Speaker 1>That's just horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you get wounded your way </v>

1144
01:10:22.241 --> 01:10:22.241
<v Speaker 1>up at six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>7,000</v>

1145
01:10:22.241 --> 01:10:24.000
<v Speaker 1>feet and you got to be brought down </v>
<v Speaker 1>through mountaineers,</v>

1146
01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Alpine conditions to the nearest </v>
<v Speaker 1>waystation,</v>

1147
01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.640
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still find frozen things up there.</v>

1148
01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Even today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a horrible conflict and by 1960 and</v>

1149
01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:37.661
<v Speaker 1>the Italians are on like their 10th or </v>
<v Speaker 1>11th version of it and all they have to </v>

1150
01:10:37.661 --> 01:10:38.870
<v Speaker 1>show for it is more and more dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1151
01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:44.080
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't be human if they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to get a little fed up with </v>

1152
01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:44.080
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1153
01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:48.370
<v Speaker 1>that just puts them on par with how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems the populations of all the </v>

1154
01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:50.720
<v Speaker 1>belligerent countries are doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's Austria Hungary doing?</v>

1155
01:10:50.721 --> 01:10:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones that you know,</v>

1156
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:53.810
<v Speaker 1>kind of where we're at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ground Zero.</v>

1157
01:10:53.811 --> 01:10:58.811
<v Speaker 1>When this whole war got started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones who had the archduke </v>

1158
01:10:58.811 --> 01:11:02.171
<v Speaker 1>that got himself assassinated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones that sent that </v>

1159
01:11:02.171 --> 01:11:04.010
<v Speaker 1>uncompromising letter to the Serbians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones that sparked this war.</v>

1160
01:11:04.011 --> 01:11:05.540
<v Speaker 1>How are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1161
01:11:05.541 --> 01:11:08.750
<v Speaker 1>I bet they wish they hadn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in terrible shape.</v>

1162
01:11:09.170 --> 01:11:11.690
<v Speaker 1>The venerable emperor that had ruled </v>
<v Speaker 1>there for so long,</v>

1163
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:15.330
<v Speaker 1>the benign face of stability had finally</v>
<v Speaker 1>died to be,</v>

1164
01:11:15.331 --> 01:11:16.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1165
01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:21.860
<v Speaker 1>succeeded by the next emperor who's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>much younger man and who looks at his </v>

1166
01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:26.391
<v Speaker 1>country and says to the Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this war has to end in 1917 when </v>

1167
01:11:26.391 --> 01:11:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Austria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungary is worse than done</v>

1168
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:33.240
<v Speaker 1>this new emperor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During this coming year,</v>

1169
01:11:33.241 --> 01:11:38.140
<v Speaker 1>we'll go behind the Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the allies reportedly and try to</v>

1170
01:11:38.141 --> 01:11:41.610
<v Speaker 1>sort of sell them out and the Germans </v>
<v Speaker 1>find out about it and then they're never</v>

1171
01:11:41.611 --> 01:11:43.470
<v Speaker 1>going to take their eyes off Austria </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry again.</v>

1172
01:11:43.471 --> 01:11:44.630
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1173
01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.890
<v Speaker 1>these brothers in arms don't trust each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other anymore.</v>

1174
01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:50.190
<v Speaker 1>And it was a very interesting move that </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have talked about.</v>

1175
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:54.810
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like world war one's version</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Rudolf Hess flying to Great Britain,</v>

1176
01:11:55.020 --> 01:12:00.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a separate piece for Nazi </v>

1177
01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Germany and the Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just this weird little endeavor.</v>

1178
01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:02.280
<v Speaker 1>And all it does is earn Austria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungary.</v>

1179
01:12:02.281 --> 01:12:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Germany's Ms Dot Trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have the Russians.</v>

1180
01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians from the very start of this</v>

1181
01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:16.561
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even before this war for a very long </v>

1182
01:12:16.561 --> 01:12:17.170
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been this contradiction in power.</v>

1183
01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:22.680
<v Speaker 1>In one sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are massively powerful in a </v>

1184
01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:23.920
<v Speaker 1>military sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Theoretically they are terrifying</v>

1185
01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:30.160
<v Speaker 1>and yet they are at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fatally flawed in the underpinnings </v>

1186
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:36.070
<v Speaker 1>that anything Russia's doing in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're always seems to be like writing </v>

1187
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:38.690
<v Speaker 1>some rail or or walking a tight rope and</v>
<v Speaker 1>and disaster loomed at any moment.</v>

1188
01:12:38.691 --> 01:12:42.080
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an unsteady sort of situation.</v>

1189
01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:47.620
<v Speaker 1>There's a story that sort of shows this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this contradiction in terms the military</v>

1190
01:12:47.751 --> 01:12:49.550
<v Speaker 1>leader of the Russian military leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bruce seal off.</v>

1191
01:12:49.551 --> 01:12:52.990
<v Speaker 1>He'll have an offensive named after him </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1916.</v>

1192
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.990
<v Speaker 1>We talked about it nowhere near as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it deserves in the last program.</v>

1193
01:12:57.890 --> 01:13:02.890
<v Speaker 1>This once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>push the Russians out there in a good </v>

1194
01:13:02.890 --> 01:13:03.110
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows you what they can do when they get</v>

1195
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:06.020
<v Speaker 1>their act together and they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>devastating.</v>

1196
01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Seven hundred and 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties on the Austria.</v>

1197
01:13:08.761 --> 01:13:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean essentially mortally wounded than</v>

1198
01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:14.390
<v Speaker 1>it is frightening what the Russians can </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

1199
01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:19.840
<v Speaker 1>you know when things go the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Priscilla of tells a story that </v>

1200
01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:22.370
<v Speaker 1>shows you just how fatally compromised </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is.</v>

1201
01:13:22.371 --> 01:13:23.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how rotten the insides are.</v>

1202
01:13:23.961 --> 01:13:26.390
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the height of this offensive,</v>

1203
01:13:26.391 --> 01:13:30.770
<v Speaker 1>when everything's going so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's receiving unsigned letters from his</v>

1204
01:13:30.771 --> 01:13:34.670
<v Speaker 1>own soldiers telling him that if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting doesn't stop soon,</v>

1205
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:36.260
<v Speaker 1>they're going to kill him.</v>

1206
01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Russia has been having internal problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>for decades.</v>

1207
01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:47.400
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The current Tsar,</v>

1208
01:13:47.730 --> 01:13:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas the second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1209
01:13:49.801 --> 01:13:51.600
<v Speaker 1>the czar desire is not even his right </v>
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>

1210
01:13:51.601 --> 01:13:56.601
<v Speaker 1>He's the emperor of Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The czar is the old name that goes back </v>

1211
01:13:56.601 --> 01:13:59.541
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they still call them that because </v>

1212
01:13:59.541 --> 01:14:00.300
<v Speaker 1>that's essentially what the office still</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in his name,</v>

1213
01:14:00.301 --> 01:14:03.210
<v Speaker 1>his official long title that says he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the autocrat.</v>

1214
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:04.580
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1215
01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:09.680
<v Speaker 1>even if the Russian doom has been given </v>
<v Speaker 1>one percent and the czar still has 99 </v>

1216
01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:12.340
<v Speaker 1>percent of the power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

1217
01:14:12.450 --> 01:14:16.840
<v Speaker 1>an example of the old world at its most </v>
<v Speaker 1>royal.</v>

1218
01:14:18.210 --> 01:14:22.980
<v Speaker 1>And yet he knows how frightfully fragile</v>
<v Speaker 1>the underpinnings are.</v>

1219
01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:28.280
<v Speaker 1>When he was emir adolescent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he saw his grandfather carried into the </v>

1220
01:14:28.981 --> 01:14:33.300
<v Speaker 1>royal palace with his legs torn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shreds,</v>

1221
01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:35.730
<v Speaker 1>his groin gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his stomach ripped out,</v>

1222
01:14:35.970 --> 01:14:40.970
<v Speaker 1>and his face mangled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he is bleeding out on the royal </v>

1223
01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:42.960
<v Speaker 1>carpet and the royal family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including Nicholas.</v>

1224
01:14:42.961 --> 01:14:47.961
<v Speaker 1>The second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man who will be Nicholas the second </v>

1225
01:14:47.961 --> 01:14:48.300
<v Speaker 1>watch their grandfather die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes about 15 minutes</v>

1226
01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:54.520
<v Speaker 1>he'd been killed in an assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another one of these stories where you </v>

1227
01:14:55.551 --> 01:14:59.780
<v Speaker 1>know the czar is out in his bulletproof </v>
<v Speaker 1>sled and I am a bomber.</v>

1228
01:14:59.781 --> 01:15:04.781
<v Speaker 1>Throws a bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds a little like the whole Sarah </v>

1229
01:15:04.781 --> 01:15:04.781
<v Speaker 1>Gevo thing that kicked off the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>world war.</v>

1230
01:15:04.781 --> 01:15:05.540
<v Speaker 1>A bomber throws a bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bomb goes off,</v>

1231
01:15:05.541 --> 01:15:08.600
<v Speaker 1>kills people who are not the target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The target comes out.</v>

1232
01:15:08.601 --> 01:15:13.601
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the czar comes out to look around and </v>

1233
01:15:13.601 --> 01:15:16.031
<v Speaker 1>there's another bomber in the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly desire at the time had said </v>

1234
01:15:16.031 --> 01:15:16.031
<v Speaker 1>something about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1235
01:15:16.031 --> 01:15:19.100
<v Speaker 1>thank God that nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other assassins as he's throwing</v>

1236
01:15:19.101 --> 01:15:21.680
<v Speaker 1>the bomb and him saying it's a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>too early to thank God,</v>

1237
01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:27.220
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he bleeds out in the royal palace </v>

1238
01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:30.371
<v Speaker 1>floor while the czar who will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>commanding Russia as the autocrat in the</v>

1239
01:15:30.561 --> 01:15:34.640
<v Speaker 1>first world war as a 13 or 14 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>boy watches.</v>

1240
01:15:34.641 --> 01:15:39.641
<v Speaker 1>He knows how dangerous the job is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he knows that there's a violent </v>

1241
01:15:40.851 --> 01:15:45.851
<v Speaker 1>current of rottenness that opposes his </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and he's dealing with it all the </v>

1242
01:15:46.221 --> 01:15:51.221
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that makes this story </v>

1243
01:15:51.221 --> 01:15:55.881
<v Speaker 1>so interesting though is when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with one person with almost </v>

1244
01:15:55.881 --> 01:15:57.360
<v Speaker 1>total power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said earlier,</v>

1245
01:15:57.690 --> 01:16:02.690
<v Speaker 1>their little idiosyncrasies make a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>impact on history.</v>

1246
01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:05.490
<v Speaker 1>In the case of Nicholas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second,</v>

1247
01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.070
<v Speaker 1>the autocrat of all the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1248
01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:13.880
<v Speaker 1>His idiosyncrasies involve some things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think most people out there who </v>

1249
01:16:15.241 --> 01:16:18.900
<v Speaker 1>have children can at least relate to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of.</v>

1250
01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:25.620
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that there's a part to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this story that just has a personal </v>

1251
01:16:26.051 --> 01:16:28.990
<v Speaker 1>tragedy wrapped up in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1252
01:16:28.991 --> 01:16:33.991
<v Speaker 1>this is an example why you can't reduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>history to some sort of mathematical </v>

1253
01:16:33.991 --> 01:16:37.250
<v Speaker 1>equation or some sort of predictable set</v>
<v Speaker 1>of rules are.</v>

1254
01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:39.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are human beings involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1255
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:43.360
<v Speaker 1>In the case of the Tsar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating story.</v>

1256
01:16:43.361 --> 01:16:44.950
<v Speaker 1>The man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so you know,</v>

1257
01:16:44.951 --> 01:16:49.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is how Europe was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the old Europe that's being </v>

1258
01:16:49.951 --> 01:16:52.411
<v Speaker 1>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the first or second cousin with </v>

1259
01:16:52.411 --> 01:16:55.410
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the first cousin with the King of </v>

1260
01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:59.261
<v Speaker 1>England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the second cousin with the emperor </v>

1261
01:16:59.261 --> 01:16:59.510
<v Speaker 1>of Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's related to everybody and his</v>

1262
01:16:59.511 --> 01:17:03.050
<v Speaker 1>wife is the first cousin of the King of </v>
<v Speaker 1>England.</v>

1263
01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:08.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean a little incestuous maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that explains why the czar and his </v>

1264
01:17:11.041 --> 01:17:16.041
<v Speaker 1>wife more than her in a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who only have one son give birth to a </v>

1265
01:17:16.351 --> 01:17:21.351
<v Speaker 1>son who's a hemophiliac.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It runs in the family Queen Victoria,</v>

1266
01:17:22.461 --> 01:17:23.600
<v Speaker 1>who sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1267
01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:26.480
<v Speaker 1>the descended that all these people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>trace their heritage back.</v>

1268
01:17:26.481 --> 01:17:28.370
<v Speaker 1>You said that this did not run in her </v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

1269
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:34.000
<v Speaker 1>but it seemed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Victoria of course was German and her </v>

1270
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.461
<v Speaker 1>roots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was the czar's wife has Arina </v>

1271
01:17:38.461 --> 01:17:38.461
<v Speaker 1>Alexandra.</v>

1272
01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Both of them loved each other,</v>

1273
01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.580
<v Speaker 1>and I say this because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think today we'll.</v>

1274
01:17:44.581 --> 01:17:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Of course they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but listen,</v>

1275
01:17:45.961 --> 01:17:48.510
<v Speaker 1>this is an era where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially amongst nobility,</v>

1276
01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:53.660
<v Speaker 1>you often had very political marriages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also had these very old fashioned </v>

1277
01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:54.780
<v Speaker 1>things that were very common back then </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the husband and wife really didn't</v>

1278
01:17:54.781 --> 01:17:56.460
<v Speaker 1>love each other and the husband was out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1279
01:17:56.461 --> 01:18:00.240
<v Speaker 1>with all the girls all at it wasn't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that with Nicholas and Alexandra.</v>

1280
01:18:00.241 --> 01:18:02.460
<v Speaker 1>This is what this was a love story and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it really was,</v>

1281
01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:05.910
<v Speaker 1>and not just between the two of them but</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their children too.</v>

1282
01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:11.240
<v Speaker 1>They loved their children the way we </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of every modern person loving </v>

1283
01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:15.501
<v Speaker 1>their children or the way they should </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is not to say that people in </v>

1284
01:18:15.501 --> 01:18:18.771
<v Speaker 1>the past didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you find a lot of examples in </v>

1285
01:18:18.771 --> 01:18:21.891
<v Speaker 1>the royal families throughout history </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the father hardly sees the son </v>

1286
01:18:21.891 --> 01:18:21.891
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like that with these guys.</v>

1287
01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:27.110
<v Speaker 1>They take an active day to day role in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their parenting and they wrote letters </v>

1288
01:18:27.110 --> 01:18:29.280
<v Speaker 1>to each other constantly and they wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>in English,</v>

1289
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:31.970
<v Speaker 1>which they both spoke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1290
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:34.130
<v Speaker 1>this is our arena was German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

1291
01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.170
<v Speaker 1>But she spoke Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She spoke English,</v>

1292
01:18:36.171 --> 01:18:41.171
<v Speaker 1>does our spoke everything and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicated in more than a thousand </v>

1293
01:18:41.171 --> 01:18:42.440
<v Speaker 1>letters with each other where you get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>real feel for these people.</v>

1294
01:18:42.650 --> 01:18:47.650
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely terrified about is their son </v>

1295
01:18:47.650 --> 01:18:48.650
<v Speaker 1>who's got hemophilia,</v>

1296
01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:54.920
<v Speaker 1>he's their only son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the czar and he is almost certainly</v>

1297
01:18:55.650 --> 01:18:58.050
<v Speaker 1>going to die young from this disease </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

1298
01:18:58.051 --> 01:19:00.390
<v Speaker 1>just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hemophilia is a disease where your blood</v>

1299
01:19:00.391 --> 01:19:05.391
<v Speaker 1>doesn't clot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to get too technical because I </v>

1300
01:19:05.391 --> 01:19:05.391
<v Speaker 1>couldn't explain it any way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

1301
01:19:05.391 --> 01:19:09.860
<v Speaker 1>but basically any little cut or bruise </v>
<v Speaker 1>has the potential to spiral out of </v>

1302
01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:13.410
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The normal in a rough and tumble of a,</v>

1303
01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:18.390
<v Speaker 1>of a young child's life will kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in this era,</v>

1304
01:19:18.391 --> 01:19:23.391
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents just assumed almost a death </v>

1305
01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:23.490
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these two parents,</v>

1306
01:19:23.491 --> 01:19:28.491
<v Speaker 1>as any parents we would think of today </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably could hardly handle that </v>

1307
01:19:28.491 --> 01:19:29.990
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were looking around for curious</v>

1308
01:19:29.991 --> 01:19:34.991
<v Speaker 1>and trying to find them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And eventually they found someone who </v>

1309
01:19:34.991 --> 01:19:38.831
<v Speaker 1>seemed to be able to fix their son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of the little idiosyncrasy </v>

1310
01:19:39.301 --> 01:19:41.760
<v Speaker 1>connected to who this person tended to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

1311
01:19:42.930 --> 01:19:44.880
<v Speaker 1>world history is completely altered.</v>

1312
01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:52.360
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the funny part about it is an </v>

1313
01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:52.360
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tragic story.</v>

1314
01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:52.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting story.</v>

1315
01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:57.251
<v Speaker 1>It's a very human story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are elements to it that would </v>

1316
01:19:57.251 --> 01:19:59.240
<v Speaker 1>make a good sitcom or a good movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>premise,</v>

1317
01:19:59.241 --> 01:20:01.580
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I walked in to talk about this today,</v>

1318
01:20:01.581 --> 01:20:06.581
<v Speaker 1>I remembered the movie that was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on the premise that it had nick </v>

1319
01:20:06.581 --> 01:20:09.611
<v Speaker 1>naulty entity was called down and out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beverly Hills and the story is about a </v>

1320
01:20:09.611 --> 01:20:12.270
<v Speaker 1>vagrant kinda homeless kind of guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>by hook or by crook ends up,</v>

1321
01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:17.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in living with a rich family in beverly </v>

1322
01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:17.570
<v Speaker 1>hills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really fabulously rich family.</v>

1323
01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:22.460
<v Speaker 1>And of course because of the dichotomy </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their lifestyles and the way they </v>

1324
01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:22.460
<v Speaker 1>view the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarity ensues,</v>

1325
01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:27.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's Kinda what happened with the </v>

1326
01:20:27.170 --> 01:20:29.490
<v Speaker 1>tsar and his wife and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>hemophiliac son when they found somebody</v>

1327
01:20:29.491 --> 01:20:34.491
<v Speaker 1>who seemed to be able to heal him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that somebody was basically the </v>

1328
01:20:34.491 --> 01:20:36.870
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of the vagrant in down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in Beverly Hills.</v>

1329
01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:42.740
<v Speaker 1>They were bringing a peasant in to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a look at their sick son.</v>

1330
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Peasants name is Gregory Rasputin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And history has always been.</v>

1331
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:52.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a hardcore history personality.</v>

1332
01:20:52.731 --> 01:20:53.810
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever found one.</v>

1333
01:20:55.820 --> 01:21:00.820
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that this government was </v>
<v Speaker 1>run 99 percent by one guy and his wife </v>

1334
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:08.110
<v Speaker 1>opens up the door to a greg gory </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rasputin being able to have the effect </v>

1335
01:21:08.241 --> 01:21:13.241
<v Speaker 1>on history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had historian Peter Hart does a good </v>

1336
01:21:13.241 --> 01:21:16.620
<v Speaker 1>job of of framing all the various things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seem to be going on at once,</v>

1337
01:21:16.621 --> 01:21:20.550
<v Speaker 1>including what I just talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the way Russia is sort of a giant,</v>

1338
01:21:20.551 --> 01:21:25.551
<v Speaker 1>but hamstrung by this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ancient system of theirs so that a </v>

1339
01:21:25.551 --> 01:21:29.391
<v Speaker 1>guy like Rasputin could make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in the idiosyncrasies of a </v>

1340
01:21:29.391 --> 01:21:30.330
<v Speaker 1>single individual or two could come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fore.</v>

1341
01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:31.440
<v Speaker 1>He writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

1342
01:21:32.210 --> 01:21:37.210
<v Speaker 1>the Russian homefront was gradually </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsing under the intolerable strain </v>

1343
01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:41.141
<v Speaker 1>of war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The czarist government did not have the </v>

1344
01:21:41.141 --> 01:21:42.380
<v Speaker 1>flexibility necessary to cope with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plague of economic,</v>

1345
01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:47.560
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and social problems that infected the </v>

1346
01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:50.261
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tsar himself perceived any form of </v>

1347
01:21:50.261 --> 01:21:52.730
<v Speaker 1>democracy is a threat to his regime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rather than introducing an increased</v>

1348
01:21:52.731 --> 01:21:57.731
<v Speaker 1>measure of liberalism was more attracted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the idea of a total disillusion of </v>

1349
01:21:57.731 --> 01:22:02.030
<v Speaker 1>even the tokenistic Duma appointments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depositions of considerable authority.</v>

1350
01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:07.240
<v Speaker 1>We're routinely assigned by the czar on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the grounds of either naked favoritism </v>

1351
01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.470
<v Speaker 1>or the authoritarian credentials of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate.</v>

1352
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:14.830
<v Speaker 1>Spy scares raged through society with </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular suspicion falling on any </v>

1353
01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:19.271
<v Speaker 1>Russian general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate enough to have a Germanic </v>

1354
01:22:19.271 --> 01:22:19.271
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

1355
01:22:19.271 --> 01:22:22.760
<v Speaker 1>incompetence and corruption blossomed </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfettered while at the center.</v>

1356
01:22:22.761 --> 01:22:27.080
<v Speaker 1>The tsar was publicly embarrassed by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>adherence of the Zarina Alexandra to the</v>

1357
01:22:27.081 --> 01:22:32.081
<v Speaker 1>ludicrous cult of Rasputin and unhinged </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious mystic with a pension for </v>

1358
01:22:32.091 --> 01:22:37.091
<v Speaker 1>irreligious pursuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole despotic system of government </v>

1359
01:22:37.091 --> 01:22:38.720
<v Speaker 1>was resting on just a few weak </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>

1360
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Russia was being hollowed out from </v>
<v Speaker 1>within,</v>

1361
01:22:41.450 --> 01:22:46.450
<v Speaker 1>and the vacuum at the center was </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating dangerous instability and the </v>

1362
01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:50.971
<v Speaker 1>quote now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that Peter Hart says right </v>

1363
01:22:50.971 --> 01:22:53.810
<v Speaker 1>there could have applied to several </v>
<v Speaker 1>other countries in this story.</v>

1364
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Everything except one thing.</v>

1365
01:22:57.150 --> 01:22:58.670
<v Speaker 1>The part dealing with recipe</v>

1366
01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Gregori.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rasputin is a great wildcard in the </v>

1367
01:23:05.290 --> 01:23:05.290
<v Speaker 1>story and a quintessentially Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure.</v>

1368
01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>

1369
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:11.340
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to imagine him anywhere else </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he is outrageous and larger than </v>

1370
01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:15.451
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think Peter Hart has great </v>

1371
01:23:15.451 --> 01:23:18.400
<v Speaker 1>historian as he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sounds a little bit like he can't </v>

1372
01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:18.400
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1373
01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.890
<v Speaker 1>the Zarina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wife of the czar kind of falling for</v>

1374
01:23:20.891 --> 01:23:24.310
<v Speaker 1>this guy and his shtick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He calls it the ludicrous Rasputin cult.</v>

1375
01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'd have had her here to ask her,</v>

1376
01:23:27.161 --> 01:23:32.161
<v Speaker 1>she'd probably say to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I saw him do it multiple times.</v>

1377
01:23:32.770 --> 01:23:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Do what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saved my son's life.</v>

1378
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:39.860
<v Speaker 1>If you saw somebody save your kid's life</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple times,</v>

1379
01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:46.450
<v Speaker 1>don't you think it would be hard to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>your logic override what you think you </v>

1380
01:23:46.450 --> 01:23:49.751
<v Speaker 1>saw?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen cold hearted total realists </v>

1381
01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:55.660
<v Speaker 1>turn into people seeking quack remedies </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were dying of cancer.</v>

1382
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:59.500
<v Speaker 1>They were looking for hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your kid is dying,</v>

1383
01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:02.230
<v Speaker 1>you're looking for hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if somebody actually comes through?</v>

1384
01:24:04.150 --> 01:24:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if that quack treatment for your </v>

1385
01:24:09.150 --> 01:24:11.860
<v Speaker 1>relatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terminal cancer cured the cancer.</v>

1386
01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:17.250
<v Speaker 1>That's the weirdness in this story that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the royal family,</v>

1387
01:24:17.251 --> 01:24:21.510
<v Speaker 1>the emperor and his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run into this Guy Gregory Rasputin first</v>

1388
01:24:21.810 --> 01:24:22.410
<v Speaker 1>in 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1389
01:24:22.411 --> 01:24:22.980
<v Speaker 1>five</v>

1390
01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:28.680
<v Speaker 1>about 10 years before the time period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are in the story and there's an entry</v>

1391
01:24:28.681 --> 01:24:33.681
<v Speaker 1>by the czar in his diary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We met a man of God today and so </v>

1392
01:24:33.681 --> 01:24:37.140
<v Speaker 1>starched this relationship between this </v>
<v Speaker 1>person who was born,</v>

1393
01:24:37.141 --> 01:24:40.260
<v Speaker 1>a poor peasant in Siberia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1394
01:24:40.261 --> 01:24:44.010
<v Speaker 1>uneducated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and his relationship with two</v>

1395
01:24:44.011 --> 01:24:46.710
<v Speaker 1>of the most royal figures in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1396
01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:48.450
<v Speaker 1>when you think of the king and queen of </v>
<v Speaker 1>England,</v>

1397
01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:52.020
<v Speaker 1>that's the level we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the czar and Sarina imagine today's</v>

1398
01:24:52.021 --> 01:24:53.970
<v Speaker 1>queen of England who has no power at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1399
01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:59.120
<v Speaker 1>picking up some person off the street </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's almost homeless and not even a </v>

1400
01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:02.631
<v Speaker 1>London homeless person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone from the sticks up in the north </v>

1401
01:25:02.631 --> 01:25:02.631
<v Speaker 1>of England somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some small town,</v>

1402
01:25:02.631 --> 01:25:07.190
<v Speaker 1>bringing them in the palace and having </v>
<v Speaker 1>them live with you for awhile and sort </v>

1403
01:25:07.190 --> 01:25:10.971
<v Speaker 1>of questioning them on the state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and what are the people saying </v>

1404
01:25:10.971 --> 01:25:13.590
<v Speaker 1>and and Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>letting the minister medicinally to your</v>

1405
01:25:13.591 --> 01:25:18.591
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy story and the only reason </v>

1406
01:25:18.591 --> 01:25:22.641
<v Speaker 1>Rasputin becomes important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can hardly imagine him important in </v>

1407
01:25:22.641 --> 01:25:25.170
<v Speaker 1>most of the other systems of government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because Russia is so autocratic,</v>

1408
01:25:25.230 --> 01:25:28.950
<v Speaker 1>if you capture the czar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you capture the country.</v>

1409
01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Rasputin made the royal family emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>hostages.</v>

1410
01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that was intentional or </v>

1411
01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:41.300
<v Speaker 1>otherwise is debatable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Historians disagree.</v>

1412
01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:46.760
<v Speaker 1>There are some historians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think this is a person who thought </v>

1413
01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:47.580
<v Speaker 1>he was a blessed man of God with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>special powers to do,</v>

1414
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:49.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious oriented things and others say</v>

1415
01:25:49.981 --> 01:25:54.981
<v Speaker 1>he's a charlatan and he knew he had the </v>
<v Speaker 1>royal couple sort of emotionally </v>

1416
01:25:54.981 --> 01:25:59.271
<v Speaker 1>blackmail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was nothing anyone could do </v>

1417
01:25:59.271 --> 01:25:59.271
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a great quote from the czar,</v>

1418
01:25:59.271 --> 01:26:00.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the story with Rasputin</v>

1419
01:26:00.661 --> 01:26:05.661
<v Speaker 1>where one of his advisors says something</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the effect of you to get rid of this </v>

1420
01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:05.840
<v Speaker 1>guy and the czar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his answer is,</v>

1421
01:26:05.841 --> 01:26:10.841
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing I can do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of historians have always </v>

1422
01:26:10.841 --> 01:26:13.460
<v Speaker 1>interpreted that to mean that the czar </v>
<v Speaker 1>is basically saying he can't stand up to</v>

1423
01:26:13.461 --> 01:26:14.960
<v Speaker 1>his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1424
01:26:14.961 --> 01:26:19.961
<v Speaker 1>that she wants him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing that the czar can </v>

1425
01:26:19.961 --> 01:26:19.961
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1426
01:26:19.961 --> 01:26:19.961
<v Speaker 1>He won't stand up to his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1427
01:26:19.961 --> 01:26:20.870
<v Speaker 1>some historians have come out recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

1428
01:26:20.871 --> 01:26:25.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could easily mean there's nothing he </v>

1429
01:26:25.871 --> 01:26:26.630
<v Speaker 1>can do about it because there's only one</v>
<v Speaker 1>person who can save their son's life.</v>

1430
01:26:26.631 --> 01:26:28.160
<v Speaker 1>The heir to the throne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

1431
01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:33.520
<v Speaker 1>if you really believed that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rasputin guys got you in a weird </v>

1432
01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:35.210
<v Speaker 1>position between 19 Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

1433
01:26:35.211 --> 01:26:40.211
<v Speaker 1>When the czar and Rasputin first meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>and where we are in this story right </v>

1434
01:26:40.211 --> 01:26:41.090
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late 1916,</v>

1435
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Rasputin has been warming his way into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the czars family pretty consistently.</v>

1436
01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Not as circle of friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his family,</v>

1437
01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:51.340
<v Speaker 1>the czar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have these get togethers sometimes</v>

1438
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:55.070
<v Speaker 1>it was him and his wife and his kids and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rasputin.</v>

1439
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Now there our back steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the relationship goes sour for</v>

1440
01:26:59.481 --> 01:27:04.481
<v Speaker 1>awhile usually because Rasputin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a surreal misbehavior does </v>

1441
01:27:04.481 --> 01:27:06.950
<v Speaker 1>something particularly outrageous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either embarrassing the czar,</v>

1442
01:27:06.951 --> 01:27:11.951
<v Speaker 1>so much that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he does what his underlings are </v>

1443
01:27:11.951 --> 01:27:14.861
<v Speaker 1>continually telling them to do and sends</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rasputin a way or legitimately upsetting</v>

1444
01:27:14.901 --> 01:27:16.010
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless.</v>

1445
01:27:16.011 --> 01:27:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Every time he manages to break the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship breakup,</v>

1446
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:21.380
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could say with Rasputin </v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitably,</v>

1447
01:27:21.381 --> 01:27:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Alexi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his son,</v>

1448
01:27:22.491 --> 01:27:25.010
<v Speaker 1>the heir to the throne will get sick </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1449
01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:29.780
<v Speaker 1>necessitating a return of Rasputin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like a cigarette habit.</v>

1450
01:27:29.781 --> 01:27:30.590
<v Speaker 1>You can't kick</v>

1451
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:37.030
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This rescued and characters fascinating </v>

1452
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.030
<v Speaker 1>on so many levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1453
01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:41.021
<v Speaker 1>you have to think you were dealt some </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting cards by fate to be able to </v>

1454
01:27:41.021 --> 01:27:44.540
<v Speaker 1>parlay your gifts from his upbringing as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1455
01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:49.690
<v Speaker 1>as an uneducated peasant with no money </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of nowhere to where you </v>

1456
01:27:49.821 --> 01:27:52.130
<v Speaker 1>are in the royal family.</v>

1457
01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:57.160
<v Speaker 1>And when you see a picture of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see a little bit of it.</v>

1458
01:27:57.190 --> 01:27:59.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was five foot nine inches tall,</v>

1459
01:27:59.950 --> 01:28:01.870
<v Speaker 1>pretty normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1460
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:06.430
<v Speaker 1>he had dark black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oily hair parted in the middle,</v>

1461
01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:09.730
<v Speaker 1>unkempt mustache,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unkempt beard,</v>

1462
01:28:09.731 --> 01:28:11.170
<v Speaker 1>interesting way of dressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1463
01:28:11.171 --> 01:28:16.171
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had photo shopped his picture </v>

1464
01:28:16.171 --> 01:28:17.860
<v Speaker 1>onto the back of any number of 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies heavy metal albums,</v>

1465
01:28:18.010 --> 01:28:20.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I would be able to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bands photo on the back and,</v>

1466
01:28:21.010 --> 01:28:26.010
<v Speaker 1>and know that you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would have fit in perfectly as the </v>

1467
01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:26.010
<v Speaker 1>basis of any number of bands from back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

1468
01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Heck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he were a lead singer and you named </v>

1469
01:28:31.380 --> 01:28:31.840
<v Speaker 1>the band after him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would fit in on any lineup.</v>

1470
01:28:31.841 --> 01:28:34.390
<v Speaker 1>You could think of it as a heavy metal </v>
<v Speaker 1>festival winded.</v>

1471
01:28:34.391 --> 01:28:34.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1472
01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:37.360
<v Speaker 1>this weekend only black Sabbath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron maiden,</v>

1473
01:28:37.361 --> 01:28:42.361
<v Speaker 1>motorhead and Rasputin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had the most amazing eyes and you can</v>

1474
01:28:42.551 --> 01:28:46.780
<v Speaker 1>tell because normally you can't tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>from photos 100 years ago,</v>

1475
01:28:47.010 --> 01:28:48.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain qualities of individuals.</v>

1476
01:28:48.851 --> 01:28:51.520
<v Speaker 1>It just gets lost through the layers of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1477
01:28:51.650 --> 01:28:53.500
<v Speaker 1>of fuzziness and black and white and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1478
01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:58.740
<v Speaker 1>But if you catch the right photo of </v>
<v Speaker 1>respite and he had to be hand to be </v>

1479
01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:01.771
<v Speaker 1>caught just the right time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see what the eyes were like </v>

1480
01:29:01.771 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 1>because they jump of the black and white</v>

1481
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:07.010
<v Speaker 3>photo from 100 years ago at you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even now the whites of his eyes were </v>

1482
01:29:07.010 --> 01:29:09.180
<v Speaker 3>said by witnesses to be extra white and </v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1483
01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:14.240
<v Speaker 3>it kind of looks that way and some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the photos is eichler dazzle people to </v>

1484
01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:18.111
<v Speaker 3>the point where we have multiple </v>
<v Speaker 3>descriptions that all contradict each </v>

1485
01:29:18.111 --> 01:29:18.111
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people say blue,</v>

1486
01:29:18.111 --> 01:29:18.690
<v Speaker 3>some people say Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people say gray.</v>

1487
01:29:18.691 --> 01:29:23.691
<v Speaker 3>Some people say multicolored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you read about his sort of tick </v>

1488
01:29:24.251 --> 01:29:28.450
<v Speaker 3>like way of walking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>moving his nervous habits,</v>

1489
01:29:28.451 --> 01:29:30.760
<v Speaker 3>the way he wouldn't talk for a while and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then all of a sudden you get this,</v>

1490
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:36.030
<v Speaker 3>this stream of sometimes unrelated </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation spiced with sexual </v>

1491
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:40.621
<v Speaker 3>innuendos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a part of you that </v>

1492
01:29:40.621 --> 01:29:42.541
<v Speaker 3>thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I just read a book on the late </v>

1493
01:29:42.541 --> 01:29:42.541
<v Speaker 3>writer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hunter,</v>

1494
01:29:42.541 --> 01:29:42.541
<v Speaker 3>Thompson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sound like in a room together.</v>

1495
01:29:42.541 --> 01:29:43.960
<v Speaker 3>They would look like they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>impersonating each other.</v>

1496
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:50.030
<v Speaker 3>Rasputin is a combination of a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>who looks to be a very devout religious </v>

1497
01:29:52.501 --> 01:29:56.790
<v Speaker 3>figure from Russia's Christianity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Orthodox Christian,</v>

1498
01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:58.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a drunk and hell raiser.</v>

1499
01:30:00.030 --> 01:30:03.240
<v Speaker 3>And apparently that's not that unusual </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a,</v>

1500
01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:08.320
<v Speaker 3>in the Russian tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in the Siberian tradition </v>

1501
01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:08.320
<v Speaker 3>where Rasputin's from,</v>

1502
01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:13.360
<v Speaker 3>there are some offshoots and sex and </v>
<v Speaker 3>cults who had these interesting beliefs </v>

1503
01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.240
<v Speaker 3>and I don't understand them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't,</v>

1504
01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:19.360
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't try to explain them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently it involves needing to </v>

1505
01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:21.680
<v Speaker 3>sin sometimes in order to get the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of repentance working for you.</v>

1506
01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:24.860
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there are rumors of orgies that take</v>

1507
01:30:24.861 --> 01:30:26.900
<v Speaker 3>place as part of the rights for these </v>
<v Speaker 3>religions.</v>

1508
01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:28.640
<v Speaker 3>And some historians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not most,</v>

1509
01:30:28.641 --> 01:30:31.250
<v Speaker 3>but some have tied Rasputin to some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

1510
01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:36.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strange sex and strange beliefs and it </v>

1511
01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:36.600
<v Speaker 3>would make sense in one in one sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

1512
01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:40.961
<v Speaker 3>because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are conversations that have been </v>

1513
01:30:40.961 --> 01:30:40.961
<v Speaker 3>recorded with his wife and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was married,</v>

1514
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:42.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she would walk past him in,</v>

1515
01:30:42.611 --> 01:30:43.030
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1516
01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:46.130
<v Speaker 3>in the middle of a town with other women</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they would all see him having sex in</v>

1517
01:30:46.131 --> 01:30:47.870
<v Speaker 3>the open with some towns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>

1518
01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:49.520
<v Speaker 3>she would say something to the effect </v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1519
01:30:49.521 --> 01:30:51.080
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just his cross to bear.</v>

1520
01:30:51.290 --> 01:30:52.520
<v Speaker 3>He's got to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1521
01:30:52.521 --> 01:30:55.310
<v Speaker 3>Like he didn't want to just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has to do that.</v>

1522
01:30:55.311 --> 01:30:57.470
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's he's helping those people.</v>

1523
01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:01.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure if I was rescued and I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to sell it that way,</v>

1524
01:31:01.951 --> 01:31:02.730
<v Speaker 3>let's put it that way.</v>

1525
01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:08.520
<v Speaker 3>The to gossip column type offenses that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1526
01:31:08.521 --> 01:31:13.521
<v Speaker 3>he's always tarred with our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our extreme drunkenness and sexual </v>

1527
01:31:13.521 --> 01:31:18.111
<v Speaker 3>outrageousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And usually in combination with each </v>

1528
01:31:18.111 --> 01:31:18.111
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

1529
01:31:18.111 --> 01:31:22.890
<v Speaker 3>there are rape charges that are brought </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the czar in Zarina's attention were </v>

1530
01:31:22.890 --> 01:31:24.010
<v Speaker 3>the household staff is accusing him of </v>
<v Speaker 3>going after them.</v>

1531
01:31:24.250 --> 01:31:29.250
<v Speaker 3>He's absolutely brazen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He will sit down next to have a figure </v>

1532
01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:32.761
<v Speaker 3>from the royal family and put his arm </v>
<v Speaker 3>around her at a party with all the </v>

1533
01:31:32.761 --> 01:31:33.820
<v Speaker 3>aristocrats there and start moving in on</v>
<v Speaker 3>her.</v>

1534
01:31:34.330 --> 01:31:39.330
<v Speaker 3>There are stories that you have to know </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the Zaras arena knew he was this </v>

1535
01:31:39.330 --> 01:31:42.601
<v Speaker 3>way because at these family gatherings I</v>
<v Speaker 3>mentioned earlier where they're all </v>

1536
01:31:42.601 --> 01:31:42.601
<v Speaker 3>sitting there and it's just him and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>

1537
01:31:42.601 --> 01:31:47.461
<v Speaker 3>He'll sit next to the princesses who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>all adolescent girls during this time </v>

1538
01:31:47.461 --> 01:31:50.851
<v Speaker 3>period and they will jump up like </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been prompted with a hot needle </v>

1539
01:31:51.031 --> 01:31:55.840
<v Speaker 3>because he's goosing them and feeling </v>
<v Speaker 3>them in front of the czar and Zarina.</v>

1540
01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.070
<v Speaker 3>And yet at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1541
01:31:59.890 --> 01:32:00.190
<v Speaker 3>some</v>

1542
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:04.390
<v Speaker 1>of this stuff is passed off as just part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his rustic peasant charm.</v>

1543
01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it cute that he doesn't know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate that is?</v>

1544
01:32:07.570 --> 01:32:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these people in Russia's </v>

1545
01:32:12.570 --> 01:32:14.280
<v Speaker 1>aristocracy hated him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those who didn't kind of had a </v>

1546
01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:18.241
<v Speaker 1>reaction like he was some sort of exotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that the zoo brought in and you </v>

1547
01:32:18.241 --> 01:32:19.420
<v Speaker 1>have to make allowances for what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't understand.</v>

1548
01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.760
<v Speaker 1>He might not know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just walk up and touch them.</v>

1549
01:32:21.761 --> 01:32:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Noble Woman's breast at dinner and how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how funny and interesting it is at isn't</v>

1550
01:32:26.230 --> 01:32:27.130
<v Speaker 1>outrageous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1551
01:32:27.131 --> 01:32:28.510
<v Speaker 1>that kind of an attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1552
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:30.690
<v Speaker 1>but he was fun and historian Joseph </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fermin,</v>

1553
01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:33.100
<v Speaker 1>who's written two books on Rasputin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed that out,</v>

1554
01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:38.200
<v Speaker 1>quote Rasputin was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a pleasure to be in his company.</v>

1555
01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:42.220
<v Speaker 1>He gave people nicknames and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>often cutting and quite appropriate.</v>

1556
01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:46.150
<v Speaker 1>He might double a woman hot stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boss lady,</v>

1557
01:32:46.330 --> 01:32:51.330
<v Speaker 1>sexy girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or good looking while a man would be </v>

1558
01:32:51.330 --> 01:32:51.880
<v Speaker 1>called fancy pants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big breaches,</v>

1559
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.770
<v Speaker 1>long hair or fellow people accepted this</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a charming characteristic.</v>

1560
01:32:56.890 --> 01:33:00.610
<v Speaker 1>The humor of a peasant who meant no </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrespect and quote.</v>

1561
01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:05.130
<v Speaker 1>So the people that didn't hate Rasputin </v>
<v Speaker 1>would often,</v>

1562
01:33:05.490 --> 01:33:08.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overlook his outrageousness and consider</v>

1563
01:33:08.371 --> 01:33:09.400
<v Speaker 1>that part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1564
01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:13.380
<v Speaker 1>his charm is rustic peasant charm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

1565
01:33:13.381 --> 01:33:16.170
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it was a little too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even for the czar,</v>

1566
01:33:16.171 --> 01:33:19.050
<v Speaker 1>there's famous incidents and they all </v>
<v Speaker 1>end up in the local media.</v>

1567
01:33:19.051 --> 01:33:24.051
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia had a tabloid media during this </v>

1568
01:33:24.051 --> 01:33:25.440
<v Speaker 1>time period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Rasputin was one of their staple,</v>

1569
01:33:25.930 --> 01:33:26.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figures.</v>

1570
01:33:26.821 --> 01:33:27.900
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in my day,</v>

1571
01:33:28.530 --> 01:33:33.530
<v Speaker 1>every one of them had to have it </v>
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth Taylor story or a Michael </v>

1572
01:33:33.530 --> 01:33:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Jackson story or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim Kardashians,</v>

1573
01:33:34.801 --> 01:33:36.930
<v Speaker 1>probably today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then in Russia,</v>

1574
01:33:36.931 --> 01:33:39.060
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't have a respite in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

1575
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:40.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every so often,</v>

1576
01:33:40.770 --> 01:33:45.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean you were worried about </v>
<v Speaker 1>circulation dropping and just when you </v>

1577
01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:46.230
<v Speaker 1>think there'd be no new news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets roaring drunk in a,</v>

1578
01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:48.900
<v Speaker 1>in a Highfalutin restaurant in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital city.</v>

1579
01:33:49.050 --> 01:33:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Starts yelling about how he knows the </v>
<v Speaker 1>czar and then pulls his pants down and </v>

1580
01:33:54.050 --> 01:33:56.040
<v Speaker 1>whips his genitals out to the restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 1>word like that,</v>

1581
01:33:56.041 --> 01:33:57.900
<v Speaker 1>gets around in the tabloids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat it up.</v>

1582
01:33:57.901 --> 01:34:02.901
<v Speaker 1>At one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does our had to tell the tabloids that </v>

1583
01:34:02.901 --> 01:34:04.260
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't mention his name anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they just started referring to him as</v>

1584
01:34:04.261 --> 01:34:07.650
<v Speaker 1>the guy who lives on so and so street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever street he lived on.</v>

1585
01:34:07.890 --> 01:34:10.290
<v Speaker 1>And everyone in the public just knew who</v>
<v Speaker 1>they meant.</v>

1586
01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:17.780
<v Speaker 1>There were cartoons that made the rounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing Rasputin,</v>

1587
01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his hand on the naked breast of the</v>

1588
01:34:21.321 --> 01:34:26.321
<v Speaker 1>Zarina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>implying what a lot of people wondered </v>

1589
01:34:26.321 --> 01:34:29.231
<v Speaker 1>about this relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it's almost certainly not true </v>

1590
01:34:29.231 --> 01:34:31.250
<v Speaker 1>if Rasputin's going around town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping with everything that moves from</v>

1591
01:34:31.251 --> 01:34:35.600
<v Speaker 1>peasants to royal women as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's he doing with the Zarina?</v>

1592
01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:42.440
<v Speaker 1>There are even whisperings and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>public charge made that the</v>

1593
01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:47.750
<v Speaker 1>heir to the throne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Tsar's son is really Rasputin son.</v>

1594
01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Almost certainly not true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the more gossip circulated with that</v>

1595
01:34:51.921 --> 01:34:53.810
<v Speaker 1>kind of talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more it undermined,</v>

1596
01:34:54.530 --> 01:34:57.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's trust in the [inaudible] arena.</v>

1597
01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Remember this arena's already German at </v>
<v Speaker 1>a time when the Russian people are </v>

1598
01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:05.210
<v Speaker 1>hounding Russian generals who just have </v>
<v Speaker 1>German last names.</v>

1599
01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:10.540
<v Speaker 1>What happens if you are German and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] not around and this strange </v>

1600
01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Russian peasant who seems like a spin </v>
<v Speaker 1>golly is.</v>

1601
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were protests in 1915 where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people were saying down with respite</v>

1602
01:35:18.041 --> 01:35:22.550
<v Speaker 1>and down with Alexandra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not an unknown quantity.</v>

1603
01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Everyone realizes he's almost a public </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure.</v>

1604
01:35:25.190 --> 01:35:30.190
<v Speaker 1>They debate him in the legislature and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the powers that be want him gone.</v>

1605
01:35:30.650 --> 01:35:35.650
<v Speaker 1>There's a story during this time period </v>
<v Speaker 1>about one of the ways they tried to get </v>

1606
01:35:35.650 --> 01:35:37.910
<v Speaker 1>him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a famous story one day Rasputin.</v>

1607
01:35:37.911 --> 01:35:42.911
<v Speaker 1>Here's a knock at his door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes to the door and there's a man </v>

1608
01:35:42.911 --> 01:35:45.701
<v Speaker 1>standing there with a package and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives risks in the package and Rasputin </v>

1609
01:35:45.701 --> 01:35:49.601
<v Speaker 1>opens the package and it's full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>photos and Rasputin looks at the photos </v>

1610
01:35:49.601 --> 01:35:53.441
<v Speaker 1>and they are photos of him unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insensible due to drink,</v>

1611
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:57.050
<v Speaker 1>and there are naked women all around </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1612
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:58.610
<v Speaker 1>Night photos.</v>

1613
01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:05.180
<v Speaker 1>The man at the door who gave him the </v>
<v Speaker 1>package says either you leave town and </v>

1614
01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:08.901
<v Speaker 1>go back to where you came from and stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking and influencing the czar or </v>

1615
01:36:08.901 --> 01:36:09.060
<v Speaker 1>we're going to give these pictures to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1616
01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:15.200
<v Speaker 1>It was an extortion attempt and I'm one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the nights apparently that respite </v>

1617
01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:19.381
<v Speaker 1>and had passed out from drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His enemies had hired prostitutes and </v>

1618
01:36:19.381 --> 01:36:22.020
<v Speaker 1>position them around him naked and </v>
<v Speaker 1>started taking photos to blackmail him.</v>

1619
01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:25.050
<v Speaker 1>In typical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpected fashion.</v>

1620
01:36:25.051 --> 01:36:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Rasputin took the photos straight to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>czar and sort of,</v>

1621
01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:30.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>threw himself on the mercy of the court.</v>

1622
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Now a lot of the time Rasputin's able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>skate away with no real repercussions.</v>

1623
01:36:37.130 --> 01:36:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said,</v>

1624
01:36:39.411 --> 01:36:42.410
<v Speaker 1>occasional riffs would develop between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the czar and Rasputin.</v>

1625
01:36:42.710 --> 01:36:44.030
<v Speaker 1>One of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1626
01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:49.090
<v Speaker 1>that went on in 1912,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a perfect example of how hard it was </v>

1627
01:36:49.090 --> 01:36:51.110
<v Speaker 1>for the czar to stay away from Rasputin </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1912.</v>

1628
01:36:51.111 --> 01:36:56.111
<v Speaker 1>They have one of these disagreements on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the [inaudible] sends Rasputin back to </v>

1629
01:36:56.111 --> 01:36:59.321
<v Speaker 1>Siberia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The royal family goes on a vacation in </v>

1630
01:36:59.321 --> 01:36:59.810
<v Speaker 1>September,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1912 to their country palace.</v>

1631
01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:02.240
<v Speaker 1>They're playing around in the young heir</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the throne.</v>

1632
01:37:02.241 --> 01:37:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Lexi jumps in a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's about seven or eight years old.</v>

1633
01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Not Unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not unusual for seven or eight year old </v>

1634
01:37:10.570 --> 01:37:13.361
<v Speaker 1>to land wrong and hurt themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of these seven or eight year </v>

1635
01:37:13.361 --> 01:37:13.361
<v Speaker 1>olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1636
01:37:13.361 --> 01:37:15.320
<v Speaker 1>not hemophiliac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it instantly becomes a problem.</v>

1637
01:37:15.321 --> 01:37:17.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a giant Hematoma in his lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>abdomen.</v>

1638
01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:20.450
<v Speaker 1>They take them back to the palace and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a terrible scare.</v>

1639
01:37:21.110 --> 01:37:23.420
<v Speaker 1>He gets very ill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very bad.</v>

1640
01:37:23.690 --> 01:37:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes about a month for him to start </v>

1641
01:37:28.690 --> 01:37:30.491
<v Speaker 1>to recover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as he's just starting to turn the </v>

1642
01:37:30.491 --> 01:37:30.491
<v Speaker 1>corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've never understood this,</v>

1643
01:37:30.491 --> 01:37:30.860
<v Speaker 1>his mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's our arena,</v>

1644
01:37:30.861 --> 01:37:35.861
<v Speaker 1>thinks it'd be great to take them on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little carriage ride and it's a bumpy </v>

1645
01:37:35.861 --> 01:37:39.101
<v Speaker 1>road and they hit some bumps and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>cries out and pain and something's </v>

1646
01:37:39.101 --> 01:37:40.460
<v Speaker 1>happened inside him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take him back to the palace and now</v>

1647
01:37:40.461 --> 01:37:45.461
<v Speaker 1>they have one of the most horrific </v>
<v Speaker 1>periods of their life starting because </v>

1648
01:37:45.461 --> 01:37:50.351
<v Speaker 1>this kid starts to die and it takes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>while and it's very painful and the </v>

1649
01:37:51.111 --> 01:37:55.970
<v Speaker 1>parents are watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the kids fever skyrockets.</v>

1650
01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:01.160
<v Speaker 3>The pain becomes so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's delirious and slipping in and out </v>

1651
01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:03.560
<v Speaker 3>of consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read somewhere that a opium is used in</v>

1652
01:38:03.570 --> 01:38:06.080
<v Speaker 3>the past sometimes for people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>heir to the throne,</v>

1653
01:38:06.081 --> 01:38:07.740
<v Speaker 3>his condition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't use it for him.</v>

1654
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:11.820
<v Speaker 3>And the screams are so terrible that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're told the palace staff has to stuff</v>

1655
01:38:11.821 --> 01:38:14.100
<v Speaker 3>cotton in their ears to walk around to </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with it.</v>

1656
01:38:14.610 --> 01:38:15.990
<v Speaker 3>The parents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1657
01:38:15.991 --> 01:38:20.991
<v Speaker 3>loving real hands on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Parents take their turn at his bedside </v>

1658
01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:23.130
<v Speaker 3>and he's begging for help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1659
01:38:23.190 --> 01:38:24.240
<v Speaker 3>he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lord,</v>

1660
01:38:24.241 --> 01:38:29.241
<v Speaker 3>have mercy on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was one of the things recorded over and </v>

1661
01:38:29.241 --> 01:38:31.821
<v Speaker 3>over and over again and my mom helped me</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pain and we're told that when the </v>

1662
01:38:32.581 --> 01:38:34.560
<v Speaker 3>parents shifted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bedside was over,</v>

1663
01:38:34.561 --> 01:38:36.750
<v Speaker 3>they would walk out of the room and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>burst into tears.</v>

1664
01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:42.320
<v Speaker 3>The czar said that the Zarina handled </v>
<v Speaker 3>the ordeal better than he did at a </v>

1665
01:38:42.931 --> 01:38:45.060
<v Speaker 3>certain point that doctors run out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>things to do.</v>

1666
01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.610
<v Speaker 3>They tell the parents there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>more they can do.</v>

1667
01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:52.820
<v Speaker 3>It becomes apparent to the parents and </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the patient that he's dying and he </v>

1668
01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:56.730
<v Speaker 3>starts talking about those things that </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroy parents.</v>

1669
01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:58.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean that you never want to hear your </v>
<v Speaker 3>little kid saying he's.</v>

1670
01:38:58.880 --> 01:38:59.880
<v Speaker 3>He's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I die,</v>

1671
01:38:59.881 --> 01:39:03.990
<v Speaker 3>will the pain be gone to his mother?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He asked that after he dies,</v>

1672
01:39:03.991 --> 01:39:08.991
<v Speaker 3>they build this little shrine in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>woods for amount of stones and then the </v>

1673
01:39:08.991 --> 01:39:13.311
<v Speaker 3>reality of the situation sets in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they start putting together a public </v>

1674
01:39:13.311 --> 01:39:15.780
<v Speaker 3>statement to tell the Russian people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the heir to the throne has died.</v>

1675
01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:21.380
<v Speaker 3>The last rites are performed and while </v>
<v Speaker 3>at a meeting,</v>

1676
01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:25.530
<v Speaker 3>the czar gets a hand scrawled note from </v>
<v Speaker 3>his wife saying,</v>

1677
01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:29.160
<v Speaker 3>come quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's time the boy's about to die</v>

1678
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:34.790
<v Speaker 3>at the last minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Zarina pens and note to rest butte </v>

1679
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:39.111
<v Speaker 3>and often Siberia essentially saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>help and she gets a cable the next </v>

1680
01:39:39.111 --> 01:39:39.180
<v Speaker 3>morning.</v>

1681
01:39:39.210 --> 01:39:44.210
<v Speaker 3>It's a famous cable and it lets a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>air out of the tires that it's not as </v>

1682
01:39:44.210 --> 01:39:44.730
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>According to a historian,</v>

1683
01:39:44.731 --> 01:39:46.650
<v Speaker 3>Josef Herman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we always thought it was,</v>

1684
01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:52.100
<v Speaker 3>the cable was always thought to say God </v>
<v Speaker 3>has seen your tears and heard your </v>

1685
01:39:52.411 --> 01:39:54.240
<v Speaker 3>prayers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do not grieve.</v>

1686
01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:59.420
<v Speaker 3>The little one will not die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do not allow the doctors to bother him </v>

1687
01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:03.201
<v Speaker 3>too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And quote Russians during the Alexandra </v>

1688
01:40:03.410 --> 01:40:04.070
<v Speaker 3>Spring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1689
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:06.360
<v Speaker 3>apparently says there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were two notes,</v>

1690
01:40:06.361 --> 01:40:08.670
<v Speaker 3>but the one that was misquoted really </v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1691
01:40:08.671 --> 01:40:10.230
<v Speaker 3>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fear nothing.</v>

1692
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:12.810
<v Speaker 3>The illness is not as dangerous as </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're saying.</v>

1693
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:17.870
<v Speaker 3>See that the doctors do not bother him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by that afternoon the boy is out of </v>

1694
01:40:20.281 --> 01:40:23.280
<v Speaker 3>pain and is able to sleep and the fever </v>
<v Speaker 3>starts dropping.</v>

1695
01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:26.400
<v Speaker 3>The doctors are stunned and it should be</v>
<v Speaker 3>pointed out.</v>

1696
01:40:26.401 --> 01:40:28.950
<v Speaker 3>They hate Rasputin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were forced.</v>

1697
01:40:28.951 --> 01:40:33.951
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's several of them quoted in the </v>

1698
01:40:33.951 --> 01:40:33.951
<v Speaker 3>infirmary [inaudible] latest book.</v>

1699
01:40:33.951 --> 01:40:34.290
<v Speaker 3>He's written two books on Rasputin and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just,</v>

1700
01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:39.980
<v Speaker 3>they don't know what to even make of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it wasn't just this time they would </v>

1701
01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:43.491
<v Speaker 3>be trying to stop the boy from bleeding </v>
<v Speaker 3>and past incidents and Rasputin would </v>

1702
01:40:43.491 --> 01:40:47.211
<v Speaker 3>come up and they would watch him stop it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and historians have been trying to find </v>

1703
01:40:47.211 --> 01:40:49.260
<v Speaker 3>explanations for this ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1704
01:40:49.261 --> 01:40:54.261
<v Speaker 3>I've heard everything from hypnosis to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the power of suggestion to drugs to one </v>

1705
01:40:55.331 --> 01:40:59.110
<v Speaker 3>theory is that that they were giving the</v>
<v Speaker 3>young czar aspirin,</v>

1706
01:40:59.111 --> 01:41:04.111
<v Speaker 3>which was like the new wonder drug back </v>
<v Speaker 3>then and that of course would have been </v>

1707
01:41:04.111 --> 01:41:06.811
<v Speaker 3>the worst thing to give them and when </v>
<v Speaker 3>respite and says don't let the doctors </v>

1708
01:41:06.811 --> 01:41:07.300
<v Speaker 3>bothered him too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stopped giving him the Asprin.</v>

1709
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:12.750
<v Speaker 3>Some people have suggested that there </v>
<v Speaker 3>were some potion Rasputin had the sort </v>

1710
01:41:12.750 --> 01:41:12.940
<v Speaker 3>of kept the boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1711
01:41:12.941 --> 01:41:14.830
<v Speaker 3>in a bad state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anytime he wanted to,</v>

1712
01:41:15.050 --> 01:41:20.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put a little emotional pressure on the </v>

1713
01:41:20.050 --> 01:41:20.050
<v Speaker 3>royal family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all kinds of theories,</v>

1714
01:41:20.050 --> 01:41:23.200
<v Speaker 3>but if you're the Zarina and you've </v>
<v Speaker 3>already seen respite and save your son's</v>

1715
01:41:23.201 --> 01:41:28.201
<v Speaker 3>life several times and he just pulled </v>
<v Speaker 3>him back from the brink of death by </v>

1716
01:41:28.201 --> 01:41:32.551
<v Speaker 3>telegram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you think you'd stop caring about </v>

1717
01:41:32.551 --> 01:41:36.490
<v Speaker 3>the wherefores and the what ifs and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>not want this guy to leave your side.</v>

1718
01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:43.580
<v Speaker 3>If the czar of Russia was in the process</v>
<v Speaker 3>of kicking his respite and habit,</v>

1719
01:41:43.581 --> 01:41:46.910
<v Speaker 3>he fell off the wagon after that 1912,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1720
01:41:46.911 --> 01:41:49.220
<v Speaker 3>pull your son back from the brink of </v>
<v Speaker 3>death moment.</v>

1721
01:41:51.050 --> 01:41:51.980
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing,</v>

1722
01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:58.400
<v Speaker 3>Rasputin wasn't a problem because he </v>
<v Speaker 3>kept healing the heir to the throne.</v>

1723
01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:04.420
<v Speaker 3>If he had stuck to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably we don't even talk about him </v>

1724
01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:04.760
<v Speaker 3>very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

1725
01:42:04.761 --> 01:42:07.190
<v Speaker 3>the reason we do talk about and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason he's a famous figure,</v>

1726
01:42:07.191 --> 01:42:12.191
<v Speaker 3>the reason half of Russia wants him dead</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because he's not sticking to fixing </v>

1727
01:42:12.191 --> 01:42:16.151
<v Speaker 3>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's meddling in policy in a funny way </v>

1728
01:42:16.151 --> 01:42:17.590
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see how that happened.</v>

1729
01:42:17.890 --> 01:42:19.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm not so appalled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1730
01:42:19.150 --> 01:42:19.810
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

1731
01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:24.840
<v Speaker 3>if you look at this from the czar as our</v>
<v Speaker 3>arenas vantage point and you think this </v>

1732
01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:28.711
<v Speaker 3>guy has something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does arena thinks he's a man of God and </v>

1733
01:42:28.711 --> 01:42:31.851
<v Speaker 3>that God favors him and all the in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>prophetic and if you'd seen what she'd </v>

1734
01:42:31.851 --> 01:42:32.050
<v Speaker 3>seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you think?</v>

1735
01:42:32.051 --> 01:42:36.310
<v Speaker 3>So maybe to win if you thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't you want to use this guy like a</v>

1736
01:42:36.311 --> 01:42:41.311
<v Speaker 3>magic eight ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with the stakes as high as </v>

1737
01:42:41.311 --> 01:42:42.830
<v Speaker 3>they are for the czar at this time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1738
01:42:42.831 --> 01:42:46.220
<v Speaker 3>when the first world war breaks out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the Romanov Dynasty is threatened,</v>

1739
01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:49.730
<v Speaker 3>when millions of lives hinge on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision the Zar makes,</v>

1740
01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:51.710
<v Speaker 3>how tempting would it be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1741
01:42:51.711 --> 01:42:56.711
<v Speaker 3>to just sort of ask Rasputin what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought about disappointment or that </v>

1742
01:42:56.711 --> 01:43:01.481
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should I go to the front end to command </v>

1743
01:43:01.481 --> 01:43:01.481
<v Speaker 3>from the front line sources?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say Yes.</v>

1744
01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:04.290
<v Speaker 3>And that's the event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

1745
01:43:04.530 --> 01:43:06.780
<v Speaker 3>the czar going to command at the front </v>
<v Speaker 3>lines,</v>

1746
01:43:07.110 --> 01:43:12.090
<v Speaker 3>which opens up the door to turbo </v>
<v Speaker 3>charging Rasputin's influence and really</v>

1747
01:43:12.091 --> 01:43:16.680
<v Speaker 3>ushering Russia into the terminal phase </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the end of the Romanov Dynasty.</v>

1748
01:43:16.681 --> 01:43:19.740
<v Speaker 3>Because what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the terrible losses against the</v>

1749
01:43:20.130 --> 01:43:22.050
<v Speaker 3>central powers that the Russians had </v>
<v Speaker 3>suffered.</v>

1750
01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:27.780
<v Speaker 3>The czar thought that people might need </v>
<v Speaker 3>a scapegoat and he altruistically </v>

1751
01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:29.460
<v Speaker 3>offered himself up as a sacrificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>lamb.</v>

1752
01:43:29.610 --> 01:43:34.610
<v Speaker 3>He thinks he's going to go to the front.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His advisors think this is a terrible </v>

1753
01:43:34.610 --> 01:43:34.610
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would lots of downsides,</v>

1754
01:43:34.610 --> 01:43:37.020
<v Speaker 3>but Rasputin likes the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Therefore,</v>

1755
01:43:37.021 --> 01:43:37.650
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those aren't.</v>

1756
01:43:37.651 --> 01:43:42.651
<v Speaker 3>Rena likes the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At one point the Zaras wavering and </v>

1757
01:43:42.651 --> 01:43:45.141
<v Speaker 3>things maybe he shouldn't do it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rasputin bolsters his confidence that </v>

1758
01:43:45.141 --> 01:43:48.411
<v Speaker 3>it's a good idea and so the czar leaves </v>
<v Speaker 3>the capital and goes to Kinda close to </v>

1759
01:43:48.411 --> 01:43:51.260
<v Speaker 3>the front lines and all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's our arenas left in charge of day</v>

1760
01:43:51.261 --> 01:43:52.310
<v Speaker 3>to day activities</v>

1761
01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:55.730
<v Speaker 1>and she's using rest Putin like a magic </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight ball,</v>

1762
01:43:55.731 --> 01:43:56.870
<v Speaker 1>like you wouldn't believe.</v>

1763
01:43:58.970 --> 01:44:03.970
<v Speaker 1>You can read it in the letters back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth between the tsar and his wife </v>

1764
01:44:03.970 --> 01:44:03.970
<v Speaker 1>because she'll inform them what's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1765
01:44:03.970 --> 01:44:07.250
<v Speaker 1>She calls Rasputin our friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your little code name for him.</v>

1766
01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:10.430
<v Speaker 1>And she'll say to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are our friend thinks we should do this.</v>

1767
01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Our friend doesn't like that legislator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our friend thinks that appointment job </v>

1768
01:44:15.490 --> 01:44:17.780
<v Speaker 1>should go to this person and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate it back and forth and Rasputin is</v>

1769
01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:23.080
<v Speaker 1>making huge decisions for Russia's </v>
<v Speaker 1>future in war time when things are </v>

1770
01:44:23.211 --> 01:44:27.660
<v Speaker 1>deteriorating badly and bread riots are </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and and and dissatisfaction is</v>

1771
01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:32.680
<v Speaker 1>palpably on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rise and demonstrations are </v>

1772
01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:34.170
<v Speaker 1>occurring and he's drinking 12 bottles </v>
<v Speaker 1>of wine a day at wake up.</v>

1773
01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:41.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the belligerent powers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other countries aren't aware of it </v>

1774
01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:42.400
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British secret service is monitoring</v>

1775
01:44:42.401 --> 01:44:44.880
<v Speaker 1>according to historians like Joseph </v>
<v Speaker 1>Herman,</v>

1776
01:44:45.310 --> 01:44:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Monitoring Rasputin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a nickname for him,</v>

1777
01:44:48.041 --> 01:44:53.041
<v Speaker 1>a code name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call them dark forces and many </v>

1778
01:44:53.041 --> 01:44:53.710
<v Speaker 1>things about Rasputin troubled and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not sure.</v>

1779
01:44:53.711 --> 01:44:56.350
<v Speaker 1>He's not a German agent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think he's unstable.</v>

1780
01:44:56.351 --> 01:45:01.351
<v Speaker 1>Certainly they think he is in favor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of peace deal to get rushed </v>

1781
01:45:01.351 --> 01:45:06.321
<v Speaker 1>out of the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of reasons they don't </v>

1782
01:45:06.321 --> 01:45:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Kinda like him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this problem is becoming acute and</v>

1783
01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:13.400
<v Speaker 1>some nobleman apparently take it upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to read Russia of this </v>

1784
01:45:13.591 --> 01:45:15.660
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the way they see risks.</v>

1785
01:45:15.661 --> 01:45:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Putin that decided to kill him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when we reached this point,</v>

1786
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:24.250
<v Speaker 1>we're actually caught up with the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>timeline again.</v>

1787
01:45:24.580 --> 01:45:29.580
<v Speaker 1>It's December 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>16 where we left off before our little </v>

1788
01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Russian digression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1789
01:45:29.981 --> 01:45:34.981
<v Speaker 1>that time with the submarines and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>peace deals on the table and the </v>

1790
01:45:34.981 --> 01:45:36.340
<v Speaker 1>questions about the US getting into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war or not.</v>

1791
01:45:37.150 --> 01:45:38.550
<v Speaker 1>In December,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

1792
01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:43.580
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rumors are flying and the capital that </v>

1793
01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Rasputin is going to be killed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so pervasive.</v>

1794
01:45:47.690 --> 01:45:51.020
<v Speaker 1>Rasputin hears them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegedly has children,</v>

1795
01:45:51.021 --> 01:45:53.300
<v Speaker 1>hear them do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they hide his clothes so he can't go</v>

1796
01:45:53.301 --> 01:45:55.460
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

1797
01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:58.730
<v Speaker 1>even with those rumors flying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't resist.</v>

1798
01:45:58.731 --> 01:46:03.731
<v Speaker 1>And this is the traditional story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a Kennedy assassination type </v>

1799
01:46:03.731 --> 01:46:03.950
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Good Luck finding the truth.</v>

1800
01:46:03.951 --> 01:46:06.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm just giving you the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most common story here.</v>

1801
01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Apparently a nobleman offers his wife to</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest Butin,</v>

1802
01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:15.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nice little clandestine arrangement,</v>

1803
01:46:15.551 --> 01:46:17.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after a party or something like that.</v>

1804
01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Rasputin takes the guy up on the offer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a nobleman.</v>

1805
01:46:20.831 --> 01:46:25.831
<v Speaker 1>Felix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw Paul is his name and I think </v>

1806
01:46:25.831 --> 01:46:27.901
<v Speaker 1>he's so rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has more money than the ruling </v>

1807
01:46:27.901 --> 01:46:27.901
<v Speaker 1>dynasty and he's working with a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other men.</v>

1808
01:46:27.901 --> 01:46:32.681
<v Speaker 1>It's a true conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows how deeply there are some </v>

1809
01:46:32.681 --> 01:46:32.890
<v Speaker 1>who think the British secret service was</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in on it.</v>

1810
01:46:33.370 --> 01:46:38.370
<v Speaker 1>The majority don't you stop off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meets Rasputin kind of at his door,</v>

1811
01:46:38.591 --> 01:46:43.591
<v Speaker 1>brings him down into the basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Yankee doodle to tie this story </v>

1812
01:46:43.591 --> 01:46:47.290
<v Speaker 1>together wonderfully is playing on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phonograph upstairs that they can hear.</v>

1813
01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:50.340
<v Speaker 1>So you get this little American playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this story</v>

1814
01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:55.340
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a Russia reaches the terminal phase </v>

1815
01:46:55.340 --> 01:46:56.300
<v Speaker 3>here in the Romanov Dynasty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1816
01:46:56.610 --> 01:46:58.320
<v Speaker 3>there's food on the table,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's wine.</v>

1817
01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:01.350
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rendezvous is a little pushed back.</v>

1818
01:47:01.351 --> 01:47:06.351
<v Speaker 3>You saw Bob says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they sit there and they eat the food </v>

1819
01:47:06.351 --> 01:47:06.870
<v Speaker 3>and they drink the wine and after a </v>
<v Speaker 3>while you stop off,</v>

1820
01:47:06.871 --> 01:47:11.871
<v Speaker 3>begins to freak out because he's laced </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these things with cyanide.</v>

1821
01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:14.780
<v Speaker 3>And this guy's not dying.</v>

1822
01:47:16.330 --> 01:47:21.330
<v Speaker 3>He says he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his throat's bothering him a little in </v>

1823
01:47:21.330 --> 01:47:21.330
<v Speaker 3>his stomach's bothering him a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>

1824
01:47:21.330 --> 01:47:24.040
<v Speaker 3>he's sitting there drinking more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating more than asking you so pumped to</v>

1825
01:47:24.041 --> 01:47:26.110
<v Speaker 3>sing for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked your singing voice,</v>

1826
01:47:26.350 --> 01:47:27.820
<v Speaker 3>you so bob,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he excuses himself,</v>

1827
01:47:27.821 --> 01:47:30.580
<v Speaker 3>goes upstairs to where the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspirators are and freaks out.</v>

1828
01:47:30.581 --> 01:47:32.530
<v Speaker 3>What are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finally,</v>

1829
01:47:32.531 --> 01:47:34.040
<v Speaker 3>one of them decides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1830
01:47:34.270 --> 01:47:36.940
<v Speaker 3>they should shoot him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And [inaudible] got a pistol so you soap</v>

1831
01:47:36.941 --> 01:47:37.840
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes down there,</v>

1832
01:47:37.930 --> 01:47:41.170
<v Speaker 3>tells 'em Rasputin to look at something </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the wall over there.</v>

1833
01:47:41.290 --> 01:47:41.970
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1834
01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:44.200
<v Speaker 3>when Rasputin turns around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pistols pointed at him,</v>

1835
01:47:44.350 --> 01:47:45.490
<v Speaker 3>you saw Paul says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

1836
01:47:45.491 --> 01:47:47.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say your prayers or something like that,</v>

1837
01:47:47.291 --> 01:47:50.350
<v Speaker 3>shot him in the chest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He screams and he falls down on the rug,</v>

1838
01:47:50.351 --> 01:47:52.390
<v Speaker 3>frothing at the mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>convulsions dies.</v>

1839
01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:57.500
<v Speaker 3>The assassins all come downstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a look at the body,</v>

1840
01:47:57.501 --> 01:47:58.430
<v Speaker 3>the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1841
01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:02.090
<v Speaker 3>Go upstairs to commiserate about it for </v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>

1842
01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:04.340
<v Speaker 3>And then we're told that the assassin </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself off,</v>

1843
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:08.860
<v Speaker 3>wants to have another look at the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he goes downstairs and,</v>

1844
01:48:08.861 --> 01:48:13.861
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just affirming the historian quoting </v>

1845
01:48:13.861 --> 01:48:15.761
<v Speaker 3>some original sources in his quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talks about what happened when you soap </v>

1846
01:48:15.761 --> 01:48:19.841
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went down there to just make sure that </v>

1847
01:48:19.841 --> 01:48:20.150
<v Speaker 3>nothing wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Miss Thurman writes,</v>

1848
01:48:20.151 --> 01:48:25.151
<v Speaker 3>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he found Rasputin lying in the same </v>

1849
01:48:25.151 --> 01:48:26.960
<v Speaker 3>position on the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Overcome with a terrible inner rage,</v>

1850
01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:29.630
<v Speaker 3>you soap up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grabbed Rasputin by the shoulders,</v>

1851
01:48:29.631 --> 01:48:32.420
<v Speaker 3>and shook him as he stared into </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rasputin's face.</v>

1852
01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:36.980
<v Speaker 3>First one I and then the others suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 3>opened and then the source he's quoting,</v>

1853
01:48:36.981 --> 01:48:41.720
<v Speaker 3>says greenish and snake I'd they fixed </v>
<v Speaker 3>the prince with an expression of satanic</v>

1854
01:48:41.721 --> 01:48:44.330
<v Speaker 3>hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rasputin stumbled to his feet,</v>

1855
01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:46.970
<v Speaker 3>foaming at the mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>roaring and anger,</v>

1856
01:48:46.971 --> 01:48:48.830
<v Speaker 3>and wildly clawing at the air.</v>

1857
01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:52.160
<v Speaker 3>As he rushed towards you soph off blood </v>
<v Speaker 3>dripping from his mouth,</v>

1858
01:48:52.250 --> 01:48:56.420
<v Speaker 3>he grabbed the prince by the shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ripping an epithet from his uniform.</v>

1859
01:48:56.630 --> 01:48:59.990
<v Speaker 3>Rasputin was reportedly groundling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his tormentors name,</v>

1860
01:48:59.991 --> 01:49:04.940
<v Speaker 3>and a low guttural voice and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a Zombie.</v>

1861
01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:10.420
<v Speaker 3>And you soap office screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean everybody runs downstairs when </v>

1862
01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:11.240
<v Speaker 3>they hear this struggle going on and use</v>
<v Speaker 3>up of a screaming.</v>

1863
01:49:11.241 --> 01:49:12.710
<v Speaker 3>And by the time everybody gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>downstairs,</v>

1864
01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:18.160
<v Speaker 3>Rasputin has lurched into the snowbound </v>
<v Speaker 3>courtyard in his running away and he's </v>

1865
01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:20.150
<v Speaker 3>yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you so offs first name,</v>

1866
01:49:20.151 --> 01:49:23.360
<v Speaker 3>who's also the prince.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Prince yourself of Felix Felix.</v>

1867
01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:26.260
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll read everything you know he's going</v>

1868
01:49:26.261 --> 01:49:29.510
<v Speaker 3>to tattle on the prince for trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kill him.</v>

1869
01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:34.930
<v Speaker 3>And people opened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fire the prince among others at </v>

1870
01:49:34.930 --> 01:49:35.390
<v Speaker 3>Rasputin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as he flees Mrs a couple times,</v>

1871
01:49:35.391 --> 01:49:40.391
<v Speaker 3>then hits him somewhere in the back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they run up to the body that's on </v>

1872
01:49:40.391 --> 01:49:41.990
<v Speaker 3>the ground and they put a bullet through</v>
<v Speaker 3>his forehead.</v>

1873
01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:45.700
<v Speaker 3>Then we're told they wrap him up in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tie them up,</v>

1874
01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:48.160
<v Speaker 3>then wrap him up in a carpet than go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>a nearby</v>

1875
01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:52.510
<v Speaker 1>river where there's ice and throw them </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a hole on the ice and you know,</v>

1876
01:49:52.511 --> 01:49:55.840
<v Speaker 1>hope floats to Finland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course he doesn't.</v>

1877
01:49:56.380 --> 01:50:01.380
<v Speaker 1>They find him in a few days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They dragged the body out and and the </v>

1878
01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:01.380
<v Speaker 1>myth of this story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

1879
01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:05.110
<v Speaker 1>it's so much better with the myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that during the autopsy,</v>

1880
01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:10.440
<v Speaker 1>they found water in his lungs and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>body untied as though he had freed </v>

1881
01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:13.300
<v Speaker 1>himself and only at the end drown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the cyanide edema didn't work.</v>

1882
01:50:13.301 --> 01:50:15.160
<v Speaker 1>They shot him multiple times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work.</v>

1883
01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:17.620
<v Speaker 1>They threw him in the river and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost didn't work.</v>

1884
01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Historians say that the shot to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>forehead almost certainly killed him.</v>

1885
01:50:23.351 --> 01:50:24.790
<v Speaker 1>It's right in the middle of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>forehead.</v>

1886
01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:31.150
<v Speaker 1>And it's possible that the cyanide was </v>
<v Speaker 1>old or that never got put in his drinks,</v>

1887
01:50:31.390 --> 01:50:34.660
<v Speaker 1>or who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it adds to the legend of Rasputin.</v>

1888
01:50:35.970 --> 01:50:39.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a warning before he dies that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives to the royal family.</v>

1889
01:50:39.541 --> 01:50:42.600
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That also adds to his legend.</v>

1890
01:50:43.170 --> 01:50:45.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another one of these prophecies that are</v>

1891
01:50:45.121 --> 01:50:49.800
<v Speaker 1>sometimes uncannily correctly supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have said to the royal couple quote,</v>

1892
01:50:50.220 --> 01:50:54.810
<v Speaker 1>if I die or you desert me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will lose your son and your crown in</v>

1893
01:50:54.811 --> 01:50:55.770
<v Speaker 1>six months.</v>

1894
01:50:57.350 --> 01:51:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Rasputin is right again from beyond the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grave.</v>

1895
01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:11.120
<v Speaker 1>This period in the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his timeline about the time period </v>

1896
01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Rasputin dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1897
01:51:12.751 --> 01:51:14.850
<v Speaker 1>take a couple of months before he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>assassinated,</v>

1898
01:51:14.851 --> 01:51:19.851
<v Speaker 1>a couple of months afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That really is the first world war is </v>

1899
01:51:19.851 --> 01:51:20.130
<v Speaker 1>crowded our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1900
01:51:20.131 --> 01:51:23.580
<v Speaker 1>that's what Theodore Roosevelt called </v>
<v Speaker 1>his combat in the Spanish American war.</v>

1901
01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:28.020
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to describe these large </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of events that was crammed into a</v>

1902
01:51:28.021 --> 01:51:30.000
<v Speaker 1>short period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said it was his crowded,</v>

1903
01:51:30.001 --> 01:51:33.120
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the period from about November 19,</v>

1904
01:51:33.121 --> 01:51:36.660
<v Speaker 1>16 to April 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17 is the first world war was crowded.</v>

1905
01:51:36.661 --> 01:51:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Our huge number of events compressed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a short period of time.</v>

1906
01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:46.580
<v Speaker 1>These events are all connected though to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the various themes we've examined </v>

1907
01:51:46.580 --> 01:51:50.961
<v Speaker 1>individually so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States and the United States </v>

1908
01:51:50.961 --> 01:51:51.300
<v Speaker 1>involvement in Mexico,</v>

1909
01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:57.840
<v Speaker 1>the submarines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the high level diplomatic activity and </v>

1910
01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:01.471
<v Speaker 1>maneuvering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the train wreck that's about to </v>

1911
01:52:01.471 --> 01:52:02.950
<v Speaker 1>happen with Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This all comes to a head,</v>

1912
01:52:02.951 --> 01:52:06.250
<v Speaker 1>as we said in January,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late January 19,</v>

1913
01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:11.260
<v Speaker 1>17.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woodrow Wilson gives his peace without </v>

1914
01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:11.740
<v Speaker 1>victory speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While he's doing that,</v>

1915
01:52:12.310 --> 01:52:17.310
<v Speaker 1>the Germans are already behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes prepping for their February first</v>

1916
01:52:18.461 --> 01:52:23.461
<v Speaker 1>resumption of unrestricted warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've pulled the trigger on that </v>

1917
01:52:23.461 --> 01:52:27.301
<v Speaker 1>because they had given the high level </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians in Germany the go ahead to </v>

1918
01:52:27.431 --> 01:52:29.680
<v Speaker 1>try some peace maneuvering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1919
01:52:29.681 --> 01:52:34.681
<v Speaker 1>they were told that the peace </v>
<v Speaker 1>maneuvering doesn't when we let the </v>

1920
01:52:34.681 --> 01:52:36.370
<v Speaker 1>submarines go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the submarines are slated to go February</v>

1921
01:52:36.371 --> 01:52:41.371
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1917 now because Germany was reasonably </v>

1922
01:52:43.481 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 1>sure as was everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much</v>

1923
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:49.940
<v Speaker 3>that if they started shooting at every </v>
<v Speaker 3>ship on the high seas,</v>

1924
01:52:50.030 --> 01:52:55.030
<v Speaker 3>the United States was going to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>dragged into the war because Americans </v>

1925
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.030
<v Speaker 3>would die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>American ships would go down.</v>

1926
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:59.860
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty much inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Germans started working on some </v>

1927
01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:01.520
<v Speaker 3>contingency plans in January 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>17,</v>

1928
01:53:01.690 --> 01:53:02.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1929
01:53:02.301 --> 01:53:07.301
<v Speaker 3>right around the same time Wilson's </v>
<v Speaker 3>proposing piece for all men and all his </v>

1930
01:53:07.301 --> 01:53:10.601
<v Speaker 3>high minded sentiments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Germans are sending a telegram to </v>

1931
01:53:11.421 --> 01:53:16.421
<v Speaker 3>their ambassador in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving their ambassador in Mexico some </v>

1932
01:53:16.421 --> 01:53:20.681
<v Speaker 3>instructions on what to do just in case </v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States comes into the war and</v>

1933
01:53:21.411 --> 01:53:26.411
<v Speaker 3>starts fighting Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The telegram from the German foreign </v>

1934
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:33.070
<v Speaker 3>secretary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy named Arthur Zimmerman to the </v>

1935
01:53:33.070 --> 01:53:35.840
<v Speaker 3>ambassador of Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>says this quote,</v>

1936
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:39.020
<v Speaker 3>we intend to begin on the first of </v>
<v Speaker 3>February,</v>

1937
01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:44.200
<v Speaker 3>unrestricted submarine warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We shall endeavor in spite of this to </v>

1938
01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:45.380
<v Speaker 3>keep the United States of America </v>
<v Speaker 3>neutral.</v>

1939
01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:50.680
<v Speaker 3>In the event of this not succeeding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we make Mexico a proposal of alliance on</v>

1940
01:53:50.841 --> 01:53:53.330
<v Speaker 3>the following basis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make war together,</v>

1941
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:58.510
<v Speaker 3>make peace together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>generous financial support and an </v>

1942
01:53:58.510 --> 01:54:01.661
<v Speaker 3>understanding on our part that Mexico is</v>
<v Speaker 3>to reconquer the last territory in </v>

1943
01:54:01.661 --> 01:54:04.190
<v Speaker 3>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Mexico and Arizona.</v>

1944
01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:09.580
<v Speaker 3>The settlement in detail is left to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You will inform the president of the </v>

1945
01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:13.451
<v Speaker 3>above most secretly as soon as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>outbreak of war with the United States </v>

1946
01:54:13.451 --> 01:54:16.070
<v Speaker 3>of America is certain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And add the suggestion that he should on</v>

1947
01:54:16.071 --> 01:54:21.071
<v Speaker 3>his own initiative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>invite Japan to immediate adherence and </v>

1948
01:54:21.071 --> 01:54:23.000
<v Speaker 3>at the same time mediate between Japan </v>
<v Speaker 3>and ourselves.</v>

1949
01:54:23.330 --> 01:54:27.140
<v Speaker 3>Please call the president attention to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that the ruthless employment of</v>

1950
01:54:27.141 --> 01:54:32.141
<v Speaker 3>our submarines now offers the prospect </v>
<v Speaker 3>of compelling England in a few months to</v>

1951
01:54:32.241 --> 01:54:34.010
<v Speaker 3>make peace and quote.</v>

1952
01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:41.100
<v Speaker 3>So there's a note suggesting that Mexico</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to war as part of the central powers </v>

1953
01:54:41.951 --> 01:54:44.500
<v Speaker 3>against the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the United States gets into the war,</v>

1954
01:54:44.710 --> 01:54:49.710
<v Speaker 3>what's more?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They talk about getting Japan on board </v>

1955
01:54:49.710 --> 01:54:52.981
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the United States is </v>

1956
01:54:52.981 --> 01:54:52.981
<v Speaker 3>great worries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>

1957
01:54:52.981 --> 01:54:54.760
<v Speaker 3>The Japanese had scared the Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all these theories from American</v>

1958
01:54:54.761 --> 01:54:59.761
<v Speaker 3>planners that maybe they could go take </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Panama Canal and come up through </v>

1959
01:54:59.761 --> 01:55:00.700
<v Speaker 3>Mexico mean there's all these war plan </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of fantasies,</v>

1960
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:06.030
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that Japan could be brought</v>
<v Speaker 3>in and flipped because they're on the </v>

1961
01:55:06.030 --> 01:55:10.531
<v Speaker 3>allied side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Germans are talking about flipping </v>

1962
01:55:10.531 --> 01:55:12.481
<v Speaker 3>the Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making them on the central powers to </v>

1963
01:55:12.481 --> 01:55:12.481
<v Speaker 3>having the Japanese attack the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans,</v>

1964
01:55:12.481 --> 01:55:14.470
<v Speaker 3>the Mexicans attack the Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If nothing else,</v>

1965
01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:19.740
<v Speaker 3>that keeps the Americans busy so they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not over there fighting Germans in </v>

1966
01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:19.740
<v Speaker 3>Europe.</v>

1967
01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:25.760
<v Speaker 3>If you're playing a board game here of </v>
<v Speaker 3>risk or something that's not a bad idea,</v>

1968
01:55:26.041 --> 01:55:27.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a game called diplomacy.</v>

1969
01:55:27.301 --> 01:55:30.120
<v Speaker 3>Not a bad move if you're playing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>game called diplomacy,</v>

1970
01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:32.760
<v Speaker 3>proud ms dot all kinds of variables in </v>
<v Speaker 3>real life,</v>

1971
01:55:33.090 --> 01:55:35.670
<v Speaker 3>not taken into account in the game of </v>
<v Speaker 3>diplomacy.</v>

1972
01:55:35.671 --> 01:55:40.671
<v Speaker 3>One of them is that your enemies might </v>
<v Speaker 3>be tapping into the cable that you use </v>

1973
01:55:40.921 --> 01:55:45.450
<v Speaker 3>to send a secret message like from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany to Mexico.</v>

1974
01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:51.440
<v Speaker 3>The British got it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>snatched it right off of the American </v>

1975
01:55:52.770 --> 01:55:55.170
<v Speaker 3>Atlantic cable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they were tapping.</v>

1976
01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:59.430
<v Speaker 3>I think we mentioned in an earlier </v>
<v Speaker 3>episode that British may be the,</v>

1977
01:55:59.490 --> 01:56:03.810
<v Speaker 3>the best espionage code breaker people </v>
<v Speaker 3>of all time.</v>

1978
01:56:04.710 --> 01:56:09.710
<v Speaker 3>When the war starts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they cut the German transatlantic </v>

1979
01:56:09.710 --> 01:56:09.710
<v Speaker 3>cables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1980
01:56:09.710 --> 01:56:10.590
<v Speaker 3>Germany can't send telegraph messages </v>
<v Speaker 3>across the Atlantic.</v>

1981
01:56:10.770 --> 01:56:13.950
<v Speaker 3>So they work out deals to borrow other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's cable.</v>

1982
01:56:13.951 --> 01:56:18.951
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes the United States let them use</v>
<v Speaker 3>the US cable for just messages.</v>

1983
01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:22.530
<v Speaker 3>Woodrow Wilson thought would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would maybe foster peace,</v>

1984
01:56:22.531 --> 01:56:27.531
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wants to the Germans to have an open </v>

1985
01:56:27.531 --> 01:56:29.451
<v Speaker 3>channel to him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Germans used the American cable </v>

1986
01:56:29.451 --> 01:56:32.691
<v Speaker 3>to send a message to Mexico offering </v>
<v Speaker 3>some American states to them if they </v>

1987
01:56:32.691 --> 01:56:34.630
<v Speaker 3>come in the war by attacking the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

1988
01:56:34.650 --> 01:56:38.460
<v Speaker 3>A little ironic there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the British have a problem.</v>

1989
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:44.750
<v Speaker 3>They can't tell the Americans about this</v>
<v Speaker 3>cable right away because then you're </v>

1990
01:56:44.750 --> 01:56:47.130
<v Speaker 3>going to get all these embarrassing </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions like how'd you get the cable?</v>

1991
01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:49.830
<v Speaker 3>And then the British would have to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>if they were going to be truthful.</v>

1992
01:56:49.831 --> 01:56:53.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we tapped into your cable and we've been</v>

1993
01:56:53.071 --> 01:56:57.750
<v Speaker 3>reading your messages for the whole war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't quite say that too easily.</v>

1994
01:56:57.930 --> 01:57:00.120
<v Speaker 3>So by hook or by Crook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a great story.</v>

1995
01:57:00.121 --> 01:57:01.830
<v Speaker 3>Barbara Tuchman wrote a whole book on </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1996
01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:07.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the British figure out a way to sort of </v>

1997
01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:07.560
<v Speaker 3>hide the source of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1998
01:57:07.561 --> 01:57:08.820
<v Speaker 3>how they got this cable.</v>

1999
01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:12.600
<v Speaker 3>They give it to the Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Woodrow Wilson is shocked.</v>

2000
01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:15.990
<v Speaker 3>Just shocked that this would happen and </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand the context,</v>

2001
01:57:15.991 --> 01:57:17.880
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the very month,</v>

2002
01:57:17.910 --> 01:57:22.910
<v Speaker 3>January 1917 that American military </v>
<v Speaker 3>forces are finally withdrawing from the </v>

2003
01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:26.340
<v Speaker 3>Poncho via expedition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2004
01:57:26.341 --> 01:57:31.341
<v Speaker 3>This attempt to go get this terrorist us</v>
<v Speaker 3>settlers in Arizona and New Mexico and </v>

2005
01:57:31.341 --> 01:57:36.141
<v Speaker 3>Texas would have called you and and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>US forest kind of comes back with their </v>

2006
01:57:36.141 --> 01:57:36.750
<v Speaker 3>tail between their legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't get Poncho via,</v>

2007
01:57:36.751 --> 01:57:39.900
<v Speaker 3>they killed a bunch of his men,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but despite,</v>

2008
01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:44.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high public praising of everything </v>

2009
01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:46.680
<v Speaker 3>involved General John Black Jack </v>
<v Speaker 3>pershing says it wasn't a very memorable</v>

2010
01:57:46.681 --> 01:57:49.020
<v Speaker 3>period in American history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nonetheless,</v>

2011
01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:51.830
<v Speaker 3>it made the Mexicans mad as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2012
01:57:51.831 --> 01:57:55.410
<v Speaker 3>and the US almost went to war with </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexico twice in two years.</v>

2013
01:57:55.680 --> 01:58:00.680
<v Speaker 3>In 1914 US troops occupied the city of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vera Cruz and about 200 people died in </v>

2014
01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:01.860
<v Speaker 3>that little endeavor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe closer to 300.</v>

2015
01:58:02.330 --> 01:58:05.670
<v Speaker 3>A nearly caused the war between the US </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Mexico.</v>

2016
01:58:05.670 --> 01:58:08.610
<v Speaker 3>Then and then in this Poncho via </v>
<v Speaker 3>expedition,</v>

2017
01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:13.620
<v Speaker 3>the u s crosses the border,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes after a guy who is also the enemy </v>

2018
01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:17.691
<v Speaker 3>of Mexico's leader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's so upset the Mexicans to have </v>

2019
01:58:17.691 --> 01:58:19.410
<v Speaker 3>US troops in their country for any </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason that that almost led to war.</v>

2020
01:58:19.650 --> 01:58:24.650
<v Speaker 3>And so just as you're getting your </v>
<v Speaker 3>troops the very month you're getting </v>

2021
01:58:24.650 --> 01:58:27.291
<v Speaker 3>your troops out of Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Germans are sending them a telegram </v>

2022
01:58:27.291 --> 01:58:27.291
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2023
01:58:27.330 --> 01:58:28.710
<v Speaker 3>want to go to war against the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States?</v>

2024
01:58:28.711 --> 01:58:30.960
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you three states,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will help you.</v>

2025
01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:37.040
<v Speaker 3>It struck a nerve for Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When Woodrow Wilson released that letter</v>

2026
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:42.260
<v Speaker 3>publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the public first heard</v>

2027
01:58:42.260 --> 01:58:47.260
<v Speaker 1>about Germany's offered in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their reaction was one that I think </v>

2028
01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:52.251
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would mirror the reaction of the </v>

2029
01:58:52.251 --> 01:58:52.251
<v Speaker 1>American public in a similar situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

2030
01:58:52.251 --> 01:58:55.130
<v Speaker 1>A large number of them thought that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>telegram was a forgery,</v>

2031
01:58:56.060 --> 01:59:01.060
<v Speaker 1>that British intelligence was behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That this was an attempt to trick the </v>

2032
01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:04.991
<v Speaker 1>American government and to affect </v>
<v Speaker 1>American public opinion and make them </v>

2033
01:59:04.991 --> 01:59:05.660
<v Speaker 1>more angry at Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More pro war.</v>

2034
01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:09.470
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting to speculate how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much you know,</v>

2035
01:59:09.471 --> 01:59:11.180
<v Speaker 1>that sort of perception would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>stayed that way.</v>

2036
01:59:11.181 --> 01:59:16.181
<v Speaker 1>If the German foreign secretary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arthur Zimmerman hadn't done something </v>

2037
01:59:16.181 --> 01:59:16.181
<v Speaker 1>in early March,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

2038
01:59:16.181 --> 01:59:20.861
<v Speaker 1>17 that looks inexplicably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he admitted that the telegram had been </v>

2039
01:59:22.221 --> 01:59:27.221
<v Speaker 1>sent and that it was genuine twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second time he,</v>

2040
01:59:27.880 --> 01:59:32.880
<v Speaker 1>he said he hoped the American people </v>
<v Speaker 1>would understand that this was only to </v>

2041
01:59:32.880 --> 01:59:35.540
<v Speaker 1>come into effect if war broke out </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Germany and the United States as</v>

2042
01:59:35.541 --> 01:59:36.380
<v Speaker 1>a way of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2043
01:59:36.381 --> 01:59:37.580
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2044
01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:42.880
<v Speaker 1>The American people wouldn't understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the confirmation that the Zimmerman </v>

2045
01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:46.931
<v Speaker 1>telegram was indeed an official secret </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposal from the German government to </v>

2046
01:59:46.931 --> 01:59:50.891
<v Speaker 1>the Mexican government have set a ton of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans and undercut the cause of </v>

2047
01:59:50.891 --> 01:59:55.091
<v Speaker 1>German Americans and Irish Americans who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were hoping to keep the United States </v>

2048
01:59:55.091 --> 01:59:58.031
<v Speaker 1>neutral was another nail in the coffin </v>
<v Speaker 1>of neutrality and a huge German misstep.</v>

2049
02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:07.720
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole decision to unleash the </v>

2050
02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:09.740
<v Speaker 1>submarines when they did was a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision by Germany.</v>

2051
02:00:10.190 --> 02:00:15.190
<v Speaker 1>If they had only waited a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Longer events would have happened that </v>

2052
02:00:15.681 --> 02:00:20.681
<v Speaker 1>would have made that move unnecessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that's the move that gets the </v>

2053
02:00:20.930 --> 02:00:25.930
<v Speaker 1>United States into the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than it would have made that event </v>

2054
02:00:25.930 --> 02:00:28.241
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Winston Churchill points out that the </v>

2055
02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:33.650
<v Speaker 1>timing of the events that happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>March and April 19,</v>

2056
02:00:33.651 --> 02:00:37.820
<v Speaker 1>17 in his mind show the hand of destiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>at work.</v>

2057
02:00:37.821 --> 02:00:41.180
<v Speaker 1>Here's how he frames what's about to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen and what's about to happen.</v>

2058
02:00:41.181 --> 02:00:46.181
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will screw up everything here and </v>

2059
02:00:46.181 --> 02:00:49.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set the stage for our modern world as </v>

2060
02:00:49.150 --> 02:00:49.670
<v Speaker 1>much as the United States getting into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this conflict will set the stage for the</v>

2061
02:00:49.671 --> 02:00:52.400
<v Speaker 1>modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia has its revolution.</v>

2062
02:00:54.670 --> 02:00:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Churchill says this quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of 1917,</v>

2063
02:00:58.660 --> 02:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>was marked by three stupendous events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German Declaration of unlimited you </v>

2064
02:01:03.761 --> 02:01:08.761
<v Speaker 1>boat wore the intervention of the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States and the Russian revolution taken </v>

2065
02:01:09.041 --> 02:01:11.560
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These events constitute the second great</v>

2066
02:01:11.561 --> 02:01:16.561
<v Speaker 1>climax of the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The order in which they were placed was </v>

2067
02:01:16.561 --> 02:01:20.161
<v Speaker 1>decisive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the Russian revolution had occurred </v>

2068
02:01:20.161 --> 02:01:22.861
<v Speaker 1>in January instead of in March,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if alternatively the Germans had </v>

2069
02:01:22.861 --> 02:01:25.180
<v Speaker 1>waited to declare unlimited you boat war</v>
<v Speaker 1>until the summer,</v>

2070
02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:30.440
<v Speaker 1>there would have been no unlimited you </v>
<v Speaker 1>boat war and consequently no </v>

2071
02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:33.871
<v Speaker 1>intervention of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the allies had been left to face the </v>

2072
02:01:33.871 --> 02:01:37.531
<v Speaker 1>collapse of Russia without being </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustained by the intervention of the </v>

2073
02:01:37.531 --> 02:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems certain that France could not </v>

2074
02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:43.990
<v Speaker 1>have survived the year and the war would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have ended in a piece by negotiation or </v>

2075
02:01:43.990 --> 02:01:48.311
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a German victory had Russia lasted two </v>

2076
02:01:48.311 --> 02:01:51.971
<v Speaker 1>months less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had Germany refrained for two months </v>

2077
02:01:51.971 --> 02:01:54.851
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole course of events would have </v>

2078
02:01:54.851 --> 02:01:54.851
<v Speaker 1>been revolutionized in this sequence.</v>

2079
02:01:54.851 --> 02:01:59.500
<v Speaker 1>We discerned the footprints of destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either Russian endurance or German </v>

2080
02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:03.440
<v Speaker 1>impatience was required to secure the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entry of the United States and both were</v>

2081
02:02:03.441 --> 02:02:08.150
<v Speaker 1>forthcoming and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we've mentioned already,</v>

2082
02:02:08.151 --> 02:02:12.530
<v Speaker 1>the situation in Russia had been seeding</v>
<v Speaker 1>and simmering for quite some time.</v>

2083
02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:17.920
<v Speaker 1>The straw that broke the camel's back </v>
<v Speaker 1>was an almost complete breakdown of </v>

2084
02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:22.571
<v Speaker 1>Russia's transportation system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which had been withering since the war </v>

2085
02:02:22.571 --> 02:02:26.561
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that had suffered terribly in the </v>

2086
02:02:26.561 --> 02:02:26.561
<v Speaker 1>winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That had just happened.</v>

2087
02:02:26.561 --> 02:02:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Russia almost couldn't handle it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>transportation needs in peace time.</v>

2088
02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:34.960
<v Speaker 1>After several years of war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were whole cities that were not </v>

2089
02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:36.860
<v Speaker 1>receiving enough food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them was the capitol Petrograd.</v>

2090
02:02:37.460 --> 02:02:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Petrograd used to be called St </v>
<v Speaker 1>Petersburg,</v>

2091
02:02:39.801 --> 02:02:43.010
<v Speaker 1>but when the war started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounded a little too German,</v>

2092
02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:46.640
<v Speaker 1>so they changed it to Petrograd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a city that will change its name</v>

2093
02:02:46.641 --> 02:02:51.641
<v Speaker 1>all the time during the communist years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be known as Leningrad now at St </v>

2094
02:02:51.641 --> 02:02:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Petersburg again.</v>

2095
02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the big metropolis and it doesn't </v>

2096
02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:00.371
<v Speaker 1>have enough food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take a bunch of people who were </v>

2097
02:03:00.371 --> 02:03:01.490
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>already add the war ad no food.</v>

2098
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not surprising they were marching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd been doing it all throughout </v>

2099
02:03:06.910 --> 02:03:10.121
<v Speaker 1>1917.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His Irish historian William Mulligan </v>

2100
02:03:10.121 --> 02:03:11.120
<v Speaker 1>points out quote from the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>1917,</v>

2101
02:03:11.121 --> 02:03:14.480
<v Speaker 1>there was a wave of strikes concentrated</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Petrograd.</v>

2102
02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:17.000
<v Speaker 1>On the seventh of March,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,000</v>

2103
02:03:17.001 --> 02:03:19.490
<v Speaker 1>workers were locked out of the feudal </v>
<v Speaker 1>law of armaments,</v>

2104
02:03:19.491 --> 02:03:21.830
<v Speaker 1>plants in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The following day,</v>

2105
02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>International Women's Day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women gathered in the viborg working </v>

2106
02:03:26.980 --> 02:03:29.060
<v Speaker 1>class district protest against high bred</v>
<v Speaker 1>prices.</v>

2107
02:03:29.300 --> 02:03:32.900
<v Speaker 1>They marched past Finland station toward</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevsky prospect,</v>

2108
02:03:32.930 --> 02:03:35.420
<v Speaker 1>by which time the strikers number to </v>
<v Speaker 1>$100,000</v>

2109
02:03:35.660 --> 02:03:40.660
<v Speaker 1>down with the war down with the high </v>
<v Speaker 1>cost of living down with hunger bread </v>

2110
02:03:40.881 --> 02:03:45.881
<v Speaker 1>for the workers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cried as they marched through the </v>

2111
02:03:45.881 --> 02:03:48.161
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The protesters connected their </v>

2112
02:03:48.161 --> 02:03:48.710
<v Speaker 1>experience of war with much broader </v>
<v Speaker 1>political claims.</v>

2113
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Although the crux of their complaints </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the food supply crisis.</v>

2114
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:57.310
<v Speaker 1>This material experience of war had </v>
<v Speaker 1>political implications including the </v>

2115
02:03:57.310 --> 02:03:57.740
<v Speaker 1>overthrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the czarist regime,</v>

2116
02:03:57.920 --> 02:03:59.120
<v Speaker 1>and an end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war.</v>

2117
02:03:59.300 --> 02:04:03.620
<v Speaker 1>It was possible in theory that the food </v>
<v Speaker 1>supply system could be reformed,</v>

2118
02:04:03.800 --> 02:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>but the strikers knew the czarist regime</v>
<v Speaker 1>could no longer reform itself and quote </v>

2119
02:04:10.130 --> 02:04:15.130
<v Speaker 1>British General Sir Henry Wilson Winter </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia during this time period and came </v>

2120
02:04:15.291 --> 02:04:19.550
<v Speaker 1>back and reported to his peers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2121
02:04:19.551 --> 02:04:23.300
<v Speaker 1>concerning how the people in Russia felt</v>
<v Speaker 1>toward the czar and Zarina and told them</v>

2122
02:04:23.301 --> 02:04:26.720
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems as certain as anything can be,</v>

2123
02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:29.540
<v Speaker 1>that the emperor and empress are riding </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a fall.</v>

2124
02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:31.190
<v Speaker 1>Everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>officers,</v>

2125
02:04:31.191 --> 02:04:32.210
<v Speaker 1>merchants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies,</v>

2126
02:04:32.211 --> 02:04:35.480
<v Speaker 1>talk openly of the absolute necessity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing away with them.</v>

2127
02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>They've lost their people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are no bulls and now their army </v>

2128
02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:43.940
<v Speaker 1>and I see no hope for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There will be terrible trouble one day </v>

2129
02:04:43.940 --> 02:04:47.211
<v Speaker 1>here and to quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are open discussions amongst some </v>

2130
02:04:48.181 --> 02:04:53.181
<v Speaker 1>at the higher levels of Russian society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That terror attack should be made </v>

2131
02:04:53.181 --> 02:04:57.531
<v Speaker 1>against the czar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone stands up at the Duma and </v>

2132
02:04:57.531 --> 02:05:00.081
<v Speaker 1>important person later in this story and</v>
<v Speaker 1>says that the czar needs to be removed </v>

2133
02:05:00.081 --> 02:05:01.920
<v Speaker 1>by terrorist means if necessary.</v>

2134
02:05:03.970 --> 02:05:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Now it would be foolish to say that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>royal court did not have their </v>

2135
02:05:08.970 --> 02:05:10.090
<v Speaker 1>supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did,</v>

2136
02:05:10.450 --> 02:05:13.000
<v Speaker 1>and they had people who didn't have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with,</v>

2137
02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:14.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when emperor,</v>

2138
02:05:14.231 --> 02:05:16.630
<v Speaker 1>but they had a problem with Nicholas the</v>
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>

2139
02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:21.720
<v Speaker 1>so there were all stripes in this idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the czar needed to go and no </v>

2140
02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:26.521
<v Speaker 1>consensus at all about what would take </v>
<v Speaker 1>its place or how to get from here to </v>

2141
02:05:26.521 --> 02:05:26.521
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2142
02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Russia and knew how to have protests and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to revolt about a dozen years before </v>

2143
02:05:32.300 --> 02:05:33.980
<v Speaker 1>this time period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had the famous 19,</v>

2144
02:05:33.981 --> 02:05:35.010
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five revolution,</v>

2145
02:05:35.550 --> 02:05:37.740
<v Speaker 1>which had also come after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2146
02:05:37.741 --> 02:05:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Russian problems in a war and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution broke out.</v>

2147
02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:47.480
<v Speaker 1>It got so serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The czar supposedly wrote out his </v>

2148
02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:47.880
<v Speaker 1>application letter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't deliver it,</v>

2149
02:05:47.881 --> 02:05:51.630
<v Speaker 1>but it was ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that particular revolution.</v>

2150
02:05:51.631 --> 02:05:55.710
<v Speaker 1>The crowd marched on the Winter Palace </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the czar was to align of troops who</v>

2151
02:05:55.711 --> 02:05:57.930
<v Speaker 1>opened fire on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killing hundreds of them.</v>

2152
02:05:57.960 --> 02:06:02.960
<v Speaker 1>It's known as bloody Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bizarre had received intelligence </v>

2153
02:06:02.960 --> 02:06:07.401
<v Speaker 1>reports a few months before this event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saying that quote recently.</v>

2154
02:06:08.761 --> 02:06:12.570
<v Speaker 1>The conviction has been expressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>without exception that we are on the eve</v>

2155
02:06:12.571 --> 02:06:15.000
<v Speaker 1>of great events in comparison with which</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

2156
02:06:15.001 --> 02:06:15.690
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five was,</v>

2157
02:06:15.691 --> 02:06:20.691
<v Speaker 1>but a toy and the quote that was from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>police report that the czar received </v>

2158
02:06:21.180 --> 02:06:24.000
<v Speaker 1>months before these demonstrations in </v>
<v Speaker 1>March break out.</v>

2159
02:06:25.250 --> 02:06:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know as with many historical events,</v>

2160
02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:33.950
<v Speaker 1>they can be seemingly inevitable for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>longest time and still come as a </v>

2161
02:06:33.950 --> 02:06:37.701
<v Speaker 1>surprise when they actually show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who were out in the streets </v>

2162
02:06:37.701 --> 02:06:38.220
<v Speaker 1>March 7th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>March eighth,</v>

2163
02:06:38.221 --> 02:06:43.221
<v Speaker 1>which was international women's Day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know that this is the </v>

2164
02:06:43.221 --> 02:06:43.221
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2165
02:06:43.221 --> 02:06:48.021
<v Speaker 1>the people on the scene point out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the tipping moments in </v>

2166
02:06:48.021 --> 02:06:48.810
<v Speaker 1>this situation when people understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

2167
02:06:48.811 --> 02:06:51.750
<v Speaker 1>this just isn't another demonstration </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the kind we've been having.</v>

2168
02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:54.690
<v Speaker 1>This is the chance to topple the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

2169
02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:59.720
<v Speaker 1>That's the big turning point and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual moment of the turning point is </v>

2170
02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:02.820
<v Speaker 1>one of those really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost turning point in history moments.</v>

2171
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Revolutionaries like Leon Trotsky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who certainly see it that way.</v>

2172
02:07:06.061 --> 02:07:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Spend a lot of time talking about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

2173
02:07:08.671 --> 02:07:11.700
<v Speaker 1>The tipping point in the revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is seven days by the way,</v>

2174
02:07:11.701 --> 02:07:15.960
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven days for a 300 year old dynasty to</v>

2175
02:07:15.961 --> 02:07:16.470
<v Speaker 1>fall,</v>

2176
02:07:18.230 --> 02:07:21.500
<v Speaker 1>and it starts off with some factory </v>
<v Speaker 1>strikers on March seventh.</v>

2177
02:07:21.650 --> 02:07:23.090
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is our calendar.</v>

2178
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:26.780
<v Speaker 1>These events in Russia happening on on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the old calendar in February,</v>

2179
02:07:26.781 --> 02:07:31.781
<v Speaker 1>so it's often called the February </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution and it makes the dating </v>

2180
02:07:31.781 --> 02:07:32.840
<v Speaker 1>confusing as heck for someone like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

2181
02:07:32.841 --> 02:07:35.890
<v Speaker 1>March seventh by our calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1917,</v>

2182
02:07:36.050 --> 02:07:41.050
<v Speaker 1>there is an industrial strike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>March eighth is international women's </v>

2183
02:07:41.050 --> 02:07:44.791
<v Speaker 1>Day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The women go out and strike and protest </v>

2184
02:07:44.791 --> 02:07:47.491
<v Speaker 1>about the lack of brand and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This seems to be key and so many people </v>

2185
02:07:47.491 --> 02:07:49.390
<v Speaker 1>talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that the women are doing this,</v>

2186
02:07:49.391 --> 02:07:52.060
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these women are the wives of </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers at the front,</v>

2187
02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:54.460
<v Speaker 1>which gives them a huge amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>credibility,</v>

2188
02:07:54.461 --> 02:07:59.410
<v Speaker 1>as you might imagine with other soldiers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're out on international women's</v>

2189
02:07:59.411 --> 02:08:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the eighth,</v>

2190
02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:03.760
<v Speaker 1>on the ninth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the women come back out,</v>

2191
02:08:03.790 --> 02:08:08.530
<v Speaker 1>bring more people and go to factories </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shops and businesses and grabbed the</v>

2192
02:08:08.531 --> 02:08:13.531
<v Speaker 1>workers out and have them join the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strike and the crowd swells to at least </v>

2193
02:08:13.531 --> 02:08:13.531
<v Speaker 1>twice.</v>

2194
02:08:13.531 --> 02:08:15.250
<v Speaker 1>What it was the day before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the next day,</v>

2195
02:08:15.670 --> 02:08:20.670
<v Speaker 1>the industry of Russia's capital is </v>
<v Speaker 1>paralyzed and to show you how out of </v>

2196
02:08:21.671 --> 02:08:26.671
<v Speaker 1>touch the Zarina is with all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she writes in her diary on March 10th </v>

2197
02:08:27.100 --> 02:08:32.100
<v Speaker 1>about the troubles in the capital and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she's basically in charge and the </v>

2198
02:08:32.100 --> 02:08:35.590
<v Speaker 1>capital quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a hooligan movement.</v>

2199
02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Young people run and shout that there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>no bread simply to create excitement </v>

2200
02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:43.120
<v Speaker 1>along with the workers who prevent </v>
<v Speaker 1>others from working.</v>

2201
02:08:43.300 --> 02:08:46.450
<v Speaker 1>If the weather was very cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would probably all stay at home,</v>

2202
02:08:46.690 --> 02:08:50.710
<v Speaker 1>but all this will pass and become calm </v>
<v Speaker 1>if only the Duma will behave itself.</v>

2203
02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:54.190
<v Speaker 1>And quote the Duma is the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>legislature,</v>

2204
02:08:54.191 --> 02:08:59.191
<v Speaker 1>which I think I said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has about one percent of the power in </v>

2205
02:08:59.191 --> 02:08:59.191
<v Speaker 1>the system and his art has about 99 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

2206
02:08:59.230 --> 02:09:04.230
<v Speaker 1>And is our arena is complaining that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumas misusing its one percent sort of </v>

2207
02:09:04.720 --> 02:09:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Russian revolutionary.</v>

2208
02:09:05.740 --> 02:09:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Leon Trotsky compares her pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>convincingly to Marie Antoinette before </v>

2209
02:09:10.740 --> 02:09:13.330
<v Speaker 1>the French Revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let them eat cake statement there.</v>

2210
02:09:13.630 --> 02:09:18.160
<v Speaker 1>And she and the czar and before he died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rasputin liked this one.</v>

2211
02:09:18.220 --> 02:09:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Russian minister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy named protocol pop off and so he </v>

2212
02:09:23.220 --> 02:09:26.851
<v Speaker 1>begins to sort of act as the Zarina's </v>
<v Speaker 1>minister in all this situation and </v>

2213
02:09:26.851 --> 02:09:29.260
<v Speaker 1>according to someone the scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's anger at him.</v>

2214
02:09:29.410 --> 02:09:34.410
<v Speaker 1>That prompts a lot of this activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The events that are happening starting </v>

2215
02:09:34.451 --> 02:09:39.451
<v Speaker 1>really on March eighth and then March </v>
<v Speaker 1>9th are large enough to be a big news </v>

2216
02:09:39.451 --> 02:09:40.840
<v Speaker 1>story and the international media is </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2217
02:09:41.110 --> 02:09:45.100
<v Speaker 1>There are magazine journalists there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a newspaper reporters from Britain,</v>

2218
02:09:45.101 --> 02:09:46.150
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>places like that,</v>

2219
02:09:46.151 --> 02:09:49.720
<v Speaker 1>telling the folks back home what's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on in the Russian capital.</v>

2220
02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:54.960
<v Speaker 1>One is a British newspaper man named </v>
<v Speaker 1>John Pollock and he writes about the </v>

2221
02:09:54.971 --> 02:09:57.910
<v Speaker 1>women protesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He calls them bread riots.</v>

2222
02:09:58.630 --> 02:10:00.910
<v Speaker 1>He writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is about March eight,</v>

2223
02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:04.110
<v Speaker 1>and my apologies for my Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronunciation quote.</v>

2224
02:10:04.630 --> 02:10:07.600
<v Speaker 1>The rioting was so far confined to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vibe Berg side,</v>

2225
02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:10.000
<v Speaker 1>the chief workman's quarter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Petrograd,</v>

2226
02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:13.750
<v Speaker 1>but in the center of the tramway service</v>
<v Speaker 1>had already become irregular.</v>

2227
02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:16.750
<v Speaker 1>On the ninth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rioters stopped the trams across the</v>

2228
02:10:16.751 --> 02:10:21.751
<v Speaker 1>river terrorizing the drivers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing parts of the mechanism away so </v>

2229
02:10:21.751 --> 02:10:24.880
<v Speaker 1>that the service groups still more </v>
<v Speaker 1>intermittent visits were paid to all the</v>

2230
02:10:24.881 --> 02:10:28.720
<v Speaker 1>factories and the hands were called out </v>
<v Speaker 1>in sympathetic strike against the sudden</v>

2231
02:10:28.721 --> 02:10:33.721
<v Speaker 1>food shortage on this day to a prefect </v>
<v Speaker 1>of police who threatened the crowd was </v>

2232
02:10:33.721 --> 02:10:34.070
<v Speaker 1>killed,</v>

2233
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:36.950
<v Speaker 3>strong coast act squadrons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>patrol Petrograd,</v>

2234
02:10:37.100 --> 02:10:42.100
<v Speaker 3>and there was a collision on the Nevsky </v>
<v Speaker 3>in which the cost actually used their </v>

2235
02:10:42.100 --> 02:10:45.371
<v Speaker 3>whips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they told the crowd that they would </v>

2236
02:10:45.371 --> 02:10:45.380
<v Speaker 3>not shoot so long as they only asked for</v>
<v Speaker 3>bread,</v>

2237
02:10:45.590 --> 02:10:50.590
<v Speaker 3>alarmed at the attitude of the Cossacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The authorities on the 10th brought </v>

2238
02:10:50.590 --> 02:10:52.100
<v Speaker 3>troops of the line into the streets to </v>
<v Speaker 3>support the police,</v>

2239
02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:55.730
<v Speaker 3>posted machine guns on the Nevsky and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped traffic across it.</v>

2240
02:10:55.731 --> 02:11:00.731
<v Speaker 3>At many points and quote John Pawlik </v>
<v Speaker 3>then points out it sounds like a rumor,</v>

2241
02:11:02.911 --> 02:11:07.911
<v Speaker 3>but what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the Russian minister working for </v>

2242
02:11:07.911 --> 02:11:10.371
<v Speaker 3>this arena is supposed to have said when</v>
<v Speaker 3>his methods for dealing with this </v>

2243
02:11:10.371 --> 02:11:12.270
<v Speaker 3>uprising or being questioned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what Paul writes.</v>

2244
02:11:12.271 --> 02:11:16.170
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quote Frodo popoff approached by one who</v>

2245
02:11:16.171 --> 02:11:19.440
<v Speaker 3>endeavored to convince him of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>madness of his methods only answered,</v>

2246
02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:22.950
<v Speaker 3>do you know how splendidly machine guns </v>
<v Speaker 3>work from the roof?</v>

2247
02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:28.760
<v Speaker 3>End Quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pollock says that the first serious </v>

2248
02:11:29.481 --> 02:11:34.481
<v Speaker 3>bloodshed happens on March 10th when </v>
<v Speaker 3>police opened fire on a group of </v>

2249
02:11:34.481 --> 02:11:38.411
<v Speaker 3>protestors and killer wound 50.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The czar is now told about problems at </v>

2250
02:11:39.651 --> 02:11:40.490
<v Speaker 3>the capital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember,</v>

2251
02:11:40.491 --> 02:11:44.840
<v Speaker 3>he's off kind of at the front,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in this capital of his.</v>

2252
02:11:44.841 --> 02:11:47.780
<v Speaker 3>He's letting his wife sort of run the </v>
<v Speaker 3>show with this product pop off guy.</v>

2253
02:11:48.190 --> 02:11:49.610
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the czar finds out about it.</v>

2254
02:11:49.611 --> 02:11:53.210
<v Speaker 3>They tell them things are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He issues an order that basically says,</v>

2255
02:11:53.211 --> 02:11:54.200
<v Speaker 3>make it stop.</v>

2256
02:11:56.160 --> 02:12:00.630
<v Speaker 3>That order appears on lamp posts and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the city.</v>

2257
02:12:00.780 --> 02:12:03.510
<v Speaker 3>The next morning when the rioters and </v>
<v Speaker 3>protesters,</v>

2258
02:12:03.860 --> 02:12:07.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>muster to protests for the day,</v>

2259
02:12:07.611 --> 02:12:11.360
<v Speaker 3>they see this message from the head of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Petro grads.</v>

2260
02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:15.390
<v Speaker 3>Military garrison quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the last days,</v>

2261
02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:20.480
<v Speaker 3>disorders have taken place in Petrograd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>followed by force and assaults on the </v>

2262
02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:22.170
<v Speaker 3>lives of soldiers and members of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>police.</v>

2263
02:12:22.410 --> 02:12:25.140
<v Speaker 3>I forbid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every kind of assembly in the streets.</v>

2264
02:12:25.290 --> 02:12:30.290
<v Speaker 3>I warned the population of Petrograd </v>
<v Speaker 3>that commands have been issued and </v>

2265
02:12:30.290 --> 02:12:34.191
<v Speaker 3>repeated to the troops to use their arms</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not to stop short of anything in </v>

2266
02:12:34.191 --> 02:12:37.200
<v Speaker 3>order to assure a tranquility in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>capital end.</v>

2267
02:12:37.201 --> 02:12:42.201
<v Speaker 3>Quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Pollock is out in the streets that </v>

2268
02:12:42.201 --> 02:12:43.030
<v Speaker 3>day when he writes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quote</v>

2269
02:12:43.730 --> 02:12:45.140
<v Speaker 3>Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>March Eleventh,</v>

2270
02:12:45.141 --> 02:12:50.141
<v Speaker 3>began nervously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were soldiers everywhere in the </v>

2271
02:12:50.141 --> 02:12:51.290
<v Speaker 3>streets and strong bodies held in </v>
<v Speaker 3>reserve and courtyards.</v>

2272
02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:56.560
<v Speaker 3>By now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the trams had all stopped and it was </v>

2273
02:12:56.560 --> 02:12:56.960
<v Speaker 3>hardly possible to find a car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No newspapers appeared.</v>

2274
02:12:57.170 --> 02:12:58.370
<v Speaker 3>About 3:30</v>
<v Speaker 3>PM,</v>

2275
02:12:58.371 --> 02:13:02.030
<v Speaker 3>the troops begin to clear the streets </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the Nevsky at the bayonet point,</v>

2276
02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:07.240
<v Speaker 3>and soon afterwards the police turned </v>
<v Speaker 3>their machine guns onto a crowd at the </v>

2277
02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:09.500
<v Speaker 3>same place as the day before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with more deadly effect.</v>

2278
02:13:09.740 --> 02:13:14.740
<v Speaker 3>A Caucasian officer who was nearby </v>
<v Speaker 3>estimating the number of dead at 300 at </v>

2279
02:13:14.781 --> 02:13:17.360
<v Speaker 3>the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>heavy firing took place further down the</v>

2280
02:13:17.361 --> 02:13:19.790
<v Speaker 3>Nevsky and opposite the Khazan </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cathedral.</v>

2281
02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Several score.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More people were killed.</v>

2282
02:13:22.190 --> 02:13:24.650
<v Speaker 3>The crowd here retaliated with pistol </v>
<v Speaker 3>shots,</v>

2283
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:28.070
<v Speaker 3>another prefix and a colonel of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>police besides policemen,</v>

2284
02:13:28.071 --> 02:13:30.620
<v Speaker 3>the various innocent passengers by being</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>

2285
02:13:31.170 --> 02:13:32.070
<v Speaker 3>It was significant.</v>

2286
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:34.410
<v Speaker 1>He writes that soldiers were seen among </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowd,</v>

2287
02:13:34.411 --> 02:13:39.411
<v Speaker 1>firing on the police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a number of men in some 14 officers </v>

2288
02:13:39.411 --> 02:13:42.981
<v Speaker 1>are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Detachments were arrested for refusing </v>

2289
02:13:42.981 --> 02:13:43.830
<v Speaker 1>to support the police with arms on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same afternoon,</v>

2290
02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:46.620
<v Speaker 1>a drunken officer of the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>regiment named nameless,</v>

2291
02:13:46.621 --> 02:13:49.170
<v Speaker 1>gavage ordered his men to fire on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowd.</v>

2292
02:13:49.380 --> 02:13:54.380
<v Speaker 1>They refuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but less gavish forced one of the </v>

2293
02:13:54.380 --> 02:13:54.780
<v Speaker 1>soldiers to obey his shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed a woman.</v>

2294
02:13:55.290 --> 02:13:55.890
<v Speaker 1>And to quote</v>

2295
02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:00.250
<v Speaker 1>the hurting of women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

2296
02:14:00.251 --> 02:14:05.251
<v Speaker 1>seems to be an important part of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>affair because it's mentioned by </v>

2297
02:14:05.251 --> 02:14:05.410
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trotsky says,</v>

2298
02:14:05.411 --> 02:14:10.411
<v Speaker 1>the rumor that was going around was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>a police officer struck a woman with a </v>

2299
02:14:10.841 --> 02:14:15.841
<v Speaker 1>club and that this was witnessed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cassettes who were sort of sitting by </v>

2300
02:14:15.841 --> 02:14:16.710
<v Speaker 1>neutrally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2301
02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:19.780
<v Speaker 1>they're there to kind of add some muscle</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the mix,</v>

2302
02:14:19.781 --> 02:14:24.781
<v Speaker 1>but the army's kind of standing by while</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hated police and the public face </v>

2303
02:14:24.781 --> 02:14:28.711
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Trotsky says whether or not it </v>

2304
02:14:28.711 --> 02:14:28.930
<v Speaker 1>really happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody believed that a woman had been</v>

2305
02:14:28.931 --> 02:14:32.800
<v Speaker 1>assaulted in front of the costs x and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Cossacks drove the police away.</v>

2306
02:14:32.801 --> 02:14:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Who did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2307
02:14:34.721 --> 02:14:37.870
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that if you've watched</v>
<v Speaker 1>recent revolutions,</v>

2308
02:14:37.871 --> 02:14:40.990
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice that oftentimes some </v>
<v Speaker 1>incident will happen,</v>

2309
02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:46.200
<v Speaker 1>that the demonstrators and protesters </v>
<v Speaker 1>and rioters will sort of cling to some </v>

2310
02:14:46.631 --> 02:14:51.631
<v Speaker 1>sort of symbol generally from the event </v>
<v Speaker 1>that becomes almost like a high sign </v>

2311
02:14:52.121 --> 02:14:56.680
<v Speaker 1>that protesters use and that they rally </v>
<v Speaker 1>around according to Trotsky.</v>

2312
02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:02.040
<v Speaker 1>What it was in this revolution was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cavalryman winking to the crowd</v>

2313
02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:08.500
<v Speaker 1>and that this wink became sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbol of what was going on.</v>

2314
02:15:08.501 --> 02:15:13.501
<v Speaker 1>Here's the way Trotsky explained it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and remember Trotsky's or revolutionary </v>

2315
02:15:13.501 --> 02:15:17.101
<v Speaker 1>for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a hugely heroic tale and that's </v>

2316
02:15:17.101 --> 02:15:17.980
<v Speaker 1>the way he tells it and I think we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>all colored.</v>

2317
02:15:18.040 --> 02:15:21.790
<v Speaker 1>At least those of us who know what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming by what's coming.</v>

2318
02:15:22.450 --> 02:15:27.450
<v Speaker 1>This revolution's going to devolve into </v>
<v Speaker 1>something very terrible and a lot of us </v>

2319
02:15:27.450 --> 02:15:31.810
<v Speaker 1>look back on this event thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how we should view the removal of</v>

2320
02:15:31.811 --> 02:15:36.811
<v Speaker 1>what came before communism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet there was a period after this </v>

2321
02:15:36.811 --> 02:15:40.801
<v Speaker 1>revolution where Russia was on the road </v>
<v Speaker 1>to becoming something more like the </v>

2322
02:15:40.900 --> 02:15:45.900
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so getting rid of a czarist regime </v>

2323
02:15:45.900 --> 02:15:49.180
<v Speaker 1>that these people seem to hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Saddam Hussein was initially viewed</v>

2324
02:15:49.570 --> 02:15:51.880
<v Speaker 1>as a plus and the reporter on the scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2325
02:15:51.881 --> 02:15:56.881
<v Speaker 1>for the British press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's thoroughly in favor of something </v>

2326
02:15:56.881 --> 02:15:59.780
<v Speaker 1>replacing this regime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States is too,</v>

2327
02:15:59.781 --> 02:16:04.781
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the problems the United States </v>

2328
02:16:04.781 --> 02:16:06.911
<v Speaker 1>has with joining the allies are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with the allies is not </v>

2329
02:16:06.911 --> 02:16:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Britain and France who they feel very </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to in a lot of ways it's Russia to</v>

2330
02:16:10.551 --> 02:16:15.551
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia is the same kind of militant </v>

2331
02:16:15.551 --> 02:16:17.600
<v Speaker 1>autocracy that US propaganda paints the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans as</v>

2332
02:16:19.210 --> 02:16:24.210
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the czar going away to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>replaced by some sort of constitutional </v>

2333
02:16:24.210 --> 02:16:25.370
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes a lot of people in the allied camp</v>

2334
02:16:25.371 --> 02:16:28.270
<v Speaker 1>sit up and cheer for the protesters.</v>

2335
02:16:30.180 --> 02:16:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Now in the story by Trotsky of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>winking Casech,</v>

2336
02:16:33.150 --> 02:16:38.150
<v Speaker 1>he explains that the officers or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cost x kind of forced them to charge </v>

2337
02:16:38.150 --> 02:16:41.691
<v Speaker 1>into the crowd at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as the officers passed by </v>

2338
02:16:41.691 --> 02:16:44.841
<v Speaker 1>and scattered the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the regular costs x are very careful </v>

2339
02:16:44.841 --> 02:16:46.110
<v Speaker 1>moving through with their horses not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt anyone.</v>

2340
02:16:46.620 --> 02:16:50.190
<v Speaker 1>And Trotsky writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote behind them,</v>

2341
02:16:50.191 --> 02:16:52.500
<v Speaker 1>filling the whole width of the prospect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gallup,</v>

2342
02:16:52.501 --> 02:16:57.501
<v Speaker 1>the cossacks decisive moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the horseman cautiously in a long </v>

2343
02:16:57.501 --> 02:17:00.480
<v Speaker 1>ribbon rode through the court or just </v>
<v Speaker 1>made by the officers.</v>

2344
02:17:00.630 --> 02:17:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Some of them smiled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he quotes a protester,</v>

2345
02:17:03.850 --> 02:17:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Kaya Rev recalls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of them gave the workers a good </v>

2346
02:17:08.850 --> 02:17:08.850
<v Speaker 1>wink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This wink,</v>

2347
02:17:08.850 --> 02:17:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Trotsky says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not without meaning.</v>

2348
02:17:11.250 --> 02:17:13.260
<v Speaker 1>The workers were in bold and with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly,</v>

2349
02:17:13.350 --> 02:17:17.390
<v Speaker 1>not hostile kind of assurance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly infected the contacts with it.</v>

2350
02:17:17.670 --> 02:17:22.670
<v Speaker 1>The one who winked found imitators in </v>
<v Speaker 1>spite of renewed efforts from the </v>

2351
02:17:22.670 --> 02:17:22.670
<v Speaker 1>officers.</v>

2352
02:17:22.670 --> 02:17:25.440
<v Speaker 1>The Cossacks without openly breaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline,</v>

2353
02:17:25.650 --> 02:17:30.090
<v Speaker 1>fail to force the crowd to disperse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but flowed through it in streams.</v>

2354
02:17:30.210 --> 02:17:35.210
<v Speaker 1>This was repeated three or four times </v>
<v Speaker 1>and brought the two sides even closer </v>

2355
02:17:35.210 --> 02:17:35.690
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Individual costs.</v>

2356
02:17:35.700 --> 02:17:40.700
<v Speaker 1>X began to reply to the workers </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions and even to enter into </v>

2357
02:17:40.700 --> 02:17:42.270
<v Speaker 1>momentary conversations with them of </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline.</v>

2358
02:17:42.271 --> 02:17:47.271
<v Speaker 1>There remained but a thin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transparent shell that threatened to </v>

2359
02:17:47.271 --> 02:17:50.541
<v Speaker 1>break through any second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The officers hastened to separate their </v>

2360
02:17:50.541 --> 02:17:53.100
<v Speaker 1>patrol from the workers and abandoned </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of dispersing them lying to the</v>

2361
02:17:53.101 --> 02:17:58.101
<v Speaker 1>coast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>x out across the street as a barrier to </v>

2362
02:17:58.101 --> 02:17:58.890
<v Speaker 1>prevent the demonstrators from getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the center and to quote.</v>

2363
02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:04.160
<v Speaker 1>He then tells the story though about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>these costs x will allow themselves to </v>

2364
02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:07.071
<v Speaker 1>be used as a mounted barrier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't stop the protestors from </v>

2365
02:18:07.071 --> 02:18:10.841
<v Speaker 1>diving under the horses' bellies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that the Cossacks traditionally</v>

2366
02:18:12.061 --> 02:18:17.061
<v Speaker 1>these czarist crowd control mechanism </v>
<v Speaker 1>appear less than enthusiastic about </v>

2367
02:18:18.031 --> 02:18:23.031
<v Speaker 1>carrying out their traditional role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>convinces the government that they have </v>

2368
02:18:23.031 --> 02:18:25.300
<v Speaker 1>to bring in the troops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The garrison of Petrograd is like 150,</v>

2369
02:18:25.301 --> 02:18:27.000
<v Speaker 1>a hundred 60,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

2370
02:18:27.270 --> 02:18:32.270
<v Speaker 1>so they've got the people and they call </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in and March 11th is the key day </v>

2371
02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:34.230
<v Speaker 1>because that's the day that elements of </v>
<v Speaker 1>one famous unit,</v>

2372
02:18:34.231 --> 02:18:39.231
<v Speaker 1>a training squadron that's called open </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire and killed those people that the </v>

2373
02:18:39.231 --> 02:18:39.780
<v Speaker 1>British reporter was talking about.</v>

2374
02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Now the people of Petrograd are </v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing to the troops as you heard </v>

2375
02:18:46.380 --> 02:18:47.170
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mingling with them,</v>

2376
02:18:47.171 --> 02:18:52.171
<v Speaker 1>talking to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are walking up to the line of </v>

2377
02:18:52.171 --> 02:18:52.171
<v Speaker 1>bayoneted troops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2378
02:18:52.171 --> 02:18:53.710
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in ones and twos and sang brothers.</v>

2379
02:18:53.711 --> 02:18:56.380
<v Speaker 1>You're not really going to side with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>police and kill us.</v>

2380
02:18:56.381 --> 02:18:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Are you the women?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2381
02:18:58.661 --> 02:19:03.661
<v Speaker 1>taking the lead in this whole thing are </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking right up to the line of </v>

2382
02:19:03.661 --> 02:19:07.410
<v Speaker 1>abandoned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had troops and grabbing their rifles </v>

2383
02:19:07.410 --> 02:19:07.410
<v Speaker 1>with the band that's on them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling with them insane.</v>

2384
02:19:07.410 --> 02:19:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Join us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very heroic.</v>

2385
02:19:10.411 --> 02:19:15.411
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of that going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the shootings in the street on </v>

2386
02:19:16.731 --> 02:19:18.320
<v Speaker 1>March 11th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2387
02:19:18.410 --> 02:19:23.410
<v Speaker 1>citizens were told workers go up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>members of one of these story units</v>

2388
02:19:25.160 --> 02:19:26.830
<v Speaker 1>and tell them that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2389
02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:30.560
<v Speaker 1>people in your unit opened fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday against the people of the city</v>

2390
02:19:30.620 --> 02:19:33.590
<v Speaker 1>and told them what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then those troops went back to their</v>

2391
02:19:33.591 --> 02:19:34.940
<v Speaker 1>barracks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on the evening of March,</v>

2392
02:19:34.941 --> 02:19:39.941
<v Speaker 1>11th morning of March twelfth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had one of those moral crisis </v>

2393
02:19:39.941 --> 02:19:43.460
<v Speaker 1>moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a key instant in any revolution.</v>

2394
02:19:43.461 --> 02:19:48.461
<v Speaker 1>A guy like Leon Trotsky would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he describes it with almost heroic,</v>

2395
02:19:49.930 --> 02:19:50.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tones.</v>

2396
02:19:51.260 --> 02:19:56.260
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this moment where this story unit </v>

2397
02:19:56.260 --> 02:19:58.730
<v Speaker 1>confronts the reality that they shot a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of those poor people that had been</v>

2398
02:19:58.731 --> 02:20:02.750
<v Speaker 1>besieging them not to shoot the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>before and they were going to have to go</v>

2399
02:20:02.751 --> 02:20:06.050
<v Speaker 1>out and do it again today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what Trotsky writes,</v>

2400
02:20:06.051 --> 02:20:11.051
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soldiers had no more time for </v>

2401
02:20:11.051 --> 02:20:14.081
<v Speaker 1>hesitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were compelled to shoot yesterday </v>

2402
02:20:14.081 --> 02:20:17.350
<v Speaker 1>and they would be again today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The workers will not surrender or </v>

2403
02:20:17.350 --> 02:20:17.360
<v Speaker 1>retreat under fire.</v>

2404
02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:19.580
<v Speaker 1>They're still holding their own and with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

2405
02:20:19.581 --> 02:20:20.930
<v Speaker 1>their wives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mothers,</v>

2406
02:20:20.931 --> 02:20:22.190
<v Speaker 1>sisters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweethearts.</v>

2407
02:20:22.610 --> 02:20:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the very hour that they had </v>

2408
02:20:27.610 --> 02:20:27.920
<v Speaker 1>so whispered about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If only we could all get together.</v>

2409
02:20:28.700 --> 02:20:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Let me stop here at the Trotsky saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>that all these people in the city had </v>

2410
02:20:33.700 --> 02:20:34.850
<v Speaker 1>had thought about could desire be </v>
<v Speaker 1>overthrown.</v>

2411
02:20:34.851 --> 02:20:38.390
<v Speaker 1>If only we could all get together that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would happen and now these soldiers were</v>

2412
02:20:38.391 --> 02:20:41.480
<v Speaker 1>not taking part in that they were taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>part in crushing that.</v>

2413
02:20:42.290 --> 02:20:47.290
<v Speaker 1>If only we could all get together </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trotsky rights and then at that moment </v>

2414
02:20:47.290 --> 02:20:50.060
<v Speaker 1>of supreme agony in the unbearable fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the coming day,</v>

2415
02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:55.240
<v Speaker 1>the choking hatred of those who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>imposing upon them the executioners </v>

2416
02:20:55.240 --> 02:20:56.780
<v Speaker 1>role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ring out in the barrack room,</v>

2417
02:20:56.781 --> 02:21:01.070
<v Speaker 1>the first voices of open indignation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in those voices to be forever,</v>

2418
02:21:01.071 --> 02:21:06.071
<v Speaker 1>nameless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole army with relief and rapture </v>

2419
02:21:06.071 --> 02:21:07.370
<v Speaker 1>recognizes itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thus dawned upon the earth,</v>

2420
02:21:07.610 --> 02:21:11.630
<v Speaker 1>the day of destruction of the Romanov </v>
<v Speaker 1>monarchy and quote,</v>

2421
02:21:13.070 --> 02:21:14.210
<v Speaker 1>those soldiers shot there.</v>

2422
02:21:14.210 --> 02:21:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Officer ran out into the streets </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheering and joined the people of </v>

2423
02:21:19.210 --> 02:21:24.161
<v Speaker 1>Petrograd trying to overthrow the czar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They encouraged other military units to </v>

2424
02:21:25.431 --> 02:21:30.431
<v Speaker 1>follow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of which by the end of March </v>

2425
02:21:30.431 --> 02:21:33.431
<v Speaker 1>twelfth had done so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the garrison was melting away and </v>

2426
02:21:33.431 --> 02:21:37.091
<v Speaker 1>joining the anti czarist rioters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ransack the artillery depot.</v>

2427
02:21:39.261 --> 02:21:44.261
<v Speaker 1>Then they go to the arsenal and break </v>
<v Speaker 1>into it and take all the weapons than </v>

2428
02:21:44.261 --> 02:21:47.501
<v Speaker 1>they burned down the court of Justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a bunch of other government </v>

2429
02:21:47.501 --> 02:21:47.501
<v Speaker 1>buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for March twelfth on,</v>

2430
02:21:47.501 --> 02:21:52.361
<v Speaker 1>you have open battles in the streets </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the people in the army and the </v>

2431
02:21:52.361 --> 02:21:54.740
<v Speaker 1>very large police forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2432
02:21:54.741 --> 02:21:59.741
<v Speaker 1>we would call them today the secret </v>
<v Speaker 1>police and all these police agencies </v>

2433
02:21:59.741 --> 02:22:01.460
<v Speaker 1>that have set up machine guns at </v>
<v Speaker 1>intersections.</v>

2434
02:22:03.200 --> 02:22:05.870
<v Speaker 1>At this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big question is,</v>

2435
02:22:05.871 --> 02:22:10.871
<v Speaker 1>what the heck is the czar doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing is our tries to do is </v>

2436
02:22:11.151 --> 02:22:14.990
<v Speaker 1>just get rid of the Duma and when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head of this powerless,</v>

2437
02:22:14.991 --> 02:22:19.991
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian legislature receives the order </v>

2438
02:22:19.991 --> 02:22:21.140
<v Speaker 1>that the Duma is to disband.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says no,</v>

2439
02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:25.890
<v Speaker 1>and most of the Duma joins him in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street joining the revolution.</v>

2440
02:22:27.530 --> 02:22:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the czar gets on a train on the 13th of </v>

2441
02:22:32.530 --> 02:22:35.741
<v Speaker 1>March and heads back toward the capital </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the fighting front where he is in </v>

2442
02:22:35.741 --> 02:22:40.091
<v Speaker 1>one of his typically strange moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He takes a lot longer to get there than </v>

2443
02:22:40.091 --> 02:22:44.231
<v Speaker 1>he should have because he says he </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to disrupt any of the war </v>

2444
02:22:44.231 --> 02:22:44.231
<v Speaker 1>traffic heading to the front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So his.</v>

2445
02:22:44.240 --> 02:22:48.680
<v Speaker 1>His train takes sort of the long way </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and it ends up getting stopped on</v>

2446
02:22:48.681 --> 02:22:53.681
<v Speaker 1>the way to Petrograd because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution is spreading to other cities </v>

2447
02:22:53.681 --> 02:22:57.101
<v Speaker 1>now and at one of these train stops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the revolutionaries are stopping the </v>

2448
02:22:57.101 --> 02:23:00.641
<v Speaker 1>train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're told that the czars advisors are </v>

2449
02:23:00.831 --> 02:23:02.960
<v Speaker 1>bringing him telegrams from power </v>
<v Speaker 1>brokers,</v>

2450
02:23:02.961 --> 02:23:04.520
<v Speaker 1>including,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2451
02:23:04.521 --> 02:23:06.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his cousin and others that he,</v>

2452
02:23:06.700 --> 02:23:08.420
<v Speaker 1>he needs to give up the crown.</v>

2453
02:23:09.310 --> 02:23:13.990
<v Speaker 1>And what's sort of interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas is that he almost seems willing</v>

2454
02:23:13.991 --> 02:23:16.120
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole line of thinking,</v>

2455
02:23:16.300 --> 02:23:21.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you read a lot of the primary </v>

2456
02:23:21.300 --> 02:23:22.621
<v Speaker 1>sources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sometimes portrayed as this drunken </v>

2457
02:23:22.621 --> 02:23:22.621
<v Speaker 1>tyrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2458
02:23:22.621 --> 02:23:26.330
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you read more modern day </v>

2459
02:23:26.330 --> 02:23:26.330
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a much more pitiable figure.</v>

2460
02:23:26.330 --> 02:23:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Churchill likes him and moved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Churchill would like Azhar but says </v>

2461
02:23:30.930 --> 02:23:31.420
<v Speaker 1>great things about in this poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>misunderstood person.</v>

2462
02:23:31.540 --> 02:23:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Of course he wasn't a great man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a good man.</v>

2463
02:23:33.821 --> 02:23:38.821
<v Speaker 1>And he talks about it in like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the czar sort of seems to be </v>

2464
02:23:38.821 --> 02:23:41.150
<v Speaker 1>relieved by the prospect of giving up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crown.</v>

2465
02:23:41.390 --> 02:23:46.390
<v Speaker 1>At first there's like five minutes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about giving it to his hemophiliac </v>

2466
02:23:46.390 --> 02:23:47.180
<v Speaker 1>son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this art doesn't want that.</v>

2467
02:23:47.270 --> 02:23:51.680
<v Speaker 1>And interestingly enough in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>abdication note to his people,</v>

2468
02:23:51.860 --> 02:23:55.820
<v Speaker 1>the czar specifically mentions not </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to be parted from,</v>

2469
02:23:56.350 --> 02:23:57.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the son that he adores.</v>

2470
02:23:58.120 --> 02:24:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get that feeling of nicholas and </v>

2471
02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Alexandra has these kinds of parents who</v>
<v Speaker 1>just adore their children.</v>

2472
02:24:03.340 --> 02:24:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not this is some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>smokescreen to cover something,</v>

2473
02:24:06.340 --> 02:24:11.340
<v Speaker 1>all the evidence seems to point out to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who cared more about his family in </v>

2474
02:24:11.340 --> 02:24:12.400
<v Speaker 1>some ways than beings are.</v>

2475
02:24:14.130 --> 02:24:19.130
<v Speaker 1>There was a quote to the guy who will </v>
<v Speaker 1>take over the what's called the </v>

2476
02:24:19.130 --> 02:24:21.690
<v Speaker 1>provisional government of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2477
02:24:22.450 --> 02:24:25.750
<v Speaker 1>the country in the near future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name is Alexander Kerensky,</v>

2478
02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:29.920
<v Speaker 1>and he met the tsar after desire had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been taken into custody.</v>

2479
02:24:30.310 --> 02:24:31.240
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

2480
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:36.750
<v Speaker 1>as I studied his face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I seem to see behind his smile and </v>

2481
02:24:36.750 --> 02:24:37.240
<v Speaker 1>charming eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stiff,</v>

2482
02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:40.540
<v Speaker 1>proper mask of utter loneliness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>desolation.</v>

2483
02:24:40.990 --> 02:24:45.990
<v Speaker 1>When I began to know this living mask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understood why it had been so easy to </v>

2484
02:24:45.990 --> 02:24:48.130
<v Speaker 1>overthrow his power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did not wish to fight for it,</v>

2485
02:24:48.340 --> 02:24:53.340
<v Speaker 1>and it simply fell from his hands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote the things that this is our was </v>

2486
02:24:55.401 --> 02:25:00.401
<v Speaker 1>going to have to do to keep power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seemed unwilling to do.</v>

2487
02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:05.520
<v Speaker 1>His wife may have wanted him to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wrote letters telling him he needed </v>

2488
02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:09.121
<v Speaker 1>to be tougher and stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seemed to care more about the fact </v>

2489
02:25:09.121 --> 02:25:10.140
<v Speaker 1>that all his children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while all this is going on,</v>

2490
02:25:10.420 --> 02:25:15.420
<v Speaker 1>have a bad case of the measles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was pretty serious back then and </v>

2491
02:25:15.420 --> 02:25:17.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is as concerned seemingly for them as he</v>

2492
02:25:17.111 --> 02:25:18.570
<v Speaker 1>is of giving up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2493
02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:23.720
<v Speaker 1>his power all over Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they to break into government</v>

2494
02:25:24.490 --> 02:25:28.570
<v Speaker 3>buildings and tear down paintings of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>czar</v>

2495
02:25:30.650 --> 02:25:34.880
<v Speaker 3>and the aftermath of this revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like the aftermath of the fall of</v>

2496
02:25:34.881 --> 02:25:36.260
<v Speaker 3>Saddam Hussein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2497
02:25:36.261 --> 02:25:41.261
<v Speaker 3>when all these figures that were part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government that worked for the czar </v>

2498
02:25:41.261 --> 02:25:43.340
<v Speaker 3>are being arrested and held in custody </v>
<v Speaker 3>by people,</v>

2499
02:25:43.380 --> 02:25:48.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>armed with weapons to power blocks form </v>

2500
02:25:48.380 --> 02:25:49.190
<v Speaker 3>in the wake of all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because remember,</v>

2501
02:25:49.191 --> 02:25:54.191
<v Speaker 3>there is no plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real revolutionaries who had been </v>

2502
02:25:54.191 --> 02:25:56.951
<v Speaker 3>working for this for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're kind of caught off guard when it </v>

2503
02:25:56.951 --> 02:25:56.951
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

2504
02:25:56.951 --> 02:26:00.610
<v Speaker 3>there's competing groups for power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One group is the people that used to be </v>

2505
02:26:00.610 --> 02:26:04.151
<v Speaker 3>the almost powerless Duma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden they have power and </v>

2506
02:26:04.151 --> 02:26:07.160
<v Speaker 3>they're mostly liberals and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and mild socialist.</v>

2507
02:26:07.161 --> 02:26:10.610
<v Speaker 3>And people who want to create,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they end up writing the United States by</v>

2508
02:26:10.611 --> 02:26:15.611
<v Speaker 3>the way in June saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to create a constitutional </v>

2509
02:26:15.611 --> 02:26:15.611
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to use maybe the United States</v>

2510
02:26:15.611 --> 02:26:20.021
<v Speaker 3>as a sort of a model,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but competing with that particular </v>

2511
02:26:20.021 --> 02:26:24.401
<v Speaker 3>entity for power is power at a much </v>
<v Speaker 3>lower level groups that especially of </v>

2512
02:26:24.401 --> 02:26:28.691
<v Speaker 3>revolutionaries forming councils of </v>
<v Speaker 3>workers and soldiers together and they </v>

2513
02:26:30.771 --> 02:26:35.771
<v Speaker 3>formed this rough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird partnership with the provisional </v>

2514
02:26:35.771 --> 02:26:40.271
<v Speaker 3>government is it's called the former </v>
<v Speaker 3>Duma and they kind of work with each </v>

2515
02:26:40.271 --> 02:26:40.430
<v Speaker 3>other sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they come to,</v>

2516
02:26:41.170 --> 02:26:42.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disagreements over other things.</v>

2517
02:26:43.310 --> 02:26:48.020
<v Speaker 3>But when push comes to shove,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Soviets as they're called these,</v>

2518
02:26:48.660 --> 02:26:53.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elected groups of people from soldiers </v>

2519
02:26:53.660 --> 02:26:56.691
<v Speaker 3>and workers councils seems to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first thing that they win is a rule </v>

2520
02:26:57.691 --> 02:27:02.691
<v Speaker 3>that says that anything involving the </v>
<v Speaker 3>military is under the control of the </v>

2521
02:27:02.691 --> 02:27:07.351
<v Speaker 3>Soviets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is the key issue for the other </v>

2522
02:27:07.850 --> 02:27:12.020
<v Speaker 3>countries in the war in Germany wants </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia out of the war.</v>

2523
02:27:12.670 --> 02:27:17.540
<v Speaker 3>They have been paying agitators for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time to hopefully make that happen.</v>

2524
02:27:17.870 --> 02:27:20.270
<v Speaker 3>Now you have this situation where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>czars gone.</v>

2525
02:27:20.271 --> 02:27:22.130
<v Speaker 3>What are the Russians going to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>militarily,</v>

2526
02:27:22.340 --> 02:27:26.000
<v Speaker 3>the British and the French field,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same way along with the Americans.</v>

2527
02:27:26.001 --> 02:27:28.100
<v Speaker 3>They're not that upset that the czar is </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone,</v>

2528
02:27:28.310 --> 02:27:31.130
<v Speaker 3>but they're very concerned that Russia </v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to pull out of the war.</v>

2529
02:27:32.860 --> 02:27:37.860
<v Speaker 3>This provisional government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there'll be known as the Koretsky </v>

2530
02:27:37.860 --> 02:27:37.860
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At a certain point,</v>

2531
02:27:38.140 --> 02:27:40.240
<v Speaker 3>they tell the allies that they're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to continue fighting.</v>

2532
02:27:40.241 --> 02:27:44.650
<v Speaker 3>They're committed to continue fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>the allies start pouring money and stuff</v>

2533
02:27:44.651 --> 02:27:47.380
<v Speaker 3>into Russia even at a greater pace than </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were before,</v>

2534
02:27:48.070 --> 02:27:53.070
<v Speaker 3>but how do you continue to hold off </v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany in the central powers with your </v>

2535
02:27:53.070 --> 02:27:57.571
<v Speaker 3>army while you're 300 year old monarchy </v>
<v Speaker 3>is busy collapsing and all the </v>

2536
02:27:59.411 --> 02:28:04.360
<v Speaker 3>structures that have been hanging by a </v>
<v Speaker 3>string start falling apart.</v>

2537
02:28:06.030 --> 02:28:07.860
<v Speaker 3>What are the soldiers at the front going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do?</v>

2538
02:28:07.861 --> 02:28:11.430
<v Speaker 3>This became the key question and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not answered right away.</v>

2539
02:28:12.770 --> 02:28:17.770
<v Speaker 3>Churchill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as only he can solve the whole thing is </v>

2540
02:28:17.770 --> 02:28:20.981
<v Speaker 3>an unmitigated disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looking back on it from the late 19 </v>

2541
02:28:20.981 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 3>twenties again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now he can where all this is</v>

2542
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:26.030
<v Speaker 1>going to go to communism in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so his ideas are probably tainted.</v>

2543
02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:28.550
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tragedy of Russia was,</v>

2544
02:28:28.551 --> 02:28:33.551
<v Speaker 1>and I'm quoting here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that her ship went down within sight of </v>

2545
02:28:33.551 --> 02:28:33.551
<v Speaker 1>port,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning you know,</v>

2546
02:28:33.551 --> 02:28:38.161
<v Speaker 1>we were just going to win this war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then Russia doesn't get to share in </v>

2547
02:28:38.161 --> 02:28:38.161
<v Speaker 1>the spoils,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he says,</v>

2548
02:28:38.161 --> 02:28:40.820
<v Speaker 1>I've Russia quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with victory in her grasp,</v>

2549
02:28:40.970 --> 02:28:45.970
<v Speaker 1>she fell upon the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>devoured alive like Herod of old by </v>

2550
02:28:45.970 --> 02:28:48.560
<v Speaker 1>worms but not in vain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her valiant deeds,</v>

2551
02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:53.240
<v Speaker 1>the giant mortally stricken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had just time with her dying strength to</v>

2552
02:28:53.241 --> 02:28:58.241
<v Speaker 1>pass the torch eastward across the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a new titan long sunken doubt,</v>

2553
02:28:58.580 --> 02:29:01.580
<v Speaker 1>who now arose and began ponderously to </v>
<v Speaker 1>arm.</v>

2554
02:29:01.850 --> 02:29:05.330
<v Speaker 1>The Russian Empire fell on March 16th on</v>
<v Speaker 1>April sixth,</v>

2555
02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:08.620
<v Speaker 1>the United States entered the war and </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

2556
02:29:10.460 --> 02:29:15.460
<v Speaker 1>it's been an interesting two months for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States since Germany decided </v>

2557
02:29:15.460 --> 02:29:19.481
<v Speaker 1>to unleash the submarines in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>20 days of unleashing the submarines.</v>

2558
02:29:19.730 --> 02:29:23.360
<v Speaker 1>The Germans sink a hundred and 28 </v>
<v Speaker 1>merchant ships,</v>

2559
02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:26.520
<v Speaker 1>40 neutrals among them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2560
02:29:26.540 --> 02:29:31.540
<v Speaker 1>there are US shipping companies in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>month of February when this all starts </v>

2561
02:29:31.540 --> 02:29:34.280
<v Speaker 1>that start losing a million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 17 value money by the way,</v>

2562
02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:37.400
<v Speaker 1>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next month,</v>

2563
02:29:37.401 --> 02:29:38.530
<v Speaker 1>March 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>

2564
02:29:38.540 --> 02:29:43.540
<v Speaker 1>those numbers will double and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden we begin to see what the first </v>

2565
02:29:44.090 --> 02:29:49.090
<v Speaker 1>real competent use involving at least a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum number of submarines is like in </v>

2566
02:29:51.291 --> 02:29:54.350
<v Speaker 1>world history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Germans had been perfecting what you</v>

2567
02:29:54.351 --> 02:29:57.410
<v Speaker 1>do with these new weapons systems like </v>
<v Speaker 1>submarines,</v>

2568
02:29:57.411 --> 02:29:59.220
<v Speaker 1>these science fiction type weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you.</v>

2569
02:29:59.230 --> 02:30:00.800
<v Speaker 1>How do you use them at the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the war?</v>

2570
02:30:00.801 --> 02:30:03.140
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of going after war ships </v>
<v Speaker 1>and whatnot,</v>

2571
02:30:03.141 --> 02:30:08.141
<v Speaker 1>and then they work on short little burst</v>
<v Speaker 1>going after neutrals and merchant ships </v>

2572
02:30:08.141 --> 02:30:12.461
<v Speaker 1>and now by 1917 the Germans know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to do with these things and </v>

2573
02:30:12.461 --> 02:30:14.150
<v Speaker 1>they have enough ships to make their </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan work.</v>

2574
02:30:14.180 --> 02:30:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Minimum number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but enough they unleashed them to go </v>

2575
02:30:19.180 --> 02:30:21.851
<v Speaker 1>after everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what their strategy has told </v>

2576
02:30:21.851 --> 02:30:24.191
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do to really maximize this </v>

2577
02:30:24.191 --> 02:30:26.021
<v Speaker 1>weapon system and they're sinking enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>ships so that Britain is for the first </v>

2578
02:30:28.431 --> 02:30:32.120
<v Speaker 1>time in the war in real danger itself of</v>
<v Speaker 1>going under.</v>

2579
02:30:32.690 --> 02:30:36.950
<v Speaker 1>One of the advantages of being an island</v>
<v Speaker 1>nation is if you got the strongest navy,</v>

2580
02:30:37.100 --> 02:30:42.100
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to have the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fears that are Russia has or a France </v>

2581
02:30:42.100 --> 02:30:46.301
<v Speaker 1>has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Germans aren't going to be able to </v>

2582
02:30:46.301 --> 02:30:46.301
<v Speaker 1>break you directly because they can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>reach you.</v>

2583
02:30:46.301 --> 02:30:48.530
<v Speaker 1>This is the first time in the war that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the British face,</v>

2584
02:30:48.531 --> 02:30:51.980
<v Speaker 1>any serious threat of the Germans in one</v>
<v Speaker 1>way or another,</v>

2585
02:30:51.981 --> 02:30:54.290
<v Speaker 1>reaching them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>affecting them personally,</v>

2586
02:30:54.500 --> 02:30:59.420
<v Speaker 1>forcing them perhaps to knuckle under to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of peace deal.</v>

2587
02:31:00.470 --> 02:31:04.250
<v Speaker 1>In April the month the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets into the war,</v>

2588
02:31:04.910 --> 02:31:09.910
<v Speaker 1>the Germans sync for 123 merchant men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost 850,000</v>

2589
02:31:11.061 --> 02:31:12.020
<v Speaker 1>tons of shipping.</v>

2590
02:31:13.430 --> 02:31:17.450
<v Speaker 1>The British empire cannot stand those </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of losses.</v>

2591
02:31:18.740 --> 02:31:22.500
<v Speaker 1>It's submarine war that eventually </v>
<v Speaker 1>brings the United States in.</v>

2592
02:31:22.800 --> 02:31:27.800
<v Speaker 1>If for no other reason than it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupting operations in the country.</v>

2593
02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:32.100
<v Speaker 1>The president is under a lot of pressure</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a day to day increasing basis because</v>

2594
02:31:32.101 --> 02:31:33.930
<v Speaker 1>once Germany started sinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these ships,</v>

2595
02:31:34.110 --> 02:31:39.110
<v Speaker 1>US ships stopped leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They begin to congregate and clogged up </v>

2596
02:31:39.151 --> 02:31:42.960
<v Speaker 1>and cause traffic jams outside the major</v>
<v Speaker 1>ports on the eastern seaboard.</v>

2597
02:31:43.230 --> 02:31:48.230
<v Speaker 1>And then all of the commodities and food</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perishables that were going to be </v>

2598
02:31:48.230 --> 02:31:49.080
<v Speaker 1>loaded onto those ships begin backing </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2599
02:31:49.500 --> 02:31:54.500
<v Speaker 1>You got this terrible catalog at all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ports on the eastern coast of material </v>

2600
02:31:54.661 --> 02:31:59.661
<v Speaker 1>that's rotting and degrading because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ship's won't cross the Atlantic because </v>

2601
02:31:59.661 --> 02:32:02.520
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid of the submarines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At one point,</v>

2602
02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Wilson wants to arm these ships to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change the situation.</v>

2603
02:32:06.780 --> 02:32:08.520
<v Speaker 1>He wants to provide insurance so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>

2604
02:32:08.760 --> 02:32:09.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cross.</v>

2605
02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:12.270
<v Speaker 1>But this is like a ticking time bomb for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilson.</v>

2606
02:32:12.271 --> 02:32:15.690
<v Speaker 1>He's got to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This situation only going to get worse.</v>

2607
02:32:17.010 --> 02:32:19.380
<v Speaker 1>The Zimmerman telegram happens in late </v>
<v Speaker 1>February to.</v>

2608
02:32:19.500 --> 02:32:24.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean all these things that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>increases situation that's bad and make </v>

2609
02:32:24.500 --> 02:32:28.761
<v Speaker 1>it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's no instant moment where the </v>

2610
02:32:28.761 --> 02:32:30.480
<v Speaker 1>line has been crossed and there never </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be</v>

2611
02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:36.990
<v Speaker 1>at some point by March 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17 at the latest.</v>

2612
02:32:36.991 --> 02:32:39.780
<v Speaker 1>And probably around the same time the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian revolution is happening,</v>

2613
02:32:40.050 --> 02:32:45.050
<v Speaker 1>the Wilson Administration decides that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've had enough five US ships go down</v>

2614
02:32:45.991 --> 02:32:49.290
<v Speaker 1>in March 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17 to some in the Wilson Administration.</v>

2615
02:32:49.291 --> 02:32:52.980
<v Speaker 1>This is confirmation that the US has </v>
<v Speaker 1>already at war with Germany.</v>

2616
02:32:53.280 --> 02:32:58.280
<v Speaker 1>There doesn't have to be some big </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lusitania nine slash 11 moment to </v>

2617
02:32:58.280 --> 02:33:02.570
<v Speaker 1>crossover this invisible line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening every day and on April </v>

2618
02:33:02.570 --> 02:33:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Second Wilson gives his most famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>

2619
02:33:04.081 --> 02:33:09.081
<v Speaker 1>one of the most important speeches in </v>
<v Speaker 1>American history concerning the </v>

2620
02:33:09.081 --> 02:33:13.341
<v Speaker 1>situation that he sees that the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States is at war with Germany.</v>

2621
02:33:14.070 --> 02:33:15.780
<v Speaker 1>And the interesting part about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>

2622
02:33:15.781 --> 02:33:18.600
<v Speaker 1>if you dissected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's monumental on so many levels.</v>

2623
02:33:19.230 --> 02:33:21.060
<v Speaker 1>He's so crafty the way it's put </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

2624
02:33:21.090 --> 02:33:23.940
<v Speaker 1>He never says to the Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>declare war on Germany,</v>

2625
02:33:24.180 --> 02:33:25.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that will be at war with Germany.</v>

2626
02:33:25.771 --> 02:33:30.771
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're at war with Germany and I invite </v>

2627
02:33:30.771 --> 02:33:31.380
<v Speaker 1>you to confirm that fact he had no time.</v>

2628
02:33:31.380 --> 02:33:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Gives Congress the impression that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any control over this decision at </v>

2629
02:33:36.380 --> 02:33:36.380
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2630
02:33:36.380 --> 02:33:38.610
<v Speaker 1>luckily for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went along with him big time,</v>

2631
02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:43.880
<v Speaker 1>but what if they hadn't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of Wilson's speech focuses on the </v>

2632
02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:45.060
<v Speaker 1>specific reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're at this point.</v>

2633
02:33:45.061 --> 02:33:50.061
<v Speaker 1>He talks about the submarine warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compares Germans to pirates and all </v>

2634
02:33:50.061 --> 02:33:53.781
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he takes some time out of his </v>

2635
02:33:53.781 --> 02:33:54.780
<v Speaker 1>speech to say that we're not at war with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German people.</v>

2636
02:33:54.781 --> 02:33:59.781
<v Speaker 1>We have no quarrel with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's their government we don't like and </v>

2637
02:33:59.781 --> 02:34:03.291
<v Speaker 1>this is a big change by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the way that much of the United </v>

2638
02:34:04.140 --> 02:34:06.310
<v Speaker 1>States government will craft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2639
02:34:06.330 --> 02:34:09.290
<v Speaker 1>the way that they frame relationships </v>
<v Speaker 1>with other countries too.</v>

2640
02:34:09.320 --> 02:34:14.320
<v Speaker 1>I got nothing against the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the government and Wilson's point </v>

2641
02:34:14.320 --> 02:34:17.631
<v Speaker 1>of view is if the people aren't running </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government like in a democracy or a </v>

2642
02:34:17.631 --> 02:34:20.901
<v Speaker 1>republic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then the people aren't responsible </v>

2643
02:34:20.901 --> 02:34:20.901
<v Speaker 1>for what their government's decisions </v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

2644
02:34:20.901 --> 02:34:24.991
<v Speaker 1>They may be the victims of it and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>might have to hurt you in order to </v>

2645
02:34:24.991 --> 02:34:28.321
<v Speaker 1>overthrow your government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're not mad at you about half this</v>

2646
02:34:29.451 --> 02:34:34.451
<v Speaker 1>speech is really high minded sentiments </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever known afterwards as Wilsonian </v>

2647
02:34:34.791 --> 02:34:39.791
<v Speaker 1>principles that talk about things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the need to make the world safe for </v>

2648
02:34:39.831 --> 02:34:44.831
<v Speaker 1>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll give you a taste of that in a </v>

2649
02:34:44.831 --> 02:34:44.831
<v Speaker 1>second but more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

2650
02:34:44.831 --> 02:34:48.851
<v Speaker 1>one of the more groundbreaking parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this speech is that Wilson takes on the </v>

2651
02:34:48.851 --> 02:34:52.301
<v Speaker 1>US tradition of non involvement in </v>
<v Speaker 1>European affairs head on.</v>

2652
02:34:53.790 --> 02:34:57.120
<v Speaker 1>And he basically said that was the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

2653
02:34:57.330 --> 02:35:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Times have changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the exact phrasing that he gives,</v>

2654
02:35:01.350 --> 02:35:06.350
<v Speaker 1>but it is a sea change in American </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy and the way the </v>

2655
02:35:06.350 --> 02:35:09.060
<v Speaker 1>government of the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>approaches the conflicts and involvement</v>

2656
02:35:09.061 --> 02:35:12.690
<v Speaker 1>with the rest of the world and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>course change is one we are still living</v>

2657
02:35:12.691 --> 02:35:17.691
<v Speaker 1>with today in the modern world in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of his speech telling Congress </v>

2658
02:35:17.731 --> 02:35:20.910
<v Speaker 1>that award exists right now in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilson says,</v>

2659
02:35:20.911 --> 02:35:21.330
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

2660
02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:28.320
<v Speaker 1>our object now as then is to vindicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the principles of Peace and justice in </v>

2661
02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:33.301
<v Speaker 1>the life of the world as against selfish</v>
<v Speaker 1>and autocratic power and to set up </v>

2662
02:35:33.301 --> 02:35:36.220
<v Speaker 1>amongst the really free and </v>
<v Speaker 1>self-governed peoples of the world,</v>

2663
02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:39.070
<v Speaker 1>such a concert of purpose into action as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2664
02:35:39.071 --> 02:35:44.071
<v Speaker 1>hence forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ensure the observance of those </v>

2665
02:35:44.071 --> 02:35:46.261
<v Speaker 1>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neutrality is no longer feasible or </v>

2666
02:35:46.261 --> 02:35:48.070
<v Speaker 1>desirable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the peace of the world is involved</v>

2667
02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:52.300
<v Speaker 1>and the freedom of its peoples and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>menace to that peace and freedom lies in</v>

2668
02:35:52.301 --> 02:35:57.301
<v Speaker 1>the existence of autocratic governments </v>
<v Speaker 1>backed by organized force which has </v>

2669
02:35:57.301 --> 02:36:00.100
<v Speaker 1>controlled holy by there will not by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>will of their people.</v>

2670
02:36:00.390 --> 02:36:05.200
<v Speaker 1>We have seen the last of neutrality in </v>
<v Speaker 1>such circumstances were at the beginning</v>

2671
02:36:05.200 --> 02:36:10.200
<v Speaker 1>of an age where it will be insisted that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same standards of conduct and have </v>

2672
02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:13.561
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for wrong done shall be </v>
<v Speaker 1>observed among nations and their </v>

2673
02:36:13.561 --> 02:36:17.550
<v Speaker 1>governments that are observed among the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual citizens of civilized states </v>

2674
02:36:17.550 --> 02:36:22.320
<v Speaker 1>and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a national policy connected to </v>

2675
02:36:22.341 --> 02:36:27.341
<v Speaker 1>the idea of not going abroad in search </v>
<v Speaker 1>of monsters to slay just started to </v>

2676
02:36:27.341 --> 02:36:28.940
<v Speaker 1>sound really old fashioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't it?</v>

2677
02:36:30.470 --> 02:36:35.470
<v Speaker 1>But at least Wilson's got some really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good arguments to justify the historic </v>

2678
02:36:37.070 --> 02:36:42.070
<v Speaker 1>course change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the ideas of wilsonianism and </v>

2679
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:45.620
<v Speaker 1>here's how Wilson annunciates just some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them quote,</v>

2680
02:36:46.160 --> 02:36:49.460
<v Speaker 1>it is a distressing and oppressive duty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gentlemen of the Congress,</v>

2681
02:36:49.610 --> 02:36:51.860
<v Speaker 1>which I have performed in thus </v>
<v Speaker 1>addressing you.</v>

2682
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:55.670
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be many months of fiery trial and</v>

2683
02:36:55.671 --> 02:37:00.671
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice ahead of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a fearful thing to lead this </v>

2684
02:37:00.671 --> 02:37:03.911
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful people into war into the most </v>

2685
02:37:03.911 --> 02:37:06.050
<v Speaker 1>terrible disasters of all wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Civilization itself seeming to be in the</v>

2686
02:37:06.051 --> 02:37:11.051
<v Speaker 1>balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the right is more precious than </v>

2687
02:37:11.051 --> 02:37:12.830
<v Speaker 1>piece and we shall fight for the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>which we have always carried nearest our</v>

2688
02:37:12.831 --> 02:37:15.090
<v Speaker 1>hearts for democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the right,</v>

2689
02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:20.200
<v Speaker 1>those who submit to authority to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice in their own governments for the </v>

2690
02:37:20.200 --> 02:37:23.741
<v Speaker 1>rights and liberties of small nations </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a universal dominion of right by </v>

2691
02:37:23.741 --> 02:37:28.391
<v Speaker 1>such a concert of free peoples as shall </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring peace and safety to all nations </v>

2692
02:37:28.391 --> 02:37:33.040
<v Speaker 1>and make the world itself at last free </v>
<v Speaker 1>to such a task we can dedicate our lives</v>

2693
02:37:33.591 --> 02:37:36.110
<v Speaker 1>and our fortunes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that we are in,</v>

2694
02:37:36.111 --> 02:37:41.111
<v Speaker 1>everything that we have with the pride </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those who know that the day has come </v>

2695
02:37:41.111 --> 02:37:44.330
<v Speaker 1>when America is privileged to spend her </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood and her might,</v>

2696
02:37:44.540 --> 02:37:49.540
<v Speaker 1>for the principles that gave her birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and happiness and the peace which she </v>

2697
02:37:49.540 --> 02:37:50.150
<v Speaker 1>has treasured God helping her.</v>

2698
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:55.150
<v Speaker 1>She can do no other and quote one </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonders what John Quincy Adams would </v>

2699
02:37:56.901 --> 02:38:01.700
<v Speaker 1>reply to that nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guys like Theodore Roosevelt,</v>

2700
02:38:01.701 --> 02:38:06.701
<v Speaker 1>who had been saying he was going to skin</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilson alive if Wilson didn't go to war </v>

2701
02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:08.090
<v Speaker 1>like the speech a lot.</v>

2702
02:38:10.340 --> 02:38:15.340
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to note by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the one American political figure </v>

2703
02:38:15.340 --> 02:38:20.291
<v Speaker 1>that the Europeans really respect in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole question is Theodore </v>

2704
02:38:20.291 --> 02:38:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Theodore Roosevelt is really one</v>

2705
02:38:21.891 --> 02:38:24.500
<v Speaker 1>of the early what will be called Atlanta</v>
<v Speaker 1>cysts.</v>

2706
02:38:24.650 --> 02:38:26.000
<v Speaker 1>People who believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2707
02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:31.120
<v Speaker 1>in locking arms with countries like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Great Britain and doing great things </v>

2708
02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:34.421
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tiara was an interventionist before his </v>

2709
02:38:34.421 --> 02:38:37.580
<v Speaker 1>time and in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's thought of as an extremist.</v>

2710
02:38:37.581 --> 02:38:42.581
<v Speaker 1>The Republican candidate for president </v>
<v Speaker 1>tells him to stop campaigning for him </v>

2711
02:38:42.581 --> 02:38:46.810
<v Speaker 1>because he's so bellicose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's working against the Republican </v>

2712
02:38:46.810 --> 02:38:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2713
02:38:46.810 --> 02:38:48.890
<v Speaker 1>You're letting Wilson and the opposition</v>
<v Speaker 1>portray us as warmongers.</v>

2714
02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:54.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the guy though that appeared to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be ahead of the curve when it came to </v>

2715
02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:56.900
<v Speaker 1>figuring out that Germany needed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealt with.</v>

2716
02:38:57.050 --> 02:38:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the British point of view,</v>

2717
02:38:58.970 --> 02:39:03.970
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of this that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at and say the various things the </v>

2718
02:39:03.970 --> 02:39:06.431
<v Speaker 1>Germans are being slammed for doing are </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they were kind of forced </v>

2719
02:39:06.431 --> 02:39:09.020
<v Speaker 1>into doing by what their opponents were </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to.</v>

2720
02:39:09.860 --> 02:39:12.080
<v Speaker 1>The first world war is not the clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>cut,</v>

2721
02:39:12.081 --> 02:39:15.950
<v Speaker 1>good and evil separation that the Second</v>
<v Speaker 1>World War is,</v>

2722
02:39:16.330 --> 02:39:18.800
<v Speaker 1>and we've mentioned that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

2723
02:39:18.830 --> 02:39:23.830
<v Speaker 1>if you're on one side of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it certainly is the prime minister of </v>

2724
02:39:23.830 --> 02:39:27.581
<v Speaker 1>Great Britain for about a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>months when Wilson makes his historic </v>

2725
02:39:27.581 --> 02:39:30.530
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Lloyd George in his memoirs,</v>

2726
02:39:30.710 --> 02:39:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Lloyd George Writing after the war can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>help but take a shot at Wilson,</v>

2727
02:39:36.770 --> 02:39:41.770
<v Speaker 1>not because of what he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of how long it took him </v>

2728
02:39:41.770 --> 02:39:42.800
<v Speaker 1>speaking about Wilson's speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2729
02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:44.240
<v Speaker 1>George writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

2730
02:39:45.350 --> 02:39:48.710
<v Speaker 1>these principles were excellent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>excellently expressed.</v>

2731
02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:53.920
<v Speaker 1>The ally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democracies are France and the British </v>

2732
02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:56.081
<v Speaker 1>Commonwealth had already borne the </v>
<v Speaker 1>burden and been scorched by the heat of </v>

2733
02:39:56.081 --> 02:39:59.330
<v Speaker 1>a thousand days in the battle with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural flow to liberty,</v>

2734
02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:03.650
<v Speaker 1>stealing one of Wilson's lines from his </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech they rejoiced.</v>

2735
02:40:03.710 --> 02:40:08.710
<v Speaker 1>George does at the advent of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful help from the greatest </v>

2736
02:40:08.710 --> 02:40:10.550
<v Speaker 1>democracy in the world at a time when </v>
<v Speaker 1>troubles were multiplying,</v>

2737
02:40:10.820 --> 02:40:12.980
<v Speaker 1>they perhaps might be excused for </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

2738
02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:18.200
<v Speaker 1>That issue is so clear now to President </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilson ought to have been apparent </v>

2739
02:40:18.200 --> 02:40:21.830
<v Speaker 1>earlier to his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They felt grateful in their hearts to </v>

2740
02:40:21.830 --> 02:40:24.891
<v Speaker 1>the great American Theodore Roosevelt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose vision was so undimmed and who </v>

2741
02:40:24.891 --> 02:40:29.731
<v Speaker 1>sympathies were so sure from the outset </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this grim struggle for international </v>

2742
02:40:29.731 --> 02:40:33.411
<v Speaker 1>right and quote Winston Churchill </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounded almost the exact same way.</v>

2743
02:40:34.381 --> 02:40:38.100
<v Speaker 1>What took you so long?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of Wilson's piece,</v>

2744
02:40:38.130 --> 02:40:43.130
<v Speaker 1>attitudes quote he had behind his policy</v>
<v Speaker 1>or reason to explanation and massive </v>

2745
02:40:44.071 --> 02:40:49.071
<v Speaker 1>argument and all must respect the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motives of a statesman who seeks to </v>

2746
02:40:49.071 --> 02:40:50.760
<v Speaker 1>spare his country the waste and horrors </v>
<v Speaker 1>of war,</v>

2747
02:40:51.060 --> 02:40:52.710
<v Speaker 1>but nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill writes,</v>

2748
02:40:52.920 --> 02:40:55.470
<v Speaker 1>can reconcile what he said after March </v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

2749
02:40:55.471 --> 02:40:59.550
<v Speaker 1>17 with a guidance he had given before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he did in April,</v>

2750
02:40:59.551 --> 02:41:00.630
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17.</v>

2751
02:41:00.631 --> 02:41:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Could have been done in May 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15.</v>

2752
02:41:03.030 --> 02:41:06.000
<v Speaker 1>And if done then what abridgment of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>slaughter,</v>

2753
02:41:06.060 --> 02:41:08.520
<v Speaker 1>what sparing of the agony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what ruined,</v>

2754
02:41:08.521 --> 02:41:12.540
<v Speaker 1>what catastrophes would've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevented in how many million homes with</v>

2755
02:41:12.541 --> 02:41:17.541
<v Speaker 1>an empty chair be occupied today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How different would be the shattered </v>

2756
02:41:17.541 --> 02:41:20.780
<v Speaker 1>world in which victor and vanquished </v>
<v Speaker 1>alike are condemned to live and quote,</v>

2757
02:41:21.570 --> 02:41:26.570
<v Speaker 1>writing from the late 19 twenties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing the mortally wounded and terribly</v>

2758
02:41:27.301 --> 02:41:32.301
<v Speaker 1>scarred continent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which Winston Churchill remembers as </v>

2759
02:41:32.301 --> 02:41:35.100
<v Speaker 1>being the height of world civilization </v>
<v Speaker 1>to him.</v>

2760
02:41:35.101 --> 02:41:40.101
<v Speaker 1>The US taking this long to get into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war looks like something that costs you </v>

2761
02:41:40.171 --> 02:41:41.550
<v Speaker 1>the world you knew</v>

2762
02:41:45.280 --> 02:41:48.610
<v Speaker 1>a couple of days after the president </v>
<v Speaker 1>gives his famous speech,</v>

2763
02:41:48.970 --> 02:41:52.390
<v Speaker 1>the Congress votes to support him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the nation to war.</v>

2764
02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:55.420
<v Speaker 1>The vote wasn't close by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the House of Representatives,</v>

2765
02:41:55.421 --> 02:42:00.421
<v Speaker 1>it was something like 374 or 375 to 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as much as a wipe out as that </v>

2766
02:42:01.601 --> 02:42:06.601
<v Speaker 1>sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read somewhere that that's the second </v>

2767
02:42:06.601 --> 02:42:09.151
<v Speaker 1>most opposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The congress has ever shown the </v>

2768
02:42:09.151 --> 02:42:09.151
<v Speaker 1>president in a war vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The war of 18,</v>

2769
02:42:09.151 --> 02:42:13.771
<v Speaker 1>12 being the most nonetheless seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty clear that most of those people </v>

2770
02:42:15.161 --> 02:42:20.161
<v Speaker 1>voting or unsure about what voting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to war was going to mean the </v>

2771
02:42:20.321 --> 02:42:25.321
<v Speaker 1>future mayor of New York fiero Laguardia</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a congressmen when this vote was </v>

2772
02:42:25.321 --> 02:42:27.430
<v Speaker 1>taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said that 60 percent,</v>

2773
02:42:27.431 --> 02:42:29.880
<v Speaker 1>he said 30 years after the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that 60 percent of his brethren,</v>

2774
02:42:29.890 --> 02:42:32.980
<v Speaker 1>we're pretty sure this wasn't going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean troops on the ground in Europe.</v>

2775
02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:36.250
<v Speaker 1>The US didn't send armies overseas to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

2776
02:42:36.350 --> 02:42:37.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on European soil.</v>

2777
02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:40.930
<v Speaker 1>They thought it was going to be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial aid and naval help.</v>

2778
02:42:43.110 --> 02:42:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Naval helped is the one thing that us </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do right away.</v>

2779
02:42:46.050 --> 02:42:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Military Health and an army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem because the US really </v>

2780
02:42:51.050 --> 02:42:51.050
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have one.</v>

2781
02:42:52.110 --> 02:42:52.860
<v Speaker 1>In April,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

2782
02:42:52.861 --> 02:42:56.430
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US army's ranked 17th largest in the</v>

2783
02:42:56.431 --> 02:43:01.431
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't have any flame throwers or any </v>

2784
02:43:01.431 --> 02:43:05.730
<v Speaker 1>tanks or any gas masks or mortars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no grenades.</v>

2785
02:43:06.330 --> 02:43:11.330
<v Speaker 1>The aircraft are these rickety strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>beasts that you the right bread,</v>

2786
02:43:13.060 --> 02:43:18.060
<v Speaker 1>they look like the planes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Wright brothers kind of put </v>

2787
02:43:18.060 --> 02:43:18.060
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't look modern at all.</v>

2788
02:43:19.150 --> 02:43:24.150
<v Speaker 1>There's not enough artillery shells for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guns to shoot more than a few </v>

2789
02:43:24.150 --> 02:43:25.170
<v Speaker 1>minutes by western front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2790
02:43:25.171 --> 02:43:25.930
<v Speaker 1>standards.</v>

2791
02:43:27.380 --> 02:43:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Historian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice donut key says that the US </v>

2792
02:43:32.380 --> 02:43:35.780
<v Speaker 1>relatively speaking had been better </v>
<v Speaker 1>prepared for the American revolution and</v>

2793
02:43:35.781 --> 02:43:39.770
<v Speaker 1>the war of 1812 than they were prepared </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first world war.</v>

2794
02:43:40.670 --> 02:43:44.090
<v Speaker 1>I disagree with him about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his point is well taken.</v>

2795
02:43:44.510 --> 02:43:46.970
<v Speaker 1>The United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's going to be any help to Europe,</v>

2796
02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Europe's going to have to survive while </v>
<v Speaker 1>it waits for this help to be </v>

2797
02:43:52.190 --> 02:43:55.481
<v Speaker 1>accumulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only place that us can help right </v>

2798
02:43:55.481 --> 02:43:55.790
<v Speaker 1>away is with money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they were kind of doing already.</v>

2799
02:43:55.791 --> 02:43:57.980
<v Speaker 1>They're going to lower interest rates </v>
<v Speaker 1>and give better deals,</v>

2800
02:43:57.981 --> 02:44:02.981
<v Speaker 1>but it's a continuation of what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>already happening and the use of the </v>

2801
02:44:02.981 --> 02:44:06.521
<v Speaker 1>navy and the thing the navy can do right</v>
<v Speaker 1>away is held against the submarines </v>

2802
02:44:06.521 --> 02:44:09.080
<v Speaker 1>because as we said in April 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>

2803
02:44:09.260 --> 02:44:12.740
<v Speaker 1>the submarine sink more than 400 </v>
<v Speaker 1>merchant ships.</v>

2804
02:44:13.940 --> 02:44:16.700
<v Speaker 1>Britain's problem isn't that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to stop all the sinking.</v>

2805
02:44:16.700 --> 02:44:21.700
<v Speaker 1>It has to stop the rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is so much more than what it can </v>

2806
02:44:21.700 --> 02:44:22.280
<v Speaker 1>rebuild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it loses less ships than it can build</v>

2807
02:44:22.281 --> 02:44:23.210
<v Speaker 1>a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's doing well.</v>

2808
02:44:23.211 --> 02:44:25.160
<v Speaker 1>If it loses more shifts than it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>build a month,</v>

2809
02:44:25.161 --> 02:44:28.730
<v Speaker 1>it's in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The height of this submarine war will be</v>

2810
02:44:28.731 --> 02:44:31.970
<v Speaker 1>from February 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17 when unrestricted warfare is declared</v>

2811
02:44:32.120 --> 02:44:36.020
<v Speaker 1>and the next eight months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is when Britain lives or dies.</v>

2812
02:44:36.021 --> 02:44:41.021
<v Speaker 1>Those are the stakes and Lloyd George </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Churchill and all these guys go out </v>

2813
02:44:41.021 --> 02:44:44.771
<v Speaker 1>of their way to talk about the almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>alarm is the word Lloyd George's is </v>

2814
02:44:44.771 --> 02:44:48.910
<v Speaker 1>Lloyd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George says that there are some of the </v>

2815
02:44:48.910 --> 02:44:50.861
<v Speaker 1>most cautious people in his cabinet that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are starting to muse out loud about </v>

2816
02:44:50.861 --> 02:44:52.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe we better make peace while we </v>
<v Speaker 1>still have some ships afloat,</v>

2817
02:44:54.110 --> 02:44:59.110
<v Speaker 1>and he says the Germans were getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>gleeful that at times they just had </v>

2818
02:44:59.110 --> 02:45:02.651
<v Speaker 1>these reports coming in that made all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pro sub marine people seem to be </v>

2819
02:45:02.651 --> 02:45:07.301
<v Speaker 1>perfectly correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were all of a sudden going to win </v>

2820
02:45:07.301 --> 02:45:07.301
<v Speaker 1>the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill said,</v>

2821
02:45:07.301 --> 02:45:07.340
<v Speaker 1>we went from being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2822
02:45:07.341 --> 02:45:10.700
<v Speaker 1>the side that had time on our side and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we could just wait this out and everyday</v>

2823
02:45:10.760 --> 02:45:15.760
<v Speaker 1>the Germans were losing the war a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit more to having the tables flipped </v>

2824
02:45:15.760 --> 02:45:19.031
<v Speaker 1>and now time was on the German side and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the British had to come up with </v>

2825
02:45:19.031 --> 02:45:22.031
<v Speaker 1>countermeasures or lose the war fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They not only did this,</v>

2826
02:45:22.550 --> 02:45:26.000
<v Speaker 1>but it was the civilian leadership that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed for the answer that turned out to</v>

2827
02:45:26.001 --> 02:45:31.001
<v Speaker 1>make the biggest difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is sort of one of these early </v>

2828
02:45:31.001 --> 02:45:31.610
<v Speaker 1>indications that something is changing </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the war.</v>

2829
02:45:32.150 --> 02:45:37.150
<v Speaker 1>For years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the military men have had an almost </v>

2830
02:45:37.150 --> 02:45:39.670
<v Speaker 1>unquestioned authority to choose </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever path for fighting the war they </v>

2831
02:45:39.670 --> 02:45:40.700
<v Speaker 1>wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what happened,</v>

2832
02:45:41.090 --> 02:45:46.090
<v Speaker 1>but now so many people had died and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many disasters and so much of the same </v>

2833
02:45:46.090 --> 02:45:49.991
<v Speaker 1>tactic seeming to equal the same results</v>
<v Speaker 1>except more bodies stacking higher and </v>

2834
02:45:49.991 --> 02:45:52.340
<v Speaker 1>higher that that there was pushback now </v>
<v Speaker 1>from civilian leaders.</v>

2835
02:45:52.550 --> 02:45:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Lloyd George and Britain is one of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys who's who says openly that my job </v>

2836
02:45:57.550 --> 02:45:59.690
<v Speaker 1>is to protect the soldier in the field </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to the soldier in the field,</v>

2837
02:45:59.691 --> 02:46:01.580
<v Speaker 1>the generals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his biggest enemy sometimes,</v>

2838
02:46:01.790 --> 02:46:04.790
<v Speaker 1>and you could hear all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about the stupidity of the military</v>

2839
02:46:04.791 --> 02:46:09.791
<v Speaker 1>leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even Churchill kind of goes out of his </v>

2840
02:46:09.791 --> 02:46:11.891
<v Speaker 1>way to say that the military experts all</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the solution that ended up </v>

2841
02:46:11.891 --> 02:46:14.240
<v Speaker 1>solving the sub problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the civilian leaders for the most</v>

2842
02:46:14.241 --> 02:46:17.090
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pushed the idea that won the day.</v>

2843
02:46:17.330 --> 02:46:21.770
<v Speaker 1>The idea was both breathtakingly simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>and incredibly complex.</v>

2844
02:46:22.250 --> 02:46:27.250
<v Speaker 1>The idea was convoys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grouping of ships into large </v>

2845
02:46:28.690 --> 02:46:33.690
<v Speaker 1>formations surrounding them with war </v>
<v Speaker 1>ships and escorts and sending these </v>

2846
02:46:33.690 --> 02:46:38.110
<v Speaker 1>large bodies of ships across at </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized times and schedules.</v>

2847
02:46:39.370 --> 02:46:44.370
<v Speaker 1>The military men often believed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this was just going to group your </v>

2848
02:46:44.370 --> 02:46:47.341
<v Speaker 1>targets for the submarines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it even easier to align ships up </v>

2849
02:46:47.341 --> 02:46:50.050
<v Speaker 1>like in a shooting gallery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it was experimented on again,</v>

2850
02:46:50.051 --> 02:46:52.870
<v Speaker 1>the civilian leaders pushing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment with this.</v>

2851
02:46:53.170 --> 02:46:55.930
<v Speaker 1>The results were fantastic almost right </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

2852
02:46:57.800 --> 02:46:58.910
<v Speaker 1>The u boats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that approach,</v>

2853
02:46:58.911 --> 02:47:00.950
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of formations often got </v>
<v Speaker 1>sunk.</v>

2854
02:47:01.370 --> 02:47:06.370
<v Speaker 1>The idea that it was going to be easier </v>
<v Speaker 1>to spot 50 or 60 ships on the water </v>

2855
02:47:06.370 --> 02:47:10.511
<v Speaker 1>rather than a single ship turned out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>not be true in the vast spaces of the </v>

2856
02:47:10.511 --> 02:47:14.201
<v Speaker 1>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Ole convoys got swallowed up to and </v>

2857
02:47:14.201 --> 02:47:17.411
<v Speaker 1>as Churchill said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when these convoys made it across the </v>

2858
02:47:17.411 --> 02:47:20.321
<v Speaker 1>water and slipped through the blockade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of having one ship make it </v>

2859
02:47:20.321 --> 02:47:20.321
<v Speaker 1>through the German blockade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had 40,</v>

2860
02:47:20.321 --> 02:47:21.170
<v Speaker 1>50 or 60 ships do it</v>

2861
02:47:23.210 --> 02:47:28.210
<v Speaker 1>by October 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17 of 99 convoys heading to Great </v>

2862
02:47:28.210 --> 02:47:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Britain with more than 1500 ships in </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2863
02:47:31.340 --> 02:47:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Only 10 that were still part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>convoy,</v>

2864
02:47:34.461 --> 02:47:38.690
<v Speaker 1>we're sunk 14 more that it straight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>got lost.</v>

2865
02:47:38.691 --> 02:47:43.160
<v Speaker 1>We're sunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are easily replaceable losses.</v>

2866
02:47:43.760 --> 02:47:48.760
<v Speaker 1>And by October 1917,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was clear that the Germans were no </v>

2867
02:47:48.760 --> 02:47:52.661
<v Speaker 1>longer going to be able to sink more </v>
<v Speaker 1>shipping than the British could replace </v>

2868
02:47:52.661 --> 02:47:57.520
<v Speaker 1>what's more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They now had us ship yards helping to </v>

2869
02:47:57.520 --> 02:47:59.640
<v Speaker 1>replace them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you might imagine,</v>

2870
02:47:59.641 --> 02:48:04.590
<v Speaker 1>the whole decision on Germany's part to </v>
<v Speaker 1>engage in this kind of submarine warfare</v>

2871
02:48:04.591 --> 02:48:08.850
<v Speaker 1>is one of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not the most criticized decision that</v>

2872
02:48:08.851 --> 02:48:13.410
<v Speaker 1>the German leadership ever made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's understandable and you know,</v>

2873
02:48:13.411 --> 02:48:18.411
<v Speaker 1>it kind of once again puts the lie to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stereotype of the Germans as sort </v>

2874
02:48:18.411 --> 02:48:20.300
<v Speaker 1>of applauding methodical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>

2875
02:48:20.560 --> 02:48:21.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2876
02:48:21.700 --> 02:48:25.490
<v Speaker 1>conservative sort of leadership style </v>
<v Speaker 1>because in both were awards,</v>

2877
02:48:25.491 --> 02:48:28.550
<v Speaker 1>the Germans would prove to be great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great gamblers.</v>

2878
02:48:29.030 --> 02:48:32.950
<v Speaker 1>They just weren't lucky gamblers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were willing many times to sort</v>

2879
02:48:32.951 --> 02:48:34.970
<v Speaker 1>of throw caution to the wind and try </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

2880
02:48:35.180 --> 02:48:40.180
<v Speaker 1>In a sense though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a defense mechanism when you are </v>

2881
02:48:40.180 --> 02:48:40.180
<v Speaker 1>the weaker party</v>

2882
02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:45.440
<v Speaker 1>mean to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the analogy that works best in the in </v>

2883
02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:48.111
<v Speaker 1>the war that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have going right now is to </v>

2884
02:48:48.111 --> 02:48:50.991
<v Speaker 1>weight lifters competing against each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and one of these weightlifters is </v>

2885
02:48:50.991 --> 02:48:54.921
<v Speaker 1>bigger and stronger than the other one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously a huge advantage in </v>

2886
02:48:54.921 --> 02:48:55.350
<v Speaker 1>weightlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't.</v>

2887
02:48:55.351 --> 02:48:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Everything on the weaker weightlifter </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to try,</v>

2888
02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:04.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make up for it with technique and </v>

2889
02:49:04.660 --> 02:49:04.660
<v Speaker 1>training and will to win</v>

2890
02:49:05.450 --> 02:49:10.450
<v Speaker 1>and maybe taking some chances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Germany strategy for the rest of </v>

2891
02:49:10.450 --> 02:49:10.970
<v Speaker 1>this war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2892
02:49:10.971 --> 02:49:15.971
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing so many aspects of change </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the 19th century to the 20th </v>

2893
02:49:16.321 --> 02:49:18.120
<v Speaker 1>century that you can point to in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

2894
02:49:18.121 --> 02:49:20.460
<v Speaker 1>Because that's really the theme when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this war.</v>

2895
02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:22.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a big picture sense.</v>

2896
02:49:22.710 --> 02:49:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Germany has transformed in the recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>past 1916 the year before this time.</v>

2897
02:49:26.941 --> 02:49:31.170
<v Speaker 1>We're in now from really an old style </v>
<v Speaker 1>monarchy with legislative,</v>

2898
02:49:31.220 --> 02:49:32.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>balancing out to,</v>

2899
02:49:32.430 --> 02:49:36.210
<v Speaker 1>to something that looks much more like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century military dictatorship.</v>

2900
02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:41.720
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't happen overnight and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost kind of happens because it needs </v>

2901
02:49:41.720 --> 02:49:44.931
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way Germany has a chance in </v>

2902
02:49:44.931 --> 02:49:46.980
<v Speaker 1>this war is to be the technique master </v>
<v Speaker 1>and have the greater will to win.</v>

2903
02:49:46.981 --> 02:49:48.750
<v Speaker 1>All those things I said about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller weightlifter.</v>

2904
02:49:49.020 --> 02:49:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Germany has to organize it society more </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiently than the more powerful </v>

2905
02:49:54.020 --> 02:49:54.540
<v Speaker 1>allied countries.</v>

2906
02:49:54.540 --> 02:49:59.540
<v Speaker 1>If it's going to stand a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that happens is </v>

2907
02:49:59.540 --> 02:49:59.540
<v Speaker 1>when you get Hindenburg and Ludendorff </v>
<v Speaker 1>in there,</v>

2908
02:49:59.540 --> 02:50:02.940
<v Speaker 1>remember the two German commanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about this military team,</v>

2909
02:50:02.941 --> 02:50:05.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's really only one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Luton Dorf guy.</v>

2910
02:50:05.820 --> 02:50:09.540
<v Speaker 1>He takes on more and more the powers </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the 20th century we see over and</v>

2911
02:50:09.541 --> 02:50:14.541
<v Speaker 1>over again in regimes where you have one</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong man who sort of has dictatorial </v>

2912
02:50:14.541 --> 02:50:19.071
<v Speaker 1>control and the Germans start to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize their society to make it more </v>

2913
02:50:19.071 --> 02:50:19.071
<v Speaker 1>efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2914
02:50:19.071 --> 02:50:20.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to tell workers where they're</v>

2915
02:50:20.641 --> 02:50:21.870
<v Speaker 1>going to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2916
02:50:21.871 --> 02:50:26.871
<v Speaker 1>controlling people down to that level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because as one of the German leaders </v>

2917
02:50:26.871 --> 02:50:31.031
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goal is to turn Germany into one </v>

2918
02:50:31.031 --> 02:50:33.771
<v Speaker 1>vast munitions factory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To do that requires a sort of single </v>

2919
02:50:33.771 --> 02:50:37.200
<v Speaker 1>mindedness and and a lot of power </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrated in one person at this stage</v>

2920
02:50:37.201 --> 02:50:37.560
<v Speaker 1>in the war.</v>

2921
02:50:37.560 --> 02:50:42.560
<v Speaker 1>That person is Ludina doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He and Hindenburg took over in 1916 and </v>

2922
02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:46.491
<v Speaker 1>the first thing they did was sort of do </v>
<v Speaker 1>an audit of how the war is going and </v>

2923
02:50:46.491 --> 02:50:47.280
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing to fight it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>

2924
02:50:47.670 --> 02:50:52.670
<v Speaker 1>And the first condition you noticed when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take over the entire war is on the </v>

2925
02:50:52.670 --> 02:50:56.421
<v Speaker 1>western front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have about two and a half million </v>

2926
02:50:56.421 --> 02:50:59.871
<v Speaker 1>men manning the barricades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other side has about 4 million men </v>

2927
02:50:59.871 --> 02:51:01.650
<v Speaker 1>and their numbers are increasing every </v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

2928
02:51:01.651 --> 02:51:06.030
<v Speaker 1>How do those trends look?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have food riots at home.</v>

2929
02:51:06.031 --> 02:51:11.031
<v Speaker 1>Women fighting with police officers in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the streets because they can't get the </v>

2930
02:51:11.031 --> 02:51:14.100
<v Speaker 1>food they need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have strikes in a bunch of the major</v>

2931
02:51:14.101 --> 02:51:19.101
<v Speaker 1>firms and in a bunch of the cities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get so bad sometimes the army has </v>

2932
02:51:19.101 --> 02:51:19.980
<v Speaker 1>to be called in to disperse the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strikers,</v>

2933
02:51:20.880 --> 02:51:25.880
<v Speaker 1>so the government is now going in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sending strike leaders to the front to </v>

2934
02:51:25.880 --> 02:51:25.880
<v Speaker 1>get them out of the way.</v>

2935
02:51:25.880 --> 02:51:30.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the society is under severe stress and </v>

2936
02:51:30.680 --> 02:51:30.680
<v Speaker 1>we already talked about the food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2937
02:51:30.680 --> 02:51:34.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a quote from earns glazer that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sums it up when he talks about this</v>

2938
02:51:34.261 --> 02:51:35.700
<v Speaker 1>period they're in now and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

2939
02:51:35.701 --> 02:51:37.770
<v Speaker 1>quote soon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alluded ham,</v>

2940
02:51:37.771 --> 02:51:42.771
<v Speaker 1>thrilled us more than the fall of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bucharest or some of parents success </v>

2941
02:51:42.771 --> 02:51:46.251
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to quote these people's needs have </v>

2942
02:51:46.251 --> 02:51:47.700
<v Speaker 1>shrunk down to the most basic human </v>
<v Speaker 1>survival levels.</v>

2943
02:51:48.300 --> 02:51:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

2944
02:51:48.871 --> 02:51:51.030
<v Speaker 1>We took Bucharest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but did you see that hand we have in the</v>

2945
02:51:51.031 --> 02:51:52.200
<v Speaker 1>cellar that we found?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2946
02:51:52.201 --> 02:51:57.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something any of us could </v>

2947
02:51:57.201 --> 02:51:59.661
<v Speaker 1>understand if we began to starve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pressure is on Germany's military </v>

2948
02:51:59.661 --> 02:52:04.221
<v Speaker 1>leadership to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't very well launching offensive </v>

2949
02:52:04.221 --> 02:52:04.290
<v Speaker 1>on the western front when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>outnumbered the way you are,</v>

2950
02:52:04.291 --> 02:52:06.010
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be lucky to survive at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

2951
02:52:06.170 --> 02:52:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 16 was terrible for the Germans</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the western front,</v>

2952
02:52:08.920 --> 02:52:13.920
<v Speaker 1>so you launch the submarines and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes your chance to win the war </v>

2953
02:52:13.920 --> 02:52:16.240
<v Speaker 1>without having to do the impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the western front.</v>

2954
02:52:17.870 --> 02:52:21.170
<v Speaker 1>Now alluded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dorf is a very strange guy.</v>

2955
02:52:21.171 --> 02:52:23.000
<v Speaker 1>This is commander of Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2956
02:52:23.001 --> 02:52:25.910
<v Speaker 1>sort of in more every day in this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hindenburg,</v>

2957
02:52:25.911 --> 02:52:29.030
<v Speaker 1>his partner is the charisma guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's an old man.</v>

2958
02:52:29.031 --> 02:52:34.031
<v Speaker 1>He really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he had been great at one time in his </v>

2959
02:52:34.031 --> 02:52:34.031
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's in his dotage now and he's,</v>

2960
02:52:34.031 --> 02:52:36.020
<v Speaker 1>he's the revered public face of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

2961
02:52:36.021 --> 02:52:41.021
<v Speaker 1>but lewd indoors doors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy behind the scenes and we talked </v>

2962
02:52:41.021 --> 02:52:42.050
<v Speaker 1>about him and he's the one who way back </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1914,</v>

2963
02:52:42.051 --> 02:52:47.051
<v Speaker 1>got that city in Belgium to surrender by</v>
<v Speaker 1>banging on the front doors with the hilt</v>

2964
02:52:47.271 --> 02:52:48.740
<v Speaker 1>of his sword,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2965
02:52:48.760 --> 02:52:53.760
<v Speaker 1>when he easily could have been killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walked right up to the front door loan </v>

2966
02:52:53.760 --> 02:52:53.760
<v Speaker 1>guide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2967
02:52:53.760 --> 02:52:54.380
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an interesting guy.</v>

2968
02:52:54.590 --> 02:52:59.590
<v Speaker 1>He's flawed in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And depending on which historian you </v>

2969
02:52:59.590 --> 02:52:59.590
<v Speaker 1>grabbed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your going to hear the,</v>

2970
02:52:59.590 --> 02:53:00.800
<v Speaker 1>the bumbling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2971
02:53:00.890 --> 02:53:05.890
<v Speaker 1>psychologically fragile Luton door for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see this is great </v>

2972
02:53:05.890 --> 02:53:05.890
<v Speaker 1>gambler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was,</v>

2973
02:53:05.890 --> 02:53:07.550
<v Speaker 1>who was fantastic at certain things.</v>

2974
02:53:07.550 --> 02:53:10.330
<v Speaker 1>And remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these generals are 19th century men.</v>

2975
02:53:10.890 --> 02:53:15.650
<v Speaker 1>They are adapting under fire at a quick </v>
<v Speaker 1>pace to all these new conditions.</v>

2976
02:53:15.890 --> 02:53:17.570
<v Speaker 1>And just when you think they are getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2977
02:53:17.780 --> 02:53:22.780
<v Speaker 1>some new development comes around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're starting to understand the </v>

2978
02:53:22.780 --> 02:53:23.450
<v Speaker 1>physics of land warfare a year or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the first world war.</v>

2979
02:53:23.451 --> 02:53:26.990
<v Speaker 1>If you're a general and then tanks </v>
<v Speaker 1>appear and then gas appears.</v>

2980
02:53:26.991 --> 02:53:28.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with all this airplane?</v>

2981
02:53:28.581 --> 02:53:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Start having a real impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't just have to learn.</v>

2982
02:53:31.670 --> 02:53:36.670
<v Speaker 1>You have to be flexible to continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolve as these generals and nobody's </v>

2983
02:53:36.670 --> 02:53:37.880
<v Speaker 1>great at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luton doors,</v>

2984
02:53:37.881 --> 02:53:41.430
<v Speaker 1>not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ludendorff changes.</v>

2985
02:53:41.431 --> 02:53:46.431
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic strategy of the guy who came </v>

2986
02:53:46.431 --> 02:53:46.470
<v Speaker 1>before him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fun Falcon Heights strategy was,</v>

2987
02:53:46.560 --> 02:53:51.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically defend every inch of </v>

2988
02:53:51.560 --> 02:53:51.560
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luton.</v>

2989
02:53:51.560 --> 02:53:54.561
<v Speaker 1>Dorf is perfectly willing to give up </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory in exchange for killing </v>

2990
02:53:54.561 --> 02:53:54.561
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2991
02:53:54.750 --> 02:53:59.750
<v Speaker 1>He'll pull off things like operation </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alberico right about this time period </v>

2992
02:53:59.750 --> 02:54:03.600
<v Speaker 1>starts in late February,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1917 where he will pull back troops that</v>

2993
02:54:03.601 --> 02:54:06.150
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are in unexposed loop in the line.</v>

2994
02:54:06.151 --> 02:54:08.670
<v Speaker 1>The line isn't straight because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting here and there.</v>

2995
02:54:08.910 --> 02:54:11.550
<v Speaker 1>It's bulging out in some places and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are kinks in it.</v>

2996
02:54:11.700 --> 02:54:15.120
<v Speaker 1>And he begins in early 1917 to pull </v>
<v Speaker 1>troops back that are,</v>

2997
02:54:15.300 --> 02:54:18.690
<v Speaker 1>that are way out there in no man's land </v>
<v Speaker 1>and straightened up his line.</v>

2998
02:54:18.691 --> 02:54:22.380
<v Speaker 1>He'll cut off like 25 miles from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>western front by doing this,</v>

2999
02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:28.040
<v Speaker 1>freeing up 13 or 14 divisions as </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically a German army to be used </v>

3000
02:54:28.040 --> 02:54:28.470
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere.</v>

3001
02:54:29.440 --> 02:54:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a complicated maneuver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his strategy in 1917 as far as he's </v>

3002
02:54:34.440 --> 02:54:35.440
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be defense.</v>

3003
02:54:35.860 --> 02:54:38.680
<v Speaker 1>So he's going to line things up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>prepare for that.</v>

3004
02:54:38.681 --> 02:54:40.420
<v Speaker 1>And it gives him all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantages.</v>

3005
02:54:40.421 --> 02:54:45.421
<v Speaker 1>This is one area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be called the Hindenburg line </v>

3006
02:54:45.421 --> 02:54:48.250
<v Speaker 1>that he puts together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to imagine making the defenses</v>

3007
02:54:48.251 --> 02:54:53.140
<v Speaker 1>of 1916 deeper and stronger and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>impenetrable,</v>

3008
02:54:53.170 --> 02:54:58.170
<v Speaker 1>but that's what they do in 1917.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hindenburg line is an example of </v>

3009
02:54:58.170 --> 02:54:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Luton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doris idea of defense in depth.</v>

3010
02:54:59.951 --> 02:55:04.951
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is as the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>defenses go back and they're designed to</v>

3011
02:55:05.721 --> 02:55:08.660
<v Speaker 1>act like a rubber band so that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>something runs into them,</v>

3012
02:55:08.900 --> 02:55:10.700
<v Speaker 1>it just stretches and stretches and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretches,</v>

3013
02:55:10.701 --> 02:55:13.430
<v Speaker 1>and the farther it stretches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more resistance you find.</v>

3014
02:55:13.670 --> 02:55:18.670
<v Speaker 1>And then eventually just snaps back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's devious mean the way it's designed </v>

3015
02:55:19.370 --> 02:55:20.990
<v Speaker 1>and I don't need to get into all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>details.</v>

3016
02:55:21.020 --> 02:55:26.020
<v Speaker 1>It's the machine guns and the barbed </v>
<v Speaker 1>wire and the pillboxes and all these </v>

3017
02:55:26.020 --> 02:55:28.901
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they just go far back into the </v>

3018
02:55:28.901 --> 02:55:31.241
<v Speaker 1>distance and there's no more trenches </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere near the front lines because </v>

3019
02:55:31.241 --> 02:55:34.511
<v Speaker 1>those are too easy to pick out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody just sort of sits in holes in </v>

3020
02:55:34.511 --> 02:55:36.920
<v Speaker 1>the ground and the sort of a random </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern and there's no line.</v>

3021
02:55:37.820 --> 02:55:42.820
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's hardly any Germans when you </v>

3022
02:55:42.820 --> 02:55:44.591
<v Speaker 1>first get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a few Germans holding you up </v>

3023
02:55:44.591 --> 02:55:45.860
<v Speaker 1>and taking casualties and then as soon </v>
<v Speaker 1>as they can't keep you at bay anymore,</v>

3024
02:55:46.010 --> 02:55:51.010
<v Speaker 1>they retreat back to the next line and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then do the next line and every step of </v>

3025
02:55:51.010 --> 02:55:55.001
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The defenses are a little bit stronger </v>

3026
02:55:55.001 --> 02:55:55.001
<v Speaker 1>and the Germans are a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>numerous.</v>

3027
02:55:55.001 --> 02:55:58.220
<v Speaker 1>As the British or the French who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking them are getting less and less</v>

3028
02:55:58.221 --> 02:56:00.680
<v Speaker 1>numerous and then as they're getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>more tired.</v>

3029
02:56:00.680 --> 02:56:01.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought to myself,</v>

3030
02:56:01.820 --> 02:56:04.610
<v Speaker 1>some of these defenses go back nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 miles.</v>

3031
02:56:04.670 --> 02:56:09.670
<v Speaker 1>It would kill me without any resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine trying to do it with machine </v>

3032
02:56:09.670 --> 02:56:14.220
<v Speaker 1>guns and rifle fire and grenades and </v>
<v Speaker 1>artillery and I mean it just,</v>

3033
02:56:14.270 --> 02:56:19.270
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't imagine having much left </v>

3034
02:56:19.270 --> 02:56:21.920
<v Speaker 1>if you even get the nine or 10 miles to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the defenses and then waiting</v>

3035
02:56:21.921 --> 02:56:26.090
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are German armies who are going to</v>

3036
02:56:26.091 --> 02:56:31.091
<v Speaker 1>counterattack anything that's left that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it all the way through these </v>

3037
02:56:31.091 --> 02:56:34.580
<v Speaker 1>defenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is absolutely almost impenetrable and</v>

3038
02:56:34.581 --> 02:56:36.230
<v Speaker 1>devious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you only have two and a half,</v>

3039
02:56:36.231 --> 02:56:41.231
<v Speaker 1>two point $8 million men to fight four </v>
<v Speaker 1>or four and a half million men on the </v>

3040
02:56:41.231 --> 02:56:43.700
<v Speaker 1>other side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a good way to equalize the odds.</v>

3041
02:56:43.880 --> 02:56:48.880
<v Speaker 1>This is a weightlifter who's figured out</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way to lift more than a bigger </v>

3042
02:56:48.880 --> 02:56:48.950
<v Speaker 1>opponent.</v>

3043
02:56:49.910 --> 02:56:54.910
<v Speaker 1>My favorite part of the Hindenburg line </v>
<v Speaker 1>defenses as a military history fan is </v>

3044
02:56:54.910 --> 02:56:58.910
<v Speaker 1>that they build a giant moat in front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3045
02:56:58.911 --> 02:57:00.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no other way to phrase it.</v>

3046
02:57:00.661 --> 02:57:05.661
<v Speaker 1>It's an absolutely perpendicular wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>trench that is between nine and 10 feet </v>

3047
02:57:06.650 --> 02:57:11.650
<v Speaker 1>deep and 12 feet across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's meant to stop everything tanks </v>

3048
02:57:11.991 --> 02:57:16.991
<v Speaker 1>especially mean fall into there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't be able to climb up the </v>

3049
02:57:16.991 --> 02:57:19.841
<v Speaker 1>perpendicular side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not an easy job for troops </v>

3050
02:57:19.841 --> 02:57:23.030
<v Speaker 1>either and behind this giant moat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you might imagine,</v>

3051
02:57:23.031 --> 02:57:28.031
<v Speaker 1>our machine gun positions and all kinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of defenses and more wire and all these </v>

3052
02:57:28.031 --> 02:57:31.841
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is crazy to think about having to </v>

3053
02:57:31.841 --> 02:57:35.021
<v Speaker 1>attack something like that and what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more when Luton Dorf has people retreat </v>

3054
02:57:36.140 --> 02:57:40.910
<v Speaker 1>sort of toward the Hindenburg line and </v>
<v Speaker 1>give up these positions that hundreds of</v>

3055
02:57:40.910 --> 02:57:44.420
<v Speaker 1>thousands of Germans had died contesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the last couple of years.</v>

3056
02:57:44.780 --> 02:57:49.250
<v Speaker 1>He has soldiers destroy everything you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know as they go,</v>

3057
02:57:49.700 --> 02:57:52.940
<v Speaker 1>creating a dead zone from the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>frontline to the new one,</v>

3058
02:57:53.420 --> 02:57:58.420
<v Speaker 1>a scorched earth policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something which by the way upset crown </v>

3059
02:57:58.420 --> 02:58:01.080
<v Speaker 1>prince rubric to was the Field Marshal </v>
<v Speaker 1>commanding some of the troops who had to</v>

3060
02:58:01.081 --> 02:58:01.980
<v Speaker 1>do this destruction.</v>

3061
02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:07.280
<v Speaker 3>He was so upset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He almost resigned over it and </v>

3062
02:58:07.280 --> 02:58:07.280
<v Speaker 3>complained about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3063
02:58:07.280 --> 02:58:07.650
<v Speaker 3>how this would hurt Germany's </v>
<v Speaker 3>reputation.</v>

3064
02:58:07.651 --> 02:58:12.651
<v Speaker 3>And in that discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you basically see a 19th century of </v>

3065
02:58:12.651 --> 02:58:16.671
<v Speaker 3>figure with 19th century standards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crown prince rubric to member of the </v>

3066
02:58:16.671 --> 02:58:20.091
<v Speaker 3>Bavarian royalty and Luton Dorf a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thoroughly 20th century,</v>

3067
02:58:20.221 --> 02:58:23.280
<v Speaker 3>total war kind of guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a clash of cultures.</v>

3068
02:58:23.580 --> 02:58:28.470
<v Speaker 3>The 20th century one Ludendorff got his </v>
<v Speaker 3>way and the troops of the German army in</v>

3069
02:58:28.471 --> 02:58:33.471
<v Speaker 3>a very old school style began creating a</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead zone in this part of France in </v>

3070
02:58:35.281 --> 02:58:38.670
<v Speaker 3>front of the Hindenburg line and a dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>zone that extended in some places.</v>

3071
02:58:38.671 --> 02:58:42.470
<v Speaker 3>Twenty miles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>German soldier Ernst,</v>

3072
02:58:42.471 --> 02:58:46.440
<v Speaker 3>young or was there watching the </v>
<v Speaker 3>destruction take place.</v>

3073
02:58:47.130 --> 02:58:50.340
<v Speaker 3>And he compares it to a kind of lunacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3074
02:58:50.370 --> 02:58:55.370
<v Speaker 3>it's funny because if you think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>people doing this in the Second World </v>

3075
02:58:55.370 --> 02:58:58.310
<v Speaker 3>War,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think about them using mostly </v>

3076
02:58:58.310 --> 02:58:58.350
<v Speaker 3>explosives and they were explosives used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to create this dead zone,</v>

3077
02:58:58.351 --> 02:59:00.150
<v Speaker 3>but Germany needed her explosives.</v>

3078
02:59:00.300 --> 02:59:05.300
<v Speaker 3>And so a lot of this stuff was done by </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand and younger says it had a bad </v>

3079
02:59:05.761 --> 02:59:08.970
<v Speaker 3>effect on the troops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he also blamed some of it on what he</v>

3080
02:59:08.971 --> 02:59:13.050
<v Speaker 3>calls the economic times we live in or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

3081
02:59:13.051 --> 02:59:17.970
<v Speaker 3>And what he really means by that is this</v>
<v Speaker 3>total war 20th century sort of mentality</v>

3082
02:59:18.330 --> 02:59:22.860
<v Speaker 3>younger writes about passing through </v>
<v Speaker 3>this dead zone that was being created by</v>

3083
02:59:22.861 --> 02:59:27.861
<v Speaker 3>the German army.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As it moved backwards towards its main </v>

3084
02:59:27.861 --> 02:59:31.161
<v Speaker 3>line quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the villages we pass through on our way </v>

3085
02:59:31.161 --> 02:59:34.730
<v Speaker 3>had the look of vast lunatic asylums.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whole companies were set to knocking or </v>

3086
02:59:34.730 --> 02:59:37.110
<v Speaker 3>pulling down walls or sitting on </v>
<v Speaker 3>rooftops,</v>

3087
02:59:37.111 --> 02:59:39.750
<v Speaker 3>uprooting the tiles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trees were cut down,</v>

3088
02:59:39.900 --> 02:59:44.900
<v Speaker 3>windows smashed wherever you looked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Clouds of smoke and dust rose from vast </v>

3089
02:59:44.900 --> 02:59:49.551
<v Speaker 3>piles of debris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We saw men dashing about wearing suits </v>

3090
02:59:49.551 --> 02:59:52.650
<v Speaker 3>and dresses left behind by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inhabitants with top hats on their heads</v>

3091
02:59:52.920 --> 02:59:54.360
<v Speaker 3>with destructive cunning.</v>

3092
02:59:54.510 --> 02:59:58.080
<v Speaker 3>They found the roof trees of the houses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fixed ropes to them,</v>

3093
02:59:58.230 --> 03:00:02.310
<v Speaker 3>and then with concerted shouts polled </v>
<v Speaker 3>until they all came tumbling down,</v>

3094
03:00:02.550 --> 03:00:07.550
<v Speaker 3>others were swinging pile driving </v>
<v Speaker 3>hammers and wind around smashing </v>

3095
03:00:07.550 --> 03:00:11.721
<v Speaker 3>everything that got in their way from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the flower pots on the window sills to </v>

3096
03:00:11.721 --> 03:00:14.490
<v Speaker 3>whole ornate conservatories as far back </v>
<v Speaker 3>as the siegfried line.</v>

3097
03:00:14.670 --> 03:00:16.770
<v Speaker 3>That's what the Germans called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hindenburg line.</v>

3098
03:00:17.160 --> 03:00:21.030
<v Speaker 3>Every village was reduced to rubble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every tree chopped down.</v>

3099
03:00:21.120 --> 03:00:24.120
<v Speaker 3>Every road undermined every well </v>
<v Speaker 3>poisoned.</v>

3100
03:00:24.121 --> 03:00:26.400
<v Speaker 3>Every basement blown up or booby </v>
<v Speaker 3>trapped,</v>

3101
03:00:26.520 --> 03:00:30.060
<v Speaker 3>every rail unscrewed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every telephone wire rolled up.</v>

3102
03:00:30.270 --> 03:00:35.270
<v Speaker 3>Everything burnable burned in a word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were turning the country that are </v>

3103
03:00:35.270 --> 03:00:37.560
<v Speaker 3>advancing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Opponents would occupy into a wasteland.</v>

3104
03:00:37.740 --> 03:00:39.030
<v Speaker 3>As I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he writes,</v>

3105
03:00:39.150 --> 03:00:44.150
<v Speaker 3>the scenes were reminiscent of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>madhouse and the effect on the men was </v>

3106
03:00:44.150 --> 03:00:45.810
<v Speaker 3>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Half funny half repellent.</v>

3107
03:00:46.080 --> 03:00:47.970
<v Speaker 3>They were also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could see right away,</v>

3108
03:00:48.150 --> 03:00:53.150
<v Speaker 3>bad for the men's morale and honor here </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the first time I witnessed wanton </v>

3109
03:00:53.150 --> 03:00:54.510
<v Speaker 3>destruction that I was later in life to </v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

3110
03:00:54.511 --> 03:00:55.320
<v Speaker 3>to access.</v>

3111
03:00:55.590 --> 03:01:00.590
<v Speaker 3>This is something that has unhealthfully</v>
<v Speaker 3>bound up with the economic thinking of </v>

3112
03:01:00.590 --> 03:01:04.081
<v Speaker 3>our age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it does more harm than good to the </v>

3113
03:01:04.081 --> 03:01:05.200
<v Speaker 3>destroyer and dishonors the soldier and </v>
<v Speaker 3>quote,</v>

3114
03:01:06.580 --> 03:01:10.510
<v Speaker 3>and it should be remembered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The decision to award damaged country.</v>

3115
03:01:10.511 --> 03:01:15.511
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this area that they are pulling apart </v>

3116
03:01:15.511 --> 03:01:17.461
<v Speaker 3>now in creating a dead zone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was an idyllic part of France that </v>

3117
03:01:17.461 --> 03:01:18.100
<v Speaker 3>wasn't touched by the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you weren't right on the front in the</v>

3118
03:01:18.101 --> 03:01:20.140
<v Speaker 3>first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in the western front,</v>

3119
03:01:20.350 --> 03:01:23.830
<v Speaker 3>things were great behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the complaints French soldiers on</v>

3120
03:01:23.831 --> 03:01:28.831
<v Speaker 3>leave have is you can get 20 or 30 miles</v>
<v Speaker 3>behind the front line and everything is </v>

3121
03:01:28.831 --> 03:01:30.960
<v Speaker 3>like there's not even a war going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3122
03:01:30.970 --> 03:01:34.420
<v Speaker 3>they see men with their sweethearts </v>
<v Speaker 3>prowling around going to restaurants for</v>

3123
03:01:34.421 --> 03:01:36.820
<v Speaker 3>dinner in a town 30 miles from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>front,</v>

3124
03:01:36.821 --> 03:01:41.821
<v Speaker 3>and it's like it's another world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're tearing down these beautiful </v>

3125
03:01:41.821 --> 03:01:44.260
<v Speaker 3>parts of France to create this dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>zone.</v>

3126
03:01:44.260 --> 03:01:49.260
<v Speaker 3>They're destroying everything and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're leaving booby traps behind </v>

3127
03:01:49.931 --> 03:01:52.060
<v Speaker 3>because when the Germans give up their </v>
<v Speaker 3>positions,</v>

3128
03:01:52.300 --> 03:01:53.740
<v Speaker 3>they're going to retreat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I said,</v>

3129
03:01:53.741 --> 03:01:57.700
<v Speaker 3>sometimes 20 miles in this one area all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way back to the main line.</v>

3130
03:01:58.150 --> 03:02:01.930
<v Speaker 3>The allies are going to follow them when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they follow them,</v>

3131
03:02:01.931 --> 03:02:04.690
<v Speaker 3>they're going to run into these towns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they run into these towns,</v>

3132
03:02:04.840 --> 03:02:07.630
<v Speaker 3>they're going to run into and younger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talked about it earlier,</v>

3133
03:02:07.631 --> 03:02:09.010
<v Speaker 3>booby traps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what he said,</v>

3134
03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:14.040
<v Speaker 3>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>among the surprises we prepared for our </v>

3135
03:02:14.040 --> 03:02:15.130
<v Speaker 3>successors were some truly malicious </v>
<v Speaker 3>inventions,</v>

3136
03:02:15.400 --> 03:02:17.800
<v Speaker 3>very fine wires,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost invisible.</v>

3137
03:02:17.890 --> 03:02:20.890
<v Speaker 3>We're stretched across the entrance of </v>
<v Speaker 3>buildings and shelters,</v>

3138
03:02:21.130 --> 03:02:25.540
<v Speaker 3>which set off explosive charges at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>faintest touch in some places.</v>

3139
03:02:25.690 --> 03:02:29.650
<v Speaker 3>Narrow ditches were dug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a crossroads and shells hidden in them.</v>

3140
03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:33.610
<v Speaker 3>They were then covered over by a large </v>
<v Speaker 3>plank and had earth strewn over them,</v>

3141
03:02:33.790 --> 03:02:37.750
<v Speaker 3>and nail had been driven into the plank </v>
<v Speaker 3>only just above the shelf use.</v>

3142
03:02:37.960 --> 03:02:41.830
<v Speaker 3>The space was measured so that marching </v>
<v Speaker 3>troops could pass over the spot safely,</v>

3143
03:02:41.980 --> 03:02:44.830
<v Speaker 3>but the moment the first truck or field </v>
<v Speaker 3>gun rumbled up,</v>

3144
03:02:45.010 --> 03:02:50.010
<v Speaker 3>the board would give and the nail would </v>
<v Speaker 3>touch off the shell or there were </v>

3145
03:02:50.010 --> 03:02:52.750
<v Speaker 3>spiteful time bombs that were buried in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the basements of undamaged buildings.</v>

3146
03:02:52.960 --> 03:02:56.890
<v Speaker 3>They consisted of two sections with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>metal partition going down the middle in</v>

3147
03:02:56.891 --> 03:02:59.440
<v Speaker 3>one part was explosive in the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>acid.</v>

3148
03:02:59.680 --> 03:03:01.780
<v Speaker 3>After these devils eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he calls them,</v>

3149
03:03:01.781 --> 03:03:06.781
<v Speaker 3>had been primed and hidden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The acids slowly over weeks eroded the </v>

3150
03:03:06.781 --> 03:03:08.440
<v Speaker 3>metal partition and then set off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bomb.</v>

3151
03:03:09.010 --> 03:03:14.010
<v Speaker 3>In quote British reporter Philip Gibbs </v>
<v Speaker 3>went through some of these towns right </v>

3152
03:03:14.010 --> 03:03:15.610
<v Speaker 3>after younger and his men had vacated </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

3153
03:03:15.700 --> 03:03:20.700
<v Speaker 3>and allied forces had moved in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Gibb's talks about all those same kinds </v>

3154
03:03:20.700 --> 03:03:24.901
<v Speaker 3>of booby traps and then says this quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only a few of our men were killed or </v>

3155
03:03:25.421 --> 03:03:30.421
<v Speaker 3>blinded by these monkey tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are Engineers found most of them before </v>

3156
03:03:30.421 --> 03:03:34.171
<v Speaker 3>they were touched off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one went down dugouts or into ruin </v>

3157
03:03:34.171 --> 03:03:37.060
<v Speaker 3>houses with a sense of imminent danger </v>
<v Speaker 3>all through the devastated region.</v>

3158
03:03:37.210 --> 03:03:42.070
<v Speaker 3>One walked with an uncanny feeling of an</v>
<v Speaker 3>evil spirit left behind by the masses of</v>

3159
03:03:42.071 --> 03:03:46.510
<v Speaker 3>men whose bodies had gone away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It exuded from scraps of old clothing.</v>

3160
03:03:46.720 --> 03:03:50.170
<v Speaker 3>It was in the stench of the dugouts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the ruins that they had made,</v>

3161
03:03:50.530 --> 03:03:55.330
<v Speaker 3>and to quote a booby trap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead zone,</v>

3162
03:03:56.140 --> 03:03:58.170
<v Speaker 3>Lewd endorphins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fully 20th</v>

3163
03:03:58.170 --> 03:04:00.720
<v Speaker 1>century total war commander,</v>

3164
03:04:03.600 --> 03:04:08.600
<v Speaker 1>and this is a big move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is pulling a big rabbit out of a </v>

3165
03:04:08.600 --> 03:04:08.600
<v Speaker 1>hat and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3166
03:04:08.600 --> 03:04:09.750
<v Speaker 1>if you're a military history fan like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>am,</v>

3167
03:04:09.960 --> 03:04:12.150
<v Speaker 1>it's what makes alluded door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So interesting.</v>

3168
03:04:12.300 --> 03:04:17.300
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot of generals would pull this </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of stunt and it was a game changer </v>

3169
03:04:17.300 --> 03:04:19.410
<v Speaker 1>in many respects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that whole dead zone for example,</v>

3170
03:04:19.890 --> 03:04:24.360
<v Speaker 1>proved to be a huge problem for British </v>
<v Speaker 1>and French forces to try to overcome.</v>

3171
03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:29.600
<v Speaker 1>They move into this cratered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed denuded area where even the </v>

3172
03:04:29.971 --> 03:04:32.940
<v Speaker 1>wells have been poisoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you even supply that?</v>

3173
03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:38.840
<v Speaker 1>The Germans on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've moved to sites they'd been </v>

3174
03:04:38.840 --> 03:04:41.061
<v Speaker 1>working on for months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some parts of the Hindenburg line have </v>

3175
03:04:41.061 --> 03:04:44.571
<v Speaker 1>had half a million workers working on it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for months and months and months and </v>

3176
03:04:44.571 --> 03:04:46.650
<v Speaker 1>building a new front line from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like building a new home.</v>

3177
03:04:46.800 --> 03:04:48.240
<v Speaker 1>It was now moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ready.</v>

3178
03:04:48.330 --> 03:04:53.330
<v Speaker 1>They moved back into it and there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>railroads bringing supplies up to the </v>

3179
03:04:53.330 --> 03:04:56.610
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What Luton Dorf did was wrong foot.</v>

3180
03:04:57.000 --> 03:04:59.100
<v Speaker 1>The allies he stolen night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>March.</v>

3181
03:04:59.101 --> 03:05:04.101
<v Speaker 1>He sees the initiative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He changed their plans for 1917 without </v>

3182
03:05:04.681 --> 03:05:07.680
<v Speaker 1>knowing what their plans were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He simply figured,</v>

3183
03:05:07.681 --> 03:05:12.681
<v Speaker 1>if I do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the planning they've been doing for </v>

3184
03:05:12.681 --> 03:05:15.021
<v Speaker 1>months will be obsolete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're planning to have me 20 miles </v>

3185
03:05:16.050 --> 03:05:18.000
<v Speaker 1>closer to Paris than I am.</v>

3186
03:05:20.180 --> 03:05:23.000
<v Speaker 1>If you were an ally general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you deal with this problem?</v>

3187
03:05:24.110 --> 03:05:26.180
<v Speaker 1>And if you said you don't want to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this problem,</v>

3188
03:05:26.181 --> 03:05:28.040
<v Speaker 1>that this looks like an impenetrable </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmare,</v>

3189
03:05:28.250 --> 03:05:33.250
<v Speaker 1>that just puts you in league with those </v>
<v Speaker 1>military thinkers at the time who were </v>

3190
03:05:33.250 --> 03:05:37.871
<v Speaker 1>known as easterners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people who thought attacking on </v>

3191
03:05:37.871 --> 03:05:40.610
<v Speaker 1>the western front was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the defenses.</v>

3192
03:05:40.611 --> 03:05:43.970
<v Speaker 1>Who would do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The prime minister of Britain,</v>

3193
03:05:43.971 --> 03:05:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Lloyd George is one of these guys.</v>

3194
03:05:46.980 --> 03:05:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can always find generals and </v>

3195
03:05:51.980 --> 03:05:56.181
<v Speaker 1>military commanders who no matter how </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible the military task looks,</v>

3196
03:05:57.870 --> 03:06:02.870
<v Speaker 1>will be optimistic about explaining to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you how their plan will overcome it </v>

3197
03:06:03.240 --> 03:06:08.240
<v Speaker 1>after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't get those jobs by </v>

3198
03:06:08.240 --> 03:06:09.690
<v Speaker 1>explaining how they can't overcome the </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy's defenses.</v>

3199
03:06:10.680 --> 03:06:12.900
<v Speaker 1>We told you earlier that the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>sack,</v>

3200
03:06:13.200 --> 03:06:16.080
<v Speaker 1>their military leader that they've had </v>
<v Speaker 1>since the beginning of the wars you also</v>

3201
03:06:16.081 --> 03:06:17.730
<v Speaker 1>shot for and they sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3202
03:06:17.731 --> 03:06:22.731
<v Speaker 1>kick him upstairs and before they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have another one of those yearly </v>

3203
03:06:22.731 --> 03:06:26.511
<v Speaker 1>meetings where all the allies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians and the British and the </v>

3204
03:06:26.511 --> 03:06:29.331
<v Speaker 1>French and all the other allies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get together and they had this </v>

3205
03:06:29.331 --> 03:06:29.331
<v Speaker 1>meeting and they try to coordinate next </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

3206
03:06:29.331 --> 03:06:32.991
<v Speaker 1>military plans so that when the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the French attack on the western </v>

3207
03:06:32.991 --> 03:06:37.311
<v Speaker 1>front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians at the same time attack on </v>

3208
03:06:37.311 --> 03:06:38.991
<v Speaker 1>the east and the Italians attack in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>south and everybody's pushing in </v>

3209
03:06:38.991 --> 03:06:39.450
<v Speaker 1>multiple directions all at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forcing the Germans to,</v>

3210
03:06:39.870 --> 03:06:42.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe break somewhere.</v>

3211
03:06:42.091 --> 03:06:47.091
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the central powers at this point are </v>

3212
03:06:47.091 --> 03:06:48.660
<v Speaker 1>like an egg and as soon as you can break</v>
<v Speaker 1>into any one of their sides,</v>

3213
03:06:48.661 --> 03:06:49.290
<v Speaker 1>east,</v>
<v Speaker 1>west,</v>

3214
03:06:49.291 --> 03:06:49.950
<v Speaker 1>north,</v>
<v Speaker 1>south,</v>

3215
03:06:49.951 --> 03:06:52.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean you feel like the war would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>

3216
03:06:52.290 --> 03:06:57.290
<v Speaker 1>but they're all holding steady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most commanders are looking the </v>

3217
03:06:57.290 --> 03:06:57.900
<v Speaker 1>western front and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nothing's as steady as that.</v>

3218
03:07:00.180 --> 03:07:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Must we attack it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will the French had always believed,</v>

3219
03:07:03.421 --> 03:07:04.080
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must.</v>

3220
03:07:04.100 --> 03:07:09.100
<v Speaker 1>And of course they were a little biased </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Germans are on their soil </v>

3221
03:07:09.100 --> 03:07:11.871
<v Speaker 1>and they would like to see them pushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>off when Joseph Jaffra is asked in late </v>

3222
03:07:11.971 --> 03:07:15.180
<v Speaker 1>1916 at the big meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to do in 1917?</v>

3223
03:07:15.181 --> 03:07:20.181
<v Speaker 1>What's the plan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer tells them his plan is a </v>

3224
03:07:20.181 --> 03:07:21.120
<v Speaker 1>repetition of the somme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The battle that was just wrapping up the</v>

3225
03:07:21.121 --> 03:07:24.660
<v Speaker 1>battle that was so horrible for British </v>
<v Speaker 1>and even for French forces,</v>

3226
03:07:26.190 --> 03:07:27.990
<v Speaker 1>gonna where the Germans down in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3227
03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:28.320
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3228
03:07:28.321 --> 03:07:33.321
<v Speaker 1>several months long battle that forces </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to throw in the last of their </v>

3229
03:07:33.321 --> 03:07:36.470
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>French politicians were horrified by </v>

3230
03:07:36.470 --> 03:07:39.201
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last thing they wanted is a battle </v>

3231
03:07:39.201 --> 03:07:39.201
<v Speaker 1>like that because as far as they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

3232
03:07:39.240 --> 03:07:41.700
<v Speaker 1>how did anybody know that it wouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French nation,</v>

3233
03:07:41.940 --> 03:07:44.070
<v Speaker 1>the through in all their resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and man,</v>

3234
03:07:46.370 --> 03:07:48.950
<v Speaker 1>this is part of the reason is you offer </v>
<v Speaker 1>got kicked upstairs.</v>

3235
03:07:49.520 --> 03:07:53.260
<v Speaker 1>The French politicians had had enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like British politicians.</v>

3236
03:07:53.530 --> 03:07:58.180
<v Speaker 1>They were starting to do the unthinkable</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of 19th century attitudes.</v>

3237
03:07:58.630 --> 03:08:03.630
<v Speaker 1>They were starting to interfere with </v>
<v Speaker 1>military decisions because they were </v>

3238
03:08:03.630 --> 03:08:07.141
<v Speaker 1>losing faith that the people making the </v>
<v Speaker 1>military decisions had the right </v>

3239
03:08:07.141 --> 03:08:09.760
<v Speaker 1>priorities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The politicians were</v>

3240
03:08:10.510 --> 03:08:14.680
<v Speaker 1>worried about the casualty totals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the big criticisms,</v>

3241
03:08:14.681 --> 03:08:16.570
<v Speaker 1>especially from the soldiers in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>field,</v>

3242
03:08:17.050 --> 03:08:22.050
<v Speaker 1>is that the generals weren't the guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets the job as the main allied military</v>

3243
03:08:22.491 --> 03:08:27.491
<v Speaker 1>commander in 1917 we mentioned earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a guy named Robert and evil and evil </v>

3244
03:08:27.491 --> 03:08:31.930
<v Speaker 1>gets this job because he's the guy out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there optimistic about victory.</v>

3245
03:08:32.420 --> 03:08:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generals do not get hired,</v>

3246
03:08:35.210 --> 03:08:38.120
<v Speaker 1>promising to not overcome the enemy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>defenses,</v>

3247
03:08:38.210 --> 03:08:41.390
<v Speaker 1>so there's an ingrown bias in the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

3248
03:08:42.090 --> 03:08:47.090
<v Speaker 1>but Robert and Israel tells the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership when he takes over that you </v>

3249
03:08:47.461 --> 03:08:49.230
<v Speaker 1>don't have to have another battle of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>somme.</v>

3250
03:08:49.231 --> 03:08:51.030
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to have a grinding </v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

3251
03:08:51.031 --> 03:08:54.450
<v Speaker 1>long battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have a lightning bolt,</v>

3252
03:08:54.780 --> 03:08:59.780
<v Speaker 1>sort of hammer stroke that just ends the</v>
<v Speaker 1>war in 48 hours.</v>

3253
03:09:01.970 --> 03:09:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Now it sounds crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

3254
03:09:03.280 --> 03:09:08.280
<v Speaker 1>There were a bunch of French general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of whom Nouvelle leapfrogged over.</v>

3255
03:09:08.770 --> 03:09:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were guys who probably deserved the</v>

3256
03:09:10.731 --> 03:09:13.880
<v Speaker 1>job at least three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe four more than Nevada,</v>

3257
03:09:13.881 --> 03:09:17.180
<v Speaker 1>but Nevada was this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a charmer.</v>

3258
03:09:17.210 --> 03:09:17.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3259
03:09:17.571 --> 03:09:20.210
<v Speaker 1>he's one of these people that can win </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone over.</v>

3260
03:09:20.570 --> 03:09:22.850
<v Speaker 1>He's not winning over these jealous </v>
<v Speaker 1>generals.</v>

3261
03:09:22.851 --> 03:09:27.851
<v Speaker 1>He leapfrogged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of politicians that </v>

3262
03:09:27.851 --> 03:09:30.341
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are sold with Nivo and some of them </v>

3263
03:09:30.341 --> 03:09:33.401
<v Speaker 1>aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even French novel has this great </v>

3264
03:09:33.401 --> 03:09:33.401
<v Speaker 1>advantage over the other French,</v>

3265
03:09:33.401 --> 03:09:34.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>military leaders,</v>

3266
03:09:34.980 --> 03:09:37.830
<v Speaker 1>he speaks English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he speaks it perfectly.</v>

3267
03:09:37.831 --> 03:09:40.290
<v Speaker 1>He speaks it without an accent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His mother's English.</v>

3268
03:09:41.670 --> 03:09:44.640
<v Speaker 1>So he's a charmer to begin with kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a salesman.</v>

3269
03:09:44.670 --> 03:09:47.400
<v Speaker 1>But people like him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't feel slimy or sleazy.</v>

3270
03:09:47.760 --> 03:09:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sort of an optimist and he goes over </v>

3271
03:09:52.760 --> 03:09:55.401
<v Speaker 1>to Britain and he wins over even the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arch easterner Lloyd George</v>

3272
03:09:57.600 --> 03:10:00.810
<v Speaker 1>that was in there and explains to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British exactly how this plan to rupture</v>

3273
03:10:00.811 --> 03:10:05.460
<v Speaker 1>the enemy lines will work and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>involves creating a reserve of 27,</v>

3274
03:10:05.461 --> 03:10:09.690
<v Speaker 1>28 divisions that are going to be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spider in the web and as soon as the</v>

3275
03:10:09.691 --> 03:10:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Germans are held in certain places and </v>
<v Speaker 1>weakened and then this 27 divisions will</v>

3276
03:10:13.591 --> 03:10:16.260
<v Speaker 1>go get them and it's going to take 48 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

3277
03:10:17.520 --> 03:10:21.270
<v Speaker 1>And like any good salesman offering sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a money back guarantee,</v>

3278
03:10:21.660 --> 03:10:26.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a guarantee in this deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the guarantee that naval tells </v>

3279
03:10:26.660 --> 03:10:27.510
<v Speaker 1>everybody is if it doesn't work in 48 </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

3280
03:10:27.511 --> 03:10:32.511
<v Speaker 1>we'll call it off after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a promise to get rid of the </v>

3281
03:10:32.551 --> 03:10:37.551
<v Speaker 1>part of these battles that's most </v>
<v Speaker 1>troubling to people who care about dead </v>

3282
03:10:37.551 --> 03:10:38.160
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the dead people,</v>

3283
03:10:39.280 --> 03:10:44.280
<v Speaker 1>unless you have just tragic first day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the battle of the Somme and </v>

3284
03:10:44.280 --> 03:10:45.970
<v Speaker 1>the battle of the frontiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the deaths happen because these</v>

3285
03:10:45.971 --> 03:10:48.610
<v Speaker 1>battles go on for months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could end them after 48 hours,</v>

3286
03:10:48.611 --> 03:10:50.710
<v Speaker 1>if you had a chance to see is it working</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not working,</v>

3287
03:10:50.711 --> 03:10:51.790
<v Speaker 1>call it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not working.</v>

3288
03:10:52.090 --> 03:10:57.090
<v Speaker 1>That takes a lot of the risk out of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can see why politicians would </v>

3289
03:10:57.090 --> 03:10:59.971
<v Speaker 1>like that plan a lot more than just </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying let's have another four or five </v>

3290
03:10:59.971 --> 03:11:00.910
<v Speaker 1>months long battle.</v>

3291
03:11:03.540 --> 03:11:05.530
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in hindsight,</v>

3292
03:11:05.540 --> 03:11:10.540
<v Speaker 1>as everyone knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nouvelle was working on a on an idea </v>

3293
03:11:10.540 --> 03:11:10.950
<v Speaker 1>that might not have been tenable.</v>

3294
03:11:12.860 --> 03:11:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Novell made his name at the battle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Verdun at the very last stages of it.</v>

3295
03:11:16.251 --> 03:11:18.500
<v Speaker 1>When the Germans were being pushed back </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the other direction.</v>

3296
03:11:18.980 --> 03:11:23.980
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of historical debate over </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not anything novel did was </v>

3297
03:11:23.980 --> 03:11:25.580
<v Speaker 1>effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even if it was effective,</v>

3298
03:11:25.581 --> 03:11:28.730
<v Speaker 1>it was effective at a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very low level to all of a sudden be the</v>

3299
03:11:28.731 --> 03:11:31.820
<v Speaker 1>military leader in charge of not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of Francis forces,</v>

3300
03:11:32.300 --> 03:11:37.300
<v Speaker 1>but kind of Britain's forces to who he </v>
<v Speaker 1>will clash and avail will clash with </v>

3301
03:11:37.300 --> 03:11:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Britain's commander Douglas Haig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do not like each other.</v>

3302
03:11:38.661 --> 03:11:41.420
<v Speaker 1>The Egos of generals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our proverbial anyway,</v>

3303
03:11:41.600 --> 03:11:44.540
<v Speaker 1>and these two guys will fight in them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will create problems between Britain and</v>

3304
03:11:44.541 --> 03:11:46.190
<v Speaker 1>France as allies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

3305
03:11:46.191 --> 03:11:51.191
<v Speaker 1>novellas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most powerful military commander on </v>

3306
03:11:51.191 --> 03:11:51.440
<v Speaker 1>the western front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's never commanded forces like this.</v>

3307
03:11:52.670 --> 03:11:57.530
<v Speaker 1>His first real problem happens when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans pull this,</v>

3308
03:11:57.680 --> 03:12:02.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>operation Albert and disappear and it </v>

3309
03:12:02.761 --> 03:12:07.761
<v Speaker 1>reminds me a little of the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting away at Gullapalli and fooling </v>

3310
03:12:07.761 --> 03:12:08.640
<v Speaker 1>the Turks so that the Turks didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they'd left.</v>

3311
03:12:09.570 --> 03:12:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Now the Germans just kind of pull back </v>
<v Speaker 1>from this giant salient and wait for the</v>

3312
03:12:13.411 --> 03:12:14.940
<v Speaker 1>British to find out they're gone.</v>

3313
03:12:16.910 --> 03:12:18.850
<v Speaker 1>And I love the way it starts by the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts with,</v>

3314
03:12:19.030 --> 03:12:24.030
<v Speaker 1>with the British looking out over their </v>
<v Speaker 1>trenches and seeing the German trenches </v>

3315
03:12:24.030 --> 03:12:27.910
<v Speaker 1>being shelled and then coming to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>realization that the German trenches </v>

3316
03:12:27.910 --> 03:12:32.050
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're facing off against her </v>

3317
03:12:32.050 --> 03:12:34.151
<v Speaker 1>being shelled by Germans and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>German artillery blowing up the trenches</v>

3318
03:12:34.161 --> 03:12:39.161
<v Speaker 1>and destroying everything of value in it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then destroying the trenches so the </v>

3319
03:12:39.161 --> 03:12:39.350
<v Speaker 1>British can't move up into them and use </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3320
03:12:40.790 --> 03:12:43.520
<v Speaker 1>And then of course the probing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must have been Erie.</v>

3321
03:12:43.760 --> 03:12:48.760
<v Speaker 1>There were like single Germans left </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind to shoot a rifle off every now </v>

3322
03:12:48.760 --> 03:12:50.300
<v Speaker 1>and then and just keep the allied armies</v>
<v Speaker 1>from pursuing too closely,</v>

3323
03:12:50.840 --> 03:12:53.930
<v Speaker 1>but it was clear that the Germans were </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling back,</v>

3324
03:12:53.960 --> 03:12:55.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles and miles,</v>

3325
03:12:55.011 --> 03:13:00.011
<v Speaker 1>churchill had said like 50 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every place I read said more like 20 at </v>

3326
03:13:00.011 --> 03:13:03.281
<v Speaker 1>the farthest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless to pull back that far </v>

3327
03:13:03.281 --> 03:13:03.620
<v Speaker 1>means your military maps are all </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

3328
03:13:03.980 --> 03:13:08.980
<v Speaker 1>The place that the hammer blow in </v>
<v Speaker 1>nibbles offensive was going to fall is </v>

3329
03:13:08.980 --> 03:13:11.360
<v Speaker 1>the place Luton Dorf just vacated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3330
03:13:11.361 --> 03:13:14.840
<v Speaker 1>so as Ludina are probably intended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to change your plans,</v>

3331
03:13:14.841 --> 03:13:18.650
<v Speaker 1>don't you mean conditions on the ground?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That changed and evolved said,</v>

3332
03:13:18.651 --> 03:13:23.651
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to change my plans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This all helps my goal and this is where</v>

3333
03:13:23.991 --> 03:13:26.240
<v Speaker 1>everything starts to fall apart in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan,</v>

3334
03:13:26.450 --> 03:13:31.450
<v Speaker 1>and yet at the same time you can see how</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are such huge affairs involving so</v>

3335
03:13:32.631 --> 03:13:37.631
<v Speaker 1>many months of preparation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much momentum that even if you find </v>

3336
03:13:37.631 --> 03:13:41.240
<v Speaker 1>out near the beginning of the of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle that things have changed.</v>

3337
03:13:41.840 --> 03:13:44.150
<v Speaker 1>There's a momentum that you can't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>even stop.</v>

3338
03:13:44.151 --> 03:13:45.590
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything starts going wrong.</v>

3339
03:13:45.591 --> 03:13:47.510
<v Speaker 1>For interval before the whole battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts,</v>

3340
03:13:48.790 --> 03:13:53.790
<v Speaker 1>nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before knievel's part of the battle </v>

3341
03:13:53.790 --> 03:13:55.561
<v Speaker 1>starts the campaign that sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversionary campaign designed to make </v>

3342
03:13:56.891 --> 03:14:01.030
<v Speaker 1>the Germans move away from where the is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to attack starts.</v>

3343
03:14:01.060 --> 03:14:06.060
<v Speaker 1>That's the part of this campaign that </v>
<v Speaker 1>involves the British and the dominion </v>

3344
03:14:06.131 --> 03:14:07.570
<v Speaker 1>forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens,</v>

3345
03:14:07.890 --> 03:14:12.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next to the French position at a place </v>

3346
03:14:12.890 --> 03:14:14.821
<v Speaker 1>called Rs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at this battle for at least a few </v>

3347
03:14:16.580 --> 03:14:21.580
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone gets a chance to see exactly </v>

3348
03:14:21.580 --> 03:14:25.451
<v Speaker 1>how you would go about striking defenses</v>
<v Speaker 1>as invincible as the Germans.</v>

3349
03:14:26.270 --> 03:14:29.600
<v Speaker 1>And it looks a lot like world war two.</v>

3350
03:14:31.940 --> 03:14:33.860
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several historians have pointed out that</v>

3351
03:14:33.861 --> 03:14:38.861
<v Speaker 1>by the end of the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the armies are prodo second world war </v>

3352
03:14:38.861 --> 03:14:42.581
<v Speaker 1>armies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are certain battles though during </v>

3353
03:14:42.581 --> 03:14:42.581
<v Speaker 1>the war where you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aha,</v>

3354
03:14:42.581 --> 03:14:47.240
<v Speaker 1>there is a big step forward towards that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second World War 20th century style of </v>

3355
03:14:48.621 --> 03:14:53.621
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the battle of Eros is known </v>

3356
03:14:53.621 --> 03:14:53.621
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3357
03:14:53.621 --> 03:14:54.050
<v Speaker 1>in the grand scheme of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said,</v>

3358
03:14:54.140 --> 03:14:57.170
<v Speaker 1>this is the spring offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what the allies do every year,</v>

3359
03:14:57.171 --> 03:15:02.171
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weather gets good and spring we </v>

3360
03:15:02.171 --> 03:15:04.091
<v Speaker 1>launched an offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British and the French launch one </v>

3361
03:15:04.091 --> 03:15:04.091
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they launched one in tandem.</v>

3362
03:15:04.091 --> 03:15:04.820
<v Speaker 1>The Italians do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said,</v>

3363
03:15:04.880 --> 03:15:06.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean they launch them everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Russians.</v>

3364
03:15:06.530 --> 03:15:11.530
<v Speaker 1>This is the big spring offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British part is these sort of </v>

3365
03:15:11.530 --> 03:15:14.801
<v Speaker 1>diversion as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet they're going to pull this off </v>

3366
03:15:14.801 --> 03:15:18.550
<v Speaker 1>initially so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to show everyone what 20th</v>

3367
03:15:19.071 --> 03:15:21.410
<v Speaker 1>century combined arms warfare looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3368
03:15:21.411 --> 03:15:26.411
<v Speaker 1>including aircraft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of coordination though that </v>

3369
03:15:26.411 --> 03:15:29.681
<v Speaker 1>has to come off correctly to make this </v>
<v Speaker 1>work is stunning and it can't be </v>

3370
03:15:29.681 --> 03:15:31.580
<v Speaker 1>maintained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the short period of time they're</v>

3371
03:15:31.581 --> 03:15:36.581
<v Speaker 1>able to make it work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British show you that modern </v>

3372
03:15:36.581 --> 03:15:40.250
<v Speaker 1>combined arms warfare can devastate </v>
<v Speaker 1>these static defenses.</v>

3373
03:15:42.110 --> 03:15:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Here's the way historian Peter Harte </v>
<v Speaker 1>describes the many things that were </v>

3374
03:15:47.110 --> 03:15:49.410
<v Speaker 1>starting to come together that could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>unleashed at Eros and how scientific and</v>

3375
03:15:49.411 --> 03:15:50.250
<v Speaker 1>modern 20th</v>

3376
03:15:50.250 --> 03:15:53.940
<v Speaker 3>century this profession of arms is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really becoming.</v>

3377
03:15:54.420 --> 03:15:55.230
<v Speaker 3>He writes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quote,</v>

3378
03:15:57.180 --> 03:15:59.250
<v Speaker 3>many lessons had been learned from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Psalm,</v>

3379
03:15:59.430 --> 03:16:03.440
<v Speaker 3>and artillery was at the heart of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>plans and the royal artillery had come a</v>

3380
03:16:03.441 --> 03:16:08.441
<v Speaker 3>long way since 1915.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thousands upon thousands of new </v>

3381
03:16:08.441 --> 03:16:10.770
<v Speaker 3>recruits had learned their trade well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That gun detachments,</v>

3382
03:16:10.860 --> 03:16:15.860
<v Speaker 3>the layers the NCO is the officers were </v>
<v Speaker 3>all now wedded into efficient batteries </v>

3383
03:16:15.860 --> 03:16:19.710
<v Speaker 3>that were capable of increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated and complex bombardments.</v>

3384
03:16:20.040 --> 03:16:25.040
<v Speaker 3>The guns themselves were now plentiful </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there were vast numbers of medium </v>

3385
03:16:25.040 --> 03:16:28.641
<v Speaker 3>and heavy artillery pieces joining the </v>
<v Speaker 3>masses of ordinary 18 pounder and four </v>

3386
03:16:28.641 --> 03:16:29.790
<v Speaker 3>and a half inch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how it's your field,</v>

3387
03:16:29.791 --> 03:16:34.791
<v Speaker 3>artillery advances in technology and </v>
<v Speaker 3>science also combined to give a greater </v>

3388
03:16:34.791 --> 03:16:39.441
<v Speaker 3>understanding of the mechanics of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>shell in flight and the measurable </v>

3389
03:16:39.441 --> 03:16:43.071
<v Speaker 3>adjustments caused by different media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A logical conditions accuracy was </v>

3390
03:16:43.071 --> 03:16:46.290
<v Speaker 3>improving and the advent of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] fuse meant that shells would</v>

3391
03:16:46.291 --> 03:16:49.020
<v Speaker 3>burst instantaneously on the slightest </v>
<v Speaker 3>contact,</v>

3392
03:16:49.200 --> 03:16:51.370
<v Speaker 3>which made clearing barbed wire and </v>
<v Speaker 3>great deal.</v>

3393
03:16:51.380 --> 03:16:55.980
<v Speaker 3>Simpler smoke shells were also now </v>
<v Speaker 3>routinely incorporated into the barrages</v>

3394
03:16:56.130 --> 03:16:59.250
<v Speaker 3>to try to mask the attacking infantry </v>
<v Speaker 3>from German defenders.</v>

3395
03:16:59.490 --> 03:17:04.490
<v Speaker 3>Gas shells were a key part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>barrages and they were less visually </v>

3396
03:17:04.490 --> 03:17:05.940
<v Speaker 3>dramatic than the clouds of gas released</v>
<v Speaker 3>from cylinders,</v>

3397
03:17:06.120 --> 03:17:09.900
<v Speaker 3>but they were far easier to deploy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>much more predictable in their effects.</v>

3398
03:17:10.200 --> 03:17:15.200
<v Speaker 3>Progress in the linked tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A photographic reconnaissance and </v>

3399
03:17:15.200 --> 03:17:18.891
<v Speaker 3>artillery observation allowed targets to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be identified and then destroyed by </v>

3400
03:17:18.891 --> 03:17:20.130
<v Speaker 3>indirect fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New techniques,</v>

3401
03:17:20.131 --> 03:17:25.080
<v Speaker 3>a flash spotting and sound ranging also </v>
<v Speaker 3>assisted in locating the exact positions</v>

3402
03:17:25.081 --> 03:17:30.081
<v Speaker 3>of German batteries and the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>coordination that has to come off </v>

3403
03:17:30.241 --> 03:17:35.241
<v Speaker 3>correctly to make this stuff work is </v>
<v Speaker 3>astounding and it shouldn't be </v>

3404
03:17:35.241 --> 03:17:38.721
<v Speaker 3>surprising that it usually doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes her us different is that in </v>

3405
03:17:38.721 --> 03:17:41.070
<v Speaker 3>some cases it did at the battle of Rs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take for example,</v>

3406
03:17:41.400 --> 03:17:46.400
<v Speaker 3>the creeping barrage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the creeping barrage is a fantastic </v>

3407
03:17:46.400 --> 03:17:50.750
<v Speaker 3>military innovation and they'd been </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to make it work before this </v>

3408
03:17:50.750 --> 03:17:51.180
<v Speaker 3>battle in this battle.</v>

3409
03:17:51.180 --> 03:17:56.180
<v Speaker 3>They got it right in this battle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were able for a while to create a </v>

3410
03:17:56.180 --> 03:18:00.240
<v Speaker 3>protective explosive force field around </v>
<v Speaker 3>British troops.</v>

3411
03:18:01.260 --> 03:18:04.890
<v Speaker 3>The way it worked is you would get a ton</v>
<v Speaker 3>of guns anywhere from several hundred to</v>

3412
03:18:04.891 --> 03:18:09.891
<v Speaker 3>more than a thousand firing giant cannon</v>
<v Speaker 3>aids in front of your advancing forces,</v>

3413
03:18:12.390 --> 03:18:17.390
<v Speaker 3>creating a wall of explosions in front </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them and you would have it </v>

3414
03:18:17.390 --> 03:18:21.531
<v Speaker 3>coordinated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody would have their watch is </v>

3415
03:18:21.531 --> 03:18:21.531
<v Speaker 3>synchronized and the troops would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>told,</v>

3416
03:18:21.531 --> 03:18:25.731
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the first 20 minutes you were to </v>

3417
03:18:25.731 --> 03:18:25.731
<v Speaker 3>move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3418
03:18:25.731 --> 03:18:28.590
<v Speaker 3>100 yards forward and at this time the </v>
<v Speaker 3>barrage will shift another hundred yards</v>

3419
03:18:28.591 --> 03:18:33.591
<v Speaker 3>in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this was all worked out so that you </v>

3420
03:18:33.591 --> 03:18:34.440
<v Speaker 3>know the protective barraged supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep the troops safe as the,</v>

3421
03:18:34.500 --> 03:18:39.500
<v Speaker 3>as they advance toward the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the very last step of course is the </v>

3422
03:18:39.500 --> 03:18:42.120
<v Speaker 3>barrage will land right on the enemy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it will lift at the last second and</v>

3423
03:18:42.121 --> 03:18:47.121
<v Speaker 3>the enemy will look up and the British </v>
<v Speaker 3>forces will be right there standing in </v>

3424
03:18:47.121 --> 03:18:50.121
<v Speaker 3>front of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Having marched the whole with a giant </v>

3425
03:18:50.121 --> 03:18:50.121
<v Speaker 3>explosive force field,</v>
<v Speaker 3>protecting them.</v>

3426
03:18:50.770 --> 03:18:53.350
<v Speaker 3>As you might imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coordination is critical.</v>

3427
03:18:53.500 --> 03:18:56.140
<v Speaker 3>You screwed this up in one of two things</v>
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>

3428
03:18:56.560 --> 03:19:00.250
<v Speaker 3>The better thing is that the barrage </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets way ahead of the troops and they're</v>

3429
03:19:00.251 --> 03:19:05.251
<v Speaker 3>exposed to all the machine gunfire and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the stuff that barrage was supposed </v>

3430
03:19:05.251 --> 03:19:05.380
<v Speaker 3>to protect them from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the good part.</v>

3431
03:19:05.410 --> 03:19:10.410
<v Speaker 3>That's the best outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The worst outcome is that the barrage </v>

3432
03:19:10.410 --> 03:19:13.620
<v Speaker 3>short and that giant explosive wall </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's supposed to protect you from the </v>

3433
03:19:13.620 --> 03:19:14.590
<v Speaker 3>enemy instead decimates you.</v>

3434
03:19:15.830 --> 03:19:18.260
<v Speaker 3>When it works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fantastic.</v>

3435
03:19:18.530 --> 03:19:20.030
<v Speaker 3>At the battle of our us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it works.</v>

3436
03:19:20.120 --> 03:19:20.810
<v Speaker 3>Initially,</v>

3437
03:19:22.970 --> 03:19:25.040
<v Speaker 3>there'll be a bunch of innovations at </v>
<v Speaker 3>this battle.</v>

3438
03:19:25.250 --> 03:19:30.250
<v Speaker 3>Another one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again that has been tried before but </v>

3439
03:19:30.250 --> 03:19:32.561
<v Speaker 3>never quite like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as whole batteries have machine guns </v>

3440
03:19:32.561 --> 03:19:33.500
<v Speaker 3>will be used in what's called indirect </v>
<v Speaker 3>fire,</v>

3441
03:19:33.501 --> 03:19:37.700
<v Speaker 3>meaning they point them up to the sky so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the bullets ended up falling.</v>

3442
03:19:37.980 --> 03:19:38.780
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3443
03:19:38.781 --> 03:19:41.780
<v Speaker 3>Straight down on targets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could shoot over hills that way.</v>

3444
03:19:41.930 --> 03:19:43.970
<v Speaker 3>Not even seeing what you're shooting at </v>
<v Speaker 3>is one.</v>

3445
03:19:43.990 --> 03:19:48.410
<v Speaker 3>A historian explained it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like hosing down an important piece</v>

3446
03:19:48.411 --> 03:19:53.411
<v Speaker 3>of ground and they would have thousands </v>
<v Speaker 3>of machine gun bullets falling every </v>

3447
03:19:53.411 --> 03:19:55.190
<v Speaker 3>second on some of these important road </v>
<v Speaker 3>crossings and whatnot.</v>

3448
03:19:55.430 --> 03:19:56.540
<v Speaker 3>All through this battle.</v>

3449
03:19:58.070 --> 03:20:03.070
<v Speaker 3>One of the important elements at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>start of the battle is that so many of </v>

3450
03:20:03.070 --> 03:20:04.910
<v Speaker 3>the troops that are going to initially </v>
<v Speaker 3>rush the German side,</v>

3451
03:20:05.060 --> 03:20:07.040
<v Speaker 3>our underground at the start of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>battle,</v>

3452
03:20:07.041 --> 03:20:12.041
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of chalky ground in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of France and like a lot of these </v>

3453
03:20:12.041 --> 03:20:12.710
<v Speaker 3>battles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there will be a ton of digging.</v>

3454
03:20:13.070 --> 03:20:18.070
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four months the Germans and the British </v>

3455
03:20:18.070 --> 03:20:19.190
<v Speaker 3>on both sides have had sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tunneling war and occasionally,</v>

3456
03:20:19.420 --> 03:20:24.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>British tunnels toward the German front </v>

3457
03:20:24.420 --> 03:20:26.830
<v Speaker 3>run into German tunnelers going the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other way and they had these terrible </v>

3458
03:20:26.830 --> 03:20:27.140
<v Speaker 3>gun fights in the dark under ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3459
03:20:27.141 --> 03:20:28.610
<v Speaker 3>like troglodyte fighting.</v>

3460
03:20:30.800 --> 03:20:34.160
<v Speaker 3>Some sources say that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The moment the actual ground battle at a</v>

3461
03:20:34.170 --> 03:20:39.170
<v Speaker 3>Ross started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of these tunnels had gone up all </v>

3462
03:20:39.170 --> 03:20:40.250
<v Speaker 3>the way to the German lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just a couple of feet separated them</v>

3463
03:20:40.610 --> 03:20:43.940
<v Speaker 3>from the German trench lines and that at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the second the battle started.</v>

3464
03:20:43.941 --> 03:20:45.830
<v Speaker 3>They exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charges in those,</v>

3465
03:20:45.950 --> 03:20:48.860
<v Speaker 3>those little walls of dirt blew down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Canadians,</v>

3466
03:20:48.980 --> 03:20:50.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>storm through the breaches.</v>

3467
03:20:50.481 --> 03:20:55.481
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter what exactly happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Canadian storm wme Ridge now and </v>

3468
03:20:55.851 --> 03:21:00.851
<v Speaker 3>took it on the first day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a ridge that untold numbers of Frenchman</v>

3469
03:21:01.071 --> 03:21:06.071
<v Speaker 3>had died trying to take back in 1915.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge Canadian victory and the </v>

3470
03:21:07.281 --> 03:21:11.840
<v Speaker 3>Germans were in terrible trouble for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>short while at the battle of ours.</v>

3471
03:21:11.900 --> 03:21:13.670
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just Canadians.</v>

3472
03:21:13.671 --> 03:21:15.650
<v Speaker 3>They get a lot of credit and deservedly </v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3473
03:21:15.920 --> 03:21:17.600
<v Speaker 3>but there were Scotsman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

3474
03:21:17.601 --> 03:21:21.020
<v Speaker 3>up on the same hill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm dealing with all kinds of problems.</v>

3475
03:21:21.730 --> 03:21:21.960
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

3476
03:21:22.140 --> 03:21:27.140
<v Speaker 3>and yet for the first 24 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looked like Douglas Haig,</v>

3477
03:21:27.181 --> 03:21:31.350
<v Speaker 3>the British commander was going to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>on his hands the long awaited,</v>

3478
03:21:31.351 --> 03:21:34.260
<v Speaker 3>much fantasized about in his head </v>
<v Speaker 3>breakthrough</v>

3479
03:21:37.310 --> 03:21:42.310
<v Speaker 3>Ludin Dorf writes in his diaries that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a a dangerous moment and then and </v>

3480
03:21:42.310 --> 03:21:46.010
<v Speaker 3>then lamented the fact that here this </v>
<v Speaker 3>brand new defense in system he'd come up</v>

3481
03:21:46.011 --> 03:21:51.011
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all this work and all this money </v>

3482
03:21:51.011 --> 03:21:51.740
<v Speaker 3>spent was apparently useless against </v>
<v Speaker 3>these new British combined arms tactics.</v>

3483
03:21:52.040 --> 03:21:55.160
<v Speaker 3>That was until he figured out that his </v>
<v Speaker 3>commander on the scene,</v>

3484
03:21:55.161 --> 03:21:58.370
<v Speaker 3>a guy named Falcon House and a 70 </v>
<v Speaker 3>something year old guy,</v>

3485
03:21:58.700 --> 03:22:03.500
<v Speaker 3>hadn't quite figured out what he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to do with these new tactics.</v>

3486
03:22:03.501 --> 03:22:07.190
<v Speaker 3>They were still way too new and he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>done a bunch of things that were part of</v>

3487
03:22:07.191 --> 03:22:12.191
<v Speaker 3>the old tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He put all his guys for the most part </v>

3488
03:22:12.191 --> 03:22:14.801
<v Speaker 3>way up front where they could be taken </v>
<v Speaker 3>by the artillery more than two and a </v>

3489
03:22:14.871 --> 03:22:19.871
<v Speaker 3>half million British shells by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fired a in a shorter time than the </v>

3490
03:22:19.871 --> 03:22:24.821
<v Speaker 3>battle of the somme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he put his reserves that are </v>

3491
03:22:24.821 --> 03:22:28.451
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be there to plug any holes </v>
<v Speaker 3>15 miles back too far to do anything in </v>

3492
03:22:28.451 --> 03:22:28.760
<v Speaker 3>for a short period of time.</v>

3493
03:22:28.970 --> 03:22:33.970
<v Speaker 3>It looked like the British were going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>break through at this battle and then </v>

3494
03:22:33.970 --> 03:22:37.730
<v Speaker 3>just like all these other battles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it slows down.</v>

3495
03:22:38.090 --> 03:22:41.930
<v Speaker 3>Once the troops advanced beyond where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gunfire can help them,</v>

3496
03:22:42.140 --> 03:22:47.140
<v Speaker 3>then the guns behind them have to move </v>
<v Speaker 3>to and that takes time and everybody </v>

3497
03:22:47.140 --> 03:22:51.821
<v Speaker 3>gets tired and they begin to wear out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and while they're resting and </v>

3498
03:22:51.821 --> 03:22:52.610
<v Speaker 3>rejuvenating themselves for the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>push,</v>

3499
03:22:52.760 --> 03:22:57.760
<v Speaker 3>the Germans are bringing up their </v>
<v Speaker 3>reserves and the battle of Arras with </v>

3500
03:22:57.760 --> 03:23:01.361
<v Speaker 3>this wonderful first day in this capture</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this important vimy ridge turns into </v>

3501
03:23:01.361 --> 03:23:04.670
<v Speaker 3>just another one of these battles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the time it's over,</v>

3502
03:23:04.790 --> 03:23:09.110
<v Speaker 3>more than a month later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have like 150,000</v>

3503
03:23:09.111 --> 03:23:12.320
<v Speaker 3>British casualties and like 130,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>German ones.</v>

3504
03:23:12.321 --> 03:23:17.321
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found it interesting that the newer </v>

3505
03:23:17.321 --> 03:23:17.321
<v Speaker 3>histories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers of the casualties,</v>

3506
03:23:17.321 --> 03:23:19.070
<v Speaker 3>these battles is significantly higher </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the older ones.</v>

3507
03:23:19.430 --> 03:23:22.910
<v Speaker 3>I have some that say that 75,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>British died at this battle.</v>

3508
03:23:23.120 --> 03:23:25.670
<v Speaker 3>That's a big discrepancy in the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nonetheless,</v>

3509
03:23:25.910 --> 03:23:29.090
<v Speaker 3>the traditional numbers thrown out today</v>
<v Speaker 3>are well over 100,000</v>

3510
03:23:29.091 --> 03:23:30.770
<v Speaker 3>for both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3511
03:23:30.810 --> 03:23:34.850
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the joy over vinny was short lived.</v>

3512
03:23:35.840 --> 03:23:40.840
<v Speaker 3>And what had happened at this battle </v>
<v Speaker 3>would happen at a bunch of other first </v>

3513
03:23:40.840 --> 03:23:42.290
<v Speaker 3>world war battles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shows the difference between how well</v>

3514
03:23:42.440 --> 03:23:45.080
<v Speaker 3>the first stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually the first 24,</v>

3515
03:23:45.081 --> 03:23:50.081
<v Speaker 3>maybe 36 hours of these minute Lee </v>
<v Speaker 3>exquisitely planned encounters go the </v>

3516
03:23:50.081 --> 03:23:55.001
<v Speaker 3>part that's all been rehearsed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>trained for for months and months and </v>

3517
03:23:55.001 --> 03:23:57.260
<v Speaker 3>months goes great and you're able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make the coordination work,</v>

3518
03:23:57.650 --> 03:24:02.650
<v Speaker 3>but then the next jump in wherever you </v>
<v Speaker 3>are in these battles is the part that </v>

3519
03:24:02.650 --> 03:24:04.880
<v Speaker 3>becomes much more improvisational,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much more ad hoc.</v>

3520
03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:10.000
<v Speaker 3>You can't have a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know months in advance for what you </v>

3521
03:24:10.000 --> 03:24:13.751
<v Speaker 3>do on the second day of the battle </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're not really sure where </v>

3522
03:24:13.751 --> 03:24:13.751
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be the second day.</v>

3523
03:24:13.751 --> 03:24:15.920
<v Speaker 3>You may have some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that's what you're</v>

3524
03:24:15.921 --> 03:24:18.110
<v Speaker 3>going to do and and as many historians </v>
<v Speaker 3>point out,</v>

3525
03:24:18.111 --> 03:24:20.990
<v Speaker 3>when you look at the next jumps in any </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these offensive,</v>

3526
03:24:20.991 --> 03:24:25.991
<v Speaker 3>they are so much more haphazard and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>that coordination falls apart that you </v>

3527
03:24:25.991 --> 03:24:30.131
<v Speaker 3>don't see the wonderful results that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that months of preparation gave you for </v>

3528
03:24:30.131 --> 03:24:34.721
<v Speaker 3>24 or 36 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yet you can't break through these </v>

3529
03:24:34.721 --> 03:24:37.220
<v Speaker 3>kinds of deep defenses in that short of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a period of time.</v>

3530
03:24:37.221 --> 03:24:41.780
<v Speaker 3>You would have to have that combined </v>
<v Speaker 3>arms activity work as well as it did for</v>

3531
03:24:41.781 --> 03:24:46.200
<v Speaker 3>the first 24 hours at a Ross and be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to carry it through for a week or two.</v>

3532
03:24:47.190 --> 03:24:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a near run thing.</v>

3533
03:24:49.230 --> 03:24:51.090
<v Speaker 3>It's gone down in history as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a,</v>

3534
03:24:51.240 --> 03:24:53.640
<v Speaker 3>as a heroic encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mostly for the Canadians,</v>

3535
03:24:53.641 --> 03:24:56.970
<v Speaker 3>the largest endeavor they participated </v>
<v Speaker 3>in yet on the western front,</v>

3536
03:24:57.950 --> 03:25:00.180
<v Speaker 3>and I always have to remind myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3537
03:25:00.181 --> 03:25:04.200
<v Speaker 3>you look at this in an almost a field </v>
<v Speaker 3>marshal type fashion.</v>

3538
03:25:04.200 --> 03:25:05.700
<v Speaker 3>When you study this for military </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

3539
03:25:05.701 --> 03:25:08.700
<v Speaker 3>you see it the way the generals often </v>
<v Speaker 3>did these advancements on these maps.</v>

3540
03:25:08.701 --> 03:25:13.701
<v Speaker 3>What worked and what didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the coordination question that </v>

3541
03:25:13.701 --> 03:25:13.980
<v Speaker 3>the technical side of war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You always have to remember though,</v>

3542
03:25:13.981 --> 03:25:16.740
<v Speaker 3>and I always try to remind myself to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people on the ground.</v>

3543
03:25:16.741 --> 03:25:20.790
<v Speaker 3>This is not so technical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Philip Gibbs was there.</v>

3544
03:25:21.450 --> 03:25:26.450
<v Speaker 3>He was in the tunnels with the troops as</v>
<v Speaker 3>they came back from these encounters up </v>

3545
03:25:28.081 --> 03:25:33.081
<v Speaker 3>on vimeo ridge and places like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gibbs gives you a real feel for what it </v>

3546
03:25:33.081 --> 03:25:33.750
<v Speaker 3>was like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He writes,</v>

3547
03:25:33.751 --> 03:25:38.751
<v Speaker 3>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were tunnels beneath Ross through </v>

3548
03:25:38.751 --> 03:25:39.570
<v Speaker 3>which are men advanced to the German </v>
<v Speaker 3>lines,</v>

3549
03:25:39.810 --> 03:25:44.810
<v Speaker 3>and I went along them when one line of </v>
<v Speaker 3>men was going into battle and another </v>

3550
03:25:44.810 --> 03:25:48.621
<v Speaker 3>was coming back wounded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them blind bloody vomiting with </v>

3551
03:25:48.621 --> 03:25:53.070
<v Speaker 3>the fumes of gas in their lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their steel hats clinking as they groped</v>

3552
03:25:53.071 --> 03:25:54.180
<v Speaker 3>past one another.</v>

3553
03:25:54.480 --> 03:25:59.280
<v Speaker 3>Involves on each side of these passages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men played cards on barrels to the light</v>

3554
03:25:59.281 --> 03:26:04.281
<v Speaker 3>of candles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuck in bottles or slept until their </v>

3555
03:26:04.281 --> 03:26:05.310
<v Speaker 3>turn to fight with gas masks for their </v>
<v Speaker 3>pillows.</v>

3556
03:26:06.870 --> 03:26:09.390
<v Speaker 3>He says outside the citadel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning of the city.</v>

3557
03:26:09.900 --> 03:26:14.900
<v Speaker 3>There were long queues of wounded men </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking their turn to the surgeons who </v>

3558
03:26:14.900 --> 03:26:17.940
<v Speaker 3>were working in a deep crypt with a high</v>
<v Speaker 3>vaulted roof.</v>

3559
03:26:18.180 --> 03:26:21.810
<v Speaker 3>One day there were 3000 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Silent patient,</v>

3560
03:26:21.960 --> 03:26:26.490
<v Speaker 3>muddy bloodstained,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blind boys or men with smashed faces,</v>

3561
03:26:26.491 --> 03:26:31.491
<v Speaker 3>swapped in bloody rags,</v>
<v Speaker 3>groped forward to the dark passages </v>

3562
03:26:31.491 --> 03:26:34.080
<v Speaker 3>leading to the vault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>led by comrades on the grass outside lay</v>

3563
03:26:34.081 --> 03:26:37.290
<v Speaker 3>men with leg wounds and stomach wounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the quote,</v>

3564
03:26:38.760 --> 03:26:43.560
<v Speaker 3>Norman Collins is an officer with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Scottish fourth seaforth highlanders,</v>

3565
03:26:43.561 --> 03:26:48.561
<v Speaker 3>and they're there to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Collins just tells these stories </v>

3566
03:26:48.561 --> 03:26:52.911
<v Speaker 3>that reminds you of the very strange </v>
<v Speaker 3>moral positions,</v>

3567
03:26:53.281 --> 03:26:55.500
<v Speaker 3>these kinds of conflicts puts you in.</v>

3568
03:26:55.920 --> 03:27:00.920
<v Speaker 3>Collins talks about the fact that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were actually shown how to kill one of </v>

3569
03:27:02.671 --> 03:27:07.410
<v Speaker 3>their own men on the battlefield because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the pain and suffering that they were</v>

3570
03:27:07.411 --> 03:27:11.010
<v Speaker 3>enduring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this isn't specific to this battle,</v>

3571
03:27:11.220 --> 03:27:16.220
<v Speaker 3>this happened on the battlefields </v>
<v Speaker 3>throughout the first world war in </v>

3572
03:27:16.220 --> 03:27:18.570
<v Speaker 3>basically every army you know that got </v>
<v Speaker 3>caught in these conditions.</v>

3573
03:27:18.571 --> 03:27:23.571
<v Speaker 3>These are human problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the physics of humankind on these 20th </v>

3574
03:27:23.571 --> 03:27:25.290
<v Speaker 3>century battlefields.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The results are predictable,</v>

3575
03:27:25.620 --> 03:27:30.620
<v Speaker 3>horrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and pitiable collins writes,</v>

3576
03:27:30.990 --> 03:27:33.600
<v Speaker 3>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after such intense fighting,</v>

3577
03:27:33.601 --> 03:27:36.300
<v Speaker 3>you always had men lying out in no man's</v>
<v Speaker 3>land,</v>

3578
03:27:36.540 --> 03:27:40.350
<v Speaker 3>probably with their testicles blown off </v>
<v Speaker 3>and crying in agony and laying out there</v>

3579
03:27:40.351 --> 03:27:42.430
<v Speaker 3>all night long in the dark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the rain,</v>

3580
03:27:42.790 --> 03:27:45.880
<v Speaker 3>most would never have survived,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you had a choice.</v>

3581
03:27:46.120 --> 03:27:48.760
<v Speaker 3>They could die in agony or you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot them.</v>

3582
03:27:49.150 --> 03:27:51.430
<v Speaker 3>You were shown how to do the thing very </v>
<v Speaker 3>cleanly.</v>

3583
03:27:51.520 --> 03:27:56.520
<v Speaker 3>You would take your 45 revolver and talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the man and kneel behind him and </v>

3584
03:27:56.591 --> 03:27:58.750
<v Speaker 3>whilst you were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulled the trigger,</v>

3585
03:27:59.050 --> 03:28:04.050
<v Speaker 3>put a bullet through the back of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>head and immediately the whole front </v>

3586
03:28:04.050 --> 03:28:04.210
<v Speaker 3>skull came away and they were dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>instantly.</v>

3587
03:28:04.390 --> 03:28:07.270
<v Speaker 3>There was no pain about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I can honestly say this,</v>

3588
03:28:07.540 --> 03:28:10.060
<v Speaker 3>that I never had the courage because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it took.</v>

3589
03:28:10.330 --> 03:28:13.270
<v Speaker 3>I never had the courage myself to shoot </v>
<v Speaker 3>a wounded soldier.</v>

3590
03:28:13.480 --> 03:28:16.750
<v Speaker 3>I carried out the operation many times </v>
<v Speaker 3>afterwards on animals.</v>

3591
03:28:16.990 --> 03:28:19.630
<v Speaker 3>I could kill a pet dog far better than a</v>
<v Speaker 3>vet could,</v>

3592
03:28:19.840 --> 03:28:22.120
<v Speaker 3>but I was never able to shoot a wounded </v>
<v Speaker 3>soldier.</v>

3593
03:28:22.330 --> 03:28:24.730
<v Speaker 3>I probably should have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend auto,</v>

3594
03:28:24.731 --> 03:28:28.480
<v Speaker 3>Murray Dixon was wounded in the stomach </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the irs attack in April.</v>

3595
03:28:28.660 --> 03:28:30.910
<v Speaker 3>He was in great agony from what I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>told.</v>

3596
03:28:31.120 --> 03:28:33.880
<v Speaker 3>The kindest thing would've been to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 3>him on the battlefield.</v>

3597
03:28:34.090 --> 03:28:39.090
<v Speaker 3>Instead of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they took him back to the hospital and </v>

3598
03:28:39.090 --> 03:28:41.251
<v Speaker 3>he died two days later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a tremendous thing to shoot a </v>

3599
03:28:41.251 --> 03:28:43.240
<v Speaker 3>friend even though he's in agony and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>just didn't have the courage to do it.</v>

3600
03:28:43.600 --> 03:28:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Most of them died overnight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but of course they didn't.</v>

3601
03:28:45.881 --> 03:28:48.560
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure the quote,</v>

3602
03:28:50.850 --> 03:28:55.850
<v Speaker 3>there are battles coming up with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers of people who were either shot </v>

3603
03:28:56.041 --> 03:29:01.041
<v Speaker 3>by their own men or begged to be will </v>
<v Speaker 3>skyrocket.</v>

3604
03:29:02.850 --> 03:29:06.060
<v Speaker 3>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this battle was tough enough.</v>

3605
03:29:06.990 --> 03:29:11.990
<v Speaker 3>The initial stages of elation at taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like Vimeo Ridge became</v>

3606
03:29:13.700 --> 03:29:18.700
<v Speaker 3>nightmarish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As the month went on and the casualties </v>

3607
03:29:18.700 --> 03:29:22.751
<v Speaker 3>piled up before long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the British were suffering for thousand </v>

3608
03:29:22.751 --> 03:29:26.801
<v Speaker 3>casualties a day at a Ross and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting to the morale of the troops.</v>

3609
03:29:27.860 --> 03:29:32.860
<v Speaker 3>Gibbs tells a story about arriving on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>scene right after a bunch of men just </v>

3610
03:29:32.860 --> 03:29:37.661
<v Speaker 3>behind the front had been blown up in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their bath together and the bath is </v>

3611
03:29:37.661 --> 03:29:41.510
<v Speaker 3>strewn with body parts and blood and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a soldier he knows sits down to talk</v>

3612
03:29:41.511 --> 03:29:46.040
<v Speaker 3>about you know how things are going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the soldier is clearly at the end of</v>

3613
03:29:46.041 --> 03:29:48.350
<v Speaker 3>his rope as far as what he's willing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>put up with.</v>

3614
03:29:49.190 --> 03:29:49.910
<v Speaker 3>He writes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quote,</v>

3615
03:29:50.480 --> 03:29:54.590
<v Speaker 3>a few minutes before our meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a shell had crashed into a bath close to</v>

3616
03:29:54.591 --> 03:29:56.690
<v Speaker 3>their hut where men were watching </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

3617
03:29:56.930 --> 03:30:00.020
<v Speaker 3>The explosion filled the bath with blood</v>
<v Speaker 3>and bits of flesh.</v>

3618
03:30:00.260 --> 03:30:05.260
<v Speaker 3>The younger officers stared at me under </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tilt forward of his steel hat and </v>

3619
03:30:05.260 --> 03:30:05.510
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hello gibbs.</v>

3620
03:30:05.810 --> 03:30:09.890
<v Speaker 3>I'd played chess with him at grooms cafe</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fleet street in days before the war.</v>

3621
03:30:10.160 --> 03:30:13.520
<v Speaker 3>I went back to his hut and had tea with </v>
<v Speaker 3>him close to that bath,</v>

3622
03:30:13.730 --> 03:30:17.840
<v Speaker 3>hoping we should not get caught up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cake and quote.</v>

3623
03:30:19.460 --> 03:30:20.720
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this battle,</v>

3624
03:30:20.721 --> 03:30:25.721
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is known for how wonderfully competent </v>

3625
03:30:25.721 --> 03:30:29.350
<v Speaker 3>the integration of all the different </v>
<v Speaker 3>elements were to make this battle so </v>

3626
03:30:29.350 --> 03:30:32.921
<v Speaker 3>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not how the guy on the ground </v>

3627
03:30:32.921 --> 03:30:35.171
<v Speaker 3>sees it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Though Gibbs says that his friend he's </v>

3628
03:30:35.171 --> 03:30:37.490
<v Speaker 3>having tea with says quote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had heard before,</v>

3629
03:30:37.491 --> 03:30:40.250
<v Speaker 3>some harsh words about our general staff</v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

3630
03:30:40.550 --> 03:30:43.250
<v Speaker 3>but never anything so passionate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so violent,</v>

3631
03:30:43.251 --> 03:30:48.251
<v Speaker 3>is from that gunner officer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His view of the business was summed up </v>

3632
03:30:48.251 --> 03:30:51.641
<v Speaker 3>in the word murder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He raged against the impossible orders </v>

3633
03:30:51.641 --> 03:30:55.541
<v Speaker 3>sent down from headquarters against the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brutality with which men were left in </v>

3634
03:30:55.541 --> 03:30:59.270
<v Speaker 3>the line week after week and against the</v>
<v Speaker 3>monstrous abominable futility of all our</v>

3635
03:30:59.271 --> 03:31:02.600
<v Speaker 3>so called strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His nerves were in rags,</v>

3636
03:31:02.601 --> 03:31:04.580
<v Speaker 3>as I could see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way in which his hands shook.</v>

3637
03:31:04.760 --> 03:31:06.830
<v Speaker 3>When he lighted one cigarette after </v>
<v Speaker 3>another,</v>

3638
03:31:07.070 --> 03:31:11.300
<v Speaker 3>his spirit was in a flame of revolt </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the misery of his sleeplessness,</v>

3639
03:31:11.480 --> 03:31:15.950
<v Speaker 3>filth and imminent peril of death and </v>
<v Speaker 3>quote.</v>

3640
03:31:18.370 --> 03:31:23.370
<v Speaker 3>If British reporter Philip Gibbs thinks </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's a high level of discontent </v>

3641
03:31:23.370 --> 03:31:25.210
<v Speaker 3>and perhaps in the British army,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>

3642
03:31:25.930 --> 03:31:29.650
<v Speaker 3>You ought to see what's going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>French army at about the same time</v>

3643
03:31:31.780 --> 03:31:36.780
<v Speaker 3>in France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a great drama is unfolding during this </v>

3644
03:31:36.780 --> 03:31:39.490
<v Speaker 3>time period because right before these </v>
<v Speaker 3>offensives are scheduled to start,</v>

3645
03:31:40.000 --> 03:31:45.000
<v Speaker 3>the French government falls and new </v>
<v Speaker 3>political leaders take over a new </v>

3646
03:31:45.000 --> 03:31:45.880
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a new war minister.</v>

3647
03:31:45.881 --> 03:31:50.881
<v Speaker 3>All these civilian leaders have changed </v>
<v Speaker 3>and these civilian leaders have a very </v>

3648
03:31:50.881 --> 03:31:53.110
<v Speaker 3>different attitude towards this </v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive that's about to start than the</v>

3649
03:31:53.111 --> 03:31:56.470
<v Speaker 3>people they succeeded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This causes huge problems.</v>

3650
03:31:56.471 --> 03:31:58.690
<v Speaker 3>The first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not big fans of novel,</v>

3651
03:31:59.320 --> 03:32:04.320
<v Speaker 3>but join the club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are lots of people who wonder why </v>

3652
03:32:04.320 --> 03:32:04.320
<v Speaker 3>this guy got the top job when there were</v>
<v Speaker 3>several,</v>

3653
03:32:04.560 --> 03:32:06.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>superior figures,</v>

3654
03:32:06.101 --> 03:32:08.580
<v Speaker 3>really August people who could have </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten it.</v>

3655
03:32:08.600 --> 03:32:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Potassium follow people like that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting in the wings and they gave it to</v>

3656
03:32:12.101 --> 03:32:14.350
<v Speaker 3>a much more junior person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3657
03:32:14.380 --> 03:32:19.380
<v Speaker 3>but for political reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he fit that last government in </v>

3658
03:32:19.380 --> 03:32:19.690
<v Speaker 3>ways that were good for that last </v>
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>

3659
03:32:19.691 --> 03:32:24.691
<v Speaker 3>but now that last government was gone </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the new one that comes into power </v>

3660
03:32:24.691 --> 03:32:25.420
<v Speaker 3>would've rather had any one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>

3661
03:32:26.680 --> 03:32:28.330
<v Speaker 3>What's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't like his plan,</v>

3662
03:32:28.990 --> 03:32:33.990
<v Speaker 3>his idea for this great thunderbolts </v>
<v Speaker 3>assault with all this artillery that's </v>

3663
03:32:33.990 --> 03:32:34.930
<v Speaker 3>going to end the war in 48 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not buying it.</v>

3664
03:32:35.540 --> 03:32:36.740
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

3665
03:32:36.741 --> 03:32:41.741
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people are drinking the Robert </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nouvelle Koolaid and getting into this </v>

3666
03:32:41.741 --> 03:32:44.560
<v Speaker 3>optimistic mood about this thunderbolt </v>
<v Speaker 3>ending the war,</v>

3667
03:32:45.850 --> 03:32:50.850
<v Speaker 3>but the new government's pretty sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's not what's going to happen </v>

3668
03:32:50.850 --> 03:32:53.010
<v Speaker 3>and they've got some people who ought to</v>
<v Speaker 3>know sending the message.</v>

3669
03:32:53.011 --> 03:32:58.011
<v Speaker 3>Just warning them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are other military commanders in </v>

3670
03:32:58.011 --> 03:32:58.390
<v Speaker 3>France who are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>call this thing off.</v>

3671
03:32:58.570 --> 03:33:02.410
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are people who are actually</v>

3672
03:33:02.411 --> 03:33:07.411
<v Speaker 3>subordinate to Nevada and who have jobs </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do in this coming offensive that </v>

3673
03:33:08.901 --> 03:33:11.200
<v Speaker 3>scaring the government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you might imagine,</v>

3674
03:33:13.380 --> 03:33:18.380
<v Speaker 3>this is all part of this growing </v>
<v Speaker 3>interference with politicians in the </v>

3675
03:33:18.691 --> 03:33:23.691
<v Speaker 3>affairs of generals and this is one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those times where there sort of a face </v>

3676
03:33:23.691 --> 03:33:27.591
<v Speaker 3>off I'm eating is called between the new</v>
<v Speaker 3>war minister and novel in late March and</v>

3677
03:33:29.071 --> 03:33:34.071
<v Speaker 3>the new war minister wants to convince </v>
<v Speaker 3>devel to call this whole offensive off </v>

3678
03:33:34.071 --> 03:33:35.370
<v Speaker 3>and they're almost impossible thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

3679
03:33:35.371 --> 03:33:40.371
<v Speaker 3>As we said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the time you reach stages where </v>

3680
03:33:40.371 --> 03:33:41.550
<v Speaker 3>you're just finishing the last touches </v>
<v Speaker 3>ready to go.</v>

3681
03:33:41.551 --> 03:33:46.551
<v Speaker 3>It's taken months and months and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>training and the rehearsals and the </v>

3682
03:33:46.551 --> 03:33:46.650
<v Speaker 3>money spent and all this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now the government,</v>

3683
03:33:46.651 --> 03:33:48.980
<v Speaker 3>the civilian leaders who don't know </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything about war,</v>

3684
03:33:49.320 --> 03:33:51.990
<v Speaker 3>any general would think want to call it </v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

3685
03:33:52.230 --> 03:33:55.500
<v Speaker 3>My reputation relies on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of personal motives</v>

3686
03:33:55.890 --> 03:33:58.680
<v Speaker 3>and the war minister has some good </v>
<v Speaker 3>arguments.</v>

3687
03:33:59.880 --> 03:34:01.080
<v Speaker 3>He tries to tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3688
03:34:01.470 --> 03:34:04.470
<v Speaker 3>everything's changed since you first </v>
<v Speaker 3>formulated this plan.</v>

3689
03:34:04.471 --> 03:34:07.530
<v Speaker 3>When did just be prudent to reevaluate?</v>

3690
03:34:09.420 --> 03:34:14.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Germans pulled back from their old </v>

3691
03:34:14.420 --> 03:34:15.420
<v Speaker 3>positions to these new positions on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>siegfried line and other places,</v>

3692
03:34:15.421 --> 03:34:17.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one big change,</v>

3693
03:34:18.000 --> 03:34:23.000
<v Speaker 3>but not just that the war minister tries</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make the case that all of these big </v>

3694
03:34:23.000 --> 03:34:25.350
<v Speaker 3>events are happening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These trends coming together,</v>

3695
03:34:25.351 --> 03:34:30.351
<v Speaker 3>everything we've talked about on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>program up to date are coming to the </v>

3696
03:34:30.991 --> 03:34:35.991
<v Speaker 3>fore at the same time in late March when</v>
<v Speaker 3>the war minister is talking to novel </v>

3697
03:34:36.310 --> 03:34:41.310
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States is just about to get </v>

3698
03:34:41.310 --> 03:34:43.911
<v Speaker 3>in the war and everyone knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Russian revolution has just </v>

3699
03:34:43.911 --> 03:34:47.541
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The submarines are about to enter into </v>

3700
03:34:47.541 --> 03:34:49.380
<v Speaker 3>the month where they sink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eight hundred and 40,000</v>

3701
03:34:49.381 --> 03:34:54.381
<v Speaker 3>tons of allied shipping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot going on and Francis warm </v>

3702
03:34:54.381 --> 03:34:55.980
<v Speaker 3>minister tries to tell Nevada lit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

3703
03:34:56.280 --> 03:34:57.420
<v Speaker 3>no one's going to hold you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3704
03:34:57.510 --> 03:34:59.450
<v Speaker 3>everything's changed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we should reevaluate.</v>

3705
03:34:59.460 --> 03:35:00.510
<v Speaker 3>Novel says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3706
03:35:02.100 --> 03:35:07.100
<v Speaker 3>The government gets even more desperate </v>
<v Speaker 3>as the offensive nears and presses him </v>

3707
03:35:07.921 --> 03:35:12.600
<v Speaker 3>and he pulls the takeaway card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says to the government,</v>

3708
03:35:12.601 --> 03:35:14.730
<v Speaker 3>either you back me on this or I </v>
<v Speaker 3>resigned,</v>

3709
03:35:16.290 --> 03:35:19.380
<v Speaker 3>and everything I've read says that this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a crisis for the French government at</v>

3710
03:35:19.381 --> 03:35:21.330
<v Speaker 3>this point for all sorts of internal </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons.</v>

3711
03:35:21.660 --> 03:35:26.660
<v Speaker 3>It was likely to bring the government </v>
<v Speaker 3>down if they fired novell right before </v>

3712
03:35:26.660 --> 03:35:30.531
<v Speaker 3>his offensive was supposed to take hold </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everyone had bought into the </v>

3713
03:35:30.531 --> 03:35:33.291
<v Speaker 3>optimism and drank the Koolaid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had almost no choice in this </v>

3714
03:35:33.291 --> 03:35:34.920
<v Speaker 3>confrontation between politicians and </v>
<v Speaker 3>generals and the government backed down,</v>

3715
03:35:35.460 --> 03:35:39.720
<v Speaker 3>but it was even worse than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government knew because the Germans knew</v>

3716
03:35:39.840 --> 03:35:44.840
<v Speaker 3>all about novels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>plans in detail to major incidents.</v>

3717
03:35:45.710 --> 03:35:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one involving captured documents that </v>

3718
03:35:50.710 --> 03:35:52.851
<v Speaker 3>never should have been anywhere near the</v>
<v Speaker 3>front lines that the Germans got their </v>

3719
03:35:52.851 --> 03:35:52.851
<v Speaker 3>hands on in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a raid,</v>

3720
03:35:52.851 --> 03:35:54.390
<v Speaker 3>and then an officer that they captured.</v>

3721
03:35:54.390 --> 03:35:59.390
<v Speaker 3>And we're able to find out more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Germans knew all about the French </v>

3722
03:35:59.390 --> 03:36:00.120
<v Speaker 3>plans and when they were going to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>place and what was going to happen.</v>

3723
03:36:01.320 --> 03:36:03.840
<v Speaker 3>And they had known in general for </v>
<v Speaker 3>months,</v>

3724
03:36:04.140 --> 03:36:06.270
<v Speaker 3>air reconnaissance had told them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3725
03:36:06.271 --> 03:36:11.271
<v Speaker 3>these giant affairs are like giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>supply dumps that go on for miles and </v>

3726
03:36:11.271 --> 03:36:14.811
<v Speaker 3>miles and miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to keep the enemy </v>

3727
03:36:14.811 --> 03:36:14.811
<v Speaker 3>from finding out about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in January,</v>

3728
03:36:14.811 --> 03:36:19.761
<v Speaker 3>the Germans had about nine divisions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite novell's armies by the time </v>

3729
03:36:20.521 --> 03:36:25.521
<v Speaker 3>novels about to launch this attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Germans have 48 and they're waiting </v>

3730
03:36:26.640 --> 03:36:28.050
<v Speaker 3>and it's a disaster.</v>

3731
03:36:29.190 --> 03:36:31.240
<v Speaker 3>Historian holds your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her vague writes quote,</v>

3732
03:36:32.040 --> 03:36:35.740
<v Speaker 3>after several delays due to foul weather</v>
<v Speaker 3>novel 16th,</v>

3733
03:36:35.741 --> 03:36:38.650
<v Speaker 3>April unleashed is our telleria for nine</v>
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>

3734
03:36:38.800 --> 03:36:43.800
<v Speaker 3>and then mounted is infantry charge in </v>
<v Speaker 3>driving rain reports from agents and </v>

3735
03:36:43.800 --> 03:36:48.691
<v Speaker 3>French pow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's had tipped the Germans off to the </v>

3736
03:36:48.691 --> 03:36:51.721
<v Speaker 3>coming offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Given the news of the offensive and the </v>

3737
03:36:51.721 --> 03:36:54.511
<v Speaker 3>difficulty of the terrain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Germans were able to halt the main </v>

3738
03:36:54.511 --> 03:36:55.270
<v Speaker 3>attack before it got beyond their first </v>
<v Speaker 3>line.</v>

3739
03:36:55.480 --> 03:37:00.480
<v Speaker 3>Whereas novell had forecast a </v>
<v Speaker 3>penetration of seven or eight miles on </v>

3740
03:37:00.480 --> 03:37:01.750
<v Speaker 3>the opening day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The French rarely advanced,</v>

3741
03:37:01.751 --> 03:37:04.870
<v Speaker 3>more than one or two miles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Losses were horrendous.</v>

3742
03:37:05.080 --> 03:37:07.720
<v Speaker 3>Whereas novell had coldly predicted </v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000</v>

3743
03:37:07.721 --> 03:37:09.340
<v Speaker 3>casualties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For the first day.</v>

3744
03:37:09.580 --> 03:37:12.520
<v Speaker 3>The number was 10 times greater after </v>
<v Speaker 3>the war.</v>

3745
03:37:12.610 --> 03:37:17.610
<v Speaker 3>The historical surface of the French </v>
<v Speaker 3>general staff placed casualties for the </v>

3746
03:37:17.610 --> 03:37:19.510
<v Speaker 3>first four days of the offensive at </v>
<v Speaker 3>30,000</v>

3747
03:37:19.511 --> 03:37:21.370
<v Speaker 3>killed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100,000</v>

3748
03:37:21.371 --> 03:37:24.570
<v Speaker 3>wounded and 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>missing end quote.</v>

3749
03:37:26.180 --> 03:37:31.180
<v Speaker 3>The story of what happened at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>battle of novels is a wonderful</v>

3750
03:37:32.600 --> 03:37:37.600
<v Speaker 3>no demonstration of how many things can </v>
<v Speaker 3>go wrong when you're trying to </v>

3751
03:37:37.600 --> 03:37:39.620
<v Speaker 3>synchronize everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So carefully start with the weather.</v>

3752
03:37:40.040 --> 03:37:42.710
<v Speaker 3>Just like at a Ross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a week before the weather was bad.</v>

3753
03:37:43.020 --> 03:37:43.950
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3754
03:37:43.990 --> 03:37:47.600
<v Speaker 3>who has snow during a spring offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what the French face,</v>

3755
03:37:47.601 --> 03:37:48.320
<v Speaker 3>sleet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>snow,</v>

3756
03:37:48.321 --> 03:37:51.500
<v Speaker 3>rain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>creating mud that slowed the progress of</v>

3757
03:37:51.501 --> 03:37:56.501
<v Speaker 3>the infantry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which had been calculated precisely to </v>

3758
03:37:56.501 --> 03:37:59.060
<v Speaker 3>keep up with the explosive force field </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the creeping barrage,</v>

3759
03:37:59.061 --> 03:38:04.061
<v Speaker 3>which this guy in the veil had pioneered</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in for done but never on this kind </v>

3760
03:38:04.061 --> 03:38:05.270
<v Speaker 3>of a scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in this case,</v>

3761
03:38:05.690 --> 03:38:10.690
<v Speaker 3>the barrage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the force field got way ahead of the </v>

3762
03:38:10.690 --> 03:38:13.540
<v Speaker 3>troops exposing the troops to just </v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievable amounts of machine gunfire.</v>

3763
03:38:13.610 --> 03:38:17.960
<v Speaker 3>There's one part of this front where the</v>
<v Speaker 3>French have to travel for ever.</v>

3764
03:38:17.961 --> 03:38:20.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>miles to take this,</v>

3765
03:38:21.880 --> 03:38:23.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>height in the distance and and in,</v>

3766
03:38:23.740 --> 03:38:24.760
<v Speaker 3>in this ridge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've,</v>

3767
03:38:24.910 --> 03:38:27.970
<v Speaker 3>the Germans have cut all these little </v>
<v Speaker 3>holes into the side of it,</v>

3768
03:38:28.000 --> 03:38:28.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

3769
03:38:28.700 --> 03:38:31.780
<v Speaker 3>to add to the ravines and the gorgeous </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything that are already in it,</v>

3770
03:38:31.781 --> 03:38:36.781
<v Speaker 3>and they've stuffed machine guns into </v>
<v Speaker 3>every hole that you can fit into this </v>

3771
03:38:36.781 --> 03:38:38.110
<v Speaker 3>hillside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got about 4,000</v>

3772
03:38:38.111 --> 03:38:43.111
<v Speaker 3>of them trained on this French infantry </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to cross this space and at Eros </v>

3773
03:38:45.280 --> 03:38:50.280
<v Speaker 3>and here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when you read the history </v>

3774
03:38:50.280 --> 03:38:52.741
<v Speaker 3>books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sound like relatively productive </v>

3775
03:38:52.741 --> 03:38:56.191
<v Speaker 3>first world war battles because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>soldiers actually take quite a bit more </v>

3776
03:38:56.191 --> 03:38:56.860
<v Speaker 3>ground than they did in the earlier </v>
<v Speaker 3>battles.</v>

3777
03:38:57.070 --> 03:39:02.070
<v Speaker 3>But that's sort of deceiving because </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is all part of the new German </v>

3778
03:39:02.070 --> 03:39:05.641
<v Speaker 3>strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This defense in depth with the Germans </v>

3779
03:39:05.641 --> 03:39:08.551
<v Speaker 3>aren't supposed to fight to the depth </v>
<v Speaker 3>all up on the front lines now and not </v>

3780
03:39:08.551 --> 03:39:11.371
<v Speaker 3>give an inch of ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're supposed to fight to a </v>

3781
03:39:11.371 --> 03:39:11.860
<v Speaker 3>reasonable degree and then retire to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>next line of defense.</v>

3782
03:39:12.100 --> 03:39:14.290
<v Speaker 3>So they're letting the enemy have more </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>

3783
03:39:14.470 --> 03:39:16.930
<v Speaker 3>They're just killing more of them while </v>
<v Speaker 3>they retreat.</v>

3784
03:39:18.600 --> 03:39:21.670
<v Speaker 3>The French actually stumble in to these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3785
03:39:22.070 --> 03:39:25.950
<v Speaker 3>first line areas and think that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>winning because they're just not finding</v>

3786
03:39:25.951 --> 03:39:30.951
<v Speaker 3>that many Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the Germans opened up on them </v>

3787
03:39:30.951 --> 03:39:30.951
<v Speaker 3>from the second line positions,</v>

3788
03:39:32.030 --> 03:39:33.980
<v Speaker 3>as you might imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a</v>

3789
03:39:33.980 --> 03:39:38.980
<v Speaker 4>government that had been assured that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll call this thing off in 48 hours.</v>

3790
03:39:39.620 --> 03:39:44.620
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was going to try to cash in on that </v>

3791
03:39:44.620 --> 03:39:47.531
<v Speaker 4>guarantee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They actually gave novel and extra day </v>

3792
03:39:47.531 --> 03:39:50.570
<v Speaker 4>on his 48 our promise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's how writer Gj Meyer describes the</v>

3793
03:39:50.571 --> 03:39:55.571
<v Speaker 4>situation where the politicians come to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the general and tell him to call the </v>

3794
03:39:55.571 --> 03:39:58.160
<v Speaker 4>whole thing off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you guaranteed it wasn't going to be</v>

3795
03:39:58.161 --> 03:40:03.161
<v Speaker 4>another song.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guaranteed we're going to win the </v>

3796
03:40:03.161 --> 03:40:05.110
<v Speaker 4>war with this thunderbolt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here's what my writes quote.</v>

3797
03:40:05.930 --> 03:40:09.950
<v Speaker 4>On April 19th,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three days after the attack starts,</v>

3798
03:40:10.670 --> 03:40:15.670
<v Speaker 4>the war minister intervened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to get Lavelle to stop the </v>

3799
03:40:15.670 --> 03:40:18.860
<v Speaker 4>general who in demanding approval of his</v>
<v Speaker 4>grand plan had promised to call it off.</v>

3800
03:40:18.890 --> 03:40:21.590
<v Speaker 4>If a breakthrough were not achieved </v>
<v Speaker 4>within 48 hours,</v>

3801
03:40:21.890 --> 03:40:25.760
<v Speaker 4>refused the very next day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he found that his chagrin however,</v>

3802
03:40:25.940 --> 03:40:29.210
<v Speaker 4>that he had no choice but to pause the </v>
<v Speaker 4>divisions at the front.</v>

3803
03:40:29.211 --> 03:40:34.211
<v Speaker 4>We're breaking down both their morale </v>
<v Speaker 4>and their supplies of ammunition </v>

3804
03:40:34.211 --> 03:40:35.780
<v Speaker 4>dangerously low laid on the day after </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3805
03:40:35.781 --> 03:40:39.290
<v Speaker 4>April 21st a new phenomenon appeared and</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote</v>

3806
03:40:41.840 --> 03:40:46.840
<v Speaker 3>John Keegan among other historians has </v>
<v Speaker 3>gone to great length to point out how </v>

3807
03:40:46.840 --> 03:40:51.011
<v Speaker 3>there's an accordion like backup that </v>
<v Speaker 3>begins once the timetable is Intel to </v>

3808
03:40:52.161 --> 03:40:57.161
<v Speaker 3>strictly when the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the front elements of these French </v>

3809
03:40:57.161 --> 03:40:59.771
<v Speaker 3>forces get bogged down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything behind it gets traffic </v>

3810
03:40:59.771 --> 03:41:01.460
<v Speaker 3>jammed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've quoted Louis Bar toss a French.</v>

3811
03:41:01.461 --> 03:41:05.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm corporal in the story several times </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Bartos is at this battle,</v>

3812
03:41:05.810 --> 03:41:10.810
<v Speaker 3>but he never sees anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets stuck in one of these traffic </v>

3813
03:41:10.810 --> 03:41:11.390
<v Speaker 3>jams and as far as he knows something's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>

3814
03:41:11.391 --> 03:41:16.391
<v Speaker 3>a mile or two in front of him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he doesn't ever get there to find </v>

3815
03:41:16.391 --> 03:41:19.271
<v Speaker 3>out what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the soldiers who find out what it is </v>

3816
03:41:19.271 --> 03:41:19.940
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>begin to react,</v>

3817
03:41:19.941 --> 03:41:22.580
<v Speaker 3>as one might imagine from the horror,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in this case,</v>

3818
03:41:22.581 --> 03:41:27.380
<v Speaker 3>the tip of the spear in one of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>areas are French colonial troops.</v>

3819
03:41:29.070 --> 03:41:32.190
<v Speaker 3>The story of what happened was relayed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to British journalists.</v>

3820
03:41:32.210 --> 03:41:33.630
<v Speaker 3>Philip Gibbs who writes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quote,</v>

3821
03:41:34.620 --> 03:41:39.620
<v Speaker 3>talking about the French infantry here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gibb's talks about how the French were </v>

3822
03:41:39.620 --> 03:41:42.330
<v Speaker 3>lured into the lightly defended first </v>
<v Speaker 3>zone only to be attacked by the Germans.</v>

3823
03:41:42.331 --> 03:41:43.920
<v Speaker 3>In the second zone of defense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he writes,</v>

3824
03:41:43.921 --> 03:41:48.921
<v Speaker 3>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were to be allowed an easy walk </v>

3825
03:41:48.921 --> 03:41:49.920
<v Speaker 3>through to their death trap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is what happened.</v>

3826
03:41:50.160 --> 03:41:55.160
<v Speaker 3>The French infantry advancing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>masses of black troops in the colonial </v>

3827
03:41:55.160 --> 03:41:59.541
<v Speaker 3>corps in the frontline of assault,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all exultant in inspired by a belief in </v>

3828
03:41:59.541 --> 03:42:03.831
<v Speaker 3>victory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>swept through the forward zone of the </v>

3829
03:42:03.831 --> 03:42:06.291
<v Speaker 3>German defenses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>astonished and then disconcerted by the </v>

3830
03:42:06.291 --> 03:42:09.951
<v Speaker 3>scarcity of Germans until an </v>
<v Speaker 3>annihilating barrage fire dropped upon </v>

3831
03:42:09.951 --> 03:42:13.590
<v Speaker 3>them and smash their human waves from </v>
<v Speaker 3>French officers and nurses.</v>

3832
03:42:13.591 --> 03:42:18.591
<v Speaker 3>I heard appalling tails of this tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The death wail of the black troops froze</v>

3833
03:42:18.931 --> 03:42:23.931
<v Speaker 3>the blood of the freshmen with horror.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their own losses were immense in a </v>

3834
03:42:23.931 --> 03:42:27.861
<v Speaker 3>bloody shambles and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the French colonial soldiers which had </v>

3835
03:42:29.411 --> 03:42:34.411
<v Speaker 3>been thrown into this disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ran screaming back towards their own </v>

3836
03:42:34.861 --> 03:42:38.850
<v Speaker 3>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yelling piece down with the war,</v>

3837
03:42:39.030 --> 03:42:44.030
<v Speaker 3>death to those who are responsible and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden the French army began to</v>

3838
03:42:47.121 --> 03:42:47.810
<v Speaker 3>collapse.</v>

3839
03:42:49.980 --> 03:42:53.400
<v Speaker 3>Traditionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the novel offensive is seen as the straw</v>

3840
03:42:53.401 --> 03:42:55.890
<v Speaker 3>that breaks the camel's back for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>French military.</v>

3841
03:42:56.700 --> 03:43:01.700
<v Speaker 3>And it's ironic that it would be that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way because if it's just judged in </v>

3842
03:43:01.700 --> 03:43:01.700
<v Speaker 3>relation to all the other French </v>
<v Speaker 3>battles,</v>

3843
03:43:01.700 --> 03:43:03.270
<v Speaker 3>the novella,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fancy is not terrible.</v>

3844
03:43:04.200 --> 03:43:07.890
<v Speaker 3>The casualty bill is horrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but pretty normal for these big battles.</v>

3845
03:43:07.891 --> 03:43:10.410
<v Speaker 3>And remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people being killed every day on</v>

3846
03:43:10.500 --> 03:43:14.460
<v Speaker 3>so called quiet fronts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the British casualties every week</v>

3847
03:43:14.461 --> 03:43:19.461
<v Speaker 3>to what they call wastage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just living on the western front with </v>

3848
03:43:19.461 --> 03:43:21.420
<v Speaker 3>snipers and bombs and trench raids and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that is 5,000</v>

3849
03:43:21.421 --> 03:43:24.750
<v Speaker 3>people a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I mean even between the big battles,</v>

3850
03:43:24.751 --> 03:43:26.070
<v Speaker 3>it's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in the big battles,</v>

3851
03:43:26.071 --> 03:43:28.470
<v Speaker 3>the numbers are astronomical by that </v>
<v Speaker 3>standard.</v>

3852
03:43:28.471 --> 03:43:30.600
<v Speaker 3>The novella fence is not that bad and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they did gain,</v>

3853
03:43:30.840 --> 03:43:35.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pretty decent amount of ground level </v>

3854
03:43:35.840 --> 03:43:37.610
<v Speaker 3>three miles in some places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this was sold in a completely </v>

3855
03:43:37.621 --> 03:43:38.610
<v Speaker 3>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The salesmen,</v>

3856
03:43:38.611 --> 03:43:43.611
<v Speaker 3>Robert Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sold this as the thunderbolt that wins </v>

3857
03:43:43.611 --> 03:43:46.371
<v Speaker 3>the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's got to have this last push </v>

3858
03:43:46.371 --> 03:43:48.690
<v Speaker 3>of optimism and and strength and </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources and gumption to end the war.</v>

3859
03:43:48.691 --> 03:43:53.691
<v Speaker 3>And then we can all go home and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sufferings over and a lot of people </v>

3860
03:43:53.691 --> 03:43:56.160
<v Speaker 3>drank the Koolaid and the crash after </v>
<v Speaker 3>they drank the Koolaid was worse than if</v>

3861
03:43:56.161 --> 03:43:58.350
<v Speaker 3>they'd never had the Koolaid at all.</v>

3862
03:44:00.860 --> 03:44:05.860
<v Speaker 3>All that optimism boomeranged back on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nevada who started to try to recast the </v>

3863
03:44:06.591 --> 03:44:09.200
<v Speaker 3>marketing just 24 hours into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>conflict.</v>

3864
03:44:09.201 --> 03:44:11.720
<v Speaker 3>He was no longer talking about war </v>
<v Speaker 3>winning thunderbolts.</v>

3865
03:44:11.721 --> 03:44:12.560
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3866
03:44:12.561 --> 03:44:17.561
<v Speaker 3>it's going very well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>modest gains in the sector in this </v>

3867
03:44:17.561 --> 03:44:20.341
<v Speaker 3>sector,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and no one was buying the recrafting of </v>

3868
03:44:20.341 --> 03:44:22.691
<v Speaker 3>the marketing strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The French government now has a </v>

3869
03:44:22.691 --> 03:44:27.611
<v Speaker 3>wonderful little drama on its hands </v>
<v Speaker 3>where it tries to get rid of Nevada and </v>

3870
03:44:27.611 --> 03:44:30.941
<v Speaker 3>he won't go quietly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put pitocin who's very competent.</v>

3871
03:44:31.470 --> 03:44:34.140
<v Speaker 3>We talked about him earlier in novels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old job,</v>

3872
03:44:34.141 --> 03:44:39.141
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a face off and you see this </v>

3873
03:44:39.141 --> 03:44:39.330
<v Speaker 3>wonderful again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>changing the guard between politicians,</v>

3874
03:44:39.331 --> 03:44:44.331
<v Speaker 3>kind of trying to assert their authority</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the generals and this push and tug </v>

3875
03:44:44.331 --> 03:44:46.080
<v Speaker 3>on who's going to be the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 3>authority.</v>

3876
03:44:48.260 --> 03:44:51.650
<v Speaker 3>The one thing that the politicians have </v>
<v Speaker 3>in their favor is that they're concerned</v>

3877
03:44:51.651 --> 03:44:55.940
<v Speaker 3>about casualties and the generals appear</v>
<v Speaker 3>to not be concerned about casualties and</v>

3878
03:44:55.941 --> 03:45:00.941
<v Speaker 3>the people who are rising up in French </v>
<v Speaker 3>units up and down the western front are </v>

3879
03:45:00.941 --> 03:45:05.381
<v Speaker 3>very concerned about casualties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The novella offensive traditionally is </v>

3880
03:45:08.031 --> 03:45:10.460
<v Speaker 3>what kicks off what are called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 19,</v>

3881
03:45:10.461 --> 03:45:15.461
<v Speaker 3>17 mutinies or the mutinies of 1917.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird term and it makes it </v>

3882
03:45:15.461 --> 03:45:17.060
<v Speaker 3>sound like one unit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rebels,</v>

3883
03:45:17.061 --> 03:45:22.061
<v Speaker 3>and then the rebellion know transfers </v>
<v Speaker 3>like wildfire up and down the front end </v>

3884
03:45:22.061 --> 03:45:22.940
<v Speaker 3>and all these units are acting </v>
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously.</v>

3885
03:45:22.941 --> 03:45:25.340
<v Speaker 3>If that had happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the war would've been over for France.</v>

3886
03:45:27.290 --> 03:45:32.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do to stop a rebellion or </v>

3887
03:45:32.290 --> 03:45:32.320
<v Speaker 3>when it's the army that's rebelling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that had happened,</v>

3888
03:45:32.321 --> 03:45:37.321
<v Speaker 3>it would've been all over and the French</v>
<v Speaker 3>government knew it and acted </v>

3889
03:45:37.321 --> 03:45:37.321
<v Speaker 3>accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead,</v>

3890
03:45:37.321 --> 03:45:40.690
<v Speaker 3>you have to imagine a burning roof with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the is everywhere,</v>

3891
03:45:40.810 --> 03:45:45.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going off into the wind and landing all </v>

3892
03:45:45.810 --> 03:45:45.850
<v Speaker 3>over the dry grass on the lawn and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3893
03:45:45.851 --> 03:45:49.840
<v Speaker 3>the French government is running around </v>
<v Speaker 3>stamping out fires as they catch hold as</v>

3894
03:45:49.841 --> 03:45:54.070
<v Speaker 3>many as six of these units a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're involved in,</v>

3895
03:45:54.130 --> 03:45:59.130
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the French called acts of </v>

3896
03:45:59.130 --> 03:46:01.291
<v Speaker 3>collective and discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which meant a whole wide range of </v>

3897
03:46:01.291 --> 03:46:03.961
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it meant getting drunk as an </v>

3898
03:46:03.961 --> 03:46:03.961
<v Speaker 3>entire unit and that was the end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3899
03:46:03.961 --> 03:46:05.740
<v Speaker 3>We're not going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other Times they just refuse to go up to</v>

3900
03:46:05.741 --> 03:46:09.580
<v Speaker 3>the front.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One forest decided to march on Paris and</v>

3901
03:46:09.581 --> 03:46:11.110
<v Speaker 3>was talked out of that at the last </v>
<v Speaker 3>minute,</v>

3902
03:46:12.940 --> 03:46:17.940
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of this was tied to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russian revolution going on </v>

3903
03:46:17.940 --> 03:46:22.861
<v Speaker 3>simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The French in the field saw that all of </v>

3904
03:46:22.861 --> 03:46:25.570
<v Speaker 3>a sudden Russian soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we're going to get out of fighting</v>

3905
03:46:25.571 --> 03:46:30.571
<v Speaker 3>this work as they'd somehow with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people acted together to go after the </v>

3906
03:46:30.571 --> 03:46:32.620
<v Speaker 3>people that were as Louis Bar Toast </v>
<v Speaker 3>explained it,</v>

3907
03:46:32.710 --> 03:46:33.610
<v Speaker 3>enslaving them,</v>

3908
03:46:34.690 --> 03:46:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Louis Bartos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who a socialist and who would have </v>

3909
03:46:39.690 --> 03:46:41.941
<v Speaker 3>viewed these happenings in Petrograd in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia with great enthusiasm,</v>

3910
03:46:43.750 --> 03:46:48.750
<v Speaker 3>wrote this right around the times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The outbreaks of collective in </v>

3911
03:46:48.891 --> 03:46:51.310
<v Speaker 3>discipline are happening in his army.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quote,</v>

3912
03:46:52.940 --> 03:46:55.280
<v Speaker 3>at this time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Russian revolution broke out.</v>

3913
03:46:55.580 --> 03:47:00.580
<v Speaker 3>Those Slavic soldiers only yesterday and</v>
<v Speaker 3>slaved and bent double under the weight </v>

3914
03:47:00.580 --> 03:47:03.250
<v Speaker 3>of iron discipline unknowingly marched </v>
<v Speaker 3>off to mass,</v>

3915
03:47:03.251 --> 03:47:06.740
<v Speaker 3>occurs like resigned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slaves had thrown off their yolks,</v>

3916
03:47:06.920 --> 03:47:10.430
<v Speaker 3>proclaim their liberty and imposed piece</v>
<v Speaker 3>on their masters.</v>

3917
03:47:10.431 --> 03:47:15.431
<v Speaker 3>Their hangman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole world was stupefied petrified </v>

3918
03:47:15.431 --> 03:47:19.181
<v Speaker 3>by this revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this collapse of the immense empire of </v>

3919
03:47:19.181 --> 03:47:22.331
<v Speaker 3>the czars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These events had repercussions on the </v>

3920
03:47:22.331 --> 03:47:22.400
<v Speaker 3>western front and throughout the French </v>
<v Speaker 3>ranks.</v>

3921
03:47:22.610 --> 03:47:27.020
<v Speaker 3>A wind of revolt blew across almost all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the regiments and quote,</v>

3922
03:47:28.580 --> 03:47:31.010
<v Speaker 3>but as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an uneven sort of an affair.</v>

3923
03:47:31.310 --> 03:47:34.970
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it involved whole units,</v>
<v Speaker 3>large numbers of troops.</v>

3924
03:47:34.971 --> 03:47:39.971
<v Speaker 3>Other Times it was a decision made by </v>
<v Speaker 3>single individuals alone that they just </v>

3925
03:47:39.971 --> 03:47:43.250
<v Speaker 3>weren't going to have their lives thrown</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a meat grinder anymore.</v>

3926
03:47:43.251 --> 03:47:48.251
<v Speaker 3>Historian Eric Dorm Bros tries to give </v>
<v Speaker 3>you a sense of the feeling when he </v>

3927
03:47:48.251 --> 03:47:48.251
<v Speaker 3>writes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quote</v>

3928
03:47:48.600 --> 03:47:50.930
<v Speaker 3>already on day two of the novel </v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive.</v>

3929
03:47:51.080 --> 03:47:55.160
<v Speaker 3>17 soldiers have one regiment left their</v>
<v Speaker 3>post and went to the rear,</v>

3930
03:47:55.250 --> 03:47:58.370
<v Speaker 3>and then in May 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>infantry men abandoned the line.</v>

3931
03:47:58.730 --> 03:48:03.730
<v Speaker 3>A junior officer recorded the scene at </v>
<v Speaker 3>one train station receiving men who'd </v>

3932
03:48:03.730 --> 03:48:07.570
<v Speaker 3>been rotated out of the line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now Bros is quoting and eye witness and </v>

3933
03:48:07.570 --> 03:48:12.161
<v Speaker 3>the eyewitness to the troops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting away from the front during this </v>

3934
03:48:12.161 --> 03:48:12.380
<v Speaker 3>rebellious time says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quote,</v>

3935
03:48:12.800 --> 03:48:16.790
<v Speaker 3>as soon as the train enters with what </v>
<v Speaker 3>you would say a horde of savages,</v>

3936
03:48:16.970 --> 03:48:21.200
<v Speaker 3>all the doors open on both sides and men</v>
<v Speaker 3>flood out on the platforms,</v>

3937
03:48:21.290 --> 03:48:26.290
<v Speaker 3>shouts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>insults and threats flying all </v>

3938
03:48:26.290 --> 03:48:26.510
<v Speaker 3>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>death to the sugars at home,</v>

3939
03:48:26.600 --> 03:48:27.830
<v Speaker 3>murderers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pigs,</v>

3940
03:48:27.831 --> 03:48:28.010
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

3941
03:48:28.010 --> 03:48:31.490
<v Speaker 1>they are long lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the revolution down with the war.</v>

3942
03:48:31.550 --> 03:48:33.560
<v Speaker 1>It's peace we want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

3943
03:48:34.390 --> 03:48:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bros picks up the narrative,</v>

3944
03:48:35.771 --> 03:48:40.771
<v Speaker 1>quote the troubles spread the 68 of 112 </v>
<v Speaker 1>divisions in the French army in June.</v>

3945
03:48:41.650 --> 03:48:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Each reporting one to five mutinous </v>
<v Speaker 1>incidents,</v>

3946
03:48:44.171 --> 03:48:49.171
<v Speaker 1>but no killing of officers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rank and file demanded an end to </v>

3947
03:48:49.171 --> 03:48:53.070
<v Speaker 1>further attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better pay and living conditions and </v>

3948
03:48:53.070 --> 03:48:56.371
<v Speaker 1>more furloughs and quote John Keegan and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of other historians have an </v>

3949
03:48:57.671 --> 03:49:02.671
<v Speaker 1>interesting way of describing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This act of rebellion that was breaking </v>

3950
03:49:02.891 --> 03:49:07.891
<v Speaker 1>out almost spontaneously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although influenced by other breakouts </v>

3951
03:49:07.891 --> 03:49:08.140
<v Speaker 1>all across and up and down the western </v>
<v Speaker 1>front.</v>

3952
03:49:08.410 --> 03:49:10.270
<v Speaker 1>He says it's like a labor strike.</v>

3953
03:49:11.020 --> 03:49:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Like the soldiers had just decided that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't going to do certain things </v>

3954
03:49:16.020 --> 03:49:18.220
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said it wasn't defeatism.</v>

3955
03:49:18.280 --> 03:49:23.280
<v Speaker 1>It was defensive ism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that these soldiers were not </v>

3956
03:49:23.280 --> 03:49:23.710
<v Speaker 1>gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let the Germans come and invade France.</v>

3957
03:49:23.711 --> 03:49:26.890
<v Speaker 1>They weren't going to abandon the line </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they wouldn't stop fighting,</v>

3958
03:49:26.891 --> 03:49:31.540
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't going to be involved in</v>
<v Speaker 1>any more of these offensives were 130,</v>

3959
03:49:31.541 --> 03:49:33.610
<v Speaker 1>a hundred 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred 50,000</v>

3960
03:49:33.611 --> 03:49:36.700
<v Speaker 1>of them were going to become casualties </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a hopeless cause.</v>

3961
03:49:37.320 --> 03:49:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Let's also remember that it didn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this point until the French army had </v>

3962
03:49:42.320 --> 03:49:46.611
<v Speaker 1>suffered in three and a half years about</v>
<v Speaker 1>as many killed as the United States has </v>

3963
03:49:46.651 --> 03:49:51.651
<v Speaker 1>suffered in all its wars put together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would the United States today,</v>

3964
03:49:52.460 --> 03:49:55.130
<v Speaker 1>a nation of 300 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

3965
03:49:55.131 --> 03:50:00.131
<v Speaker 1>had about 39 or 40 deal with one point </v>
<v Speaker 1>five or one point 7 million dead in four</v>

3966
03:50:01.431 --> 03:50:04.950
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You adjusted for population size,</v>

3967
03:50:04.951 --> 03:50:07.140
<v Speaker 1>that'd be more like seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven and a half million,</v>

3968
03:50:07.141 --> 03:50:09.630
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine?</v>

3969
03:50:10.870 --> 03:50:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Would you expect us to be hangover free </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of the century in terms of </v>

3970
03:50:15.971 --> 03:50:20.971
<v Speaker 1>military affairs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The French had some lingering damage </v>

3971
03:50:20.971 --> 03:50:22.720
<v Speaker 1>because of this first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone else would.</v>

3972
03:50:22.750 --> 03:50:25.540
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got back on their feet at all.</v>

3973
03:50:25.780 --> 03:50:30.780
<v Speaker 1>It's also sort of a wonder for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>allied cause that the Germans are </v>

3974
03:50:30.780 --> 03:50:31.560
<v Speaker 1>unaware of this somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

3975
03:50:31.610 --> 03:50:36.610
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the novel offensive that </v>

3976
03:50:36.610 --> 03:50:36.610
<v Speaker 1>everybody in Germany is talking about on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the streets.</v>

3977
03:50:36.610 --> 03:50:40.591
<v Speaker 1>It's so well known and yet the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>Army starts falling apart and rebelling </v>

3978
03:50:40.591 --> 03:50:40.810
<v Speaker 1>and the Germans don't know.</v>

3979
03:50:42.620 --> 03:50:45.530
<v Speaker 1>If you're the French high command and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you got your army,</v>

3980
03:50:45.880 --> 03:50:50.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to catch fire like a bunch of </v>

3981
03:50:50.880 --> 03:50:51.710
<v Speaker 1>rooftop ambers that are falling on dry </v>
<v Speaker 1>grass.</v>

3982
03:50:51.711 --> 03:50:54.380
<v Speaker 1>What do you do to stop that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to be very careful,</v>

3983
03:50:54.381 --> 03:50:56.180
<v Speaker 1>don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you give up too much,</v>

3984
03:50:56.181 --> 03:51:01.181
<v Speaker 1>it becomes like what the Russians are </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with where you can't even have </v>

3985
03:51:01.181 --> 03:51:04.061
<v Speaker 1>the troops in order to run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they start electing their own </v>

3986
03:51:04.061 --> 03:51:04.820
<v Speaker 1>little governing groups and they do what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want.</v>

3987
03:51:04.880 --> 03:51:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Can't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you crack down and get all tough </v>

3988
03:51:09.880 --> 03:51:09.880
<v Speaker 1>on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might spread the revolution.</v>

3989
03:51:09.880 --> 03:51:14.330
<v Speaker 1>It's a deft and terrible tight rope for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the French government to walk.</v>

3990
03:51:15.140 --> 03:51:20.140
<v Speaker 1>This new military leader that takes over</v>
<v Speaker 1>for novell Patala is considered to be </v>

3991
03:51:20.140 --> 03:51:23.411
<v Speaker 1>sort of a soldier's general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that helps and he'll famously go </v>

3992
03:51:23.411 --> 03:51:26.351
<v Speaker 1>around to all these units speaking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and actually promising and </v>

3993
03:51:26.351 --> 03:51:26.351
<v Speaker 1>delivering some of</v>

3994
03:51:26.351 --> 03:51:28.110
<v Speaker 3>the reforms they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

3995
03:51:28.111 --> 03:51:30.600
<v Speaker 3>reforms on home leave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>

3996
03:51:30.601 --> 03:51:32.100
<v Speaker 3>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a bunch of things that he</v>

3997
03:51:32.101 --> 03:51:35.190
<v Speaker 3>can manage to perk up and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and take care of that help the troops,</v>

3998
03:51:35.640 --> 03:51:36.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>griping on the front.</v>

3999
03:51:37.200 --> 03:51:40.230
<v Speaker 3>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has to show who's still in charge.</v>

4000
03:51:40.231 --> 03:51:42.600
<v Speaker 3>This is still a military.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Laws are broken.</v>

4001
03:51:43.080 --> 03:51:47.130
<v Speaker 3>Discipline must be maintained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The French start a crackdown in July.</v>

4002
03:51:47.131 --> 03:51:50.670
<v Speaker 3>In 1917,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will court marshal almost 24,000</v>

4003
03:51:50.671 --> 03:51:55.671
<v Speaker 3>soldiers for collective indiscipline </v>
<v Speaker 3>delish issue about 500 death sentences.</v>

4004
03:51:57.040 --> 03:51:59.680
<v Speaker 3>They will actually carry out less than </v>
<v Speaker 3>100 of them,</v>

4005
03:52:00.910 --> 03:52:02.860
<v Speaker 3>but there's one thing pitocin can </v>
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>

4006
03:52:03.100 --> 03:52:08.100
<v Speaker 3>He cannot make this army capable or </v>
<v Speaker 3>willing or trustworthy to go on another </v>

4007
03:52:08.261 --> 03:52:11.140
<v Speaker 3>major offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an army that has to regroup,</v>

4008
03:52:11.350 --> 03:52:16.350
<v Speaker 3>be rebuilt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Refortified in Bhutan is going to do a </v>

4009
03:52:16.350 --> 03:52:18.901
<v Speaker 3>historically famous job of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to take time and in the </v>

4010
03:52:18.901 --> 03:52:21.841
<v Speaker 3>meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number one thing that he gives to </v>

4011
03:52:21.841 --> 03:52:22.720
<v Speaker 3>his troops that they were asking for </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he's got no choice,</v>

4012
03:52:23.020 --> 03:52:25.900
<v Speaker 3>is that they're not going to be thrown </v>
<v Speaker 3>into murderous,</v>

4013
03:52:25.960 --> 03:52:28.660
<v Speaker 3>hopeless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>offensives anytime soon.</v>

4014
03:52:29.380 --> 03:52:34.380
<v Speaker 3>This leaves the western front in any </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of offensive activity on it for the</v>

4015
03:52:34.751 --> 03:52:37.990
<v Speaker 3>rest of 1917 to the British alone,</v>

4016
03:52:39.180 --> 03:52:44.180
<v Speaker 3>the British commander Douglas Haig is </v>
<v Speaker 3>fine with that because he has a plan and</v>

4017
03:52:44.901 --> 03:52:49.901
<v Speaker 3>he's wanting to carry it out for some </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and now that the French are not in </v>

4018
03:52:49.901 --> 03:52:53.141
<v Speaker 3>his way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he casts his covetous I on Oprah and the</v>

4019
03:52:54.811 --> 03:52:57.150
<v Speaker 3>Belgian ports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet again,</v>

4020
03:52:59.610 --> 03:53:02.670
<v Speaker 3>Douglas Haig,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the British military leader launched the</v>

4021
03:53:02.671 --> 03:53:07.671
<v Speaker 3>British to launch an attack on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>German defenses in Belgium at Ipa where </v>

4022
03:53:08.041 --> 03:53:11.220
<v Speaker 3>there's already been two battles of Epri</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this war already.</v>

4023
03:53:12.930 --> 03:53:15.540
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hague's got a great army to do this with</v>

4024
03:53:15.690 --> 03:53:19.290
<v Speaker 3>the British army in late 1917.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mid 1917.</v>

4025
03:53:19.320 --> 03:53:21.960
<v Speaker 3>Is is maybe the best army in the war at </v>
<v Speaker 3>this time.</v>

4026
03:53:21.961 --> 03:53:24.090
<v Speaker 3>It's taken years for the British.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4027
03:53:24.091 --> 03:53:26.430
<v Speaker 3>traditionally a sea power to build up a </v>
<v Speaker 3>land power,</v>

4028
03:53:26.820 --> 03:53:28.230
<v Speaker 3>but by July,</v>
<v Speaker 3>August,</v>

4029
03:53:28.231 --> 03:53:29.100
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>17,</v>

4030
03:53:29.101 --> 03:53:34.101
<v Speaker 3>they've done a great job of doing just </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and it's millions strong in the </v>

4031
03:53:34.101 --> 03:53:38.691
<v Speaker 3>British,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a boutique army when this war </v>

4032
03:53:38.691 --> 03:53:38.691
<v Speaker 3>started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

4033
03:53:38.691 --> 03:53:39.000
<v Speaker 3>very fine and professional and </v>
<v Speaker 3>volunteers,</v>

4034
03:53:39.001 --> 03:53:40.830
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a boutique army.</v>

4035
03:53:41.130 --> 03:53:45.590
<v Speaker 3>What they have in 1917 are a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly conscripts,</v>

4036
03:53:45.600 --> 03:53:47.190
<v Speaker 3>some volunteers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but mostly conscripts.</v>

4037
03:53:47.191 --> 03:53:50.130
<v Speaker 3>They don't sing on their way to and from</v>
<v Speaker 3>battle anymore.</v>

4038
03:53:50.131 --> 03:53:52.500
<v Speaker 3>Like in 1914 after the psalm that all </v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped.</v>

4039
03:53:52.501 --> 03:53:57.501
<v Speaker 3>These are a bunch of grim professionals </v>
<v Speaker 3>who operate with deadly efficiency and </v>

4040
03:53:59.521 --> 03:54:00.900
<v Speaker 3>have a sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

4041
03:54:01.040 --> 03:54:06.040
<v Speaker 3>a morale that's hard to describe it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they suffered a terrible ordeal the year</v>

4042
03:54:06.331 --> 03:54:08.160
<v Speaker 3>before at the battle of the somme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrible.</v>

4043
03:54:08.190 --> 03:54:13.190
<v Speaker 3>Lost a lot of fantastic people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but came back with even more artillery </v>

4044
03:54:13.190 --> 03:54:16.941
<v Speaker 3>pieces here in 1917.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a great tool in the hands of Haig </v>

4045
03:54:16.941 --> 03:54:18.240
<v Speaker 3>and hade wants to use it in Belgium </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the Germans.</v>

4046
03:54:19.610 --> 03:54:21.830
<v Speaker 3>But there are people that think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a stupid idea.</v>

4047
03:54:22.520 --> 03:54:24.040
<v Speaker 3>And after several years of</v>

4048
03:54:24.040 --> 03:54:25.540
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you've watched,</v>

4049
03:54:25.940 --> 03:54:30.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing happen over and over </v>

4050
03:54:30.940 --> 03:54:33.301
<v Speaker 1>again in all these battles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people that are going to push </v>

4051
03:54:33.301 --> 03:54:35.751
<v Speaker 1>back and you're starting to see some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these political leaders start to </v>

4052
03:54:35.751 --> 03:54:36.550
<v Speaker 1>question what the military is doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>openly to their face.</v>

4053
03:54:36.820 --> 03:54:38.650
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we mentioned this earlier,</v>

4054
03:54:38.651 --> 03:54:40.720
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to insinuate that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>never happens.</v>

4055
03:54:40.721 --> 03:54:45.721
<v Speaker 1>I mean Abraham Lincoln for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>famously would argue with the civil war </v>

4056
03:54:45.721 --> 03:54:47.470
<v Speaker 1>generals and they would resent it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in some countries like Germany,</v>

4057
03:54:47.950 --> 03:54:52.950
<v Speaker 1>politicians in Germany do not interfere </v>
<v Speaker 1>in military strategy and they'd only </v>

4058
03:54:53.530 --> 03:54:57.970
<v Speaker 1>just started doing that in France with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the collapse of the Novella offensive,</v>

4059
03:54:58.000 --> 03:55:03.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the novella offensive that sort </v>

4060
03:55:03.000 --> 03:55:04.591
<v Speaker 1>of brought them into saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you sure we want to do something </v>

4061
03:55:04.591 --> 03:55:05.980
<v Speaker 1>like this again in Britain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4062
03:55:05.981 --> 03:55:07.870
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think as a modern person reading</v>

4063
03:55:07.871 --> 03:55:09.460
<v Speaker 1>the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think many of you probably thought</v>

4064
03:55:09.461 --> 03:55:11.680
<v Speaker 1>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wondering why it took this long.</v>

4065
03:55:11.681 --> 03:55:16.681
<v Speaker 1>How many times can you lose hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people in what appeared to </v>

4066
03:55:16.681 --> 03:55:19.510
<v Speaker 1>the nonmilitary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I to be very similar kinds of attacks.</v>

4067
03:55:19.870 --> 03:55:24.870
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a little strange if there </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't more people questioning this in </v>

4068
03:55:24.870 --> 03:55:28.201
<v Speaker 1>Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are led by the Prime Minister </v>

4069
03:55:28.201 --> 03:55:28.201
<v Speaker 1>Lloyd George.</v>

4070
03:55:28.770 --> 03:55:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Now George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be fair is viewed by history very </v>

4071
03:55:33.770 --> 03:55:37.041
<v Speaker 1>similarly to the way woodrow Wilson is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as though there's a good </v>

4072
03:55:37.041 --> 03:55:38.520
<v Speaker 1>lawyer George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's an evil Lloyd George and you</v>

4073
03:55:38.521 --> 03:55:40.770
<v Speaker 1>know different histories will portray </v>
<v Speaker 1>him differently,</v>

4074
03:55:41.070 --> 03:55:46.070
<v Speaker 1>but taken at face value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lloyd George presents himself as the </v>

4075
03:55:46.081 --> 03:55:50.310
<v Speaker 1>person who defends the soldiers from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>generals.</v>

4076
03:55:51.180 --> 03:55:56.180
<v Speaker 1>He says during this whole lead in to </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not hey gets to have his </v>

4077
03:55:56.180 --> 03:55:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Belgian offensive quote.</v>

4078
03:55:58.910 --> 03:56:03.910
<v Speaker 3>The cabinet must regard themselves as </v>
<v Speaker 3>trustees for the fine fellows that </v>

4079
03:56:03.910 --> 03:56:08.111
<v Speaker 3>constitute our army.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're willing to face any dangers and </v>

4080
03:56:08.111 --> 03:56:11.651
<v Speaker 3>they do so without complaint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they trusted the leaders of the </v>

4081
03:56:11.651 --> 03:56:14.711
<v Speaker 3>nation to see that their lives are not </v>
<v Speaker 3>needlessly thrown away and that they're </v>

4082
03:56:14.711 --> 03:56:18.650
<v Speaker 3>not sacrificed on mere gambles which are</v>
<v Speaker 3>resorted to merely because those who are</v>

4083
03:56:18.651 --> 03:56:23.651
<v Speaker 3>directing the war can think of nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>better to do with the men under their </v>

4084
03:56:23.651 --> 03:56:27.221
<v Speaker 3>command.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is therefore imperative that before </v>

4085
03:56:27.221 --> 03:56:30.191
<v Speaker 3>we embark upon a gigantic attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which must necessarily entail the loss </v>

4086
03:56:30.191 --> 03:56:34.460
<v Speaker 3>of scores of thousands of valuable lives</v>
<v Speaker 3>and produce that sense of discouragement</v>

4087
03:56:34.670 --> 03:56:37.820
<v Speaker 3>which might very well rush nations into </v>
<v Speaker 3>premature piece,</v>

4088
03:56:38.090 --> 03:56:43.090
<v Speaker 3>that we should feel a fair confidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>that such an attack as a reasonable </v>

4089
03:56:43.090 --> 03:56:45.060
<v Speaker 3>chance of succeeding Amir gamble would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be both</v>

4090
03:56:45.200 --> 03:56:48.140
<v Speaker 1>folly and a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to quote,</v>

4091
03:56:49.590 --> 03:56:54.590
<v Speaker 1>I must confess that to the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>observer having just witnessed the </v>

4092
03:56:54.590 --> 03:56:58.461
<v Speaker 1>several years previous of this war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think to yourself when you hear </v>

4093
03:56:58.461 --> 03:56:59.880
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about damn time,</v>

4094
03:57:01.820 --> 03:57:06.820
<v Speaker 1>but many modern historians wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wonder if Haig didn't have a pretty</v>

4095
03:57:07.371 --> 03:57:10.880
<v Speaker 1>good feel for this thing and that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>

4096
03:57:10.881 --> 03:57:14.240
<v Speaker 1>we're barking up the wrong tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe for their own political purposes.</v>

4097
03:57:15.160 --> 03:57:20.160
<v Speaker 1>Haig sure makes it look like Lloyd </v>
<v Speaker 1>George doesn't know what he's talking </v>

4098
03:57:20.160 --> 03:57:22.400
<v Speaker 1>about when he opens an operation</v>

4099
03:57:22.700 --> 03:57:24.290
<v Speaker 3>on June seventh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>

4100
03:57:24.291 --> 03:57:29.291
<v Speaker 3>17.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To take this high ground that he needs </v>

4101
03:57:29.291 --> 03:57:30.230
<v Speaker 3>to take before he can have his IEP or </v>
<v Speaker 3>battle.</v>

4102
03:57:30.470 --> 03:57:35.330
<v Speaker 3>It's called Misener Ridge and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>British had since 1915.</v>

4103
03:57:35.660 --> 03:57:40.660
<v Speaker 3>Been tunneling under this eight miles of</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridge lines and planting explosives </v>

4104
03:57:41.421 --> 03:57:46.180
<v Speaker 3>underneath the incredibly deep and </v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated German defenses up there.</v>

4105
03:57:46.190 --> 03:57:51.190
<v Speaker 3>They were impenetrable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the British went underneath them and </v>

4106
03:57:51.190 --> 03:57:52.310
<v Speaker 3>the Germans knew they were doing some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this because they found one of them,</v>

4107
03:57:52.760 --> 03:57:54.380
<v Speaker 3>but on June seventh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>

4108
03:57:54.390 --> 03:57:57.260
<v Speaker 3>17 when he decides he's going to take </v>
<v Speaker 3>this high ground,</v>

4109
03:57:57.440 --> 03:58:02.440
<v Speaker 3>he starts off his attack by blowing up </v>
<v Speaker 3>that eight miles of ridge lines with </v>

4110
03:58:03.171 --> 03:58:08.171
<v Speaker 3>these munitions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's more than a million pounds of </v>

4111
03:58:08.171 --> 03:58:11.321
<v Speaker 3>explosives underneath those hills and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they blow up all within 28 seconds </v>

4112
03:58:11.321 --> 03:58:14.960
<v Speaker 3>of each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>supposedly you could hear it in London.</v>

4113
03:58:15.560 --> 03:58:18.680
<v Speaker 3>I've heard some people say it was heard </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Ireland.</v>

4114
03:58:19.160 --> 03:58:24.160
<v Speaker 3>It's thought to be the biggest manmade </v>
<v Speaker 3>explosion before nuclear weapons or </v>

4115
03:58:24.160 --> 03:58:27.530
<v Speaker 3>atomic weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it vaporizes 10,000</v>

4116
03:58:27.531 --> 03:58:28.640
<v Speaker 3>Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instantly.</v>

4117
03:58:30.930 --> 03:58:35.930
<v Speaker 3>The second those minds are blown up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thousands of British artillery pieces on</v>

4118
03:58:36.391 --> 03:58:41.391
<v Speaker 3>the horizon open fire on this same line </v>
<v Speaker 3>of ridges and the British,</v>

4119
03:58:42.450 --> 03:58:47.450
<v Speaker 3>80,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them who come out of their trenches </v>

4120
03:58:47.450 --> 03:58:49.641
<v Speaker 3>and and march toward that high ground </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a pretty darn easy time taking it </v>

4121
03:58:49.641 --> 03:58:52.770
<v Speaker 3>by first world war standards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to always throw that in because</v>

4122
03:58:53.010 --> 03:58:55.200
<v Speaker 3>to the naked eye it's still looks like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people died,</v>

4123
03:58:55.201 --> 03:59:00.201
<v Speaker 3>but by first world war standards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a pretty darn good attack and </v>

4124
03:59:00.201 --> 03:59:01.880
<v Speaker 3>once again it seems to show that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>British have found the secret sauce,</v>

4125
03:59:02.100 --> 03:59:04.710
<v Speaker 3>the magic formula of how the tanks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the artillery,</v>

4126
03:59:04.711 --> 03:59:09.711
<v Speaker 3>the aircraft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it all works together perfectly and </v>

4127
03:59:09.711 --> 03:59:11.571
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Messina Ridge taken for not that much </v>

4128
03:59:11.571 --> 03:59:12.060
<v Speaker 3>loss of life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seems like,</v>

4129
03:59:12.061 --> 03:59:13.290
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knows what he's doing,</v>

4130
03:59:13.440 --> 03:59:15.380
<v Speaker 3>but before he gets approval for this </v>
<v Speaker 3>battle,</v>

4131
03:59:15.390 --> 03:59:15.850
<v Speaker 3>it Breena.</v>

4132
03:59:15.880 --> 03:59:17.520
<v Speaker 3>He's pulling up the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's getting ready.</v>

4133
03:59:17.790 --> 03:59:22.790
<v Speaker 3>Lloyd George and company take him into a</v>
<v Speaker 3>back room and make him kind of do a </v>

4134
03:59:22.790 --> 03:59:26.391
<v Speaker 3>powerpoint presentation for Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Civilian leaders in Hague's sort of </v>

4135
03:59:26.391 --> 03:59:30.410
<v Speaker 3>grits his teeth and does it and explains</v>
<v Speaker 3>why it'll be a good thing and you know </v>

4136
03:59:30.410 --> 03:59:34.251
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why we should be doing this and why it </v>

4137
03:59:34.251 --> 03:59:36.351
<v Speaker 3>should be a walk over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that wonderful battle we </v>

4138
03:59:36.351 --> 03:59:38.571
<v Speaker 3>just fought and took Messina Ridge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Haig will end up getting other generals </v>

4139
03:59:38.571 --> 03:59:42.060
<v Speaker 3>and admirals to sort of side with him </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the political leadership.</v>

4140
03:59:42.300 --> 03:59:47.300
<v Speaker 3>There were always politicians who sided </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the military and thought they're </v>

4141
03:59:47.300 --> 03:59:48.030
<v Speaker 3>the professionals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You leave things to them.</v>

4142
03:59:48.210 --> 03:59:53.210
<v Speaker 3>For guys like Churchill or Lloyd George,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who were the ones questioning military </v>

4143
03:59:53.581 --> 03:59:55.290
<v Speaker 3>leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were in a very tough position.</v>

4144
03:59:55.291 --> 04:00:00.180
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine what risk they would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have run if they had overruled all their</v>

4145
04:00:00.181 --> 04:00:04.110
<v Speaker 3>military professionals and then 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys get killed in a battle,</v>

4146
04:00:04.860 --> 04:00:08.130
<v Speaker 3>which by the way is almost the default </v>
<v Speaker 3>result of a lot of these battles.</v>

4147
04:00:08.280 --> 04:00:13.280
<v Speaker 3>So you could pretty much be assured that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would happen if it happened to the </v>

4148
04:00:13.280 --> 04:00:13.280
<v Speaker 3>generals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4149
04:00:13.280 --> 04:00:15.030
<v Speaker 3>well it just happened again to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>generals.</v>

4150
04:00:15.300 --> 04:00:18.810
<v Speaker 3>But if Lloyd George overruled all their </v>
<v Speaker 3>generals and it happened because of him,</v>

4151
04:00:18.811 --> 04:00:20.070
<v Speaker 3>you be sure he</v>

4152
04:00:20.070 --> 04:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>would have been roasted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4153
04:00:23.370 --> 04:00:27.060
<v Speaker 1>so predictably I'm Douglas Haig gets his</v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive.</v>

4154
04:00:27.570 --> 04:00:32.570
<v Speaker 1>He starts by starting a military </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombardment of the area right around </v>

4155
04:00:32.570 --> 04:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>July 15th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>July 20th,</v>

4156
04:00:34.530 --> 04:00:39.530
<v Speaker 1>before the ground attack starts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British will shoot almost 4 million </v>

4157
04:00:39.540 --> 04:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>shells to just show you how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>progression is going.</v>

4158
04:00:42.120 --> 04:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>A year ago at the somme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were all saucer.</v>

4159
04:00:44.941 --> 04:00:49.941
<v Speaker 1>I'd and so was the rest of the world at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time when the British shot off a </v>

4160
04:00:49.941 --> 04:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>million shells before they started that </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle for this,</v>

4161
04:00:52.291 --> 04:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>when they're shooting off almost 4 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>

4162
04:00:54.151 --> 04:00:59.151
<v Speaker 1>You can see why Germany is concerned </v>
<v Speaker 1>with finding a way to turn their entire </v>

4163
04:00:59.641 --> 04:01:02.490
<v Speaker 1>country into a munitions factory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we said,</v>

4164
04:01:02.491 --> 04:01:07.491
<v Speaker 1>was the goal on July 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first 1917.</v>

4165
04:01:09.380 --> 04:01:14.350
<v Speaker 1>The IPA offensive starts very soon </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>

4166
04:01:15.300 --> 04:01:20.300
<v Speaker 1>so does the rain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be the rain that will give this </v>

4167
04:01:20.300 --> 04:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unique standout character</v>

4168
04:01:23.800 --> 04:01:27.130
<v Speaker 1>and there are so many battles in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war that sound the same,</v>

4169
04:01:27.430 --> 04:01:30.550
<v Speaker 1>that only a few stand out and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>always for some particular reason.</v>

4170
04:01:30.551 --> 04:01:32.560
<v Speaker 1>It become associated with something </v>
<v Speaker 1>special.</v>

4171
04:01:32.590 --> 04:01:37.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a horrific way the most casualties </v>

4172
04:01:37.590 --> 04:01:37.590
<v Speaker 1>are the most shells or the most this or </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

4173
04:01:37.590 --> 04:01:40.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean everyone knows Verdun is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great artillery meat grinder.</v>

4174
04:01:40.271 --> 04:01:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Somme is that horrible,</v>

4175
04:01:43.750 --> 04:01:48.490
<v Speaker 1>tragic situation with maybe tragic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence that Bruce will off offensive</v>

4176
04:01:48.491 --> 04:01:51.490
<v Speaker 1>in the east is known for its scope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Passion Dale,</v>

4177
04:01:51.580 --> 04:01:53.080
<v Speaker 1>which will be the British name for </v>
<v Speaker 1>third.</v>

4178
04:01:53.081 --> 04:01:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Ipa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is known for its mud</v>

4179
04:01:55.810 --> 04:01:58.030
<v Speaker 1>and mud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't sound like too terrible a thing,</v>

4180
04:01:58.031 --> 04:02:03.031
<v Speaker 1>but when you think about living outdoors</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fighting mud makes a terrible </v>

4181
04:02:03.031 --> 04:02:07.591
<v Speaker 1>situation worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to suggest that just </v>

4182
04:02:07.591 --> 04:02:10.321
<v Speaker 1>because this is probably the worst mud </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone has ever fought in in the first </v>

4183
04:02:10.321 --> 04:02:14.311
<v Speaker 1>world war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That mud has not been a problem for </v>

4184
04:02:14.311 --> 04:02:15.040
<v Speaker 1>soldiers on other fronts and another </v>
<v Speaker 1>battles.</v>

4185
04:02:15.280 --> 04:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>It's been sort of the bane of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence for people especially in </v>

4186
04:02:20.280 --> 04:02:24.031
<v Speaker 1>trenches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nowhere is the mod like it is in </v>

4187
04:02:24.031 --> 04:02:24.340
<v Speaker 1>flanders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The soldiers fighting in it described it</v>

4188
04:02:24.400 --> 04:02:27.370
<v Speaker 1>as having a consistency of porridge or </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheesecake.</v>

4189
04:02:28.300 --> 04:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>There is no bottom to it and you sink in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it slowly as you would in quicksand.</v>

4190
04:02:34.270 --> 04:02:39.270
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of people who died in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first two battles of by drowning.</v>

4191
04:02:41.200 --> 04:02:43.870
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a complex,</v>

4192
04:02:44.110 --> 04:02:49.110
<v Speaker 1>very fragile system of dikes and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>water and flood control measures that </v>

4193
04:02:49.110 --> 04:02:54.031
<v Speaker 1>have been implemented in that area over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the centuries to keep the water from </v>

4194
04:02:54.031 --> 04:02:57.991
<v Speaker 1>taking it over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The artillery has done great damage to </v>

4195
04:02:57.991 --> 04:03:01.081
<v Speaker 1>that before third iep right now with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this wonderful barrage of 4 million </v>

4196
04:03:01.081 --> 04:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>shells that the British have have </v>
<v Speaker 1>launched into this area.</v>

4197
04:03:03.850 --> 04:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>They've destroyed whatever was left at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that system,</v>

4198
04:03:07.680 --> 04:03:12.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's when the rain starts that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets horrifying because you take an </v>

4199
04:03:12.680 --> 04:03:15.861
<v Speaker 1>already horrifying first world war </v>
<v Speaker 1>western front battlefield of the sort </v>

4200
04:03:15.861 --> 04:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>we've described with the giant trenches </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

4201
04:03:17.620 --> 04:03:18.430
<v Speaker 1>The vegetation</v>

4202
04:03:18.430 --> 04:03:21.910
<v Speaker 3>all gone except for the little twigs and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sticks that used to be giant trees.</v>

4203
04:03:22.090 --> 04:03:24.810
<v Speaker 3>This horrific hell more door like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

4204
04:03:24.811 --> 04:03:29.811
<v Speaker 3>landscape and you flood it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we've had battles like the psalm </v>

4205
04:03:29.811 --> 04:03:31.030
<v Speaker 3>where there will be rain and you will </v>
<v Speaker 3>have moments of flooding,</v>

4206
04:03:31.031 --> 04:03:34.090
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This battlefield will start to flood and</v>

4207
04:03:34.091 --> 04:03:39.091
<v Speaker 3>it will stay that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There will only be three dry days in the</v>

4208
04:03:40.270 --> 04:03:42.220
<v Speaker 3>month of August.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

4209
04:03:42.221 --> 04:03:47.221
<v Speaker 3>they get double the normal rainfall and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this turns the area into a swamp,</v>

4210
04:03:49.900 --> 04:03:54.010
<v Speaker 3>a swamp of quicksand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and very quickly with all of the,</v>

4211
04:03:54.250 --> 04:03:56.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>casualties that start cropping up.</v>

4212
04:03:56.021 --> 04:04:01.021
<v Speaker 3>You get the same kind of situation we </v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about at the somme where the </v>

4213
04:04:01.021 --> 04:04:04.321
<v Speaker 3>shell holes which are everywhere filled </v>
<v Speaker 3>with water become like toxic dumps with </v>

4214
04:04:04.961 --> 04:04:09.961
<v Speaker 3>human body's decaying in them and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>remnants of poison gas and trash and the</v>

4215
04:04:10.061 --> 04:04:12.160
<v Speaker 3>results of them using these things as </v>
<v Speaker 3>latrines.</v>

4216
04:04:12.161 --> 04:04:14.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is the most sickening stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can think of.</v>

4217
04:04:14.711 --> 04:04:19.711
<v Speaker 3>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the problems confronting the </v>

4218
04:04:19.711 --> 04:04:20.650
<v Speaker 3>British at this battle is they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have water for the troops.</v>

4219
04:04:20.651 --> 04:04:22.960
<v Speaker 3>They have water everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have water coming out their ears,</v>

4220
04:04:22.961 --> 04:04:27.961
<v Speaker 3>but none to drink and these shallow </v>
<v Speaker 3>holes and the mud will form as nasty and</v>

4221
04:04:30.131 --> 04:04:35.131
<v Speaker 3>enemy to the soldiers fighting in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>as their know opposition and I don't </v>

4222
04:04:35.131 --> 04:04:37.150
<v Speaker 3>want to suggest it wasn't bad for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Germans either.</v>

4223
04:04:37.151 --> 04:04:39.400
<v Speaker 3>That may be the overlooked side of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Passchendaele.</v>

4224
04:04:39.550 --> 04:04:42.700
<v Speaker 3>It's so horrible and this is seared into</v>
<v Speaker 3>British consciousness.</v>

4225
04:04:42.701 --> 04:04:44.410
<v Speaker 3>Then it's so horrible for British </v>
<v Speaker 3>troops,</v>

4226
04:04:44.620 --> 04:04:46.930
<v Speaker 3>which let's remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not just English folks,</v>

4227
04:04:47.110 --> 04:04:49.090
<v Speaker 3>they're Welsh Scotch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Irish,</v>

4228
04:04:49.120 --> 04:04:50.560
<v Speaker 3>Newfoundland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Indian,</v>

4229
04:04:50.800 --> 04:04:52.240
<v Speaker 3>Australian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Zealand,</v>

4230
04:04:52.241 --> 04:04:55.090
<v Speaker 3>Canadian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm leaving some out there.</v>

4231
04:04:55.091 --> 04:04:58.780
<v Speaker 3>All their suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Germans are suffering too.</v>

4232
04:05:00.490 --> 04:05:03.970
<v Speaker 3>The rain is so bad that within just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>few days,</v>

4233
04:05:04.210 --> 04:05:07.870
<v Speaker 3>Haig has to call a halt to operations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guns are sinking.</v>

4234
04:05:08.200 --> 04:05:10.870
<v Speaker 3>You know the horses are sinking up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>their chest.</v>

4235
04:05:11.050 --> 04:05:16.050
<v Speaker 3>The people are sinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes this battle particularly </v>

4236
04:05:16.050 --> 04:05:18.850
<v Speaker 3>horrifying is that in no other battle in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first world war,</v>

4237
04:05:18.851 --> 04:05:23.851
<v Speaker 3>do you routinely see the soldiers put in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that unbelievable situation that we </v>

4238
04:05:23.851 --> 04:05:24.610
<v Speaker 3>quoted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>norman cousins,</v>

4239
04:05:24.611 --> 04:05:29.611
<v Speaker 3>that Scottish soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know as saying he was given the </v>

4240
04:05:29.611 --> 04:05:32.260
<v Speaker 3>tools to kill his fellow man if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were badly wounded on the battlefield.</v>

4241
04:05:32.650 --> 04:05:36.910
<v Speaker 3>What if they're slowly sinking in mud?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that's what was happening.</v>

4242
04:05:37.150 --> 04:05:39.730
<v Speaker 3>When we talk about battles that scar </v>
<v Speaker 3>nations,</v>

4243
04:05:39.880 --> 04:05:41.890
<v Speaker 3>what do we mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4244
04:05:41.891 --> 04:05:44.290
<v Speaker 3>in the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of thousands,</v>

4245
04:05:44.291 --> 04:05:47.980
<v Speaker 3>sometimes millions of men would go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through these terrible places.</v>

4246
04:05:48.220 --> 04:05:49.450
<v Speaker 3>Passion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dale's one,</v>

4247
04:05:49.690 --> 04:05:51.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Verdun was another.</v>

4248
04:05:51.070 --> 04:05:53.410
<v Speaker 3>The Psalm was another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Bruce and love offensive.</v>

4249
04:05:53.411 --> 04:05:55.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean these people who go through these</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible experiences,</v>

4250
04:05:56.110 --> 04:05:57.970
<v Speaker 3>number in the hundreds of thousands or </v>
<v Speaker 3>millions.</v>

4251
04:05:58.120 --> 04:06:01.480
<v Speaker 3>Those survivors then go home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>permanently changed.</v>

4252
04:06:01.720 --> 04:06:06.720
<v Speaker 3>How many human beings have to go home </v>
<v Speaker 3>permanently changed for that to ripple </v>

4253
04:06:06.720 --> 04:06:10.090
<v Speaker 3>across their entire societies?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Passchendaele did just that,</v>

4254
04:06:10.091 --> 04:06:15.091
<v Speaker 3>and part of the reason why was because </v>
<v Speaker 3>what these people saw just destroyed </v>

4255
04:06:15.091 --> 04:06:15.091
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

4256
04:06:16.430 --> 04:06:21.430
<v Speaker 3>I mean the most widely in a lampooned </v>
<v Speaker 3>poetic line is wildly lampoon because it</v>

4257
04:06:22.281 --> 04:06:25.340
<v Speaker 3>became so associated with this battle </v>
<v Speaker 3>and siegfried sassoon road,</v>

4258
04:06:25.610 --> 04:06:28.460
<v Speaker 3>I died in hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They called it passion Dale.</v>

4259
04:06:30.500 --> 04:06:34.400
<v Speaker 3>You can see pictures by the way of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>battle on the battlefield to try to keep</v>

4260
04:06:34.401 --> 04:06:39.401
<v Speaker 3>soldiers from getting stuck in the mud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They laid down duck boards and so you </v>

4261
04:06:39.401 --> 04:06:41.000
<v Speaker 3>have and you have to imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go look at pictures.</v>

4262
04:06:41.001 --> 04:06:46.001
<v Speaker 3>It is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a battlefield that looks like </v>

4263
04:06:46.001 --> 04:06:48.910
<v Speaker 3>the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If the moon had been turned to mud and </v>

4264
04:06:48.910 --> 04:06:52.931
<v Speaker 3>then on the mud to try to keep people </v>
<v Speaker 3>from sinking into it as though it's </v>

4265
04:06:52.931 --> 04:06:57.311
<v Speaker 3>quick sand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put these little teeny planks in </v>

4266
04:06:57.311 --> 04:06:59.120
<v Speaker 3>and and they and they make them look </v>
<v Speaker 3>like paths you know for,</v>

4267
04:06:59.150 --> 04:07:04.150
<v Speaker 3>for where people need to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what this does is it means that the </v>

4268
04:07:04.150 --> 04:07:06.881
<v Speaker 3>soldiers have to actually walk on those </v>
<v Speaker 3>and machine gunners can just target </v>

4269
04:07:06.881 --> 04:07:07.670
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these duck boards are blown up every</v>

4270
04:07:07.671 --> 04:07:11.000
<v Speaker 3>night by the artillery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And every night the royal engineers come</v>

4271
04:07:11.001 --> 04:07:13.700
<v Speaker 3>and rebuild them for the next day under </v>
<v Speaker 3>fire.</v>

<v Speaker 3>quotes private Norman Cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a British soldier in the first grand </v>

4275
04:07:24.010 --> 04:07:25.550
<v Speaker 3>dear guards describing you know what was</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening,</v>

4276
04:07:25.551 --> 04:07:27.200
<v Speaker 3>and it happened to thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 3>soldiers,</v>

4277
04:07:27.410 --> 04:07:32.410
<v Speaker 3>quote the approach to the Ridge was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>desolate swamp over which brew did an </v>

4278
04:07:32.410 --> 04:07:37.391
<v Speaker 3>eval menacing atmosphere that seemed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>defy encroachment far more treacherous </v>

4279
04:07:37.391 --> 04:07:40.580
<v Speaker 3>than the visible surface defenses with </v>
<v Speaker 3>which we were familiar,</v>

4280
04:07:40.581 --> 04:07:44.030
<v Speaker 3>such as barbed wire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deep devouring mud spread,</v>

4281
04:07:44.031 --> 04:07:49.031
<v Speaker 3>deadly traps in all directions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We splashed and slithered and dragged </v>

4282
04:07:49.031 --> 04:07:50.480
<v Speaker 3>our feet from the pull of an invisible </v>
<v Speaker 3>enemy,</v>

4283
04:07:50.600 --> 04:07:55.600
<v Speaker 3>determined to suck us into its depths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every few steps someone would slide and </v>

4284
04:07:55.600 --> 04:08:00.131
<v Speaker 3>stumble and weighed down by rifle and </v>
<v Speaker 3>equipment rapidly sink into the </v>

4285
04:08:00.131 --> 04:08:02.630
<v Speaker 3>squelching mess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those nearest grabbed his arms,</v>

4286
04:08:02.690 --> 04:08:06.560
<v Speaker 3>struggled against being themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>engulfed and if humanly possible dragged</v>

4287
04:08:06.561 --> 04:08:11.561
<v Speaker 3>him out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When helpers floundered in as well and </v>

4288
04:08:11.561 --> 04:08:11.780
<v Speaker 3>doubled the task,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it became hopeless.</v>

4289
04:08:12.050 --> 04:08:14.950
<v Speaker 3>All the straining efforts failed and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>swamps swallowed.</v>

4290
04:08:14.951 --> 04:08:19.951
<v Speaker 3>It's screaming victims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we had to be ordered to Plod on </v>

4291
04:08:19.951 --> 04:08:21.620
<v Speaker 3>dejectedly and fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This relentless enemy has stubbornly.</v>

4292
04:08:21.621 --> 04:08:26.621
<v Speaker 3>As we did those we could see it happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one of those leading us was </v>

4293
04:08:26.621 --> 04:08:27.150
<v Speaker 3>Lieutenant Chamberlain and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>distracted.</v>

4294
04:08:27.170 --> 04:08:32.170
<v Speaker 3>He become at the spectacle of men </v>
<v Speaker 3>drowning in mud and the desperate </v>

4295
04:08:32.170 --> 04:08:35.831
<v Speaker 3>attempts to rescue them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that suddenly he began hysterically </v>

4296
04:08:35.831 --> 04:08:37.550
<v Speaker 3>belaboring the shoulders of a singing </v>
<v Speaker 3>man with his swagger stick.</v>

4297
04:08:37.880 --> 04:08:41.240
<v Speaker 3>We were horror struck to see this most </v>
<v Speaker 3>compassionate officer,</v>

4298
04:08:41.300 --> 04:08:44.780
<v Speaker 3>so unstrung as to resort to brutality </v>
<v Speaker 3>and are loud.</v>

4299
04:08:44.781 --> 04:08:48.260
<v Speaker 3>Protests forced him to desist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The man was rescued,</v>

4300
04:08:48.440 --> 04:08:50.450
<v Speaker 3>but some could not be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they sank.</v>

4301
04:08:50.451 --> 04:08:53.090
<v Speaker 3>Shrieking with fear and agony to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>ordered.</v>

4302
04:08:53.091 --> 04:08:57.440
<v Speaker 3>To Go ahead and leave a comrade to such </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fate was the hardest experience.</v>

4303
04:08:57.560 --> 04:09:02.560
<v Speaker 3>One could be asked to endure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the objective had to be reached and </v>

4304
04:09:02.560 --> 04:09:06.491
<v Speaker 3>we plunged on bitter anger against the </v>
<v Speaker 3>evil forces prevailing piled onto our </v>

4305
04:09:06.491 --> 04:09:11.471
<v Speaker 3>exasperations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was as near to hell as I ever want </v>

4306
04:09:11.471 --> 04:09:14.340
<v Speaker 3>to be and to quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Brian Cooper's</v>

<v Speaker 4>the ironclads of Cumbrae.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He quotes a soldier at IPR saying,</v>

4308
04:09:18.621 --> 04:09:21.450
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of our men was unfortunate enough to</v>

4309
04:09:21.451 --> 04:09:24.660
<v Speaker 4>step out of line and fell into one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these mud holes.</v>

4310
04:09:24.870 --> 04:09:27.630
<v Speaker 4>We managed to loop a rope securely under</v>
<v Speaker 4>his armpits,</v>

4311
04:09:27.810 --> 04:09:32.810
<v Speaker 4>but it was useless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The poor fellow now knew he was beyond </v>

4312
04:09:32.810 --> 04:09:34.530
<v Speaker 4>all aid and begged me to shoot him </v>
<v Speaker 4>rather than leave him to die.</v>

4313
04:09:34.531 --> 04:09:39.531
<v Speaker 4>A miserable death by suffocation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am not afraid to say therefore that I </v>

4314
04:09:39.531 --> 04:09:41.430
<v Speaker 4>shot this man at his own urgent request.</v>

<v Speaker 3>End Quote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the accounts,</v>

4316
04:09:46.121 --> 04:09:51.121
<v Speaker 3>it's clear that this particular mode of </v>
<v Speaker 3>dying affected the soldiers you know </v>

4317
04:09:51.121 --> 04:09:55.951
<v Speaker 3>worse than most of the other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the true extra horror of </v>

4320
04:10:02.200 --> 04:10:05.740
<v Speaker 3>quotes of British major at Third Ybarra </v>
<v Speaker 3>who says,</v>

4321
04:10:05.741 --> 04:10:07.930
<v Speaker 3>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a party of a company,</v>

4322
04:10:07.931 --> 04:10:12.580
<v Speaker 3>men passing up to the front line found a</v>
<v Speaker 3>man bogged to above the knees,</v>

4323
04:10:12.790 --> 04:10:14.980
<v Speaker 3>bogged with mud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He means he says,</v>

4324
04:10:14.981 --> 04:10:19.981
<v Speaker 3>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the united efforts of four of them with </v>

4325
04:10:19.981 --> 04:10:21.430
<v Speaker 3>rifles beneath his armpits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>made not the slightest impression,</v>

4326
04:10:21.580 --> 04:10:26.580
<v Speaker 3>and to dig even if shovels had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>available would be impossible for there </v>

4327
04:10:26.580 --> 04:10:28.930
<v Speaker 3>was no foothold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Duty compelled them to move on up to the</v>

4328
04:10:28.931 --> 04:10:33.931
<v Speaker 3>line and when two days later they passed</v>
<v Speaker 3>down that way the wretched fellow was </v>

4329
04:10:33.931 --> 04:10:36.400
<v Speaker 3>still there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but only his head was now visible and he</v>

4330
04:10:36.401 --> 04:10:41.401
<v Speaker 3>was raving mad and to quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just like most of the other bad </v>

4331
04:10:43.051 --> 04:10:48.051
<v Speaker 3>world war one battles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the people stuck out in no </v>

4332
04:10:48.051 --> 04:10:51.570
<v Speaker 3>man's land that you couldn't go get </v>
<v Speaker 3>drove the men in the trenches.</v>

4333
04:10:51.571 --> 04:10:56.250
<v Speaker 3>They're comrades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just almost insane with powerlessness.</v>

04:10:57.780 --> 04:11:00.730
<v Speaker 3>Historian John Keegan quotes British </v>
<v Speaker 3>soldier Edwin Vaughn,</v>

4335
04:11:01.160 --> 04:11:06.160
<v Speaker 3>who was at the third IPA and who </v>
<v Speaker 3>describes how the rain takes a known </v>

4336
04:11:06.331 --> 04:11:11.331
<v Speaker 3>horrific situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people stuck in no man's land and </v>

4337
04:11:11.331 --> 04:11:14.010
<v Speaker 3>the suffering that they went through and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the suffering that they then transmitted</v>

4338
04:11:14.011 --> 04:11:19.011
<v Speaker 3>to their powerless comrades in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>trenches and made it worse by just </v>

4339
04:11:19.011 --> 04:11:19.011
<v Speaker 3>adding water.</v>

4340
04:11:20.670 --> 04:11:24.330
<v Speaker 3>Soldier von talks about being in a shell</v>
<v Speaker 3>hole and then says,</v>

4341
04:11:24.331 --> 04:11:24.720
<v Speaker 3>quote</v>

4342
04:11:26.070 --> 04:11:29.940
<v Speaker 3>from other shell holes from the darkness</v>
<v Speaker 3>on all sides came,</v>

4343
04:11:29.941 --> 04:11:34.440
<v Speaker 3>the groans and whales of wounded men </v>
<v Speaker 3>faint long sobbing,</v>

4344
04:11:34.441 --> 04:11:39.441
<v Speaker 3>moans of agony and despairing shrieks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was too horribly obvious that dozens </v>

4345
04:11:39.441 --> 04:11:44.391
<v Speaker 3>of men with serious wounds must've </v>
<v Speaker 3>crawled for safety into new shell holes </v>

4346
04:11:44.391 --> 04:11:47.610
<v Speaker 3>and now the water was rising about them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and powerless to move.</v>

4347
04:11:47.760 --> 04:11:52.760
<v Speaker 3>They were slowly drowning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Horrible visions came to me with those </v>

4348
04:11:52.760 --> 04:11:53.730
<v Speaker 3>cries of men lying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maimed out there,</v>

4349
04:11:53.731 --> 04:11:58.440
<v Speaker 3>trusting that their pals would find them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now dying terribly alone amongst the</v>

4350
04:11:58.441 --> 04:12:01.830
<v Speaker 3>dead and the inky darkness and we could </v>
<v Speaker 3>do nothing to help them.</v>

4351
04:12:02.100 --> 04:12:07.100
<v Speaker 3>Dunham was crying quietly beside me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the men were affected by the </v>

4352
04:12:07.100 --> 04:12:08.040
<v Speaker 3>prettiest cries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the quote,</v>

4353
04:12:09.720 --> 04:12:13.000
<v Speaker 3>Lieutenant Edwin Vaughn and men are </v>
<v Speaker 3>relieved a couple hours later.</v>

4354
04:12:14.160 --> 04:12:16.590
<v Speaker 3>And as they're walking back down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>line,</v>

4355
04:12:16.890 --> 04:12:21.890
<v Speaker 3>he noticed his quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cries of the wounded had been much </v>

4356
04:12:21.890 --> 04:12:23.010
<v Speaker 3>diminished now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as we staggered down the road,</v>

4357
04:12:23.160 --> 04:12:28.160
<v Speaker 3>the reason was only two apparent for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>water was right over the tops of the </v>

4358
04:12:28.160 --> 04:12:30.580
<v Speaker 3>shell holes and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

4359
04:12:30.581 --> 04:12:35.581
<v Speaker 3>if you want it to look at this battle </v>
<v Speaker 3>which went on for months in military </v>

4360
04:12:35.581 --> 04:12:38.830
<v Speaker 3>terms and you wanted to look at it </v>
<v Speaker 3>positively as some modern historians do,</v>

4361
04:12:39.100 --> 04:12:44.100
<v Speaker 3>you could say that it killed between 220</v>
<v Speaker 3>and 350,000</v>

4362
04:12:44.441 --> 04:12:46.030
<v Speaker 3>more Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing wrong with that.</v>

4363
04:12:46.120 --> 04:12:50.470
<v Speaker 3>In a war of attrition right course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're the British political command,</v>

4364
04:12:50.471 --> 04:12:55.471
<v Speaker 3>you will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll note that it killed about the </v>

4365
04:12:55.471 --> 04:12:55.471
<v Speaker 3>same number of British soldiers.</v>

4366
04:12:56.860 --> 04:13:01.860
<v Speaker 3>It gained a few miles in some places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Canadians heroically captured the </v>

4367
04:13:01.860 --> 04:13:06.810
<v Speaker 3>town of Passchendaele against all odds </v>
<v Speaker 3>and through much suffering and </v>

4368
04:13:06.810 --> 04:13:07.780
<v Speaker 3>persevering.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

4369
04:13:08.380 --> 04:13:13.380
<v Speaker 3>it's not quite apparent how this really </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushed the end of the war any closer.</v>

4370
04:13:15.870 --> 04:13:18.270
<v Speaker 3>It definitely pushed a lot of soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

4371
04:13:18.810 --> 04:13:23.130
<v Speaker 3>closer to a transformation that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>would eventually,</v>

4372
04:13:23.131 --> 04:13:27.960
<v Speaker 3>if they lived to make it home transfer </v>
<v Speaker 3>to their entire society.</v>

4373
04:13:28.350 --> 04:13:31.500
<v Speaker 3>British soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ronald Skirt was for ever transformed by</v>

4374
04:13:31.501 --> 04:13:35.640
<v Speaker 3>his experiences in flanders in 1917,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as were so many others.</v>

4375
04:13:35.910 --> 04:13:39.120
<v Speaker 3>It crushed the underpinnings of so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>of his worldview.</v>

4376
04:13:39.630 --> 04:13:42.510
<v Speaker 3>He writes about the battle quote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

4377
04:13:42.511 --> 04:13:46.350
<v Speaker 3>the men's morale was breaking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose I should have included myself.</v>

4378
04:13:46.620 --> 04:13:50.280
<v Speaker 3>I had long since lost any desire to </v>
<v Speaker 3>continue as a fighting soldier.</v>

4379
04:13:50.490 --> 04:13:53.670
<v Speaker 3>Idealists and cowards aren't of much use</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a battlefield,</v>

4380
04:13:53.671 --> 04:13:56.010
<v Speaker 3>and I was a bit of both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At 19,</v>

4381
04:13:56.011 --> 04:13:58.620
<v Speaker 3>I found my standards of conduct </v>
<v Speaker 3>obsolete.</v>

4382
04:13:58.890 --> 04:14:03.890
<v Speaker 3>My ideal shattered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had lost all faith in institutional </v>

4383
04:14:03.890 --> 04:14:05.430
<v Speaker 3>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My church had authorized me to break the</v>

4384
04:14:05.431 --> 04:14:08.880
<v Speaker 3>sixth commandment in the name of </v>
<v Speaker 3>patriotism and quote</v>

4385
04:14:10.340 --> 04:14:13.490
<v Speaker 3>he continues quote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eventually I worked at all out.</v>

4386
04:14:13.820 --> 04:14:16.520
<v Speaker 3>At least for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God was all right.</v>

4387
04:14:16.730 --> 04:14:21.730
<v Speaker 3>It was we who were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why the hell should he care what </v>

4388
04:14:21.730 --> 04:14:25.271
<v Speaker 3>happened to us a lot?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had brought this war evil into </v>

4389
04:14:25.271 --> 04:14:25.271
<v Speaker 3>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not God.</v>

4390
04:14:25.271 --> 04:14:28.760
<v Speaker 3>The reason evil and ugliness were </v>
<v Speaker 3>triumphing over goodness and beauty.</v>

4391
04:14:28.970 --> 04:14:30.320
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pity and compassion.</v>

4392
04:14:30.321 --> 04:14:35.321
<v Speaker 3>We're considered weaknesses and </v>
<v Speaker 3>ruthlessness and cruelty regarded as </v>

4393
04:14:35.321 --> 04:14:38.930
<v Speaker 3>noble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason for all this was the </v>

4394
04:14:38.930 --> 04:14:39.350
<v Speaker 3>wickedness in ourselves and not the </v>
<v Speaker 3>indifference of God.</v>

4395
04:14:39.710 --> 04:14:41.810
<v Speaker 3>That's why the more murders you </v>
<v Speaker 3>committed,</v>

4396
04:14:41.930 --> 04:14:46.930
<v Speaker 3>the bigger the hero you became.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what made your superior officers </v>

4397
04:14:46.930 --> 04:14:48.590
<v Speaker 3>slap you on the back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>splendid old chap,</v>

4398
04:14:48.591 --> 04:14:51.950
<v Speaker 3>jolly good shooting when your shells had</v>
<v Speaker 3>destroyed in minutes,</v>

4399
04:14:52.130 --> 04:14:56.990
<v Speaker 3>the beauty which craftsman had toiled </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifetimes to create disillusion is very,</v>

4400
04:14:56.991 --> 04:14:58.430
<v Speaker 3>very bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're young,</v>

4401
04:14:58.610 --> 04:15:00.080
<v Speaker 3>thoughtful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imaginative,</v>

4402
04:15:00.110 --> 04:15:02.150
<v Speaker 3>and sensitive and quote</v>

4403
04:15:03.960 --> 04:15:08.870
<v Speaker 3>in the postscript to his memoirs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>writing in the third person skirts,</v>

4404
04:15:09.230 --> 04:15:14.000
<v Speaker 3>quote before 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>17 ended this unbelieved.</v>

4405
04:15:14.001 --> 04:15:19.001
<v Speaker 3>You're insensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Youth had escaped death by inches a </v>

4406
04:15:19.001 --> 04:15:22.751
<v Speaker 3>dozen times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had seen his comrades die in dreadful </v>

4407
04:15:22.751 --> 04:15:23.960
<v Speaker 3>agony.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had seen and heard man,</v>

4408
04:15:23.961 --> 04:15:26.630
<v Speaker 3>who should have been dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men broken,</v>

4409
04:15:26.750 --> 04:15:31.190
<v Speaker 3>torn limbless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>disemboweled screaming for anyone with a</v>

4410
04:15:31.191 --> 04:15:33.140
<v Speaker 3>loaded rifle to end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're unbearable.</v>

4411
04:15:33.141 --> 04:15:38.141
<v Speaker 3>Sufferings and watched his friends and </v>
<v Speaker 3>others slowly choke and froth is poison.</v>

4412
04:15:38.481 --> 04:15:42.550
<v Speaker 3>Gas suffocated them could not believe it</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible until his own eyes.</v>

4413
04:15:42.570 --> 04:15:47.570
<v Speaker 3>Told him it was that half a man could </v>
<v Speaker 3>live for what seemed to him hours and by</v>

4414
04:15:47.901 --> 04:15:52.901
<v Speaker 3>the time he was rendered unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself had come to realize that every </v>

4415
04:15:52.901 --> 04:15:56.801
<v Speaker 3>friend he'd made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every man he'd worked with had become </v>

4416
04:15:56.801 --> 04:16:00.161
<v Speaker 3>cannon fodder for years afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Memories of these horrors haunted his </v>

4417
04:16:00.161 --> 04:16:02.930
<v Speaker 3>dreams and disturbed his sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet awake.</v>

4418
04:16:02.931 --> 04:16:07.931
<v Speaker 3>He could never bring himself to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and when he thought of those </v>

4419
04:16:07.931 --> 04:16:09.530
<v Speaker 3>wounded men and the comrades he'd been </v>
<v Speaker 3>with when they were killed,</v>

4420
04:16:09.710 --> 04:16:13.880
<v Speaker 3>he always came to the same conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It must never happen again.</v>

4421
04:16:14.090 --> 04:16:19.090
<v Speaker 3>Never and to quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were hundreds of thousands of </v>

4422
04:16:20.511 --> 04:16:25.511
<v Speaker 3>survivors like this young man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they went home and greatly </v>

4423
04:16:27.081 --> 04:16:29.870
<v Speaker 3>influenced their home societies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4424
04:16:29.871 --> 04:16:34.871
<v Speaker 3>there are literary historians that will </v>
<v Speaker 3>point to the influence these people had </v>

4425
04:16:34.871 --> 04:16:38.690
<v Speaker 3>in the writings of the 19 twenties and </v>
<v Speaker 3>19 thirties everywhere.</v>

4426
04:16:41.120 --> 04:16:42.830
<v Speaker 3>War Artists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul Nash,</v>

4427
04:16:42.831 --> 04:16:45.860
<v Speaker 3>was another one permanently affected by </v>
<v Speaker 3>Passchendaele.</v>

4428
04:16:46.430 --> 04:16:49.310
<v Speaker 3>He'd been to other areas and thought the</v>
<v Speaker 3>war quite nice,</v>

4429
04:16:49.311 --> 04:16:53.990
<v Speaker 3>and then went to passchendaele and had </v>
<v Speaker 3>his entire world turned upside down.</v>

4430
04:16:54.290 --> 04:16:57.830
<v Speaker 3>This is as related by David Reynolds in </v>
<v Speaker 3>his fine history,</v>

4431
04:16:57.831 --> 04:17:02.831
<v Speaker 3>the long shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He starts off by saying that Nash </v>

4432
04:17:02.831 --> 04:17:04.900
<v Speaker 3>enjoyed all these other areas of the war</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then writes quote,</v>

4433
04:17:05.290 --> 04:17:08.630
<v Speaker 3>but when Nash returned in November to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the rain and mode of passion,</v>

4434
04:17:08.631 --> 04:17:13.631
<v Speaker 3>Dale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was transfixed by quote the most </v>

4435
04:17:13.631 --> 04:17:15.910
<v Speaker 3>frightful nightmare of a country more </v>
<v Speaker 3>conceived by Dante or po.</v>

4436
04:17:15.911 --> 04:17:19.930
<v Speaker 3>Then by nature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with no glimmer of God's hand to be seen</v>

4437
04:17:19.931 --> 04:17:24.931
<v Speaker 3>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sunrise and sunset or blasphemies </v>

4438
04:17:24.931 --> 04:17:25.300
<v Speaker 3>Reynolds says he exclaimed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quote,</v>

4439
04:17:25.600 --> 04:17:30.600
<v Speaker 3>they are mockeries to man and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reynolds writes that the scene he says </v>

4440
04:17:32.741 --> 04:17:37.741
<v Speaker 3>was gilded with the colors of hell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yellow stinking mud shell holes filled </v>

4441
04:17:37.741 --> 04:17:42.631
<v Speaker 3>with green whitewater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>black dying trees and unceasing shells </v>

4442
04:17:42.671 --> 04:17:45.070
<v Speaker 3>that churned up the land into a </v>
<v Speaker 3>graveyard.</v>

4443
04:17:45.210 --> 04:17:50.210
<v Speaker 3>Quote coding nationality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am no longer in artists interested in </v>

4444
04:17:50.210 --> 04:17:55.021
<v Speaker 3>curious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am a messenger who will bring back </v>

4445
04:17:55.021 --> 04:17:57.100
<v Speaker 3>word from the men who are fighting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>those who want the war to go on forever.</v>

4446
04:17:57.280 --> 04:17:59.860
<v Speaker 3>Feeble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inarticulate will be my message,</v>

4447
04:18:00.100 --> 04:18:03.930
<v Speaker 3>but it will have a bitter truth and may </v>
<v Speaker 3>have burned their lousy souls.</v>

4448
04:18:04.440 --> 04:18:05.110
<v Speaker 3>And quote</v>

4449
04:18:06.840 --> 04:18:09.140
<v Speaker 1>British war correspondent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Philip Gibbs was there,</v>

4450
04:18:09.141 --> 04:18:14.141
<v Speaker 1>has been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I keep us all over that battlefield </v>

4451
04:18:14.141 --> 04:18:16.990
<v Speaker 1>and he had a true admiration for not </v>
<v Speaker 1>just the English troops but all the </v>

4452
04:18:17.730 --> 04:18:19.780
<v Speaker 1>dominion troops to and what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplished,</v>

4453
04:18:19.781 --> 04:18:24.781
<v Speaker 1>their sort of a doomed heroism and gibbs</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just blown away by what human beings</v>

4454
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:30.670
<v Speaker 1>in these gallon soldiers were able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve and nothing upset him more than </v>

4455
04:18:30.670 --> 04:18:34.931
<v Speaker 1>to hear later that Sir Douglas Haig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British commander had proclaimed </v>

4456
04:18:34.931 --> 04:18:39.710
<v Speaker 1>reports of the battlefield at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Passchendaele as being exaggerated.</v>

4457
04:18:40.610 --> 04:18:43.460
<v Speaker 1>This is how a very angry gibbs </v>
<v Speaker 1>responded.</v>

4458
04:18:43.490 --> 04:18:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Quote Sir Douglas Haig thinks that some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the descriptions of that six months </v>

4459
04:18:48.490 --> 04:18:53.291
<v Speaker 1>horror where quote end quote exaggerated</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a man who knows something of the </v>

4460
04:18:53.291 --> 04:18:57.731
<v Speaker 1>value of words and who saw many of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>battles scenes in flanders and went out </v>

4461
04:18:57.731 --> 04:19:02.141
<v Speaker 1>from her many times during those months </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he names all the places that </v>

4462
04:19:02.141 --> 04:19:05.891
<v Speaker 1>he'd been and ends up by saying and </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond to polygon wood and Passion Dale,</v>

4463
04:19:06.020 --> 04:19:11.020
<v Speaker 1>where his dad lay meaning the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That Haig was responsible for where his </v>

4464
04:19:11.871 --> 04:19:16.871
<v Speaker 1>dead lay in the swamps and round the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pillboxes and were tanks that are </v>

4465
04:19:16.871 --> 04:19:17.870
<v Speaker 1>wallowed into the mire were shot into </v>
<v Speaker 1>scrap.</v>

4466
04:19:17.871 --> 04:19:22.871
<v Speaker 1>Iron by German gunfire and where our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>guns were being flung up by the </v>

4467
04:19:22.871 --> 04:19:27.071
<v Speaker 1>harassing fire of heavy shells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say now that nothing that has been </v>

4468
04:19:27.071 --> 04:19:30.881
<v Speaker 1>written is more than a pale image of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>abomination of those battlefields and </v>

4469
04:19:30.881 --> 04:19:35.411
<v Speaker 1>that no pen or brush has yet achieved </v>
<v Speaker 1>the picture of that Armageddon in which </v>

4470
04:19:35.411 --> 04:19:37.070
<v Speaker 1>so many of our men perished and quote,</v>

4471
04:19:38.880 --> 04:19:43.880
<v Speaker 1>many people began to doubt British </v>
<v Speaker 1>military leadership just because they </v>

4472
04:19:43.880 --> 04:19:46.890
<v Speaker 1>would think you should ever fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions that were that bad.</v>

4473
04:19:47.160 --> 04:19:49.560
<v Speaker 1>There's a story and some people doubted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever happened.</v>

4474
04:19:49.561 --> 04:19:54.561
<v Speaker 1>It used to be something that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned by almost everyone writing </v>

4475
04:19:54.561 --> 04:19:55.410
<v Speaker 1>about passion Dale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In his book in Flanders Fields.</v>

4476
04:19:55.411 --> 04:20:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Leon Wolf tells the story his way and </v>
<v Speaker 1>says the following day,</v>

4477
04:20:00.390 --> 04:20:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Lieutenant General Sir Lancelot Cagle </v>
<v Speaker 1>paid his first visit to the fighting </v>

4478
04:20:05.390 --> 04:20:08.680
<v Speaker 1>zone as a staff car lurched through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>swamp land and near the battleground,</v>

4479
04:20:08.760 --> 04:20:11.280
<v Speaker 1>he became more and more agitated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

4480
04:20:11.281 --> 04:20:13.890
<v Speaker 1>he burst into tears and muttered good </v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

4481
04:20:13.891 --> 04:20:18.891
<v Speaker 1>Did we really send men to fight in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the man beside him who had been through </v>

4482
04:20:18.891 --> 04:20:23.661
<v Speaker 1>the campaign replied tone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leslie gets worse further on up and to </v>

4483
04:20:23.661 --> 04:20:28.371
<v Speaker 1>quote some say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be ridiculous to think that </v>

4484
04:20:28.371 --> 04:20:31.911
<v Speaker 1>these military folks had not been out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the field and seeing the conditions are </v>

4485
04:20:31.911 --> 04:20:35.721
<v Speaker 1>known what they were like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to take a position on </v>

4486
04:20:35.721 --> 04:20:38.571
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I will suggest is that there were a </v>

4487
04:20:38.571 --> 04:20:40.950
<v Speaker 1>lot of people who looked at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions of passion Dale and wondered,</v>

4488
04:20:41.580 --> 04:20:46.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was going on in the heads of </v>

4489
04:20:46.580 --> 04:20:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Britain's military leaders.</v>

4490
04:20:46.870 --> 04:20:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Passchendaele is one of the most often </v>
<v Speaker 1>cited nightmares of this war to </v>

4491
04:20:52.301 --> 04:20:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Britain's along with the song and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the psalm,</v>

4492
04:20:55.780 --> 04:20:58.840
<v Speaker 1>it did terrible damage to Britain's </v>
<v Speaker 1>army,</v>

4493
04:21:00.510 --> 04:21:05.380
<v Speaker 1>British military historian John Keegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is definitely in the Anti Haig camp,</v>

4494
04:21:05.381 --> 04:21:10.381
<v Speaker 1>wrote quote on the Psalm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had sent the flower of British youth </v>

4495
04:21:10.381 --> 04:21:14.550
<v Speaker 1>to death or mutilation at passchendaele.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had tipped the survivors into the </v>

4496
04:21:14.550 --> 04:21:19.291
<v Speaker 1>slew of despond and quote for those in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain's political class that wished </v>

4497
04:21:21.010 --> 04:21:23.470
<v Speaker 1>the generals would pay more attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties.</v>

4498
04:21:23.471 --> 04:21:27.280
<v Speaker 1>They would get their wish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not for an entire generation.</v>

4499
04:21:28.090 --> 04:21:33.090
<v Speaker 1>The junior officers at places like </v>
<v Speaker 1>passchendaele would be permanently </v>

4500
04:21:33.090 --> 04:21:36.811
<v Speaker 1>affected by that battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>British military writer Brigadier Peter </v>

4501
04:21:36.811 --> 04:21:36.811
<v Speaker 1>Young wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

4502
04:21:37.630 --> 04:21:42.630
<v Speaker 1>the memory of this battle affected </v>
<v Speaker 1>British leadership in the Second World </v>

4503
04:21:42.630 --> 04:21:46.830
<v Speaker 1>War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>causing many commanders to go to </v>

4504
04:21:46.830 --> 04:21:47.410
<v Speaker 1>extremes to try to avoid casualties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

4505
04:21:48.460 --> 04:21:53.460
<v Speaker 1>this attitude will come a generation too</v>
<v Speaker 1>late for leaders like Lloyd George,</v>

4506
04:21:56.650 --> 04:22:01.650
<v Speaker 1>he and his allies had tried to call off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the passchendaele campaign after the </v>

4507
04:22:01.650 --> 04:22:05.521
<v Speaker 1>first sort of impetus was spent only to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fail once again up against the military </v>

4508
04:22:06.641 --> 04:22:10.440
<v Speaker 1>leadership and was heard to say blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mud,</v>

4509
04:22:10.620 --> 04:22:13.090
<v Speaker 1>bloods and mod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can think of nothing better,</v>

4510
04:22:15.460 --> 04:22:19.560
<v Speaker 1>but it should be said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the British are suffering,</v>

4511
04:22:19.561 --> 04:22:24.561
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of casualties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so are the Germans and their soldiers </v>

4512
04:22:24.871 --> 04:22:29.871
<v Speaker 1>are being as tragically affected by this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting as the British soldiers.</v>

4513
04:22:34.340 --> 04:22:39.340
<v Speaker 1>The German general Hermann von Cool </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote in his report about the troops </v>

4514
04:22:39.340 --> 04:22:41.990
<v Speaker 1>fighting in flanders quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sufferings,</v>

4515
04:22:41.991 --> 04:22:43.520
<v Speaker 1>privation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and exertions,</v>

4516
04:22:43.521 --> 04:22:46.700
<v Speaker 1>which the soldiers had to bear were </v>
<v Speaker 1>indescribable.</v>

4517
04:22:47.060 --> 04:22:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the spiritual burden on the lonely </v>

4518
04:22:52.060 --> 04:22:52.880
<v Speaker 1>man in a shell hole or trench and </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>

4519
04:22:52.881 --> 04:22:55.640
<v Speaker 1>The strain on the nerves during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British bombardment,</v>

4520
04:22:56.000 --> 04:23:01.000
<v Speaker 1>which continued day and night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell of Verdun and the Somme was </v>

4521
04:23:01.000 --> 04:23:02.420
<v Speaker 1>exceeded by flanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the battle,</v>

4522
04:23:02.421 --> 04:23:05.630
<v Speaker 1>the whole flanders has been the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>martyrdom of the war,</v>

4523
04:23:05.840 --> 04:23:10.840
<v Speaker 1>and looking back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems that what was born here was </v>

4524
04:23:10.840 --> 04:23:12.920
<v Speaker 1>superhuman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps it may still prove to be too</v>

4525
04:23:12.921 --> 04:23:16.370
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A courageous sacrifice and to quote,</v>

4526
04:23:18.390 --> 04:23:23.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what general cool didn't know December </v>

4527
04:23:23.390 --> 04:23:26.091
<v Speaker 1>1917 was that something was taking root </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would end up leading to the German </v>

4528
04:23:30.901 --> 04:23:35.610
<v Speaker 1>military commanders getting their hands </v>
<v Speaker 1>on between 500,000</v>

4529
04:23:36.210 --> 04:23:41.210
<v Speaker 1>and a million fresh veteran rested </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers.</v>

4530
04:23:43.380 --> 04:23:48.380
<v Speaker 1>Fate is about to put the dice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the iron dice back into the hands of </v>

4531
04:23:48.380 --> 04:23:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Germany's leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's well known.</v>

4532
04:23:52.400 --> 04:23:57.400
<v Speaker 1>They are already inveterate gamblers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chance to try to throw a knockout </v>

4533
04:23:59.251 --> 04:24:04.251
<v Speaker 1>punch in a war where both sides like </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly beat up and permanently damaged </v>

4534
04:24:05.931 --> 04:24:08.330
<v Speaker 1>fighters will be irresistible.</v>

4535
04:24:09.910 --> 04:24:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Seems like no matter what Lloyd George </v>
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>

4536
04:24:13.480 --> 04:24:16.060
<v Speaker 1>there's more blood and mud and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's future.</v>

4537
04:24:17.760 --> 04:24:18.870

4544
04:24:45.440 --> 04:24:47.980
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to apologize for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things right off the bat.</v>

4545
04:24:48.640 --> 04:24:53.050
<v Speaker 1>The first thing is for silly little </v>
<v Speaker 1>persnickety mistakes</v>

4546
04:24:54.330 --> 04:24:59.330
<v Speaker 1>you can probably tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you wait for these </v>

4547
04:24:59.330 --> 04:25:01.110
<v Speaker 1>programs to be released as we make them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm a bit of a nut when it comes to</v>

4548
04:25:01.111 --> 04:25:06.111
<v Speaker 1>detail and yet the people around me keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me that there's a certain </v>

4549
04:25:06.111 --> 04:25:08.490
<v Speaker 1>failure rate that should be expected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really good at accepting that,</v>

4550
04:25:08.491 --> 04:25:11.280
<v Speaker 1>especially when I catch the errors </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the show gets out.</v>

4551
04:25:11.820 --> 04:25:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one will go out with me saying the </v>

4552
04:25:16.820 --> 04:25:20.211
<v Speaker 1>word trenches to describe the kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortifications that the British Orien at</v>

4553
04:25:21.931 --> 04:25:26.220
<v Speaker 1>passchendaele and of course shell holes </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be a much closer term.</v>

4554
04:25:26.221 --> 04:25:31.221
<v Speaker 1>I think trenches to those British </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers would have been a luxury on </v>

4555
04:25:31.221 --> 04:25:31.221
<v Speaker 1>that battlefield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

4556
04:25:31.221 --> 04:25:36.200
<v Speaker 1>those are the pedal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The little things that slipped through </v>

4557
04:25:36.200 --> 04:25:39.321
<v Speaker 1>our strainer here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when we catch them so that these </v>

4558
04:25:39.321 --> 04:25:42.231
<v Speaker 1>shows come out more than once a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we are just barely beating that I </v>

4559
04:25:42.231 --> 04:25:46.340
<v Speaker 1>think right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heading toward once a year if this pace </v>

4560
04:25:46.340 --> 04:25:49.071
<v Speaker 1>keeps up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I apologize for the piddly little </v>

4561
04:25:49.071 --> 04:25:49.071
<v Speaker 1>errors in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones in this show,</v>

4562
04:25:49.071 --> 04:25:50.440
<v Speaker 1>any in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4563
04:25:50.550 --> 04:25:55.550
<v Speaker 1>we try hard but we're not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I'd like to apologize </v>

4564
04:25:56.281 --> 04:26:01.281
<v Speaker 1>for his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for perhaps ignoring your favorite part </v>

4565
04:26:01.281 --> 04:26:01.281
<v Speaker 1>of this story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that might be.</v>

4566
04:26:01.310 --> 04:26:03.470
<v Speaker 1>A favorite region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a favorite army,</v>

4567
04:26:03.471 --> 04:26:05.250
<v Speaker 1>a favorite people or favorite event.</v>

4568
04:26:07.000 --> 04:26:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Picking a topic like this is humbling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

4569
04:26:11.380 --> 04:26:15.400
<v Speaker 1>once again shows you some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential downsides with our leap before</v>

4570
04:26:15.401 --> 04:26:18.040
<v Speaker 1>we look topic picking policy here on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

4571
04:26:18.810 --> 04:26:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonetheless,</v>

4572
04:26:19.751 --> 04:26:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I will forgive in advance from now on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise I've learned my lesson,</v>

4573
04:26:23.470 --> 04:26:28.470
<v Speaker 1>every historian and author who talks too</v>
<v Speaker 1>much about the western front at the </v>

4574
04:26:28.571 --> 04:26:33.571
<v Speaker 1>expense of other areas of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>world war because you start to realize </v>

4575
04:26:33.571 --> 04:26:35.380
<v Speaker 1>why that becomes important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a very confusing story.</v>

4576
04:26:35.500 --> 04:26:40.500
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be so easy to go off in the </v>

4577
04:26:40.500 --> 04:26:44.491
<v Speaker 1>weeds and lose everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I half the time worry about losing </v>

4578
04:26:44.491 --> 04:26:45.460
<v Speaker 1>myself in the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You end up sticking to the western front</v>

4579
04:26:45.461 --> 04:26:49.180
<v Speaker 1>and Russia and the United States as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of an anchor to keep the story,</v>

4580
04:26:49.860 --> 04:26:53.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinging to some sort of structure.</v>

4581
04:26:54.340 --> 04:26:58.690
<v Speaker 1>In some ways I think it's probably the </v>
<v Speaker 1>week hosts answer to the problem.</v>

4582
04:26:58.810 --> 04:27:03.810
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you introduce theater and </v>

4583
04:27:03.810 --> 04:27:07.131
<v Speaker 1>another people and another in a region </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more names and individuals,</v>

4584
04:27:07.890 --> 04:27:09.960
<v Speaker 1>you make the story more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusing.</v>

4585
04:27:11.070 --> 04:27:15.000
<v Speaker 1>The first world war is a giant topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're getting here,</v>

4586
04:27:15.001 --> 04:27:16.890
<v Speaker 1>and I say this about all of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>productions,</v>

4587
04:27:16.891 --> 04:27:19.830
<v Speaker 1>don't I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're getting the Dan Carlin version of</v>

4588
04:27:19.831 --> 04:27:23.850
<v Speaker 1>the first world war and unfortunately </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's leaving a lot of things out,</v>

4589
04:27:23.851 --> 04:27:27.180
<v Speaker 1>but I tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a friend of mine once said,</v>

4590
04:27:27.870 --> 04:27:32.870
<v Speaker 1>perhaps we should look at it as just </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving a lot more potential future </v>

4591
04:27:32.870 --> 04:27:37.350
<v Speaker 1>hardcore history topics available for us</v>
<v Speaker 1>to handle down the road.</v>

4592
04:27:38.370 --> 04:27:43.370
<v Speaker 1>In the next show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to make up some of the </v>

4593
04:27:43.370 --> 04:27:45.891
<v Speaker 1>deficit for the things we haven't talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about and make up for some lost time in </v>

4594
04:27:45.891 --> 04:27:49.491
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are many things going on that </v>

4595
04:27:49.491 --> 04:27:49.670
<v Speaker 1>create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4596
04:27:49.671 --> 04:27:50.010
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4597
04:27:50.020 --> 04:27:52.020
<v Speaker 1>the beginnings of the modern world in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that region,</v>

4598
04:27:52.021 --> 04:27:57.021
<v Speaker 1>including important foundational events </v>
<v Speaker 1>that lay the groundwork for the modern </v>

4599
04:27:58.021 --> 04:28:03.021
<v Speaker 1>recreation of the ancient state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel in that region in Russia.</v>

4600
04:28:03.210 --> 04:28:08.210
<v Speaker 1>We get to see what an intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>contagion that might be a good way to </v>

4601
04:28:08.881 --> 04:28:13.770
<v Speaker 1>describe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped down into the middle of the very</v>

4602
04:28:13.770 --> 04:28:15.900
<v Speaker 1>fertile petri dish that is provisional </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

4603
04:28:15.901 --> 04:28:20.901
<v Speaker 1>Russia can do to a country like that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>an answer to the question will perhaps </v>

4604
04:28:20.911 --> 04:28:25.911
<v Speaker 1>arise as to whether or not an army can </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually function if the soldiers get to</v>

4605
04:28:26.071 --> 04:28:28.740
<v Speaker 1>vote on whether they want to follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>orders or not.</v>

4606
04:28:29.940 --> 04:28:34.940
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get to see the arrival of US </v>

4607
04:28:34.940 --> 04:28:37.920
<v Speaker 1>troops in large numbers on the European </v>
<v Speaker 1>continent.</v>

4608
04:28:37.921 --> 04:28:41.250
<v Speaker 1>For the first time ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm lucky and get what I want,</v>

4609
04:28:41.340 --> 04:28:46.340
<v Speaker 1>we will get to delve a little bit into </v>
<v Speaker 1>air power and how it's three </v>

4610
04:28:46.340 --> 04:28:50.661
<v Speaker 1>dimensionalizing battlefields and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>that technological race is a little </v>

4611
04:28:51.181 --> 04:28:51.820
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4612
04:28:51.850 --> 04:28:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and those guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>were involved in technology back in </v>

4613
04:28:56.850 --> 04:28:58.410
<v Speaker 1>1969,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1917.</v>

4614
04:28:58.411 --> 04:29:02.550
<v Speaker 1>They might very well be in airplane </v>
<v Speaker 1>development geeks.</v>

4615
04:29:03.330 --> 04:29:06.450
<v Speaker 1>These pilots in these planes are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4616
04:29:06.690 --> 04:29:10.410
<v Speaker 1>half Technological Geek and half </v>
<v Speaker 1>Medieval Knight.</v>

4617
04:29:10.470 --> 04:29:13.830
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk a bit about that if I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>lucky and I can make the time.</v>

4618
04:29:15.060 --> 04:29:20.060
<v Speaker 1>And finally we'll talk certainly about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference when both sides are </v>

4619
04:29:22.351 --> 04:29:27.351
<v Speaker 1>exhausted on the western front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that half a million to a million fresh </v>

4620
04:29:27.351 --> 04:29:32.271
<v Speaker 1>troops can make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not talking about American </v>

4621
04:29:32.271 --> 04:29:34.731
<v Speaker 1>troops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the German soldiers </v>

4622
04:29:34.731 --> 04:29:38.150
<v Speaker 1>that arrive from the eastern front to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the western front can make on tired </v>

4623
04:29:38.150 --> 04:29:43.101
<v Speaker 1>French and British armies before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans arrive in enough numbers to </v>

4624
04:29:43.771 --> 04:29:48.771
<v Speaker 1>make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last year of the war is full of </v>

4625
04:29:48.841 --> 04:29:53.841
<v Speaker 1>surprises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that and more on part six of </v>

4626
04:29:55.111 --> 04:29:56.460
<v Speaker 1>blueprint for Armageddon.</v>
