1
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Which military was superior?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first world war,</v>

2
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>military of the German imperial state </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the Second World War,</v>

3
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.020
<v Speaker 1>military of Nazi Germany.</v>

4
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 1>I know that sounds like a random </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

5
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually something that I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked about all the time.</v>

6
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so random either because these </v>

7
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>people are not just asking me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question out of thin air.</v>

8
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.510
<v Speaker 1>They are asking me to elaborate on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement that I once made kind of a </v>

9
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>throw away line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm remembering correctly,</v>

10
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:51.890
<v Speaker 1>where I had pointed out that I thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the first world war,</v>

11
00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:56.891
<v Speaker 1>a German military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when we say that we mean the entire </v>

12
00:00:56.891 --> 00:00:56.891
<v Speaker 1>defense apparatus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

13
00:00:56.891 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>The entire structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not the army per se,</v>

14
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:04.191
<v Speaker 1>not the navy per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of it put together with the </v>

15
00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:04.690
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grand strategy,</v>

16
00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:09.691
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the states and and armies are </v>

17
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>intertwined in ways that are key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's understand that,</v>

18
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:14.430
<v Speaker 1>but when we compare or when I do compare</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two,</v>

19
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>I was comparing the entire structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the entire structure.</v>

20
00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:21.981
<v Speaker 1>First World War Germany is military </v>
<v Speaker 1>against Second World War Germany </v>

21
00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:21.981
<v Speaker 1>military.</v>

22
00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Now what I was not prepared for was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that this would be so surprising to</v>

23
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>so many people and interesting to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be honest.</v>

24
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

25
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:33.921
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been asked to elaborate on that </v>

26
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:37.101
<v Speaker 1>question many times and no one is </v>
<v Speaker 1>argumentative by the way or upset </v>

27
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.350
<v Speaker 1>they're interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're curious and it took me a while </v>

28
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.811
<v Speaker 1>to realize why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I figured out that it's </v>

29
00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:48.621
<v Speaker 1>because it's counterintuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people out there who are not World </v>

30
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>War II buffs just assume because my </v>
<v Speaker 1>goodness,</v>

31
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>who hasn't heard seen hours of black and</v>
<v Speaker 1>white footage or what have you,</v>

32
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the stuff that Nazi Germany was </v>

33
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.481
<v Speaker 1>working on from ballistic missiles to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Panzer divisions to jet aircraft.</v>

34
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.200
<v Speaker 1>there's Nazi scientists are such great </v>
<v Speaker 1>fodder even today that that's why you </v>

36
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>have them in all the comic books and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Red Scout on the captain American.</v>

37
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean Odessa said the boys from Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it goes on and on.</v>

38
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 1>This Nazi science thing is fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

39
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.000
<v Speaker 1>so mid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

40
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.060
<v Speaker 1>it's not steam punk because it's too </v>
<v Speaker 1>late.</v>

41
00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:26.061
<v Speaker 1>It's whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mid 20th century version of steam </v>

42
00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 1>punk is first World War Germany really </v>
<v Speaker 1>is steam punk.</v>

43
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I'm trying to say is I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think there's been a lot of hype for </v>

44
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Second World War Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first World War Germany doesn't get,</v>

45
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.300
<v Speaker 1>and that's what makes it compelling to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hear a different opinion to some people.</v>

46
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why the heck am I talking about this now</v>

47
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:47.181
<v Speaker 1>and what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we even doing here towards a </v>

48
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:49.161
<v Speaker 1>little explanation since this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first new podcast we started in more </v>

49
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
<v Speaker 1>than a decade and really the first thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were going to do is just throw all </v>

50
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>this on the history feed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring that it's history,</v>

51
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.260
<v Speaker 1>but you people have taught me a valuable</v>
<v Speaker 1>lesson over time and that's that you </v>

52
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>don't want anything that isn't what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're expecting on that feed.</v>

53
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.660
<v Speaker 1>You may be okay with me interviewing </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

54
00:03:08.661 --> 00:03:13.661
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want it on your hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 1>history feed when you think you're </v>

55
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:16.181
<v Speaker 1>getting a hardcore history episodes </v>
<v Speaker 1>downloaded and it turns out to be an </v>

56
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:16.181
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've learned you want something very</v>

57
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:19.130
<v Speaker 1>specific on the hardcore history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>proper feed.</v>

58
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.680
<v Speaker 1>The problem for us of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you too,</v>

59
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.450
<v Speaker 1>is that we're averaging about two point </v>
<v Speaker 1>five new shows a year on that feed,</v>

60
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.840
<v Speaker 1>which is a long time to be out of touch </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your audience.</v>

61
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.650
<v Speaker 1>So for a very long time we have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for some sort of content,</v>

62
00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.710
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could call short form </v>
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>

63
00:03:36.711 --> 00:03:40.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm obviously a long form guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Takes me 20 minutes to clear my throat.</v>

64
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.150
<v Speaker 1>As you all know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>originally a long time ago,</v>

65
00:03:45.151 --> 00:03:49.140
<v Speaker 1>the idea of blitz additions which was </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to mean short now it just means</v>

66
00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:54.141
<v Speaker 1>a completely different kind of focus on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the show that was supposed to fill this </v>

67
00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:54.141
<v Speaker 1>gap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't work.</v>

68
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.590
<v Speaker 1>We are cutting back and that might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

69
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 1>that might be an optimistic way of even </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting it on the common sense stuff </v>

70
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.710
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you better use the time that,</v>

71
00:04:03.711 --> 00:04:04.760
<v Speaker 1>that would free up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

72
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.400
<v Speaker 1>how about touching base with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardcore history audience?</v>

73
00:04:07.401 --> 00:04:10.130
<v Speaker 1>More than two point five times a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we're trying to do here.</v>

74
00:04:10.131 --> 00:04:15.131
<v Speaker 1>And just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't decide on a format because I </v>

75
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:18.281
<v Speaker 1>liked all of them to a degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't want to get locked into </v>

76
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:18.281
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

77
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:22.181
<v Speaker 1>I like interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to have to do them all </v>

78
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:22.181
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do an interview show per</v>

79
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:25.631
<v Speaker 1>se.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like doing short little history </v>

80
00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:29.970
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I can manage to do anything short </v>

81
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.970
<v Speaker 1>that don't turn into hardcore history </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

82
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:30.820
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to be responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that every time.</v>

83
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last thing we want to do is do a new</v>

84
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:35.950
<v Speaker 1>show that takes away from the old show </v>
<v Speaker 1>that already takes too long to do.</v>

85
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:40.951
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we understand the parameters with </v>

86
00:04:40.951 --> 00:04:44.071
<v Speaker 1>which we're working here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Led Zepplin once said that their format </v>

87
00:04:44.281 --> 00:04:46.410
<v Speaker 1>for their music was tight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but loose.</v>

88
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.800
<v Speaker 1>That's the way I like to operate to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say let's have a format where,</v>

89
00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:51.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's our stuff,</v>

90
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are recognizably us.</v>

91
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.500
<v Speaker 1>But what's you're going to get?</v>

92
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 1>That's anybody's guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

93
00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.000
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word.</v>

94
00:04:59.001 --> 00:05:00.500
<v Speaker 1>And I still don't know what we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to call this.</v>

95
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.990
<v Speaker 1>This is the hardcore history overflow </v>
<v Speaker 1>feed.</v>

96
00:05:02.991 --> 00:05:05.030
<v Speaker 1>This is everything we're not putting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the regular feed,</v>

97
00:05:05.031 --> 00:05:07.970
<v Speaker 1>whether it's interviews with historians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biographers,</v>

98
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
<v Speaker 1>or maybe historical participants from </v>
<v Speaker 1>time to time.</v>

99
00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:16.001
<v Speaker 1>Love to do some primary source work </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we could record somebody's </v>

100
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>memories in digital stone and then maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere down the line historian can </v>

101
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.971
<v Speaker 1>mine that for useful info someday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be great to contribute to the storehouse</v>

102
00:05:25.821 --> 00:05:30.821
<v Speaker 1>of personal experiences and knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do have weird things I'd like to throw</v>

103
00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I may love to have a recurring</v>

104
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 1>segment that I call the worst place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be in the world.</v>

105
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.960
<v Speaker 1>I think it's self explanatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have a bunch of little things like</v>

106
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing that.</v>

107
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.920
<v Speaker 1>Nothing that I think you could base a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole podcast series on forever but </v>

108
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.800
<v Speaker 1>enough so maybe we can throw some stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

109
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:53.371
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't figure out how to make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything but Matt to you when you're </v>

111
00:05:53.371 --> 00:05:57.000
<v Speaker 1>expecting five hours or hardcore history</v>
<v Speaker 1>depth and you get 20 minutes of </v>

112
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 1>scampering over thin ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

113
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.370
<v Speaker 1>is there anything we could do in 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes where you would go,</v>

114
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:06.371
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was great when you were expecting </v>

115
00:06:06.371 --> 00:06:06.371
<v Speaker 1>five hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

116
00:06:06.371 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 1>but we feel like if nothing else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to say hi to you more often</v>

117
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:14.021
<v Speaker 1>and that's what this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the reason we're talking about the </v>

118
00:06:14.021 --> 00:06:17.591
<v Speaker 1>two World War militaries of Germany and </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparing them is because after the </v>

119
00:06:17.591 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 1>thousandth person asked me recently to </v>
<v Speaker 1>elaborate on that question,</v>

120
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 1>I was walking away from the discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a person who may or may not be real,</v>

121
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 1>who was with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned to me and said,</v>

122
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:32.951
<v Speaker 1>why don't you make that a podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just do a whole show on answering that </v>

123
00:06:32.951 --> 00:06:37.181
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which military was better first or </v>

124
00:06:37.181 --> 00:06:37.181
<v Speaker 1>Second World War Germany?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

125
00:06:37.181 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 1>you get asked about it enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's obviously an interest out there.</v>

126
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Why can't that just be a show answered </v>
<v Speaker 1>that question?</v>

127
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 1>Twenty minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 minutes,</v>

128
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

129
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Thrown out on the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>done right,</v>

130
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.700
<v Speaker 1>said hi to the audience and everything.</v>

131
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.450
<v Speaker 1>I think if we could get one of those out</v>
<v Speaker 1>a month,</v>

132
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:53.960
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't that fill in the gap a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit between epic hardcore history shows,</v>

133
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.670
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>provide anything of venture,</v>

134
00:06:57.671 --> 00:06:59.870
<v Speaker 1>so we're experimenting here a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

135
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:04.871
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to answer that question if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can and maybe this'll be one of the </v>

136
00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:08.291
<v Speaker 1>recurring segments where I essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand up amongst all of you and I make </v>

137
00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:09.710
<v Speaker 1>my case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I'm right.</v>

138
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.040
<v Speaker 1>I certainly am coming at this from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>angle of a,</v>

139
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.400
<v Speaker 1>this is my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let me throw out my viewpoint and </v>

140
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.211
<v Speaker 1>then you can talk amongst yourselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>decide whether you give it any validity </v>

141
00:07:22.211 --> 00:07:25.811
<v Speaker 1>or not and of course me being me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had planned to come in here and just </v>

142
00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:28.961
<v Speaker 1>do it off the off the cuff so it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>take any hardcore history recording </v>

143
00:07:28.961 --> 00:07:29.540
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't add to pull out the books,</v>

144
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.960
<v Speaker 1>look up some stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured who wants to just hear my </v>

145
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:34.960
<v Speaker 1>opinion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have a few supports.</v>

146
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.711
<v Speaker 1>Carlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't walk in there and just you </v>

147
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:38.711
<v Speaker 1>know you to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're gonna be a lawyer.</v>

148
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:38.930
<v Speaker 1>You've got to cite some things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have a few things to site.</v>

149
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Obviously this whole question is a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>silly and war Gamey,</v>

150
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.510
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like my silly wargame he questions</v>

151
00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 1>to be as scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hardheaded,</v>

152
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:51.590
<v Speaker 1>realistic and logical as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you?</v>

153
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 1>So let's lay out some parameters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing we have to point out is </v>

154
00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.160
<v Speaker 1>we are not talking about these two </v>
<v Speaker 1>armies fighting each other,</v>

155
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:04.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all understand how silly that would </v>

156
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.201
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't always silly and I've always </v>

157
00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:06.810
<v Speaker 1>found that interesting up until a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain point in history,</v>

158
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:12.140
<v Speaker 1>each not wild to imagine armies that </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed in very different time periods </v>

159
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:17.430
<v Speaker 1>successfully fighting one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another few said Alexander,</v>

160
00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:19.290
<v Speaker 1>the great's army's going to take on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Julius Caesar's.</v>

161
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Romans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were about 250 years later.</v>

162
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.230
<v Speaker 1>You don't automatically say Alexander's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doomed.</v>

163
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.690
<v Speaker 1>You Bet your money on Caesar and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romans,</v>

164
00:08:27.691 --> 00:08:30.330
<v Speaker 1>but if you said Alexander had a 25 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent chance of winning,</v>

165
00:08:30.331 --> 00:08:35.331
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's 250 years difference in time </v>

166
00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:38.370
<v Speaker 1>by about what would you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mid 19th century,</v>

167
00:08:38.371 --> 00:08:43.371
<v Speaker 1>somewhere that all changes when the pace</v>
<v Speaker 1>of change speeds up and all of a sudden </v>

168
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:48.570
<v Speaker 1>if you're a great power and you find </v>
<v Speaker 1>your battlefield technology 30,</v>

169
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:50.250
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years out of date,</v>

170
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:51.570
<v Speaker 1>you're in big trouble</v>

171
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:58.630
<v Speaker 1>and by the 20th century you can see this</v>
<v Speaker 1>pace of change acceleration going so </v>

172
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:03.381
<v Speaker 1>fast that the innovations that occur </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of a war can win or lose you.</v>

173
00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:09.211
<v Speaker 1>The war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you most clearly see this for </v>

174
00:09:09.211 --> 00:09:12.301
<v Speaker 1>the first time in the air war in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war where if you get a leap </v>

175
00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.580
<v Speaker 1>in terms of a technological innovation </v>
<v Speaker 1>for airplanes ahead of the other side </v>

176
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.250
<v Speaker 1>and you get your planes in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be six months of owning the sky</v>

177
00:09:21.251 --> 00:09:26.251
<v Speaker 1>before the other side catches up and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain circumstances that could cost </v>

178
00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:27.430
<v Speaker 1>you the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this technological race is getting so</v>

179
00:09:27.431 --> 00:09:28.720
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We end up,</v>

180
00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.840
<v Speaker 1>certainly by the early 20th century with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

181
00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.900
<v Speaker 1>dynamic that we see all the time now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're very comfortable with the </v>

182
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.661
<v Speaker 1>idea of innovation happening all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time during the war and the Second World</v>

183
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.170
<v Speaker 1>War all you second world war buffs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

184
00:09:41.171 --> 00:09:46.171
<v Speaker 1>how often do you think of which </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular variant of this particular </v>

185
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:46.171
<v Speaker 1>plane is this an emi one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

186
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:49.030
<v Speaker 1>nine e or g because it makes a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

187
00:09:49.031 --> 00:09:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

188
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Because the pace of change will </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally when you were lose you the war</v>

189
00:09:53.891 --> 00:09:58.891
<v Speaker 1>by about the first or Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're not comparing these two armies </v>

190
00:09:58.891 --> 00:10:01.990
<v Speaker 1>against each other because even the 1918</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of the German army,</v>

191
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:07.170
<v Speaker 1>which is really an Alpha or a Beta </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of the wehrmacht and yet it </v>

192
00:10:07.481 --> 00:10:12.481
<v Speaker 1>ain't facing the Wehrmacht successfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all and it's only a 20 year </v>

193
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:16.431
<v Speaker 1>difference between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're not pitting them against each </v>

194
00:10:16.431 --> 00:10:16.431
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're petting them,</v>

195
00:10:16.431 --> 00:10:21.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a curve based on their historical </v>

196
00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.041
<v Speaker 1>enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that point I made a second ago I </v>

197
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:23.290
<v Speaker 1>think is very relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only 20 years between each other.</v>

198
00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:26.020
<v Speaker 1>When you're 20 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems like a long time,</v>

199
00:10:26.021 --> 00:10:28.030
<v Speaker 1>but when you get to 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I am,</v>

200
00:10:28.031 --> 00:10:31.090
<v Speaker 1>50 1:20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years looks short.</v>

201
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:34.410
<v Speaker 1>As one historian said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years is not peace.</v>

202
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:38.990
<v Speaker 1>It's an intermission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a air force colonel I grew up next</v>

203
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:44.020
<v Speaker 1>door to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He always said it was the equivalent of </v>

204
00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.081
<v Speaker 1>reloading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always boggles the mind a little bit </v>

205
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:52.370
<v Speaker 1>to realize how quickly the Germans were </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving to get around the treaty </v>

206
00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:57.561
<v Speaker 1>restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean some historians have pushed it </v>

207
00:10:57.561 --> 00:10:57.561
<v Speaker 1>all the way back to like 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

208
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.840
<v Speaker 1>which if true would mean that the seeds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of rearmament we're already being sown </v>

209
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.910
<v Speaker 1>as the agreement to end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first World War was being concluded.</v>

210
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.170
<v Speaker 1>That's wild.</v>

211
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:16.670
<v Speaker 1>You all know that there were things </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in the Soviet Union where they </v>

212
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.581
<v Speaker 1>had hidden deals to develop weapons </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems and tactics and factories and </v>

213
00:11:19.581 --> 00:11:22.731
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff on Russian soil hidden </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the prying eyes of the people who </v>

214
00:11:22.731 --> 00:11:27.051
<v Speaker 1>would enforce these treaties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The German attitude would probably be </v>

215
00:11:27.051 --> 00:11:30.930
<v Speaker 1>that the treaties were forced upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany under false pretenses.</v>

216
00:11:30.931 --> 00:11:35.931
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of criticism you can make </v>

217
00:11:35.931 --> 00:11:35.931
<v Speaker 1>against those versailles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treaty restrictions.</v>

218
00:11:35.931 --> 00:11:35.931
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the allies,</v>

219
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before Hitler came to power,</v>

220
00:11:37.771 --> 00:11:42.771
<v Speaker 1>there were lots of negotiations about </v>
<v Speaker 1>cutting slack on some of this stuff </v>

221
00:11:42.771 --> 00:11:42.771
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

222
00:11:42.771 --> 00:11:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is,</v>

223
00:11:43.811 --> 00:11:47.560
<v Speaker 1>is that long before Hitler was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody's rearview mirror,</v>

224
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:51.370
<v Speaker 1>even in the Weimar Republic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early days,</v>

225
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:57.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already an attempt to rearm Germany </v>

226
00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:01.171
<v Speaker 1>or set the groundwork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laid the groundwork for rearmament and </v>

227
00:12:01.171 --> 00:12:04.891
<v Speaker 1>it provides an interesting what if </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario to wonder if Hitler had never </v>

228
00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:08.491
<v Speaker 1>come to power?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much of his early agenda happens </v>

229
00:12:08.491 --> 00:12:10.420
<v Speaker 1>under any German government?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

230
00:12:10.421 --> 00:12:15.421
<v Speaker 1>in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to imagine any German </v>

231
00:12:15.421 --> 00:12:17.210
<v Speaker 1>government not eventually remilitarizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the land,</v>

232
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:22.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're a Weimar republic </v>

233
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.911
<v Speaker 1>democratic ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting to wonder about the </v>

234
00:12:23.911 --> 00:12:25.090
<v Speaker 1>early stuff that Hitler did and whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>a Weimar Republic might've done it too.</v>

235
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:27.810
<v Speaker 1>And it's also intriguing to note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

236
00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:32.840
<v Speaker 1>that long before Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foundation was being laid for the </v>

237
00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.720
<v Speaker 1>rebuilding of the German military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those who don't know,</v>

238
00:12:34.721 --> 00:12:38.680
<v Speaker 1>the German military at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war was essentially I'm torn</v>

239
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:42.970
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An army that had numbered in the several</v>

240
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:47.971
<v Speaker 1>millions at one point in the field was </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduced to 100,000</v>

241
00:12:47.981 --> 00:12:52.981
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a one person at the time called them a </v>

242
00:12:52.981 --> 00:12:56.071
<v Speaker 1>police force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paramilitary is the way there somehow </v>

243
00:12:56.071 --> 00:12:58.951
<v Speaker 1>described now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically means something between </v>

244
00:12:58.951 --> 00:12:59.680
<v Speaker 1>a police force and a soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100,000</v>

245
00:12:59.681 --> 00:13:02.710
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their neighbors all had many more.</v>

246
00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.010
<v Speaker 1>All kinds of weapons systems are </v>
<v Speaker 1>prohibited.</v>

247
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:12.370
<v Speaker 1>The reason all this stuff matters is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because in this short period of time </v>

248
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:16.631
<v Speaker 1>between the two world wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans have to recreate an army </v>

249
00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:20.531
<v Speaker 1>from scratch and they can't even really </v>
<v Speaker 1>get going until the Middle Nineteen </v>

250
00:13:20.531 --> 00:13:24.821
<v Speaker 1>thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how deep do the roots of this thing </v>

251
00:13:25.041 --> 00:13:30.041
<v Speaker 1>go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you attach it to the earlier </v>

252
00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:31.250
<v Speaker 1>military traditions when you compare it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the first World War German state,</v>

253
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
<v Speaker 1>which has these deep old roots and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can trace it to to before Germany was a </v>

254
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.801
<v Speaker 1>state with the histories of several </v>
<v Speaker 1>different individual German states like </v>

255
00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Prussia in Bavaria and all these places.</v>

256
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:49.690
<v Speaker 1>The first World War German state is one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like a bodybuilder who's been </v>

257
00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:53.770
<v Speaker 1>eating right and building themselves up </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly but surely the one in the second </v>

258
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:58.151
<v Speaker 1>world war as somebody who had to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavily into steroids because of a </v>

259
00:13:58.151 --> 00:14:01.541
<v Speaker 1>terrible injury and they come into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war looking pumped up and initially </v>

260
00:14:01.541 --> 00:14:05.981
<v Speaker 1>doing good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you know something that was </v>

261
00:14:05.981 --> 00:14:07.160
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be an easy knockout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns into a slug fest.</v>

262
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.580
<v Speaker 1>If you had the legs to weather the storm</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the later rounds,</v>

263
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.270
<v Speaker 1>you know I can't help but use the boxing</v>
<v Speaker 1>analogies.</v>

264
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Can I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that sense,</v>

265
00:14:15.501 --> 00:14:17.300
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to say that both of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>armies,</v>

266
00:14:17.301 --> 00:14:22.301
<v Speaker 1>the first and Second World War German </v>
<v Speaker 1>armies are big punchers knockout </v>

267
00:14:22.301 --> 00:14:26.381
<v Speaker 1>artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Second World War One is like </v>

268
00:14:26.381 --> 00:14:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Mike Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent,</v>

269
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.480
<v Speaker 1>intimidating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome throws.</v>

270
00:14:32.481 --> 00:14:33.550
<v Speaker 1>These knockout blows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knockout,</v>

271
00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.580
<v Speaker 1>knockout people spectacularly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't take your eyes off him,</v>

272
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:44.130
<v Speaker 1>but foundationally week maybe psyche </v>
<v Speaker 1>stamina,</v>

273
00:14:44.321 --> 00:14:49.321
<v Speaker 1>all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First World War Germany a little bit </v>

274
00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:53.681
<v Speaker 1>more controlled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they're a big gambling army </v>

275
00:14:53.681 --> 00:14:56.720
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They remind me a lot more.</v>

276
00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.630
<v Speaker 1>Have a boxer like Joe Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heavyweight champion of the world in</v>

277
00:15:01.631 --> 00:15:03.100
<v Speaker 1>the 19 thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 forties,</v>

278
00:15:03.101 --> 00:15:08.101
<v Speaker 1>and end of the 19 fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis was a fantastic puncher to a </v>

279
00:15:08.101 --> 00:15:08.101
<v Speaker 1>killer,</v>

280
00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:13.440
<v Speaker 1>but a little bit more defensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more careful plotting was the way </v>

281
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.790
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad Ali described him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a little unfair,</v>

282
00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.030
<v Speaker 1>but they're not as wild as the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>world war.</v>

283
00:15:19.031 --> 00:15:24.031
<v Speaker 1>Tyson ask one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They too can knock out opponents and </v>

284
00:15:26.621 --> 00:15:29.170
<v Speaker 1>they do with regularity in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>world war,</v>

285
00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:33.100
<v Speaker 1>but the difference is is that their </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation is much more solid.</v>

286
00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.240
<v Speaker 1>They're much more stable and they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>take you into the later rounds and knock</v>

287
00:15:39.241 --> 00:15:44.241
<v Speaker 1>you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the Second World War was </v>

288
00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:47.600
<v Speaker 1>essentially over in terms of knowing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome by about mid 1943.</v>

289
00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:51.450
<v Speaker 1>That's two years before the war against </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany ended,</v>

290
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:55.200
<v Speaker 1>but everyone knew the Germans weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>winning anything two years earlier,</v>

291
00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.760
<v Speaker 1>so Tyson is defeated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just is uncertain which round he will</v>

292
00:16:00.761 --> 00:16:03.190
<v Speaker 1>actually be knocked out in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas in the first world war,</v>

293
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:08.670
<v Speaker 1>you know the Joe Lewis First World War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>German military is still throwing </v>

294
00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.000
<v Speaker 1>potential knockout blows in the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>year of the war.</v>

295
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what value I put on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's note that the German army that</v>

296
00:16:17.921 --> 00:16:22.921
<v Speaker 1>went to war in 1914 is an undefeated </v>
<v Speaker 1>force and going back almost to Napoleon </v>

297
00:16:24.751 --> 00:16:27.930
<v Speaker 1>they trace and almost unbroken string of</v>
<v Speaker 1>victories.</v>

298
00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the army in the second world war</v>
<v Speaker 1>is literally and figuratively the child </v>

299
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:33.660
<v Speaker 1>of defeat,</v>

300
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.210
<v Speaker 1>the rank and file soldiers likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have had a father who fought,</v>

301
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:43.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe grievously wounded in the first </v>

302
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.650
<v Speaker 1>world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the upper echelons of the officer corps,</v>

303
00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:50.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost to a man first world war </v>

304
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:50.630
<v Speaker 1>veterans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course the totalitarian leader at</v>

305
00:16:50.631 --> 00:16:55.631
<v Speaker 1>the apex of the leadership pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler himself was a corporal in the </v>

306
00:16:55.631 --> 00:16:59.741
<v Speaker 1>trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much did that defeat and seeing what</v>

307
00:16:59.761 --> 00:17:04.761
<v Speaker 1>they saw in that war changed them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that you could ever put a </v>

308
00:17:04.761 --> 00:17:08.991
<v Speaker 1>number on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will just say if you have to boxing </v>

309
00:17:08.991 --> 00:17:09.210
<v Speaker 1>champions facing each other and one is </v>
<v Speaker 1>undefeated and the other,</v>

310
00:17:09.211 --> 00:17:13.090
<v Speaker 1>isn't there something that helps the </v>
<v Speaker 1>undefeated fighter?</v>

311
00:17:13.091 --> 00:17:16.050
<v Speaker 1>It may be different person to person and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't tell you how much and in what</v>

312
00:17:16.051 --> 00:17:19.050
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone notices it and acknowledges</v>

313
00:17:19.051 --> 00:17:20.820
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the same is true here,</v>

314
00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:26.450
<v Speaker 1>but that's hard to make a case if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing up here as a lawyer </v>

315
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.901
<v Speaker 1>representing this point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let me represented in a way that </v>

316
00:17:29.901 --> 00:17:31.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe I can pull some evidence together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and convince you.</v>

317
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with the army's themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to the navy's the air forces </v>

318
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:38.500
<v Speaker 1>in the rest.</v>

319
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Both these armies were very similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

320
00:17:43.161 --> 00:17:47.030
<v Speaker 1>so you have to kind of compare the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are different about them.</v>

321
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Both of these armies have at core,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the magnificent German fighting soldier </v>

322
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:53.160
<v Speaker 1>at the squad level,</v>

323
00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.700
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what makes them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>good as they are.</v>

324
00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.530
<v Speaker 1>A very hard to measure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember Neil Ferguson in his book,</v>

325
00:18:02.531 --> 00:18:07.531
<v Speaker 1>a pity of war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tries to break it down to some sort of </v>

326
00:18:07.531 --> 00:18:07.531
<v Speaker 1>chart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

327
00:18:07.531 --> 00:18:08.540
<v Speaker 1>how much more deadly are the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers then,</v>

328
00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiery of other countries.</v>

329
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.030
<v Speaker 1>But remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of things working together.</v>

330
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of things that the German </v>

331
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:18.440
<v Speaker 1>military had been good at for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

332
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drill,</v>

333
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.830
<v Speaker 1>obedience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tactical efficiency coordination between</v>

334
00:18:20.831 --> 00:18:22.000
<v Speaker 1>various arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

335
00:18:22.001 --> 00:18:27.001
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same adjectives that are used about </v>

336
00:18:27.001 --> 00:18:30.481
<v Speaker 1>the German soldiers in both world wars </v>
<v Speaker 1>are adjectives that are used to describe</v>

337
00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Frederick degrades mid 18th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prussian troops and the and the German </v>

338
00:18:36.761 --> 00:18:41.761
<v Speaker 1>military tradition of both world wars is</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that can be traced back easily to </v>

339
00:18:41.761 --> 00:18:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Frederick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grades,</v>

340
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Prussia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people like to go a lot earlier </v>

341
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:50.371
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's easy to look at the military </v>

342
00:18:50.371 --> 00:18:52.771
<v Speaker 1>traditions of of 18th century Prussia </v>
<v Speaker 1>and see those infused into 20th century </v>

343
00:18:53.081 --> 00:18:56.110
<v Speaker 1>German armies and so they're comparable </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the soldier level.</v>

344
00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.230
<v Speaker 1>There are also comparable in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their tactical equipment.</v>

345
00:18:59.231 --> 00:19:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean you look at like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

346
00:19:01.061 --> 00:19:02.770
<v Speaker 1>what were the rifles like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were the machine gun?</v>

347
00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.710
<v Speaker 1>All this stuff is predictably very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the German army.</v>

348
00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:11.460
<v Speaker 1>The artillery was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these things are pretty much the </v>

349
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:11.460
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you try to figure out what would</v>

350
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:16.381
<v Speaker 1>make one less strong than the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the underpinnings and in </v>

351
00:19:16.381 --> 00:19:20.101
<v Speaker 1>this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to imagine the German army in the </v>

352
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Second World War without Nazis.</v>

353
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.390
<v Speaker 1>If you take the Nazis out of the Second </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War,</v>

354
00:19:26.391 --> 00:19:28.850
<v Speaker 1>German army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it instantly gets better.</v>

355
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:34.900
<v Speaker 1>Then I think you could compare the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still think I'd go first world war </v>

356
00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.250
<v Speaker 1>better because of the underpinnings of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the state being much more old and strong</v>

357
00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.980
<v Speaker 1>like a well constructed building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

358
00:19:39.981 --> 00:19:41.510
<v Speaker 1>whatever happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Second World War,</v>

359
00:19:41.511 --> 00:19:44.630
<v Speaker 1>German military is a rickety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hastily thrown up structure.</v>

360
00:19:44.631 --> 00:19:47.300
<v Speaker 1>If you're talking about the economy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>supports it,</v>

361
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:53.900
<v Speaker 1>every World War II buff knows that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were trying to build up the </v>

362
00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.520
<v Speaker 1>stockpile of weaponry and whatnot did </v>
<v Speaker 1>not want to go to war.</v>

363
00:19:56.521 --> 00:20:01.521
<v Speaker 1>As early as 1939,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam two's points out the economic </v>

364
00:20:01.521 --> 00:20:05.460
<v Speaker 1>realities that made Hitler decided not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to wait until the equipment and all that</v>

365
00:20:05.461 --> 00:20:08.010
<v Speaker 1>was ready for that good reasoning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>both sides.</v>

366
00:20:08.011 --> 00:20:13.011
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to hang my hat on the idea</v>

367
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:20.270
<v Speaker 1>that the fact that the Second World War </v>
<v Speaker 1>German military is infested and run by </v>

368
00:20:20.401 --> 00:20:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Nazis is what makes it inferior to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war military.</v>

369
00:20:24.331 --> 00:20:27.300
<v Speaker 1>So let's start with why this would </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter at all.</v>

370
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:33.230
<v Speaker 1>And the basic answer that covers most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these bases is that the ideological </v>

371
00:20:33.331 --> 00:20:36.990
<v Speaker 1>question now becomes at least as </v>
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

372
00:20:36.991 --> 00:20:41.991
<v Speaker 1>and I think you can easily make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument more important than the </v>

373
00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:41.991
<v Speaker 1>question of merit</v>

374
00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.840
<v Speaker 1>or technical expertise.</v>

375
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.390
<v Speaker 1>Once ideology becomes more important </v>
<v Speaker 1>than merit,</v>

376
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:54.870
<v Speaker 1>and once the Nazis begin to place people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in positions all up and down the </v>

377
00:20:56.231 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 1>leadership tree from top to bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like Stalin did in his system,</v>

378
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:06.450
<v Speaker 1>then you begin to see the impact of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are less competent on the </v>

379
00:21:06.461 --> 00:21:09.310
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that never would have gotten jobs</v>

380
00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:14.200
<v Speaker 1>in first World War Germany because there</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have been much better than they to</v>

381
00:21:14.201 --> 00:21:19.201
<v Speaker 1>occupy those positions are getting work </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Second World War Germany and it </v>

382
00:21:19.201 --> 00:21:19.480
<v Speaker 1>degrades everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

383
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.590
<v Speaker 1>let's look at the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me this.</v>

384
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:26.600
<v Speaker 1>This is the person who proves the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just maybe the highest ranking </v>

385
00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:32.200
<v Speaker 1>competent official,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless of course you include Hitler </v>

386
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:32.200
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are still,</v>

387
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.751
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people who consider Hitler some </v>

388
00:21:36.751 --> 00:21:37.630
<v Speaker 1>sort of military genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would make the case,</v>

389
00:21:37.631 --> 00:21:42.631
<v Speaker 1>and maybe this is a question for another</v>
<v Speaker 1>show that if you had Hitler transported </v>

390
00:21:42.631 --> 00:21:47.371
<v Speaker 1>back to the deliberations of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War German general staff and </v>

391
00:21:47.371 --> 00:21:49.420
<v Speaker 1>there's only 20 people that can fit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the room.</v>

392
00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:54.420
<v Speaker 1>They're having this discussion in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're only going to let the 20 best </v>

393
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.901
<v Speaker 1>strategist in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Hitler gets anywhere near </v>

394
00:21:57.901 --> 00:21:57.901
<v Speaker 1>the front of the line to even get in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

395
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:03.760
<v Speaker 1>But let's not talk about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about his second in command.</v>

396
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:09.040
<v Speaker 1>A guy who is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in charge of,</v>

397
00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:14.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could say the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointing underperforming wing of </v>

398
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:19.261
<v Speaker 1>the German military and the one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably was most responsible for a lot </v>

399
00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:24.751
<v Speaker 1>of the problems because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put a lot of weight and a lot of </v>

400
00:22:24.751 --> 00:22:27.850
<v Speaker 1>resources into the German air force and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they handed those resources,</v>

401
00:22:27.851 --> 00:22:32.851
<v Speaker 1>that responsibility and the weight of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the war in so many areas and put it on </v>

402
00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:37.771
<v Speaker 1>the shoulders of Hermann goring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy who was so incompetent at his job </v>

403
00:22:38.981 --> 00:22:43.981
<v Speaker 1>at one point that if you were sending </v>
<v Speaker 1>out commandos from the allied side,</v>

404
00:22:44.261 --> 00:22:48.610
<v Speaker 1>hit teams to take out German leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would specifically want to make sure</v>

405
00:22:48.611 --> 00:22:53.611
<v Speaker 1>you did not shoot Hermann goring because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the best things that ever </v>

406
00:22:53.611 --> 00:22:57.451
<v Speaker 1>happened to the allied war effort </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was incompetent and he would </v>

407
00:22:57.451 --> 00:22:58.690
<v Speaker 1>not have had that job in the first world</v>
<v Speaker 1>war system.</v>

408
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Now let's understand something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first world war system had it's own </v>

409
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:03.900
<v Speaker 1>problem with nepotism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were not forgiving them.</v>

410
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.600
<v Speaker 1>They're part of that tradition of blue </v>
<v Speaker 1>blooded aristocracy.</v>

411
00:23:07.601 --> 00:23:12.601
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll look at the nominal </v>

412
00:23:12.601 --> 00:23:15.001
<v Speaker 1>commanders have a lot of the first world</v>
<v Speaker 1>war armies on the German side and their </v>

413
00:23:15.001 --> 00:23:17.911
<v Speaker 1>prints this and crown prince that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those guys were decent generals </v>

414
00:23:17.911 --> 00:23:21.721
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll notice that for the ones who </v>

415
00:23:21.721 --> 00:23:24.991
<v Speaker 1>weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German military was extremely adept </v>

416
00:23:24.991 --> 00:23:28.690
<v Speaker 1>at walling off their ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>negatively impact things too much.</v>

417
00:23:28.691 --> 00:23:31.420
<v Speaker 1>And the best example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course at all,</v>

418
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:36.930
<v Speaker 1>is how the military dictatorship of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany were able to sort of isolate and</v>

419
00:23:38.711 --> 00:23:42.040
<v Speaker 1>quarantine the Kaiser himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the imperial war,</v>

420
00:23:42.041 --> 00:23:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Lord of Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

421
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.040
<v Speaker 1>sit in the corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>play with your maps and your ships.</v>

422
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.940
<v Speaker 1>We have a war to conduct and they did.</v>

423
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to do that in the Second </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War?</v>

424
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to coordinate off Hitler and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quarantine Hitler from his bad decisions</v>

425
00:23:55.611 --> 00:23:57.440
<v Speaker 1>being transmitted to the military?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

426
00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Because it's an ideological state and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideology plays as larger role or a </v>

427
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:05.690
<v Speaker 1>larger role in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And ideology by the way,</v>

428
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.930
<v Speaker 1>is absolutely key for understanding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Second World War at all.</v>

429
00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Adam two's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wonderful economic historian,</v>

430
00:24:11.421 --> 00:24:14.150
<v Speaker 1>makes these wonderful points in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

431
00:24:14.151 --> 00:24:15.500
<v Speaker 1>and I'll have to quote a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

432
00:24:15.501 --> 00:24:20.501
<v Speaker 1>but he points out essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it occurred to me when I read the </v>

433
00:24:20.501 --> 00:24:20.501
<v Speaker 1>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

434
00:24:20.501 --> 00:24:20.501
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is wild.</v>

435
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Basically my words put in his mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

436
00:24:23.911 --> 00:24:28.911
<v Speaker 1>it's the question is what would happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>if a major nation state got taken over </v>

437
00:24:28.911 --> 00:24:32.861
<v Speaker 1>by a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a leader who was a fanatical </v>

438
00:24:32.861 --> 00:24:34.940
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theorist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And saw the world strictly through their</v>

439
00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:38.840
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy lens and then acted upon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

440
00:24:38.841 --> 00:24:39.920
<v Speaker 1>what they thought they saw.</v>

441
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.920
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's imagine that the person running a </v>

442
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.741
<v Speaker 1>major nation state believes that aliens </v>
<v Speaker 1>from outer space had been controlling </v>

443
00:24:47.741 --> 00:24:52.630
<v Speaker 1>nations and world leaders for 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they get into power and they </v>

444
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.800
<v Speaker 1>start acting as if that's what's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on,</v>

445
00:24:54.801 --> 00:24:59.801
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't base our decisions on what </v>

446
00:24:59.801 --> 00:24:59.801
<v Speaker 1>these countries say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're puppets for the aliens.</v>

447
00:24:59.801 --> 00:24:59.801
<v Speaker 1>It's Kooky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

448
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.660
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reminded me something we all know,</v>

449
00:25:02.661 --> 00:25:07.661
<v Speaker 1>but we tend to forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially we war gamers will sit down </v>

450
00:25:07.661 --> 00:25:09.260
<v Speaker 1>there and we're thinking about this tank</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that gun and you forget the ideology</v>

451
00:25:09.261 --> 00:25:11.990
<v Speaker 1>that that's pushing these armies forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>to begin with.</v>

452
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Hitler is a fanatical conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorist,</v>

453
00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.680
<v Speaker 1>but he's not thinking of space aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's thinking of Jews running the world.</v>

454
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:22.410
<v Speaker 1>And there's a tendency to think yes </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked,</v>

455
00:25:22.411 --> 00:25:23.180
<v Speaker 1>she asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

456
00:25:23.181 --> 00:25:24.920
<v Speaker 1>these other things matter until you </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that,</v>

457
00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.100
<v Speaker 1>and this is what was so good at in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>2006 work,</v>

458
00:25:28.101 --> 00:25:29.210
<v Speaker 1>the wages of destruction.</v>

459
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand that it explained</v>

460
00:25:31.571 --> 00:25:35.990
<v Speaker 1>so much of the crazy stuff that they did</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when I was growing up,</v>

461
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.660
<v Speaker 1>this was still the end of the era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in the United States.</v>

462
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:43.830
<v Speaker 1>The classic thing to say about Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that he was crazy and then you'd </v>

463
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:44.390
<v Speaker 1>read about what they would do and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would go,</v>

464
00:25:44.391 --> 00:25:45.140
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

465
00:25:45.141 --> 00:25:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Only crazy man would do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

466
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:51.910
<v Speaker 1>two's points out that only if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider these fanatical conspiracy </v>

467
00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:52.460
<v Speaker 1>theorists to be crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would that work?</v>

468
00:25:52.461 --> 00:25:57.461
<v Speaker 1>Because Hitler's got a logical plan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually acting logically,</v>

469
00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.400
<v Speaker 1>but only if you're able to see things </v>
<v Speaker 1>through that same fanatical conspiracy </v>

470
00:26:04.191 --> 00:26:06.500
<v Speaker 1>theorist lens he's looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

471
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:11.950
<v Speaker 1>the classic stupid maneuver of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitlarian regime in the Second World </v>

472
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:13.130
<v Speaker 1>War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there anything worse?</v>

473
00:26:13.131 --> 00:26:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Everybody always likes to say attacking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>

474
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:19.721
<v Speaker 1>which was bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but remember when Hitler was already at </v>

475
00:26:19.721 --> 00:26:24.341
<v Speaker 1>war with Britain and Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he then declared war on the United </v>

476
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:25.250
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

477
00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:30.050
<v Speaker 1>The United States didn't declare war on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany first and there's a great.</v>

478
00:26:30.051 --> 00:26:35.051
<v Speaker 1>What if scenario that some people play </v>
<v Speaker 1>with about what would have happened if </v>

479
00:26:35.051 --> 00:26:38.831
<v Speaker 1>Hitler hadn't declared war on the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States at all because there was still a </v>

480
00:26:38.831 --> 00:26:42.971
<v Speaker 1>lot of isolationist in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people that would not have </v>

481
00:26:42.971 --> 00:26:43.230
<v Speaker 1>wanted to go to war with Germany would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been able say,</v>

482
00:26:43.231 --> 00:26:48.231
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't do anything to us or at the </v>

483
00:26:48.231 --> 00:26:48.231
<v Speaker 1>Japanese bombed us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Germans didn't.</v>

484
00:26:48.231 --> 00:26:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Interesting counterfactual to play with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their kettler takes it right out of </v>

485
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.550
<v Speaker 1>everyone's hands and declares war on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>

486
00:26:53.551 --> 00:26:55.530
<v Speaker 1>and when I was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just thought crazy,</v>

487
00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:02.250
<v Speaker 1>but his points out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam points out that not if you see the </v>

488
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:06.811
<v Speaker 1>world controlled by a cabal of Jews who </v>
<v Speaker 1>use whole nation states is they're </v>

489
00:27:08.471 --> 00:27:11.680
<v Speaker 1>puppets to do their bidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the great,</v>

490
00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:16.980
<v Speaker 1>weird ironies of Nazi-ism is that Hitler</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw Stalin's Soviet Union as a Jewish </v>

491
00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Bolshevik Communist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In his mind,</v>

492
00:27:22.391 --> 00:27:24.340
<v Speaker 1>communism is Judaism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're mixed up.</v>

493
00:27:24.341 --> 00:27:25.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all the same,</v>

494
00:27:25.151 --> 00:27:30.151
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a main Jewish stronghold to </v>

495
00:27:30.151 --> 00:27:32.401
<v Speaker 1>Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Hitler also thinks that the United </v>

496
00:27:32.401 --> 00:27:37.290
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's democracy and freedom and </v>

497
00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:38.020
<v Speaker 1>capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is also somehow a sign of Jewishness,</v>

498
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.960
<v Speaker 1>that that's also another one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish puppets.</v>

499
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:46.590
<v Speaker 1>If you're fighting Jews and not nation </v>
<v Speaker 1>states will then declaring war on the </v>

500
00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:52.860
<v Speaker 1>United States if you think they're this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish puppet all of a sudden makes </v>

501
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.211
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what two's kind of woke me up to is </v>

502
00:27:56.211 --> 00:27:58.540
<v Speaker 1>that if you're operating with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory as your guide,</v>

503
00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.760
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States is just another one of</v>

504
00:28:00.761 --> 00:28:04.890
<v Speaker 1>these alien controlled countries that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the space aliens are using against us.</v>

505
00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:06.610
<v Speaker 1>You might as well go after him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

506
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:10.950
<v Speaker 1>here's the way Adam two's encourages us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to think about,</v>

507
00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:16.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that these Nazis worldview </v>

508
00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:16.660
<v Speaker 1>explains a lot</v>

509
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:17.770
<v Speaker 2>quote,</v>

510
00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:23.420
<v Speaker 1>President Roosevelt was identified as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the chief agent of a worldwide Jewish </v>

511
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.490
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy bent on the destruction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>national socialist Germany.</v>

512
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:31.760
<v Speaker 1>It was no coincidence that Hitler's </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous threat of annihilation of 30th </v>

513
00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:35.541
<v Speaker 1>January 1939 came as a direct response </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Roosevelt state of the Union address.</v>

514
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.040
<v Speaker 1>The United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as everyone understood,</v>

515
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:40.800
<v Speaker 1>was the key to deciding the balance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the arms race.</v>

516
00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:43.950
<v Speaker 1>It Britain and France could count firmly</v>
<v Speaker 1>on American aid.</v>

517
00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Their position would be well nigh </v>
<v Speaker 1>unassailable,</v>

518
00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.100
<v Speaker 1>but the position of the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>was precariously balanced.</v>

519
00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Whilst Roosevelt led the rhetorical </v>
<v Speaker 1>assault against Hitler and encouraged </v>

520
00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

521
00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:59.811
<v Speaker 1>and Poland in their resistance to Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>expansionism isolationist currents in </v>

522
00:28:59.811 --> 00:29:01.110
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're still strong.</v>

523
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.510
<v Speaker 1>Hitler in the rest of the Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership.</v>

524
00:29:03.511 --> 00:29:08.511
<v Speaker 1>He writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could not help but interpret this </v>

525
00:29:08.511 --> 00:29:10.440
<v Speaker 1>complex situation through the dark haze </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Manichaean antisemitism.</v>

526
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:15.740
<v Speaker 1>For them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was obvious that it was Jewish </v>

527
00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:18.201
<v Speaker 1>elements in Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 1>London and Paris bent implacably on the </v>

528
00:29:18.201 --> 00:29:21.981
<v Speaker 1>destruction of Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're tightening the international </v>

529
00:29:21.981 --> 00:29:25.191
<v Speaker 1>encirclement and it was this paranoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of menace that precipitated </v>

530
00:29:25.191 --> 00:29:29.121
<v Speaker 1>Hitler's decision to launch a strike </v>
<v Speaker 1>against Poland and then against the </v>

531
00:29:29.121 --> 00:29:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Western coalition that continued to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand obstinately in his way and quote,</v>

532
00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.130
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

533
00:29:36.131 --> 00:29:41.080
<v Speaker 1>The Germans in both world wars did </v>
<v Speaker 1>poorly because they were tactically.</v>

534
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time it was the grand </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy stuff.</v>

535
00:29:44.681 --> 00:29:49.681
<v Speaker 1>It was deciding for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which countries to go to war with and </v>

536
00:29:49.681 --> 00:29:53.071
<v Speaker 1>which wars to fight or not to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That they really screwed up in and in </v>

537
00:29:53.071 --> 00:29:57.181
<v Speaker 1>the Second World War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason for declaring wars and </v>

538
00:29:57.181 --> 00:29:59.740
<v Speaker 1>accruing more and more enemies was </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologically based.</v>

539
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the doom of the German military,</v>

540
00:30:03.371 --> 00:30:06.280
<v Speaker 1>no matter how good it might have been on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the battlefield,</v>

541
00:30:06.281 --> 00:30:11.281
<v Speaker 1>was sealed by the politicians who put </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in wars that no one could hope to </v>

542
00:30:11.281 --> 00:30:15.511
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's getting a little off the </v>

543
00:30:15.511 --> 00:30:20.201
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about how the Nazis made the </v>

544
00:30:20.201 --> 00:30:24.551
<v Speaker 1>German army weaker in the Second World </v>
<v Speaker 1>War and the difference that you would </v>

545
00:30:24.551 --> 00:30:25.580
<v Speaker 1>have had in a system like the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War Germany,</v>

546
00:30:25.581 --> 00:30:28.160
<v Speaker 1>that was more merit based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say it was merit based,</v>

547
00:30:28.161 --> 00:30:33.161
<v Speaker 1>but more merit based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start with the idea that you have all </v>

548
00:30:33.161 --> 00:30:36.191
<v Speaker 1>these Nazis in key positions that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>incompetent or untrained or non expert.</v>

549
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:39.620
<v Speaker 1>This is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way a bug.</v>

550
00:30:39.621 --> 00:30:44.621
<v Speaker 1>This is a feature as Hitler sees it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are lots of critiques.</v>

551
00:30:45.751 --> 00:30:48.300
<v Speaker 1>One could pull off the shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about,</v>

552
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:53.830
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these people have access to </v>

553
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:55.671
<v Speaker 1>grind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so take everything that these ex Nazi </v>

554
00:30:55.671 --> 00:30:55.671
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

555
00:30:55.671 --> 00:30:58.620
<v Speaker 1>With a grain of salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in his famous book,</v>

556
00:30:58.621 --> 00:31:00.720
<v Speaker 1>inside the Third Reich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which may be,</v>

557
00:31:00.721 --> 00:31:05.721
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the closest account you'll ever </v>

558
00:31:05.721 --> 00:31:06.300
<v Speaker 1>get of the Nazi situation</v>

559
00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.370
<v Speaker 1>originally his architect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the minister of armaments,</v>

560
00:31:10.371 --> 00:31:14.060
<v Speaker 1>Albert Speer wrote his memoirs after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>war and when you read them,</v>

561
00:31:14.061 --> 00:31:19.061
<v Speaker 1>he'll say things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like reading churchill stuff </v>

562
00:31:19.061 --> 00:31:19.061
<v Speaker 1>because instead of saying they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they said it's,</v>

563
00:31:19.061 --> 00:31:19.790
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he said,</v>

564
00:31:19.791 --> 00:31:22.160
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of the he says is Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

565
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:23.270
<v Speaker 1>so in Albert speer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his book,</v>

566
00:31:23.271 --> 00:31:28.271
<v Speaker 1>he talks about Hitler's tendency to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in positions of authority and </v>

567
00:31:29.751 --> 00:31:34.751
<v Speaker 1>great importance in the survival of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state who had never done anything like </v>

568
00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:36.680
<v Speaker 1>what their jobs were going to require in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past,</v>

569
00:31:36.681 --> 00:31:38.240
<v Speaker 1>including spear himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

570
00:31:38.241 --> 00:31:43.241
<v Speaker 1>A guy who had become Hitler's friend </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was an architect who was </v>

571
00:31:43.241 --> 00:31:45.320
<v Speaker 1>going to design Hitler's new Berlin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Hitler takes a liking to him and all</v>

572
00:31:45.321 --> 00:31:46.850
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden tells the architect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

573
00:31:46.851 --> 00:31:47.780
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

574
00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:51.290
<v Speaker 1>the armaments minister with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience at all.</v>

575
00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Here's the way spirit described it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quote one can only wonder at the </v>

576
00:31:56.290 --> 00:32:00.041
<v Speaker 1>recklessness and the frivolity with </v>
<v Speaker 1>which Hitler appointed me to one of </v>

577
00:32:00.041 --> 00:32:03.680
<v Speaker 1>those three or four ministries on which </v>
<v Speaker 1>the existence of estate depended.</v>

578
00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.040
<v Speaker 1>I was a complete outsider to the army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the party,</v>

579
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:10.760
<v Speaker 1>and to industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never in my life had anything to do with</v>

580
00:32:10.761 --> 00:32:12.320
<v Speaker 1>military weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

581
00:32:12.321 --> 00:32:15.650
<v Speaker 1>I'd never been a soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And up to the time of my appointment had</v>

582
00:32:15.651 --> 00:32:20.651
<v Speaker 1>never even used a rifle as a hunter to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be sure it was in keeping with Hitler's </v>

583
00:32:20.651 --> 00:32:25.190
<v Speaker 1>dilettantism that he preferred to choose</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonspecialists as his associates.</v>

584
00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.640
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd already appointed a wine salesmen,</v>

585
00:32:28.641 --> 00:32:31.790
<v Speaker 1>as his foreign minister is party </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher as,</v>

586
00:32:31.791 --> 00:32:36.791
<v Speaker 1>as minister for eastern affairs and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>erstwhile fighter pilot as overseer of </v>

587
00:32:36.791 --> 00:32:38.330
<v Speaker 1>the entire economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

588
00:32:38.331 --> 00:32:42.380
<v Speaker 1>he was picking an of all people to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>his minister of armaments.</v>

589
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Undoubtedly Hitler preferred to fill </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions of leadership with layman all </v>

590
00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:52.391
<v Speaker 1>his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd respected but distrusted </v>

591
00:32:52.391 --> 00:32:54.761
<v Speaker 1>professionals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to quote any names or professional </v>

592
00:32:54.761 --> 00:32:54.890
<v Speaker 1>how marsh locked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was fantastic.</v>

593
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.880
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

594
00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.760
<v Speaker 1>a perfect example of the kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

595
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were merit based.</v>

596
00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the perfect example that should prove </v>

597
00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.471
<v Speaker 1>the rule of what a spear was just saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the guy who was second in command in</v>

598
00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.940
<v Speaker 1>the Nazi regime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the famous Hermann goring,</v>

599
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.470
<v Speaker 1>head of the Luftwaffe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a right,</v>

600
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:21.880
<v Speaker 1>arguably the most underperforming branch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the German military</v>

601
00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.540
<v Speaker 1>goring story of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is fascinating.</v>

602
00:33:25.541 --> 00:33:30.541
<v Speaker 1>He was a dashing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>handsome fighter pilot in the first </v>

603
00:33:30.541 --> 00:33:32.320
<v Speaker 1>World War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shall we say,</v>

604
00:33:32.321 --> 00:33:37.140
<v Speaker 1>gone to seed by the second between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wars.</v>

605
00:33:37.141 --> 00:33:42.141
<v Speaker 1>He was one of Hitler's comrades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took a bullet in the groin area during </v>

606
00:33:42.141 --> 00:33:46.701
<v Speaker 1>the early Nazi marches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pain of that was what was blamed on </v>

607
00:33:46.701 --> 00:33:51.441
<v Speaker 1>him becoming a morphine opioid addict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

608
00:33:51.481 --> 00:33:52.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the way,</v>

609
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:58.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great tank General Hind Scuderi in </v>

610
00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:01.550
<v Speaker 1>describes a goring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand another thing </v>

611
00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:01.980
<v Speaker 1>that made that the Nazi state so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>weaker,</v>

612
00:34:01.981 --> 00:34:06.981
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the first World War state is the </v>

613
00:34:06.981 --> 00:34:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Nazi state was full of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the most.</v>

614
00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:08.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

615
00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:10.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Hitler is Taylor Swift,</v>

616
00:34:10.471 --> 00:34:11.340
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taylor Swift,</v>

617
00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:12.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

618
00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:14.400
<v Speaker 1>his little gang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his entourage,</v>

619
00:34:14.401 --> 00:34:18.810
<v Speaker 1>we were a bunch of backbiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I you can't even describe the drama,</v>

620
00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:24.660
<v Speaker 1>but hind spewed Arion describes goring </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's just the most one.</v>

621
00:34:24.970 --> 00:34:27.820
<v Speaker 1>The Nazis are the most in the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

622
00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Perverse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful,</v>

623
00:34:29.321 --> 00:34:30.640
<v Speaker 1>colorful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awful.</v>

624
00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:33.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can't even the adjectives are</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even there.</v>

625
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Here's what hines good Erin writes </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

626
00:34:35.141 --> 00:34:38.170
<v Speaker 1>goring who's in charge of the German air</v>
<v Speaker 1>force,</v>

627
00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:43.380
<v Speaker 1>the arm that is receiving an inordinate </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of the state's resources because </v>

628
00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:47.491
<v Speaker 1>it's seen as this cutting edge thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can win you the war and then it's </v>

629
00:34:47.491 --> 00:34:48.880
<v Speaker 1>going to underperform time and time </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

630
00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Here's what one of the great tank </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorists of all time,</v>

631
00:34:52.241 --> 00:34:55.570
<v Speaker 1>General Heinz good area and wrote in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this post war memoirs of Goring,</v>

632
00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.460
<v Speaker 1>and you can just feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

633
00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even sure what the emotion is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dripping off the page.</v>

634
00:35:01.061 --> 00:35:02.320
<v Speaker 1>You tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He writes,</v>

635
00:35:02.321 --> 00:35:04.230
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>

636
00:35:04.231 --> 00:35:08.490
<v Speaker 1>however goring had seen the young German</v>
<v Speaker 1>air force through its teething troubles,</v>

637
00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.450
<v Speaker 1>he surrendered more and more to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>charms of newly one power.</v>

638
00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:16.620
<v Speaker 1>He adopted a futile manner of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>collecting decorations,</v>

639
00:35:16.621 --> 00:35:21.621
<v Speaker 1>precious stones and antiques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>building his famous country seat Karen </v>

640
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Hall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrating with visible results on </v>

641
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:27.330
<v Speaker 1>the joys of the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just means he's getting fat.</v>

642
00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:33.440
<v Speaker 1>He continues on one occasion while sunk </v>
<v Speaker 1>in contemplation of old pictures in an </v>

643
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.560
<v Speaker 1>east,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prussia and castle,</v>

644
00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 1>he suddenly cried out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is goring magnificent.</v>

645
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.060
<v Speaker 1>I too am a man of the renaissance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I adore splendor,</v>

646
00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:44.760
<v Speaker 1>good area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and continues quote.</v>

647
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:50.190
<v Speaker 1>His style of dress grew ever more </v>
<v Speaker 1>eccentric at Karen Hall or while </v>

648
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:54.721
<v Speaker 1>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he adopted the costume of the ancient </v>

649
00:35:54.721 --> 00:35:56.800
<v Speaker 1>two tons and went on duty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His uniform was always unorthodox.</v>

650
00:35:57.010 --> 00:36:01.330
<v Speaker 1>He either wore red boots of Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>leather with Golden Spurs,</v>

651
00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:06.480
<v Speaker 1>an item of dress scarcely essential to </v>
<v Speaker 1>an aviator or else he would appear at </v>

652
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Hitler's conferences in long trousers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and black patent leather pumps.</v>

653
00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.510
<v Speaker 1>He was strongly scented and he painted </v>
<v Speaker 1>his face.</v>

654
00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:18.840
<v Speaker 1>His fingers were covered with heavy </v>
<v Speaker 1>rings in which were set the many large </v>

655
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:20.410
<v Speaker 1>gems that he loved to display and quote</v>

656
00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Kadarian taking a shot at going there </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a perhaps a little cross dressing </v>

657
00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.400
<v Speaker 1>goes a little beyond the metrosexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>

658
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.140
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

659
00:36:32.141 --> 00:36:37.141
<v Speaker 1>that's just one of the wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypocrisy of the Nazis is that they </v>

660
00:36:37.141 --> 00:36:40.111
<v Speaker 1>always had a strain of people doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that and there's nothing </v>

661
00:36:40.111 --> 00:36:43.261
<v Speaker 1>wrong with that unless of course you </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypocritically make them one of the top </v>

662
00:36:43.261 --> 00:36:44.320
<v Speaker 1>targets that you send to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration camps.</v>

663
00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:49.620
<v Speaker 1>The Nazis were extremely hard on sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>minorities and the fact that they have </v>

664
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:53.560
<v Speaker 1>people in them that probably could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>passed for some just makes it extra,</v>

665
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.770
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypocritical.</v>

666
00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Now once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

667
00:36:59.631 --> 00:37:01.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does this have to do with the army?</v>

668
00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't a guy in the field with the </v>

669
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:06.530
<v Speaker 1>weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is.</v>

670
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:08.240
<v Speaker 1>They're all interconnected in ways that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't separate.</v>

671
00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:13.540
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Albert speer gives an account of </v>

672
00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:18.230
<v Speaker 1>Hermann goring shouting down a German </v>
<v Speaker 1>general who was explaining to him really</v>

673
00:37:18.231 --> 00:37:21.170
<v Speaker 1>important things that will affect what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to the German army,</v>

674
00:37:21.171 --> 00:37:23.210
<v Speaker 1>which will affect what happens on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battlefield.</v>

00:37:56.140 --> 00:38:01.140
<v Speaker 1>quote in such disputes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>General Thomas could expect no support </v>

685
00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:05.011
<v Speaker 1>from his chief General Keitel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was only too glad to escape being </v>

686
00:38:05.011 --> 00:38:08.971
<v Speaker 1>bullied by goring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The well-conceived economic plan of the </v>

687
00:38:08.971 --> 00:38:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Armaments Office of the High Command of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the armed forces was never carried out.</v>

688
00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:14.200
<v Speaker 1>But as I had already realized by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>

689
00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:18.220
<v Speaker 1>goring did nothing about these problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever he did do anything,</v>

690
00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:23.340
<v Speaker 1>he usually created total confusion since</v>
<v Speaker 1>he never took the trouble to work </v>

691
00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:27.061
<v Speaker 1>through the problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but made his decisions on the basis of </v>

692
00:38:27.061 --> 00:38:27.310
<v Speaker 1>impulsive inspirations and quote</v>

693
00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:34.010
<v Speaker 1>goring's one of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see this amongst a lot of the </v>

694
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Nazi officials were theoretically on </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper.</v>

695
00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:37.930
<v Speaker 1>Goring is not a bad guy to run the air </v>
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>

696
00:38:37.931 --> 00:38:40.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean with his qualifications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>

697
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:44.950
<v Speaker 1>is those qualifications were created at </v>
<v Speaker 1>a time when goring was a different guy.</v>

698
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:51.480
<v Speaker 1>He's a hardcore addict by this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his decisions concerning the </v>

699
00:38:53.801 --> 00:38:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Luftwaffe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

700
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:59.510
<v Speaker 1>are catastrophic if you're German mixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in with these Nazi officials put in </v>

701
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.260
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in the army for ideological reasons</v>

702
00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:10.740
<v Speaker 1>are hardcore professional merit based </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in all these services who are </v>

703
00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:15.601
<v Speaker 1>horrified when his generals helmet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forester set of goring quote.</v>

704
00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the Reich's Marshall not off </v>
<v Speaker 1>in mid conference.</v>

705
00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:26.610
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the conferences went on too long and </v>

706
00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:29.551
<v Speaker 1>the morphine wore off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the commander in chief of our </v>

707
00:39:29.551 --> 00:39:30.640
<v Speaker 1>air force exclamation point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>End Quote.</v>

708
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:37.320
<v Speaker 1>So imagine this goring question up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the chain of command and how much </v>

709
00:39:37.601 --> 00:39:38.650
<v Speaker 1>that affects everything.</v>

710
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:43.650
<v Speaker 1>And if you took those Nazi officials out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and put people that were more merit </v>

711
00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:48.271
<v Speaker 1>based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not get utopian here from the </v>

712
00:39:48.271 --> 00:39:50.731
<v Speaker 1>first world war sort of standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have a better army in the Second </v>

713
00:39:50.731 --> 00:39:54.390
<v Speaker 1>World War in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's discuss some of the other </v>

714
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.700
<v Speaker 1>things besides the Merritt question that</v>
<v Speaker 1>play into this.</v>

715
00:39:54.701 --> 00:39:57.580
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I'm making my case here,</v>

716
00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:03.060
<v Speaker 1>the Nazi ideology of racial exclusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and superiority makes the army weaker.</v>

717
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:11.790
<v Speaker 1>If you go to or some of the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>graveyards from the first World War in </v>

718
00:40:12.281 --> 00:40:17.281
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will come across a every now and </v>

719
00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:17.281
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with regularity,</v>

720
00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:19.030
<v Speaker 1>a German grave that has a star of David </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

721
00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:21.160
<v Speaker 1>The reasons are obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

722
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:26.050
<v Speaker 1>That is a German Jew who fell in service</v>
<v Speaker 1>to his country,</v>

723
00:40:26.051 --> 00:40:28.210
<v Speaker 1>a patriotic Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the time period.</v>

724
00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:32.740
<v Speaker 1>They were everywhere from the rank and </v>
<v Speaker 1>file soldiery to the,</v>

725
00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:36.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist bankers,</v>

726
00:40:36.251 --> 00:40:38.710
<v Speaker 1>industrialists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>business people.</v>

727
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

728
00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:43.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a long list of people who helped </v>
<v Speaker 1>the German war effort in the first world</v>

729
00:40:43.301 --> 00:40:45.490
<v Speaker 1>war as loyal Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

730
00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.670
<v Speaker 1>to the Kaiser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Nazi ideology,</v>

731
00:40:48.671 --> 00:40:51.580
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns the state against those people.</v>

732
00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:54.520
<v Speaker 1>And whereas you had good Germans helping</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state,</v>

733
00:40:54.521 --> 00:40:58.030
<v Speaker 1>now you have an enemy within the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that happens of course,</v>

734
00:40:58.031 --> 00:41:03.031
<v Speaker 1>as you see a brain drain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Albert Einstein will be just one of </v>

735
00:41:03.031 --> 00:41:04.300
<v Speaker 1>the people who leaves Germany as times </v>
<v Speaker 1>get tough.</v>

736
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:06.310
<v Speaker 1>He will famously come over to the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

737
00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:11.400
<v Speaker 1>send that letter to President Roosevelt </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying it might be possible to harness </v>

738
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:11.400
<v Speaker 1>the power of the atom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

739
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:11.400
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

740
00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the first world war,</v>

741
00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Albert Einstein stays in Germany and </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked his physics calculations for the </v>

742
00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Kaiser's regime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Likely.</v>

743
00:41:20.321 --> 00:41:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

744
00:41:23.021 --> 00:41:28.021
<v Speaker 1>but now you have this people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>would've been helping the war effort </v>

745
00:41:28.021 --> 00:41:28.390
<v Speaker 1>that now you have to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>at first get rid of.</v>

746
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:31.360
<v Speaker 1>And there was a balance of payment </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that was complicating matters.</v>

747
00:41:31.361 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 1>But by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just basically means at some point in</v>

748
00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:36.140
<v Speaker 1>the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at a Germany that really,</v>

749
00:41:36.141 --> 00:41:41.141
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really needs to allocate its resources </v>

750
00:41:41.141 --> 00:41:41.660
<v Speaker 1>carefully and wisely and yet because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ideology,</v>

751
00:41:41.661 --> 00:41:46.310
<v Speaker 1>have to apportion a certain amount to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wiping out this ethnic group.</v>

752
00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of many,</v>

753
00:41:47.631 --> 00:41:52.631
<v Speaker 1>but the Jews most prominently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you had your Gypsies and you had </v>

754
00:41:52.631 --> 00:41:52.820
<v Speaker 1>your poles and you had your Russians and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had your.</v>

755
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:54.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the list goes on and on and you had your</v>

756
00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:57.200
<v Speaker 1>homosexuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had your priest and all of them have</v>

757
00:41:57.201 --> 00:42:01.610
<v Speaker 1>to be warehoused and exploited and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

758
00:42:01.611 --> 00:42:06.611
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that takes resources from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>war effort and why are they doing that </v>

759
00:42:06.611 --> 00:42:06.611
<v Speaker 1>again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

760
00:42:06.611 --> 00:42:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's switch to what the ideology means </v>

761
00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:14.931
<v Speaker 1>in terms of your commanders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both World War saw the traditional high </v>

762
00:42:15.211 --> 00:42:19.740
<v Speaker 1>standards of German general ship upheld </v>
<v Speaker 1>great generals in both wars,</v>

763
00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:22.020
<v Speaker 1>but in the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>

764
00:42:22.021 --> 00:42:24.990
<v Speaker 1>if you did a good job commanding troops </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you were a winner,</v>

765
00:42:24.991 --> 00:42:26.370
<v Speaker 1>you were commanding troops</v>

766
00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:32.010
<v Speaker 1>in the Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much the Nazis like you or feel that</v>

767
00:42:32.181 --> 00:42:37.181
<v Speaker 1>you are loyal to them plays a part in </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you get an important </v>

768
00:42:37.181 --> 00:42:41.141
<v Speaker 1>role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were guys like Gudera and who we </v>

769
00:42:41.141 --> 00:42:43.811
<v Speaker 1>just quoted that were sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>sidelined because they weren't </v>

770
00:42:43.811 --> 00:42:45.170
<v Speaker 1>ideologically supportive or pure enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

771
00:42:45.171 --> 00:42:50.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know that a decent number of </v>

772
00:42:50.171 --> 00:42:50.171
<v Speaker 1>German generals were killed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>regime,</v>

773
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:52.030
<v Speaker 1>the Desert Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when Rama,</v>

774
00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.690
<v Speaker 1>one of their great ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

775
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Patent thought he was one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

776
00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.400
<v Speaker 1>What did they do to him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They forced him to commit suicide.</v>

777
00:42:58.401 --> 00:43:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ideological problems again?</v>

778
00:43:02.211 --> 00:43:05.210
<v Speaker 1>So not only is it not merit based in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some ways,</v>

779
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:10.630
<v Speaker 1>but if the people who do deserve those </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs don't conform to the ideology </v>

780
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:11.450
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gone too.</v>

781
00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:15.750
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the first World War German military</v>

782
00:43:15.751 --> 00:43:16.770
<v Speaker 1>better than the second.</v>

783
00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk economics for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without getting too deeply into it,</v>

784
00:43:21.511 --> 00:43:22.710
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't want me to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

785
00:43:22.711 --> 00:43:24.900
<v Speaker 1>that's where I'll start making some </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes.</v>

786
00:43:24.901 --> 00:43:29.901
<v Speaker 1>But by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis had their own theories on </v>

787
00:43:29.901 --> 00:43:29.901
<v Speaker 1>economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is well understood.</v>

788
00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:32.190
<v Speaker 1>In the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were more,</v>

789
00:43:32.191 --> 00:43:35.520
<v Speaker 1>shall we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orthodox on their economics.</v>

790
00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:41.120
<v Speaker 1>The Germans were very much in the second</v>
<v Speaker 1>world war and we described steroids </v>

791
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:41.730
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a bad way to put it.</v>

792
00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leveraging their economy for the short </v>

793
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:50.031
<v Speaker 1>term is another way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's another reason why they were more </v>

794
00:43:50.031 --> 00:43:53.121
<v Speaker 1>like Mike Tyson and they're front </v>
<v Speaker 1>loading their power and if the fight </v>

795
00:43:53.121 --> 00:43:54.240
<v Speaker 1>goes into the later rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they in trouble and it did,</v>

796
00:43:54.241 --> 00:43:59.241
<v Speaker 1>and they were in the first world war </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a better understanding of </v>

797
00:43:59.241 --> 00:44:03.801
<v Speaker 1>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter people at the helm who were not </v>

798
00:44:03.801 --> 00:44:06.141
<v Speaker 1>blinded by ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did better with what they had </v>

799
00:44:06.141 --> 00:44:06.141
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>

800
00:44:06.141 --> 00:44:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at how the ideology boxed the </v>

801
00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:15.090
<v Speaker 1>German government in the Second World </v>
<v Speaker 1>War from any sort of outcome that wasn't</v>

802
00:44:15.431 --> 00:44:20.431
<v Speaker 1>a total catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at the performances of the </v>

803
00:44:20.431 --> 00:44:23.830
<v Speaker 1>two armies and what they did right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The German army from the first world war</v>

804
00:44:23.831 --> 00:44:28.831
<v Speaker 1>from the Kaiser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those guys are fighting a two front war </v>

805
00:44:28.831 --> 00:44:32.940
<v Speaker 1>from day one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worst nightmare of any central </v>

806
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:32.940
<v Speaker 1>continental state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

807
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.250
<v Speaker 1>You have Russians in the east,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French and British in the West.</v>

808
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:38.400
<v Speaker 1>How do you deal with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Year by year,</v>

809
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:42.330
<v Speaker 1>the Germans in the first world war went </v>
<v Speaker 1>around knocking out their enemies.</v>

810
00:44:42.331 --> 00:44:44.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knocked Russia out of the war.</v>

811
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.220
<v Speaker 1>How'd they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

812
00:44:47.221 --> 00:44:52.221
<v Speaker 1>their plan was to hurt them and then go </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get a settlement with them and take </v>

813
00:44:52.221 --> 00:44:53.760
<v Speaker 1>as much of a deal as they could get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

814
00:44:53.761 --> 00:44:55.260
<v Speaker 1>They got one of the great treaties of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>

815
00:44:55.261 --> 00:44:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Breslow task right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Famously in Germany's favor.</v>

816
00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Why in Germany of the Second World War </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that?</v>

817
00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean they had a lot more going for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

818
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:07.950
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have to fight a two front </v>
<v Speaker 1>war until 1943.</v>

819
00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:13.490
<v Speaker 1>You're knock France out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they did with a Mike Tyson like </v>

820
00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:18.220
<v Speaker 1>spectacular knockout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not fighting in any front war for</v>

821
00:45:18.221 --> 00:45:23.221
<v Speaker 1>a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you fight the Soviet Union without </v>

822
00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:24.610
<v Speaker 1>having to worry about anyone on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>western flank there on the continent.</v>

823
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:30.510
<v Speaker 1>Perfect situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by 1942 perhaps maybe 19,</v>

824
00:45:30.581 --> 00:45:33.910
<v Speaker 1>43,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've lost on the eastern front and the</v>

825
00:45:33.911 --> 00:45:36.400
<v Speaker 1>second front is just opening up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

826
00:45:36.401 --> 00:45:37.000
<v Speaker 1>in Italy.</v>

827
00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:39.350
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

828
00:45:39.351 --> 00:45:44.351
<v Speaker 1>why did the Germans cut their losses?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have all this territory in the </v>

829
00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

830
00:45:45.111 --> 00:45:46.940
<v Speaker 1>in the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you make a deal,</v>

831
00:45:46.941 --> 00:45:48.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd go to the Russians and you go,</v>

832
00:45:48.771 --> 00:45:51.320
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all this territory of yours and we're</v>

833
00:45:51.321 --> 00:45:52.880
<v Speaker 1>going to stay here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you what,</v>

834
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:54.980
<v Speaker 1>you give us a good peace deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll pull back a little.</v>

835
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can negotiate from that,</v>

836
00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:02.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Nazis were hemmed in by their </v>

837
00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:03.860
<v Speaker 1>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't make a deal here.</v>

838
00:46:03.861 --> 00:46:05.930
<v Speaker 1>This isn't a battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

839
00:46:05.931 --> 00:46:08.810
<v Speaker 1>for the best deal we can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is in Hitler's mind,</v>

840
00:46:08.811 --> 00:46:13.130
<v Speaker 1>a life or death struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The plans that the Nazi leaders have for</v>

841
00:46:13.131 --> 00:46:18.131
<v Speaker 1>this area in the east requires them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>move millions of people eastward,</v>

842
00:46:18.681 --> 00:46:23.681
<v Speaker 1>maybe have a starvation plan to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>calling the numbers and then inserting </v>

843
00:46:23.681 --> 00:46:24.860
<v Speaker 1>German farmers into this whole.</v>

844
00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire thing.</v>

845
00:46:26.451 --> 00:46:31.451
<v Speaker 1>There is no plan b here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no place for compromise and </v>

846
00:46:32.661 --> 00:46:36.200
<v Speaker 1>what's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extreme brutality,</v>

847
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Nazi racial superiority and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology,</v>

848
00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pushed for a brutal campaign in the</v>

849
00:46:43.371 --> 00:46:48.371
<v Speaker 1>east pretty much made the people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other side in no mood to be cutting any </v>

850
00:46:48.951 --> 00:46:51.980
<v Speaker 1>deals with anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

851
00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:57.250
<v Speaker 1>didn't have to be that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The German military is always tough on </v>

852
00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:57.250
<v Speaker 1>people throughout history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

853
00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Remember Belgium in 1914,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they're,</v>

854
00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:04.420
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not a lightweight army when it </v>

855
00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:05.120
<v Speaker 1>comes to justice ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the crimes of the Nazis,</v>

856
00:47:05.121 --> 00:47:10.121
<v Speaker 1>because of the ideological question were</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much greater that there was nobody </v>

857
00:47:10.121 --> 00:47:14.921
<v Speaker 1>willing to compromise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my opinion,</v>

858
00:47:15.101 --> 00:47:20.101
<v Speaker 1>you take the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pry the infestation out of the </v>

859
00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:23.140
<v Speaker 1>German military and all the influence </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had had over the equipment,</v>

860
00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:24.550
<v Speaker 1>tactics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrine,</v>

861
00:47:24.551 --> 00:47:26.590
<v Speaker 1>strategy and approach of the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>military,</v>

862
00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:31.980
<v Speaker 1>and you instantly get stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put the World War leadership and </v>

863
00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:32.680
<v Speaker 1>ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

864
00:47:32.681 --> 00:47:37.681
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an aristocratic kind of an </v>

865
00:47:37.681 --> 00:47:39.190
<v Speaker 1>ideology in 19th century ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you put that in charge of the Second</v>

866
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:40.090
<v Speaker 1>World War German army and I bet it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

867
00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Let me end my attempt at making a case </v>
<v Speaker 1>here by once again,</v>

868
00:47:45.911 --> 00:47:50.911
<v Speaker 1>turning to General Heinz Kadarian who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was not afraid to go up to Hitler and </v>

869
00:47:52.481 --> 00:47:56.570
<v Speaker 1>ask the kinds of questions that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>get some people you know,</v>

870
00:47:56.620 --> 00:47:59.050
<v Speaker 1>hanging from the end of a meat hook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it pretty gutsy.</v>

871
00:47:59.051 --> 00:48:01.120
<v Speaker 1>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know if this really happened or</v>

872
00:48:01.121 --> 00:48:02.680
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a man's memoirs,</v>

873
00:48:02.681 --> 00:48:07.681
<v Speaker 1>but he says that after he watched Hitler</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically yell in the face of goring </v>

874
00:48:07.721 --> 00:48:09.840
<v Speaker 1>that he was a disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good area,</v>

875
00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:12.190
<v Speaker 1>and walks up to him and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why is he still here?</v>

876
00:48:12.191 --> 00:48:13.000
<v Speaker 1>He writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

877
00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:19.140
<v Speaker 1>as a result of this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning the dressing down of Hermann </v>

878
00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:22.291
<v Speaker 1>goring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I urged Hitler to act according to what </v>

879
00:48:22.291 --> 00:48:25.141
<v Speaker 1>he now realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to appoint some competent air force </v>

880
00:48:25.141 --> 00:48:25.990
<v Speaker 1>general just exceed the Reich's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marshall.</v>

881
00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:31.110
<v Speaker 1>I told him that we dare not risk losing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole war on account of the </v>

882
00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:33.730
<v Speaker 1>incompetence of one man like goring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Hitler replied,</v>

883
00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:39.100
<v Speaker 1>and this is Hitler talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's showing why the ideology </v>

884
00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:39.370
<v Speaker 1>trump's merit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler,</v>

885
00:48:39.371 --> 00:48:41.320
<v Speaker 1>according to God's Marion said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

886
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.320
<v Speaker 1>for political reasons I cannot do as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggest,</v>

887
00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:48.400
<v Speaker 1>the party would never understand my </v>
<v Speaker 1>motives and quote.</v>

888
00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:54.780
<v Speaker 1>So if you can't fire Hermann goring in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1944 near the end of the war for </v>

889
00:48:54.791 --> 00:48:59.791
<v Speaker 1>political reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that might explain why your </v>

890
00:48:59.791 --> 00:49:02.860
<v Speaker 1>military is less formidable than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war military right there.</v>

891
00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't even mention the goring isn't </v>

892
00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:08.650
<v Speaker 1>just in charge of the German air force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in charge of the German economy.</v>

893
00:49:08.651 --> 00:49:13.651
<v Speaker 1>When the four year plans going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could make an argument that at least</v>

894
00:49:13.691 --> 00:49:18.691
<v Speaker 1>goring has a background in fighter </v>
<v Speaker 1>aircraft and all that stuff because he </v>

895
00:49:18.691 --> 00:49:19.690
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why would you put that guy in charge</v>

896
00:49:19.691 --> 00:49:24.691
<v Speaker 1>of the German economy and who is good </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough even among the uber competent to </v>

897
00:49:24.791 --> 00:49:29.791
<v Speaker 1>be in charge of both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course we only chose Hermann </v>

898
00:49:29.791 --> 00:49:31.610
<v Speaker 1>goring because he's the most obvious </v>
<v Speaker 1>target,</v>

899
00:49:31.611 --> 00:49:36.611
<v Speaker 1>the tip of the iceberg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Nazis had people like this up and </v>

900
00:49:36.611 --> 00:49:39.110
<v Speaker 1>down as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leadership chain mixed with a lot of</v>

901
00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:41.840
<v Speaker 1>uber competent people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should point that out.</v>

902
00:49:41.841 --> 00:49:46.841
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise the Germans are not as </v>
<v Speaker 1>formidable as they were in the Second </v>

903
00:49:46.841 --> 00:49:47.210
<v Speaker 1>World War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of traditional German competency.</v>

904
00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.940
<v Speaker 1>That's why I compare these Nazis to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their war effort,</v>

905
00:49:49.941 --> 00:49:53.690
<v Speaker 1>like like some sort of parasite </v>
<v Speaker 1>infestation,</v>

906
00:49:53.691 --> 00:49:56.360
<v Speaker 1>sucking some of the blood of competency </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of them,</v>

907
00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:01.750
<v Speaker 1>leaving them still very competent but </v>
<v Speaker 1>weaker than they otherwise would be </v>

908
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:02.150
<v Speaker 1>compared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

909
00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:04.970
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their first world war version.</v>

910
00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Now in my account for brevity's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really my strong point,</v>

911
00:50:10.901 --> 00:50:12.730
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left out a lot of stuff.</v>

912
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:15.460
<v Speaker 1>We didn't even deal with things like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>navy,</v>

913
00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:16.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in comparison,</v>

914
00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:18.610
<v Speaker 1>first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>German navy,</v>

915
00:50:18.611 --> 00:50:21.520
<v Speaker 1>second most powerful navy in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second World War,</v>

916
00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:24.120
<v Speaker 1>German navy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere near that.</v>

917
00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:27.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no comparison there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the air force,</v>

918
00:50:27.741 --> 00:50:32.741
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's remember to get back to goring </v>

919
00:50:32.741 --> 00:50:34.541
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an air force that continually </v>

920
00:50:34.541 --> 00:50:37.181
<v Speaker 1>delayed the influx of new equipment in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of new designs,</v>

921
00:50:37.191 --> 00:50:39.350
<v Speaker 1>which as we pointed out earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is critical,</v>

922
00:50:39.351 --> 00:50:44.351
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The technology changes during the war </v>

923
00:50:44.351 --> 00:50:44.351
<v Speaker 1>itself because they're changing things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

924
00:50:44.351 --> 00:50:48.791
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we want this new jet to be a fighter </v>

925
00:50:48.791 --> 00:50:48.950
<v Speaker 1>or a bomber or a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean back and forth and every time</v>

926
00:50:48.951 --> 00:50:53.951
<v Speaker 1>they changed their mind as they lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>months and months of production time </v>

927
00:50:53.951 --> 00:50:55.180
<v Speaker 1>could have had jet aircraft years </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>

928
00:50:55.181 --> 00:51:00.181
<v Speaker 1>perhaps goring's the guy who told Hitler</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have his army stop and not annihilate</v>

929
00:51:01.041 --> 00:51:06.041
<v Speaker 1>the British who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were trapped did dunkirk in 1940 </v>

930
00:51:06.041 --> 00:51:06.980
<v Speaker 1>because the luftwaffe a wood finish them</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

931
00:51:06.981 --> 00:51:11.981
<v Speaker 1>They didn't goring's the guy that said </v>
<v Speaker 1>he could supply the encircled German </v>

932
00:51:11.981 --> 00:51:13.060
<v Speaker 1>troops of Stalin Grad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry,</v>

933
00:51:13.061 --> 00:51:14.500
<v Speaker 1>we'll do it by air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't.</v>

934
00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:19.450
<v Speaker 2>And you said you can't fire him in 1944.</v>

935
00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

936
00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:23.080
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

937
00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:28.620
<v Speaker 1>that is exhibit a right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the German first world war military</v>

938
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:33.190
<v Speaker 1>would have been in more formidable </v>
<v Speaker 1>opponent to face in its day.</v>

939
00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Then the Second World War German </v>
<v Speaker 1>military was in its day.</v>
