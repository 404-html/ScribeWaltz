<v Speaker 1>Today's show is sponsored by audible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to audible.com/Carlin.</v>

2
00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:09.651
<v Speaker 1>That's audible.com/Carlin</v>
<v Speaker 1>or text Carlin two five zero zero five </v>

3
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:11.730
<v Speaker 1>zero zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To get started,</v>

4
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.420
<v Speaker 1>I've just heard the audio that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>about to hear and this is my own </v>

5
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.460
<v Speaker 1>critique of the audio that you're about </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hear and it's a little redundant only</v>

6
00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:30.461
<v Speaker 1>because I actually started off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>program with a little bit of that sort </v>

7
00:00:30.461 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>of talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I apologize for the redundancy.</v>

8
00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to call this episode.</v>

9
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to throw a nightmare somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it sounds like a nightmare and I</v>

10
00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:43.130
<v Speaker 1>don't just mean because of the material </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is nightmarish.</v>

11
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Nothing new about that of course on what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do,</v>

12
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.420
<v Speaker 1>but almost my recounting of it is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

13
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Like you woke up in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>night screaming and the next morning and</v>

14
00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:56.540
<v Speaker 1>your spouse says to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the heck was that all about?</v>

15
00:00:56.541 --> 00:01:01.541
<v Speaker 1>And you try to recount what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in your nightmare.</v>

16
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.360
<v Speaker 1>And it always sounds like a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>disjointed flashing images.</v>

17
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.270
<v Speaker 1>we always like to try to put a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>artistic touch,</v>

19
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>your little flare here or there with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>big hardcore history shows and I feel </v>

20
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>like that's what's missing in the audio </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to hear now.</v>

21
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:21.881
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like I'm just telling you the </v>

22
00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:24.461
<v Speaker 1>highlights or worst moments or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that freaked me out the most or </v>

23
00:01:24.461 --> 00:01:26.570
<v Speaker 1>whatever is sticking in my memory after </v>
<v Speaker 1>going back to sleep in the middle of the</v>

24
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:29.330
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for some of you especially,</v>

25
00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:34.331
<v Speaker 1>I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those of you who already know some of </v>

26
00:01:34.331 --> 00:01:36.131
<v Speaker 1>this or all of this story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will remind you once again that you </v>

27
00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:40.731
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm recounting a nightmarish sort of </v>

28
00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:44.261
<v Speaker 1>story to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean think about how many people </v>

29
00:01:44.261 --> 00:01:44.261
<v Speaker 1>actually woke up in the night for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

30
00:01:44.261 --> 00:01:47.270
<v Speaker 1>many decades after this event with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>exact same nightmare.</v>

31
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:52.271
<v Speaker 1>And it's pretty safe to say that unlike </v>
<v Speaker 1>me who wasn't there,</v>

32
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.800
<v Speaker 1>the people who were there would probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>be unable to tell anyone else who wasn't</v>

33
00:01:57.801 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

34
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:04.151
<v Speaker 1>what they were seeing in their dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So apologies for the lack of artistic </v>

35
00:02:04.151 --> 00:02:09.080
<v Speaker 1>flair and what you're going to hear now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm in welcome to a nightmare of the</v>

36
00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Indianapolis.</v>

37
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.310
<v Speaker 1>It's hardcore history.</v>

38
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.450
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to think about what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between one of these hardcore</v>

39
00:02:22.451 --> 00:02:26.620
<v Speaker 1>history addendums and one of the larger </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardcore history shows is.</v>

40
00:02:26.621 --> 00:02:28.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference between the two of</v>

41
00:02:28.151 --> 00:02:31.330
<v Speaker 1>them besides obviously that we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>some interviews,</v>

42
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.250
<v Speaker 1>but I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:36.550
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole bunch of great stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there and I write them down.</v>

44
00:02:36.551 --> 00:02:41.551
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever I think of when I put it in a </v>

45
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:41.551
<v Speaker 1>book so that some day when I don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough ideas,</v>

46
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:45.961
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch already down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of you do this too and a </v>

47
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:49.921
<v Speaker 1>bunch of these ideas are not worth a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole history show or you can't do a </v>

48
00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:50.590
<v Speaker 1>whole history show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

49
00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:55.591
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to do something and have wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do something for a long time on the </v>

50
00:02:55.591 --> 00:02:59.880
<v Speaker 1>ancient Egyptian neighbor known as </v>
<v Speaker 1>coolish cushite,</v>

51
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>but there is no primary source material.</v>

52
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things where you just </v>

53
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.290
<v Speaker 1>can't hang a whole show on what you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work with.</v>

54
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of stories like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one today is like that.</v>

55
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean there is actually enough material</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do a whole big four hour thing on </v>

56
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>this subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would get repetitive and it would</v>

57
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:24.271
<v Speaker 1>get repetitive in a way that makes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war program we did with </v>

58
00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty repetitive in terms of,</v>

59
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ongoing horror.</v>

60
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 1>It would make that seem a little tame </v>
<v Speaker 1>because at a certain point in this story</v>

61
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:35.911
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing but that and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological torture after a certain </v>

62
00:03:36.381 --> 00:03:41.381
<v Speaker 1>amount of time and so it's hard to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>get gratuitous or it's hard to not just </v>

63
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:46.121
<v Speaker 1>get redundant at a certain point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be able to say to the </v>

64
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:46.130
<v Speaker 1>audience and there's just more of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know what that's like.</v>

65
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 1>I thought about talking about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I caught really the tail end the</v>

66
00:03:53.811 --> 00:03:55.940
<v Speaker 1>other night of a movie that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>underrated.</v>

67
00:03:55.941 --> 00:03:58.580
<v Speaker 1>Although when I went online to do some </v>
<v Speaker 1>more modern research on it,</v>

68
00:03:58.581 --> 00:04:03.581
<v Speaker 1>I was surprised to find that it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered kind of an artistic classic </v>

69
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:07.691
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of Steven Spielberg's really </v>

70
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:09.461
<v Speaker 1>early movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's jaws think it came out in 1975.</v>

71
00:04:09.861 --> 00:04:14.861
<v Speaker 1>I was 10 and I can tell you that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge event and sort of an unexpected </v>

72
00:04:16.521 --> 00:04:19.310
<v Speaker 1>when there'd been a novel that had done </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty well,</v>

73
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:24.490
<v Speaker 1>but the novel was very different than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie and the movie as all I think </v>

74
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.471
<v Speaker 1>really great films do has a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>really fine actors in it and you give </v>

75
00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:36.101
<v Speaker 1>those people a of really fine script and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess there was a significant amount </v>

76
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:40.721
<v Speaker 1>of improvisation from time to time that </v>
<v Speaker 1>made it into the final version that the </v>

77
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:40.721
<v Speaker 1>actors did.</v>

78
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.760
<v Speaker 1>But you remember who was in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate Roy Scheider who was great.</v>

79
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.140
<v Speaker 1>You had Richard Dreyfus who is still </v>
<v Speaker 1>great and my God,</v>

80
00:04:48.141 --> 00:04:51.420
<v Speaker 1>you had Robert Shaw who was unbelievable</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the.</v>

81
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.840
<v Speaker 1>In that role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean among others,</v>

82
00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.240
<v Speaker 1>and you get the three of them at certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>points in the story and they're just in </v>

83
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.240
<v Speaker 1>the cabin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

84
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.340
<v Speaker 1>there's no scenery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no movement,</v>

85
00:05:01.341 --> 00:05:06.341
<v Speaker 1>really have the cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just those three actors working to </v>

86
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:09.681
<v Speaker 1>find script and at one point Robert Shaw</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes into a monologue and it's </v>

87
00:05:09.681 --> 00:05:13.991
<v Speaker 1>incredible from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from an appreciating the craft </v>

88
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:17.150
<v Speaker 1>standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those of you who remember though,</v>

89
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.630
<v Speaker 1>the monologue it has to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>character that Robert Shaw,</v>

90
00:05:23.241 --> 00:05:27.320
<v Speaker 1>his playing and his past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's playing sort of an old sea dog kind</v>

91
00:05:27.321 --> 00:05:32.321
<v Speaker 1>of fishermen who is going to catch this </v>
<v Speaker 1>shark and he knows a lot about sharks </v>

92
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:35.450
<v Speaker 1>and he goes into the background and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns out he was on the USS Indianapolis</v>

93
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.150
<v Speaker 1>and those of you who know that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

94
00:05:38.151 --> 00:05:39.860
<v Speaker 1>how that's connected to sharks.</v>

95
00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.000
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm watching this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the tail end.</v>

96
00:05:44.001 --> 00:05:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josie and the night I just thought,</v>

97
00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:49.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Indianapolis is an amazing story and</v>

98
00:05:49.341 --> 00:05:53.360
<v Speaker 1>it typifies were sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of my interests tend to lean,</v>

99
00:05:53.361 --> 00:05:58.361
<v Speaker 1>as you all know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always like to say maybe it's a nice </v>

100
00:05:58.361 --> 00:05:59.270
<v Speaker 1>way of saying that I'm into the extremes</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the human experience,</v>

101
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 1>but some people think I'm just into war </v>
<v Speaker 1>and violence and you know,</v>

102
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:07.661
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I'll read accounts from like </v>

103
00:06:07.661 --> 00:06:11.440
<v Speaker 1>100 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a famous one from a German </v>

104
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.361
<v Speaker 1>general named von Moltke where he talks </v>
<v Speaker 1>about sort of the the reasons you </v>

105
00:06:13.361 --> 00:06:17.321
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't want to go too long between </v>
<v Speaker 1>wars because it brings out something in </v>

106
00:06:17.321 --> 00:06:19.880
<v Speaker 1>the human character and he's not talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the low level side.</v>

107
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:20.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

108
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 1>the killing of your fellow man and </v>
<v Speaker 1>butchery.</v>

109
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.790
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about sort of the higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>side of the human experience and it's </v>

110
00:06:30.591 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 1>weird to think about that.</v>

111
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.140
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with him about that.</v>

112
00:06:33.141 --> 00:06:38.141
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the story of the Indianapolis is a </v>

113
00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 1>perfect example of something where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>only happens because of war,</v>

114
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.630
<v Speaker 1>but what happens after the sinking of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ship,</v>

115
00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:47.420
<v Speaker 1>the famous sinking of the ship is one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these tales were.</v>

116
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean you just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sends tears down your face and not </v>

117
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.780
<v Speaker 1>just because of the human suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of the human reaction to the</v>

118
00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

119
00:06:55.731 --> 00:07:00.731
<v Speaker 1>That it was kind of those higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities that von Moltke was sort of </v>

120
00:07:00.731 --> 00:07:04.331
<v Speaker 1>referring to when you see people under </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing amounts of physical and </v>

121
00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:09.221
<v Speaker 1>psychological pressure with fellow human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings and how they act in situations </v>

122
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:14.501
<v Speaker 1>that are far more stressful than what </v>
<v Speaker 1>one could be expected to reasonably </v>

123
00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:15.440
<v Speaker 1>handle.</v>

124
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:15.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

125
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.770
<v Speaker 1>The Indianapolis combines a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things which would make my top 10 list </v>

126
00:07:22.081 --> 00:07:27.081
<v Speaker 1>of worst nightmares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrap them all into one wonderful </v>

127
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:27.081
<v Speaker 1>package.</v>

128
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.310
<v Speaker 1>If you are a fan of disaster movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to compare this to a disaster movie,</v>

129
00:07:32.311 --> 00:07:33.210
<v Speaker 1>no offense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

130
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.500
<v Speaker 1>family members of Indianapolis </v>
<v Speaker 1>survivors' or not survivors,</v>

131
00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.190
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>

132
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.550
<v Speaker 1>My mom was in a movie once that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>knock,</v>

133
00:07:41.551 --> 00:07:44.760
<v Speaker 1>a knock off of the towering inferno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So build a burning building.</v>

134
00:07:44.761 --> 00:07:49.761
<v Speaker 1>That's a disaster movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hang a whole movie on that and you </v>

135
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:49.761
<v Speaker 1>have something like the Poseidon </v>
<v Speaker 1>Adventure or titanic,</v>

136
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:51.560
<v Speaker 1>which is a disaster movie of a ship </v>
<v Speaker 1>sinking at sea.</v>

137
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Hang a whole movie on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

138
00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:00.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean each,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each segment and phase in the </v>

139
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.781
<v Speaker 1>Indianapolis story is one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>disaster films and by the time the </v>

140
00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:05.520
<v Speaker 1>stories over and is the story ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>really over,</v>

141
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:12.141
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like these people went from the </v>

143
00:08:12.141 --> 00:08:13.830
<v Speaker 1>towering inferno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopped on board the titanic.</v>

144
00:08:13.831 --> 00:08:18.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just one thing after another </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean to make light of it </v>

145
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:22.311
<v Speaker 1>because when you read the accounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what these people went through and then </v>

146
00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:27.171
<v Speaker 1>you sort of magnify it because what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>went through is not that uncommon in </v>

147
00:08:27.871 --> 00:08:30.180
<v Speaker 1>human history that they're not like </v>
<v Speaker 1>these real outliers.</v>

148
00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.040
<v Speaker 1>It's uncommon for you and me to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone through it.</v>

149
00:08:32.041 --> 00:08:37.041
<v Speaker 1>But how many mariners over the waves </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the era's have had their ship sink </v>

150
00:08:37.321 --> 00:08:38.760
<v Speaker 1>and gone through the terrible things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

151
00:08:38.761 --> 00:08:43.761
<v Speaker 1>that involves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then had to deal with some of the </v>

152
00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:46.441
<v Speaker 1>subsidiary things that all of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who went in the water with the </v>

153
00:08:46.441 --> 00:08:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Indianapolis had to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a funny way,</v>

154
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:53.540
<v Speaker 1>this is a kind of common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncommon human experience,</v>

155
00:08:53.971 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All but the Indianapolis,</v>

156
00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:01.230
<v Speaker 1>his story is they're just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got its own twists.</v>

157
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know it,</v>

158
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:08.361
<v Speaker 1>let me fill you in for a minute and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know how well this is going to </v>

159
00:09:08.361 --> 00:09:09.150
<v Speaker 1>work in short form because you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not my normal genre,</v>

160
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:15.320
<v Speaker 1>but the Indianapolis is famously known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a USS Portland class cruiser.</v>

161
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Heavy cruiser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heavy cruisers generally mean,</v>

162
00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>

163
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:20.960
<v Speaker 1>more armor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bigger gun.</v>

164
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.010
<v Speaker 1>So in the United States navy in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Second World War,</v>

165
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 1>if it had six inch guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was probably a light cruiser.</v>

166
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:27.690
<v Speaker 1>If it had eight inch guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was probably a heavy cruiser,</v>

167
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.430
<v Speaker 1>about 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>tons,</v>

168
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:33.240
<v Speaker 1>big ship home between 600 and 700 feet </v>
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

169
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.680
<v Speaker 1>And in this case the Indianapolis is </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous because it delivered some of the </v>

170
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.681
<v Speaker 1>key components to an island in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pacific that would be put together and </v>

171
00:09:42.681 --> 00:09:46.821
<v Speaker 1>made into the first atomic bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because of that it was a secret </v>

172
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:52.170
<v Speaker 1>mission and people weren't really in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>know about the comings and the goings of</v>

173
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:56.460
<v Speaker 1>the Indianapolis perhaps as well as they</v>
<v Speaker 1>should have been aware of it.</v>

174
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:02.390
<v Speaker 1>And this kind of plays into the story in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pretty big way because after </v>

175
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.830
<v Speaker 1>delivering the components to the island </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Tinian,</v>

176
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.640
<v Speaker 1>this Indianapolis Portland class heavy </v>
<v Speaker 1>cruiser goes off on its merry way kind </v>

177
00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:14.130
<v Speaker 1>of towards the Philippines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>

178
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:20.010
<v Speaker 1>And in the night gets torpedoed by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese submarine.</v>

179
00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Now this is in 1945,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's July.</v>

180
00:10:22.981 --> 00:10:24.180
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

181
00:10:24.181 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 1>we are not that far from the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war at all.</v>

182
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:27.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said,</v>

183
00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:30.210
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of putting the parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>together for the Hiroshima bomb.</v>

184
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.670
<v Speaker 1>So not that far away from the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

185
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:38.210
<v Speaker 1>But now you get to the first level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this disaster that these Indianapolis </v>

186
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.991
<v Speaker 1>folks have to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagined being asleep in your bunk at </v>

187
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:45.480
<v Speaker 1>night on a ship and to torpedo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slam into it.</v>

188
00:10:45.481 --> 00:10:47.400
<v Speaker 1>One slammed into the bow at the front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ship,</v>

189
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:48.840
<v Speaker 1>one slam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of mid ships,</v>

190
00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:50.970
<v Speaker 1>but a little forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

191
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.250
<v Speaker 1>survivors' accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

192
00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:58.251
<v Speaker 1>you want to read a good book on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me just break into this for a </v>

193
00:10:58.251 --> 00:11:00.980
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really loved in harm's way by Doug </v>

194
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Stanton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although there are several books on the </v>

195
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Indianapolis.</v>

196
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to quote a couple of pieces </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Stanton's book,</v>

197
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:08.130
<v Speaker 1>but if you think the story is </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting and you want to get the real</v>

198
00:11:08.131 --> 00:11:09.390
<v Speaker 1>feel for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does a great job,</v>

199
00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:12.060
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Stanton talks about,</v>

200
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the two torpedoes hit,</v>

201
00:11:13.651 --> 00:11:18.651
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's talking to a survivor that was </v>

202
00:11:18.651 --> 00:11:18.770
<v Speaker 1>loaded than the front of the ship and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was asleep in his bunk.</v>

203
00:11:18.771 --> 00:11:19.470
<v Speaker 1>And one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

204
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of ship rooms that they have that </v>

205
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:24.480
<v Speaker 1>you probably have six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

206
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.070
<v Speaker 1>10 guys in the bunks are stacked against</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wall.</v>

207
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:31.250
<v Speaker 1>And when the torpedoes hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the survivor says the lights go out and </v>

208
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.210
<v Speaker 1>all the bunks fall and everybody's in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pile of people and some have broken arms</v>

209
00:11:33.211 --> 00:11:38.211
<v Speaker 1>and ribs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody of course woken up from a </v>

210
00:11:38.211 --> 00:11:38.211
<v Speaker 1>deep sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're totally confused.</v>

211
00:11:38.211 --> 00:11:38.940
<v Speaker 1>And with the lights out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's extra bad.</v>

212
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:44.510
<v Speaker 1>So immediately this ship starts having </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems and so the crew starts doing </v>

213
00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:49.110
<v Speaker 1>the typical things you do to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent the ship from sinking.</v>

214
00:11:49.111 --> 00:11:54.111
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things you do is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start walling off the compartments that </v>

215
00:11:54.111 --> 00:11:54.111
<v Speaker 1>are damaged and flooding</v>

216
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:59.580
<v Speaker 1>dogging things down is the way a stanton</v>
<v Speaker 1>has the navy guys describing it in the </v>

217
00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.841
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is if you're </v>

218
00:12:03.841 --> 00:12:03.841
<v Speaker 1>cutting off compartments that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>flooding,</v>

219
00:12:03.841 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>still in the flooding compartments?</v>

220
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:11.011
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing that just horrifies </v>

221
00:12:11.011 --> 00:12:13.321
<v Speaker 1>you in this story of the Indianapolis </v>
<v Speaker 1>going down at night in the tropical </v>

222
00:12:13.321 --> 00:12:15.130
<v Speaker 1>waters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of east of the Philippines,</v>

223
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:20.490
<v Speaker 1>is that you have these sailors who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to cut their own ship mates off in </v>

224
00:12:22.961 --> 00:12:24.880
<v Speaker 1>flooding compartments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Stan says,</v>

225
00:12:24.881 --> 00:12:26.320
<v Speaker 1>you can hear him scream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

226
00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:27.610
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't leave us here.</v>

227
00:12:27.611 --> 00:12:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you.</v>

228
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:33.160
<v Speaker 1>But what are you supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right there you get in what to talk </v>

229
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.941
<v Speaker 1>human experiences that are extreme and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are already larger than most of us </v>

230
00:12:35.941 --> 00:12:37.900
<v Speaker 1>will ever face in the first five minutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this disaster.</v>

231
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.900
<v Speaker 1>There are guys dealing with things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to haunt their memories the </v>

232
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.270
<v Speaker 1>rest of their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the end,</v>

233
00:12:43.271 --> 00:12:46.480
<v Speaker 1>the affair is hardly started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

234
00:12:46.481 --> 00:12:51.481
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about the human capacity </v>
<v Speaker 1>for endurance survival and not just </v>

235
00:12:52.061 --> 00:12:55.120
<v Speaker 1>survival through the event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then to be able to live with it,</v>

236
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>

237
00:12:56.681 --> 00:13:01.681
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who was the captain of the </v>

238
00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Indianapolis made it about 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

239
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.820
<v Speaker 1>afterwards he'll survive the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

240
00:13:06.821 --> 00:13:11.821
<v Speaker 1>but he'll kill himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still Getting Christmas cards from </v>

241
00:13:11.821 --> 00:13:14.770
<v Speaker 1>people who say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm quoting one here,</v>

242
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:20.820
<v Speaker 1>merry Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our family's holiday would be a lot </v>

243
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:21.860
<v Speaker 1>merrier if you hadn't killed my son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stent.</v>

244
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.440
<v Speaker 1>And says that the captain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy named mcvay would keep all of </v>

245
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.290
<v Speaker 1>these letters and put them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

246
00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:31.630
<v Speaker 1>with a ribbon around them and keep them </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his desk,</v>

247
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:36.910
<v Speaker 1>blaming himself always for what happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that dark night.</v>

248
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:41.910
<v Speaker 1>But on this ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that survive will talk </v>

249
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:42.970
<v Speaker 1>about seeing him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

250
00:13:42.971 --> 00:13:46.450
<v Speaker 1>running around this sinking ship as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to take on water.</v>

251
00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:51.451
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have 12 minutes between the time </v>

252
00:13:51.451 --> 00:13:52.330
<v Speaker 1>the torpedo strike until the time it </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes down.</v>

253
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:58.630
<v Speaker 1>And once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of having a between 600 and 700</v>

254
00:13:58.631 --> 00:14:00.310
<v Speaker 1>foot long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

255
00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:05.311
<v Speaker 1>ton ship begin to disintegrate out from </v>
<v Speaker 1>under you and go under water as the </v>

256
00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:09.970
<v Speaker 1>waves begin rolling people off the deck </v>
<v Speaker 1>is crazy also.</v>

257
00:14:09.971 --> 00:14:13.810
<v Speaker 1>So now right away we're like the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

258
00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:18.811
<v Speaker 1>So you had to cut your semen off and dog</v>
<v Speaker 1>down into compartments and consign them </v>

259
00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:21.490
<v Speaker 1>to certain depths of the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ship might survive.</v>

260
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:26.850
<v Speaker 1>Now you're dealing with the mental image</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this ship starting to go down by the </v>

261
00:14:27.521 --> 00:14:31.540
<v Speaker 1>bow that's in the front and the stern </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to slowly rise out of the.</v>

262
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:36.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean the ship is going perpendicular </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are dropping off and stanton </v>

263
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:38.860
<v Speaker 1>describe survivors saying people will </v>
<v Speaker 1>jump off and hit the rudders.</v>

264
00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:43.861
<v Speaker 1>People will jump off and hit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>propellors that are still spinning and </v>

265
00:14:43.861 --> 00:14:46.420
<v Speaker 1>be launched off into space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

266
00:14:46.421 --> 00:14:51.421
<v Speaker 1>how do you even in 12 minutes or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>really pro process all this and it's </v>

267
00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:57.191
<v Speaker 1>dark and people are freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is like a giant accident </v>

268
00:14:57.191 --> 00:15:00.770
<v Speaker 1>scene right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like between 11 and 1200 guys on</v>

269
00:15:00.771 --> 00:15:05.771
<v Speaker 1>the ship and more than 300 are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>die in the first 12 minutes,</v>

270
00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.760
<v Speaker 1>and so you're watching all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and many of these people now </v>

271
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:11.760
<v Speaker 1>are grievously wounded.</v>

272
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Stanton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the main survivors he talks </v>

273
00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.711
<v Speaker 1>about in this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the first thing he hears when he </v>

274
00:15:20.711 --> 00:15:22.460
<v Speaker 1>recovers from hearing the torpedo hits </v>
<v Speaker 1>is somebody screaming in the compartment</v>

275
00:15:22.461 --> 00:15:25.190
<v Speaker 1>next door and he runs over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>realizes it's his friend,</v>

276
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:30.191
<v Speaker 1>the dentist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he can't open the door because the </v>

277
00:15:30.191 --> 00:15:32.201
<v Speaker 1>whole thing's on fire and he just has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>let him burn to death in the first two </v>

278
00:15:32.201 --> 00:15:35.441
<v Speaker 1>minutes and then he burns his hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the ship itself is turning red </v>

279
00:15:35.441 --> 00:15:39.911
<v Speaker 1>hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He puts his hands on the deck or on a </v>

280
00:15:39.911 --> 00:15:39.911
<v Speaker 1>rail boom and he's got burned hands</v>

281
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.760
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the ship starts to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of perpendicular.</v>

282
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.020
<v Speaker 1>He tells the story about they have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of wounded people,</v>

283
00:15:48.021 --> 00:15:53.021
<v Speaker 1>I guess in the Sick Bay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're on cots and they're tied to </v>

284
00:15:53.021 --> 00:15:56.381
<v Speaker 1>their beds and whatnot and he says they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just all slide right into the sea and </v>

285
00:15:56.381 --> 00:15:58.700
<v Speaker 1>he's sitting there watching this happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slack,</v>

286
00:15:58.701 --> 00:16:03.701
<v Speaker 1>jawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read a book a while back and it's </v>

287
00:16:03.701 --> 00:16:08.561
<v Speaker 1>about how people react in disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to remember what it was like if </v>

288
00:16:09.261 --> 00:16:10.760
<v Speaker 1>the worst should occur or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

289
00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I think we talked about at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

290
00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:18.070
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's by one of these experts who </v>

291
00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:19.811
<v Speaker 1>studies these things and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they said is in situations </v>

292
00:16:19.811 --> 00:16:19.811
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

293
00:16:19.811 --> 00:16:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Plane crashes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shipwrecks or whatnot.</v>

294
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Most people are like stunned into </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbness.</v>

295
00:16:25.371 --> 00:16:29.690
<v Speaker 1>They don't do anything right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some of these bad plane crashes,</v>

296
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.020
<v Speaker 1>everybody could have gotten out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they sat there and burned to death,</v>

297
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the tarmac.</v>

298
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:39.910
<v Speaker 1>That's shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what you would expect to </v>

299
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:43.271
<v Speaker 1>happen on a ship like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet maybe it's the military </v>

300
00:16:43.271 --> 00:16:43.271
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

301
00:16:43.271 --> 00:16:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the thank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have officers barking out orders,</v>

302
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:50.740
<v Speaker 1>but you're not seeing a ton of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are seeing people jumping in the </v>

303
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:51.830
<v Speaker 1>water as fast as they can go because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all afraid of the same thing.</v>

304
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.100
<v Speaker 1>When a big ship goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sucks stuffed down with it.</v>

305
00:16:55.101 --> 00:17:00.101
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the time it creates a vacuum </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that can drowned swimmers who are </v>

306
00:17:00.101 --> 00:17:02.330
<v Speaker 1>anywhere nearby so everyone knows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ship's going down.</v>

307
00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:03.980
<v Speaker 1>You've got to get as far away from it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

308
00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:08.981
<v Speaker 1>It's like you know when you get into an </v>
<v Speaker 1>auto wreck and you're worried that the </v>

309
00:17:08.981 --> 00:17:09.140
<v Speaker 1>gasoline is leaking in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the car is going to catch on fire.</v>

310
00:17:09.141 --> 00:17:10.520
<v Speaker 1>You want to get far away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

311
00:17:10.521 --> 00:17:15.521
<v Speaker 1>when the ship goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to suck everything down with </v>

312
00:17:15.521 --> 00:17:15.521
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

313
00:17:15.521 --> 00:17:15.521
<v Speaker 1>In several of the survivors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>

314
00:17:15.521 --> 00:17:20.111
<v Speaker 1>imagine this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them talks about having it feel </v>

315
00:17:20.111 --> 00:17:23.480
<v Speaker 1>as though somebody was yanking his foot </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his shoe came off and all of a sudden</v>

316
00:17:23.481 --> 00:17:28.481
<v Speaker 1>with a life vest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went way under water to where his </v>

317
00:17:28.481 --> 00:17:32.171
<v Speaker 1>ears are popping in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His eyes feel like they're going to pop </v>

318
00:17:32.171 --> 00:17:35.321
<v Speaker 1>out of his head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he said he got caught in a </v>

319
00:17:35.321 --> 00:17:36.980
<v Speaker 1>giant air bubble that escaped from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sinking ship and it goes,</v>

320
00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:42.160
<v Speaker 1>pops up and shoots him up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said three feet into the air before </v>

321
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.901
<v Speaker 1>we came down again in an absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>pitch black ocean covered as far as the </v>

322
00:17:48.261 --> 00:17:52.680
<v Speaker 1>eye could see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could see in the dark with a two inch</v>

323
00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:58.370
<v Speaker 1>thick molasses like consistency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil spill from the ship that is burning </v>

324
00:18:00.331 --> 00:18:05.331
<v Speaker 1>the eyes and coding all of these men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you ever look at photographs of </v>

325
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:10.610
<v Speaker 1>people being rescued from like their </v>
<v Speaker 1>shipping torpedoed when maybe they were </v>

326
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:12.090
<v Speaker 1>in the merchant marine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they were on a destroyer,</v>

327
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.240
<v Speaker 1>but you can kind of see there's some </v>
<v Speaker 1>great a life magazine ones I recall.</v>

328
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:20.390
<v Speaker 1>And when they come on board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're covered in oil and that's what </v>

329
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:23.001
<v Speaker 1>these people are instantly covered in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's worse is that oil can catch </v>

330
00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:25.200
<v Speaker 1>on fire and the surface of the ocean can</v>
<v Speaker 1>burn.</v>

331
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:26.820
<v Speaker 1>That happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at,</v>

332
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie footage,</v>

333
00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:33.141
<v Speaker 1>you can see that happen to Pearl Harbor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the ocean caught on fire in </v>

334
00:18:33.141 --> 00:18:36.441
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so at this point what you have is the </v>

335
00:18:36.441 --> 00:18:40.911
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of like the titanic sinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the Lusitania is torpedoing big </v>

336
00:18:42.781 --> 00:18:45.720
<v Speaker 1>ship going down in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean.</v>

337
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between both the titanic and </v>

338
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:51.050
<v Speaker 1>the Lusitania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

339
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:55.220
<v Speaker 1>if I can boil it down to one thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the temperature.</v>

340
00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.980
<v Speaker 1>When the titanic sank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had an iceberg,</v>

341
00:18:58.981 --> 00:19:03.981
<v Speaker 1>so it's cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Lusitania went down sort of over by </v>

342
00:19:03.981 --> 00:19:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe I'm cold water.</v>

343
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.530
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to have people </v>
<v Speaker 1>surviving a long time in the water.</v>

344
00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to rescue them </v>

345
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.950
<v Speaker 1>actively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a nightmarish situation,</v>

346
00:19:16.951 --> 00:19:17.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

347
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.850
<v Speaker 1>You've got to get to the people before </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get hypothermia and they die in the</v>

348
00:19:20.851 --> 00:19:23.280
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

349
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:27.510
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to die anyway in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>

350
00:19:27.511 --> 00:19:30.720
<v Speaker 1>in the Pacific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the very tropical warm regions,</v>

351
00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:35.721
<v Speaker 1>you might wish it had come as quickly as</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold water because when the water is </v>

352
00:19:35.721 --> 00:19:39.000
<v Speaker 1>warm as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes slightly over 80 degrees,</v>

353
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:44.390
<v Speaker 1>you can stay on the water a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good thing if you're trying to be </v>

354
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:45.480
<v Speaker 1>rescued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad things.</v>

355
00:19:45.481 --> 00:19:50.481
<v Speaker 1>If there's other things in the water you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know besides you that you need to worry </v>

356
00:19:50.521 --> 00:19:55.521
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also bad if you don't have any fresh </v>

357
00:19:55.521 --> 00:19:55.521
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they don't,</v>

358
00:19:55.521 --> 00:20:00.350
<v Speaker 1>and all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 300 or so men perished right </v>

359
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:04.881
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nine hundred or so men are in the water </v>

360
00:20:04.881 --> 00:20:04.920
<v Speaker 1>and you begin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

361
00:20:04.921 --> 00:20:07.470
<v Speaker 1>the other part of the nightmarish thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

362
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the ocean at night in the water,</v>

363
00:20:12.031 --> 00:20:13.140
<v Speaker 1>in the ocean at night.</v>

364
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.020
<v Speaker 1>There's something calm and beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

365
00:20:16.021 --> 00:20:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's something,</v>

366
00:20:18.061 --> 00:20:19.890
<v Speaker 1>a little freaky about it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

367
00:20:19.891 --> 00:20:24.891
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath you if you're in the deep </v>

368
00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:25.080
<v Speaker 1>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

369
00:20:25.081 --> 00:20:27.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a whole world of ocean </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath you.</v>

370
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:34.010
<v Speaker 1>What's more is if there is no moon out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can get pitch black and you can't see</v>

371
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:40.160
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now when we talk about personal </v>

372
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.421
<v Speaker 1>things that would bother us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting into my own personal </v>

373
00:20:44.421 --> 00:20:47.211
<v Speaker 1>nightmares a little bit here because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw me out in the middle of the ocean </v>

374
00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:51.140
<v Speaker 1>in pitch black darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>

375
00:20:51.141 --> 00:20:53.840
<v Speaker 1>So I'm already going to have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological problems,</v>

376
00:20:53.841 --> 00:20:58.841
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do think that this is why these </v>

377
00:20:58.841 --> 00:21:01.991
<v Speaker 1>stories fascinate me because these </v>
<v Speaker 1>figures in the story because of things </v>

378
00:21:01.991 --> 00:21:06.320
<v Speaker 1>like war are cast into situations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are well unimaginable.</v>

379
00:21:06.321 --> 00:21:11.321
<v Speaker 1>And if they just gave up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would totally understand the fact </v>

380
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:11.640
<v Speaker 1>that they don't is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

381
00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.830
<v Speaker 1>the old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a cliche,</v>

382
00:21:12.831 --> 00:21:14.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's the triumph of the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>

383
00:21:14.451 --> 00:21:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

384
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:22.100
<v Speaker 1>And let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people do give up in this </v>

385
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:22.100
<v Speaker 1>story and you can totally sympathize </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them too,</v>

386
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:27.050
<v Speaker 1>when you hear what they've gone through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the story continues and you begin to </v>

387
00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:27.050
<v Speaker 1>find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

388
00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:27.860
<v Speaker 1>the men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

389
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:31.260
<v Speaker 1>as the light of day breaks out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>

390
00:21:31.261 --> 00:21:34.080
<v Speaker 1>they're all in clusters spread out over </v>
<v Speaker 1>a great distance,</v>

391
00:21:34.081 --> 00:21:35.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calling to each other,</v>

392
00:21:35.101 --> 00:21:40.101
<v Speaker 1>trying to find each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to sort of swim to each other as </v>

393
00:21:40.101 --> 00:21:40.170
<v Speaker 1>best they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The horrible part of the story now,</v>

394
00:21:40.171 --> 00:21:45.171
<v Speaker 1>when they're in the water though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a lot of people have horrible </v>

395
00:21:45.171 --> 00:21:45.180
<v Speaker 1>injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't have a bunch of healthy,</v>

396
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ready to go.</v>

397
00:21:46.441 --> 00:21:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Lifeguard type people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump in the water,</v>

398
00:21:48.301 --> 00:21:50.850
<v Speaker 1>you had a bunch of shipwreck survivors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

399
00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:52.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one guy in the story,</v>

400
00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and once again,</v>

401
00:21:54.181 --> 00:21:59.181
<v Speaker 1>I always try to remember that the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were with these people who survived </v>

402
00:21:59.181 --> 00:22:00.180
<v Speaker 1>carried these memories with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

403
00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:05.360
<v Speaker 1>But one guy in this story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a friend of one of the people he </v>

404
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.171
<v Speaker 1>keeps quoting in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanton has his eyes completely burned </v>

405
00:22:09.171 --> 00:22:11.100
<v Speaker 1>out and he's going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to take him time,</v>

406
00:22:11.101 --> 00:22:16.101
<v Speaker 1>but nobody wants to leave him again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see these higher qualities come to </v>

407
00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:16.101
<v Speaker 1>the fore where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

408
00:22:16.101 --> 00:22:20.751
<v Speaker 1>nobody might survive this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to take a guy who's </v>

409
00:22:20.751 --> 00:22:20.751
<v Speaker 1>certainly not going to survive it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>expand,</v>

410
00:22:20.751 --> 00:22:25.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>important energy that could be spent on </v>

411
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:25.720
<v Speaker 1>living people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

412
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:25.720
<v Speaker 1>could go either way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

413
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.810
<v Speaker 1>that's the higher human qualities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

414
00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:30.180
<v Speaker 1>And so he talks about this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually saying,</v>

415
00:22:30.181 --> 00:22:32.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

416
00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:33.690
<v Speaker 1>here's what I want you to tell my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

417
00:22:33.691 --> 00:22:35.640
<v Speaker 1>and all these kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's wrenching.</v>

418
00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't help but think that if the </v>

419
00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:43.590
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a doctor who's hearing this</v>

420
00:22:43.591 --> 00:22:45.120
<v Speaker 1>man with the burnout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell him,</v>

421
00:22:45.121 --> 00:22:46.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what I want you to tell my wife.</v>

422
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:51.500
<v Speaker 1>If he's in no danger at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to take that memory to the </v>

423
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.050
<v Speaker 1>grave with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

424
00:22:52.051 --> 00:22:57.051
<v Speaker 1>Probably going to drink a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 1>whiskey than he otherwise would have </v>

425
00:22:57.051 --> 00:22:59.160
<v Speaker 1>drank in his life because that is such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally impacting moment,</v>

426
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.520
<v Speaker 1>but he himself is about to go through </v>
<v Speaker 1>this harrowing experience and it's going</v>

427
00:23:03.521 --> 00:23:07.650
<v Speaker 1>to be one hammer blow to the psyche of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people after another.</v>

428
00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.320
<v Speaker 1>You have a lot of wounded people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>

429
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.420
<v Speaker 1>bleeding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of burns,</v>

430
00:23:12.421 --> 00:23:17.421
<v Speaker 1>and as you all know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burns are particularly nasty and </v>

431
00:23:17.421 --> 00:23:20.331
<v Speaker 1>horrible and not enough life jackets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people floating on flotsam and Jetsam.</v>

432
00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.680
<v Speaker 1>The Guy I just mentioned who had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

433
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:32.030
<v Speaker 1>you know what the dying sailor wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife told was named Dr Haynes and </v>

434
00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:36.401
<v Speaker 1>he's quoted by Stanton in the book and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this incident is particularly </v>

435
00:23:36.401 --> 00:23:36.530
<v Speaker 1>highlighted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

436
00:23:36.531 --> 00:23:41.531
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are vomiting because they've </v>

437
00:23:41.531 --> 00:23:42.620
<v Speaker 1>ingested salt water and fuel oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanton writes,</v>

438
00:23:42.621 --> 00:23:47.621
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few boys were vomiting violently that </v>

439
00:23:47.621 --> 00:23:47.621
<v Speaker 1>they</v>

440
00:23:47.621 --> 00:23:49.610
<v Speaker 3>were actually doing somersaults in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>water trying to keep calm.</v>

441
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.190
<v Speaker 3>Haynes called out here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right here,</v>

442
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.730
<v Speaker 3>where's the six sailor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he moved into the throng,</v>

443
00:23:55.910 --> 00:24:00.910
<v Speaker 3>about a dozen sailors were holding a </v>
<v Speaker 3>body aloft and amazing feat of strength </v>

444
00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:05.261
<v Speaker 3>considering that they were all treading </v>
<v Speaker 3>water furiously to stay afloat beneath </v>

445
00:24:05.261 --> 00:24:09.221
<v Speaker 3>the added weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the man in question was in terrible </v>

446
00:24:09.221 --> 00:24:09.221
<v Speaker 3>shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stanton writes,</v>

447
00:24:09.221 --> 00:24:12.680
<v Speaker 3>his eyes had been burned away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The flesh on his hands was gone,</v>

448
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.880
<v Speaker 3>and what remained were bare tendons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The boy held him up in an effort to keep</v>

449
00:24:16.881 --> 00:24:20.270
<v Speaker 3>these wounds out of the stinging bath of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saltwater Haynes.</v>

450
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.880
<v Speaker 3>Recognize the man as his good friend in </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberty,</v>

451
00:24:22.881 --> 00:24:27.881
<v Speaker 3>buddy gunnery officer Stanley Lipski.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Miraculously Lipski had made his way </v>

452
00:24:27.951 --> 00:24:31.790
<v Speaker 3>blind from the quarter deck off the ship</v>
<v Speaker 3>and into the water.</v>

453
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.730
<v Speaker 3>Haynes knew that Lipsky's pain must be </v>
<v Speaker 3>intolerable.</v>

454
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.660
<v Speaker 3>He himself could barely look at his old </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend who was moaning softly.</v>

455
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:44.020
<v Speaker 3>Stanley he knew was one tough bird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hanes also understood that he didn't </v>

456
00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:46.220
<v Speaker 3>have long to live reluctantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He turned away</v>

457
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.490
<v Speaker 1>to those who could actually help end </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

458
00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:56.760
<v Speaker 1>and yet that guy with the burned out </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes will make it onto a life raft and </v>

459
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.610
<v Speaker 1>eventually tell that same doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

460
00:24:57.611 --> 00:25:01.840
<v Speaker 1>what he wants his wife to no last words </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

461
00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.910
<v Speaker 1>get married again after me and all that.</v>

462
00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Now I should point out that at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in the story,</v>

463
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:14.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be a war story from many </v>

464
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:15.100
<v Speaker 1>theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many different kinds of conflicts,</v>

465
00:25:15.101 --> 00:25:20.101
<v Speaker 1>over many different arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The part though that is about to happen </v>

466
00:25:20.101 --> 00:25:24.361
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the part that inspired me to talk about </v>

467
00:25:24.361 --> 00:25:24.361
<v Speaker 1>this perhaps tapping into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

468
00:25:24.361 --> 00:25:28.171
<v Speaker 1>your own secret nightmares is a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit different and no doubt it happened </v>

469
00:25:29.231 --> 00:25:34.231
<v Speaker 1>many times in history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not recorded on anyone's parchment or </v>

470
00:25:34.231 --> 00:25:38.800
<v Speaker 1>know logs anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this happened in close enough to </v>

471
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.200
<v Speaker 1>modern times that we have many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

472
00:25:41.201 --> 00:25:46.201
<v Speaker 1>many gruesome memories written down by </v>
<v Speaker 1>survivors of what it was like to go down</v>

473
00:25:47.171 --> 00:25:50.470
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the ocean with sharks </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

474
00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.330
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen the drone footage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it came out recently.</v>

475
00:25:55.331 --> 00:26:00.331
<v Speaker 1>Lee was showing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the Florida coast from a </v>

476
00:26:00.331 --> 00:26:01.420
<v Speaker 1>drone above,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say 500 feet,</v>

477
00:26:01.421 --> 00:26:03.310
<v Speaker 1>a thousand feet above just the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coastline,</v>

478
00:26:03.311 --> 00:26:08.311
<v Speaker 1>so it's basically taking pictures 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>yards off shore and it appears to be </v>

479
00:26:08.561 --> 00:26:09.940
<v Speaker 1>schools of fish.</v>

480
00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.550
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying close attention.</v>

481
00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.080
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of fish.</v>

482
00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.850
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

483
00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:19.270
<v Speaker 1>fish in the general term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's officially still fish,</v>

484
00:26:19.271 --> 00:26:22.810
<v Speaker 1>but they're sharks and I guess they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we're migrating,</v>

485
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:28.020
<v Speaker 1>but the first thing you notice if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to you watch it over </v>

486
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.721
<v Speaker 1>and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that I'm obsessed with it or </v>

487
00:26:30.721 --> 00:26:32.491
<v Speaker 1>anything like that is that most of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>sharks I was reading in the photograph </v>

488
00:26:32.491 --> 00:26:36.070
<v Speaker 1>or in the drone footage are in the four </v>
<v Speaker 1>to six feet range,</v>

489
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:41.100
<v Speaker 1>kind of a fully grown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a decent size shark from one of these </v>

490
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 1>particular breeds of shark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can instantly tell those average</v>

491
00:26:44.341 --> 00:26:45.570
<v Speaker 1>size ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

492
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.290
<v Speaker 1>every now and then there are big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

493
00:26:47.291 --> 00:26:52.291
<v Speaker 1>big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you don't even know what they </v>

494
00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:52.291
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eighteen feet maybe.</v>

495
00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:52.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at them and there you go.</v>

496
00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:52.980
<v Speaker 1>That's three times as long as the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

497
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Imagine being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

498
00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:02.100
<v Speaker 1>just your paragliding one day off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida coast and you just splashed down</v>

499
00:27:02.101 --> 00:27:07.101
<v Speaker 1>right in the middle of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's no guarantee that anything </v>

500
00:27:07.101 --> 00:27:07.680
<v Speaker 1>will happen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

501
00:27:07.681 --> 00:27:09.330
<v Speaker 1>They may just all scatter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>frightened.</v>

502
00:27:09.331 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Leave you totally alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they might not.</v>

503
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you're bleeding at the same time</v>

504
00:27:16.321 --> 00:27:18.240
<v Speaker 1>that's going to make any difference or </v>
<v Speaker 1>wounded.</v>

505
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.440
<v Speaker 1>What if you're there for a long time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't go away?</v>

506
00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:23.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing to say I crashed,</v>

507
00:27:23.821 --> 00:27:27.210
<v Speaker 1>landed off the coast of Florida into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>school of sharks and I swam to the shore</v>

508
00:27:27.211 --> 00:27:29.010
<v Speaker 1>and I made it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morocco stay alive.</v>

509
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:34.310
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what have you stayed there for four </v>

510
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.310
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

511
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.310
<v Speaker 2>Hm?</v>

512
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Is that a nightmare?</v>

513
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the daytime.</v>

514
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:43.770
<v Speaker 1>What happens when you turn out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lights on that and what happens when the</v>

515
00:27:43.771 --> 00:27:46.380
<v Speaker 1>sharks start attacking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not You,</v>

516
00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.220
<v Speaker 1>but people within hearing distance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

517
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:56.030
<v Speaker 1>The nightmare of the Indianapolis and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the key part of the monologue that </v>

518
00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:59.751
<v Speaker 1>Robert Shaw gives us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quint character in jaws is what the </v>

519
00:27:59.751 --> 00:28:03.960
<v Speaker 1>moment when the sharks started attacking</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hundreds of men in the water is like</v>

520
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.230
<v Speaker 1>they can see them underneath them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

521
00:28:07.231 --> 00:28:12.231
<v Speaker 1>this is what's so freaky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that this water is apparently clear </v>

522
00:28:12.231 --> 00:28:12.231
<v Speaker 1>to like 40 or 50 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

523
00:28:12.231 --> 00:28:13.770
<v Speaker 1>you're in the tropics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a gorgeous color.</v>

524
00:28:13.771 --> 00:28:18.771
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so bright when the sun starts </v>

525
00:28:18.771 --> 00:28:20.721
<v Speaker 1>hitting the water that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's blinding people and it's over </v>

526
00:28:20.721 --> 00:28:24.710
<v Speaker 1>100 degrees in the daytime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're frying the parts that are </v>

527
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.100
<v Speaker 1>above the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If these people have life vests,</v>

528
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:31.430
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of the people who are floating </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the water with life vests will lose </v>

529
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:32.490
<v Speaker 1>everything underneath the water to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharks.</v>

530
00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:35.330
<v Speaker 1>And there are multiple accounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people you know,</v>

531
00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:38.510
<v Speaker 1>tapping a buddy who appears to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping in his life,</v>

532
00:28:38.511 --> 00:28:41.640
<v Speaker 1>vest on the water's surface and having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:28:41.641 --> 00:28:46.641
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Quintin jaws actually talks about </v>

534
00:28:46.641 --> 00:28:46.641
<v Speaker 1>this too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And having them turn over like,</v>

535
00:28:46.641 --> 00:28:46.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

536
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:48.030
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bob,</v>

537
00:28:48.031 --> 00:28:50.550
<v Speaker 1>if you will turn over and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing below the waist,</v>

538
00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:57.450
<v Speaker 1>you can see the sharks below you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of these sailors that a stanton </v>

539
00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:03.010
<v Speaker 1>talks about say that they would see some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the same sharks and recognize them so</v>

540
00:29:03.011 --> 00:29:08.011
<v Speaker 1>often that they gave them names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once Taylor gave a tiger shark of huge </v>

541
00:29:08.011 --> 00:29:08.680
<v Speaker 1>tiger shark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name Oscar,</v>

542
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:11.560
<v Speaker 1>and eventually another stapler took a </v>
<v Speaker 1>two inch pen knife,</v>

543
00:29:11.561 --> 00:29:12.250
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

544
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:15.280
<v Speaker 1>nothing and tried to stab at one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

545
00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Some of these sailors were on a raft </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it was a,</v>

546
00:29:18.341 --> 00:29:22.450
<v Speaker 1>the raft was disintegrating over time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it had a sort of a lattice floor,</v>

547
00:29:22.451 --> 00:29:27.451
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a little hole developing </v>

548
00:29:27.451 --> 00:29:30.691
<v Speaker 1>in the floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these big sharks would come up and </v>

549
00:29:30.691 --> 00:29:30.691
<v Speaker 1>stick their snouts right through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

550
00:29:30.691 --> 00:29:31.330
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw this in jars with jaws,</v>

551
00:29:31.331 --> 00:29:36.331
<v Speaker 1>with the mechanical structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stick their nose right through and try </v>

552
00:29:36.331 --> 00:29:38.821
<v Speaker 1>to get ahold of something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sailors started kicking it in the </v>

553
00:29:38.821 --> 00:29:42.070
<v Speaker 1>face to me being in</v>

554
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.950
<v Speaker 2>the ocean in the middle of the night,</v>

555
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:47.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no land anywhere,</v>

556
00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.800
<v Speaker 1>no ships anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no birds,</v>

557
00:29:49.801 --> 00:29:53.160
<v Speaker 1>no planes and sharks all around hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

558
00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:58.490
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the most terrifying situation I </v>

559
00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:01.611
<v Speaker 1>can think about and what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I was going to do once as I was </v>

560
00:30:01.611 --> 00:30:04.371
<v Speaker 1>going to do either a book or maybe a TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>series where the entire premise was </v>

561
00:30:04.371 --> 00:30:08.991
<v Speaker 1>based around the worst place you can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world on any given moment in </v>

562
00:30:08.991 --> 00:30:13.251
<v Speaker 1>history dot January 27th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1987 and Tunisia the worst place to be </v>

563
00:30:13.251 --> 00:30:13.251
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

564
00:30:13.251 --> 00:30:14.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the battle of cannae in Italy,</v>

565
00:30:14.761 --> 00:30:15.570
<v Speaker 1>worst place to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to work.</v>

566
00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.630
<v Speaker 1>This is the worst place to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

567
00:30:18.631 --> 00:30:21.750
<v Speaker 1>To me on that date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe any date,</v>

568
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.290
<v Speaker 1>it takes a lot of the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most nasty things I can think of.</v>

569
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Packages them together in one horrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of event,</v>

570
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:35.810
<v Speaker 1>and then put these people in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological challenge where day after </v>

571
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:40.500
<v Speaker 1>day they're in the water because nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows they're gone this mission.</v>

572
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:44.160
<v Speaker 1>So secret delivering the components for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bomb meant that they were,</v>

573
00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:47.370
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like they were totally off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>radar when you read the reports,</v>

574
00:30:47.371 --> 00:30:50.760
<v Speaker 1>it was quite a scandal after the war </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Indianapolis going down will</v>

575
00:30:50.761 --> 00:30:53.130
<v Speaker 1>be the worst disaster in US Navy </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

576
00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.120
<v Speaker 1>But there were several sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just call them variables maybe.</v>

577
00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:57.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

578
00:30:57.871 --> 00:30:58.680
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>

579
00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Variable number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these ships should have been noticed</v>

580
00:31:01.681 --> 00:31:06.681
<v Speaker 1>when they were missing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were the number of little things </v>

581
00:31:06.681 --> 00:31:06.681
<v Speaker 1>that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see this,</v>

582
00:31:06.681 --> 00:31:06.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Pearl Harbor attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another one where,</v>

583
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.760
<v Speaker 1>a little variable here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that doesn't happen,</v>

584
00:31:08.761 --> 00:31:09.970
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

585
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:14.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to call it okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can kind of see how it happened.</v>

586
00:31:14.851 --> 00:31:18.000
<v Speaker 1>And yet what it meant was instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being rescued within a reasonable period</v>

587
00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:23.001
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are going to be out there </v>

588
00:31:23.001 --> 00:31:23.001
<v Speaker 1>for day after day after day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no water.</v>

589
00:31:23.001 --> 00:31:27.680
<v Speaker 1>And eventually think about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological torture that comes from </v>

590
00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.470
<v Speaker 1>being absolutely able to see almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but water.</v>

591
00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:36.060
<v Speaker 1>But you will go crazy and then die if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you start drinking the water around you.</v>

592
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

593
00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:42.080
<v Speaker 1>it's another kind of disaster movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's being stuck in the desert with </v>

594
00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.370
<v Speaker 1>water all around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's essentially poisonous.</v>

595
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

596
00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.360
<v Speaker 1>And there will come a time in the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I'm.</v>

597
00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.920
<v Speaker 1>And it's funny because it will spread </v>
<v Speaker 1>from one man to another where people </v>

598
00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.131
<v Speaker 1>will just start drinking the salt water </v>
<v Speaker 1>and knowingly die or be so crazed from </v>

599
00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Thursday they don't care.</v>

600
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:05.720
<v Speaker 1>One thing I found particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating about the shark aspect that </v>

601
00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.871
<v Speaker 1>stands and explains in his book was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that most of these sailors probably</v>

602
00:32:09.031 --> 00:32:14.031
<v Speaker 1>did not have a very clear conception of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharks the way we do.</v>

603
00:32:14.041 --> 00:32:16.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean jaws was the big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

604
00:32:16.531 --> 00:32:21.531
<v Speaker 1>sort of before and after moment on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we've been fascinated with sharks </v>

605
00:32:21.531 --> 00:32:24.741
<v Speaker 1>ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He points out that it was kind of the </v>

606
00:32:24.741 --> 00:32:26.931
<v Speaker 1>stuff of legends back in this era and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of confronting one had not been</v>

607
00:32:28.351 --> 00:32:30.870
<v Speaker 1>really talked about very often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's more,</v>

608
00:32:30.871 --> 00:32:35.871
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard says that the navy kind of </v>

609
00:32:35.871 --> 00:32:36.780
<v Speaker 1>downplayed the danger because it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for morale to talk about.</v>

610
00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could run into an 18 foot tiger </v>

611
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:42.020
<v Speaker 1>shark out there and they'll eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

612
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:47.010
<v Speaker 1>Stanton says that initially the sharks </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably mostly went after the cadavers </v>

613
00:32:47.411 --> 00:32:51.180
<v Speaker 1>in the water and that's why the real big</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks did not start for awhile.</v>

614
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.340
<v Speaker 1>But then once they ran out of those to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go after that,</v>

615
00:32:54.341 --> 00:32:59.110
<v Speaker 1>they started going after loan floaters </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the water as opposed to the ones that</v>

616
00:32:59.111 --> 00:33:03.400
<v Speaker 1>had all gathered into groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they would go after the ones at</v>

617
00:33:03.401 --> 00:33:05.070
<v Speaker 1>the outside of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

618
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:10.350
<v Speaker 1>the circle of people floating in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water stands and talks about,</v>

619
00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:14.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the incident that we just mentioned,</v>

620
00:33:14.411 --> 00:33:19.411
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sailor being cut in half below the </v>

621
00:33:19.411 --> 00:33:21.871
<v Speaker 1>waist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then says that there was a sailor </v>

622
00:33:21.871 --> 00:33:22.810
<v Speaker 1>who was on the verge of drowning that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was calling for help.</v>

623
00:33:22.811 --> 00:33:23.910
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

624
00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:27.550
<v Speaker 1>well let me let stand and pick up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

625
00:33:27.551 --> 00:33:28.240
<v Speaker 1>He writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

626
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:31.860
<v Speaker 3>at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bob Goss swam away from the group to aid</v>

627
00:33:31.861 --> 00:33:34.310
<v Speaker 3>and exhausted sailor who was on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>verge of drowning.</v>

628
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:38.120
<v Speaker 3>The boy had clearly gone out of his head</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the site of the fish,</v>

629
00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:43.121
<v Speaker 3>meaning the sharks circling below him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was waving his hands and calling for </v>

630
00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:44.250
<v Speaker 3>help.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As Gauze paddled out,</v>

631
00:33:44.251 --> 00:33:48.410
<v Speaker 3>he was intercepted immediately by a </v>
<v Speaker 3>large dorsal fin knifing towards him,</v>

632
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.900
<v Speaker 3>so he swam as fast as he could back to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the group.</v>

633
00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:55.010
<v Speaker 3>The boy in distressed soon disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As the shark attacks multiplied,</v>

634
00:33:55.610 --> 00:34:00.610
<v Speaker 3>stanton writes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones optimistic boys were filled </v>

635
00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:03.641
<v Speaker 3>with a sense of helplessness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jack Cassidy came face to face with a </v>

636
00:34:03.641 --> 00:34:07.271
<v Speaker 3>tiger shark that had been bothering him </v>
<v Speaker 3>for so long that he had even given it a </v>

637
00:34:07.271 --> 00:34:08.390
<v Speaker 3>name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He called the beast Oscar.</v>

638
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:13.570
<v Speaker 3>He swung at it with a homemade knife and</v>
<v Speaker 3>buried the blade and inch deep in the </v>

639
00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.010
<v Speaker 3>fish's tufts snout,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Oscar swam away as if only annoyed.</v>

640
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:18.950
<v Speaker 3>Cassidy was furious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to kill the shark,</v>

641
00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:23.180
<v Speaker 3>but he was relieved to be left alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As the water flashed with twisting tails</v>

642
00:34:23.181 --> 00:34:26.330
<v Speaker 3>and Dorsal fins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the boys resolve to stay calm,</v>

643
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:30.080
<v Speaker 3>clamping their hands over their ears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>against the erupting screams,</v>

644
00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:35.290
<v Speaker 3>but this resolve vanished when one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the boys was dragged through the water </v>

645
00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:36.500
<v Speaker 3>like a fisherman's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bob are tugged by a big catfish.</v>

646
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:41.600
<v Speaker 3>The victim clenched in the uplifted jaws</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a shark was pushed at waist level.</v>

647
00:34:41.601 --> 00:34:46.601
<v Speaker 3>Through the surf screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>others disappeared quietly without a </v>

648
00:34:46.601 --> 00:34:47.810
<v Speaker 3>trace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their life vests shooting back up to the</v>

649
00:34:47.811 --> 00:34:50.480
<v Speaker 3>surface,</v>
<v Speaker 3>empty the straps in shreds.</v>

650
00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:53.090
<v Speaker 3>As the excited sharks grew more </v>
<v Speaker 3>agitated,</v>

651
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.490
<v Speaker 3>the attacks intensified and ferocity</v>

652
00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:56.720
<v Speaker 1>and quote.</v>

653
00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:03.660
<v Speaker 1>There are many people who consider the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shark attacks over several days against </v>

654
00:35:04.211 --> 00:35:09.211
<v Speaker 1>the Indianapolis survivors' to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst incident of mass shark attacks in </v>

655
00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:15.090
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would suggest that that's a hard one </v>

656
00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:18.601
<v Speaker 1>to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think of how many ships have perished </v>

657
00:35:18.601 --> 00:35:23.580
<v Speaker 1>over the ages and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sharks are not a new phenomenon,</v>

658
00:35:23.591 --> 00:35:24.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

659
00:35:24.341 --> 00:35:29.341
<v Speaker 1>we have very few accounts like that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you add up all the various elements</v>

660
00:35:30.731 --> 00:35:35.731
<v Speaker 1>working on these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just imagine that no one could last </v>

661
00:35:36.791 --> 00:35:39.810
<v Speaker 1>long in that environment without losing </v>
<v Speaker 1>their mind.</v>

662
00:35:39.811 --> 00:35:42.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's what begins to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've seen this before,</v>

663
00:35:42.391 --> 00:35:42.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did a,</v>

664
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:48.320
<v Speaker 1>we mentioned one guy when we were doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>blueprint for armageddon in the first </v>

665
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:48.320
<v Speaker 1>world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

666
00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:49.340
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

667
00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:54.440
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sort of images make it into the </v>

668
00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:54.440
<v Speaker 1>history books and what sort of memories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

669
00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.090
<v Speaker 1>So you're in the first world war and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're at Passchendaele and you see some</v>

670
00:35:57.091 --> 00:36:02.091
<v Speaker 1>guy stuck in the mud and with all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things available to modern society at </v>

671
00:36:03.541 --> 00:36:08.541
<v Speaker 1>that point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't get him out and he's begging </v>

672
00:36:08.541 --> 00:36:10.050
<v Speaker 1>people to help him and no one can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

673
00:36:10.051 --> 00:36:13.290
<v Speaker 1>So then they come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot how many days later it was,</v>

674
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:17.760
<v Speaker 1>it might've only been one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the guy whose memory this was as the</v>

675
00:36:17.761 --> 00:36:21.180
<v Speaker 1>guy was still in the mud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he'd sunk all the way up to his head</v>

676
00:36:21.181 --> 00:36:24.120
<v Speaker 1>and he was insane begging people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot him.</v>

677
00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:27.640
<v Speaker 1>We all have a limit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

678
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:34.430
<v Speaker 1>So it should not surprise any of us when</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these people start losing their </v>

679
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.480
<v Speaker 1>minds in the water under these </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions and you know,</v>

680
00:36:36.481 --> 00:36:41.481
<v Speaker 1>you should also point out something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not always apparent when you're </v>

681
00:36:41.481 --> 00:36:44.151
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a 52 year old person now is </v>

682
00:36:44.151 --> 00:36:47.691
<v Speaker 1>really apparent to me is how young most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these people in this story are in my </v>

683
00:36:47.691 --> 00:36:48.960
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their kids,</v>

684
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.480
<v Speaker 1>the captains in adult and some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>officers are,</v>

685
00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:56.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old enough to have young families and </v>

686
00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.461
<v Speaker 1>whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although these people were having </v>

687
00:36:58.461 --> 00:36:58.461
<v Speaker 1>families at 18 years old back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them.</v>

688
00:36:58.461 --> 00:36:59.730
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of them were parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

689
00:36:59.731 --> 00:37:01.980
<v Speaker 1>when you read the biographies of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

690
00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:03.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

691
00:37:03.571 --> 00:37:06.000
<v Speaker 1>they're kids to me and you're 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

692
00:37:06.001 --> 00:37:08.970
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>21 and you're having to deal with this.</v>

693
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:13.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with von Moltke </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] line about,</v>

694
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:18.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we need war because it preserves </v>

695
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.030
<v Speaker 1>these human qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you sure see them on display here,</v>

696
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:19.780
<v Speaker 1>don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wish you'd never have to see them on</v>

697
00:37:19.781 --> 00:37:24.781
<v Speaker 1>display again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't help but marvel that </v>

698
00:37:24.781 --> 00:37:24.781
<v Speaker 1>people can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

699
00:37:24.781 --> 00:37:28.600
<v Speaker 1>get through this and many of them don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean stanton tell story after story </v>

700
00:37:29.261 --> 00:37:33.390
<v Speaker 1>about people that consciously decide to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give up that it's eaten.</v>

701
00:37:33.391 --> 00:37:38.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even talking about it with other </v>

702
00:37:38.391 --> 00:37:38.391
<v Speaker 1>people who are stuck in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's easy to do.</v>

703
00:37:38.391 --> 00:37:40.270
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says his swim away from the group and</v>

704
00:37:40.271 --> 00:37:42.520
<v Speaker 1>you will get hit by a shark within 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>yards.</v>

705
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:47.160
<v Speaker 1>People will drink the seawater knowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it will kill them.</v>

706
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:55.160
<v Speaker 1>Doug Stanton writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote those with broken arms and legs </v>

707
00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:58.410
<v Speaker 1>and backs had gone into shock and died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others had succumbed to massive bleeding</v>

708
00:37:58.411 --> 00:38:00.870
<v Speaker 1>or head wounds that suspended them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>another world.</v>

709
00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others simply drowned because they were </v>

710
00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:06.630
<v Speaker 1>too exhausted to keep swimming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd been afloat now without food,</v>

711
00:38:06.631 --> 00:38:07.410
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shelter,</v>

712
00:38:07.411 --> 00:38:11.640
<v Speaker 1>or sleep for over 40 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of the 1,196</v>

713
00:38:11.641 --> 00:38:14.670
<v Speaker 1>crew members who'd set sail from Guam </v>
<v Speaker 1>three days earlier,</v>

714
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:19.860
<v Speaker 1>probably no more than 600 were still </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive in the previous 24 hours alone.</v>

715
00:38:19.861 --> 00:38:24.861
<v Speaker 1>At least 200 had likely slip beneath the</v>
<v Speaker 1>waves or have been victims of shark </v>

716
00:38:24.861 --> 00:38:26.370
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since the sinking he writes,</v>

717
00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:31.580
<v Speaker 1>each boy had been floating through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours asking himself the same hard </v>

718
00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:35.331
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will I live or do I quit and it's </v>

719
00:38:35.331 --> 00:38:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday unfolded some of the starved </v>
<v Speaker 1>bleeding and delirious man began to form</v>

720
00:38:38.201 --> 00:38:42.310
<v Speaker 1>their answers for those who gave up </v>
<v Speaker 1>death now seem to matter of destiny.</v>

721
00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:44.230
<v Speaker 1>They started committing suicide.</v>

722
00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Those still lucid enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked on in disbelief.</v>

723
00:38:48.481 --> 00:38:53.481
<v Speaker 1>He writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as their former shipmates calmly untied </v>

724
00:38:53.481 --> 00:38:56.121
<v Speaker 1>their life vests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took a single stroke forward and sank </v>

725
00:38:56.121 --> 00:38:59.811
<v Speaker 1>without a word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others suddenly turned from the group </v>

726
00:38:59.811 --> 00:39:00.210
<v Speaker 1>and started swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for a shark to hit,</v>

727
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:02.790
<v Speaker 1>and then looked up and terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Satisfaction.</v>

728
00:39:02.791 --> 00:39:07.791
<v Speaker 1>When it did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>others simply fell face forward and </v>

729
00:39:07.791 --> 00:39:09.150
<v Speaker 1>refuse to rise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A boy would swim over to his buddy,</v>

730
00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:14.330
<v Speaker 1>lift his head by the hair from the water</v>
<v Speaker 1>and begin screaming for him to come to </v>

731
00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:17.481
<v Speaker 1>his senses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often he refused and continued to </v>

732
00:39:17.481 --> 00:39:20.301
<v Speaker 1>quietly drowned himself and quote no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should point out that there are </v>

733
00:39:21.671 --> 00:39:26.671
<v Speaker 1>people in every navy and the Second </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War that saw actual combat that </v>

734
00:39:26.671 --> 00:39:30.361
<v Speaker 1>had incidents like that and there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a few people in the merchant </v>

735
00:39:30.361 --> 00:39:32.650
<v Speaker 1>marine and the various civilian versions</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

736
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.380
<v Speaker 1>kept the supplies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

737
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:39.390
<v Speaker 1>coming across the water and handling the</v>
<v Speaker 1>logistics that would have their ships </v>

738
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:40.180
<v Speaker 1>torpedoed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would go through similar things.</v>

739
00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:46.960
<v Speaker 1>There's something perversely nasty about</v>
<v Speaker 1>having the water be warm enough to keep </v>

740
00:39:47.271 --> 00:39:52.271
<v Speaker 1>you alive for days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so giving you an opportunity to be </v>

741
00:39:52.271 --> 00:39:55.421
<v Speaker 1>rescued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never would have had in the North </v>

742
00:39:55.421 --> 00:39:57.910
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you'd be dead in an hour or two </v>

743
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:59.960
<v Speaker 1>from the hypothermia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also gives you time to go through</v>

744
00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:02.750
<v Speaker 1>what stand in just described.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>

745
00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.750
<v Speaker 1>multiple disaster movies all wrapped </v>
<v Speaker 1>into one.</v>

746
00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Now as the hours drag on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanton says that the delirium starts to</v>

747
00:40:14.961 --> 00:40:19.961
<v Speaker 1>set in and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Indianapolis survivors' are going </v>

748
00:40:19.961 --> 00:40:24.691
<v Speaker 1>through all of these movie tropes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever the movies will wrench drama and</v>

749
00:40:25.691 --> 00:40:30.460
<v Speaker 1>emotion and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your sense of feeling for the people.</v>

750
00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:33.760
<v Speaker 1>The fake people in these movies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories in the Indianapolis.</v>

751
00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:38.230
<v Speaker 1>People are going through it for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their ship went down,</v>

752
00:40:38.231 --> 00:40:40.750
<v Speaker 1>remember it like 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15:00</v>

753
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:45.750
<v Speaker 1>AM first thing in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the middle of the night on </v>

754
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:48.721
<v Speaker 1>Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanton writes that by Wednesday the men</v>

755
00:40:49.831 --> 00:40:53.970
<v Speaker 1>start attacking one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think they're seeing enemies and at</v>

756
00:40:53.971 --> 00:40:58.971
<v Speaker 1>one point he writes in an a and he says </v>
<v Speaker 1>in within 10 minutes an estimated 50 </v>

757
00:40:59.911 --> 00:41:04.911
<v Speaker 1>boys were killed by their compatriots </v>
<v Speaker 1>when everybody snapped at once.</v>

758
00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:08.310
<v Speaker 1>So we have another movie here too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the shipwreck movie.</v>

759
00:41:08.311 --> 00:41:10.560
<v Speaker 1>So it's another kind of disaster film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

760
00:41:10.561 --> 00:41:13.620
<v Speaker 1>people are stuck in rafts and dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with sharks and going crazy.</v>

761
00:41:13.621 --> 00:41:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Not having.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it says though,</v>

762
00:41:16.741 --> 00:41:21.741
<v Speaker 1>we tried to figure out how many things </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could hit the same people with </v>

763
00:41:21.741 --> 00:41:21.741
<v Speaker 1>before they broke</v>

764
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.670
<v Speaker 1>the higher human qualities that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>visible throughout.</v>

765
00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the part that got me was as,</v>

766
00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:36.040
<v Speaker 1>as people start dying more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need their lifevest because the </v>

767
00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:40.061
<v Speaker 1>life vests are failing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not meant to be in the water </v>

768
00:41:40.061 --> 00:41:41.981
<v Speaker 1>that long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have these stories about people </v>

769
00:41:41.981 --> 00:41:41.981
<v Speaker 1>that will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

770
00:41:41.981 --> 00:41:45.071
<v Speaker 1>go over and make sure someone that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is dead has actually expired and </v>

771
00:41:45.071 --> 00:41:48.260
<v Speaker 1>then take their life vest off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the one guy that stanton was quoting</v>

772
00:41:48.261 --> 00:41:48.920
<v Speaker 1>in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

773
00:41:48.921 --> 00:41:52.160
<v Speaker 1>he would not let them go without some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a prayer.</v>

774
00:41:52.161 --> 00:41:53.640
<v Speaker 1>He'd hold them close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>

775
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:58.660
<v Speaker 1>these guys are exhausted by this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anything more than the most minimum </v>

776
00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.560
<v Speaker 1>effort is excruciating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was going to see that each one of</v>

777
00:42:00.561 --> 00:42:03.700
<v Speaker 1>these people had a prayer set over them </v>
<v Speaker 1>before he let them go and you know,</v>

778
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:08.540
<v Speaker 1>to be eaten by the sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean those are the little touches in a</v>

779
00:42:08.541 --> 00:42:12.440
<v Speaker 1>story like this that break your heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>because those are the.</v>

780
00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:17.450
<v Speaker 1>That's what separates us from just being</v>
<v Speaker 1>some mindless thing that's torn apart by</v>

781
00:42:17.451 --> 00:42:22.451
<v Speaker 1>the sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the thinking that goes into all </v>

782
00:42:22.451 --> 00:42:22.451
<v Speaker 1>of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

783
00:42:22.451 --> 00:42:27.160
<v Speaker 1>that man survived the one that said the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prayers over the people he had to </v>

784
00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.080
<v Speaker 1>unstrap from the lifevest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you thinking about at night the</v>

785
00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:31.040
<v Speaker 1>rest of your life?</v>

786
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:39.010
<v Speaker 1>They will eventually be rescued by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pilot that they're not looking for </v>

787
00:42:39.111 --> 00:42:41.690
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pilot just kind of sees these people</v>

788
00:42:41.691 --> 00:42:42.380
<v Speaker 1>in the water</v>

789
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:43.320
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

790
00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:47.780
<v Speaker 1>Stan Lowe and he can see the sharks </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking them.</v>

791
00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Stanton rights of a guy named Lieutenant</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adrian marks who's,</v>

792
00:42:53.411 --> 00:42:55.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

793
00:42:55.080 --> 00:43:00.080
<v Speaker 1>one of the early people on the scene </v>
<v Speaker 1>once they figure out they've got people </v>

794
00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:00.790
<v Speaker 1>in the water and it's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the secrecy involved in this.</v>

795
00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.060
<v Speaker 3>They don't know who these people are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they're going,</v>

796
00:43:03.061 --> 00:43:05.630
<v Speaker 3>we found the Indianapolis crew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the first questions they're gonna</v>

797
00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:08.280
<v Speaker 3>ask when they pick the first person up </v>
<v Speaker 3>is who the hell are you and where you're</v>

798
00:43:08.281 --> 00:43:10.320
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a stanton writes,</v>

799
00:43:10.321 --> 00:43:15.321
<v Speaker 3>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lieutenant Adrian marks reached the </v>

800
00:43:15.321 --> 00:43:15.321
<v Speaker 3>scene of the survivors at 3:20</v>
<v Speaker 3>PM.</v>

801
00:43:15.321 --> 00:43:18.720
<v Speaker 3>And what he found astounded him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lieutenant Atterbury informed marks that</v>

802
00:43:18.721 --> 00:43:21.480
<v Speaker 3>there were a great many people scattered</v>
<v Speaker 3>over a wide area.</v>

803
00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:25.530
<v Speaker 3>He said not to drop any lifesaving </v>
<v Speaker 3>equipment until he made a full tour,</v>

804
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:30.680
<v Speaker 3>which marks quickly did both pilots then</v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to steer away from the people </v>

805
00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.270
<v Speaker 3>clinging to the rafts and to concentrate</v>
<v Speaker 3>on those,</v>

806
00:43:33.271 --> 00:43:36.660
<v Speaker 3>held up solely by vests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thirty minutes after he arrived,</v>

807
00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.570
<v Speaker 3>marks began bombing the boys with his </v>
<v Speaker 3>provisions.</v>

808
00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:43.860
<v Speaker 3>About the same time the destroyers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ralph Talbot and Madison received orders</v>

809
00:43:43.861 --> 00:43:48.861
<v Speaker 3>to cut short their patrols near the </v>
<v Speaker 3>island of a leafy and head directly to </v>

810
00:43:48.861 --> 00:43:48.861
<v Speaker 3>the rescue site.</v>

811
00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:53.970
<v Speaker 3>Their ETA 12 hours from the present </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometime early Friday morning marks knew</v>

812
00:43:53.971 --> 00:43:58.020
<v Speaker 3>the situation was dire from his recon </v>
<v Speaker 3>altitude of a mere 25 feet.</v>

813
00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:03.230
<v Speaker 3>He had a clear view of the deep green.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See in the hundreds of sharks circling </v>

814
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:04.440
<v Speaker 3>the men night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which he knew was the sharks.</v>

815
00:44:04.441 --> 00:44:07.570
<v Speaker 3>Normal feeding period was approaching </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of Mark's,</v>

816
00:44:07.571 --> 00:44:11.580
<v Speaker 3>his crew and watched as a shark attack </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the men and dragged him under.</v>

817
00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:15.510
<v Speaker 3>As Marx himself witnessed more attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His anxiety grew.</v>

818
00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.730
<v Speaker 3>It looked to him as if the survivors </v>
<v Speaker 3>were so weak,</v>

819
00:44:17.731 --> 00:44:20.700
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't even begin to fight back </v>
<v Speaker 3>and quote,</v>

820
00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.760
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a footnote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stanton and put in that says,</v>

821
00:44:23.761 --> 00:44:28.761
<v Speaker 3>the sharks had in fact remained a </v>
<v Speaker 3>constant presence throughout the men's </v>

822
00:44:28.761 --> 00:44:29.460
<v Speaker 3>ordeal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even during the daylight hours,</v>

823
00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 3>not long after Gwynn who was the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>pilot</v>

824
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.720
<v Speaker 1>to find the people in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

825
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:38.840
<v Speaker 1>not long after Gwyn showed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a massive shark attack involving an </v>

826
00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.680
<v Speaker 1>estimated 30 fish head in about 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

827
00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:43.560
<v Speaker 1>taken some 60 boys perched on a floater </v>
<v Speaker 1>net.</v>

828
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:48.920
<v Speaker 1>And to quote that doesn't begin to even </v>
<v Speaker 1>do justice to the parts of the story </v>

829
00:44:49.861 --> 00:44:54.540
<v Speaker 1>that seem by comparison with crap like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that to be nothing.</v>

830
00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you talk about no water and how </v>

831
00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:00.420
<v Speaker 1>that makes you feel day after day when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're suffering and no decent food.</v>

832
00:45:00.421 --> 00:45:01.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these no sleep,</v>

833
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:02.850
<v Speaker 1>the wounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

834
00:45:02.851 --> 00:45:04.780
<v Speaker 1>they said that one boy and one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>rafts,</v>

835
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:09.950
<v Speaker 1>one of the survivors couldn't help but </v>
<v Speaker 1>point out with sitting there with his </v>

836
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:12.420
<v Speaker 1>mouth wide open in such pain that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't even make a noise.</v>

837
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:17.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever been in a situation with a </v>

838
00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:18.720
<v Speaker 1>person like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just one person in one situation,</v>

839
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.620
<v Speaker 1>any one of these things is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

840
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:24.930
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about war,</v>

841
00:45:24.931 --> 00:45:28.320
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you think about is none </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this stuff should ever happen again.</v>

842
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:33.920
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing you think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that when it does look what people </v>

843
00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:38.901
<v Speaker 1>can endure and look at what they do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of self sacrifice for another </v>

844
00:45:39.421 --> 00:45:41.810
<v Speaker 1>human being who's in a situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

845
00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.790
<v Speaker 1>that's awful in a situation that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself might be sharing.</v>

846
00:45:44.791 --> 00:45:49.791
<v Speaker 1>So that's when it becomes extra heroic </v>
<v Speaker 1>when some of these people are doing </v>

847
00:45:49.791 --> 00:45:51.060
<v Speaker 1>things like giving their life vest to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who needs it more.</v>

848
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:54.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're doing a good deed </v>
<v Speaker 1>for someone you found on the street.</v>

849
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:59.750
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's reducing your own chances of </v>

850
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760
<v Speaker 1>survival to help somebody else's chances</v>
<v Speaker 1>of survival.</v>

851
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Those are pretty amazing stories and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the reason that we're so </v>

852
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:08.181
<v Speaker 1>fascinated with these horrible tales is </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something life affirming about </v>

853
00:46:08.181 --> 00:46:12.801
<v Speaker 1>the people that get through them and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>just how they conducted themselves at </v>

854
00:46:12.801 --> 00:46:15.450
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how it both changed them and how,</v>

855
00:46:15.451 --> 00:46:15.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

856
00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:20.730
<v Speaker 1>the silent heroism of living with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards and I think we have more </v>

857
00:46:21.001 --> 00:46:23.730
<v Speaker 1>understanding of that now than we used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to with things like ptsd,</v>

858
00:46:23.731 --> 00:46:27.240
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think we even give it </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere near the thought it deserves.</v>

859
00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:32.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all have traumatic memories in our </v>

860
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:33.240
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life provide you with some by default,</v>

861
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:36.690
<v Speaker 1>but some people get way more than their </v>
<v Speaker 1>share.</v>

862
00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine if like plugging </v>
<v Speaker 1>something in the back of your head,</v>

863
00:46:41.701 --> 00:46:46.701
<v Speaker 1>like from the Matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could upload the memories of one of </v>

864
00:46:46.701 --> 00:46:50.700
<v Speaker 1>these Indianapolis survivors' into your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just your brain,</v>

865
00:46:50.701 --> 00:46:55.701
<v Speaker 1>but like have it fused with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions so you know you have the </v>

866
00:46:55.701 --> 00:46:58.620
<v Speaker 1>feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have the flashbacks from an </v>

867
00:46:58.620 --> 00:46:59.700
<v Speaker 1>experience you never had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine what that would do to you pretty</v>

868
00:46:59.701 --> 00:47:01.110
<v Speaker 1>darn quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

869
00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I just gave you the memories of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indianapolis survivor.</v>

870
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine not being able to ever get them </v>

871
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:12.051
<v Speaker 1>out of your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine going through the original </v>

872
00:47:12.051 --> 00:47:12.051
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

873
00:47:12.051 --> 00:47:14.430
<v Speaker 1>my brain never wants to ever do any </v>
<v Speaker 1>research on this personally.</v>

874
00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:19.431
<v Speaker 1>You understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't help but wonder if somehow </v>

875
00:47:19.431 --> 00:47:23.300
<v Speaker 1>the cumulative effect over decades of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these horrible memories and </v>

876
00:47:25.621 --> 00:47:30.621
<v Speaker 1>flashbacks and nightmares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that ever come to equaling the </v>

877
00:47:30.621 --> 00:47:34.480
<v Speaker 1>terribleness of the experience itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it doesn't,</v>

878
00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.270
<v Speaker 1>how much of it is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

879
00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:40.520
<v Speaker 1>picking at the scab continually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

880
00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:43.060
<v Speaker 1>of the wound that changed your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

881
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Now we may not have gone through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wound,</v>

882
00:47:45.611 --> 00:47:50.611
<v Speaker 1>but think about how upset you'd be just </v>
<v Speaker 1>having the memories all of a sudden the </v>

883
00:47:50.611 --> 00:47:53.451
<v Speaker 1>implanted in your head about what it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you got it mentally or </v>

884
00:47:53.451 --> 00:47:57.010
<v Speaker 1>emotionally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my mind when you look at it,</v>

885
00:47:57.011 --> 00:48:02.011
<v Speaker 1>the sinking of the Indianapolis is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really a war story.</v>

886
00:48:02.291 --> 00:48:07.291
<v Speaker 1>If it was a war story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe we would have included it </v>

887
00:48:07.291 --> 00:48:09.661
<v Speaker 1>in the series that we're doing on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pacific war and the war in Asia in the </v>

888
00:48:09.661 --> 00:48:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Second World War right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like that in my mind.</v>

889
00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:17.760
<v Speaker 1>It's about as connected to war as I see </v>
<v Speaker 1>it as the nine slash 11 attacks were </v>

890
00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:21.580
<v Speaker 1>connected to terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are the thing that creates,</v>

891
00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:26.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first domino falling in a number of </v>

892
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:28.540
<v Speaker 1>horrible incidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once the initial attacks happen,</v>

893
00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:32.530
<v Speaker 1>you go from having a war movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'll pardon the connection again to</v>

894
00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:36.040
<v Speaker 1>entertainment to a disaster film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

895
00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:38.260
<v Speaker 1>like the kind I grew up with and as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

896
00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:43.860
<v Speaker 1>what is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if amazing is a good </v>

897
00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:44.320
<v Speaker 1>word to use in such a horrific </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

898
00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:49.321
<v Speaker 1>What is so frightful about what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indianapolis survivors' and non </v>

899
00:48:49.321 --> 00:48:53.650
<v Speaker 1>survivors had to go through is they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get to just have one disaster film</v>

900
00:48:53.651 --> 00:48:54.920
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

901
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.850
<v Speaker 1>they're traumatic memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get to walk out on one of these,</v>

902
00:48:58.450 --> 00:48:59.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies like,</v>

903
00:48:59.531 --> 00:48:59.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

904
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:04.140
<v Speaker 1>the towering inferno and get right on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

905
00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:07.230
<v Speaker 1>the Poseidon and then they get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience the poseidon adventure as one</v>

906
00:49:07.231 --> 00:49:08.730
<v Speaker 1>right after another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is as though,</v>

907
00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:10.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great gods of history,</v>

908
00:49:10.951 --> 00:49:15.951
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to see exactly how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could pile on the same group of </v>

909
00:49:15.951 --> 00:49:17.310
<v Speaker 1>human beings and since we're going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>a study here,</v>

910
00:49:17.311 --> 00:49:22.311
<v Speaker 1>why not have hundreds of people in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>sample size and see how much they can </v>

911
00:49:22.311 --> 00:49:23.640
<v Speaker 1>take and what happens to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

912
00:49:23.641 --> 00:49:28.641
<v Speaker 1>as you continue to give them as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>material as some of the people we pity </v>

913
00:49:29.341 --> 00:49:32.130
<v Speaker 1>them most for going through terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>human experiences.</v>

914
00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:35.570
<v Speaker 1>What several of them put together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced.</v>

915
00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:38.820
<v Speaker 1>That's why for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking about,</v>

916
00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible places in human history to have</v>

917
00:49:42.061 --> 00:49:47.061
<v Speaker 1>found yourself in or if your time </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine happens to go awry and you hit </v>

918
00:49:47.061 --> 00:49:48.960
<v Speaker 1>the button wrong and you end up in just </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the worst place you could.</v>

919
00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:54.470
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be anywhere from about July </v>

920
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.470
<v Speaker 1>30th to August,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>

921
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.600
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>45,</v>

922
00:49:55.350 --> 00:50:00.180
<v Speaker 1>a couple hundred miles from the nearest </v>
<v Speaker 1>land in the Philippines sea,</v>

923
00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:02.640
<v Speaker 1>and I would definitely say if that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to you,</v>

924
00:50:02.641 --> 00:50:07.641
<v Speaker 1>you would have found yourself for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular time and place in the worst </v>

925
00:50:07.641 --> 00:50:07.641
<v Speaker 1>place in the world.</v>

926
00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Audible has the largest selection of </v>
<v Speaker 1>audio books on the planet.</v>

927
00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:21.180
<v Speaker 1>What more do you need to know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really than that,</v>

928
00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:24.780
<v Speaker 1>when audible started sponsoring our </v>
<v Speaker 1>programs,</v>

929
00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:28.400
<v Speaker 1>they were in a similar situation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>where if somebody said,</v>

930
00:50:28.401 --> 00:50:33.401
<v Speaker 1>well you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said a podcaster and then had to </v>

931
00:50:33.401 --> 00:50:33.401
<v Speaker 1>explain that for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

932
00:50:33.401 --> 00:50:37.631
<v Speaker 1>once upon a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>audio books were something that people </v>

933
00:50:37.631 --> 00:50:40.751
<v Speaker 1>had to have explained to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now everybody understands audio books </v>

934
00:50:40.751 --> 00:50:42.770
<v Speaker 1>and so everyone understands audible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leading provider and.</v>

935
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give you an idea of selection,</v>

936
00:50:44.991 --> 00:50:46.940
<v Speaker 1>if you're ever worried about that sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

937
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:52.210
<v Speaker 1>They have multiple books and I mean I </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped counting at like five on the USS</v>

938
00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Indianapolis sinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's just call it an unmatched </v>

939
00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:02.680
<v Speaker 1>selection and if the story you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard acts as an appetizer towards </v>

940
00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:06.020
<v Speaker 1>finding out more and there's a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 1>audibles got plenty to choose from.</v>

941
00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:11.020
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually have the book we quoted </v>

942
00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:11.330
<v Speaker 1>from Stanton's book in harm's way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I've read in is incredible,</v>

943
00:51:11.331 --> 00:51:14.120
<v Speaker 1>but there's a bunch of other ones too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you read that or heard this story,</v>

944
00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get granular.</v>

945
00:51:15.711 --> 00:51:16.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

946
00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:19.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a new book that just came out on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Indianapolis,</v>

947
00:51:19.431 --> 00:51:21.440
<v Speaker 1>so you want some more information on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

948
00:51:21.441 --> 00:51:26.441
<v Speaker 1>You want to have somebody speak to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a little bit longer than this one </v>

949
00:51:26.441 --> 00:51:26.441
<v Speaker 1>lasted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

950
00:51:26.441 --> 00:51:28.790
<v Speaker 1>why don't you go to audible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sign up for their free trial,</v>

952
00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Text my name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do five,</v>

<v Speaker 1>zero five,</v>

956
00:51:38.181 --> 00:51:43.181

<v Speaker 1>I think I stopped counting at four or </v>

957
00:51:43.181 --> 00:51:44.180
<v Speaker 1>five books that they have on the sinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the USS Indianapolis.</v>

958
00:51:44.181 --> 00:51:49.181
<v Speaker 1>It's just one of those stories that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so hard to believe that it's true,</v>

959
00:51:49.251 --> 00:51:50.450
<v Speaker 1>and as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

960
00:51:50.451 --> 00:51:54.230
<v Speaker 1>there's almost this vicarious horror </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie fascination with it,</v>

961
00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:57.320
<v Speaker 1>and then it just breaks your heart to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually think that no,</v>

962
00:51:57.321 --> 00:52:02.321
<v Speaker 1>this is real stuff and the basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>information you're getting comes from </v>

963
00:52:02.321 --> 00:52:02.810
<v Speaker 1>the mouths of the people who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing this,</v>

964
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:07.160
<v Speaker 1>but that's what makes history so </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling.</v>

965
00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:10.610
<v Speaker 1>At least two people who have whatever it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

966
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:15.790
<v Speaker 1>the gene or just a sense of the dramatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a reason that this story </v>

967
00:52:17.091 --> 00:52:21.590
<v Speaker 1>continues to both fascinated but also </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspire.</v>

968
00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you go to audible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check out what they have available.</v>

<v Speaker 1>audible has in terms of advantages.</v>

973
00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:40.780

<v Speaker 1>these were the things that were new and </v>

974
00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:40.780
<v Speaker 1>unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you just sort of expect this sort of</v>
