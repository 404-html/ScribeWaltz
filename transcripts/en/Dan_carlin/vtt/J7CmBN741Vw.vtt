00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Because some bus,</v>

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:03.400
<v Speaker 2>it's history,</v>

3
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.790
<v Speaker 1>41,</v>

4
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.500
<v Speaker 3>a date which will live in infamy,</v>

5
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>perfect to the lead from this time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

6
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.780
<v Speaker 4>I take pride in the words Ich Bin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Alina</v>

7
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>The drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>

8
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.510
<v Speaker 1>welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This kind of examination because people </v>

9
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 1>have got to know whether or not their </v>
<v Speaker 1>president or crop,</v>

10
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.380
<v Speaker 1>if we dig deep in our history and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor and remember that we are not </v>

11
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 1>descended from fearful man.</v>

12
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.700
<v Speaker 2>It's hardcore history.</v>

13
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.660
<v Speaker 2>The dictionary defines the word laconic </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a form of speech that is blunt or </v>

14
00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:31.031
<v Speaker 2>pithy that uses an economy of words to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make a point and sometimes the point is </v>

15
00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:36.860
<v Speaker 2>particularly biting or on target or </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe mysterious,</v>

16
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.640
<v Speaker 2>and I love the word because the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>refers to a way of speaking that was </v>

17
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.160
<v Speaker 2>popular amongst a particular group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in Ancient Greece.</v>

18
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.940
<v Speaker 2>People known as lack of Demoniac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise known as spartans laconic </v>

19
00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:56.330
<v Speaker 2>speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spartan speech.</v>

20
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.730
<v Speaker 2>That's the way they're supposed to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked.</v>

21
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you know the love child of Clint</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eastwood and Batman,</v>

22
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.420
<v Speaker 2>and that's the way they spoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know man's gotTa know his </v>

23
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.620
<v Speaker 2>limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man's got to know his limitations.</v>

24
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.680
<v Speaker 2>Spartans are the kings of the one liners</v>
<v Speaker 2>in ancient Greek history and they are </v>

25
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.310
<v Speaker 2>cinematic and character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's not a movie maker out </v>

26
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.131
<v Speaker 2>there that wouldn't want Clint Eastwood </v>
<v Speaker 2>during his various movie years playing </v>

27
00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:29.870
<v Speaker 2>various forms of Spartans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

28
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:31.970
<v Speaker 2>from a Spaghetti Western era in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>twenties.</v>

29
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.020
<v Speaker 2>He could play your average spartan </v>
<v Speaker 2>warrior and he gets into the dirty Harry</v>

30
00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:37.130
<v Speaker 2>films,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

31
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:38.240
<v Speaker 2>72,</v>
<v Speaker 2>73,</v>

32
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:43.241
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>74 and he begins to age a little bit </v>

33
00:02:43.241 --> 00:02:45.311
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he plays one of those older spartan </v>

34
00:02:45.311 --> 00:02:45.311
<v Speaker 2>warriors and then you get him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

35
00:02:45.311 --> 00:02:48.851
<v Speaker 2>after the dirty Harry's or over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's an older man and now he's the </v>

36
00:02:48.851 --> 00:02:51.410
<v Speaker 2>king and he talks like he talks in all </v>
<v Speaker 2>his other movies combined with Batman.</v>

37
00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:52.490
<v Speaker 2>And you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

38
00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:57.491
<v Speaker 2>the way the spartans are supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have spoken laconically how cool is it </v>

39
00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 2>the 25 centuries after those people were</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the height of their fame and power.</v>

40
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 2>We still know the way they talked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's famous,</v>

41
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 2>it's famous because people wrote about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

42
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 2>People whose works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we still have</v>

43
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 2>telling you the way a certain people </v>
<v Speaker 2>spoke that long ago.</v>

44
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 2>Describing some of the things that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

45
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 2>all these sorts of little details help </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring color to the story.</v>

46
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:30.451
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they help us all relate to these people </v>

47
00:03:30.451 --> 00:03:32.761
<v Speaker 2>a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are human touches that flesh out </v>

48
00:03:32.761 --> 00:03:36.031
<v Speaker 2>these historical figures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you begin to get this sort of </v>

49
00:03:36.031 --> 00:03:40.111
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sorts of details that you were </v>

50
00:03:40.111 --> 00:03:42.541
<v Speaker 2>likely to hear in an oral tradition </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere in the world before this time </v>

51
00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:46.741
<v Speaker 2>period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you begin to get these stories </v>

52
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:49.201
<v Speaker 2>that have come down to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you begin to see truly cinematic type </v>

53
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:54.301
<v Speaker 2>creations stories that you could take </v>
<v Speaker 2>with very little changes and updating </v>

54
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 2>and make movies out of them today and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have them be popular</v>

55
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.060
<v Speaker 2>and it's not just the character </v>
<v Speaker 2>development either.</v>

56
00:04:02.061 --> 00:04:06.200
<v Speaker 2>The themes can be epic in these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take for example,</v>

57
00:04:06.201 --> 00:04:10.400
<v Speaker 2>the most famous story involving Sparta </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>

58
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.050
<v Speaker 2>The famous incident in for ADBC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He at the pass of Thermopylae,</v>

59
00:04:15.051 --> 00:04:20.051
<v Speaker 2>the so called hot gates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This may be because of the movies and </v>

60
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.230
<v Speaker 2>because of the books that have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>written forever.</v>

61
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.590
<v Speaker 2>This may be the earliest confirmable </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical event.</v>

62
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 2>Most Americans know about the defensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>300 spartans against a million or so </v>

63
00:04:30.981 --> 00:04:35.981
<v Speaker 2>Persians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a battle that some have described over </v>

64
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:40.040
<v Speaker 2>the era's for the existence of Western </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>

65
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.440
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if those are the stakes,</v>

66
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.860
<v Speaker 2>whose side are you rooting for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>

67
00:04:45.861 --> 00:04:48.290
<v Speaker 2>The India leader Mohandas Gandhi </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposedly said,</v>

68
00:04:48.291 --> 00:04:51.050
<v Speaker 2>when someone asked him what he thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Western civilization,</v>

69
00:04:51.051 --> 00:04:53.600
<v Speaker 2>didn't he say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be a good idea.</v>

70
00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way this story is framed from the </v>

71
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.190
<v Speaker 2>get go is designed to have you affiliate</v>
<v Speaker 2>with one side over.</v>

72
00:05:02.191 --> 00:05:07.191
<v Speaker 2>The other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One side is like the plucky little </v>

73
00:05:07.191 --> 00:05:09.861
<v Speaker 2>republic with Luke Skywalker in star </v>
<v Speaker 2>wars and their beleaguered and you know </v>

74
00:05:09.861 --> 00:05:14.601
<v Speaker 2>they're good and they're under pressure </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're trying to survive against </v>

75
00:05:14.601 --> 00:05:18.231
<v Speaker 2>darth vader and the empire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That will sniff out all freedom and hope</v>

76
00:05:18.691 --> 00:05:21.060
<v Speaker 2>and happiness and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those kinds of things.</v>

77
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.720
<v Speaker 2>That's the way the ancient story is </v>
<v Speaker 2>handled.</v>

78
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Have what are called the Greek and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Persian wars.</v>

79
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.090
<v Speaker 2>A moment that has sometimes been </v>
<v Speaker 2>portrayed in apocalyptic terms for what </v>

80
00:05:35.511 --> 00:05:38.390
<v Speaker 2>is sometimes been called the West once </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon a time.</v>

81
00:05:38.391 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Christendom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so already many in the West are going to</v>

82
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:46.390
<v Speaker 2>feel like it's a sporting event and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're the home team,</v>

83
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:51.391
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all homeowners when it comes to </v>

84
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:53.131
<v Speaker 2>the Greek and Persian wars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless of course you're more like the </v>

85
00:05:53.131 --> 00:05:54.970
<v Speaker 2>people who were portrayed as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Persians back then remember,</v>

86
00:05:54.971 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 2>this is not just an ethnic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a values</v>

87
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.700
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and in the narrative sometimes called </v>

88
00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.831
<v Speaker 5>the grand narrative by some greases,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting for things like liberty and </v>

89
00:06:05.831 --> 00:06:10.721
<v Speaker 5>freedom and democracy and artistic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean everything that the evil empire </v>

90
00:06:10.721 --> 00:06:14.801
<v Speaker 5>isn't evil.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Empire will sniff it all out and make </v>

91
00:06:14.801 --> 00:06:14.801
<v Speaker 5>slaves of everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So who are you going to side with?</v>

92
00:06:14.801 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The story of [inaudible] is one of those</v>

93
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:23.711
<v Speaker 5>that is absolutely dramatic beyond </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything you get in earlier history and </v>

94
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 5>it's because you have a master </v>
<v Speaker 5>storyteller.</v>

95
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.910
<v Speaker 5>Imparting the story to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I started in news reporting and </v>

96
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.451
<v Speaker 5>editor said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your job is to relate the facts of the </v>

97
00:06:34.451 --> 00:06:36.620
<v Speaker 5>story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the true information,</v>

98
00:06:36.621 --> 00:06:39.020
<v Speaker 5>and do so in the most compelling way you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can.</v>

99
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.800
<v Speaker 5>If you imagine the battle of Thermopylae</v>
<v Speaker 5>as written by,</v>

100
00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:47.801
<v Speaker 5>say the scribes of Babylonia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might sound like this,</v>

101
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.920
<v Speaker 5>in the 14th year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the king of lands by the will of Marduk </v>

102
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 5>overcame the Spartan army at a place </v>
<v Speaker 5>called the hot gates.</v>

103
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.550
<v Speaker 5>Two hundred 97 of the enemy were </v>
<v Speaker 5>counted.</v>

104
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.760
<v Speaker 5>The Spartan King went to his destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Babylonians had been writing that </v>

105
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:06.800
<v Speaker 5>way forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were great.</v>

106
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.100
<v Speaker 5>Record keepers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Things were a little dry though.</v>

107
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.800
<v Speaker 5>Now north of them were the Assyrians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a culture that existed sort of alongside</v>

108
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:20.801
<v Speaker 5>the Babylonians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot more aggressive and big on the </v>

109
00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:23.540
<v Speaker 5>propaganda front and didn't mind </v>
<v Speaker 5>shoveling people's nose in their defeats</v>

110
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:27.560
<v Speaker 5>and they like to maintain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shall we call a muscular foreign policy.</v>

111
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.040
<v Speaker 5>There's what sounded a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 5>like darth vader's pr from issuing a </v>

112
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:38.051
<v Speaker 5>press release.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would have described the battle of </v>

113
00:07:38.051 --> 00:07:38.630
<v Speaker 5>thermopylae like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a storm.</v>

114
00:07:38.631 --> 00:07:42.380
<v Speaker 5>I overthrew them all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I slew their king.</v>

115
00:07:42.381 --> 00:07:46.840
<v Speaker 5>I crucified their land.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I devastated that.</v>

116
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.870
<v Speaker 5>You may notice that there's not a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>character development there and less </v>

117
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:56.441
<v Speaker 5>making the king of Assyria.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Frightfully terrifying is the </v>

118
00:07:56.441 --> 00:07:58.160
<v Speaker 5>development you're after.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nonetheless,</v>

119
00:07:58.161 --> 00:08:03.161
<v Speaker 5>as I said in this story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>darth vader's really the only character </v>

120
00:08:03.161 --> 00:08:06.791
<v Speaker 5>on the other side that gets fleshed out </v>
<v Speaker 5>very much compare the sample Babylonian </v>

121
00:08:08.061 --> 00:08:13.061
<v Speaker 5>and the Syrian approaches to this story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to something like the description you </v>

122
00:08:13.061 --> 00:08:17.330
<v Speaker 5>get from people like Heraclitus of </v>
<v Speaker 5>helicon Asas sometimes called the father</v>

123
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:19.910
<v Speaker 5>of histories,</v>
<v Speaker 5>occasionally called the father of lies,</v>

124
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:25.360
<v Speaker 5>writing his history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a generation after the events at their </v>

125
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:25.360
<v Speaker 5>mop Ali.</v>

126
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.380
<v Speaker 5>He talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the spartans blocking this </v>

127
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.531
<v Speaker 5>road,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's a tale that has developed </v>

128
00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:35.711
<v Speaker 5>over the hundreds of years afterwards of</v>
<v Speaker 5>an event that people have been adding a </v>

129
00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:37.850
<v Speaker 5>few screen writing touches to since the </v>
<v Speaker 5>very beginning.</v>

130
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.450
<v Speaker 5>As the story is often told,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a bunch of Greeks trying to </v>

131
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.640
<v Speaker 5>block the army of the Persians from </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming into southern Greece.</v>

132
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:51.020
<v Speaker 5>Xerxes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the crack of doom named Persian king,</v>

133
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.430
<v Speaker 5>the only truly free person in his whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>society.</v>

134
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.940
<v Speaker 5>The story would have you believe rules </v>
<v Speaker 5>all of Asia and so many other lands that</v>

135
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:04.941
<v Speaker 5>he is entitled a King of Kings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All his people or the equivalent of </v>

136
00:09:04.941 --> 00:09:09.861
<v Speaker 5>slaves who can live or die on his whim </v>
<v Speaker 5>and when he orders them to fight the </v>

137
00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:14.361
<v Speaker 5>spartans in this past,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they obey and our whipped by overseers </v>

138
00:09:14.361 --> 00:09:18.861
<v Speaker 5>onto the spears of the spartans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The last stand is it's called a </v>

139
00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 5>thermopylae.</v>

140
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.430
<v Speaker 5>The greatest last stand probably in all </v>
<v Speaker 5>human history was not supposed to be the</v>

141
00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:25.980
<v Speaker 5>kind of last stand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It turned out to be there with thousands</v>

142
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:28.230
<v Speaker 5>of Greek soldiers at their monopoly </v>
<v Speaker 5>initially,</v>

143
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.490
<v Speaker 5>but eventually it became apparent that </v>
<v Speaker 5>it was going to be a death trap.</v>

144
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.340
<v Speaker 5>And so the Spartan King,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a guy named Leon,</v>

145
00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:40.341
<v Speaker 5>he does supposedly sent the other Greeks</v>
<v Speaker 5>away and kept a sort of rear guard.</v>

146
00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:45.711
<v Speaker 5>If you want to stick with the narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a rear guard for Greek and western </v>

147
00:09:45.711 --> 00:09:49.041
<v Speaker 5>freedom behind to hold off the Persians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were other Greeks who were </v>

148
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:52.050
<v Speaker 5>involved in the so called last stand at </v>
<v Speaker 5>thermopylae,</v>

149
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.360
<v Speaker 5>but it's the spartans who get the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>attention,</v>

150
00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:56.430
<v Speaker 5>about 300 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>

151
00:09:56.431 --> 00:10:00.450
<v Speaker 5>you can understand why as characters </v>
<v Speaker 5>they were fascinating in their own time.</v>

152
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.660
<v Speaker 5>The spartans are a kind of a cultural </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiment.</v>

153
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.110
<v Speaker 5>A better way to put it is when you think</v>
<v Speaker 5>about all human history together,</v>

154
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:12.380
<v Speaker 5>there's enough law of averages stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>working where you can see all kinds of </v>

155
00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.910
<v Speaker 5>little human experiments going on in </v>
<v Speaker 5>various communities in Sparta.</v>

156
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:20.480
<v Speaker 5>It's whether or not the culture can </v>
<v Speaker 5>infuse a certain fighting quality too.</v>

157
00:10:20.581 --> 00:10:22.860
<v Speaker 5>It's human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they grow up a certain way,</v>

158
00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:27.861
<v Speaker 5>pressured by the culture in certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>facets that just make them more likely </v>

159
00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:32.430
<v Speaker 5>to be extremely nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In Combat Spartan Warrior Sparty,</v>

160
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:35.100
<v Speaker 5>it's do nothing but fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is no other job for them.</v>

161
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:40.430
<v Speaker 5>The entire culture seems to be designed </v>
<v Speaker 5>from much of what we know now to </v>

162
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.961
<v Speaker 5>reinforce this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including a code of laws and behavior </v>

163
00:10:44.961 --> 00:10:49.520
<v Speaker 5>that tended to make these spartans </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough alike so that laconic became a </v>

164
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.820
<v Speaker 5>term that described.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

165
00:10:50.821 --> 00:10:55.821
<v Speaker 5>most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not a lot of chatty spartans in </v>

166
00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:55.821
<v Speaker 5>history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The culture didn't encourage that.</v>

167
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:58.710
<v Speaker 5>Listened to the color though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's come down from this story.</v>

168
00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:04.490
<v Speaker 5>The great kings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>xerxes with his army reported to be a </v>

169
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.930
<v Speaker 5>million men so large that it drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The river is dry that it passes through,</v>

170
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.250
<v Speaker 5>comes to this road with this past that </v>
<v Speaker 5>has to be crossed,</v>

171
00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:15.570
<v Speaker 5>and these small group of Greek hoplites </v>
<v Speaker 5>guarding it and xerxes,</v>

172
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.080
<v Speaker 5>according to Hurghada tests,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't know what to do,</v>

173
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.690
<v Speaker 5>can't quite believe what he seeing.</v>

174
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.860
<v Speaker 5>Look at the color in the story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>According to Hurghada,</v>

175
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.740
<v Speaker 5>xerxes sends a spy to go up to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>spartan lines and try to figure out </v>

176
00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.210
<v Speaker 5>what's going on and not get caught.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not only does he not get caught,</v>

177
00:11:36.211 --> 00:11:41.211
<v Speaker 5>but according to Herat at this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he reports back to xerxes and says that </v>

178
00:11:41.211 --> 00:11:41.340
<v Speaker 5>the Spartan warriors couldn't have cared</v>
<v Speaker 5>less,</v>

179
00:11:41.341 --> 00:11:43.260
<v Speaker 5>that he was there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were fine with him looking around.</v>

180
00:11:43.261 --> 00:11:48.261
<v Speaker 5>They didn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said they were doing exercises and </v>

181
00:11:48.261 --> 00:11:48.600
<v Speaker 5>combing their hair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

182
00:11:48.601 --> 00:11:53.601
<v Speaker 5>you have to imagine clint eastwood with </v>
<v Speaker 5>long hair and a beard right there.</v>

183
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 5>That'd</v>

184
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 2>be worth the price of admission right </v>
<v Speaker 2>with his tall sinewy guy,</v>

185
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:01.150
<v Speaker 2>not a big muscle bound guy doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodyweight exercises.</v>

186
00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:02.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calisthenics,</v>

187
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 2>pushups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sit ups,</v>

188
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:09.660
<v Speaker 2>gymnastics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they prepped and the combing </v>

189
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.980
<v Speaker 2>the long hair was a spartan thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>XERXES could not get his mind around.</v>

190
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Hurghada is basically says the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>

191
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:19.950
<v Speaker 2>a couple hundred of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to try to take on his </v>

192
00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:21.040
<v Speaker 2>reportedly million man army,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he calls in an advisor that he has.</v>

193
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:26.610
<v Speaker 2>He's got a spartan king with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy who fell out of favor and he </v>

194
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:30.901
<v Speaker 2>hooked up with the Persians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking that if they conquer all the </v>

195
00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:30.901
<v Speaker 2>grease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be good for him.</v>

196
00:12:30.901 --> 00:12:33.700
<v Speaker 2>He's been the advisor to the great king </v>
<v Speaker 2>of kings up till now.</v>

197
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:38.470
<v Speaker 2>He had told the king earlier about these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and they'd made fun of him,</v>

198
00:12:38.471 --> 00:12:42.340
<v Speaker 2>so now xerxes called him back to report </v>
<v Speaker 2>on what the spy had said.</v>

199
00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.360
<v Speaker 2>The spartans were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll let hirata tests.</v>

200
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.710
<v Speaker 2>This ancient screenwriter handled the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story from their writing.</v>

201
00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Twenty 500 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quote xerxes listened,</v>

202
00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:00.060
<v Speaker 2>but could not understand that the lack </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Simonian's we're really preparing to </v>

203
00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:03.430
<v Speaker 2>kill or be killed to fight as much as </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in their power,</v>

204
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.270
<v Speaker 2>seemed to him to be the height of folly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the action of fools.</v>

205
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.010
<v Speaker 2>So he sent for Dme,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maritou,</v>

206
00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:12.790
<v Speaker 2>son of aristotle who was in the camp and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when to meritus arrived.</v>

207
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.490
<v Speaker 2>Xerxes questioned him about everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>he had been told,</v>

208
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.700
<v Speaker 2>trying to understand the meaning behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the lack of Simonian's we're doing </v>

209
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.510
<v Speaker 2>to tomorrow answered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You heard what I said about these men </v>

210
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.081
<v Speaker 2>before when we were just setting out </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the Greeks and you made me a </v>

211
00:13:28.081 --> 00:13:30.430
<v Speaker 2>laughing stock when you heard my view of</v>
<v Speaker 2>how these matters would turn out,</v>

212
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.910
<v Speaker 2>but it is my greatest goal to tell the </v>
<v Speaker 2>truth in your presence,</v>

213
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.110
<v Speaker 2>so hear me now.</v>

214
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.290
<v Speaker 2>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these men have come to fight for control</v>

215
00:13:38.291 --> 00:13:41.890
<v Speaker 2>of the road and that is really what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are preparing to do for it.</v>

216
00:13:41.891 --> 00:13:46.891
<v Speaker 2>Is there a tradition that they groom </v>
<v Speaker 2>their hair whenever they are about to </v>

217
00:13:46.891 --> 00:13:47.110
<v Speaker 2>put their lives in danger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now know this,</v>

218
00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.250
<v Speaker 2>if you subjugate these men and those who</v>
<v Speaker 2>have remained behind in Sparta,</v>

219
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:56.430
<v Speaker 2>there is no other race of human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>that will be left to raise their hands </v>

220
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:57.040
<v Speaker 2>against you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For you are now attacking the most noble</v>

221
00:13:57.041 --> 00:13:59.560
<v Speaker 2>kingdom of all the Greeks and the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>of men.</v>

222
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:04.600
<v Speaker 2>What to Maritou said Hirata test rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed quite incredible.</v>

223
00:14:04.601 --> 00:14:09.601
<v Speaker 2>Dessert sees and he asked for a second </v>
<v Speaker 2>time how they could possibly intend to </v>

224
00:14:09.601 --> 00:14:12.820
<v Speaker 2>fight his whole army since there were so</v>
<v Speaker 2>few of them to Mera toast,</v>

225
00:14:12.821 --> 00:14:14.290
<v Speaker 2>replied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sire.</v>

226
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.420
<v Speaker 2>If things do not turn out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as I claim,</v>

227
00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:21.421
<v Speaker 2>they will treat me like a liar and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>quote to lie to the great king of kings,</v>

228
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.180
<v Speaker 2>of the acumen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Persian empire was a capital crime.</v>

229
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:33.690
<v Speaker 2>He was basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this doesn't turn out exactly like I </v>

230
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:33.690
<v Speaker 2>told you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will.</v>

231
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.790
<v Speaker 2>You can kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty darn colorful right there,</v>

232
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.680
<v Speaker 2>but it gets even better.</v>

233
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.520
<v Speaker 2>The Great King of the Persians were </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to send a messenger to the </v>

234
00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.420
<v Speaker 2>spartan lines to King Leona and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>

235
00:14:48.421 --> 00:14:51.030
<v Speaker 2>join us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll make you the overlords.</v>

236
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll have more than you ever had </v>

237
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.110
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of nations had done that.</v>

238
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Joining the Persian empire was not a bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

239
00:14:56.841 --> 00:14:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes he's basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can make a deal here.</v>

240
00:14:59.121 --> 00:15:01.520
<v Speaker 2>It'll be worth your while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His father dairy,</v>

241
00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:04.370
<v Speaker 2>this was a great deal maker in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>xerxes,</v>

242
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:09.371
<v Speaker 2>was coming from a position of </v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiation here and the spartans </v>

243
00:15:09.371 --> 00:15:12.560
<v Speaker 2>basically dressed him down morally </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying something to the effect of,</v>

244
00:15:12.561 --> 00:15:14.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have all this land already,</v>

245
00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:19.211
<v Speaker 2>but you need to bother us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd rather die for Greece than own </v>

246
00:15:19.211 --> 00:15:19.400
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of those wonderful spartan,</v>

247
00:15:19.401 --> 00:15:20.660
<v Speaker 2>moralistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putdowns.</v>

248
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spoken with as few words as possible and</v>

249
00:15:25.711 --> 00:15:29.790
<v Speaker 2>then famously as recorded by plutarch's </v>
<v Speaker 2>600 years after the event,</v>

250
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.880
<v Speaker 2>surrogacy sends another messenger to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spartan lines,</v>

251
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:37.940
<v Speaker 2>supposedly another message for the king </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the spartans and says to all the men </v>

252
00:15:38.791 --> 00:15:40.830
<v Speaker 2>who can hear them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can all go home,</v>

253
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:46.540
<v Speaker 2>all will be forgiven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just put down your arms and then you get</v>

254
00:15:46.541 --> 00:15:51.541
<v Speaker 2>the wonderful phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Milan of a translated in many different </v>

255
00:15:53.111 --> 00:15:54.730
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it just is good.</v>

256
00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.490
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much any of them come and take </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

257
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Lay down your arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come and take them.</v>

258
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
<v Speaker 2>Come and get them having come take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can take them when we're all dead.</v>

259
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.360
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difficult to translate.</v>

260
00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Greek is used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still,</v>

261
00:16:12.611 --> 00:16:15.460
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the motto of the Greek First Army Corps,</v>

262
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:20.940
<v Speaker 2>it's been used for many causes all </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout history cause it's such a </v>

263
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:21.190
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatic,</v>

264
00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.980
<v Speaker 2>colorful spit in the face of death line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

265
00:16:23.981 --> 00:16:27.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a clint eastwood line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel lucky?</v>

266
00:16:27.251 --> 00:16:32.251
<v Speaker 2>Punk come and take them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you not stand up in the theater </v>

267
00:16:32.251 --> 00:16:34.710
<v Speaker 2>and cheer when that moment hits?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's every screenwriter,</v>

268
00:16:34.711 --> 00:16:37.390
<v Speaker 2>his dream to have a scenario like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if it can be true,</v>

269
00:16:37.391 --> 00:16:42.391
<v Speaker 2>how wonderful is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Greek chroniclers who wrote about </v>

270
00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:46.240
<v Speaker 2>this stuff did not skimp on the drama </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it makes it colorful.</v>

271
00:16:46.241 --> 00:16:49.000
<v Speaker 2>It makes it real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes it compelling even 2,500</v>

272
00:16:49.001 --> 00:16:54.001
<v Speaker 2>years later and you give your right arm </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have this kind of stuff right out of </v>

273
00:16:54.761 --> 00:16:59.761
<v Speaker 2>the mouths of the oral historians from </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these places that didn't have them </v>

274
00:16:59.761 --> 00:17:03.940
<v Speaker 2>and look black and white because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Persian story must be magical.</v>

275
00:17:03.941 --> 00:17:08.941
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have that story and </v>

276
00:17:08.941 --> 00:17:10.540
<v Speaker 2>traditionally it's difficult for us to </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that.</v>

277
00:17:10.541 --> 00:17:15.541
<v Speaker 2>We'd like to hear from a pro perspective</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story of Darth vader and the empire,</v>

278
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.480
<v Speaker 2>but throughout history they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>always darth vader and some of the </v>

279
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.380
<v Speaker 2>greatest chroniclers of all time have </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone to great lengths to show in fact </v>

280
00:17:25.661 --> 00:17:29.860
<v Speaker 2>that they may have been on God's side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will.</v>

281
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.660
<v Speaker 2>If that turns out to be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's side are you rooting for them?</v>

282
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Of course in this time period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Iron Age,</v>

283
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:44.860
<v Speaker 2>ancient world and in this area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mediterranean and the Near East,</v>

284
00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to be a heck of a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 2>specific when you start talking about </v>

285
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.551
<v Speaker 2>dvds to just say God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The likely response during that era </v>

286
00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:57.831
<v Speaker 2>might've been which God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a wild and crazy time for </v>

287
00:17:58.231 --> 00:18:03.231
<v Speaker 2>religion in that part of the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a lot of different ones and </v>

288
00:18:03.231 --> 00:18:06.021
<v Speaker 2>they ran the gamut from things you might</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand today too wild and crazy and </v>

289
00:18:06.021 --> 00:18:10.971
<v Speaker 2>everything in between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of these religious beliefs had a </v>

290
00:18:10.971 --> 00:18:12.240
<v Speaker 2>pantheon of gods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of them.</v>

291
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Some of them had a sort of a dominant </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave God,</v>

292
00:18:15.181 --> 00:18:16.290
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but having,</v>

293
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple gods was normal.</v>

294
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.010
<v Speaker 2>There were groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially one known for only having one</v>

295
00:18:23.011 --> 00:18:28.011
<v Speaker 2>God and they were the ones that put </v>
<v Speaker 2>together with divine or without divine </v>

296
00:18:28.591 --> 00:18:31.860
<v Speaker 2>help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take your pick a tome,</v>

297
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:37.730
<v Speaker 2>a combination of catalog of events and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories and accounts and perspectives </v>

298
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.400
<v Speaker 2>and admonitions and hymns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's hard to describe exactly what </v>

299
00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:48.600
<v Speaker 2>the old Hebrew Bible is.</v>

300
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.090
<v Speaker 2>It's also hard to know when it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>written,</v>

301
00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:56.160
<v Speaker 2>are the accounts from the period around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time the Persians first appeared on </v>

302
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.931
<v Speaker 2>the scene legitimate from that period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most Biblical experts think they were </v>

303
00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:01.650
<v Speaker 2>written later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

304
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.860
<v Speaker 2>we use plutonic 500 years after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact,</v>

305
00:19:04.861 --> 00:19:09.861
<v Speaker 2>and so does everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when the old Hebrew Bible in multiple</v>

306
00:19:10.861 --> 00:19:15.861
<v Speaker 2>places talks about the Persians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should probably at least note the </v>

307
00:19:15.861 --> 00:19:18.060
<v Speaker 2>attitude and the attitude that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>writers,</v>

308
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.270
<v Speaker 2>whomever they may have been of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>works had toward the Persians,</v>

309
00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:23.730
<v Speaker 2>especially early on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't just positive.</v>

310
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.870
<v Speaker 2>It was divine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meany,</v>

311
00:19:27.871 --> 00:19:29.370
<v Speaker 2>meany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technical.</v>

312
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:34.430
<v Speaker 2>You farson number number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight divisions.</v>

313
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.960
<v Speaker 2>That's my favorite part of the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Old Hebrew Bible,</v>

314
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:42.210
<v Speaker 2>which is so full of wonderful stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

315
00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.850
<v Speaker 2>the Greeks don't have the market totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>cornered on color.</v>

316
00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:50.330
<v Speaker 2>There's just not a ton of stuff from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of the world during the time </v>

317
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.680
<v Speaker 2>period represented by the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but remember there's a lot of discussion</v>

318
00:19:52.681 --> 00:19:55.350
<v Speaker 2>over when various pieces of the Bible </v>
<v Speaker 2>were written.</v>

319
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.400
<v Speaker 2>A lot of this good stuff might've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>written in well into the pros periods.</v>

320
00:19:59.401 --> 00:20:04.401
<v Speaker 2>So we've entered into the color era </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's so much color on the </v>

321
00:20:04.401 --> 00:20:06.480
<v Speaker 2>book of Daniel has this scary story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spooky story.</v>

322
00:20:06.481 --> 00:20:08.940
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a horror movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a spooky movie.</v>

323
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:12.660
<v Speaker 2>And today you'd have to have a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>CGI helped to make it work.</v>

324
00:20:12.661 --> 00:20:17.661
<v Speaker 2>But it's my favorite scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's out of the book of Daniel and it </v>

325
00:20:17.661 --> 00:20:19.950
<v Speaker 2>involves a ghostly hand writing words on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wall,</v>

326
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.810
<v Speaker 2>meany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meany tackle.</v>

327
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:26.930
<v Speaker 2>You farson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to back up a little bit in </v>

328
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:28.440
<v Speaker 2>the story to set the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the king of Babylon,</v>

329
00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.550
<v Speaker 2>who the Bible Calls Belshazzar is having</v>
<v Speaker 2>a party,</v>

330
00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:37.590
<v Speaker 2>he and his buddies and some concubines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way the Bible puts it.</v>

331
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:39.840
<v Speaker 2>Probably have to imagine some loud </v>
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>

332
00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

333
00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.300
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's booze.</v>

334
00:20:42.301 --> 00:20:47.301
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're drinking and at a certain point </v>

335
00:20:47.301 --> 00:20:49.760
<v Speaker 2>the king of Babylon wants to really nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>silver were brought in and the big cups </v>

336
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:54.810
<v Speaker 2>of gold and silver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones they took from Jerusalem when </v>

337
00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:56.470
<v Speaker 2>they sacked the capital of Judah not </v>
<v Speaker 2>that long ago,</v>

338
00:20:56.471 --> 00:20:58.210
<v Speaker 2>because that's what the Babylonians had </v>
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

339
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:04.300
<v Speaker 2>scattered a bunch of Jews everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forced a lot of the premier families and</v>

340
00:21:04.301 --> 00:21:09.301
<v Speaker 2>craftsmen and artisans to deport all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way back to Babylon and destroyed </v>

341
00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:13.090
<v Speaker 2>Solomon's temple when it comes to pr.</v>

342
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:18.360
<v Speaker 2>This belshazzar guy and the Babylonians </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not getting a ton of it positive </v>

343
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.800
<v Speaker 2>from the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And while he's drinking out of his big,</v>

344
00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:22.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alluded cup,</v>

345
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:27.600
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with the concubines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden the ghostly hand with a </v>

346
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.191
<v Speaker 2>finger appears right under the lamp and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it starts writing on a wall,</v>

347
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.080
<v Speaker 2>meany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meany tackle.</v>

348
00:21:35.081 --> 00:21:37.840
<v Speaker 2>You farson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And everybody freaks out.</v>

349
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:43.800
<v Speaker 2>My King James version of the Bible makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sound like he essentially couldn't </v>

350
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.700
<v Speaker 2>control his bowels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was so scared.</v>

351
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.770
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

352
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:51.810
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more colloquial version just sticks to </v>

353
00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:52.960
<v Speaker 2>the knees shaking version.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

354
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.250
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't figure out what it meant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Bible says,</v>

355
00:21:57.251 --> 00:22:02.251
<v Speaker 2>this Babylonian leader called in all his</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorcerers and necromancers and </v>

356
00:22:02.531 --> 00:22:05.320
<v Speaker 2>astrologers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these people you know,</v>

357
00:22:05.321 --> 00:22:10.321
<v Speaker 2>the wizards that advised you know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>high Babylonian King and part of what </v>

358
00:22:10.321 --> 00:22:14.470
<v Speaker 2>makes Babylonian so fricking wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a combination of like rational,</v>

359
00:22:14.471 --> 00:22:15.400
<v Speaker 2>logical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard,</v>

360
00:22:15.401 --> 00:22:20.401
<v Speaker 2>observational science and mathematics </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all these kinds of things with </v>

361
00:22:20.401 --> 00:22:20.710
<v Speaker 2>divination.</v>

362
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:24.280
<v Speaker 2>You have to imagine a Stephen Hawking </v>
<v Speaker 2>type character,</v>

363
00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.420
<v Speaker 2>but a [inaudible] board is an integral </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of how he goes about his business.</v>

364
00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:30.490
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but none of these people,</v>

365
00:22:30.491 --> 00:22:35.491
<v Speaker 2>the Bible says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can explain to Belshazzar what the </v>

366
00:22:35.491 --> 00:22:38.191
<v Speaker 2>writing means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then someone reminds him that his </v>

367
00:22:38.191 --> 00:22:41.131
<v Speaker 2>father used this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this depor tea from Judah after the </v>

368
00:22:41.131 --> 00:22:46.081
<v Speaker 2>Babylonians had destroyed Jerusalem </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and he was here in Babylon and we </v>

369
00:22:46.081 --> 00:22:47.950
<v Speaker 2>could bring them in and see if he knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the ghostly writing means.</v>

370
00:22:47.951 --> 00:22:50.230
<v Speaker 2>And belshazzar grabbed the guy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought him in,</v>

371
00:22:50.231 --> 00:22:53.830
<v Speaker 2>and it was Daniel who was indeed a </v>
<v Speaker 2>deportee.</v>

372
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:59.250
<v Speaker 2>And Belshazzar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our gives him the same offer he gave to </v>

373
00:22:59.250 --> 00:22:59.250
<v Speaker 2>his soothsayers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

374
00:22:59.250 --> 00:22:59.360
<v Speaker 2>you tell me what this means and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

375
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:01.810
<v Speaker 2>gold chains and you'll rule a third of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kingdom.</v>

376
00:23:01.811 --> 00:23:03.280
<v Speaker 2>And all this kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Daniel says,</v>

377
00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.430
<v Speaker 2>you keep your gifts or give them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody else.</v>

378
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:11.430
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what the writing means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of different versions of </v>

379
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:11.830
<v Speaker 2>the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Torah.</v>

380
00:23:11.831 --> 00:23:15.160
<v Speaker 2>All these things in front of me and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the versions are good,</v>

381
00:23:15.161 --> 00:23:17.610
<v Speaker 2>but the King James Bible with it's you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

382
00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:21.430
<v Speaker 2>wrath of God style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no sums it up perfectly.</v>

383
00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.790
<v Speaker 2>Daniel looks at the meany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meany,</v>

384
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:29.200
<v Speaker 2>teco you Farson and describes the words </v>
<v Speaker 2>is meaning number number,</v>

385
00:23:29.201 --> 00:23:34.201
<v Speaker 2>weight divisions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then defines that as meaning this </v>

386
00:23:34.201 --> 00:23:38.200
<v Speaker 2>from the King James version quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the interpretation of the thing.</v>

387
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.260
<v Speaker 2>God has numbered thy Kingdom and </v>
<v Speaker 2>finished it.</v>

388
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Now art weighed in the balances and </v>
<v Speaker 2>found wanting thy kingdom is divided and</v>

389
00:23:46.701 --> 00:23:51.701
<v Speaker 2>given to the medes and the Persians and </v>
<v Speaker 2>quote that pretty colorful stuff,</v>

390
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.860
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in that version,</v>

391
00:23:55.190 --> 00:24:00.190
<v Speaker 2>the king of the Persians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy named Darrius conquers Babylon </v>

392
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:01.460
<v Speaker 2>that knife and kills Belshazzar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

393
00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.190
<v Speaker 2>none of that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's how the Bible story goes.</v>

394
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:10.270
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's clear from that perspective that </v>

395
00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.170
<v Speaker 2>the Persians in this story are not going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be the bad guys.</v>

396
00:24:12.171 --> 00:24:15.680
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be the instrument of </v>
<v Speaker 2>God that rectifies things.</v>

397
00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:21.820
<v Speaker 2>If God is on any one side in that story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's on the side of the medes and the </v>

398
00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:26.081
<v Speaker 2>Persians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the heck are these medes and </v>

399
00:24:26.081 --> 00:24:27.080
<v Speaker 2>Persians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if they're so good in this story,</v>

400
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:32.090
<v Speaker 2>during the time of the Babylonians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do they go from that to the evil,</v>

401
00:24:32.091 --> 00:24:33.140
<v Speaker 2>the Greek?</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

402
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two or three rulers later.</v>

403
00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's remember,</v>

404
00:24:37.011 --> 00:24:41.540
<v Speaker 2>darth vader wasn't always evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in fact,</v>

405
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:47.380
<v Speaker 2>the guy who will kick off the Persians </v>
<v Speaker 2>first real appearance on the world stage</v>

406
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:53.540
<v Speaker 2>will be a guy that is so beloved by at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least the Hebrew God.</v>

407
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:58.790
<v Speaker 2>He will be the only non Jew ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>proclaimed a messiah.</v>

408
00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:05.650
<v Speaker 2>The person who will get this honor is </v>
<v Speaker 2>known in your history books by the name </v>

409
00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:08.000
<v Speaker 2>of Cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second or cyrus the great.</v>

410
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:13.750
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted to make it sound a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit more like it probably sounded in </v>

411
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Persian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would say,</v>

412
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:17.480
<v Speaker 2>cool rush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's probably the greatest conqueror in </v>

413
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.280
<v Speaker 2>world history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Up until the time of Alexander,</v>

414
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:24.200
<v Speaker 2>he's got some of the best historical </v>
<v Speaker 2>press anybody's likely to get.</v>

415
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has a bad word to say about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

416
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:33.070
<v Speaker 2>even the Greeks like him xenophon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll write a whole book essentially </v>

417
00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:37.091
<v Speaker 2>romanticizing Cyrus's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the greatest perfect world leader in </v>

418
00:25:37.091 --> 00:25:40.301
<v Speaker 2>wind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You like to be like him and here's how </v>

419
00:25:40.301 --> 00:25:40.301
<v Speaker 2>you could emulate what he did and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda thing.</v>

420
00:25:40.301 --> 00:25:45.010
<v Speaker 2>Cyrus becomes part of a Greek motif that</v>
<v Speaker 2>western tradition will continue for a </v>

421
00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:49.811
<v Speaker 2>long time that portrays the east as </v>
<v Speaker 2>decadent and soft and corrupt,</v>

422
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:55.340
<v Speaker 2>but then how do you explain how some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these great empires got started?</v>

423
00:25:55.341 --> 00:26:00.341
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way the Greeks do it is Cyrus's </v>

424
00:26:00.341 --> 00:26:02.321
<v Speaker 2>fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he builds up this entire thing and </v>

425
00:26:02.321 --> 00:26:05.561
<v Speaker 2>bequeathed it to the Persians who </v>
<v Speaker 2>proceeded to become soft and rich and </v>

426
00:26:05.561 --> 00:26:07.400
<v Speaker 2>lazy and decadent and ruined what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>great cyrus gave them.</v>

427
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.980
<v Speaker 2>So even the Greeks portray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cyrus has this great figure,</v>

428
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:15.580
<v Speaker 2>and yet we know so little about the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you contrast what we know about him </v>

429
00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:18.080
<v Speaker 2>and the guy who probably takes the crown</v>
<v Speaker 2>from him,</v>

430
00:26:18.081 --> 00:26:20.450
<v Speaker 2>his greatest conqueror in the world up </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that point,</v>

431
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.790
<v Speaker 2>Alexander the Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's night and day.</v>

432
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Alexander the great exists in a fully </v>
<v Speaker 2>colorized historical world.</v>

433
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.440
<v Speaker 2>A post hirata tests world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a world where Alexander will bring his </v>

434
00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.341
<v Speaker 2>own publicists with him from place to </v>
<v Speaker 2>place so they can record his latest </v>

435
00:26:36.471 --> 00:26:40.130
<v Speaker 2>deeds and sayings and doings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cyrus the great founds,</v>

436
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:44.130
<v Speaker 2>the last great empire and maybe what </v>
<v Speaker 2>could call the black</v>

437
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:49.130
<v Speaker 5>and white era in the Near East,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an era where we know the majority of the</v>

438
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:55.790
<v Speaker 5>people back then because of things like </v>
<v Speaker 5>monoliths and statues and reliefs and </v>

439
00:26:56.311 --> 00:27:00.630
<v Speaker 5>carvings and tune paintings and </v>
<v Speaker 5>architecture and ruins.</v>

440
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.800
<v Speaker 5>When you do have writing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get business records and </v>

441
00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.471
<v Speaker 5>proclamations and transactions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of the best stuff you get from this</v>

442
00:27:09.811 --> 00:27:14.811
<v Speaker 5>era are the correspondence is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>letters between diplomats and governors </v>

443
00:27:14.811 --> 00:27:19.041
<v Speaker 5>and rulers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what none of those people are doing </v>

444
00:27:19.041 --> 00:27:20.910
<v Speaker 5>is writing to amuse or entertain </v>
<v Speaker 5>anybody.</v>

445
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:25.970
<v Speaker 5>All of the writing from the black and </v>
<v Speaker 5>white period of human history is colder.</v>

446
00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:31.140
<v Speaker 5>They all have a purpose beyond being </v>
<v Speaker 5>entertaining.</v>

447
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.740
<v Speaker 5>It might be a religious purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 5>business purpose at governmental purpose</v>

448
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:40.040
<v Speaker 5>or even two important officials writing </v>
<v Speaker 5>each other about in a matters of state </v>

449
00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.241
<v Speaker 5>and a few personal things creep in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's very different than writing </v>

450
00:27:44.241 --> 00:27:47.571
<v Speaker 5>something to be performed in front of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>live audience for their entertainment </v>

451
00:27:47.571 --> 00:27:47.790
<v Speaker 5>and enjoyment.</v>

452
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:54.770
<v Speaker 5>I read something historian Michael Grant</v>
<v Speaker 5>had written about Hurghada tests </v>

453
00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:58.340
<v Speaker 5>suggesting that the reason hirata test </v>
<v Speaker 5>has the interesting structure that he </v>

454
00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.911
<v Speaker 5>does to his histories is because it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>not meant to be read as much as it was </v>

455
00:28:01.911 --> 00:28:02.370
<v Speaker 5>meant to be performed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Live,</v>

456
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:07.530
<v Speaker 5>ran allowed by Hirata test himself and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the digressions and the tangents in</v>

457
00:28:07.531 --> 00:28:12.531
<v Speaker 5>the work represent things that would </v>
<v Speaker 5>have worked much better in a live </v>

458
00:28:12.531 --> 00:28:13.560
<v Speaker 5>situation with somebody broadcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you will,</v>

459
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:18.720
<v Speaker 5>an oratory as opposed to you somebody </v>
<v Speaker 5>writing something to be read by somebody</v>

460
00:28:18.721 --> 00:28:23.721
<v Speaker 5>else remotely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If that's the case and you don't really </v>

461
00:28:23.721 --> 00:28:27.921
<v Speaker 5>have the first written prose history </v>
<v Speaker 5>with Hurghada tissue of the script for </v>

462
00:28:27.921 --> 00:28:28.860
<v Speaker 5>Hurghada does his live show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you will,</v>

463
00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:34.370
<v Speaker 5>which would explain a lot considering </v>
<v Speaker 5>that if you want to get drama and color </v>

464
00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.851
<v Speaker 5>and stories before the period of Herat </v>
<v Speaker 5>at is you're looking at things like the </v>

465
00:28:37.851 --> 00:28:41.790
<v Speaker 5>Iliad by homer or the epic of Gilgamesh </v>
<v Speaker 5>from Mesopotamian history.</v>

466
00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:46.790
<v Speaker 5>Both of which are believed by the way to</v>
<v Speaker 5>have been stories told for hundreds of </v>

467
00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.180
<v Speaker 5>years that we're finally compiled and </v>
<v Speaker 5>written down.</v>

468
00:28:48.181 --> 00:28:52.570
<v Speaker 5>Same thing with like a beowulf in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Scandinavian history may be Hurghada.</v>

469
00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:57.180
<v Speaker 5>This is more like the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 5>storytellers than first meets the eye to</v>

470
00:28:57.181 --> 00:29:00.240
<v Speaker 5>give him some credit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Heraclitus was trying to be a chronicler</v>

471
00:29:00.241 --> 00:29:05.241
<v Speaker 5>at the same time that he was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do the same thing I was told to do in </v>

472
00:29:05.241 --> 00:29:07.981
<v Speaker 5>news reporting to relate the facts as </v>
<v Speaker 5>best as he understood them in the most </v>

473
00:29:07.981 --> 00:29:12.171
<v Speaker 5>compelling way he could.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what you have here in this ancient </v>

474
00:29:12.481 --> 00:29:15.570
<v Speaker 5>story is not so much myth that wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>be fair,</v>

475
00:29:15.571 --> 00:29:18.480
<v Speaker 5>not just to people like Hurghada.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Despite all of the great historians over</v>

476
00:29:18.481 --> 00:29:22.590
<v Speaker 5>time who have found all these records </v>
<v Speaker 5>and put together like a jigsaw puzzle,</v>

477
00:29:22.591 --> 00:29:27.591
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a viewing of the past that is always </v>

478
00:29:27.591 --> 00:29:30.501
<v Speaker 5>being redone and improved,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but wouldn't have even existed there if </v>

479
00:29:30.501 --> 00:29:31.230
<v Speaker 5>a ton of different pieces of the puzzle </v>
<v Speaker 5>hadn't been brought together.</v>

480
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.840
<v Speaker 5>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>while it's not myth,</v>

481
00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:35.760
<v Speaker 5>not exactly true either.</v>

482
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:41.590
<v Speaker 5>There are historians who've spent their </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole lives trying to separate the truth</v>

483
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:46.620
<v Speaker 5>from the fiction in works like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Heraclitus actually laughed out loud </v>

484
00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:50.881
<v Speaker 5>when I read [inaudible] book from Cyrus </v>
<v Speaker 5>to Alexander Brown is one of the great </v>

485
00:29:50.881 --> 00:29:54.610
<v Speaker 5>historians of Ancient Persia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this book is like the encyclopedia.</v>

486
00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:56.110
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very detailed,</v>

487
00:29:56.111 --> 00:29:58.420
<v Speaker 5>very specific.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's 1200 pages.</v>

488
00:29:58.421 --> 00:30:03.421
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an enormous comprehensive book and </v>

489
00:30:03.421 --> 00:30:06.901
<v Speaker 5>the very first lines in it are as part </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the opening page where he quotes an </v>

490
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:09.010
<v Speaker 5>artist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

491
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.100
<v Speaker 5>who says quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and even if it is not true,</v>

492
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:15.790
<v Speaker 5>you need to believe in ancient history </v>
<v Speaker 5>and quote,</v>

493
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:21.750
<v Speaker 5>does anything better set up the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dichotomy here and how wonderful that in</v>

494
00:30:22.001 --> 00:30:25.930
<v Speaker 5>a 1200 page book that is exhaustive as </v>
<v Speaker 5>all get out,</v>

495
00:30:25.931 --> 00:30:28.660
<v Speaker 5>the very first line from the historian </v>
<v Speaker 5>is yeah,</v>

496
00:30:28.661 --> 00:30:30.490
<v Speaker 5>it might not be true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you have to believe it anyway.</v>

497
00:30:30.491 --> 00:30:30.840
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

498
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:31.630
<v Speaker 5>it's wonderful.</v>

499
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:36.630
<v Speaker 5>And it sums up the problem with ancient </v>
<v Speaker 5>history and that is that you have the </v>

500
00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:37.570
<v Speaker 5>feeling that most of what you're reading</v>
<v Speaker 5>here is the truth.</v>

501
00:30:37.571 --> 00:30:42.571
<v Speaker 5>And these events did happen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a lot of fiction mixed in </v>

502
00:30:42.571 --> 00:30:45.901
<v Speaker 5>and it's difficult to know what's what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's difficult to separate one from </v>

503
00:30:45.901 --> 00:30:49.621
<v Speaker 5>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's also difficult to know where to </v>

504
00:30:49.621 --> 00:30:52.771
<v Speaker 5>begin the story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a classic problem anybody has </v>

505
00:30:52.771 --> 00:30:52.771
<v Speaker 5>trying to explain something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

506
00:30:52.771 --> 00:30:54.040
<v Speaker 5>How do you begin a story of Cyrus the </v>
<v Speaker 5>second and the Persians?</v>

507
00:30:54.041 --> 00:30:57.610
<v Speaker 5>When does that start?</v>
<v Speaker 5>All histories connected as we know,</v>

508
00:30:57.611 --> 00:31:02.611
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all a bunch of tumbling dominoes </v>

509
00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:04.510
<v Speaker 5>and one event and series of events leads</v>
<v Speaker 5>up to other ones and sets it all up.</v>

510
00:31:04.511 --> 00:31:08.320
<v Speaker 5>Where's the logical starting point?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm terrible at this by the way.</v>

511
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:13.710
<v Speaker 5>I did a whole series on the decline and </v>
<v Speaker 5>fall of the Roman republic hours and </v>

512
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:17.010
<v Speaker 5>hours and hours because I was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>find the logical place to start a story </v>

513
00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:19.711
<v Speaker 5>about Cleopatra never even got </v>
<v Speaker 5>practically to Cleopatra was all </v>

514
00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:24.300
<v Speaker 5>dominoes before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then Iran test starts with the earliest </v>

515
00:31:25.521 --> 00:31:27.320
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He knows about it and it's a miracle.</v>

516
00:31:27.321 --> 00:31:32.321
<v Speaker 5>He knows about it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He begins by talking about the </v>

517
00:31:32.321 --> 00:31:32.321
<v Speaker 5>Assyrians.</v>

518
00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.950
<v Speaker 5>He also talks about having multiple </v>
<v Speaker 5>versions of this story,</v>

519
00:31:35.951 --> 00:31:38.290
<v Speaker 5>so Hurghada is being harassed at this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

520
00:31:38.291 --> 00:31:39.880
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've heard a lot of different things.</v>

521
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:42.790
<v Speaker 5>Here are my sources.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The story begins,</v>

522
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:44.350
<v Speaker 5>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and here's what he writes.</v>

523
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:50.190
<v Speaker 5>Quote from here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our story demands that we inquire </v>

524
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:53.641
<v Speaker 5>further about Cyrus and the Persians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was this man who destroyed the </v>

525
00:31:53.641 --> 00:31:56.530
<v Speaker 5>empire of creases and how did the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Persians become the leaders of Asia?</v>

526
00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:01.830
<v Speaker 5>I shall write this account using as my </v>
<v Speaker 5>sources certain Persians who do not </v>

527
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:05.080
<v Speaker 5>intend to magnify the deeds of Cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but rather to tell what really happened.</v>

528
00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:10.230
<v Speaker 5>Although I know of three other ways in </v>
<v Speaker 5>which the story of Cyrus is told and </v>

529
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:14.330
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then he begins the story using a </v>

530
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:16.771
<v Speaker 5>phrase that should probably be proceeded</v>
<v Speaker 5>by a line like once upon a time quote.</v>

531
00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:23.550
<v Speaker 5>The Assyrians ruled inland Asia for 520 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years and the needs were the first to </v>

532
00:32:24.371 --> 00:32:25.390
<v Speaker 5>revolt from them.</v>

533
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.750
<v Speaker 5>It would seem that they proved </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves to be truly courageous men by</v>

534
00:32:28.751 --> 00:32:33.751
<v Speaker 5>fighting the Assyrians for the cause of </v>
<v Speaker 5>freedom and they succeeded in casting </v>

535
00:32:33.751 --> 00:32:35.440
<v Speaker 5>off slavery and we're liberated </v>
<v Speaker 5>afterwards.</v>

536
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 5>The other ethnic groups freed themselves</v>
<v Speaker 5>as the medes had done and quote,</v>

537
00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.430
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the medes need a little explaining,</v>

538
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:48.970
<v Speaker 5>just like at the biblical story of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Belshazzar is feast when he said that </v>

539
00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:50.180
<v Speaker 5>the empire is going to be divided </v>
<v Speaker 5>between the medes and the Persians.</v>

540
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.180
<v Speaker 5>The medes and the Persians are a related</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

541
00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.820
<v Speaker 5>The Greeks used the terms </v>
<v Speaker 5>interchangeably.</v>

542
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:57.000
<v Speaker 5>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

543
00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.350
<v Speaker 5>practically like brothers in the eyes of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Greeks when I was growing up,</v>

544
00:33:00.351 --> 00:33:05.351
<v Speaker 5>they were just starting to change from </v>
<v Speaker 5>the brothers sort of interpretation and </v>

545
00:33:05.351 --> 00:33:05.351
<v Speaker 5>may be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

546
00:33:05.351 --> 00:33:09.620
<v Speaker 5>maybe they were more like first cousins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of the more recent histories I've </v>

547
00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:13.691
<v Speaker 5>been reading.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you could say we downgrade the </v>

548
00:33:13.691 --> 00:33:15.761
<v Speaker 5>relationship even a step further to </v>
<v Speaker 5>something like second cousins who </v>

549
00:33:15.761 --> 00:33:15.761
<v Speaker 5>fought.</v>

550
00:33:15.761 --> 00:33:19.570
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes historians differ on when </v>
<v Speaker 5>these related people's arrived in the </v>

551
00:33:20.961 --> 00:33:23.990
<v Speaker 5>area where they can now play a role in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the history of this,</v>

552
00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:27.040
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>enclosed sort of geopolitical world with</v>

553
00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.330
<v Speaker 5>Egypt and Babylon in the Syria and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these places.</v>

554
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:35.110
<v Speaker 5>There's even a few historians who think </v>
<v Speaker 5>they may have always been there and you </v>

555
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.720
<v Speaker 5>just didn't hear about them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nevertheless,</v>

556
00:33:35.721 --> 00:33:40.640
<v Speaker 5>the world upon which they have intruded </v>
<v Speaker 5>is so old.</v>

557
00:33:40.641 --> 00:33:44.420
<v Speaker 5>It's hard for modern people to get our </v>
<v Speaker 5>minds around because it's hard for us to</v>

558
00:33:44.421 --> 00:33:46.760
<v Speaker 5>imagine something 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago.</v>

559
00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.890
<v Speaker 5>You know when thermopylae is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

560
00:33:48.891 --> 00:33:53.180
<v Speaker 5>imagine something from 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 5>years before that.</v>

561
00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:57.320
<v Speaker 5>That's how old this world is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love the way in the 19 forties,</v>

562
00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:02.740
<v Speaker 5>historian 80 olmsted tried to give the </v>
<v Speaker 5>reader a sense of how old this world was</v>

563
00:34:03.351 --> 00:34:06.380
<v Speaker 5>and how the people who lived in it new </v>
<v Speaker 5>it was old.</v>

564
00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:10.730
<v Speaker 5>He starts by talking about Cyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The second are Cyrus,</v>

565
00:34:10.731 --> 00:34:12.890
<v Speaker 5>the great person after he takes over </v>
<v Speaker 5>Babylon,</v>

566
00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.550
<v Speaker 5>trying to describe how old the world is </v>
<v Speaker 5>that Babylon represents,</v>

567
00:34:16.551 --> 00:34:17.270
<v Speaker 5>and he says,</v>

570
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:29.770
<v Speaker 5>The world knew its antiquity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It scholars had compiled long dynastic </v>

571
00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:34.451
<v Speaker 5>lists and simple addition appeared to </v>

00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:01.730
<v Speaker 5>The Babylonians placed 10 kings,</v>

<v Speaker 5>who reigned in predelivery in times,</v>

583

<v Speaker 5>those of Babylon or Egypt.</v>

<v Speaker 5>They recorded that one.</v>

588
00:35:30.921 --> 00:35:35.921

<v Speaker 5>Greek poets chanted a legendary history </v>

589
00:35:35.921 --> 00:35:40.900
<v Speaker 5>which was counted backwards to the time </v>

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:58.250

<v Speaker 5>600 and 700 bce,</v>

594
00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:03.640
<v Speaker 5>there were quite a few rulers in quite a</v>
<v Speaker 5>few of these old countries that became </v>

595
00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:07.121
<v Speaker 5>archeological buffs where they would go </v>
<v Speaker 5>back and pay for the excavation of </v>

596
00:36:07.121 --> 00:36:11.501
<v Speaker 5>earlier rulers that ruled a thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>1500 years before them and in Egypt may </v>

597
00:36:12.771 --> 00:36:17.771
<v Speaker 5>have dressed similarly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the continuity of the Egyptian </v>

598
00:36:17.771 --> 00:36:17.840
<v Speaker 5>fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

599
00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:23.860
<v Speaker 5>my favorite story that really gives you </v>
<v Speaker 5>an idea of the antiquity of things and </v>

600
00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:24.950
<v Speaker 5>how the peoples of this region </v>
<v Speaker 5>understood it,</v>

601
00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:28.130
<v Speaker 5>knew it in a way that you don't normally</v>
<v Speaker 5>think about,</v>

602
00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:33.580
<v Speaker 5>has to do with an archeological </v>
<v Speaker 5>excavation that happened in the late 18 </v>

603
00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:37.001
<v Speaker 5>hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>early 19 hundreds in modern day Iran in </v>

604
00:36:37.001 --> 00:36:38.900
<v Speaker 5>a city through much of the historical </v>
<v Speaker 5>period that was called Sousa.</v>

605
00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:42.620
<v Speaker 5>Sousa is a very old city,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ancient city.</v>

606
00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.020
<v Speaker 5>It will be important in the Persian </v>
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>

607
00:36:45.021 --> 00:36:50.021
<v Speaker 5>It will be important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>After that period for a very long time </v>

608
00:36:50.021 --> 00:36:53.121
<v Speaker 5>of people called the elamites resided in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sousa and he was in a strata were the </v>

609
00:36:55.490 --> 00:37:00.490
<v Speaker 5>Eland Mike period,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was that these archeologists began to </v>

610
00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:02.981
<v Speaker 5>uncover some of the greatest treasures </v>
<v Speaker 5>and antiquities in near eastern history </v>

611
00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:06.380
<v Speaker 5>and they didn't belong there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They found,</v>

612
00:37:06.381 --> 00:37:11.381
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the famous steel or steely take your </v>

613
00:37:11.381 --> 00:37:13.880
<v Speaker 5>pick of Hammurabi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something that is huge.</v>

614
00:37:13.881 --> 00:37:16.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's a giant seven foot tall or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something heavy,</v>

615
00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:20.300
<v Speaker 5>big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they find it there.</v>

616
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.750
<v Speaker 5>What's it doing there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That should be in Babylon.</v>

617
00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.080
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you think this deal of Hama Hammurabi</v>

618
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:33.140
<v Speaker 5>is old circus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>17 hundreds bc or something like that,</v>

619
00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:38.520
<v Speaker 5>archaeologists then find something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a good deal older than that.</v>

620
00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:44.120
<v Speaker 5>It's called the victory steel of sin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was an Acadian King from the 22 </v>

621
00:37:45.061 --> 00:37:46.800
<v Speaker 5>hundreds BC.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

622
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.720
<v Speaker 5>so by the time they were making the </v>
<v Speaker 5>steel of Hammurabi,</v>

623
00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:54.840
<v Speaker 5>the victory steel of Naropa sin was half</v>
<v Speaker 5>a millennia old.</v>

624
00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:59.490
<v Speaker 5>There were other antiquities that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>found to all of them from elsewhere.</v>

625
00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.960
<v Speaker 5>They were the spoils,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the loot,</v>

626
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:09.670
<v Speaker 5>the stuff that the Ila Mites took back </v>
<v Speaker 5>with them when they sacked Babylon,</v>

627
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:15.320
<v Speaker 5>and in fact you could tell because </v>
<v Speaker 5>somehow all this stuff was on display </v>

628
00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:21.180
<v Speaker 5>and below the original inscriptions in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the original language explaining what </v>

629
00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.731
<v Speaker 5>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was an eland might inscription </v>

630
00:38:25.731 --> 00:38:28.821
<v Speaker 5>explaining when it was taken from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Babylonians as loot and spoils and as a </v>

631
00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:32.700
<v Speaker 5>piece of memorabilia commemorating a </v>
<v Speaker 5>great victory.</v>

632
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.960
<v Speaker 5>I keep imagining a bunch of trophies in </v>
<v Speaker 5>like a college or university or school </v>

633
00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.330
<v Speaker 5>trophy case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

634
00:38:40.331 --> 00:38:44.980
<v Speaker 5>commemorating the victories over the </v>
<v Speaker 5>arrows over your school rivals the oaken</v>

635
00:38:44.981 --> 00:38:46.750
<v Speaker 5>bucket,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Apple Cup,</v>

636
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.990
<v Speaker 5>the steel of Hama,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Robbie,</v>

637
00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:50.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that Kinda thing.</v>

638
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:53.110
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't just,</v>

639
00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:58.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cultural artifacts that were taken in </v>

640
00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.690
<v Speaker 5>the famous elamite might invasion that </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened in the 11 hundreds.</v>

641
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.290
<v Speaker 5>They took the god of Babylon with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They took,</v>

642
00:39:02.291 --> 00:39:07.291
<v Speaker 5>Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>took with them the statue that </v>

643
00:39:07.291 --> 00:39:09.421
<v Speaker 5>represented the God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is one of my favorite things </v>

644
00:39:09.421 --> 00:39:12.691
<v Speaker 5>about ancient history is this idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes that these statues that </v>

645
00:39:12.691 --> 00:39:14.290
<v Speaker 5>represented the gods were somehow </v>
<v Speaker 5>connected to the god,</v>

646
00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:17.380
<v Speaker 5>him or herself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes were,</v>

647
00:39:17.381 --> 00:39:19.660
<v Speaker 5>I mean there were some beliefs that they</v>
<v Speaker 5>were the gods,</v>

648
00:39:19.661 --> 00:39:20.770
<v Speaker 5>and so you'll see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

649
00:39:20.771 --> 00:39:23.590
<v Speaker 5>the Assyrians in a lot of their stone </v>
<v Speaker 5>reliefs,</v>

650
00:39:23.591 --> 00:39:26.290
<v Speaker 5>when they're showing the conquest of </v>
<v Speaker 5>some civilization or city,</v>

651
00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:31.650
<v Speaker 5>they've got the God that their soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 5>are carrying away along with all of the </v>

652
00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:31.650
<v Speaker 5>loot.</v>

653
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.480
<v Speaker 5>And it's kind of symbolic when you think</v>
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

654
00:39:34.481 --> 00:39:36.850
<v Speaker 5>It's a sign our God is stronger than </v>
<v Speaker 5>your God.</v>

655
00:39:36.851 --> 00:39:38.860
<v Speaker 5>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've got your God.</v>

656
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:41.650
<v Speaker 5>And in a lot of these near eastern </v>
<v Speaker 5>civilizations,</v>

657
00:39:41.651 --> 00:39:46.651
<v Speaker 5>the historians wrote that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>reestablish some of these cities until </v>

658
00:39:46.651 --> 00:39:47.650
<v Speaker 5>the god is returned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in other words,</v>

659
00:39:47.651 --> 00:39:50.140
<v Speaker 5>when Babylon gets sacked and the god is </v>
<v Speaker 5>taken away,</v>

660
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:54.040
<v Speaker 5>they can't do a big rebuilding thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>until the God has brought back.</v>

661
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:56.280
<v Speaker 5>We got your God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

662
00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:59.830
<v Speaker 5>talk about rubbing your nose in a defeat</v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

663
00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:05.730
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to think about what the </v>

664
00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:07.141
<v Speaker 5>equivalent would be in the modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Certainly if somebody took over the </v>

665
00:40:07.141 --> 00:40:07.630
<v Speaker 5>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if the elamites had done it,</v>

666
00:40:07.631 --> 00:40:12.631
<v Speaker 5>they would have the statue of Liberty in</v>
<v Speaker 5>their little museum there with a little </v>

667
00:40:12.631 --> 00:40:15.850
<v Speaker 5>notation underneath taken from New York </v>
<v Speaker 5>City after we crushed the Americans.</v>

668
00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:19.780
<v Speaker 5>I love the elamites and would love to </v>
<v Speaker 5>know more about them.</v>

669
00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.580
<v Speaker 5>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of those peoples that just not a lot</v>

670
00:40:21.581 --> 00:40:26.581
<v Speaker 5>is known.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What you can say for sure is that they </v>

671
00:40:26.581 --> 00:40:29.821
<v Speaker 5>are the great long standing urban power </v>
<v Speaker 5>in what's now modern day or ron for </v>

672
00:40:30.821 --> 00:40:34.660
<v Speaker 5>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The big contemporaries and the big power</v>

673
00:40:34.661 --> 00:40:39.661
<v Speaker 5>from that region that rival the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Babylon's and the Assyrians in the </v>

674
00:40:39.661 --> 00:40:43.231
<v Speaker 5>Egypt's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's usually a power in the north to </v>

675
00:40:43.231 --> 00:40:43.231
<v Speaker 5>north of Assyria,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that changes.</v>

676
00:40:43.231 --> 00:40:45.490
<v Speaker 5>It could be Matatani,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could be the hittites.</v>

677
00:40:45.491 --> 00:40:46.630
<v Speaker 5>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are to.</v>

678
00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:52.050
<v Speaker 5>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a relatively stable geo </v>

679
00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:52.900
<v Speaker 5>political balance going on for a long </v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

680
00:40:52.901 --> 00:40:57.901
<v Speaker 5>even through the ups and downs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then that world begins to be </v>

681
00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:03.630
<v Speaker 5>consciously destroyed and that opens up </v>
<v Speaker 5>the door to an instability where you </v>

682
00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:10.630
<v Speaker 5>know anything can happen and shocking </v>
<v Speaker 5>things did.</v>

683
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:16.620
<v Speaker 5>It starts with the absolute skyrocketing</v>
<v Speaker 5>by historical standards of the military,</v>

684
00:41:19.901 --> 00:41:21.700
<v Speaker 5>dominance of the Assyrians.</v>

685
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:27.780
<v Speaker 5>Now you may be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were just talking about the needs a </v>

686
00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.221
<v Speaker 5>minute ago and now we've shifted over to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Assyrians and what does one have to </v>

687
00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:33.211
<v Speaker 5>do with the other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's their paths crossing that sort </v>

688
00:41:33.211 --> 00:41:37.280
<v Speaker 5>of up the stage for the next period.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In western Asian history,</v>

689
00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.210
<v Speaker 5>the medes will turn out to be one of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>couple of David's in this story,</v>

690
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:46.211
<v Speaker 5>who will take down Goliath in order to </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand what a big deal that is.</v>

691
00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.990
<v Speaker 5>You need to understand how big of a deal</v>
<v Speaker 5>Goliath was in this story.</v>

692
00:41:50.991 --> 00:41:55.991
<v Speaker 5>The Assyrians are Goliath and they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>transformed in the 700 bce from one of </v>

693
00:41:57.711 --> 00:42:02.711
<v Speaker 5>the great power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes the greatest of the great </v>

694
00:42:02.711 --> 00:42:04.901
<v Speaker 5>power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes not into the regional </v>

695
00:42:04.901 --> 00:42:08.141
<v Speaker 5>superpower,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and as far as these people were </v>

696
00:42:08.141 --> 00:42:08.300
<v Speaker 5>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the region was the entire world</v>

697
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:14.650
<v Speaker 5>and this quickly growing absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 5>devastating new empire in terms of its </v>

698
00:42:15.921 --> 00:42:20.921
<v Speaker 5>military abilities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would have been the ones fighting the </v>

699
00:42:20.921 --> 00:42:24.491
<v Speaker 5>Greeks and the spartans at their mop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ali had the medes and their allies not </v>

700
00:42:25.821 --> 00:42:28.370
<v Speaker 5>been able to take down this Goliath,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I got news for you.</v>

701
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't think the neo was Syrian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Armies at their height would have beaten</v>

702
00:42:33.801 --> 00:42:36.710
<v Speaker 5>Alexander the great and his Macedonians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure,</v>

703
00:42:36.711 --> 00:42:41.711
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think they crush the ancient </v>

704
00:42:41.711 --> 00:42:45.491
<v Speaker 5>Greeks of Athens and Sparta,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so maybe if the past that they're </v>

705
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:50.630
<v Speaker 5>happily in the Greco.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Persian wars really was a war for </v>

706
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:53.381
<v Speaker 5>Western civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We should be thankful that there were </v>

707
00:42:53.381 --> 00:42:56.651
<v Speaker 5>people like the needs to take down the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who I think would have been the </v>

708
00:42:56.651 --> 00:43:00.890
<v Speaker 5>odds on favorite in any vegas betting </v>
<v Speaker 5>pool to take down the ancient Greeks and</v>

709
00:43:00.891 --> 00:43:02.290
<v Speaker 5>for ADBC,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he.</v>

710
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:05.990
<v Speaker 5>They weren't around in for ADBC in part </v>
<v Speaker 5>because of these people.</v>

711
00:43:05.991 --> 00:43:10.991
<v Speaker 5>The medes who in the seven hundreds when</v>
<v Speaker 5>the story really heats up and get </v>

712
00:43:10.991 --> 00:43:14.871
<v Speaker 5>strange or a people on the periphery of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the known universe at the time to the </v>

713
00:43:16.221 --> 00:43:21.221
<v Speaker 5>Assyrians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The medes are sort of the eastern edge </v>

714
00:43:21.221 --> 00:43:24.971
<v Speaker 5>of the known galaxy and beyond those </v>
<v Speaker 5>muddy and tribes with all their petty </v>

715
00:43:24.971 --> 00:43:28.550
<v Speaker 5>little kinglets are groups of half </v>
<v Speaker 5>human,</v>

716
00:43:28.551 --> 00:43:33.551
<v Speaker 5>half monsters called the Lumen Monda in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Syrian animals,</v>

717
00:43:33.711 --> 00:43:38.711
<v Speaker 5>the Human Monda by the way in old </v>
<v Speaker 5>acadian term that means the horde from </v>

718
00:43:38.841 --> 00:43:43.841
<v Speaker 5>who knows where and it's believed that </v>
<v Speaker 5>this refers to the nomadic peoples of </v>

719
00:43:45.861 --> 00:43:50.861
<v Speaker 5>the step,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cultural forebears of the hands and </v>

720
00:43:50.861 --> 00:43:52.280
<v Speaker 5>the Turks and the Hmong goals and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>those people.</v>

721
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:56.300
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the medes and the Persians were supposed</v>

722
00:43:56.301 --> 00:44:01.301
<v Speaker 5>to be able to speak to the Human Monda </v>
<v Speaker 5>without the use of translators.</v>

723
00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:07.370
<v Speaker 5>How'd you like to be related enough to a</v>
<v Speaker 5>people known as the horde from who knows</v>

724
00:44:07.881 --> 00:44:12.080
<v Speaker 5>where to be able to understand their </v>
<v Speaker 5>language without anybody helping.</v>

725
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:16.970
<v Speaker 5>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's in this period right around 7:50</v>

726
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:22.190
<v Speaker 5>bce where you get a sort of an unusual </v>
<v Speaker 5>happening in ancient history where a lot</v>

727
00:44:22.611 --> 00:44:27.611
<v Speaker 5>seems to happen in a relatively short </v>
<v Speaker 5>period of time because in ancient </v>

728
00:44:27.611 --> 00:44:32.351
<v Speaker 5>history you get these long stretches </v>
<v Speaker 5>where it seems like very little changes </v>

729
00:44:32.351 --> 00:44:32.710
<v Speaker 5>in 7:45</v>
<v Speaker 5>BC.</v>

730
00:44:32.711 --> 00:44:35.670
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the arrival of a new Assyrian King,</v>

731
00:44:35.671 --> 00:44:38.100
<v Speaker 5>a guy named Tim [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>the third,</v>

732
00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:39.540
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Syria,</v>

733
00:44:39.541 --> 00:44:44.541
<v Speaker 5>begins to go on this sprint,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe you could call it a historical </v>

734
00:44:44.541 --> 00:44:47.250
<v Speaker 5>sprint that will last until about six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15,</v>

735
00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:48.810
<v Speaker 5>six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>12 bcee,</v>

736
00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:54.740
<v Speaker 5>and we'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe you could say the last burst of </v>

737
00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:58.221
<v Speaker 5>rocket fuel of that historical era of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that ancient world about to give way to </v>

738
00:44:59.071 --> 00:45:03.150
<v Speaker 5>the era of the Greeks and classical </v>
<v Speaker 5>antiquity and all that kind of stuff and</v>

739
00:45:03.151 --> 00:45:05.700
<v Speaker 5>rockets it to the heights where the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Assyrian army,</v>

740
00:45:05.701 --> 00:45:09.230
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in say 700 BC,</v>

741
00:45:09.231 --> 00:45:12.870
<v Speaker 5>he or the equivalent of like the Roman </v>
<v Speaker 5>empire,</v>

742
00:45:12.871 --> 00:45:15.480
<v Speaker 5>his armies at their height for their </v>
<v Speaker 5>era.</v>

743
00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:21.590
<v Speaker 5>The Assyrians will systematically smash </v>
<v Speaker 5>the other great powers in that area and </v>

744
00:45:23.551 --> 00:45:25.740
<v Speaker 5>it's difficult by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're powerful.</v>

745
00:45:25.741 --> 00:45:27.840
<v Speaker 5>They're sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have a lot of money.</v>

746
00:45:27.841 --> 00:45:32.841
<v Speaker 5>Some of these places,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Assyrians often have to face not </v>

747
00:45:32.841 --> 00:45:35.460
<v Speaker 5>single states,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but coalitions of states,</v>

748
00:45:35.461 --> 00:45:39.990
<v Speaker 5>big allies that allied simply to deal </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the Assyrians and they lose most of</v>

749
00:45:39.991 --> 00:45:40.980
<v Speaker 5>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyway.</v>

750
00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.070
<v Speaker 5>I'll try not to geek out on the army too</v>
<v Speaker 5>much,</v>

751
00:45:44.071 --> 00:45:49.071
<v Speaker 5>but it's the gold standard for the era.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Richard Gabriel and Karen mets in their </v>

752
00:45:49.071 --> 00:45:53.100
<v Speaker 5>book from sewer to Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so to describe it in a nutshell in terms</v>

753
00:45:53.101 --> 00:45:58.101
<v Speaker 5>of just giving you a mental picture of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the capabilities of an army from this </v>

754
00:45:58.101 --> 00:45:59.640
<v Speaker 5>era,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the so called Biblical era when</v>

755
00:45:59.641 --> 00:46:04.641
<v Speaker 5>I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they right quote the Assyrian Army of </v>

756
00:46:04.641 --> 00:46:07.710
<v Speaker 5>the eighth century BC.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was comprised of at least 150,000</v>

757
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:12.750
<v Speaker 5>to 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>men and was the largest standing </v>

758
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:13.560
<v Speaker 5>military force that the Middle East had </v>
<v Speaker 5>witnessed to this time,</v>

759
00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:18.060
<v Speaker 5>and a Syrian combat field army numbered </v>
<v Speaker 5>approximately 50,000</v>

760
00:46:18.061 --> 00:46:23.061
<v Speaker 5>men with various mixes of infantry </v>
<v Speaker 5>chariots in cavalry in modern times the </v>

761
00:46:23.061 --> 00:46:24.360
<v Speaker 5>size of an Assyrian field.</v>

762
00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:29.360
<v Speaker 5>Army was equal to five modern heavy </v>
<v Speaker 5>American divisions are almost eight </v>

763
00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.280
<v Speaker 5>Soviet field divisions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When it rained for battle,</v>

764
00:46:32.281 --> 00:46:37.281
<v Speaker 5>the army took up an area of 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 5>yards across and a hundred yards deep.</v>

765
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:42.590
<v Speaker 5>The Assyrian army was also the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>army to be entirely equipped with iron </v>

766
00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:44.070
<v Speaker 5>weapons and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boy,</v>

767
00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:46.500
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't that Soviet reference date </v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

768
00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:49.710
<v Speaker 5>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get an idea that we're talking about</v>

769
00:46:49.711 --> 00:46:54.711
<v Speaker 5>armies that were exponentially larger </v>
<v Speaker 5>than in the recent past in the bronze </v>

770
00:46:56.011 --> 00:46:56.610
<v Speaker 5>age,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

771
00:46:56.611 --> 00:47:01.611
<v Speaker 5>narrow sin was putting like 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>guys into the field and thinking he had </v>

772
00:47:01.611 --> 00:47:04.200
<v Speaker 5>a lot of men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Assyrians have multiple divisions of</v>

773
00:47:04.201 --> 00:47:05.430
<v Speaker 5>50,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>each.</v>

774
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:10.180
<v Speaker 5>They will smash the power of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mountain state of you.</v>

775
00:47:10.181 --> 00:47:12.300
<v Speaker 5>Rawr too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At one point during this period,</v>

776
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:17.330
<v Speaker 5>that's where modern Armenia is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They will several times have to deal </v>

777
00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:20.880
<v Speaker 5>with Babylon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Another one of their great kings,</v>

778
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.990
<v Speaker 5>Senaca rib takes care of that and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>they just have to do it again and again.</v>

779
00:47:24.990 --> 00:47:29.990
<v Speaker 5>Babylon is the thorn in the side </v>
<v Speaker 5>perpetually of the Syria and the </v>

780
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:33.990
<v Speaker 5>elamites always get in trouble with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Assyrians because they always support </v>

781
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.781
<v Speaker 5>the Babylonians because after all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of them would like to see the </v>

782
00:47:36.781 --> 00:47:40.021
<v Speaker 5>Assyrians cut down to size.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eventually the Assyrians will cut the </v>

783
00:47:40.021 --> 00:47:44.911
<v Speaker 5>elamites down to size to one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 5>horrifying of all the Assyrian reliefs.</v>

784
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:49.510
<v Speaker 5>And you know there's a lot of them in </v>
<v Speaker 5>historians.</v>

785
00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:54.600
<v Speaker 5>Don't always know how to classify them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't tell if you want to say that.</v>

786
00:47:54.911 --> 00:47:57.160
<v Speaker 5>These are real scenes that they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>showing.</v>

787
00:47:57.161 --> 00:48:00.040
<v Speaker 5>When you see these carvings which were </v>
<v Speaker 5>probably painted at one time,</v>

788
00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:03.640
<v Speaker 5>and we're often displayed in the waiting</v>
<v Speaker 5>room before you got to see the king,</v>

789
00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:05.680
<v Speaker 5>what are you looking at while you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>cooling your heels,</v>

790
00:48:05.681 --> 00:48:09.940
<v Speaker 5>waiting to see the Assyrian King,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the things he did to the people like you</v>

791
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.770
<v Speaker 5>who may be turned against him.</v>

792
00:48:12.490 --> 00:48:17.490
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes historians think that they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>taking a sadistic sort of cruel love in </v>

793
00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:22.081
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes it's meant to be terrifying </v>

794
00:48:22.081 --> 00:48:22.081
<v Speaker 5>and they enjoy that Saddam Hussein </v>
<v Speaker 5>style.</v>

795
00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:25.630
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes they think of it as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>convention in the same way the Egyptians</v>

796
00:48:25.631 --> 00:48:27.270
<v Speaker 5>always seem to show them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

797
00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.780
<v Speaker 5>wearing certain kinds of clothing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether or not they did anymore,</v>

798
00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:34.820
<v Speaker 5>it was an artistic convention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Showing people getting their heads </v>

799
00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:34.820
<v Speaker 5>lopped off is just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

800
00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:37.240
<v Speaker 5>if you go to a Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you expect to see the Assyrian things,</v>

801
00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:39.540
<v Speaker 5>that kind of deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's who we are and it's.</v>

802
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.920
<v Speaker 5>It's a staple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nonetheless.</v>

803
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.450
<v Speaker 5>One of my favorite Assyrian reliefs </v>
<v Speaker 5>shows the aftermath of the era where the</v>

804
00:48:46.451 --> 00:48:51.130
<v Speaker 5>Assyrians finally decided to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the ongoing Isla might problem.</v>

805
00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:56.730
<v Speaker 5>It shows the Assyrian King Osher,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bonnie Paul reclining on one of those </v>

806
00:48:56.730 --> 00:48:58.410
<v Speaker 5>wonderful oriental near eastern,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

807
00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:03.420
<v Speaker 5>kinds of things that they used to lay </v>
<v Speaker 5>down on like a couch where they would </v>

808
00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.721
<v Speaker 5>have somebody feed you grapes or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something and he's sitting there </v>

809
00:49:06.721 --> 00:49:07.330
<v Speaker 5>drinking wine or eating food in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>luxury,</v>

810
00:49:07.331 --> 00:49:11.140
<v Speaker 5>really relaxing sort of pace in a garden</v>
<v Speaker 5>with palm trees,</v>

811
00:49:11.141 --> 00:49:16.141
<v Speaker 5>if I recall correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's a woman there with him and </v>

812
00:49:16.141 --> 00:49:18.751
<v Speaker 5>you get the feeling like he and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>woman are together and then right over </v>

813
00:49:18.751 --> 00:49:22.471
<v Speaker 5>near by,</v>
<v Speaker 5>up on the side of a wall or a post or a </v>

814
00:49:22.471 --> 00:49:23.530
<v Speaker 5>pillar is a head.</v>

815
00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:29.940
<v Speaker 5>The head of the Ila Mike King,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pickled or otherwise,</v>

816
00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:34.040
<v Speaker 5>and that woman who you think maybe is </v>
<v Speaker 5>osher bonded,</v>

817
00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:39.050
<v Speaker 5>Paul's wife or maybe a royal concubine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some historians think is the wife of </v>

818
00:49:39.341 --> 00:49:44.341
<v Speaker 5>that elamite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She having to be there with the person </v>

819
00:49:44.341 --> 00:49:47.791
<v Speaker 5>who killed him and have him looking on </v>
<v Speaker 5>body list the whole time at the </v>

820
00:49:47.791 --> 00:49:51.670
<v Speaker 5>Assyrians just had this wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 5>historical reputation for something that</v>

821
00:49:51.671 --> 00:49:54.610
<v Speaker 5>once again is cinematic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's not color,</v>

822
00:49:54.611 --> 00:49:56.110
<v Speaker 5>it's not like Hurghada tests and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

823
00:49:56.111 --> 00:50:01.111
<v Speaker 5>We don't have it in color,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a really scary black and white </v>

824
00:50:01.111 --> 00:50:04.951
<v Speaker 5>horror film.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're on the receiving end of a </v>

825
00:50:04.951 --> 00:50:06.400
<v Speaker 5>series and violence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should point out that,</v>

826
00:50:06.401 --> 00:50:11.401
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>focusing so much on geopolitics and the </v>

827
00:50:11.401 --> 00:50:11.401
<v Speaker 5>Syrian foreign policy may,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

828
00:50:11.401 --> 00:50:14.330
<v Speaker 5>sort of colored the picture in a very </v>
<v Speaker 5>negative way because to live in,</v>

829
00:50:14.331 --> 00:50:17.110
<v Speaker 5>in the Syrian city during this time </v>
<v Speaker 5>period might've been awesome.</v>

830
00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:19.300
<v Speaker 5>I might might've been the height of </v>
<v Speaker 5>civilization,</v>

831
00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:20.110
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

832
00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.630
<v Speaker 5>it was a society that was in some </v>
<v Speaker 5>respects,</v>

833
00:50:22.631 --> 00:50:24.850
<v Speaker 5>one of the most literate at all time </v>
<v Speaker 5>periods.</v>

834
00:50:24.851 --> 00:50:26.770
<v Speaker 5>It was wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was cultured.</v>

835
00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:28.790
<v Speaker 5>Might have been great to live in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Siri.</v>

836
00:50:28.791 --> 00:50:31.080
<v Speaker 5>You just didn't want to be on the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>end of a,</v>

837
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:35.270
<v Speaker 5>of foreign policy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And from about 7:45</v>

838
00:50:35.271 --> 00:50:37.680
<v Speaker 5>BC to about the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

839
00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:41.780
<v Speaker 5>early six hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people were and very few people</v>

840
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:46.960
<v Speaker 5>came away doing very well after that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They systematically battered down the </v>

841
00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:49.970
<v Speaker 5>structures of this region.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now battering down the structures of the</v>

842
00:50:49.971 --> 00:50:51.530
<v Speaker 5>region.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're very important.</v>

843
00:50:51.531 --> 00:50:56.531
<v Speaker 5>If you wanted to kind of make it a </v>
<v Speaker 5>mineable to being incorporated into a </v>

844
00:50:56.531 --> 00:51:00.530
<v Speaker 5>single political entity like an empire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's individualistic.</v>

845
00:51:00.531 --> 00:51:05.531
<v Speaker 5>Nature had to be curtailed somewhat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem will come when the unifying </v>

846
00:51:05.541 --> 00:51:10.541
<v Speaker 5>force that did this disappears to get an</v>
<v Speaker 5>idea by the way of how many peoples </v>

847
00:51:11.031 --> 00:51:16.031
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about here and as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>wonderful way to sort of contradict the </v>

848
00:51:16.031 --> 00:51:19.460
<v Speaker 5>earlier way the story was told,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was focusing on people's ethnicity</v>

849
00:51:19.461 --> 00:51:20.930
<v Speaker 5>a lot and to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

850
00:51:20.931 --> 00:51:24.470
<v Speaker 5>the Assyrians were submitted and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Iranian people's,</v>

851
00:51:24.471 --> 00:51:27.140
<v Speaker 5>the medes and the Persians were Indo </v>
<v Speaker 5>European,</v>

852
00:51:27.141 --> 00:51:32.141
<v Speaker 5>and all that is to realize when you deal</v>
<v Speaker 5>with a place that is so filled with </v>

853
00:51:32.481 --> 00:51:35.240
<v Speaker 5>different ethnic groups,</v>
<v Speaker 5>intermarrying living together,</v>

854
00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.690
<v Speaker 5>that it doesn't take very long for </v>
<v Speaker 5>people's languages to change.</v>

855
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:41.450
<v Speaker 5>Which used to be the way we judged who </v>
<v Speaker 5>was whom.</v>

856
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:47.290
<v Speaker 5>It also means that the job of any </v>
<v Speaker 5>unifying force that wants to turn all </v>

857
00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:51.671
<v Speaker 5>these different freedom loving groups </v>
<v Speaker 5>into a single political entity is huge.</v>

858
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:54.840
<v Speaker 5>Historian will durant tries to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

859
00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:57.170
<v Speaker 5>lay the foundation and and basically </v>
<v Speaker 5>says,</v>

860
00:51:57.171 --> 00:51:58.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just so you know,</v>

861
00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:03.370
<v Speaker 5>look at how many peoples there are in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this part of the world and they're all </v>

862
00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:06.521
<v Speaker 5>interacting all the time and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>intermarrying and to me it's an ethnic </v>

863
00:52:06.521 --> 00:52:06.521
<v Speaker 5>melting pot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

864
00:52:06.521 --> 00:52:09.650
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do a distant and yet discerning eye.</v>

865
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:13.670
<v Speaker 5>The Near East in the days of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Nebuchadrezzar would have seemed like an</v>

866
00:52:13.671 --> 00:52:18.440
<v Speaker 5>ocean in which vast swarms of human </v>
<v Speaker 5>beings moved about in turmoil,</v>

867
00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:22.700
<v Speaker 5>forming and dissolve in groups in </v>
<v Speaker 5>slaving are being enslaved,</v>

868
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:27.730
<v Speaker 5>eating or being eaten,</v>
<v Speaker 5>killing or getting killed endlessly </v>

869
00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:30.260
<v Speaker 5>behind and around the great empires,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Egypt,</v>

870
00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:31.970
<v Speaker 5>Babylonia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Assyria,</v>

871
00:52:31.971 --> 00:52:35.480
<v Speaker 5>and Persia flowered this medley of half </v>
<v Speaker 5>nomad.</v>

872
00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:40.480
<v Speaker 5>Half settled tribes can marion's </v>
<v Speaker 5>colleague Ian's Kapito oceans,</v>

873
00:52:40.641 --> 00:52:45.380
<v Speaker 5>but Finian's Ash Caymanians Messinians </v>
<v Speaker 5>me own Ian's carions,</v>

874
00:52:45.381 --> 00:52:48.470
<v Speaker 5>like Ian's pamphlet to presidions </v>
<v Speaker 5>Lakini,</v>

875
00:52:48.471 --> 00:52:51.080
<v Speaker 5>Ian's Philistines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Amorites Canaanites,</v>

876
00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:52.410
<v Speaker 5>Eda,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mites ammonites,</v>

877
00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:54.620
<v Speaker 5>the Moabites,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a hundred other peoples,</v>

878
00:52:54.621 --> 00:52:57.530
<v Speaker 5>each of which felt itself the center of </v>
<v Speaker 5>geography and history.</v>

879
00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:02.680
<v Speaker 5>And would have marveled at the ignorant </v>
<v Speaker 5>prejudice of a historian who would </v>

880
00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:06.281
<v Speaker 5>reduce them to a paragraph and a quote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got a bunch of historians who talk </v>

881
00:53:06.711 --> 00:53:11.711
<v Speaker 5>about how difficult the task is to Meld </v>
<v Speaker 5>all these individualistic different </v>

882
00:53:11.711 --> 00:53:15.140
<v Speaker 5>peoples into a single political entity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chester star writing in the middle of 19</v>

883
00:53:15.141 --> 00:53:17.060
<v Speaker 5>sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put it this way,</v>

884
00:53:17.061 --> 00:53:22.061
<v Speaker 5>as he tries to sort of counterbalance </v>
<v Speaker 5>this ruthless image the Assyrians have </v>

885
00:53:22.061 --> 00:53:23.660
<v Speaker 5>with the job they're trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he writes,</v>

886
00:53:23.661 --> 00:53:28.661
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this spirit perhaps proves not so much </v>

887
00:53:28.661 --> 00:53:29.900
<v Speaker 5>that the Assyrians were in human </v>
<v Speaker 5>monsters.</v>

888
00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:34.130
<v Speaker 5>As it shows the sternness required to </v>
<v Speaker 5>break and harness the Near East.</v>

889
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:39.400
<v Speaker 5>The Assyrian period was in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the greatest turning points in </v>

890
00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:42.851
<v Speaker 5>the civilized history of the area,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and in this fact must be sought the </v>

891
00:53:42.851 --> 00:53:44.930
<v Speaker 5>justification for the booty and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>tribute of empire.</v>

892
00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:48.170
<v Speaker 5>If Empire needs justification </v>
<v Speaker 5>politically,</v>

893
00:53:48.171 --> 00:53:53.171
<v Speaker 5>such kings as tig left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The third took decisive steps towards </v>

894
00:53:53.171 --> 00:53:55.640
<v Speaker 5>uniting the Fertile Crescent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The next grade empire,</v>

895
00:53:55.760 --> 00:54:00.260
<v Speaker 5>the Persian reaped the benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so could afford to exercise its sway</v>

896
00:54:00.261 --> 00:54:01.790
<v Speaker 5>in a more lenient style.</v>

897
00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:07.480
<v Speaker 5>And quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is actually key to one of the </v>

898
00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:10.231
<v Speaker 5>things we've been talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fact that even though the Greeks </v>

899
00:54:10.231 --> 00:54:10.231
<v Speaker 5>portrayed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

900
00:54:10.231 --> 00:54:14.430
<v Speaker 5>the Persians as sort of darth vader and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the empire history outside the Greeks </v>

901
00:54:14.590 --> 00:54:18.250
<v Speaker 5>knew them as a comparatively tolerant </v>
<v Speaker 5>empire,</v>

902
00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:23.430
<v Speaker 5>comparatively lenient,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who were they being compared to the </v>

903
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:27.460
<v Speaker 5>Assyrians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it may have taken what the Assyrians</v>

904
00:54:27.461 --> 00:54:32.461
<v Speaker 5>did to make an empire that was docile </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough for the Persians to treat them </v>

905
00:54:32.461 --> 00:54:37.411
<v Speaker 5>that way and have it all work out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should also point out that there are </v>

906
00:54:37.881 --> 00:54:42.881
<v Speaker 5>quite a few historians that would </v>
<v Speaker 5>suggest that the Assyrians have another </v>

907
00:54:42.881 --> 00:54:47.441
<v Speaker 5>legacy that we should potentially credit</v>
<v Speaker 5>them with a much more noble sounding </v>

908
00:54:48.081 --> 00:54:48.740
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

909
00:54:48.741 --> 00:54:53.741
<v Speaker 5>despite the horrific marketing and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>frightful branding of the Assyrians,</v>

910
00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:57.440
<v Speaker 5>perhaps you might look at them during </v>
<v Speaker 5>this time period,</v>

911
00:54:57.441 --> 00:55:02.060
<v Speaker 5>depending on your viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In more of a captain America style role,</v>

912
00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:07.480
<v Speaker 5>fending off the hordes of barbarism from</v>
<v Speaker 5>swamping the civilized world with their,</v>

913
00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:11.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>murder and robbery.</v>

914
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.440
<v Speaker 5>Because in the last years of the seven </v>
<v Speaker 5>hundreds bce,</v>

915
00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:22.030
<v Speaker 5>the Uhlmann Monda breakthrough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when they do,</v>

916
00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:27.810
<v Speaker 5>it will take the greatest military of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that age to be able to resist and go up </v>

917
00:55:29.441 --> 00:55:33.520
<v Speaker 5>against what is a revolutionary military</v>
<v Speaker 5>challenge.</v>

918
00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:39.270
<v Speaker 5>The first peoples in history probably </v>
<v Speaker 5>who had to try to figure out how you </v>

919
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:43.510
<v Speaker 5>defeat an army where everyone in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>army is mounted on horseback.</v>

920
00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:50.100
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Our modern era is so different than how </v>

921
00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:53.490
<v Speaker 5>the dynamics of warfare worked for most </v>
<v Speaker 5>of human history that at sometimes.</v>

922
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:58.990
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes we have to reintroduce the</v>
<v Speaker 5>more obvious things to sort of click a </v>

923
00:55:58.990 --> 00:55:59.590
<v Speaker 5>light bulb on in your head and remind </v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

924
00:55:59.591 --> 00:56:04.591
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're talking about something this </v>

925
00:56:04.591 --> 00:56:04.591
<v Speaker 5>basic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

926
00:56:04.591 --> 00:56:05.560
<v Speaker 5>I and I love these military revolution </v>
<v Speaker 5>periods.</v>

927
00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:09.370
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine what it must have been </v>
<v Speaker 5>like when the first cherry,</v>

928
00:56:09.371 --> 00:56:12.100
<v Speaker 5>it's attacked the first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

929
00:56:12.101 --> 00:56:17.101
<v Speaker 5>settled civilizations out there in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>first time in army that was composed </v>

930
00:56:17.590 --> 00:56:21.820
<v Speaker 5>entirely of people walking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had to deal with something moving at the</v>

931
00:56:21.821 --> 00:56:24.550
<v Speaker 5>speed of a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

932
00:56:24.551 --> 00:56:29.551
<v Speaker 5>the way that they usually function was </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the person inside the cherry and </v>

933
00:56:29.551 --> 00:56:32.911
<v Speaker 5>had a very powerful blow and shot arrows</v>
<v Speaker 5>at people and never really tried to </v>

934
00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:38.820
<v Speaker 5>contact them at all until they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>broken and running away so you couldn't </v>

935
00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:38.820
<v Speaker 5>catch them and they moved faster than </v>
<v Speaker 5>you did.</v>

936
00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:42.250
<v Speaker 5>And it changed warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And sometimes it's funny by the way,</v>

937
00:56:42.251 --> 00:56:43.650
<v Speaker 5>to read some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

938
00:56:43.651 --> 00:56:48.651
<v Speaker 5>the records that have been kept that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>have from some of these very early </v>

939
00:56:48.651 --> 00:56:51.391
<v Speaker 5>chariots societies and you realize how </v>
<v Speaker 5>little they know about horses because </v>

940
00:56:51.391 --> 00:56:53.620
<v Speaker 5>people who knew anything about horses </v>
<v Speaker 5>are these really high paid,</v>

941
00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:56.470
<v Speaker 5>important individuals and they have this</v>
<v Speaker 5>hidden knowledge about,</v>

942
00:56:56.790 --> 00:57:01.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's how you take care of the feet of </v>

943
00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:01.790
<v Speaker 5>a horse and here's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they get bloat,</v>

944
00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:03.670
<v Speaker 5>I mean things that today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bazillions of people know back then.</v>

945
00:57:03.671 --> 00:57:06.100
<v Speaker 5>This was like privileged information,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how you care for these things,</v>

946
00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:06.430
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

947
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:12.500
<v Speaker 5>And the Horse in the subtle societies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Egypt,</v>

948
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:15.100
<v Speaker 5>the Babylon's in the series.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At first you can see that they,</v>

949
00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:17.680
<v Speaker 5>that they don't know how to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the animal.</v>

950
00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:19.900
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are wonderful little figurines and</v>

951
00:57:19.901 --> 00:57:21.820
<v Speaker 5>whatnot showing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Egyptian,</v>

952
00:57:21.821 --> 00:57:26.821
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's like an Egyptian scout during</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe the first 200 years or something </v>

953
00:57:26.821 --> 00:57:31.130
<v Speaker 5>that the Egyptians were really trying to</v>
<v Speaker 5>use horses and he's sitting way back </v>

954
00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:34.381
<v Speaker 5>over the tail of the horse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he hasn't even figured out that </v>

955
00:57:34.381 --> 00:57:37.471
<v Speaker 5>that's not the right spot to sit in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we take it for granted that this is </v>

956
00:57:37.471 --> 00:57:41.521
<v Speaker 5>an obvious thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>might not have been about 1000 bce.</v>

957
00:57:42.011 --> 00:57:47.011
<v Speaker 5>Cavalry first appears and it generally </v>
<v Speaker 5>appears in,</v>

958
00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:47.710
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

959
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:52.770
<v Speaker 5>in a way that once again makes you think</v>
<v Speaker 5>that these people are not very </v>

960
00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:54.400
<v Speaker 5>comfortable writing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And remember there are no saddles,</v>

961
00:57:54.401 --> 00:57:56.470
<v Speaker 5>there are no spurs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are no stirrups.</v>

962
00:57:56.910 --> 00:58:01.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a lot of knack to knowing</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you're doing here.</v>

963
00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:06.660
<v Speaker 5>And remember also that riding horses can</v>
<v Speaker 5>be injurous and fatal if you're not used</v>

964
00:58:07.721 --> 00:58:08.140
<v Speaker 5>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

965
00:58:08.141 --> 00:58:13.141
<v Speaker 5>And none of these people are growing up </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing a whole lot of horse riding and </v>

966
00:58:13.141 --> 00:58:16.890
<v Speaker 5>about 900 bce you can see carving </v>
<v Speaker 5>showing a Syrian cavalry,</v>

967
00:58:17.051 --> 00:58:18.820
<v Speaker 5>which is probably,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you think about it,</v>

968
00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:21.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cutting edge for the time period for the</v>

969
00:58:21.281 --> 00:58:26.281
<v Speaker 5>subtle civilizations and they send the </v>
<v Speaker 5>cavalry riders out in Pairs because one </v>

970
00:58:26.801 --> 00:58:30.160
<v Speaker 5>guy has to hold the reigns for the other</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy's horse.</v>

971
00:58:30.161 --> 00:58:32.380
<v Speaker 5>When the other guy decides he's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 5>shoot or anything.</v>

972
00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:37.800
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't even feel comfortable enough </v>

973
00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:37.800
<v Speaker 5>to shoot and ride.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

974
00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:39.970
<v Speaker 5>independently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to have someone there to hold</v>

975
00:58:39.971 --> 00:58:40.800
<v Speaker 5>the horse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you do it.</v>

976
00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:42.610
<v Speaker 5>Another words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can watch the evolution,</v>

977
00:58:42.611 --> 00:58:47.611
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's different when the armies from the </v>

978
00:58:47.611 --> 00:58:49.000
<v Speaker 5>Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ancient near east first run into the</v>

979
00:58:49.001 --> 00:58:54.001
<v Speaker 5>steppe troops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That will make up one of the dominant </v>

980
00:58:54.001 --> 00:58:57.241
<v Speaker 5>important tribal areas in world history </v>
<v Speaker 5>for almost ever.</v>

981
00:58:57.551 --> 00:59:02.551
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's only the last couple hundred</v>
<v Speaker 5>years that the Eurasian Steppe part of </v>

982
00:59:02.591 --> 00:59:05.200
<v Speaker 5>which you would refer to as Central Asia</v>
<v Speaker 5>today,</v>

983
00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:07.480
<v Speaker 5>Kazakhstan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kyrgyzstan,</v>

984
00:59:07.481 --> 00:59:12.481
<v Speaker 5>those kinds of places.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Certainly in the last couple hundred </v>

985
00:59:12.481 --> 00:59:14.880
<v Speaker 5>years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those places have not been massively </v>

986
00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:16.651
<v Speaker 5>relevant to what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was reading a book not that long ago </v>

987
00:59:16.651 --> 00:59:19.510
<v Speaker 5>that it was going into all of the things</v>
<v Speaker 5>that China and Russia have.</v>

988
00:59:19.511 --> 00:59:22.190
<v Speaker 5>The 17 hundreds see is only</v>

989
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:27.190
<v Speaker 5>a couple hundred years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the things that they had to do to </v>

990
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:28.700
<v Speaker 5>deal with the tribes on the step and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy because,</v>

991
00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:30.740
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you look at history,</v>

992
00:59:30.741 --> 00:59:35.741
<v Speaker 5>you become very accustomed to watching </v>
<v Speaker 5>the so called civilized society is just </v>

993
00:59:36.711 --> 00:59:39.050
<v Speaker 5>rolling over tribal peoples,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

994
00:59:39.051 --> 00:59:44.051
<v Speaker 5>at a certain point in history once,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once the momentum gets going and you </v>

995
00:59:44.051 --> 00:59:46.700
<v Speaker 5>have like Julius Caesar and Roman armies</v>
<v Speaker 5>just rolling over Celtic society,</v>

996
00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:50.780
<v Speaker 5>you're already prepared to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>part where the colonial Europeans,</v>

997
00:59:50.781 --> 00:59:55.781
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>show up on these distant shores and run </v>

998
00:59:55.781 --> 00:59:55.781
<v Speaker 5>into people with wooden clubs and bows </v>
<v Speaker 5>and arrows.</v>

999
00:59:55.781 --> 00:59:56.390
<v Speaker 5>When you've got guns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1000
00:59:56.391 --> 00:59:57.920
<v Speaker 5>it's a foregone conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1001
00:59:59.670 --> 01:00:03.600
<v Speaker 5>But you look at the step and you see the</v>
<v Speaker 5>one place in history,</v>

1002
01:00:03.601 --> 01:00:08.601
<v Speaker 5>we're for a number of different reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The odds are much more equal between </v>

1003
01:00:08.601 --> 01:00:10.830
<v Speaker 5>settled and tribal peoples.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

1004
01:00:11.250 --> 01:00:16.250
<v Speaker 5>it's likely that the odds in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting power in terms of manpower was </v>

1005
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:20.361
<v Speaker 5>probably pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The settler societies had a lot more </v>

1006
01:00:20.361 --> 01:00:20.700
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of them weren't fighters.</v>

1007
01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:25.730
<v Speaker 5>The tribal societies usually had most of</v>
<v Speaker 5>their mail people as fighters</v>

1008
01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.080
<v Speaker 5>and some females.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

1009
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:33.760
<v Speaker 5>the weapons technology was probably </v>
<v Speaker 5>comparable.</v>

1010
01:00:33.761 --> 01:00:38.761
<v Speaker 5>The the bose used by this step.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are famously some of the best </v>

1011
01:00:38.761 --> 01:00:42.960
<v Speaker 5>ever made,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there would've been other things </v>

1012
01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:42.960
<v Speaker 5>that the settled so called settled </v>
<v Speaker 5>societies had in their favor,</v>

1013
01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:46.870
<v Speaker 5>so probably a wash there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but imagine imagine the native Americans</v>

1014
01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:52.200
<v Speaker 5>with a rough parody and fighting men and</v>
<v Speaker 5>a rough parody in weapons technology.</v>

1015
01:00:53.561 --> 01:00:55.930
<v Speaker 5>What would the native Americans have </v>
<v Speaker 5>done to the settlers?</v>

1016
01:00:55.931 --> 01:00:58.000
<v Speaker 5>Then?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who knows,</v>

1017
01:00:58.001 --> 01:01:03.001
<v Speaker 5>but at least it's a fair fight added </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the geographic conditions and the </v>

1018
01:01:03.001 --> 01:01:03.340
<v Speaker 5>distance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1019
01:01:03.341 --> 01:01:08.341
<v Speaker 5>This is a harsh environment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The steps sometimes if you're not </v>

1020
01:01:08.341 --> 01:01:09.130
<v Speaker 5>adapted to it and it's a long way from </v>
<v Speaker 5>point a to point b,</v>

1021
01:01:09.131 --> 01:01:14.131
<v Speaker 5>no matter where you're going and you had</v>
<v Speaker 5>a part of the world that was protected </v>

1022
01:01:14.131 --> 01:01:18.181
<v Speaker 5>by step peoples for Millennia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where they maintained their way of life </v>

1023
01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:20.620
<v Speaker 5>and were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shall we say,</v>

1024
01:01:20.621 --> 01:01:21.580
<v Speaker 5>relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>relevant,</v>

1025
01:01:21.581 --> 01:01:23.200
<v Speaker 5>is a good non biased in any direction.</v>

1026
01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.200
<v Speaker 5>Word relevant to the societies and world</v>
<v Speaker 5>powers around them and we've known them </v>

1027
01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:28.480
<v Speaker 5>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1028
01:01:28.481 --> 01:01:33.481
<v Speaker 5>We've seen wave after wave of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people come forward from the Magyars to </v>

1029
01:01:33.481 --> 01:01:34.510
<v Speaker 5>the Turks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the hands to the Hmong goals.</v>

1030
01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:39.030
<v Speaker 5>This is the first period in recorded </v>
<v Speaker 5>history where these people break through</v>

1031
01:01:39.031 --> 01:01:44.031
<v Speaker 5>and someone's there to record it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's always been a historical school </v>

1032
01:01:44.441 --> 01:01:49.441
<v Speaker 5>of thought that chariot invasions from </v>
<v Speaker 5>Central Asia long before this period </v>

1033
01:01:49.441 --> 01:01:51.640
<v Speaker 5>represent earlier versions of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>kinds of invasions,</v>

1034
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.480
<v Speaker 5>but this is the first one recorded where</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get to see,</v>

1035
01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:58.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the kinds of step armies you will expect</v>

1036
01:01:58.451 --> 01:02:03.451
<v Speaker 5>for the next 2000 years mounted on </v>
<v Speaker 5>horseback with people who are.</v>

1037
01:02:04.690 --> 01:02:06.550
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as we said about the Spartans,</v>

1038
01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:11.560
<v Speaker 5>that they were sort of a laboratory </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiment to see if a culture could </v>

1039
01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:14.581
<v Speaker 5>create a super soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The step societies are are kind of a </v>

1040
01:02:14.581 --> 01:02:14.650
<v Speaker 5>laboratory experiment too.</v>

1041
01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:19.770
<v Speaker 5>If you put people on horseback from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time when they're toddlers and put a bow</v>

1042
01:02:19.771 --> 01:02:24.771
<v Speaker 5>in their hand from not much later and </v>
<v Speaker 5>have them ride all the time and do </v>

1043
01:02:24.771 --> 01:02:29.271
<v Speaker 5>everything on horseback and use those </v>
<v Speaker 5>bose continually and develop tactics </v>

1044
01:02:29.271 --> 01:02:30.630
<v Speaker 5>where they never really come into </v>
<v Speaker 5>contact with peoples.</v>

1045
01:02:30.631 --> 01:02:31.530
<v Speaker 5>They don't want to come in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1046
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:37.130
<v Speaker 5>what do you end up with?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the answer is you end up with a </v>

1047
01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:41.451
<v Speaker 5>weapons system that was so effective </v>
<v Speaker 5>that even after guns were developed.</v>

1048
01:02:43.321 --> 01:02:45.570
<v Speaker 5>Modern societies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're having a tough time,</v>

1049
01:02:45.571 --> 01:02:50.571
<v Speaker 5>pardon the pun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>corralling these people even up until </v>

1050
01:02:50.571 --> 01:02:54.021
<v Speaker 5>relatively modern times now when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>think about how long that is,</v>

1051
01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:57.480
<v Speaker 5>people trying to contend with the step </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1052
01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:02.780
<v Speaker 5>Think about how much admiration we </v>
<v Speaker 5>should have with the first people who </v>

1053
01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:04.380
<v Speaker 5>had to try with no track record or </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience.</v>

1054
01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:10.520
<v Speaker 5>The Assyrians would develop a kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>broad policy of dealing with these </v>

1055
01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:14.280
<v Speaker 5>tribal step people that resembles what </v>
<v Speaker 5>very sophisticated people who dealt with</v>

1056
01:03:14.281 --> 01:03:19.281
<v Speaker 5>them for a very long time came up with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Chinese and the Byzantines for </v>

1057
01:03:19.281 --> 01:03:19.281
<v Speaker 5>example.</v>

1058
01:03:19.281 --> 01:03:21.210
<v Speaker 5>Would you use a mix of diplomacy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>intermarriage,</v>

1059
01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:24.090
<v Speaker 5>warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

1060
01:03:24.091 --> 01:03:27.900
<v Speaker 5>keeping the tribes divided and fighting </v>
<v Speaker 5>amongst themselves and the Assyrians did</v>

1061
01:03:27.901 --> 01:03:30.600
<v Speaker 5>all this stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They use some of these people as allies.</v>

1062
01:03:30.601 --> 01:03:32.790
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes they'd have mercenaries who </v>
<v Speaker 5>were,</v>

1063
01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:34.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people from these tribes,</v>

1064
01:03:34.351 --> 01:03:39.351
<v Speaker 5>the tribes like the comedians in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] and the various psychotic </v>

1065
01:03:39.351 --> 01:03:42.590
<v Speaker 5>tribes and the massive ged.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have all these wonderful tribal </v>

1066
01:03:42.590 --> 01:03:44.310
<v Speaker 5>confederations and one is scarier than </v>
<v Speaker 5>the next,</v>

1067
01:03:44.311 --> 01:03:46.110
<v Speaker 5>and if you're one of those settled </v>
<v Speaker 5>society people,</v>

1068
01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:51.350
<v Speaker 5>barbarians in air quotes always scared.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You mean there was just something scary </v>

1069
01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:52.010
<v Speaker 5>to settle people about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1070
01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:55.890
<v Speaker 5>people like the celts for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Athenians are no different.</v>

1071
01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.110
<v Speaker 5>The various step peoples are no </v>
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>

1072
01:03:58.111 --> 01:03:59.520
<v Speaker 5>They're headhunters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1073
01:03:59.521 --> 01:04:04.320
<v Speaker 5>famously will drink from the skulls of </v>
<v Speaker 5>their dead enemies.</v>

1074
01:04:04.321 --> 01:04:09.260
<v Speaker 5>Make cups out of them and if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>see how the wonderful continuity of step</v>

1075
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:10.020
<v Speaker 5>culture sometimes go.</v>

1076
01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:15.020
<v Speaker 5>They were doing this in in ancient times</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they were doing this up until </v>

1077
01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:15.020
<v Speaker 5>relatively,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1078
01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.560
<v Speaker 5>goal type history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the drinking cups.</v>

1079
01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:21.150
<v Speaker 5>Golfing was a perennial favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's just a cultural thing,</v>

1080
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:26.390
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the Assyrians are hanging </v>

1081
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:27.801
<v Speaker 5>enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>heads on walls so that they can watch </v>

1082
01:04:27.801 --> 01:04:29.190
<v Speaker 5>their wife have relations with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Assyrian king who killed them.</v>

1083
01:04:29.191 --> 01:04:31.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's got their thing right.</v>

1084
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:35.400
<v Speaker 5>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know these people are scary,</v>

1085
01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:39.810
<v Speaker 5>they're effective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they are entirely mounted,</v>

1086
01:04:39.811 --> 01:04:44.811
<v Speaker 5>which means they have amazing challenges</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the militaries of the day because </v>

1087
01:04:44.811 --> 01:04:47.931
<v Speaker 5>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you move at the speed of your slowest </v>

1088
01:04:47.931 --> 01:04:47.931
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you have an entire army mounted,</v>

1089
01:04:47.931 --> 01:04:49.860
<v Speaker 5>the entire army moves at the speed of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>horse.</v>

1090
01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:55.070
<v Speaker 5>These are huge challenges and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Assyrians managed to ward off the worst </v>

1091
01:04:55.070 --> 01:04:56.400
<v Speaker 5>of the attacks and in the sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1092
01:04:56.401 --> 01:05:01.401
<v Speaker 5>you could make a case that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>protected this entire area of </v>

1093
01:05:01.401 --> 01:05:05.091
<v Speaker 5>civilization from marauding is scary </v>
<v Speaker 5>peoples who were not going to leave it </v>

1094
01:05:05.641 --> 01:05:10.641
<v Speaker 5>intact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know this because there were </v>

1095
01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:10.641
<v Speaker 5>several invasions that did break </v>
<v Speaker 5>through.</v>

1096
01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:15.260
<v Speaker 5>There's a hoard of [inaudible] that will</v>
<v Speaker 5>rape and pillage all the way down to </v>

1097
01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:18.220
<v Speaker 5>Egypt before the Egyptians either buy </v>
<v Speaker 5>them off or militarily turned</v>

1098
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:21.910
<v Speaker 2>them back and they they go bouncing </v>
<v Speaker 2>around the region like a sneaker ball.</v>

1099
01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.180
<v Speaker 2>The fact that in a lot of these step </v>
<v Speaker 2>armies,</v>

1100
01:05:25.181 --> 01:05:30.181
<v Speaker 2>every single person was mounted was also</v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary and huge in the armies of </v>

1101
01:05:32.411 --> 01:05:33.940
<v Speaker 2>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were lucky,</v>

1102
01:05:33.941 --> 01:05:36.910
<v Speaker 2>had 15 or 20 percent of their force </v>
<v Speaker 2>mounted,</v>

1103
01:05:36.911 --> 01:05:41.911
<v Speaker 2>sometimes quite a bit less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still move at the speed of your </v>

1104
01:05:41.911 --> 01:05:44.520
<v Speaker 2>slowest troops though if you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you break the cavalry officer,</v>

1105
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:49.560
<v Speaker 2>you can operate independently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll have a nice small group of </v>

1106
01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.650
<v Speaker 2>cavalry that gets overwhelmed by an </v>
<v Speaker 2>entirely mounted forest,</v>

1107
01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:55.830
<v Speaker 2>so nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and army with inventory moves at the </v>

1108
01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:58.651
<v Speaker 2>speed of infantry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These armies that the settled societies </v>

1109
01:05:58.651 --> 01:05:59.680
<v Speaker 2>in this geopolitical realm and Cheyenna </v>
<v Speaker 2>are trying to deal with,</v>

1110
01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:03.460
<v Speaker 2>move at the speed of a horse </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategically on the map.</v>

1111
01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.490
<v Speaker 2>That's a devastating thing to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>counter.</v>

1112
01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:11.520
<v Speaker 2>The fact that the Assyrians could is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>testimony to how great the greatest </v>

1113
01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.510
<v Speaker 2>military of the world had ever seen was </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how well lead.</v>

1114
01:06:14.290 --> 01:06:19.290
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could see how big the challenge was </v>

1115
01:06:19.290 --> 01:06:19.290
<v Speaker 2>in seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1116
01:06:19.290 --> 01:06:22.750
<v Speaker 2>five bce Sargon the second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arguably the greatest king of Syria ever</v>

1117
01:06:22.751 --> 01:06:27.751
<v Speaker 2>had will as an elderly man lead the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Assyrian Army in person up to modern </v>

1118
01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:36.640
<v Speaker 2>southeastern Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>near the border of neo hittite area </v>

1119
01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:41.080
<v Speaker 2>called to ball and probably fighting in </v>
<v Speaker 2>conjunction with some of these,</v>

1120
01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:41.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1121
01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:45.490
<v Speaker 2>neo hittite cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eurasian Steppe troops,</v>

1122
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:49.120
<v Speaker 2>comedians are skiff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eons and Sargon.</v>

1123
01:06:49.121 --> 01:06:54.121
<v Speaker 2>The second will disappear with the army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The body will never be recovered.</v>

1124
01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:59.230
<v Speaker 2>That is a very rare event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the body is not recovered,</v>

1125
01:06:59.231 --> 01:07:04.231
<v Speaker 2>the assumption is that nobody got out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because one of the last things you will </v>

1126
01:07:04.231 --> 01:07:06.970
<v Speaker 2>do is grab the king's body and spirited </v>
<v Speaker 2>away.</v>

1127
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:12.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like saving the flag times 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be an Egyptian king to famously</v>

1128
01:07:13.361 --> 01:07:16.510
<v Speaker 2>who was bones will stay on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>battlefield and they,</v>

1129
01:07:16.511 --> 01:07:18.340
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ended up getting it later.</v>

1130
01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:23.340
<v Speaker 2>And mummifying a body that's been </v>
<v Speaker 2>mutilated it on the battlefield for a </v>

1131
01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:28.650
<v Speaker 2>few weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can still look at the mommy </v>

1132
01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:28.650
<v Speaker 2>today and see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh wow,</v>

1133
01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:31.750
<v Speaker 2>they didn't get to him for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I on the second will never be found.</v>

1134
01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:34.710
<v Speaker 2>I've often thought it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>coincidence his son Senaca.</v>

1135
01:07:34.711 --> 01:07:38.590
<v Speaker 2>We've never actually led a force in </v>
<v Speaker 2>person when he was king.</v>

1136
01:07:38.591 --> 01:07:41.050
<v Speaker 2>He left that to the generals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's very important things in Nineveh</v>

1137
01:07:41.051 --> 01:07:43.210
<v Speaker 2>that need taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we all understand.</v>

1138
01:07:44.170 --> 01:07:49.170
<v Speaker 2>Anyone who could do that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Syrian army at the height of a </v>

1139
01:07:49.170 --> 01:07:52.330
<v Speaker 2>serious power is formidable indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1140
01:07:52.331 --> 01:07:54.160
<v Speaker 2>even though a Siri could protect some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this region,</v>

1141
01:07:54.161 --> 01:07:59.161
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't protect all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of these tribes filtered down </v>

1142
01:07:59.161 --> 01:08:00.190
<v Speaker 2>into the area where the people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>ostensibly talking about,</v>

1143
01:08:00.191 --> 01:08:02.590
<v Speaker 2>here are the medes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Persians,</v>

1144
01:08:02.591 --> 01:08:04.540
<v Speaker 2>the Elamites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Zagros mountains,</v>

1145
01:08:04.541 --> 01:08:09.541
<v Speaker 2>Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The peoples in this region are about to </v>

1146
01:08:09.541 --> 01:08:12.970
<v Speaker 2>go through a one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two punch that will change them forever.</v>

1147
01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 2>The second of these punches will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>delivered by</v>

1148
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:17.750
<v Speaker 5>the Assyrians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Surprise,</v>

1149
01:08:17.751 --> 01:08:19.520
<v Speaker 5>surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were throwing punches everywhere.</v>

1150
01:08:19.521 --> 01:08:24.521
<v Speaker 5>Why shouldn't this region get hit to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>first will be delivered by these step </v>

1151
01:08:24.521 --> 01:08:28.871
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these tribes of [inaudible] and </v>

1152
01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:30.920
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] who will at a certain point </v>
<v Speaker 5>I said filtered.</v>

1153
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:35.950
<v Speaker 5>I thought that was a nice ambiguous way </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you don't really know what </v>

1154
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:39.491
<v Speaker 5>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the traditional idea is that the </v>

1155
01:08:39.491 --> 01:08:41.381
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] and the comedians attacked </v>
<v Speaker 5>and broke into an assaulted the needs in</v>

1156
01:08:41.871 --> 01:08:46.871
<v Speaker 5>a giant invasion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's even a year associated with its </v>

1157
01:08:46.871 --> 01:08:46.871
<v Speaker 5>6:53</v>
<v Speaker 5>bce,</v>

1158
01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:50.600
<v Speaker 5>which if you think about it's like 50 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years after Sargon,</v>

1159
01:08:50.601 --> 01:08:52.220
<v Speaker 5>the second dies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1160
01:08:52.221 --> 01:08:53.390
<v Speaker 5>up into ball,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1161
01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:58.480
<v Speaker 5>About 55,</v>
<v Speaker 5>60 years since these horse people first </v>

1162
01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:03.041
<v Speaker 5>appeared and they're still managing to </v>
<v Speaker 5>totally disrupt in a huge areas of this </v>

1163
01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:07.010
<v Speaker 5>geopolitical ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Only use that word from now on.</v>

1164
01:09:07.011 --> 01:09:08.060
<v Speaker 5>We all know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1165
01:09:09.610 --> 01:09:13.880
<v Speaker 5>Filtered is a good word though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it also allows room for a theory</v>

1166
01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:19.100
<v Speaker 5>where warfare sort of doesn't dominate </v>
<v Speaker 5>the reasoning behind why all of a sudden</v>

1167
01:09:19.101 --> 01:09:22.280
<v Speaker 5>all these central Asian tribes moved </v>
<v Speaker 5>into this part of Iran.</v>

1168
01:09:23.690 --> 01:09:26.780
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that's really changed </v>
<v Speaker 5>since I first started studying the story</v>

1169
01:09:26.781 --> 01:09:30.050
<v Speaker 5>is the concept that historians have </v>
<v Speaker 5>about who these medallions were and what</v>

1170
01:09:30.051 --> 01:09:32.180
<v Speaker 5>kind of state they had when I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>growing up.</v>

1171
01:09:32.181 --> 01:09:37.181
<v Speaker 5>The history is all made.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sound like the means were like the </v>

1172
01:09:37.181 --> 01:09:37.520
<v Speaker 5>Babylonians and the Assyrians by this </v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

1173
01:09:37.521 --> 01:09:42.521
<v Speaker 5>a centralized state with cities and </v>
<v Speaker 5>governments and bureaucracies and all </v>

1174
01:09:42.521 --> 01:09:43.220
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Historians today,</v>

1175
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:45.290
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not one I just read the best,</v>

1176
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:50.410
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they make it sound much more like the </v>

1177
01:09:50.410 --> 01:09:52.841
<v Speaker 5>current state of theory is that these </v>
<v Speaker 5>needs are much more tribal than we had </v>

1178
01:09:52.841 --> 01:09:57.551
<v Speaker 5>previously assumed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if so might not be that much </v>

1179
01:09:57.551 --> 01:09:59.930
<v Speaker 5>different than these [inaudible] Syrians</v>
<v Speaker 5>coming into their area.</v>

1180
01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:03.620
<v Speaker 5>This could be much more like a tribal </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship.</v>

1181
01:10:03.621 --> 01:10:08.621
<v Speaker 5>What did we say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The medes and the Persians were second </v>

1182
01:10:08.621 --> 01:10:10.451
<v Speaker 5>cousins who fought.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes these step people's are like </v>

1183
01:10:10.451 --> 01:10:13.391
<v Speaker 5>third cousins who fight a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember they could allegedly speak to </v>

1184
01:10:13.591 --> 01:10:15.750
<v Speaker 5>each other without the use of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>translator.</v>

1185
01:10:16.230 --> 01:10:18.870
<v Speaker 5>When you're that close to another </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1186
01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:24.200
<v Speaker 5>What appears to be a conquest from </v>
<v Speaker 5>outside might be much more like dynastic</v>

1187
01:10:24.241 --> 01:10:29.241
<v Speaker 5>marriage or someone having to change </v>
<v Speaker 5>their alliance status or becoming a </v>

1188
01:10:29.241 --> 01:10:33.690
<v Speaker 5>vassal of someone else or having to pay </v>
<v Speaker 5>tribute Hurghada tissue might see all of</v>

1189
01:10:33.691 --> 01:10:37.240
<v Speaker 5>that stuff as a version of slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when he calls it slave,</v>

1190
01:10:37.241 --> 01:10:39.690
<v Speaker 5>where we might be picturing something </v>
<v Speaker 5>else entirely</v>

1191
01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:46.220
<v Speaker 5>erotic just says that the domination of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the needs last 28 years and an </v>

1192
01:10:48.421 --> 01:10:53.421
<v Speaker 5>interesting little in a tidbit that </v>
<v Speaker 5>might confirm what he says is during </v>

1193
01:10:53.521 --> 01:10:54.870
<v Speaker 5>that time period,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Assyrians,</v>

1194
01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:59.910
<v Speaker 5>the Babylonians who keep records and who</v>
<v Speaker 5>knows and mentioned the medes from time </v>

1195
01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:01.800
<v Speaker 5>to time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>start calling everyone who lives in that</v>

1196
01:11:01.801 --> 01:11:06.801
<v Speaker 5>whole region,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the womb and Munda and recess are gummy </v>

1197
01:11:06.841 --> 01:11:11.841
<v Speaker 5>among others.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Suggest that this might mean that the </v>

1198
01:11:11.841 --> 01:11:14.871
<v Speaker 5>entire area has just been sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>overwhelmed and that you can't tell one </v>

1199
01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:19.671
<v Speaker 5>tribe from another without a scorecard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hurghada test if you want to go with </v>

1200
01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:23.490
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tells one of his really fun stories.</v>

1201
01:11:23.491 --> 01:11:23.940
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1202
01:11:23.941 --> 01:11:28.941
<v Speaker 5>if you're like me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about how the medes eventually threw off</v>

1203
01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:32.310
<v Speaker 5>the nomadic yoke that was oppressing </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1204
01:11:32.311 --> 01:11:36.660
<v Speaker 5>And he tells a story about how they </v>
<v Speaker 5>invited the [inaudible] and leaders to a</v>

1205
01:11:36.661 --> 01:11:41.661
<v Speaker 5>banquet and then got them all drunk and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then when they were also a knee created,</v>

1206
01:11:41.881 --> 01:11:44.490
<v Speaker 5>they could hardly stand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They went in and killed them all,</v>

1207
01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:48.180
<v Speaker 5>I guess you could call that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1208
01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:51.520
<v Speaker 5>decapitating the enemy leadership </v>
<v Speaker 5>literally.</v>

1209
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:55.540
<v Speaker 5>Or maybe the tactic is drunk and mass </v>
<v Speaker 5>homicide,</v>

1210
01:11:55.541 --> 01:11:58.600
<v Speaker 5>whatever you want to call it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like a motif.</v>

1211
01:11:58.601 --> 01:12:03.601
<v Speaker 5>Another one of these recurring sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 5>things you see all throughout history </v>

1212
01:12:03.601 --> 01:12:07.081
<v Speaker 5>and the writing and one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of those aspects of the story that </v>

1213
01:12:07.081 --> 01:12:11.251
<v Speaker 5>oftentimes professional historians will </v>
<v Speaker 5>discount because after all we see this </v>

1214
01:12:11.251 --> 01:12:11.830
<v Speaker 5>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This sounds just like blah,</v>

1215
01:12:11.831 --> 01:12:12.340
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah.</v>

1216
01:12:12.370 --> 01:12:16.120
<v Speaker 5>And they're almost always right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's the weird part though.</v>

1217
01:12:16.121 --> 01:12:18.940
<v Speaker 5>This is something that you actually see </v>
<v Speaker 5>in history,</v>

1218
01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:24.180
<v Speaker 5>confirm bubbly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The relationship between using alcohol </v>

1219
01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:28.630
<v Speaker 5>as some sort of a trap to ensnare other </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who then become vulnerable.</v>

1220
01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:31.120
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've seen this in recorded history like</v>

1221
01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:36.150
<v Speaker 5>not that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Native American tribes had this </v>

1222
01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:37.950
<v Speaker 5>treatment done to them sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 5>multiple times.</v>

1223
01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.470
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what might it look in this case?</v>

1224
01:12:40.471 --> 01:12:45.471
<v Speaker 5>Like a recurring motif might actually be</v>
<v Speaker 5>a recurring historical occurrence.</v>

1225
01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:50.190
<v Speaker 5>How would you tell the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 5>In any case,</v>

1226
01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:54.120
<v Speaker 5>it'll happen again in this story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which once again makes you say,</v>

1227
01:12:54.121 --> 01:12:59.121
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is this just a recurring motif or is </v>

1228
01:12:59.121 --> 01:12:59.610
<v Speaker 5>this a tactic that worked last time?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we're trying it again.</v>

1229
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:04.800
<v Speaker 5>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somehow the medes regain in a freedom of</v>

1230
01:13:04.801 --> 01:13:07.170
<v Speaker 5>action from these people who were then </v>
<v Speaker 5>thrown out,</v>

1231
01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:12.410
<v Speaker 5>leaving behind another wonderful ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 5>strain of the central Asian bloodline </v>

1232
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:17.300
<v Speaker 5>that will run through Iran over the ages</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that will be added to with new </v>

1233
01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:17.880
<v Speaker 5>blood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes,</v>

1234
01:13:17.881 --> 01:13:19.770
<v Speaker 5>tragically from time to time.</v>

1235
01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:26.480
<v Speaker 5>The guy who is supposedly the king of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the medes during this period of </v>

1236
01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.130
<v Speaker 5>domination by the [inaudible] is a mead </v>
<v Speaker 5>name.</v>

1237
01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:30.490
<v Speaker 5>See accessories,</v>

1238
01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:36.950
<v Speaker 5>carotids his credits him with totally </v>
<v Speaker 5>reorganizing the military of the medes.</v>

1239
01:13:37.650 --> 01:13:42.650
<v Speaker 5>He says that because the accessories </v>
<v Speaker 5>becomes the first Asian leader too,</v>

1240
01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:46.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>separate and army into component parts,</v>

1241
01:13:46.351 --> 01:13:48.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>archers and Spearman and cavalry.</v>

1242
01:13:48.661 --> 01:13:51.480
<v Speaker 5>He says before that they all fought </v>
<v Speaker 5>together in a chaotic mass,</v>

1243
01:13:51.481 --> 01:13:56.481
<v Speaker 5>which is not true at all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but some historians think he's </v>

1244
01:13:56.481 --> 01:14:00.291
<v Speaker 5>preserving some sort of a memory of this</v>
<v Speaker 5>important medean ruler who reorganize </v>

1245
01:14:01.031 --> 01:14:06.031
<v Speaker 5>the military and made it much more </v>
<v Speaker 5>powerful and considering what he was </v>

1246
01:14:06.031 --> 01:14:08.961
<v Speaker 5>about to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There seems to be some historical </v>

1247
01:14:08.961 --> 01:14:10.860
<v Speaker 5>evidence for the medes all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 5>becoming very formidable indeed.</v>

1248
01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:16.120
<v Speaker 5>Right about the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When the great traditionally great power</v>

1249
01:14:16.121 --> 01:14:21.060
<v Speaker 5>in that region gets mortally wounded by </v>
<v Speaker 5>Assyria,</v>

1250
01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:26.990
<v Speaker 5>and we alluded to this earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of a serious laying waste to all </v>

1251
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.750
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1252
01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:30.190
<v Speaker 5>competitors for their superpower status,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1253
01:14:30.190 --> 01:14:33.880
<v Speaker 5>There's not going to be anybody that </v>
<v Speaker 5>even gets to put up a little resistance.</v>

1254
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:35.920
<v Speaker 5>The elamites,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once again,</v>

1255
01:14:35.921 --> 01:14:37.720
<v Speaker 5>get on the hit list for doing the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1256
01:14:37.721 --> 01:14:41.500
<v Speaker 5>They always do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Babylon revolt against the Syria.</v>

1257
01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:46.770
<v Speaker 5>Elom helps Babylon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As soon as the Assyrians take care of </v>

1258
01:14:46.770 --> 01:14:50.161
<v Speaker 5>Babylon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they come for the elamites and this </v>

1259
01:14:50.161 --> 01:14:52.610
<v Speaker 5>happens under the last of the Great </v>
<v Speaker 5>Assyrian rulers is Bonnie,</v>

1260
01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:54.730
<v Speaker 5>Paul Oscher,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bonnie Paul,</v>

1261
01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.620
<v Speaker 5>who's who's a very long ruling guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and at the start of his reign,</v>

1262
01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:04.240
<v Speaker 5>the empire could not be at a higher </v>
<v Speaker 5>place by the end of his reign.</v>

1263
01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:06.880
<v Speaker 5>You know he's writing these.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Woe is me tales.</v>

1264
01:15:06.881 --> 01:15:09.100
<v Speaker 5>What did I do to have the gods turned </v>
<v Speaker 5>against me?</v>

1265
01:15:09.101 --> 01:15:10.980
<v Speaker 5>Everything sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1266
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:12.760
<v Speaker 5>but all die soon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least kinds of.</v>

1267
01:15:12.761 --> 01:15:17.761
<v Speaker 5>I'm in a writings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Syria will go from the height of its </v>

1268
01:15:18.191 --> 01:15:23.191
<v Speaker 5>fortunes to 1945,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Berlin follow the Third Reich </v>

1269
01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:28.260
<v Speaker 5>devastation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never to rise again in a very short </v>

1270
01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:32.911
<v Speaker 5>period of time and some have argued that</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of the reason why is because of </v>

1271
01:15:34.121 --> 01:15:39.121
<v Speaker 5>what they did to the people around them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They destroyed the other powers who </v>

1272
01:15:39.571 --> 01:15:42.330
<v Speaker 5>might have acted as barriers against new</v>
<v Speaker 5>rising ones.</v>

1273
01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:47.340
<v Speaker 5>Whether the new rising ones are </v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] and [inaudible] from the </v>

1274
01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:51.020
<v Speaker 5>Eurasian Steppe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or whether they're an obscure tribal </v>

1275
01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:54.830
<v Speaker 5>people known as the medes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who all of a sudden they're really </v>

1276
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:57.351
<v Speaker 5>getting powerful and well led who </v>
<v Speaker 5>otherwise would have been dealing with </v>

1277
01:15:57.351 --> 01:15:59.670
<v Speaker 5>the Ila Mites,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the elamites gets smashed by Asher,</v>

1278
01:15:59.671 --> 01:16:02.230
<v Speaker 5>Bonnie Paul in 6:46</v>
<v Speaker 5>BC.</v>

1279
01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:07.240
<v Speaker 5>He and the devastation is arguably </v>
<v Speaker 5>mortal.</v>

1280
01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:14.600
<v Speaker 5>We already mentioned a scene from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>aftermath of this isla might final </v>

1281
01:16:15.091 --> 01:16:20.091
<v Speaker 5>solution when Asha,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bonnie Paul's lying on his couch with </v>

1282
01:16:20.091 --> 01:16:21.660
<v Speaker 5>that woman there and then the severed </v>
<v Speaker 5>head,</v>

1283
01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:23.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>up on the pillar of their wall.</v>

1284
01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:24.610
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1285
01:16:24.810 --> 01:16:28.530
<v Speaker 5>part of the aftermath of dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the elamites this way.</v>

1286
01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:29.630
<v Speaker 5>Asha,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bonnie,</v>

1287
01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:31.650
<v Speaker 5>Paul Leeds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the greatest Syrian army,</v>

1288
01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:36.060
<v Speaker 5>all the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a long way again to susa devastates</v>

1289
01:16:36.061 --> 01:16:41.010
<v Speaker 5>elom as his scribe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>writing for himself recounts,</v>

1290
01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:44.940
<v Speaker 5>quote for a distance of one month in 25 </v>
<v Speaker 5>days.</v>

1291
01:16:44.941 --> 01:16:47.670
<v Speaker 5>March.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I devastated the districts of Ylem.</v>

1292
01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:51.720
<v Speaker 5>I spread salt and thorn Bush there to </v>
<v Speaker 5>injure the soil.</v>

1293
01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:56.960
<v Speaker 5>Sons of the king's sisters of the king's</v>
<v Speaker 5>members of royal family,</v>

1294
01:16:57.121 --> 01:17:01.200
<v Speaker 5>young and old prefix governors nights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Artisans,</v>

1295
01:17:01.201 --> 01:17:04.710
<v Speaker 5>as many as there were inhabited and male</v>
<v Speaker 5>and female,</v>

1296
01:17:04.711 --> 01:17:07.110
<v Speaker 5>big and little horses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mules,</v>

1297
01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:12.140
<v Speaker 5>asses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>flocks and herds more numerous than a </v>

1298
01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:14.120
<v Speaker 5>swarm of locusts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I carried them off as boody to Assyria,</v>

1299
01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:19.010
<v Speaker 5>the dust of Sousa of Murdoch to of how </v>
<v Speaker 5>and of the other cities.</v>

1300
01:17:19.011 --> 01:17:22.520
<v Speaker 5>I carried it off to a Syria in a month </v>
<v Speaker 5>of days.</v>

1301
01:17:22.521 --> 01:17:26.840
<v Speaker 5>I subdued elam in its whole extent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the voice of man,</v>

1302
01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.800
<v Speaker 5>the steps of flocks and herds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The happy shouts of Mirth.</v>

1303
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:34.730
<v Speaker 5>I put an end to them in its fields,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I left for the asses,</v>

1304
01:17:34.731 --> 01:17:39.731
<v Speaker 5>the gazelles and all manner of wild </v>
<v Speaker 5>beasts to people and quote.</v>

1305
01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:44.630
<v Speaker 5>The Assyrians were thorough.</v>

1306
01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:51.040
<v Speaker 5>They even removed the bones of the old </v>
<v Speaker 5>going back to ancient times.</v>

1307
01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:57.100
<v Speaker 5>Isla might rulers from their tombs and </v>
<v Speaker 5>took them back to a Siri with dilute my </v>

1308
01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:03.740
<v Speaker 5>story in a tea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Olmsted says they put them in </v>

1309
01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:05.420
<v Speaker 5>particularly awful spots so that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>would get no rest ever again,</v>

1310
01:18:05.421 --> 01:18:10.421
<v Speaker 5>laying in a foreign land and paying an </v>
<v Speaker 5>eternal price for their enmity to </v>

1311
01:18:10.770 --> 01:18:13.640
<v Speaker 5>Assyria.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That may have happened in the deep,</v>

1312
01:18:13.641 --> 01:18:16.770
<v Speaker 5>misty errors of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1313
01:18:16.771 --> 01:18:20.360
<v Speaker 5>we said to you earlier that the elamites</v>
<v Speaker 5>conquered the United States.</v>

1314
01:18:20.361 --> 01:18:23.840
<v Speaker 5>They take the statue of Liberty back as </v>
<v Speaker 5>a prize of war to be displayed.</v>

1315
01:18:24.710 --> 01:18:29.710
<v Speaker 5>Will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Assyrians wouldn't stop at the </v>

1316
01:18:29.710 --> 01:18:29.710
<v Speaker 5>Statue of Liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'd steal our constitution.</v>

1317
01:18:29.710 --> 01:18:34.331
<v Speaker 5>They take the Washington monument,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they sniff out the flame of John f </v>

1318
01:18:34.331 --> 01:18:36.260
<v Speaker 5>Kennedy's grave and take the bones with </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1319
01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:41.780
<v Speaker 5>The Assyrians were sort of setting the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bar for this region.</v>

1320
01:18:41.781 --> 01:18:44.750
<v Speaker 5>People like the Babylonians who come </v>
<v Speaker 5>afterwards will be just as brutal,</v>

1321
01:18:44.751 --> 01:18:47.690
<v Speaker 5>like they're trying to imitate whatever </v>
<v Speaker 5>the standard of the day is,</v>

1322
01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:52.220
<v Speaker 5>but the standard of the day is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even today,</v>

1323
01:18:52.450 --> 01:18:54.590
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>try making a movie out of it.</v>

1324
01:18:54.591 --> 01:18:55.590
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna.</v>

1325
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:59.270
<v Speaker 5>Be a cable one for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the story almost had tells of the</v>

1326
01:18:59.271 --> 01:19:01.130
<v Speaker 5>parade.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that a good word?</v>

1327
01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:02.250
<v Speaker 5>When Osher,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bonnie,</v>

1328
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:05.120
<v Speaker 5>Paul and his army arrived back home in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Nineveh,</v>

1329
01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:10.630
<v Speaker 5>displaying the loot and the prisoners </v>
<v Speaker 5>and meeting out punishment by the way to</v>

1330
01:19:10.881 --> 01:19:15.881
<v Speaker 5>all and sundry is frightful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

1331
01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:19.720
<v Speaker 5>the head of that elamite ruler that will</v>
<v Speaker 5>be sitting up on us.</v>

1332
01:19:19.730 --> 01:19:22.190
<v Speaker 5>You're bonded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Paul's wall or what have you,</v>

1333
01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:27.610
<v Speaker 5>was transported from Susa on foot around</v>
<v Speaker 5>the neck of the Ila might general </v>

1334
01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:33.720
<v Speaker 5>imagine how freaky that would have been </v>
<v Speaker 5>to live through who did the walking.</v>

1335
01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:38.800
<v Speaker 5>Shane's supposedly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then the various generals are </v>

1336
01:19:38.871 --> 01:19:43.871
<v Speaker 5>brought out and punished,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there's a psychological twists to a </v>

1337
01:19:43.871 --> 01:19:43.871
<v Speaker 5>Syrian punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

1338
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:47.990
<v Speaker 5>that is part of kind of what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Persians will sort of do away with.</v>

1339
01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:53.740
<v Speaker 5>Here's what 18 olmsted writes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm going to try my best at some of </v>

1340
01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:55.370
<v Speaker 5>the pronunciations of these Mesopotamian</v>
<v Speaker 5>names.</v>

<v Speaker 5>pulled out by the roots and were skinned</v>

1355
01:20:44.611 --> 01:20:47.550
<v Speaker 5>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The horrible scene is represented on one</v>

1356
01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:50.220
<v Speaker 5>of the reliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although strangely enough,</v>

1357
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:53.160
<v Speaker 5>olmsted writes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the names have never been filled in.</v>

1358
01:20:53.161 --> 01:20:58.161
<v Speaker 5>The blanks left for the purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The new new was placed on the rack and </v>

1359
01:20:58.161 --> 01:20:59.100
<v Speaker 5>slaughtered like a lamb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His brother,</v>

1360
01:20:59.101 --> 01:21:04.101
<v Speaker 5>Sam Guna,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when Appalachia were slain and their </v>

1361
01:21:04.101 --> 01:21:04.200
<v Speaker 5>flesh distributed among the surrounding </v>
<v Speaker 5>lands.</v>

1362
01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:07.280
<v Speaker 5>Now Bu naive and Bella tear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sons of Nablus,</v>

1363
01:21:07.290 --> 01:21:12.290
<v Speaker 5>Schumer were forced to crush the bones </v>
<v Speaker 5>of their father and the head of the Ila </v>

1364
01:21:12.290 --> 01:21:14.730
<v Speaker 5>Mike King found its final resting place </v>
<v Speaker 5>over the gate,</v>

1365
01:21:14.731 --> 01:21:19.731
<v Speaker 5>which led to assure and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>osher being a primary Assyrian city.</v>

1366
01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:25.880
<v Speaker 5>The forcing the sons to crush the bones </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the father is one of those really </v>

1367
01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:29.790
<v Speaker 5>psychologically horrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you'll see this in other occasions.</v>

1368
01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:31.770
<v Speaker 5>The Babylonian King,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1369
01:21:31.771 --> 01:21:36.771
<v Speaker 5>who supposedly once he took Jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>took the ruler the king and forced him </v>

1370
01:21:37.711 --> 01:21:42.390
<v Speaker 5>to watch the slaughtering of his two </v>
<v Speaker 5>young sons in front of his eyes and then</v>

1371
01:21:42.391 --> 01:21:45.270
<v Speaker 5>had his eyes put out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that the last thing he saw was that,</v>

1372
01:21:45.271 --> 01:21:50.271
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are the extra little cruelties </v>

1373
01:21:50.271 --> 01:21:50.271
<v Speaker 5>that just seem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1374
01:21:50.271 --> 01:21:54.441
<v Speaker 5>that just seemed calculated to subdue </v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody who's will to resist,</v>

1375
01:21:54.451 --> 01:21:58.020
<v Speaker 5>but you could easily see how it might </v>
<v Speaker 5>have the opposite effect.</v>

1376
01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.060
<v Speaker 5>You could see how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1377
01:22:00.061 --> 01:22:05.061
<v Speaker 5>people coming after this time might be </v>
<v Speaker 5>able to make all sorts of political hay </v>

1378
01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:11.250
<v Speaker 5>selling themselves as the alternative to</v>
<v Speaker 5>this kind of cruelty.</v>

1379
01:22:11.850 --> 01:22:16.740
<v Speaker 5>And you can also see why when a Syria </v>
<v Speaker 5>foul,</v>

1380
01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:21.750
<v Speaker 5>there were not a lot of tears cried for </v>
<v Speaker 5>what was gone.</v>

1381
01:22:21.751 --> 01:22:22.830
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1382
01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:25.710
<v Speaker 5>even the biblical prophets are </v>
<v Speaker 5>rejoicing.</v>

1383
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:33.610
<v Speaker 5>As I was trying to come up with some </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of analogy to try to define the </v>

1384
01:22:33.610 --> 01:22:38.171
<v Speaker 5>stakes here with what's about to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All I could think of in my uncreative </v>

1385
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:44.110
<v Speaker 5>mind was the idea of the United States </v>
<v Speaker 5>over the next five or so years.</v>

1386
01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.130
<v Speaker 5>Somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1387
01:22:46.131 --> 01:22:51.131
<v Speaker 5>with jaw dropping,</v>
<v Speaker 5>astonishing events fell apart or </v>

1388
01:22:51.921 --> 01:22:52.760
<v Speaker 5>imploded</v>

1389
01:22:54.010 --> 01:22:59.010
<v Speaker 5>and a broken to some kind of a civil war</v>
<v Speaker 5>ended up getting involved in maybe a </v>

1390
01:22:59.010 --> 01:22:59.350
<v Speaker 5>foreign war at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1391
01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.300
<v Speaker 5>he never know how these things are gonna</v>
<v Speaker 5>turn.</v>

1392
01:23:01.301 --> 01:23:05.380
<v Speaker 5>Remember how you felt if you were old </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough to remember what the 9:11</v>

1393
01:23:05.381 --> 01:23:06.190
<v Speaker 5>attacks look like</v>

1394
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.230
<v Speaker 2>on live television while you watched </v>
<v Speaker 2>them?</v>

1395
01:23:09.730 --> 01:23:12.550
<v Speaker 2>There's almost nothing positive that </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes out of something like that,</v>

1396
01:23:12.551 --> 01:23:16.780
<v Speaker 2>but one of the few things that was in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind was as you watched it,</v>

1397
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:22.350
<v Speaker 2>you were reminded that the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>astonishing things not only can happen </v>

1398
01:23:22.961 --> 01:23:25.030
<v Speaker 2>but will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like earthquakes.</v>

1399
01:23:25.031 --> 01:23:30.031
<v Speaker 2>You know there's going to be a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just don't know when you know </v>

1400
01:23:30.031 --> 01:23:32.500
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be some massive jaw </v>
<v Speaker 2>dropping historical event in the future.</v>

1401
01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:35.290
<v Speaker 2>You just don't know the date ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

1402
01:23:35.291 --> 01:23:37.450
<v Speaker 2>like a nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you watch that happening,</v>

1403
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:41.230
<v Speaker 2>that astonishment is how mankind has </v>
<v Speaker 2>failed over and over and over again.</v>

1404
01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:46.650
<v Speaker 2>As you look back on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's about to be an astonishing </v>

1405
01:23:46.650 --> 01:23:47.560
<v Speaker 2>moment in this story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really a moment,</v>

1406
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:52.210
<v Speaker 2>five to 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just appears astonishing now,</v>

1407
01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.330
<v Speaker 2>but it's akin to the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>imploding.</v>

1408
01:23:55.960 --> 01:24:00.960
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more than the Soviet Union </v>

1409
01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:00.960
<v Speaker 2>falling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a little less than the modern United</v>

1410
01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:01.930
<v Speaker 2>States going away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

1411
01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:04.600
<v Speaker 2>if the United States did go away in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next five years,</v>

1412
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:10.350
<v Speaker 2>what does the international situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>look like then mean what world instantly</v>

1413
01:24:11.801 --> 01:24:15.670
<v Speaker 2>springs up to replace such an important </v>
<v Speaker 2>cog and how does that go?</v>

1414
01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:22.080
<v Speaker 2>This is actually the world that is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to exist as soon as this story that must</v>

1415
01:24:23.681 --> 01:24:24.480
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1416
01:24:24.490 --> 01:24:26.560
<v Speaker 2>one of the great events in all human </v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

1417
01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:31.330
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know because we don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a [inaudible] there to give it even with</v>

1418
01:24:31.331 --> 01:24:36.331
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of lies and exaggerations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>untruths that may have filtered in over </v>

1419
01:24:36.331 --> 01:24:37.480
<v Speaker 2>the hundreds of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have his version or anyone like</v>

1420
01:24:37.481 --> 01:24:40.630
<v Speaker 2>him to explain it to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We liked the color.</v>

1421
01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:42.210
<v Speaker 2>I brought at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1422
01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:47.220
<v Speaker 2>promised he was going to tell this story</v>
<v Speaker 2>in one part of his histories and then </v>

1423
01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:49.930
<v Speaker 2>never did or didn't come down to us or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1424
01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:54.760
<v Speaker 2>Have a few tourists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Babylonian sources and that's it.</v>

1425
01:24:54.850 --> 01:24:59.850
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff you thought you could count </v>

1426
01:24:59.850 --> 01:24:59.850
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like those wonderful Assyrian,</v>

1427
01:24:59.850 --> 01:25:01.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pronouncements by the king of kings.</v>

1428
01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.100
<v Speaker 2>I went in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I planted thorn bushes.</v>

1429
01:25:03.101 --> 01:25:05.860
<v Speaker 2>I killed everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That ends in like 6:30,</v>

1430
01:25:05.861 --> 01:25:07.570
<v Speaker 2>nine bce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ominously,</v>

1431
01:25:07.571 --> 01:25:11.440
<v Speaker 2>and mysteriously all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the heck's going on?</v>

1432
01:25:12.490 --> 01:25:15.460
<v Speaker 2>I love the different ways that </v>
<v Speaker 2>historians try to describe this to.</v>

1433
01:25:15.461 --> 01:25:18.100
<v Speaker 2>One one historian says it was unclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>what was happening.</v>

1434
01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:23.740
<v Speaker 2>Author Mark Healey explained the </v>
<v Speaker 2>importance though of this period silence</v>

1435
01:25:23.741 --> 01:25:28.741
<v Speaker 2>because he says quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is in the silence of those years </v>

1436
01:25:28.741 --> 01:25:29.770
<v Speaker 2>that is written the fate of the Assyrian</v>
<v Speaker 2>Empire,</v>

1437
01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:34.810
<v Speaker 2>and so the important stuff is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just don't know much of what it is.</v>

1438
01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Open to interpretation is how another </v>
<v Speaker 2>historian put it,</v>

1439
01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:42.650
<v Speaker 2>but here's what basically goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Osher,</v>

1440
01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:44.050
<v Speaker 2>bond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Paul's rain.</v>

1441
01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:46.840
<v Speaker 2>At the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start to see things fraying.</v>

1442
01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:52.280
<v Speaker 2>It begin to see places that were under a</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious control on the on the margins </v>

1443
01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:56.521
<v Speaker 2>break free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of historians think that it's </v>

1444
01:25:56.521 --> 01:25:59.911
<v Speaker 2>rather telling that all of a sudden you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can have these skiffy and tribes riding </v>

1445
01:25:59.911 --> 01:26:01.420
<v Speaker 2>rough now in areas where the Assyrians </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to keep them out.</v>

1446
01:26:01.421 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 2>It must mean that they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While no</v>

1447
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:09.130
<v Speaker 5>one is really paying a lot of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The medes are beginning to fuse sort of </v>

1448
01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:14.051
<v Speaker 5>ends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's unclear how they did this with </v>

1449
01:26:14.051 --> 01:26:14.051
<v Speaker 5>the elamites.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Civilization.</v>

1450
01:26:14.051 --> 01:26:15.200
<v Speaker 5>Could have been peaceful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>could been warlike,</v>

1451
01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:20.560
<v Speaker 5>could've been diplomatic marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's making both civilization </v>

1452
01:26:20.560 --> 01:26:22.500
<v Speaker 5>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Osher,</v>

1453
01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:27.140
<v Speaker 5>Bonnie Paul dies and his sons go to war </v>
<v Speaker 5>with each other.</v>

1454
01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:33.370
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not uncommon in Assyrian royal </v>

1455
01:26:33.370 --> 01:26:36.350
<v Speaker 5>succession,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is coming at a particularly bad</v>

1456
01:26:36.351 --> 01:26:41.030
<v Speaker 5>time because all of a sudden the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Babylonians are resurgent again.</v>

1457
01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:45.710
<v Speaker 5>They've got a new dynasty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've got an army that is modeled.</v>

1458
01:26:45.711 --> 01:26:46.140
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1459
01:26:46.190 --> 01:26:46.480
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1460
01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:50.060
<v Speaker 5>not as effective copy of the Assyrians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Assyrians copy,</v>

1461
01:26:50.061 --> 01:26:53.990
<v Speaker 5>the Babylonian civilization not quite as</v>
<v Speaker 5>well as the Babylonian original.</v>

1462
01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:56.540
<v Speaker 5>And the Babylonians copied the Assyrian </v>
<v Speaker 5>military.</v>

1463
01:26:56.541 --> 01:26:59.390
<v Speaker 5>Though it's not quite up to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>originals standards either,</v>

1464
01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:04.040
<v Speaker 5>but when you've been fighting one half </v>
<v Speaker 5>of your army against the other,</v>

1465
01:27:04.041 --> 01:27:05.900
<v Speaker 5>which is what the Assyrians were doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a civil war,</v>

1466
01:27:05.901 --> 01:27:07.180
<v Speaker 5>that's why they're so ruinous.</v>

1467
01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:09.980
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have outside powers starting to loom</v>

1468
01:27:09.981 --> 01:27:11.660
<v Speaker 5>over you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what do you do with your army?</v>

1469
01:27:11.661 --> 01:27:13.880
<v Speaker 5>You divide it in half and fight it </v>
<v Speaker 5>against each other.</v>

1470
01:27:14.150 --> 01:27:19.150
<v Speaker 5>Worse possible thing that could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the Babylonians starting in </v>

1471
01:27:19.150 --> 01:27:21.770
<v Speaker 5>about 6:16,</v>
<v Speaker 5>start sending out an army,</v>

1472
01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:26.780
<v Speaker 5>taking some of these border cities </v>
<v Speaker 5>between Assyria and Babylon,</v>

1473
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:29.990
<v Speaker 5>and then the war heats up a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 5>in there fighting back and forth,</v>

1474
01:27:29.991 --> 01:27:32.960
<v Speaker 5>and the Assyrian Army seems to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>shadow of its former self.</v>

1475
01:27:32.961 --> 01:27:37.961
<v Speaker 5>But you could see how strong it still is</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they're holding their own </v>

1476
01:27:37.961 --> 01:27:38.570
<v Speaker 5>against these Babylonians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pushing them back,</v>

1477
01:27:38.571 --> 01:27:42.680
<v Speaker 5>sometimes chasing them back sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's all they can handle.</v>

1478
01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:48.460
<v Speaker 5>And then in like six slash 15 bce,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the medes jump in from the east and the </v>

1479
01:27:50.301 --> 01:27:54.380
<v Speaker 5>north,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they start taking cities in the east.</v>

1480
01:27:55.610 --> 01:27:58.910
<v Speaker 5>The next year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the medes come forward under their king,</v>

1481
01:27:58.911 --> 01:28:02.250
<v Speaker 5>see accessories and advances on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1482
01:28:02.420 --> 01:28:04.610
<v Speaker 5>one of the capitals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nineveh,</v>

1483
01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:08.870
<v Speaker 5>they can't take it because Nineveh is </v>
<v Speaker 5>this massively fortified,</v>

1484
01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:14.230
<v Speaker 5>probably the most fortified city west of</v>
<v Speaker 5>China in this whole human history up to </v>

1485
01:28:14.661 --> 01:28:15.140
<v Speaker 5>this point.</v>

1486
01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:17.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just an incredible feat.</v>

1487
01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:21.050
<v Speaker 5>Human Marvel and it pushes these means </v>
<v Speaker 5>sideways.</v>

1488
01:28:21.051 --> 01:28:24.980
<v Speaker 5>They just can't deal with it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But unfortunately for the Assyrians,</v>

1489
01:28:24.981 --> 01:28:27.560
<v Speaker 5>if you can't go out there and defeat </v>
<v Speaker 5>that muddy and army,</v>

1490
01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:32.980
<v Speaker 5>they can do whatever they want so they </v>
<v Speaker 5>go sack in nearby city that's not as </v>

1491
01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:34.970
<v Speaker 5>well defended.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just happens to be one of the great,</v>

1492
01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:36.440
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once upon a time,</v>

1493
01:28:36.441 --> 01:28:41.441
<v Speaker 5>a Syrian capitals vital,</v>
<v Speaker 5>connected to their religion and their </v>

1494
01:28:41.441 --> 01:28:44.090
<v Speaker 5>God and and morale and everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a big deal.</v>

1495
01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:50.380
<v Speaker 5>At the last minute,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Babylonians run up to be a part of </v>

1496
01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:50.380
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a famous event.</v>

1497
01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:50.380
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1498
01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:54.440
<v Speaker 5>they don't want to allow the media to </v>
<v Speaker 5>take this important city by themselves,</v>

1499
01:28:54.441 --> 01:28:56.540
<v Speaker 5>be left out of the spoils,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reputation,</v>

1500
01:28:56.541 --> 01:29:01.541
<v Speaker 5>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they arrived too late with their </v>

1501
01:29:01.541 --> 01:29:01.680
<v Speaker 5>army.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The means of already the place,</v>

1502
01:29:01.681 --> 01:29:02.220
<v Speaker 5>maybe</v>

1503
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:05.610
<v Speaker 2>rushing the attempt so that they'd beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Babylonians mayor.</v>

1504
01:29:06.210 --> 01:29:08.370
<v Speaker 2>They treated the way the Assyrians would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have treated it,</v>

1505
01:29:08.371 --> 01:29:13.371
<v Speaker 2>and it's a horrific event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Babylonian King and the Medean king </v>

1506
01:29:15.930 --> 01:29:20.930
<v Speaker 2>pledged their friendship to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As osher burns in the background and the</v>

1507
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:25.560
<v Speaker 2>killing continues in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the slaves are being dragged off and all</v>

1508
01:29:25.561 --> 01:29:30.561
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden a week into Syria has </v>
<v Speaker 2>Babylon and the medes working together </v>

1509
01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:37.110
<v Speaker 2>and advancing on Nineveh in six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 bcee.</v>

1510
01:29:38.970 --> 01:29:42.330
<v Speaker 2>If this wasn't bad enough at the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>

1511
01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:47.360
<v Speaker 2>allegedly not everybody says this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the standard belief is at the last </v>

1512
01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:48.670
<v Speaker 2>minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a horde of skiff,</v>

1513
01:29:48.671 --> 01:29:53.671
<v Speaker 2>Ian's in a rides in the wild northern </v>
<v Speaker 2>horsemen and joins both the medes and </v>

1514
01:29:55.021 --> 01:30:00.021
<v Speaker 2>the Babylonians in this last assault </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon this greatest of West Asian </v>

1515
01:30:01.410 --> 01:30:06.090
<v Speaker 2>military fortresses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and together they take it down,</v>

1516
01:30:07.890 --> 01:30:10.440
<v Speaker 2>had to fight three battles on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plains,</v>

1517
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:14.520
<v Speaker 2>supposedly before they even got a chance</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get near the walls with this last old</v>

1518
01:30:14.521 --> 01:30:18.180
<v Speaker 2>aging damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lion of a serious swatting them away and</v>

1519
01:30:18.181 --> 01:30:20.820
<v Speaker 2>fighting well as long as they could</v>

1520
01:30:22.330 --> 01:30:27.330
<v Speaker 2>the Babylonian king in the terse style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that those people wrote in,</v>

1521
01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:32.110
<v Speaker 2>described what he did to what he calls </v>
<v Speaker 2>the land of [inaudible],</v>

1522
01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:35.230
<v Speaker 2>which is their word for Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

1523
01:30:35.231 --> 01:30:39.670
<v Speaker 2>notice how he's couching this in terms </v>
<v Speaker 2>of liberation from the,</v>

1524
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:41.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Syrian yoke.</v>

1525
01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:42.010
<v Speaker 2>The record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1526
01:30:42.011 --> 01:30:45.190
<v Speaker 2>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I slaughtered the land of [inaudible].</v>

1527
01:30:45.370 --> 01:30:50.370
<v Speaker 2>I turned the hostile land into heaps and</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruins the Assyrian who since distant </v>

1528
01:30:50.591 --> 01:30:55.591
<v Speaker 2>days had ruled over all the peoples and </v>
<v Speaker 2>with his heavy yoke brought injury to </v>

1529
01:30:55.591 --> 01:30:57.940
<v Speaker 2>the people of the land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his feet from a cod.</v>

1530
01:30:57.941 --> 01:31:02.110
<v Speaker 2>I turned back his yoke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I threw off and quote,</v>

1531
01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:08.640
<v Speaker 2>and you have a basic problem when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when discussing events of the past like </v>

1532
01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:12.661
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're discussing something from </v>

1533
01:31:12.661 --> 01:31:12.661
<v Speaker 2>recent history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say the end of the third,</v>

1534
01:31:12.661 --> 01:31:14.110
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit the second world war,</v>

1535
01:31:14.410 --> 01:31:17.140
<v Speaker 2>all that emotion is still felt right.</v>

1536
01:31:17.140 --> 01:31:20.620
<v Speaker 2>You get a real feel for the kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things historians don't want to touch.</v>

1537
01:31:20.621 --> 01:31:25.621
<v Speaker 2>Once you get back a certain distance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some day they're not going to look at </v>

1538
01:31:25.621 --> 01:31:28.360
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis as the kind of evil that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1539
01:31:28.810 --> 01:31:31.570
<v Speaker 2>They're going to somehow say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1540
01:31:31.571 --> 01:31:35.590
<v Speaker 2>they were on the far end of the spectrum</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what people did then,</v>

1541
01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:38.830
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of what a lot of modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones would say about a Syria.</v>

1542
01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:42.160
<v Speaker 2>They're not doing anything anybody else </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't doing.</v>

1543
01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:45.460
<v Speaker 2>They just may be at the far end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum of,</v>

1544
01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:46.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conduct.</v>

1545
01:31:47.980 --> 01:31:49.540
<v Speaker 2>It's all kind of relative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1546
01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:55.620
<v Speaker 2>but you could certainly see the anger </v>
<v Speaker 2>and vengeance in the people that goes </v>

1547
01:31:56.981 --> 01:31:58.340
<v Speaker 2>beyond mere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1548
01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.070
<v Speaker 2>the taking of and slaves</v>

1549
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:03.040
<v Speaker 5>and the things that have motivated </v>
<v Speaker 5>soldiers sometimes in the heat of battle</v>

1550
01:32:03.041 --> 01:32:07.090
<v Speaker 5>at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This involved some payback</v>

1551
01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:09.570
<v Speaker 5>story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mark Vandy,</v>

1552
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:14.590
<v Speaker 5>Maru explains that you can still see at </v>
<v Speaker 5>vengeance today mean there's an eternal </v>

1553
01:32:15.501 --> 01:32:18.230
<v Speaker 5>bit of payback that was done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He writes,</v>

1554
01:32:18.231 --> 01:32:23.231
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the conquerors set out to destroy the </v>

1555
01:32:23.231 --> 01:32:25.220
<v Speaker 5>cities of Assyria,</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking revenge for the humiliations they</v>

1556
01:32:25.221 --> 01:32:28.700
<v Speaker 5>had suffered a serious hands on wall </v>
<v Speaker 5>reliefs of kings,</v>

1557
01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:31.250
<v Speaker 5>Senaca Reeb and Asher,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bonnie Paul in Nineveh,</v>

1558
01:32:31.251 --> 01:32:36.251
<v Speaker 5>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They identified the representations of </v>

1559
01:32:36.251 --> 01:32:38.540
<v Speaker 5>the kings with the help of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>inscriptions accompany them and ritually</v>

1560
01:32:38.541 --> 01:32:41.630
<v Speaker 5>destroyed them by cutting out the ears </v>
<v Speaker 5>and eyes.</v>

1561
01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:46.710
<v Speaker 5>These were not random acts of mutilation</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the detailed depiction of Asha Bonnie</v>

1562
01:32:46.710 --> 01:32:48.470
<v Speaker 5>Paul's defeated the Elamites,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

1563
01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:53.680
<v Speaker 5>only the face of a soldier cutting off </v>
<v Speaker 5>the head of the king of Ilan was </v>

1564
01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:57.281
<v Speaker 5>similarly destroyed probably by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>medes who saw the elamites as their </v>

1565
01:32:57.281 --> 01:32:58.400
<v Speaker 5>ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Likewise,</v>

1566
01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:03.520
<v Speaker 5>the records of loyalty oaths that King </v>
<v Speaker 5>Esr had on had forced Medea and body </v>

1567
01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:07.280
<v Speaker 5>guards to swear and which had been </v>
<v Speaker 5>stored at cal who were smashed.</v>

1568
01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:12.520
<v Speaker 5>The palaces were burnt down only after </v>
<v Speaker 5>the lengthy task of defacing images and </v>

1569
01:33:12.591 --> 01:33:17.270
<v Speaker 5>destroying symbols of submission to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>Syria had been completed and quote.</v>

1570
01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:22.140
<v Speaker 5>If you go to the British Museum today </v>
<v Speaker 5>and look at the Assyrian reliefs,</v>

1571
01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:27.210
<v Speaker 5>you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the defacing done by some angry</v>

1572
01:33:27.211 --> 01:33:32.211
<v Speaker 5>vengeful and probably rightfully so </v>
<v Speaker 5>soldier as they took down with Syria </v>

1573
01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:37.940
<v Speaker 5>piece by piece,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but stunningly quickly by historical </v>

1574
01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:37.940
<v Speaker 5>standards.</v>

1575
01:33:38.190 --> 01:33:42.150
<v Speaker 5>And while there may be no hurghada tests</v>
<v Speaker 5>to give color to this story,</v>

1576
01:33:42.750 --> 01:33:46.530
<v Speaker 5>there is one of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess for military history fans,</v>

1577
01:33:46.770 --> 01:33:51.770
<v Speaker 5>one of the most colorful sections of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Old Testament of the Bible that deals </v>

1578
01:33:51.770 --> 01:33:56.180
<v Speaker 5>with the fall of the Syria and I'm sure </v>
<v Speaker 5>a Syrian descendants and people who are </v>

1579
01:33:56.180 --> 01:34:00.900
<v Speaker 5>big Assyrian fans think this is very </v>
<v Speaker 5>unfair sort of propaganda.</v>

1580
01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:03.780
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just they're bad luck to get bad pr</v>

1581
01:34:03.781 --> 01:34:08.781
<v Speaker 5>sometimes in the Bible and the biblical </v>
<v Speaker 5>Prophet Niamh was prophesizing </v>

1582
01:34:08.781 --> 01:34:11.760
<v Speaker 5>supposedly that you're going to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then once they did get it,</v>

1583
01:34:11.761 --> 01:34:13.050
<v Speaker 5>he was sort of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>see,</v>

1584
01:34:13.051 --> 01:34:18.051
<v Speaker 5>this is what you get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now what's kind of interesting about </v>

1585
01:34:18.051 --> 01:34:18.051
<v Speaker 5>nay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unlike some of these other prophets,</v>

1586
01:34:18.051 --> 01:34:22.521
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a decent chance he was a </v>

1587
01:34:22.521 --> 01:34:24.441
<v Speaker 5>contemporary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of this stuff was put together in </v>

1588
01:34:24.441 --> 01:34:24.480
<v Speaker 5>the hellenistic period later,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1589
01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:27.810
<v Speaker 5>from earlier stories are all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 5>things dealing with that era.</v>

1590
01:34:28.110 --> 01:34:31.800
<v Speaker 5>But some of this goes back and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>tough to know and historians argue,</v>

1591
01:34:31.801 --> 01:34:36.801
<v Speaker 5>but it's possible that this prophet </v>
<v Speaker 5>named guy was maybe even a predecessor </v>

1592
01:34:36.810 --> 01:34:38.370
<v Speaker 5>to some of these events.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So who knows,</v>

1593
01:34:38.371 --> 01:34:39.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I won't get into something like that.</v>

1594
01:34:39.871 --> 01:34:43.590
<v Speaker 5>I just found it interesting because when</v>
<v Speaker 5>he recounts what happens,</v>

1595
01:34:43.591 --> 01:34:48.591
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he gives you the color and tells you a </v>

1596
01:34:48.591 --> 01:34:49.500
<v Speaker 5>little bit about the story in a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a religious sort of framework.</v>

1597
01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:52.380
<v Speaker 5>Still doesn't sound like Hurghada just </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a religious tone to it.</v>

1598
01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:56.220
<v Speaker 5>But at the same time it's very colorful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he describes,</v>

1599
01:34:56.221 --> 01:35:01.221
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what the battle is like after </v>

1600
01:35:01.221 --> 01:35:04.091
<v Speaker 5>prophesizing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you're going to get it for a long </v>

1601
01:35:04.091 --> 01:35:04.091
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he says,</v>

1602
01:35:04.091 --> 01:35:06.761
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he that shatters in pieces has come up </v>

1603
01:35:06.761 --> 01:35:10.181
<v Speaker 5>against the guard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wall guard the way good thy loins </v>

1604
01:35:10.181 --> 01:35:11.480
<v Speaker 5>make dice strength,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the utmost.</v>

1605
01:35:11.690 --> 01:35:15.950
<v Speaker 5>The Shield of his heroes is red.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His warriors are colliding scarlet.</v>

1606
01:35:16.190 --> 01:35:19.850
<v Speaker 5>They prepare the chariots today that </v>
<v Speaker 5>cherry had horses are eager.</v>

1607
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:21.950
<v Speaker 5>The Cherry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's rage in the field.</v>

1608
01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:27.100
<v Speaker 5>They rushed to and fro in the plazas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their appearance is like that of </v>

1609
01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:28.910
<v Speaker 5>torches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They dart about like lightning's.</v>

1610
01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:32.210
<v Speaker 5>He reads out the list of his nobles in </v>
<v Speaker 5>their eagerness.</v>

1611
01:35:32.211 --> 01:35:34.790
<v Speaker 5>They stumble,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they hastened to reach the walls.</v>

1612
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:39.640
<v Speaker 5>The battering ram is made ready.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they,</v>

1613
01:35:39.641 --> 01:35:42.980
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>describes the unleashing of the rivers.</v>

1614
01:35:42.981 --> 01:35:47.720
<v Speaker 5>I guess the dams were broken or rerouted</v>
<v Speaker 5>or they reroute the course of the rivers</v>

1615
01:35:47.721 --> 01:35:49.520
<v Speaker 5>or what have you to help undermine the </v>
<v Speaker 5>walls.</v>

1616
01:35:49.521 --> 01:35:52.820
<v Speaker 5>That's not that unusual a tactic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But with a big city like this,</v>

1617
01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:57.050
<v Speaker 5>not a small engineering feat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the prophet named says,</v>

1618
01:35:57.051 --> 01:36:00.170
<v Speaker 5>quote the reverse sluices or opened the </v>
<v Speaker 5>palace,</v>

1619
01:36:00.171 --> 01:36:03.410
<v Speaker 5>walls are crumbling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Queen is stripped of her clothing.</v>

1620
01:36:03.530 --> 01:36:05.360
<v Speaker 5>They are leading her away captive.</v>

1621
01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:09.050
<v Speaker 5>Her handmaidens Moan like doves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>upon their breasts,</v>

1622
01:36:09.051 --> 01:36:12.590
<v Speaker 5>they are beating Nineveh was a tank of </v>
<v Speaker 5>water from it.</v>

1623
01:36:12.591 --> 01:36:15.440
<v Speaker 5>They are now escaping stand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stand.</v>

1624
01:36:15.441 --> 01:36:20.441
<v Speaker 5>They cry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not one of them looks backward and then </v>

1625
01:36:20.441 --> 01:36:24.521
<v Speaker 5>he basically tells everybody to take </v>
<v Speaker 5>back the stuff that a Syria took from </v>

1626
01:36:24.521 --> 01:36:27.320
<v Speaker 5>them and that their housing in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>immensely wealthy city.</v>

1627
01:36:27.321 --> 01:36:28.100
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

1628
01:36:28.370 --> 01:36:32.150
<v Speaker 5>take either spoil of silver,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take either spoil of gold.</v>

1629
01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:36.470
<v Speaker 5>There is no end to the store and </v>
<v Speaker 5>abundance of all goodly objects.</v>

1630
01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:39.830
<v Speaker 5>She is empty and void and waste hearts </v>
<v Speaker 5>melt,</v>

1631
01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:43.370
<v Speaker 5>knees shake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is pain in all loins and Pale.</v>

1632
01:36:43.371 --> 01:36:48.371
<v Speaker 5>Have waxed all the faces and then he </v>
<v Speaker 5>does a little trash talk,</v>

1633
01:36:49.401 --> 01:36:50.800
<v Speaker 5>gloating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1634
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:51.680
<v Speaker 5>where he says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where are the,</v>

1635
01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:56.720
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>great lions now and all the people who </v>

1636
01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:57.620
<v Speaker 5>took all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then like again,</v>

1637
01:36:57.621 --> 01:37:01.190
<v Speaker 5>so many of the people during this era,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this was seen to involve,</v>

1638
01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:06.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little proof that their God was </v>

1639
01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:06.640
<v Speaker 5>superior.</v>

1640
01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:09.440
<v Speaker 5>Or in the case of some of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by this point in history,</v>

1641
01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:14.500
<v Speaker 5>the only God a name says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>behold I am against thee,</v>

1642
01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:19.250
<v Speaker 5>says y'all way of hosts that I layer I </v>
<v Speaker 5>will burn with smoke.</v>

1643
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:21.590
<v Speaker 5>They're young.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The sword shall devour.</v>

1644
01:37:21.650 --> 01:37:22.640
<v Speaker 5>I will cut off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>die,</v>

1645
01:37:22.650 --> 01:37:24.800
<v Speaker 5>pray from the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No more be heard.</v>

1646
01:37:24.801 --> 01:37:29.801
<v Speaker 5>They messengers voices and he continues </v>
<v Speaker 5>to rub it in and basically blame this on</v>

1647
01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:36.850
<v Speaker 5>Karma if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Woe to the bloody city full of lies and </v>

1648
01:37:37.071 --> 01:37:39.950
<v Speaker 5>robbery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the crack of the whip and the thunder of</v>

1649
01:37:39.951 --> 01:37:44.951
<v Speaker 5>the rumbling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll the prancing horse and the </v>

1650
01:37:44.951 --> 01:37:47.381
<v Speaker 5>bounding chariot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the horseman mounting and the flash of </v>

1651
01:37:47.381 --> 01:37:49.970
<v Speaker 5>stored the gleam of spear and a massive </v>
<v Speaker 5>slain a heap of corpses.</v>

1652
01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:55.060
<v Speaker 5>There are no end to the dead bodies for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the many infidelities of the well </v>

1653
01:37:55.060 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 5>favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the</v>

1654
01:37:56.010 --> 01:38:01.010
<v Speaker 2>mistress of incantations who sold states</v>
<v Speaker 2>for her wicked deeds and clans through </v>

1655
01:38:01.981 --> 01:38:04.230
<v Speaker 2>her incantations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Behold say,</v>

1656
01:38:04.231 --> 01:38:06.780
<v Speaker 2>if the outweigh of host I am against </v>
<v Speaker 2>thee,</v>

1657
01:38:06.930 --> 01:38:11.780
<v Speaker 2>I will strip the UAE clothing and show </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I shamed the nation's filth.</v>

1658
01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:16.470
<v Speaker 2>I will cast upon thee and disgraced the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will set the up as a warning.</v>

1659
01:38:16.710 --> 01:38:21.000
<v Speaker 2>All who see the shall flee shall cry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>desolate Nineveh,</v>

1660
01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:26.120
<v Speaker 2>who shall be whale her end quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well listen,</v>

1661
01:38:26.271 --> 01:38:31.271
<v Speaker 2>they may not have a ton of dramatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff from the Near East during this </v>

1662
01:38:31.271 --> 01:38:32.900
<v Speaker 2>time period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's awesome.</v>

1663
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:37.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean all history aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome stuff and it does give </v>

1664
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:40.190
<v Speaker 2>you a feel for the emotion of the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

1665
01:38:40.191 --> 01:38:42.950
<v Speaker 2>We may think you know that it's all been</v>
<v Speaker 2>drained,</v>

1666
01:38:42.951 --> 01:38:47.951
<v Speaker 2>but that's somebody who is clearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking that is Syria is reaping what </v>

1667
01:38:48.381 --> 01:38:50.730
<v Speaker 2>she sewed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1668
01:38:50.731 --> 01:38:55.710
<v Speaker 2>I pity the poor Syrian people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to live with one piece of horrible pr,</v>

1669
01:38:55.711 --> 01:39:00.711
<v Speaker 2>making it down through the errors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most widely read book in history in </v>

1670
01:39:00.711 --> 01:39:02.250
<v Speaker 2>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get some negative pr in it.</v>

1671
01:39:03.570 --> 01:39:07.680
<v Speaker 2>The last two Syrian king is rumored is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>good way to put it.</v>

1672
01:39:08.070 --> 01:39:13.070
<v Speaker 2>There's not enough information to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this is rumored to have as the enemy </v>

1673
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:17.721
<v Speaker 2>was closing in pile all of his worldly </v>
<v Speaker 2>possessions that were in his palace </v>

1674
01:39:18.151 --> 01:39:23.151
<v Speaker 2>around him and the gold and the silver </v>
<v Speaker 2>and have family members killed and unix </v>

1675
01:39:23.151 --> 01:39:23.940
<v Speaker 2>and concubines thrown on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1676
01:39:23.941 --> 01:39:24.410
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1677
01:39:24.430 --> 01:39:29.430
<v Speaker 2>the pile of stuff with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then have it all set a light with </v>

1678
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:30.900
<v Speaker 2>him sitting in the middle of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a scene like that in the Lord of</v>

1679
01:39:30.901 --> 01:39:32.880
<v Speaker 2>the rings to apparently in this time </v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

1680
01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:38.240
<v Speaker 2>It happened a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably it was a Motif they certainly </v>

1681
01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:41.631
<v Speaker 2>referred back to for a short time and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Siri and successors state.</v>

1682
01:39:42.681 --> 01:39:45.920
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you could call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you could call it the last gasp of</v>

1683
01:39:45.921 --> 01:39:47.810
<v Speaker 2>resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tried to make a stand,</v>

1684
01:39:47.811 --> 01:39:48.470
<v Speaker 2>but by six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1685
01:39:48.471 --> 01:39:53.471
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was destroyed to and the Assyrians </v>

1686
01:39:53.471 --> 01:39:55.190
<v Speaker 2>will turn into a people that never </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappeared,</v>

1687
01:39:55.910 --> 01:40:00.910
<v Speaker 2>but who's destruction was so massive and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so sustained and so total that they seem</v>

1688
01:40:01.761 --> 01:40:02.450
<v Speaker 2>like they did.</v>

1689
01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:07.010
<v Speaker 2>You will hear a Syrians trying to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

1690
01:40:07.011 --> 01:40:12.011
<v Speaker 2>still today we're still here and try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight that idea that every last one of </v>

1691
01:40:12.011 --> 01:40:14.720
<v Speaker 2>them was killed in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their version of a holocaust.</v>

1692
01:40:14.721 --> 01:40:15.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of that era.</v>

1693
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not true,</v>

1694
01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:21.920
<v Speaker 2>but you could certainly say that within </v>
<v Speaker 2>a very short period of time,</v>

1695
01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:24.260
<v Speaker 2>those massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1696
01:40:24.290 --> 01:40:29.290
<v Speaker 2>top of their era cities and fortresses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're almost unrecognizable in a famous </v>

1697
01:40:31.461 --> 01:40:36.461
<v Speaker 2>passage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Greek General xenophon with his </v>

1698
01:40:36.461 --> 01:40:39.641
<v Speaker 2>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greeks fleeing a Persian civil war will </v>

1699
01:40:39.641 --> 01:40:42.410
<v Speaker 2>get chased all the way through what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>now northern Iraq.</v>

1700
01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:48.610
<v Speaker 2>He will come upon these great massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>cities by their standards of the day,</v>

1701
01:40:49.790 --> 01:40:50.990
<v Speaker 2>simply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1702
01:40:50.991 --> 01:40:53.740
<v Speaker 2>rotting in the dust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deserted,</v>

1703
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:59.950
<v Speaker 2>but the walls are so high and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>workmanship on the streets and </v>

1704
01:40:59.950 --> 01:41:04.841
<v Speaker 2>everything so modern that he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand where it came from.</v>

1705
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:07.580
<v Speaker 2>The locals don't know anything about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Syria.</v>

1706
01:41:07.581 --> 01:41:10.070
<v Speaker 2>They think the medes built it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

1707
01:41:10.090 --> 01:41:13.340
<v Speaker 2>within 200 years these cities are lying </v>
<v Speaker 2>in ruins,</v>

1708
01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:18.590
<v Speaker 2>are still larger than almost anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>new being built at that time and nobody </v>

1709
01:41:18.590 --> 01:41:23.471
<v Speaker 2>even remembers that they were a Syrian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The account by xenophon of these ghost </v>

1710
01:41:26.670 --> 01:41:27.870
<v Speaker 2>cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

1711
01:41:28.980 --> 01:41:33.980
<v Speaker 2>I've spoken about them before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the ultimate statue of liberty in </v>

1712
01:41:33.980 --> 01:41:38.091
<v Speaker 2>the sand sort of historical moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean when I say that </v>

1713
01:41:38.091 --> 01:41:38.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The end of the planet,</v>

1714
01:41:38.221 --> 01:41:43.221
<v Speaker 2>of the apes where Charlton Heston </v>
<v Speaker 2>believes he's been on a distant planet </v>

1715
01:41:43.221 --> 01:41:43.680
<v Speaker 2>the whole time and the very last scene </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the movie,</v>

1716
01:41:43.950 --> 01:41:46.030
<v Speaker 2>he looks into the distance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1717
01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:51.040
<v Speaker 2>with the surf crashing against it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sees the statue of Liberty three </v>

1718
01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.530
<v Speaker 2>quarters buried in the sand.</v>

1719
01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:58.230
<v Speaker 2>If you could take an Assyrian individual</v>
<v Speaker 2>from three,</v>

1720
01:41:58.231 --> 01:42:03.231
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>500 years before xenophon lived and </v>

1721
01:42:03.231 --> 01:42:07.401
<v Speaker 2>bring him forward or her forward in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>time machine so that she could hang out </v>

1722
01:42:07.401 --> 01:42:08.120
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1723
01:42:08.190 --> 01:42:12.830
<v Speaker 2>by the ruins of Nineveh with xenophon </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what,</v>

1724
01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:14.310
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were run through her head,</v>

1725
01:42:14.311 --> 01:42:19.311
<v Speaker 2>what would run through your head if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could go forward in a time machine and </v>

1726
01:42:19.311 --> 01:42:20.880
<v Speaker 2>see our ghost cities someday.</v>

1727
01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:24.770
<v Speaker 2>And I marveled at the size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean 200 years later,</v>

1728
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:27.680
<v Speaker 2>xenophon says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he can't really lie.</v>

1729
01:42:27.681 --> 01:42:29.880
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people who know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1730
01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:33.380
<v Speaker 2>what xenophon's talking about here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have seen it and could call him a liar.</v>

1731
01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:35.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean he says the base of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fortification,</v>

1732
01:42:35.961 --> 01:42:40.961
<v Speaker 2>he's camping bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fifty feet broad and 50 feet high and </v>

1733
01:42:40.961 --> 01:42:45.821
<v Speaker 2>then has a brick wall 50 feet broad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And another hundred feet high on top of </v>

1734
01:42:47.451 --> 01:42:52.451
<v Speaker 2>that and the circumference of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fortifications is 18 miles.</v>

1735
01:42:54.110 --> 01:42:55.760
<v Speaker 2>He says there are some people sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1736
01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:01.000
<v Speaker 2>little like refugees and small villages </v>
<v Speaker 2>and semi-nomadic groups of people </v>

1737
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.831
<v Speaker 2>camping by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that city used to have hundreds of </v>

1738
01:43:05.831 --> 01:43:08.600
<v Speaker 2>thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a million people living there.</v>

1739
01:43:09.710 --> 01:43:14.710
<v Speaker 2>That's a ghost city from a dead era by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the times and uh,</v>

1740
01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:20.180
<v Speaker 2>funds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're only a couple of hundred years </v>

1741
01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:20.180
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when a series of falls,</v>

1742
01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:22.550
<v Speaker 2>it's like that moment we spoke about </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>

1743
01:43:22.551 --> 01:43:26.390
<v Speaker 2>what would happen if the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappeared in five or 15 years?</v>

1744
01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:29.270
<v Speaker 2>What's the world then look like without </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1745
01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:34.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>senator spoke of the wagon wheel </v>

1746
01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:36.581
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard even to think for people born </v>

1747
01:43:36.581 --> 01:43:39.191
<v Speaker 2>in the last 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years maybe of any other sort of </v>

1748
01:43:39.191 --> 01:43:41.570
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's the case for the people who</v>

1749
01:43:41.571 --> 01:43:44.090
<v Speaker 2>lived through it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they were blinking and just waking</v>

1750
01:43:44.091 --> 01:43:49.091
<v Speaker 2>up to a new day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really does have sort of an end of </v>

1751
01:43:49.091 --> 01:43:52.001
<v Speaker 2>the Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to feel like everything's been </v>

1752
01:43:52.001 --> 01:43:52.250
<v Speaker 2>devastated in whole bunch of people</v>

1753
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:57.250
<v Speaker 5>who had allied together for this common </v>
<v Speaker 5>interest of taking down the Assyrian </v>

1754
01:43:57.770 --> 01:44:02.770
<v Speaker 5>Empire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're now staring over the rubble </v>

1755
01:44:02.770 --> 01:44:02.770
<v Speaker 5>wondering who gets what and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>sudden,</v>

1756
01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:06.920
<v Speaker 5>like in 1946 in a Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially,</v>

1757
01:44:06.921 --> 01:44:10.370
<v Speaker 5>allies were turning into potential </v>
<v Speaker 5>adversaries very quickly.</v>

1758
01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:16.420
<v Speaker 5>There were four know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If we look at this as a encapsulated </v>

1759
01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:18.620
<v Speaker 5>little micro world here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>geopolitically speaking,</v>

1760
01:44:18.621 --> 01:44:23.621
<v Speaker 5>which is how I look at these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sorry for all you folks who'd like a </v>

1761
01:44:23.621 --> 01:44:26.360
<v Speaker 5>little bit more culture or religion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nonetheless in this geopolitical setup,</v>

1762
01:44:26.361 --> 01:44:28.820
<v Speaker 5>we really have four great powers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you go from one,</v>

1763
01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:31.250
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hegemonic power,</v>

1764
01:44:31.310 --> 01:44:35.390
<v Speaker 5>Syria to Babylon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>picking up a lot of,</v>

1765
01:44:35.391 --> 01:44:37.430
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Syrian territory in this whole deal.</v>

1766
01:44:37.490 --> 01:44:42.490
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll also have the medes obviously </v>

1767
01:44:42.490 --> 01:44:42.490
<v Speaker 5>doing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1768
01:44:42.490 --> 01:44:44.540
<v Speaker 5>moving into territory in the north of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Syria,</v>

1769
01:44:44.541 --> 01:44:49.541
<v Speaker 5>owned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have Egypt always a great power if </v>

1770
01:44:49.541 --> 01:44:51.140
<v Speaker 5>they can be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not that long ago,</v>

1771
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:56.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>under Syrian domination like everyone </v>

1772
01:44:56.350 --> 01:44:56.630
<v Speaker 5>else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they start moving towards the modern day</v>

1773
01:44:56.750 --> 01:44:59.930
<v Speaker 5>area around Israel and in there.</v>

1774
01:44:59.930 --> 01:45:02.300
<v Speaker 5>And they are a player.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And finally,</v>

1775
01:45:02.301 --> 01:45:07.301
<v Speaker 5>if at fourth power called Lydia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lydia is the power that's now in modern </v>

1776
01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:11.600
<v Speaker 5>day Turkey for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like everyone else,</v>

1777
01:45:11.601 --> 01:45:13.790
<v Speaker 5>they benefited from the Assyrians going </v>
<v Speaker 5>away.</v>

1778
01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:16.550
<v Speaker 5>They were able to move and expand into </v>
<v Speaker 5>other areas.</v>

1779
01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:22.120
<v Speaker 5>They are generally credited with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>one's inventing metal money at least in </v>

1780
01:45:23.841 --> 01:45:28.841
<v Speaker 5>the western world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you will begin to see at least in </v>

1781
01:45:29.061 --> 01:45:34.061
<v Speaker 5>the longterm view of things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all sorts of conflicts breaking out now </v>

1782
01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:38.180
<v Speaker 5>as all these new powers sort of vie with</v>
<v Speaker 5>each other.</v>

1783
01:45:39.230 --> 01:45:41.420
<v Speaker 5>The Egyptians and the Babylonians for </v>
<v Speaker 5>example,</v>

1784
01:45:41.421 --> 01:45:42.710
<v Speaker 5>we'll go at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1785
01:45:42.740 --> 01:45:44.630
<v Speaker 5>several times trying to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1786
01:45:44.690 --> 01:45:47.180
<v Speaker 5>is anybody gonna Conquer anybody?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where's the border going to be?</v>

1787
01:45:47.181 --> 01:45:51.020
<v Speaker 5>And all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of the littler states just get</v>

1788
01:45:51.021 --> 01:45:56.021
<v Speaker 5>totally screwed in this deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a little like the cold war where </v>

1789
01:45:56.021 --> 01:45:59.951
<v Speaker 5>some states in the middle try to decide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do I side with the Soviets or do I side </v>

1790
01:45:59.951 --> 01:45:59.951
<v Speaker 5>with the Western?</v>

1791
01:45:59.951 --> 01:46:02.660
<v Speaker 5>And then if you screw up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all kinds of bad things can happen.</v>

1792
01:46:02.661 --> 01:46:05.210
<v Speaker 5>That's exactly what happened to poor </v>
<v Speaker 5>Judah.</v>

1793
01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:10.870
<v Speaker 5>That was sacked by the Babylonian King.</v>
<v Speaker 5>During this era for continually swaying </v>

1794
01:46:12.441 --> 01:46:15.560
<v Speaker 5>sort of between the two powers that were</v>
<v Speaker 5>vying for them,</v>

1795
01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:17.780
<v Speaker 5>Babylon on one side and Egypt on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other,</v>

1796
01:46:18.260 --> 01:46:22.490
<v Speaker 5>and finally exasperating the Babylonian </v>
<v Speaker 5>king to the breaking point.</v>

1797
01:46:24.110 --> 01:46:29.110
<v Speaker 5>There are Jews in Iraq today whose </v>
<v Speaker 5>ancestors were a part of the Babylonian </v>

1798
01:46:30.561 --> 01:46:31.790
<v Speaker 5>King,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1799
01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:34.850
<v Speaker 5>taking them out of the city of Judah </v>
<v Speaker 5>that he was just destroying.</v>

1800
01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:40.240
<v Speaker 5>That's where by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Solomon's temple was destroyed by the </v>

1801
01:46:40.240 --> 01:46:41.210
<v Speaker 5>Babylonians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

1802
01:46:41.211 --> 01:46:46.211
<v Speaker 5>earning them bad pr in one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>important per books of all time.</v>

1803
01:46:48.110 --> 01:46:53.110
<v Speaker 5>The medes will scare the Babylonians to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the point where the Babylonians will </v>

1804
01:46:53.110 --> 01:46:57.060
<v Speaker 5>build something called the median wall </v>
<v Speaker 5>to hopefully slow them down.</v>

1805
01:46:57.480 --> 01:47:01.470
<v Speaker 5>And xenophile installed that to about </v>
<v Speaker 5>150 years later.</v>

1806
01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:07.400
<v Speaker 5>It was a wall that supposedly ran across</v>
<v Speaker 5>the narrow part of the division between </v>

1807
01:47:07.741 --> 01:47:11.100
<v Speaker 5>the Tigris and Euphrates river.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you'd have the river on two sides and</v>

1808
01:47:11.101 --> 01:47:16.101
<v Speaker 5>then this wall in the middle and </v>
<v Speaker 5>xenophon says that 200 years later it </v>

1809
01:47:16.101 --> 01:47:20.361
<v Speaker 5>was made a burnt bricks laid in bitumen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was 20 feet thick,</v>

1810
01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:25.050
<v Speaker 5>a hundred feet high and said to be 60 </v>
<v Speaker 5>miles long.</v>

1811
01:47:25.051 --> 01:47:29.520
<v Speaker 5>It is quite close to Babylon and quote </v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

1812
01:47:29.521 --> 01:47:34.521
<v Speaker 5>if he's lying about that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people who would know </v>

1813
01:47:34.521 --> 01:47:34.521
<v Speaker 5>that he was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'd have a reputation for that,</v>

1814
01:47:34.521 --> 01:47:39.051
<v Speaker 5>that would follow him unto our own time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the medes will famously go to war </v>

1815
01:47:42.150 --> 01:47:47.150
<v Speaker 5>with the Lydians and this is when some </v>
<v Speaker 5>of her [inaudible] really Hurghada test </v>

1816
01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:49.320
<v Speaker 5>has a little bit of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1817
01:47:49.590 --> 01:47:54.590
<v Speaker 5>a horror story and Alfred Hitchcock side</v>
<v Speaker 5>to him sometimes or maybe just the </v>

1818
01:47:55.711 --> 01:48:00.711
<v Speaker 5>people he talks to happen to because </v>
<v Speaker 5>during this little period which will </v>

1819
01:48:00.711 --> 01:48:04.971
<v Speaker 5>really only last like 40,</v>
<v Speaker 5>45 years between the fall of the </v>

1820
01:48:04.971 --> 01:48:08.270
<v Speaker 5>Assyrians and the rise of the Persians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be incidents that are </v>

1821
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:11.640
<v Speaker 5>eerily similar and you start to wonder </v>
<v Speaker 5>whether the guide telling you about them</v>

1822
01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:16.760
<v Speaker 5>or the people existing in this era have </v>
<v Speaker 5>a certain weakness for that sort of </v>

1823
01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:16.760
<v Speaker 5>incident.</v>

1824
01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:18.330
<v Speaker 5>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Heraclitus says,</v>

1825
01:48:18.450 --> 01:48:21.960
<v Speaker 5>this is how the war with the medes and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Lydian started.</v>

1826
01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:27.560
<v Speaker 5>There were some skiff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ian's who were hunters for the Medean </v>

1827
01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:29.520
<v Speaker 5>king,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that guy see accessories,</v>

1828
01:48:29.521 --> 01:48:32.550
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And normally they'd bring back food,</v>

1829
01:48:32.551 --> 01:48:36.990
<v Speaker 5>but one time they show up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Heraclitus says empty handed in front of</v>

1830
01:48:37.290 --> 01:48:40.200
<v Speaker 5>the accessories,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who supposedly Hurghada test says,</v>

1831
01:48:40.201 --> 01:48:42.870
<v Speaker 5>has this awful temper freaks out and </v>
<v Speaker 5>starts abusing,</v>

1832
01:48:42.871 --> 01:48:47.871
<v Speaker 5>including so physical abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One must imagined him kicking maybe </v>

1833
01:48:47.871 --> 01:48:49.690
<v Speaker 5>these skinny and archers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the skiff,</v>

1834
01:48:49.691 --> 01:48:54.691
<v Speaker 5>Ian's were never known to have </v>
<v Speaker 5>particularly non excitable temperaments,</v>

1835
01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:57.150
<v Speaker 5>shall we put it that way?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that fair?</v>

1836
01:48:58.050 --> 01:49:01.140
<v Speaker 5>And Hurghada to says that they went and </v>
<v Speaker 5>in their anger,</v>

1837
01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:06.440
<v Speaker 5>killed one of the boys probably from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>royal court that the Medean king had </v>

1838
01:49:06.661 --> 01:49:09.670
<v Speaker 5>sent to learn archery from these same </v>
<v Speaker 5>skiff.</v>

1839
01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:10.890
<v Speaker 5>Ian's wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're great archers.</v>

1840
01:49:10.891 --> 01:49:15.891
<v Speaker 5>Let's send some of the royal boys out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there and they can learn how to shoot </v>

1841
01:49:15.891 --> 01:49:17.460
<v Speaker 5>bows like an ancient Eurasian Steppe </v>
<v Speaker 5>Archer.</v>

1842
01:49:18.030 --> 01:49:23.030
<v Speaker 5>And they killed one of these boys Herata</v>
<v Speaker 5>to says and cut him up like the game </v>

1843
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:25.380
<v Speaker 5>that they normally give to the Medina </v>
<v Speaker 5>king showed up,</v>

1844
01:49:25.381 --> 01:49:27.360
<v Speaker 5>gave him the food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>watched him eat it.</v>

1845
01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:32.460
<v Speaker 5>Hahaha.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like putting urine into someone's </v>

1846
01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:33.840
<v Speaker 5>beer before you give it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The king finds out,</v>

1847
01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:35.220
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>goes after them.</v>

1848
01:49:35.221 --> 01:49:39.810
<v Speaker 5>They run to Lydia and then the median </v>
<v Speaker 5>king says,</v>

1849
01:49:39.811 --> 01:49:42.960
<v Speaker 5>I want those skit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The ones who cut up that boy and made me</v>

1850
01:49:42.961 --> 01:49:45.840
<v Speaker 5>eat him and Herat at this says that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>king of Lydia said,</v>

1851
01:49:45.841 --> 01:49:47.530
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't have him.</v>

1852
01:49:47.710 --> 01:49:52.710
<v Speaker 5>Boom war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we'll run into Hurghada telling a </v>

1853
01:49:52.710 --> 01:49:56.461
<v Speaker 5>similar story with an even greater </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychological twist very soon after </v>

1854
01:49:56.461 --> 01:49:57.220
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nonetheless,</v>

1855
01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:00.700
<v Speaker 5>this war with the medes and the Lydians </v>
<v Speaker 5>have gone for like five years.</v>

1856
01:50:00.810 --> 01:50:05.500
<v Speaker 5>Hurghada to says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we'll end with an.</v>

1857
01:50:05.610 --> 01:50:06.790
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have a fact here.</v>

1858
01:50:06.791 --> 01:50:08.620
<v Speaker 5>We can play with something that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't have to say.</v>

1859
01:50:08.621 --> 01:50:13.621
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she says this historian claims we've </v>

1860
01:50:13.621 --> 01:50:15.811
<v Speaker 5>heard from Herat at this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is a solar eclipse that happens on</v>

1861
01:50:16.331 --> 01:50:18.100
<v Speaker 5>May 28th,</v>
<v Speaker 5>five,</v>

1862
01:50:18.101 --> 01:50:19.800
<v Speaker 5>85 BC.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He</v>

1863
01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:24.410
<v Speaker 5>and at the time that solar eclipse </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened,</v>

1864
01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:29.800
<v Speaker 5>which by the way Hurghada says a Greek </v>
<v Speaker 5>predicted claiming it was the first time</v>

1865
01:50:29.811 --> 01:50:33.350
<v Speaker 5>that had ever been done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure the Babylonians probably pulled</v>

1866
01:50:33.351 --> 01:50:35.060
<v Speaker 5>off a few of those correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who knows?</v>

1867
01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:41.260
<v Speaker 5>Modern astronomers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course I have no problem going back </v>

1868
01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:44.620
<v Speaker 5>and with precision.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Calculating the date of that past </v>

1869
01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:48.190
<v Speaker 5>astronomical event,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is why we have a rare confirmable </v>

1870
01:50:48.190 --> 01:50:50.750
<v Speaker 5>fat at this point in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when that eclipse happened,</v>

1871
01:50:51.230 --> 01:50:56.230
<v Speaker 5>the medes and the Lydians happen to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting a battle and Hurghada to says,</v>

1872
01:50:56.661 --> 01:50:59.360
<v Speaker 5>as it was warming up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as the battle was getting hot,</v>

1873
01:50:59.870 --> 01:51:01.130
<v Speaker 5>there goes the sun.</v>

1874
01:51:02.590 --> 01:51:07.590
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you are an ancient person with the </v>

1875
01:51:07.590 --> 01:51:12.571
<v Speaker 5>religious beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you must imagine many of these ancient </v>

1876
01:51:12.571 --> 01:51:15.811
<v Speaker 5>people had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are few atheists in the ancient </v>

1877
01:51:15.811 --> 01:51:18.430
<v Speaker 5>world and sometimes it can be very </v>
<v Speaker 5>superstitious indeed,</v>

1878
01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:23.460
<v Speaker 5>as you might imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you're involved in a battle man </v>

1879
01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:23.740
<v Speaker 5>killing man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1880
01:51:23.741 --> 01:51:28.741
<v Speaker 5>both sides of almost certainly had </v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrifices and the omens examined and </v>

1881
01:51:28.781 --> 01:51:31.330
<v Speaker 5>they're looking at the liver and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is this a good day to attack?</v>

1882
01:51:31.331 --> 01:51:36.331
<v Speaker 5>And all these kinds of things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then in the middle of the battle of </v>

1883
01:51:36.331 --> 01:51:37.000
<v Speaker 5>the sun goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you going to think?</v>

1884
01:51:38.290 --> 01:51:39.820
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you might imagine,</v>

1885
01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:44.380
<v Speaker 5>the medes and the Lydian stopped </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting in the heat of the fighting.</v>

1886
01:51:44.381 --> 01:51:48.490
<v Speaker 5>They stopped fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're talking about tens of thousands of</v>

1887
01:51:48.491 --> 01:51:51.310
<v Speaker 5>people on each side and then everybody </v>
<v Speaker 5>just stops.</v>

1888
01:51:53.010 --> 01:51:56.070
<v Speaker 5>That's the way it's portrayed anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but think about it this way.</v>

1889
01:51:56.310 --> 01:51:59.160
<v Speaker 5>If an eclipse is really going to stop a </v>
<v Speaker 5>battle,</v>

1890
01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:02.550
<v Speaker 5>it's going to happen fast because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>eclipse doesn't last that long.</v>

1891
01:52:03.570 --> 01:52:08.570
<v Speaker 5>The piece was brokered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are told by another of the great </v>

1892
01:52:08.570 --> 01:52:10.290
<v Speaker 5>powers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Babylon and also the clique.</v>

1893
01:52:10.291 --> 01:52:15.291
<v Speaker 5>Ian's involved,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe you would call them a midsize </v>

1894
01:52:15.291 --> 01:52:16.110
<v Speaker 5>power in that region.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Regional power in that part of the world</v>

1895
01:52:16.770 --> 01:52:21.090
<v Speaker 5>and the deal sealed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are told in the traditional way,</v>

1896
01:52:21.091 --> 01:52:23.040
<v Speaker 5>although the Greeks did it a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>differently.</v>

1897
01:52:23.041 --> 01:52:28.041
<v Speaker 5>We're not told how both rulers slipped </v>
<v Speaker 5>their skin and suck blood from each </v>

1898
01:52:28.411 --> 01:52:33.411
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Also gave daughters and whatnot in </v>

1899
01:52:33.411 --> 01:52:34.860
<v Speaker 5>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the part I left out.</v>

1900
01:52:34.861 --> 01:52:39.030
<v Speaker 5>Two of the deal when the Babylonians and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the medes sign,</v>

1901
01:52:39.031 --> 01:52:44.031
<v Speaker 5>that agreement probably the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little vampiric blood sucking to go </v>

1902
01:52:44.031 --> 01:52:45.980
<v Speaker 5>along with it outside of Asher.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They destroy that a</v>

1903
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Syrian city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also married off daughters to each </v>

1904
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:54.431
<v Speaker 2>other and I mean it was one of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things where all of a sudden the </v>

1905
01:52:54.431 --> 01:52:56.471
<v Speaker 2>families are related as though that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really going to stop anything given the </v>

1906
01:52:56.471 --> 01:52:56.840
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

1907
01:52:56.841 --> 01:53:01.841
<v Speaker 2>they did the exact same deal here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a few daughters we can spread </v>

1908
01:53:01.841 --> 01:53:01.940
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got some blood weaken,</v>

1909
01:53:01.941 --> 01:53:02.860
<v Speaker 2>suck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and and,</v>

1910
01:53:02.990 --> 01:53:04.970
<v Speaker 2>and forever friends.</v>

1911
01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:11.520
<v Speaker 2>That bottle is known as the battle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Haley's river or the battle of the </v>

1912
01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:15.361
<v Speaker 2>eclipse sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now one thing that it's worth pointing </v>

1913
01:53:15.491 --> 01:53:20.491
<v Speaker 2>out from this period because it's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to matter in the north west and very </v>

1914
01:53:22.241 --> 01:53:26.470
<v Speaker 2>west parts of modern day Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anatolia,</v>

1915
01:53:26.890 --> 01:53:31.890
<v Speaker 2>as it was called earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our settlements and villages and cities </v>

1916
01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:36.880
<v Speaker 2>of Greeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're called Ionian Greeks,</v>

1917
01:53:36.970 --> 01:53:40.070
<v Speaker 2>but Greeks of one kind or another being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1918
01:53:40.090 --> 01:53:45.090
<v Speaker 2>such a seafaring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people around that region head in a </v>

1919
01:53:45.090 --> 01:53:46.540
<v Speaker 2>colonized that whole area a very long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time ago.</v>

1920
01:53:47.110 --> 01:53:49.480
<v Speaker 2>And they had relationships with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Greeks,</v>

1921
01:53:49.780 --> 01:53:51.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the mainland where places like Athens</v>

1922
01:53:51.911 --> 01:53:52.930
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

1923
01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:55.570
<v Speaker 2>You've got to imagine trade routes back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and forth,</v>

1924
01:53:55.571 --> 01:53:57.250
<v Speaker 2>people going back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1925
01:53:57.610 --> 01:54:02.610
<v Speaker 2>the part of the Greek world that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>located in modern day Turkey at this </v>

1926
01:54:02.610 --> 01:54:05.980
<v Speaker 2>time was the more sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more cultured than more learned.</v>

1927
01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Greeks in Athens and Sparta might </v>

1928
01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:11.380
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more feminine,</v>

1929
01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:11.830
<v Speaker 2>the more corrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more lazy,</v>

1930
01:54:11.831 --> 01:54:13.030
<v Speaker 2>the more opulent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1931
01:54:13.031 --> 01:54:15.640
<v Speaker 2>connected to all that eastern opulence </v>
<v Speaker 2>as they were.</v>

1932
01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:19.150
<v Speaker 2>See how that motif works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

1933
01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:23.890
<v Speaker 2>those Greeks in Anatolia will become a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big part of,</v>

1934
01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:29.070
<v Speaker 2>you know the problem because they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the part that links Asia back to the </v>

1935
01:54:29.261 --> 01:54:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Greek mainland and the Greek mainland </v>
<v Speaker 2>has an interest in how their,</v>

1936
01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:37.060
<v Speaker 2>shall we call them cousins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>second cousins,</v>

1937
01:54:37.450 --> 01:54:38.410
<v Speaker 2>how they're doing</v>

1938
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:44.750
<v Speaker 2>at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Battle of the eclipse figures out </v>

1939
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:45.000
<v Speaker 2>what's going on between the Lydians and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the medes.</v>

1940
01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:50.360
<v Speaker 2>Those Greeks are for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subject to the Lydian king that's going </v>

1941
01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:52.950
<v Speaker 2>to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to change for everybody.</v>

1942
01:54:54.410 --> 01:54:57.830
<v Speaker 2>What's about to happen in this region </v>
<v Speaker 2>that will affect the Greeks and everyone</v>

1943
01:54:57.831 --> 01:55:02.831
<v Speaker 2>else is every bit as shocking and </v>
<v Speaker 2>unexpected as the fall of Assyria was.</v>

1944
01:55:04.730 --> 01:55:09.730
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting that they will </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen within a reasonably historically </v>

1945
01:55:09.730 --> 01:55:10.010
<v Speaker 2>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>short period of time from each other.</v>

1946
01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:14.510
<v Speaker 2>You have to imagine that analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had the United States disappearing in</v>

1947
01:55:14.511 --> 01:55:17.330
<v Speaker 2>five to 15 years and what would the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world look like after that?</v>

1948
01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if I told you that within,</v>

1949
01:55:20.210 --> 01:55:25.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another 20 or 30 years after that one </v>

1950
01:55:25.210 --> 01:55:25.210
<v Speaker 2>country that you'd never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1951
01:55:25.210 --> 01:55:28.880
<v Speaker 2>some out of the way place had taken over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire planet.</v>

1952
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:34.750
<v Speaker 2>That's how this analogy works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we start trying to realize that </v>

1953
01:55:34.750 --> 01:55:37.331
<v Speaker 2>somehow this people call the Persians </v>
<v Speaker 2>will first get their control over the </v>

1954
01:55:37.331 --> 01:55:39.800
<v Speaker 2>means and how that even happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1955
01:55:39.801 --> 01:55:40.610
<v Speaker 2>recess are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>

1956
01:55:40.611 --> 01:55:43.070
<v Speaker 2>the author has a great line where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>points out that,</v>

1957
01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the fall</v>

1958
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:47.460
<v Speaker 5>of the last great Assyrian monarch and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the rise of Cyrus the great.</v>

1959
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:51.180
<v Speaker 5>There's no mention of these Persian </v>
<v Speaker 5>people in any text,</v>

1960
01:55:51.210 --> 01:55:54.930
<v Speaker 5>in any politically significant way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are virtual.</v>

1961
01:55:55.020 --> 01:56:00.020
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's and within a generation they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>running the show for everyone in this </v>

1962
01:56:00.301 --> 01:56:02.610
<v Speaker 5>part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How did that happen?</v>

1963
01:56:05.020 --> 01:56:10.020
<v Speaker 5>Judging from the overwhelming number of </v>
<v Speaker 5>historians from ancient times all the </v>

1964
01:56:10.721 --> 01:56:11.950
<v Speaker 5>way to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1965
01:56:11.951 --> 01:56:14.800
<v Speaker 5>the latest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>often contrarian writings,</v>

1966
01:56:15.580 --> 01:56:20.580
<v Speaker 5>the lion's share of the answer seems to </v>
<v Speaker 5>have something to do with this </v>

1967
01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:24.250
<v Speaker 5>incredible leader.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus the second also called,</v>

1968
01:56:24.251 --> 01:56:26.830
<v Speaker 5>as we said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus the great.</v>

1969
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:32.010
<v Speaker 5>There are lots of stories by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and some of them are fantastic.</v>

1970
01:56:32.250 --> 01:56:37.250
<v Speaker 5>One of her auditees is best is one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the ones you know he tells about the </v>

1971
01:56:37.250 --> 01:56:38.100
<v Speaker 5>rise of Cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you have to remember something.</v>

1972
01:56:38.670 --> 01:56:43.670
<v Speaker 5>This person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cyrus the great is to Persian and </v>

1973
01:56:43.670 --> 01:56:48.081
<v Speaker 5>Iranian history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of what George Washington is to </v>

1974
01:56:48.081 --> 01:56:50.100
<v Speaker 5>American history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what King Arthur is to British legend.</v>

1975
01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:55.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is a legendary figure and </v>
<v Speaker 5>because there so little that talks about</v>

1976
01:56:55.291 --> 01:57:00.291
<v Speaker 5>him during his rise to power historians </v>
<v Speaker 5>are in a really thrust into the </v>

1977
01:57:00.291 --> 01:57:03.870
<v Speaker 5>detective role trying to figure out what</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is you know is going on.</v>

1978
01:57:04.710 --> 01:57:09.710
<v Speaker 5>I liked the way historian peer brand </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of tries to explain what sort of </v>

1979
01:57:09.710 --> 01:57:11.070
<v Speaker 5>assumption she should maybe build into </v>
<v Speaker 5>this and I'm not a historian,</v>

1980
01:57:11.071 --> 01:57:16.071
<v Speaker 5>so he was writing as a historian trying </v>
<v Speaker 5>to explain to a lay person like yours </v>

1981
01:57:16.071 --> 01:57:16.071
<v Speaker 5>truly.</v>

1982
01:57:16.071 --> 01:57:17.460
<v Speaker 5>Let's hope the layperson understood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he kind of said,</v>

1983
01:57:17.850 --> 01:57:22.850
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if something that appears to happen out </v>

1984
01:57:22.850 --> 01:57:23.010
<v Speaker 5>of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's unlikely that it could,</v>

1985
01:57:23.250 --> 01:57:26.250
<v Speaker 5>you should assume that there was stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>bubbling up under the surface,</v>

1986
01:57:26.340 --> 01:57:28.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a foundation taking place.</v>

1987
01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:31.590
<v Speaker 5>But that's hidden from our eyes through </v>
<v Speaker 5>the historical veil,</v>

1988
01:57:31.591 --> 01:57:36.591
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when a cyrus the great all of a </v>

1989
01:57:36.591 --> 01:57:39.381
<v Speaker 5>sudden takes over the muddy and empire </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it looks like a lightning bolt </v>

1990
01:57:39.381 --> 01:57:42.261
<v Speaker 5>strikes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's probably safe to assume things had </v>

1991
01:57:42.261 --> 01:57:42.570
<v Speaker 5>been leading up to this somehow for </v>
<v Speaker 5>awhile,</v>

1992
01:57:43.650 --> 01:57:48.650
<v Speaker 5>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things historians like to </v>

1993
01:57:48.650 --> 01:57:51.440
<v Speaker 5>suggest was percolating beneath the </v>
<v Speaker 5>scene that you couldn't see with </v>

1994
01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:54.570
<v Speaker 5>something like rot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess you could say maybe moral rot.</v>

1995
01:57:55.110 --> 01:57:57.120
<v Speaker 5>This is something that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1996
01:57:57.210 --> 01:58:00.840
<v Speaker 5>part of earlier histories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And because it's impossible to quantify,</v>

1997
01:58:00.841 --> 01:58:02.670
<v Speaker 5>I mean we could even ask these questions</v>
<v Speaker 5>a day,</v>

1998
01:58:02.671 --> 01:58:04.230
<v Speaker 5>is there any truth to the idea?</v>

1999
01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:09.260
<v Speaker 5>And we have by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the older generations in tougher </v>

2000
01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:12.681
<v Speaker 5>times are tougher than we are today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If there is any truth to that because </v>

2001
01:58:12.681 --> 01:58:14.310
<v Speaker 5>that had been true in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How would a historian even measure that?</v>

2002
01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:19.700
<v Speaker 5>So they don't anymore writing in 1935 </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I love him,</v>

2003
01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:23.200
<v Speaker 5>but it was written in 1935 historian </v>
<v Speaker 5>will,</v>

2004
01:58:23.201 --> 01:58:25.260
<v Speaker 5>Duran tries to tie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2005
01:58:25.261 --> 01:58:28.860
<v Speaker 5>the downfall of the media to their moral</v>
<v Speaker 5>degeneration.</v>

2006
01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:32.130
<v Speaker 5>And the fact that they were sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>nouveau riche,</v>

2007
01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:33.390
<v Speaker 5>he writes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

2008
01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:37.410
<v Speaker 5>their degeneration was even more rapid </v>
<v Speaker 5>than their rise.</v>

2009
01:58:37.770 --> 01:58:42.340
<v Speaker 5>Osteology who succeeded his father.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See accessories proved again,</v>

2010
01:58:42.341 --> 01:58:45.490
<v Speaker 5>that monarchy is a gamble in who's royal</v>
<v Speaker 5>succession,</v>

2011
01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:48.640
<v Speaker 5>great wits and madness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or nearly allied.</v>

2012
01:58:48.820 --> 01:58:52.870
<v Speaker 5>He inherited a kingdom with equanimity </v>
<v Speaker 5>and settled down to enjoy it.</v>

2013
01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:55.330
<v Speaker 5>Under his example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the nation for God.</v>

2014
01:58:55.331 --> 01:58:58.870
<v Speaker 5>It's Stern,</v>
<v Speaker 5>morals and stoic ways wealth had come to</v>

2015
01:58:58.871 --> 01:59:00.700
<v Speaker 5>suddenly to be wisely used.</v>

2016
01:59:00.970 --> 01:59:04.450
<v Speaker 5>The upper classes became the slaves of </v>
<v Speaker 5>fashion and luxury.</v>

2017
01:59:04.690 --> 01:59:09.690
<v Speaker 5>The men wore embroidered trousers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The women covered themselves with </v>

2018
01:59:09.690 --> 01:59:12.280
<v Speaker 5>cosmetics and jewelry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The very horses were often comparison to</v>

2019
01:59:12.281 --> 01:59:17.281
<v Speaker 5>in gold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These once simple and pastoral people </v>

2020
01:59:17.281 --> 01:59:20.820
<v Speaker 5>who had been glad to be carried in rude </v>
<v Speaker 5>wagons with wheels cut roughly out of </v>

2021
01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:24.661
<v Speaker 5>the trunks of trees now road and </v>
<v Speaker 5>expensive chariots from feast to Feast </v>

2022
01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:27.190
<v Speaker 5>and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The truth is though,</v>

2023
01:59:27.191 --> 01:59:32.191
<v Speaker 5>that what Doran rights there in 1935 </v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't a whole lot different from what </v>

2024
01:59:32.191 --> 01:59:36.751
<v Speaker 5>the ancient Greeks saw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The ancient Greeks sorta saw themselves </v>

2025
01:59:36.751 --> 01:59:40.441
<v Speaker 5>as Marlboro men compared to these people</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the east that were at best sort of </v>

2026
01:59:41.111 --> 01:59:44.560
<v Speaker 5>Metro sexuals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Greeks likes to point out the use of</v>

2027
01:59:44.561 --> 01:59:49.561
<v Speaker 5>makeup as part of their idea that these </v>
<v Speaker 5>easterners were a feminist writing </v>

2028
01:59:49.561 --> 01:59:50.680
<v Speaker 5>hundreds of years later.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

2029
01:59:50.681 --> 01:59:55.681
<v Speaker 5>xenophon talks about osteology is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>last king of the medes and his </v>

2030
01:59:55.681 --> 01:59:57.700
<v Speaker 5>guidelines,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess you would call it today,</v>

2031
01:59:57.701 --> 02:00:00.010
<v Speaker 5>his stencilled eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rouge on his face,</v>

2032
02:00:00.011 --> 02:00:02.860
<v Speaker 5>and xenophon who would have no way of </v>
<v Speaker 5>knowing,</v>

2033
02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:05.620
<v Speaker 5>says a wig have fake hair.</v>

2034
02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:07.840
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's the thing though,</v>

2035
02:00:08.680 --> 02:00:13.680
<v Speaker 5>in the east,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these kinds of things were cultural </v>

2036
02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:13.680
<v Speaker 5>norms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't a sign of a feminist.</v>

2037
02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:18.420
<v Speaker 5>The Pharaohs and the Egyptians had been </v>
<v Speaker 5>using the dark coal around the eyes </v>

2038
02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:20.560
<v Speaker 5>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just a different cultural thing,</v>

2039
02:00:20.561 --> 02:00:24.700
<v Speaker 5>but the Greeks saw it as just another </v>
<v Speaker 5>sign of these oriental.</v>

2040
02:00:25.210 --> 02:00:28.360
<v Speaker 5>If Feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Opulent Week,</v>

2041
02:00:28.810 --> 02:00:30.280
<v Speaker 5>Clever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sneaky,</v>

2042
02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:31.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fill in the blank.</v>

2043
02:00:31.870 --> 02:00:36.870
<v Speaker 5>Easterners,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will leave it to the credible </v>

2044
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:41.370
<v Speaker 5>historians to decide some day whether </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's any truth to this motif about </v>

2045
02:00:41.651 --> 02:00:45.850
<v Speaker 5>the medes sort of slouching towards </v>
<v Speaker 5>Gomorrah or what have you.</v>

2046
02:00:45.851 --> 02:00:50.851
<v Speaker 5>Most of the modern stuff I read today </v>
<v Speaker 5>looks at that as a as a terribly old </v>

2047
02:00:50.851 --> 02:00:52.480
<v Speaker 5>fashioned way to view the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as I said,</v>

2048
02:00:52.481 --> 02:00:54.460
<v Speaker 5>how do you quantify something like that </v>
<v Speaker 5>anyway,</v>

2049
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:58.810
<v Speaker 5>but if you follow that narrative the way</v>
<v Speaker 5>a guy like Hurghada test is taking it or</v>

2050
02:00:58.811 --> 02:01:01.720
<v Speaker 5>a guy like will durant writing in 1935 </v>
<v Speaker 5>is taking it.</v>

2051
02:01:02.380 --> 02:01:07.380
<v Speaker 5>There's an almost opportunity created by</v>
<v Speaker 5>the decadence of the medes and the </v>

2052
02:01:07.380 --> 02:01:08.200
<v Speaker 5>cruelty of their ruler.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

2053
02:01:09.010 --> 02:01:14.010
<v Speaker 5>and that can be exploited by somebody </v>
<v Speaker 5>who has the opposite values from the </v>

2054
02:01:14.010 --> 02:01:14.920
<v Speaker 5>people that are busy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>slouching towards Gomorrah.</v>

2055
02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:20.040
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that were less corrupted by </v>

2056
02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:20.040
<v Speaker 5>luxury,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who were not as decadent,</v>

2057
02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:21.160
<v Speaker 5>who were more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shall we say,</v>

2058
02:01:22.030 --> 02:01:25.450
<v Speaker 5>possessors of the old time virtues,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you will,</v>

2059
02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:30.960
<v Speaker 5>and this gets us back to a secondary </v>
<v Speaker 5>value that a guy like Herat at this has </v>

2060
02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:30.960
<v Speaker 5>for us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember,</v>

2061
02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:31.710
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like the color era,</v>

2062
02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:34.520
<v Speaker 5>the first real screenwriter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>writer show runner,</v>

2063
02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:38.710
<v Speaker 5>and and you learn two things from a guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>writing the way he writes in the way.</v>

2064
02:01:38.711 --> 02:01:39.950
<v Speaker 5>A lot of after him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2065
02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:41.630
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you learn about these events.</v>

2066
02:01:41.631 --> 02:01:46.631
<v Speaker 5>He's trying to relate to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which may or may not be true and are </v>

2067
02:01:46.631 --> 02:01:46.631
<v Speaker 5>probably a combination of the two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2068
02:01:46.631 --> 02:01:47.850
<v Speaker 5>We learned about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2069
02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:51.020
<v Speaker 5>the rise of Cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least the story that this guy heard,</v>

2070
02:01:51.410 --> 02:01:56.410
<v Speaker 5>but at the same time you're having like </v>
<v Speaker 5>a Vulcan Mind Meld with a 2,500</v>

2071
02:01:58.581 --> 02:02:03.581
<v Speaker 5>year old basically alien mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a one way conversation with a 2,500</v>

2072
02:02:06.171 --> 02:02:07.100
<v Speaker 5>year old guy</v>

2073
02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:10.750
<v Speaker 5>and when you read Hurghada,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just this,</v>

2074
02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:11.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2075
02:02:11.700 --> 02:02:16.700
<v Speaker 5>I really wish I could speak the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 5>Greek and read it and understand the </v>

2076
02:02:16.761 --> 02:02:21.761
<v Speaker 5>little nuances so I could really hear </v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy in his own words as he meant </v>

2077
02:02:21.761 --> 02:02:24.860
<v Speaker 5>every specific word.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you getting a chance to see,</v>

2078
02:02:25.370 --> 02:02:30.370
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what this guy from a completely </v>

2079
02:02:30.370 --> 02:02:32.741
<v Speaker 5>different time period likes and dislikes</v>
<v Speaker 5>his worldview.</v>

2080
02:02:34.011 --> 02:02:36.080
<v Speaker 5>What he thinks is good and what he </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinks is bad.</v>

2081
02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:39.200
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his view sort of on the supernatural and</v>

2082
02:02:39.201 --> 02:02:42.500
<v Speaker 5>the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his biases and his prejudices.</v>

2083
02:02:43.370 --> 02:02:47.870
<v Speaker 5>You're learning about he and his world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you read his stuff,</v>

2084
02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.850
<v Speaker 5>part of what you have to filter it so </v>
<v Speaker 5>carefully because just like all of us,</v>

2085
02:02:51.851 --> 02:02:54.420
<v Speaker 5>his world pollutes his worldview so that</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2086
02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:58.840
<v Speaker 5>we don't get as nonbiased a view now as </v>
<v Speaker 5>we might want,</v>

2087
02:02:59.290 --> 02:03:04.290
<v Speaker 5>but what Hurghada tests does in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>story is kind of say that because </v>

2088
02:03:04.290 --> 02:03:08.920
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] was the way he was a cyrus </v>
<v Speaker 5>arises on the scene.</v>

2089
02:03:10.690 --> 02:03:15.520
<v Speaker 5>Modern Day historians can't decide or </v>
<v Speaker 5>argue over whether or not there was some</v>

2090
02:03:15.521 --> 02:03:18.100
<v Speaker 5>war fought between the medes and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Persians.</v>

2091
02:03:18.101 --> 02:03:20.320
<v Speaker 5>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are for the most part,</v>

2092
02:03:20.620 --> 02:03:23.770
<v Speaker 5>semi tribal peoples probably at this </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2093
02:03:24.040 --> 02:03:25.720
<v Speaker 5>They used to think they were more like </v>
<v Speaker 5>states.</v>

2094
02:03:25.721 --> 02:03:27.070
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no one's sure.</v>

2095
02:03:27.071 --> 02:03:32.071
<v Speaker 5>Maybe a combination of some cities with </v>
<v Speaker 5>some pastoral people that were lied to </v>

2096
02:03:32.071 --> 02:03:36.160
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an interesting sort of hybrid and </v>

2097
02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:38.401
<v Speaker 5>there might've been a lot of these kinds</v>
<v Speaker 5>of societies around back then when </v>

2098
02:03:38.401 --> 02:03:38.500
<v Speaker 5>they're transitioning from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2099
02:03:38.501 --> 02:03:43.501
<v Speaker 5>an old tribal world to something more </v>
<v Speaker 5>along the lines of a centralized </v>

2100
02:03:43.501 --> 02:03:45.340
<v Speaker 5>bureaucratic state.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you're in sort of a tweener zone,</v>

2101
02:03:45.341 --> 02:03:50.341
<v Speaker 5>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So either a war between these medes and </v>

2102
02:03:50.341 --> 02:03:50.980
<v Speaker 5>the Persians or the tribes that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>controlled,</v>

2103
02:03:51.610 --> 02:03:54.490
<v Speaker 5>or sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as one historian described it,</v>

2104
02:03:55.030 --> 02:03:59.230
<v Speaker 5>the Medean empire getting a change in </v>
<v Speaker 5>management</v>

2105
02:04:00.840 --> 02:04:05.840
<v Speaker 5>with maybe some Medea nobles helping to </v>
<v Speaker 5>rebel against this osteology person and </v>

2106
02:04:06.691 --> 02:04:11.691
<v Speaker 5>modern historians have some interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>understandable sort of common sense </v>

2107
02:04:11.691 --> 02:04:14.460
<v Speaker 5>reasons why they might want to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The theory is that this osteology guy is</v>

2108
02:04:14.461 --> 02:04:19.461
<v Speaker 5>trying to convert the leads into more of</v>
<v Speaker 5>a typical centralized Mesopotamian </v>

2109
02:04:21.151 --> 02:04:24.060
<v Speaker 5>government.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where the king is is more autocratic.</v>

2110
02:04:24.061 --> 02:04:29.061
<v Speaker 5>It has a lot more authority.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like maybe he has to share a </v>

2111
02:04:29.061 --> 02:04:31.560
<v Speaker 5>lot of authority with these different </v>
<v Speaker 5>tribal rulers and as you might imagine,</v>

2112
02:04:31.561 --> 02:04:35.820
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like a law of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're unlikely to like that.</v>

2113
02:04:36.150 --> 02:04:41.150
<v Speaker 5>This may have some modern historians </v>
<v Speaker 5>think to sort of an uprising and </v>

2114
02:04:41.150 --> 02:04:41.850
<v Speaker 5>internal coup,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you will.</v>

2115
02:04:42.150 --> 02:04:47.150
<v Speaker 5>And this Cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the second guy might be the person who </v>

2116
02:04:47.150 --> 02:04:50.751
<v Speaker 5>gets to lead this now as the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 5>early screen writer,</v>

2117
02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:56.010
<v Speaker 5>Hirata tess has his own view of sorta </v>
<v Speaker 5>what turns the tables on this.</v>

2118
02:04:56.580 --> 02:04:57.870
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of these stories that,</v>

2119
02:04:57.871 --> 02:05:02.871
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe tells us more about Hurghada and </v>

2120
02:05:02.871 --> 02:05:06.021
<v Speaker 5>the audience he's trying to please,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he must've heard this story </v>

2121
02:05:06.021 --> 02:05:10.071
<v Speaker 5>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a typical tale by the way of </v>

2122
02:05:10.071 --> 02:05:12.441
<v Speaker 5>oriental cruelty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he setting up something that </v>

2123
02:05:12.441 --> 02:05:16.400
<v Speaker 5>actually seemed to happen in the story </v>
<v Speaker 5>and trying to give you a reason why it </v>

2124
02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:20.271
<v Speaker 5>happened without having any real way of </v>
<v Speaker 5>knowing other than these people he's </v>

2125
02:05:20.271 --> 02:05:23.841
<v Speaker 5>talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He tells one of the most horrific </v>

2126
02:05:23.841 --> 02:05:26.271
<v Speaker 5>stories in his writings,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he tells it like Alfred Hitchcock or</v>

2127
02:05:26.701 --> 02:05:31.260
<v Speaker 5>west craven or someone like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We alluded to it earlier when we said in</v>

2128
02:05:31.261 --> 02:05:32.660
<v Speaker 5>an earlier story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2129
02:05:32.661 --> 02:05:34.130
<v Speaker 5>those [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2130
02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:37.860
<v Speaker 5>killed a boy and served it to the and </v>
<v Speaker 5>king and he didn't like that.</v>

2131
02:05:38.190 --> 02:05:39.720
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in this story,</v>

2132
02:05:39.721 --> 02:05:41.850
<v Speaker 5>it's that same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but with an extra twist.</v>

2133
02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:44.480
<v Speaker 5>I have several different versions of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Heraclitus.</v>

2134
02:05:45.150 --> 02:05:47.460
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but let me set this up.</v>

2135
02:05:47.461 --> 02:05:52.050
<v Speaker 5>What happens in the story is it concerns</v>
<v Speaker 5>this osteology guy,</v>

2136
02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:57.080
<v Speaker 5>the son of succe accessories and nowhere</v>
<v Speaker 5>near his father in terms of greatness </v>

2137
02:05:57.511 --> 02:06:00.060
<v Speaker 5>and kind of a jerk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the way he's portrayed.</v>

2138
02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:04.080
<v Speaker 5>And he has a dream and that these </v>
<v Speaker 5>dreams,</v>

2139
02:06:04.081 --> 02:06:06.540
<v Speaker 5>you got to love ancient history because </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're always so wild.</v>

2140
02:06:06.541 --> 02:06:11.541
<v Speaker 5>Hurghada tests related by the way the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dream has something to do with his </v>

2141
02:06:11.541 --> 02:06:13.410
<v Speaker 5>daughter urinating over the whole world </v>
<v Speaker 5>or something,</v>

2142
02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:15.390
<v Speaker 5>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>got to love the ancient history.</v>

2143
02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:19.140
<v Speaker 5>And he asked the Magic to interpret it </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they say,</v>

2144
02:06:19.260 --> 02:06:24.260
<v Speaker 5>I'm not very good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This daughter's gonna give birth to </v>

2145
02:06:24.260 --> 02:06:24.990
<v Speaker 5>something or she's the seed of something</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's maybe going to overthrow you.</v>

2146
02:06:24.991 --> 02:06:29.190
<v Speaker 5>And so to play it safe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hurghada says he marries her off to some</v>

2147
02:06:29.191 --> 02:06:30.990
<v Speaker 5>Persian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2148
02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:32.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe a great Persian guy,</v>

2149
02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:37.551
<v Speaker 5>but this is the muddy and empire and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and no son of a Persian is going to be </v>

2150
02:06:37.551 --> 02:06:37.590
<v Speaker 5>ruling the midian empire.</v>

2151
02:06:37.590 --> 02:06:40.320
<v Speaker 5>So that's been taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then about a year later,</v>

2152
02:06:40.321 --> 02:06:45.321
<v Speaker 5>Herat at this says he has another dream </v>
<v Speaker 5>about his daughter who's about to give </v>

2153
02:06:45.321 --> 02:06:47.640
<v Speaker 5>birth to her first child.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in this dream he sees,</v>

2154
02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:52.940
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like vines coming out of her womb </v>

2155
02:06:52.940 --> 02:06:53.130
<v Speaker 5>and then encompassing the whole earth or</v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

2156
02:06:53.190 --> 02:06:55.550
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>akin to that and the match.</v>

2157
02:06:55.551 --> 02:06:57.960
<v Speaker 5>I come in and interpret that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and as you might imagine,</v>

2158
02:06:57.961 --> 02:07:01.830
<v Speaker 5>it's not good and it scares osteology </v>
<v Speaker 5>who thinks that she,</v>

2159
02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:04.920
<v Speaker 5>his daughter is going to give birth to a</v>
<v Speaker 5>person who takes his throne.</v>

2160
02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:08.550
<v Speaker 5>So in a story that you see in other </v>
<v Speaker 5>tales,</v>

2161
02:07:08.551 --> 02:07:13.551
<v Speaker 5>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a pretty common motif with </v>

2162
02:07:13.551 --> 02:07:15.420
<v Speaker 5>different twists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Osteology calls in the general.</v>

2163
02:07:16.290 --> 02:07:21.290
<v Speaker 5>A guy named Harper Gus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who seems to be a historical figure and </v>

2164
02:07:21.290 --> 02:07:23.700
<v Speaker 5>tells harper guests to get rid of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>baby.</v>

2165
02:07:24.780 --> 02:07:27.840
<v Speaker 5>Now Harper Guess Herata says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't want to get rid of the baby.</v>

2166
02:07:28.290 --> 02:07:30.900
<v Speaker 5>Just let me stop for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In this story,</v>

2167
02:07:30.910 --> 02:07:33.240
<v Speaker 5>Heraclitus is lovingly telling this </v>
<v Speaker 5>story.</v>

2168
02:07:33.241 --> 02:07:38.241
<v Speaker 5>He knows what the colorful pieces are </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he says he doesn't want to get rid </v>

2169
02:07:39.251 --> 02:07:40.870
<v Speaker 5>of the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't want to kill a baby.</v>

2170
02:07:41.140 --> 02:07:45.970
<v Speaker 5>So he gives the job to a shepherd and </v>
<v Speaker 5>gives the shepherd the baby and says,</v>

2171
02:07:45.971 --> 02:07:48.040
<v Speaker 5>get rid of the baby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>expose it,</v>

2172
02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:50.200
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>out into the open and let it die,</v>

2173
02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:56.040
<v Speaker 5>and the shepherd doesn't want to get rid</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the baby and it just so happens his </v>

2174
02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:58.780
<v Speaker 5>wife is pregnant and she gives birth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Adjust this time to a stillborn child.</v>

2175
02:07:59.230 --> 02:08:02.230
<v Speaker 5>Doesn't this sound like a bunch of old </v>
<v Speaker 5>grimms fairy tales at this point?</v>

2176
02:08:02.620 --> 02:08:07.620
<v Speaker 5>So as you might imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they take the stillborn child rapid in </v>

2177
02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:09.460
<v Speaker 5>the royal close,</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep the live when they were supposed to</v>

2178
02:08:09.461 --> 02:08:11.630
<v Speaker 5>kill and give the stillborn child back </v>
<v Speaker 5>to heart,</v>

2179
02:08:11.650 --> 02:08:13.710
<v Speaker 5>biggest to give to his boss,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to king and stacy.</v>

2180
02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:18.840
<v Speaker 5>It was done fast forward 13 years later </v>
<v Speaker 5>or something like that and a boy is </v>

2181
02:08:19.991 --> 02:08:24.991
<v Speaker 5>brought before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the headwater two story </v>

2182
02:08:24.991 --> 02:08:26.971
<v Speaker 5>osteology because he's been whipping </v>
<v Speaker 5>boys higher on the social standing </v>

2183
02:08:26.971 --> 02:08:27.310
<v Speaker 5>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then he,</v>

2184
02:08:27.610 --> 02:08:32.610
<v Speaker 5>after a bunch of questioning it is </v>
<v Speaker 5>determined and again this is the </v>

2185
02:08:32.610 --> 02:08:33.630
<v Speaker 5>wonderfulness of the ancient mind meld </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're having with Hurghada.</v>

2186
02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:38.350
<v Speaker 5>This that basically osteology can tell </v>
<v Speaker 5>that this boy is a king.</v>

2187
02:08:38.650 --> 02:08:42.010
<v Speaker 5>It's like in your DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can tell the difference between blue</v>

2188
02:08:42.011 --> 02:08:45.790
<v Speaker 5>bloods and non blue bloods by the way </v>
<v Speaker 5>they handle situations and it's inbred.</v>

2189
02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:51.600
<v Speaker 5>Besides that osteology notices that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>kid looks like him and after all he is </v>

2190
02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:53.770
<v Speaker 5>his grandfather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He calls in hospice.</v>

2191
02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:56.380
<v Speaker 5>Then he calls in the shepherd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He does a little investigation,</v>

2192
02:08:56.381 --> 02:09:01.381
<v Speaker 5>figures the whole story out and pretends</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's not mad.</v>

2193
02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:04.150
<v Speaker 5>Tells heart biggest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's often felt,</v>

2194
02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:06.040
<v Speaker 5>I'm paraphrasing here from paralysis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2195
02:09:06.190 --> 02:09:09.250
<v Speaker 5>but tells harper because he's often felt</v>
<v Speaker 5>bad about the whole thing afterwards.</v>

2196
02:09:09.250 --> 02:09:14.250
<v Speaker 5>So He's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's secretly relieved that the whole </v>

2197
02:09:14.250 --> 02:09:14.250
<v Speaker 5>thing went the way it did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you go home,</v>

2198
02:09:14.590 --> 02:09:19.590
<v Speaker 5>tell your wife we're going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>banquet to celebrate all this and you </v>

2199
02:09:19.590 --> 02:09:19.590
<v Speaker 5>can come over and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2200
02:09:19.590 --> 02:09:20.730
<v Speaker 5>and we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll highlight you at the banquet.</v>

2201
02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:24.160
<v Speaker 5>Send your son over your 13 year old son </v>
<v Speaker 5>so he can keep the new boy,</v>

2202
02:09:24.161 --> 02:09:26.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my grandson company and uh,</v>

2203
02:09:26.260 --> 02:09:31.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll have a party tonight and </v>

2204
02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:33.690
<v Speaker 5>Heraclitus says that heartbeat has goes </v>
<v Speaker 5>back home and he's relieved because he </v>

2205
02:09:33.690 --> 02:09:36.811
<v Speaker 5>knows he could have gotten in big </v>
<v Speaker 5>trouble and the wife is happy and they </v>

2206
02:09:36.811 --> 02:09:38.050
<v Speaker 5>go to this banquet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is where Alfred Hitchcock,</v>

2207
02:09:38.051 --> 02:09:41.080
<v Speaker 5>Hurghada test of helicopter takes the </v>
<v Speaker 5>story over.</v>

2208
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:43.360
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I keep telling myself,</v>

2209
02:09:43.420 --> 02:09:45.520
<v Speaker 5>I don't think this is making this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

2210
02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:50.760
<v Speaker 5>Somebody told him this story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what somebody somewhere </v>

2211
02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:55.381
<v Speaker 5>believed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now listen to this and try to imagine a </v>

2212
02:09:55.381 --> 02:09:58.921
<v Speaker 5>story like this from the Assyrians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Babylonians or the ancient </v>

2213
02:09:59.711 --> 02:10:00.850
<v Speaker 5>Mesopotamians.</v>

2214
02:10:00.850 --> 02:10:03.910
<v Speaker 5>They just didn't write this way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hurghada is a story.</v>

2215
02:10:03.911 --> 02:10:08.911
<v Speaker 5>Has the 13 year old son of heart biggest</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to the palace as requested and </v>

2216
02:10:09.191 --> 02:10:14.191
<v Speaker 5>then picks up the story and says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is from my discipline core </v>

2217
02:10:14.191 --> 02:10:14.830
<v Speaker 5>translation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

2218
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:17.440
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when Harper gets his son,</v>

2219
02:10:17.441 --> 02:10:19.370
<v Speaker 5>arrived at the palace,</v>
<v Speaker 5>last Dr,</v>

2220
02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:22.600
<v Speaker 5>had him butchered,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cut up into joints and cooked,</v>

2221
02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:27.870
<v Speaker 5>roasting some boiling the rest and </v>
<v Speaker 5>having the whole properly prepared for </v>

2222
02:10:27.870 --> 02:10:32.611
<v Speaker 5>the table.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dinner Time came and the guests </v>

2223
02:10:32.611 --> 02:10:33.740
<v Speaker 5>assembled with heart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Biggest among them dishes of mutton were</v>

2224
02:10:33.741 --> 02:10:38.741
<v Speaker 5>placed in front of osteology is then if </v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone else except purpose to purpose </v>

2225
02:10:38.741 --> 02:10:42.320
<v Speaker 5>was served the flesh of his son.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of it except for the head,</v>

2226
02:10:42.380 --> 02:10:47.380
<v Speaker 5>the hands and feet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which had been put separately on a </v>

2227
02:10:47.380 --> 02:10:47.380
<v Speaker 5>platter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>covered with a lid.</v>

2228
02:10:47.380 --> 02:10:49.700
<v Speaker 5>When heartbreak is thought he had eaten </v>
<v Speaker 5>as much as he wanted.</v>

2229
02:10:50.050 --> 02:10:52.400
<v Speaker 5>I asked him if he enjoyed his dinner.</v>

2230
02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:55.130
<v Speaker 5>He answered that he had enjoyed it very </v>
<v Speaker 5>much indeed.</v>

2231
02:10:55.340 --> 02:10:59.750
<v Speaker 5>Where upon those whose business it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do so brought in the boy's head,</v>

2232
02:10:59.810 --> 02:11:03.000
<v Speaker 5>hands and feet in the covered dish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stood by heart,</v>

2233
02:11:03.001 --> 02:11:08.001
<v Speaker 5>biggest his chair,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and told him to lift the lid and take </v>

2234
02:11:08.001 --> 02:11:08.001
<v Speaker 5>what he fancied.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Heart biggest,</v>

2235
02:11:08.001 --> 02:11:12.971
<v Speaker 5>remove the cover and saw the fragments </v>
<v Speaker 5>of his son's body as he kept control of </v>

2236
02:11:12.971 --> 02:11:17.651
<v Speaker 5>himself and did not lose his head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If the dreadful cite us dog has asked </v>

2237
02:11:17.651 --> 02:11:19.550
<v Speaker 5>him if he knew what animal it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whose flesh he had just eaten.</v>

2238
02:11:19.970 --> 02:11:24.970
<v Speaker 5>I know my Lord was her biggest this </v>
<v Speaker 5>reply and from my part may the kings </v>

2239
02:11:24.970 --> 02:11:27.020
<v Speaker 5>will be done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said no other word,</v>

2240
02:11:27.021 --> 02:11:32.021
<v Speaker 5>but took up what remained of the flesh </v>
<v Speaker 5>and went home intending I suppose to </v>

2241
02:11:32.021 --> 02:11:34.790
<v Speaker 5>bury all of it together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that was how Harper Gus was punished</v>

2242
02:11:35.300 --> 02:11:39.020
<v Speaker 5>and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If that had been in the Syrian record,</v>

2243
02:11:39.021 --> 02:11:41.680
<v Speaker 5>it would have said something like his </v>
<v Speaker 5>son.</v>

2244
02:11:41.690 --> 02:11:44.030
<v Speaker 5>I divided the pieces I fed to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2245
02:11:44.031 --> 02:11:45.860
<v Speaker 5>it would be a straightforward sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

2246
02:11:46.100 --> 02:11:49.400
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't have anybody setting up the</v>
<v Speaker 5>suspense of,</v>

2247
02:11:49.650 --> 02:11:52.010
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having him eat and not know what it is.</v>

2248
02:11:52.011 --> 02:11:55.400
<v Speaker 5>And then having the platter brought in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having the king asked the question,</v>

2249
02:11:55.401 --> 02:11:56.780
<v Speaker 5>do you know what you ate?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you like it?</v>

2250
02:11:56.781 --> 02:12:01.781
<v Speaker 5>And then the platters lifted up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean those moments where you set up </v>

2251
02:12:01.781 --> 02:12:03.710
<v Speaker 5>the tension and the drama,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a movie.</v>

2252
02:12:04.940 --> 02:12:08.630
<v Speaker 5>You could do that movie and change </v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing.</v>

2253
02:12:10.670 --> 02:12:13.700
<v Speaker 5>It's living color.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's more,</v>

2254
02:12:13.701 --> 02:12:18.701
<v Speaker 5>Heraclitus is clearly setting up these </v>
<v Speaker 5>moments for his audience to do the </v>

2255
02:12:18.701 --> 02:12:23.111
<v Speaker 5>equivalent of what we would do in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>movie theater when some great seen on </v>

2256
02:12:23.111 --> 02:12:25.190
<v Speaker 5>the screen happens that we're all really</v>
<v Speaker 5>glad to see and you clap or something.</v>

2257
02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:29.300
<v Speaker 5>He's got these moments because when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>make osteology out to be such a jerk,</v>

2258
02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:31.850
<v Speaker 5>when he gets what's coming to him in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>story,</v>

2259
02:12:31.851 --> 02:12:34.400
<v Speaker 5>it's a crowd pleaser.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then this story,</v>

2260
02:12:34.401 --> 02:12:39.401
<v Speaker 5>of course he does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And while it's tempting to think that </v>

2261
02:12:39.401 --> 02:12:41.210
<v Speaker 5>the entire thing is just a great tale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody great tale,</v>

2262
02:12:41.211 --> 02:12:46.211
<v Speaker 5>maybe not initially,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are definite facts mixed in and </v>

2263
02:12:46.211 --> 02:12:49.970
<v Speaker 5>you can see her test.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trying to explain the reasons behind the</v>

2264
02:12:49.971 --> 02:12:54.971
<v Speaker 5>facts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Today may be a screenwriter would call </v>

2265
02:12:54.971 --> 02:12:56.951
<v Speaker 5>it dramatic license because Babylonian </v>
<v Speaker 5>records indicate that there was a </v>

2266
02:12:58.551 --> 02:13:03.551
<v Speaker 5>general who corresponds to this heart </v>
<v Speaker 5>biggest guy and that that general was </v>

2267
02:13:04.041 --> 02:13:06.500
<v Speaker 5>involved in a battlefield.</v>

2268
02:13:07.250 --> 02:13:11.630
<v Speaker 5>Betrayal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe you could say in a key battle,</v>

2269
02:13:11.631 --> 02:13:15.350
<v Speaker 5>osteology has had a large part of his </v>
<v Speaker 5>army,</v>

2270
02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:19.010
<v Speaker 5>desert him on the battlefield and go to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the other side.</v>

2271
02:13:20.090 --> 02:13:25.090
<v Speaker 5>It very well may have been this heart </v>
<v Speaker 5>biggest person who led them to do that </v>

2272
02:13:26.090 --> 02:13:29.450
<v Speaker 5>and Hurghada test wants you to think </v>
<v Speaker 5>that see,</v>

2273
02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:32.880
<v Speaker 5>he was a jerk and now this is what he </v>
<v Speaker 5>gets,</v>

2274
02:13:32.881 --> 02:13:37.881
<v Speaker 5>and and who would think that you could </v>
<v Speaker 5>trust a man whose son you had served to </v>

2275
02:13:37.881 --> 02:13:39.990
<v Speaker 5>him for dinner with the entire army in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the first place,</v>

2276
02:13:39.991 --> 02:13:44.991
<v Speaker 5>but nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the moment when Harper guests and the </v>

2277
02:13:44.991 --> 02:13:45.960
<v Speaker 5>medes crossover to cyrus aside of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>battlefield,</v>

2278
02:13:45.961 --> 02:13:49.170
<v Speaker 5>must've been a crowd pleasing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>satisfying moment for the audience,</v>

2279
02:13:49.171 --> 02:13:51.810
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That jerk got what he deserved.</v>

2280
02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:54.960
<v Speaker 5>In the Babylonian records,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's much more stark,</v>

2281
02:13:54.961 --> 02:13:59.961
<v Speaker 5>as you might imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the texts from Babylon as quoted </v>

2282
02:13:59.961 --> 02:14:02.370
<v Speaker 5>by peer Briana reads,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

2283
02:14:03.060 --> 02:14:07.110
<v Speaker 5>osteology is mobilized his army and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>marched against Cyrus King.</v>

2284
02:14:07.110 --> 02:14:09.360
<v Speaker 5>Avant Sean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to conquer the army,</v>

2285
02:14:09.361 --> 02:14:12.270
<v Speaker 5>rebelled against osteology and he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>taken prisoner.</v>

2286
02:14:12.450 --> 02:14:16.580
<v Speaker 5>They handed him over to Cyrus Cyrus </v>
<v Speaker 5>march towards Batna,</v>

2287
02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:21.620
<v Speaker 5>the royal city and quote by 5:50</v>
<v Speaker 5>bce or thereabouts,</v>

2288
02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:28.100
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus and the Persians were basically in</v>
<v Speaker 5>control of the old Isla might </v>

2289
02:14:29.641 --> 02:14:34.641
<v Speaker 5>territories and now had inherited </v>
<v Speaker 5>control of the Medea and empire,</v>

2290
02:14:35.070 --> 02:14:40.070
<v Speaker 5>which was already one of the great </v>
<v Speaker 5>empires in this particular world stage.</v>

2291
02:14:41.700 --> 02:14:44.850
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of possible that the Lydian </v>
<v Speaker 5>King,</v>

2292
02:14:44.851 --> 02:14:49.260
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that in three years Cyrus will be at war</v>

2293
02:14:49.261 --> 02:14:54.261
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't even really have a key idea who </v>

2294
02:14:54.261 --> 02:14:54.261
<v Speaker 5>the Persians are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure,</v>

2295
02:14:54.261 --> 02:14:58.440
<v Speaker 5>but I mean judging from the sources,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is quite the turnaround.</v>

2296
02:14:58.860 --> 02:15:03.860
<v Speaker 5>And as I said in 5:47,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cyrus and the new Persian empire is </v>

2297
02:15:05.101 --> 02:15:10.101
<v Speaker 5>fighting those same people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The means were fighting when that </v>

2298
02:15:10.101 --> 02:15:10.101
<v Speaker 5>eclipse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2299
02:15:10.101 --> 02:15:11.310
<v Speaker 5>caused everyone to think that maybe they</v>
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't be fighting,</v>

2300
02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:17.060
<v Speaker 5>and it's a great story because the guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>who runs the lydian empire now at this </v>

2301
02:15:17.060 --> 02:15:18.270
<v Speaker 5>time is a guy named creases.</v>

2302
02:15:18.270 --> 02:15:21.480
<v Speaker 5>And there's a saying about him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You may have heard rich as creases,</v>

2303
02:15:21.930 --> 02:15:23.790
<v Speaker 5>and that's the stereotype of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Lydians.</v>

2304
02:15:23.791 --> 02:15:25.220
<v Speaker 5>At this time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2305
02:15:25.230 --> 02:15:30.230
<v Speaker 5>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're known as people who invented </v>

2306
02:15:30.230 --> 02:15:31.020
<v Speaker 5>metal coinage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't know if that's really true or not,</v>

2307
02:15:31.021 --> 02:15:34.920
<v Speaker 5>but that's their reputation and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>attached to them because they're thought</v>

2308
02:15:34.921 --> 02:15:39.921
<v Speaker 5>to be extremely wealthy and creases is </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to have gone to one of the </v>

2309
02:15:41.131 --> 02:15:45.450
<v Speaker 5>famous Oracle's maybe the most famous </v>
<v Speaker 5>oracle in the entire Greek world,</v>

2310
02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:50.960
<v Speaker 5>the Oracle at Delphi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which he may have been giving money to </v>

2311
02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:55.761
<v Speaker 5>influence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a whole big problem during </v>

2312
02:15:55.761 --> 02:15:56.490
<v Speaker 5>this period where some questioned the </v>
<v Speaker 5>reliability of these oracles.</v>

2313
02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:00.870
<v Speaker 5>Can you imagine a because of them taking</v>
<v Speaker 5>money to keep operating from people.</v>

2314
02:16:00.871 --> 02:16:05.871
<v Speaker 5>Increases was a bridge and he gave money</v>
<v Speaker 5>to everybody's a little Donald Trump </v>

2315
02:16:05.871 --> 02:16:05.871
<v Speaker 5>ish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you might say.</v>

2316
02:16:05.871 --> 02:16:06.430
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2317
02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:09.600
<v Speaker 5>asked the oracle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2318
02:16:09.601 --> 02:16:13.620
<v Speaker 5>now what would happen if I went to war </v>
<v Speaker 5>with the Persian empire?</v>

2319
02:16:14.610 --> 02:16:16.740
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>little sidetrack here,</v>

2320
02:16:16.770 --> 02:16:20.370
<v Speaker 5>maybe only worthwhile for the bedding </v>
<v Speaker 5>people amongst you,</v>

2321
02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:26.060
<v Speaker 5>but if you went to an advisor in Las </v>
<v Speaker 5>Vegas who gave you advice and you said,</v>

2322
02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:30.400
<v Speaker 5>will the Green Bay packers win the </v>
<v Speaker 5>superbowl?</v>

2323
02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:35.520
<v Speaker 5>And the answer was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if the Green Bay packers play in the </v>

2324
02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:37.180
<v Speaker 5>superbowl,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will add to a great legacy.</v>

2325
02:16:37.870 --> 02:16:42.850
<v Speaker 5>Do you bet?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Creases was told by the Oracle at Delphi</v>

2326
02:16:43.210 --> 02:16:47.830
<v Speaker 5>that have creases attacks the Persians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he will destroy a great empire.</v>

2327
02:16:48.910 --> 02:16:51.190
<v Speaker 5>You could take that a number of </v>
<v Speaker 5>different ways,</v>

2328
02:16:51.191 --> 02:16:53.500
<v Speaker 5>couldn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could say,</v>

2329
02:16:53.501 --> 02:16:55.270
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the greenbay packers are going to win.</v>

2330
02:16:55.271 --> 02:17:00.271
<v Speaker 5>Or You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen to the Dallas cowboys beat the </v>

2331
02:17:00.271 --> 02:17:03.660
<v Speaker 5>Green Bay packers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have added to a great championship </v>

2332
02:17:03.660 --> 02:17:07.321
<v Speaker 5>legacy too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just the Dallas cowboys </v>

2333
02:17:07.321 --> 02:17:09.760
<v Speaker 5>championship legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When creases and the lydians fight,</v>

2334
02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:13.270
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus and the Persians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he loses.</v>

2335
02:17:14.050 --> 02:17:18.160
<v Speaker 5>He destroys a great empire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The one that invented metal coinage.</v>

2336
02:17:19.390 --> 02:17:24.390
<v Speaker 5>I would love to get into the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>army that Cyrus had and what he used to </v>

2337
02:17:24.390 --> 02:17:25.690
<v Speaker 5>accomplish this victory over the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Lydians.</v>

2338
02:17:25.691 --> 02:17:30.691
<v Speaker 5>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the acumen and military system is not </v>

2339
02:17:30.691 --> 02:17:34.951
<v Speaker 5>well understood anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was only in the 19 eighties that </v>

2340
02:17:34.951 --> 02:17:38.190
<v Speaker 5>they started putting together realistic </v>
<v Speaker 5>reconstructions of the army in the days </v>

2341
02:17:38.190 --> 02:17:39.610
<v Speaker 5>that are much better known than this </v>
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>

2342
02:17:39.611 --> 02:17:44.611
<v Speaker 5>I mean during the Greek inversion wars </v>
<v Speaker 5>or after against Alexander in this </v>

2343
02:17:44.611 --> 02:17:47.941
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all conjecture what the heck cyrus </v>

2344
02:17:47.941 --> 02:17:47.941
<v Speaker 5>was using.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2345
02:17:47.941 --> 02:17:47.941
<v Speaker 5>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2346
02:17:47.941 --> 02:17:50.020
<v Speaker 5>he probably use this and it's logical to</v>
<v Speaker 5>assume that,</v>

2347
02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:51.340
<v Speaker 5>but nobody knows.</v>

2348
02:17:52.930 --> 02:17:57.170
<v Speaker 5>When you read Herodotus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's always got some little stratagem in</v>

2349
02:17:57.180 --> 02:18:02.180
<v Speaker 5>play that keeps you from having to know </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a really what the army was doing in </v>

2350
02:18:02.180 --> 02:18:02.290
<v Speaker 5>one of these big battles against </v>
<v Speaker 5>creases.</v>

2351
02:18:02.690 --> 02:18:07.690
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Persians were told we'll take their </v>

2352
02:18:07.690 --> 02:18:09.541
<v Speaker 5>baggage camels and take the baggage off </v>
<v Speaker 5>of them and put them in front of the </v>

2353
02:18:09.541 --> 02:18:12.340
<v Speaker 5>army so that when the Lydian horses </v>
<v Speaker 5>who've never seen camels right up to the</v>

2354
02:18:12.341 --> 02:18:14.110
<v Speaker 5>front,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll be scared off by the camels.</v>

2355
02:18:14.111 --> 02:18:14.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2356
02:18:14.471 --> 02:18:19.471
<v Speaker 5>you get a victory in the battle just </v>
<v Speaker 5>with that doesn't really help you know </v>

2357
02:18:19.471 --> 02:18:19.810
<v Speaker 5>much about an army that must've been </v>
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>

2358
02:18:19.811 --> 02:18:22.630
<v Speaker 5>really good to do all these things cyrus</v>
<v Speaker 5>was doing with it.</v>

2359
02:18:24.570 --> 02:18:28.080
<v Speaker 5>He does look like a very bold commander </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the sources.</v>

2360
02:18:28.081 --> 02:18:33.081
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the things he brought it just </v>

2361
02:18:33.081 --> 02:18:34.251
<v Speaker 5>talks about is this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shall we call it a misunderstanding </v>

2362
02:18:34.251 --> 02:18:37.761
<v Speaker 5>between creases and Cyrus after this big</v>
<v Speaker 5>battle that starts off the campaign and </v>

2363
02:18:37.761 --> 02:18:40.170
<v Speaker 5>it's bloody and inconclusive and </v>
<v Speaker 5>winter's coming,</v>

2364
02:18:40.171 --> 02:18:45.171
<v Speaker 5>so creases does with any ancient </v>
<v Speaker 5>commander would have done during that </v>

2365
02:18:45.171 --> 02:18:45.171
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He went home,</v>

2366
02:18:45.450 --> 02:18:50.450
<v Speaker 5>went to the capital at stardust,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this giant fortified city and dismissed </v>

2367
02:18:50.450 --> 02:18:52.830
<v Speaker 5>mercenaries and let most of the army go </v>
<v Speaker 5>home and told his allies,</v>

2368
02:18:53.310 --> 02:18:54.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in four months,</v>

2369
02:18:54.271 --> 02:18:57.300
<v Speaker 5>show up here and we'll deal with this </v>
<v Speaker 5>emerging Persian threat.</v>

2370
02:18:57.930 --> 02:18:58.830
<v Speaker 5>His allies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

2371
02:18:58.870 --> 02:18:59.730
<v Speaker 5>included,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2372
02:18:59.840 --> 02:19:02.430
<v Speaker 5>the great powers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Babylonia and Egypt.</v>

2373
02:19:02.431 --> 02:19:07.431
<v Speaker 5>So maybe cyrus was starting to be seen </v>
<v Speaker 5>as the destabilizing force in that </v>

2374
02:19:07.431 --> 02:19:11.280
<v Speaker 5>little geopolitical ecosystem in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>part of the world.</v>

2375
02:19:11.281 --> 02:19:14.820
<v Speaker 5>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus didn't disband the army.</v>

2376
02:19:15.300 --> 02:19:18.510
<v Speaker 5>He didn't go home for winter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He were told,</v>

2377
02:19:18.511 --> 02:19:20.280
<v Speaker 5>pursued the Lydians right on their </v>
<v Speaker 5>heels.</v>

2378
02:19:20.281 --> 02:19:25.281
<v Speaker 5>This is bald strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he forced another battle and were </v>

2379
02:19:25.281 --> 02:19:26.910
<v Speaker 5>told it was after creases had already </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically sent most of the people,</v>

2380
02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:30.010
<v Speaker 5>the Persians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not paddling.</v>

2381
02:19:30.020 --> 02:19:35.020
<v Speaker 5>That's the camel battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then they faced this monstrous </v>

2382
02:19:35.020 --> 02:19:38.491
<v Speaker 5>fortification at Sardis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The capital of Libya that could easily </v>

2383
02:19:38.491 --> 02:19:39.470
<v Speaker 5>hold out until all those allies show up </v>
<v Speaker 5>in four months,</v>

2384
02:19:39.471 --> 02:19:42.860
<v Speaker 5>you would think we're told it holds out </v>
<v Speaker 5>for like 14 days,</v>

2385
02:19:43.350 --> 02:19:48.350
<v Speaker 5>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have another story about a a back </v>

2386
02:19:48.350 --> 02:19:51.880
<v Speaker 5>path to the citadel being found by a </v>
<v Speaker 5>Persian who spies one of the guards.</v>

2387
02:19:52.581 --> 02:19:54.980
<v Speaker 5>Hats falling off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>helmets falling off in the guard,</v>

2388
02:19:54.981 --> 02:19:57.110
<v Speaker 5>retrieving it down some path.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

2389
02:19:57.800 --> 02:20:02.030
<v Speaker 5>you wouldn't know about what amazing </v>
<v Speaker 5>siege engines maybe cyrus had because we</v>

2390
02:20:02.031 --> 02:20:07.031
<v Speaker 5>always have some little story that </v>
<v Speaker 5>accounts for how one of the great </v>

2391
02:20:07.031 --> 02:20:09.140
<v Speaker 5>fortified cities in this part of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world gets taken in 14 days.</v>

2392
02:20:09.770 --> 02:20:14.770
<v Speaker 5>Nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We also get some accounts now of of of </v>

2393
02:20:14.770 --> 02:20:16.130
<v Speaker 5>something we've spoken about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>about how the Persians may be like darth</v>

2394
02:20:16.131 --> 02:20:21.131
<v Speaker 5>vader to the Greeks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they have something and and you </v>

2395
02:20:21.131 --> 02:20:24.071
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't know if you want to call this </v>

2396
02:20:24.071 --> 02:20:26.320
<v Speaker 5>propaganda or a sincere and clever and </v>
<v Speaker 5>common sense and realistic approach to </v>

2397
02:20:28.731 --> 02:20:31.130
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you could sort of take either way,</v>

2398
02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:36.580
<v Speaker 5>but shall we call it the tolerance bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're told Theodora stimulus,</v>

2399
02:20:37.071 --> 02:20:42.071
<v Speaker 5>especially mentions that cyrus gave a </v>
<v Speaker 5>deal to the lydians before this whole </v>

2400
02:20:42.071 --> 02:20:42.071
<v Speaker 5>thing started.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

2401
02:20:42.071 --> 02:20:46.901
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>submit to me and I'll leave you in </v>

2402
02:20:46.901 --> 02:20:47.810
<v Speaker 5>charge of this whole area.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's basically the same deal.</v>

2403
02:20:47.811 --> 02:20:50.570
<v Speaker 5>Xerxes offered the spartans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they're awfully,</v>

2404
02:20:50.610 --> 02:20:51.620
<v Speaker 5>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's make a deal.</v>

2405
02:20:51.621 --> 02:20:55.040
<v Speaker 5>Put down those weapons and not only will</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get to go home,</v>

2406
02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:56.900
<v Speaker 5>I'll put you in charge of all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

2407
02:20:56.901 --> 02:21:00.110
<v Speaker 5>You'll benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>submit and profit.</v>

2408
02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:05.200
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you could call this combination of</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of machiavellian thinking with a </v>

2409
02:21:07.521 --> 02:21:10.550
<v Speaker 5>sort of Gandhi like ethic that's going </v>
<v Speaker 5>too far,</v>

2410
02:21:10.551 --> 02:21:15.551
<v Speaker 5>but I love the connection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A realistic hardheaded knife in the </v>

2411
02:21:16.701 --> 02:21:21.701
<v Speaker 5>back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of diplomacy with tolerance and </v>

2412
02:21:21.701 --> 02:21:24.410
<v Speaker 5>mercy and leniency as your weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get a knife,</v>

2413
02:21:24.411 --> 02:21:29.411
<v Speaker 5>you with leniency and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would have to suggest perhaps that </v>

2414
02:21:30.321 --> 02:21:35.321
<v Speaker 5>there were two ways this lenient idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>could go either not work at all and then</v>

2415
02:21:35.901 --> 02:21:40.901
<v Speaker 5>you see why the Assyrians had to be as </v>
<v Speaker 5>harsh as they were or because the </v>

2416
02:21:40.901 --> 02:21:43.130
<v Speaker 5>Assyrians were as harsh as they were in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Babylonians who followed after them.</v>

2417
02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:48.290
<v Speaker 5>The area was ripe for somebody who would</v>
<v Speaker 5>offer.</v>

2418
02:21:48.380 --> 02:21:53.380
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if everybody was going to be under </v>

2419
02:21:53.380 --> 02:21:54.641
<v Speaker 5>somebody control,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when did you want to go with the </v>

2420
02:21:54.641 --> 02:21:55.760
<v Speaker 5>tolerant guy and remember we are grading</v>
<v Speaker 5>on a curve here.</v>

2421
02:21:56.090 --> 02:22:01.090
<v Speaker 5>When we talk about tolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Persians could be every bit as </v>

2422
02:22:01.090 --> 02:22:03.260
<v Speaker 5>atrocious as any other ancient people on</v>
<v Speaker 5>occasion.</v>

2423
02:22:03.620 --> 02:22:08.620
<v Speaker 5>It just seemed like once they took over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were a lot fewer of those </v>

2424
02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:12.101
<v Speaker 5>occasions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe the historians or some of them </v>

2425
02:22:12.101 --> 02:22:12.101
<v Speaker 5>that I grew up with would say something </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2426
02:22:12.101 --> 02:22:17.050
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's because the Assyrians already </v>

2427
02:22:17.050 --> 02:22:18.461
<v Speaker 5>broke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the troubles in people to the yoke </v>

2428
02:22:18.461 --> 02:22:20.171
<v Speaker 5>of Empire seems a bit far fetched.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Certainly you can say though that the </v>

2429
02:22:22.340 --> 02:22:27.340
<v Speaker 5>whole sort of mood and attitude was </v>
<v Speaker 5>altered and you don't get any more of </v>

2430
02:22:27.541 --> 02:22:31.050
<v Speaker 5>those really intimidating reliefs </v>
<v Speaker 5>showing things like,</v>

2431
02:22:31.340 --> 02:22:36.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>heads of your enemies staring up at you </v>

2432
02:22:36.340 --> 02:22:39.020
<v Speaker 5>or horrible violence or the flying of </v>
<v Speaker 5>live captives and you don't get the </v>

2433
02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:43.620
<v Speaker 5>writings where there's a boasting and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>propaganda value where you're saying,</v>

2434
02:22:43.621 --> 02:22:46.860
<v Speaker 5>this is what will happen to you if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>rebel against us.</v>

2435
02:22:47.310 --> 02:22:51.000
<v Speaker 5>Recess are gummy quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The SOM cylinder,</v>

2436
02:22:51.001 --> 02:22:52.680
<v Speaker 5>it's called and it's Osher,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bonnie Paul,</v>

2437
02:22:52.681 --> 02:22:57.090
<v Speaker 5>the last great king of Assyria,</v>
<v Speaker 5>boasting of what he did to Babylon after</v>

2438
02:22:57.091 --> 02:22:59.520
<v Speaker 5>his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who he put on the throne of Babylon,</v>

2439
02:22:59.521 --> 02:23:03.750
<v Speaker 5>rebelled against him in 6:49</v>
<v Speaker 5>bce.</v>

2440
02:23:04.140 --> 02:23:06.780
<v Speaker 5>First,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's besieged the people until they were</v>

2441
02:23:06.781 --> 02:23:09.810
<v Speaker 5>cannibalistic and then picks up the </v>
<v Speaker 5>narrative saying,</v>

2442
02:23:09.811 --> 02:23:10.230
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

2443
02:23:11.530 --> 02:23:16.530
<v Speaker 5>out of hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the flesh have their sons and daughters </v>

2444
02:23:16.530 --> 02:23:16.530
<v Speaker 5>they ate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Afterwards,</v>

2445
02:23:16.530 --> 02:23:19.210
<v Speaker 5>I ripped out the tongue of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>officers whose mouth said,</v>

2446
02:23:19.211 --> 02:23:21.880
<v Speaker 5>blast themed against Asher,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my master,</v>

2447
02:23:21.881 --> 02:23:25.180
<v Speaker 5>and then slaughtered them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Any soldiers found still alive,</v>

2448
02:23:25.330 --> 02:23:28.400
<v Speaker 5>were flogged in front of the wing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good bowls built by Senaca.</v>

2449
02:23:28.401 --> 02:23:33.401
<v Speaker 5>Rip My grandfather.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I whipped the Naca ribs tomb and then </v>

2450
02:23:33.401 --> 02:23:35.020
<v Speaker 5>tossed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're quivering flesh for the jackals,</v>

2451
02:23:35.021 --> 02:23:36.490
<v Speaker 5>the birds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the fish to eat.</v>

2452
02:23:36.730 --> 02:23:41.730
<v Speaker 5>In this way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I placated the wrath of the gods who </v>

2453
02:23:41.730 --> 02:23:42.550
<v Speaker 5>would become incensed by their ignominy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his deeds,</v>

2454
02:23:43.450 --> 02:23:46.810
<v Speaker 5>and then start gummy picks up the </v>
<v Speaker 5>narrative saying,</v>

2455
02:23:46.811 --> 02:23:51.811
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this grizzly passage related to events </v>

2456
02:23:51.811 --> 02:23:55.681
<v Speaker 5>that transpired in Babylon proceeds a </v>
<v Speaker 5>brief description of the restorative </v>

2457
02:23:55.681 --> 02:23:56.350
<v Speaker 5>work that Osher,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bonnie,</v>

2458
02:23:56.351 --> 02:24:01.351
<v Speaker 5>Paul undertook in that city that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Assyrian king was unabashed about </v>

2459
02:24:01.351 --> 02:24:05.731
<v Speaker 5>intertwining the account of his </v>
<v Speaker 5>brutality with that of his clemency </v>

2460
02:24:05.731 --> 02:24:10.410
<v Speaker 5>indicates that Mesopotamian royalty did </v>
<v Speaker 5>not frowned upon the infliction of </v>

2461
02:24:10.410 --> 02:24:12.400
<v Speaker 5>vicious reprisals against conquered </v>
<v Speaker 5>populations.</v>

2462
02:24:12.730 --> 02:24:17.730
<v Speaker 5>This attitude enabled the Assyrian and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Babylonian kings to base their policies </v>

2463
02:24:17.730 --> 02:24:22.501
<v Speaker 5>largely on terror.</v>
<v Speaker 5>During the two centuries proceeding </v>

2464
02:24:22.501 --> 02:24:24.730
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus's rise to power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Assyrians and Babylonians had sacked</v>

2465
02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:29.760
<v Speaker 5>nearly every major near eastern capital </v>
<v Speaker 5>and their preferred practices of </v>

2466
02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:31.660
<v Speaker 5>population,</v>
<v Speaker 5>deportation and kidnapping.</v>

2467
02:24:31.661 --> 02:24:36.661
<v Speaker 5>Sacred Images had deeply traumatized the</v>
<v Speaker 5>people of the ancient near east end </v>

2468
02:24:36.701 --> 02:24:38.770
<v Speaker 5>quote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>

2469
02:24:39.490 --> 02:24:43.420
<v Speaker 5>if you had ever wanted to find a winning</v>
<v Speaker 5>military strategy,</v>

2470
02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:48.960
<v Speaker 5>this might be the time where mercy </v>
<v Speaker 5>tolerance and being the cool conquerors </v>

2471
02:24:50.650 --> 02:24:52.030
<v Speaker 5>really worked in your favor.</v>

2472
02:24:53.880 --> 02:24:58.880
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus is the one who initiated this idea</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we're not going to impale everybody</v>

2473
02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:03.880
<v Speaker 5>and we're not going to fly them and </v>

02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:11.880
<v Speaker 5>pay your taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I may have some representatives in a </v>

2476
02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:13.030
<v Speaker 5>garrison in your city,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but life will be good.</v>

2477
02:25:13.031 --> 02:25:16.240
<v Speaker 5>This Persian deal was very seductive.</v>

2478
02:25:17.860 --> 02:25:22.660
<v Speaker 5>Now here's where the story begins to </v>
<v Speaker 5>dove tail with what we've already talked</v>

2479
02:25:22.661 --> 02:25:26.470
<v Speaker 5>about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The peoples that we spoke about,</v>

2480
02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:31.800
<v Speaker 5>these Greeks who were in Anatolia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of them spoke a language that was </v>

2481
02:25:31.811 --> 02:25:34.060
<v Speaker 5>called Ionian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they're often called Ionians,</v>

2482
02:25:34.061 --> 02:25:38.830
<v Speaker 5>but there were other types of Greeks </v>
<v Speaker 5>there to Asiatic Greeks is a term that's</v>

2483
02:25:38.831 --> 02:25:43.831
<v Speaker 5>sometimes used.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These people had been paying tribute to </v>

2484
02:25:43.831 --> 02:25:47.050
<v Speaker 5>creases and the Lydians and Cyrus had </v>
<v Speaker 5>gone to them before the war with creases</v>

2485
02:25:47.051 --> 02:25:48.340
<v Speaker 5>in the Lydians and said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

2486
02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:52.360
<v Speaker 5>how about you revolt against creases?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they said no,</v>

2487
02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:54.640
<v Speaker 5>and some of them fought on creases </v>
<v Speaker 5>aside.</v>

2488
02:25:54.641 --> 02:25:59.641
<v Speaker 5>So after Cyrus winds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the people in the region are coming </v>

2489
02:25:59.641 --> 02:25:59.641
<v Speaker 5>to him to kind of say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

2490
02:25:59.641 --> 02:26:00.370
<v Speaker 5>boss,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always wanted you to win.</v>

2491
02:26:00.371 --> 02:26:01.990
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad you're victorious.</v>

2492
02:26:01.991 --> 02:26:04.750
<v Speaker 5>And Dha in the case of these Greeks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they went to him and said,</v>

2493
02:26:04.751 --> 02:26:09.751
<v Speaker 5>can we have the same deal we had with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the lydians and cyrus gets mad at them.</v>

2494
02:26:09.881 --> 02:26:11.200
<v Speaker 5>We're told.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He basically says,</v>

2495
02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:14.080
<v Speaker 5>you could've had that deal if you join </v>
<v Speaker 5>me and didn't fight against me.</v>

2496
02:26:14.081 --> 02:26:19.081
<v Speaker 5>Now you want a special deal over all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>other people in this region who didn't </v>

2497
02:26:19.081 --> 02:26:19.081
<v Speaker 5>fight against me</v>

2498
02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:23.880
<v Speaker 5>and got mad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And those Greeks went back home,</v>

2499
02:26:23.900 --> 02:26:28.900
<v Speaker 5>had a big meeting amongst each other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>started rebuilding the walls of their </v>

2500
02:26:28.900 --> 02:26:32.661
<v Speaker 5>cities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which they had knocked down and you </v>

2501
02:26:32.661 --> 02:26:32.661
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as part of their deal with creases,</v>

2502
02:26:32.661 --> 02:26:34.350
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and put the word out for help.</v>

2503
02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:39.950
<v Speaker 5>And they sent word to the spartans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the spartans had also promised help </v>

2504
02:26:40.721 --> 02:26:45.450
<v Speaker 5>decrease this when he was in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Supposedly they were just getting in the</v>

2505
02:26:45.451 --> 02:26:47.040
<v Speaker 5>boats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting ready to go help.</v>

2506
02:26:47.041 --> 02:26:52.041
<v Speaker 5>When in 14 days the Lydian capital falls</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't give him enough time to get </v>

2507
02:26:52.041 --> 02:26:52.620
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now they get,</v>

2508
02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:54.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a very short period of time,</v>

2509
02:26:54.781 --> 02:26:58.410
<v Speaker 5>a second call for help.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this time from Greeks,</v>

2510
02:26:59.870 --> 02:27:01.910
<v Speaker 5>it's about the Persians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just like that last call,</v>

2511
02:27:01.911 --> 02:27:03.770
<v Speaker 5>these Persians must be a troublesome </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

2512
02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:07.430
<v Speaker 5>The spartans were a little busy when the</v>
<v Speaker 5>message came,</v>

2513
02:27:07.820 --> 02:27:11.510
<v Speaker 5>but they sent an emissary to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 5>this Persian.</v>

2514
02:27:11.511 --> 02:27:16.511
<v Speaker 5>Now every historian I'm reading is </v>
<v Speaker 5>assuming that these Persians and these </v>

2515
02:27:16.511 --> 02:27:20.701
<v Speaker 5>spartans do not know each other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that this may be the first time they </v>

2516
02:27:20.930 --> 02:27:25.930
<v Speaker 5>ever encounter one another.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems illogical considering all the </v>

2517
02:27:25.930 --> 02:27:29.420
<v Speaker 5>trading and whatnot going on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but let's understand best case scenario,</v>

2518
02:27:29.421 --> 02:27:32.480
<v Speaker 5>it's unusual and these people don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>really know each other,</v>

2519
02:27:32.720 --> 02:27:35.780
<v Speaker 5>and a spartan diplomat shows up in front</v>
<v Speaker 5>of Cyrus,</v>

2520
02:27:35.781 --> 02:27:40.781
<v Speaker 5>we're told,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we have one of these wonderful </v>

2521
02:27:40.781 --> 02:27:42.851
<v Speaker 5>periods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can imagine our Clint Eastwood type </v>

2522
02:27:44.271 --> 02:27:48.800
<v Speaker 5>figures showing up in front of this king</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the rise.</v>

2523
02:27:48.801 --> 02:27:53.801
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I try to imagine in Alexander the great </v>

2524
02:27:53.801 --> 02:27:56.141
<v Speaker 5>light like figure on the rise must've </v>
<v Speaker 5>been a pretty good looking guy because </v>

2525
02:27:56.391 --> 02:28:01.391
<v Speaker 5>we're told that the Persians standards </v>
<v Speaker 5>of beauty were modeled on him ever </v>

2526
02:28:01.391 --> 02:28:01.391
<v Speaker 5>afterwards.</v>

2527
02:28:03.350 --> 02:28:07.790
<v Speaker 5>This is the way Hurghada tests from my </v>
<v Speaker 5>purpose translation,</v>

2528
02:28:07.791 --> 02:28:12.791
<v Speaker 5>describes the diplomat talking to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>king of the Persians,</v>

2529
02:28:13.401 --> 02:28:18.401
<v Speaker 5>who conquered lydia and who's just about</v>
<v Speaker 5>to put the hammer down on the Greeks of </v>

2530
02:28:18.441 --> 02:28:20.660
<v Speaker 5>Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Herata says quote,</v>

2531
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:27.070
<v Speaker 5>and when they arrived at Ikea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they sent the most distinguished man </v>

2532
02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:30.251
<v Speaker 5>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>name latrines to Sardis to declare to </v>

2533
02:28:30.251 --> 02:28:32.861
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus in the name of the lack of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Simonian's that he must not inflict </v>

2534
02:28:32.861 --> 02:28:36.791
<v Speaker 5>reckless damage on any of the Greek </v>
<v Speaker 5>territory since the lack of Simonian's </v>

2535
02:28:36.791 --> 02:28:38.120
<v Speaker 5>would not tolerate it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember,</v>

2536
02:28:38.121 --> 02:28:40.340
<v Speaker 5>liking ammonium is another name for </v>
<v Speaker 5>spartans.</v>

2537
02:28:40.910 --> 02:28:45.910
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this people that Cyrus has never heard </v>

2538
02:28:45.910 --> 02:28:46.700
<v Speaker 5>of is just told him not to mess with any</v>
<v Speaker 5>of these people.</v>

2539
02:28:46.701 --> 02:28:51.701
<v Speaker 5>He just conquered and he basically turns</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the Greek advisor next to him and </v>

2540
02:28:51.701 --> 02:28:56.471
<v Speaker 5>says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who are these people and how many of </v>

2541
02:28:56.471 --> 02:28:57.110
<v Speaker 5>them are there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hirata to says quote.</v>

2542
02:28:57.650 --> 02:29:00.530
<v Speaker 5>They say that when the Herald had </v>
<v Speaker 5>delivered this message,</v>

2543
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:04.310
<v Speaker 5>cyrus question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Greeks who were with him asking them</v>

2544
02:29:04.490 --> 02:29:08.810
<v Speaker 5>who were these lack of pneumonia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who would send such a command to him and</v>

2545
02:29:08.811 --> 02:29:11.880
<v Speaker 5>how many of them were there when he </v>
<v Speaker 5>heard their response?</v>

2546
02:29:11.930 --> 02:29:15.020
<v Speaker 5>Hirata says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said to the Spartan Harold quote,</v>

2547
02:29:15.530 --> 02:29:20.530
<v Speaker 5>I have never yet feared any men who have</v>
<v Speaker 5>a place in the center of the city set </v>

2548
02:29:20.530 --> 02:29:25.511
<v Speaker 5>aside for meeting together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>swearing false oaths and cheating one </v>

2549
02:29:25.511 --> 02:29:26.720
<v Speaker 5>another,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if I live long enough,</v>

2550
02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:30.740
<v Speaker 5>lack of Simonian's will have troubles of</v>
<v Speaker 5>their own about which to converse rather</v>

2551
02:29:30.741 --> 02:29:34.610
<v Speaker 5>than those of the Ionians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hurghada test then says,</v>

2552
02:29:35.180 --> 02:29:40.180
<v Speaker 5>quote Cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thus insulted the Greeks because of </v>

2553
02:29:40.180 --> 02:29:43.481
<v Speaker 5>their custom of setting up a Gorillaz,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which are marketplaces in their cities </v>

2554
02:29:43.481 --> 02:29:46.610
<v Speaker 5>for the purpose of buying and selling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is unknown among the Persians,</v>

2555
02:29:46.611 --> 02:29:51.611
<v Speaker 5>who do not use markets and indeed have </v>
<v Speaker 5>no such place as an a gore in any of </v>

2556
02:29:51.611 --> 02:29:51.890
<v Speaker 5>their cities.</v>

2557
02:29:52.100 --> 02:29:57.080
<v Speaker 5>And to quote this is worth a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>digression for a second.</v>

2558
02:29:57.081 --> 02:29:58.970
<v Speaker 5>Just from an interest standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

2559
02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:02.900
<v Speaker 5>Hurghada tests would have probably known</v>
<v Speaker 5>what Persian cities were like.</v>

2560
02:30:03.080 --> 02:30:06.920
<v Speaker 5>He himself was an Ionian Greek or lived </v>
<v Speaker 5>in an Iranian Greek city.</v>

2561
02:30:06.921 --> 02:30:11.921
<v Speaker 5>He would have known this and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>fascinating when you consider that you </v>

2562
02:30:11.921 --> 02:30:15.131
<v Speaker 5>think of the Middle East now and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>think of the bazaars and the </v>

2563
02:30:15.131 --> 02:30:17.501
<v Speaker 5>marketplaces and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the Persians had this really </v>

2564
02:30:17.501 --> 02:30:21.140
<v Speaker 5>interesting cultural carrot and stick </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing going themselves.</v>

2565
02:30:21.141 --> 02:30:26.141
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've talked about the human laboratory </v>

2566
02:30:26.141 --> 02:30:26.141
<v Speaker 5>experiment a few times in this program,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the spartans for example.</v>

2567
02:30:26.540 --> 02:30:30.110
<v Speaker 5>The Persians had a different one going </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's fascinating to me.</v>

2568
02:30:30.500 --> 02:30:32.510
<v Speaker 5>Everything you read about them says </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2569
02:30:32.511 --> 02:30:34.460
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the top three things that,</v>

2570
02:30:34.461 --> 02:30:39.110
<v Speaker 5>that society places import on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of them is the truth.</v>

2571
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:41.990
<v Speaker 5>And the funny thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is in our world today,</v>

2572
02:30:41.991 --> 02:30:42.620
<v Speaker 5>we think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

2573
02:30:42.621 --> 02:30:43.970
<v Speaker 5>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody should tell the truth,</v>

2574
02:30:44.240 --> 02:30:49.240
<v Speaker 5>but what if you made this like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>commandment that people took ultra </v>

2575
02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:53.741
<v Speaker 5>seriously?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We told you earlier that when the </v>

2576
02:30:53.741 --> 02:30:53.741
<v Speaker 5>Spartan told xerxes about the Persians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>

2577
02:30:53.741 --> 02:30:54.770
<v Speaker 5>if I'm lying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2578
02:30:54.771 --> 02:30:59.771
<v Speaker 5>treat me like a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I told you that that's a death </v>

2579
02:30:59.771 --> 02:31:02.681
<v Speaker 5>penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Persians took lying really </v>

2580
02:31:02.681 --> 02:31:03.860
<v Speaker 5>seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're told that the education of Persian</v>

2581
02:31:03.861 --> 02:31:06.920
<v Speaker 5>male youth was to learn to ride,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to learn,</v>

2582
02:31:06.921 --> 02:31:08.510
<v Speaker 5>to shoot the bow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and to learn,</v>

2583
02:31:08.511 --> 02:31:11.240
<v Speaker 5>not to lie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to tell the truth.</v>

2584
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:17.590
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it fascinating to imagine a </v>
<v Speaker 5>society where this was both a state and </v>

2585
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:20.310
<v Speaker 5>legal requirement perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and certainly</v>

2586
02:31:20.400 --> 02:31:22.830
<v Speaker 5>a heavily,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2587
02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:25.710
<v Speaker 5>encouraged and incentivized cultural </v>
<v Speaker 5>norm.</v>

2588
02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:30.800
<v Speaker 5>Thou shalt not lie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It almost becomes like the plot to one </v>

2589
02:31:30.800 --> 02:31:30.800
<v Speaker 5>of those movies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2590
02:31:30.800 --> 02:31:33.660
<v Speaker 5>where the main character drink some </v>
<v Speaker 5>potion and all of a sudden,</v>

2591
02:31:33.820 --> 02:31:38.820
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is forced to tell the truth all the </v>

2592
02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:38.820
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if you had a society like that?</v>

2593
02:31:38.820 --> 02:31:40.530
<v Speaker 5>What what Cyrus is saying to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>spartans is,</v>

2594
02:31:40.531 --> 02:31:45.531
<v Speaker 5>I can't respect any people who have </v>
<v Speaker 5>these places in their cities set up </v>

2595
02:31:45.531 --> 02:31:47.400
<v Speaker 5>where people can specifically go to lie </v>
<v Speaker 5>to one another,</v>

2596
02:31:48.310 --> 02:31:50.230
<v Speaker 5>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>without going too deeply into it,</v>

2597
02:31:50.500 --> 02:31:55.500
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of connection to Persian </v>
<v Speaker 5>religious beliefs during this time </v>

2598
02:31:55.500 --> 02:31:58.891
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And how that plays into the question of </v>

2599
02:31:58.891 --> 02:32:01.240
<v Speaker 5>lying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Persians were worshipers of who were</v>

2600
02:32:01.241 --> 02:32:06.241
<v Speaker 5>a Mazda was a God's name and the old </v>
<v Speaker 5>needs used to worship a god named </v>

2601
02:32:06.241 --> 02:32:07.420
<v Speaker 5>Mithra.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's connections between good and</v>

2602
02:32:07.421 --> 02:32:11.200
<v Speaker 5>evil that some religious experts tied to</v>
<v Speaker 5>Christianity and ancient Judaism.</v>

2603
02:32:11.201 --> 02:32:12.490
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and who the heck knows?</v>

2604
02:32:12.491 --> 02:32:15.820
<v Speaker 5>All you know is that it's not just a </v>
<v Speaker 5>cultural and legal question,</v>

2605
02:32:15.821 --> 02:32:17.170
<v Speaker 5>it's a religious one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two,</v>

2606
02:32:17.860 --> 02:32:22.860
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting to speculate how much </v>
<v Speaker 5>people still lied in a society with that</v>

2607
02:32:23.531 --> 02:32:28.531
<v Speaker 5>many things favoring the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting to think about now </v>

2608
02:32:28.531 --> 02:32:30.160
<v Speaker 5>they're human laboratory experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you will,</v>

2609
02:32:30.161 --> 02:32:33.100
<v Speaker 5>the truthful society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And how realistic is that?</v>

2610
02:32:34.610 --> 02:32:39.610
<v Speaker 5>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have now set the stage for problems </v>

2611
02:32:39.771 --> 02:32:43.970
<v Speaker 5>between the Greeks and the Persians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>From this point on,</v>

2612
02:32:44.060 --> 02:32:46.580
<v Speaker 5>if you want to call it a clash of </v>
<v Speaker 5>civilizations,</v>

2613
02:32:46.581 --> 02:32:49.250
<v Speaker 5>you who have marketplaces in lie and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>who don't.</v>

2614
02:32:49.251 --> 02:32:52.190
<v Speaker 5>It's about to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lucky for the spartans.</v>

2615
02:32:52.191 --> 02:32:55.700
<v Speaker 5>They'll get to stay out of it for awhile</v>
<v Speaker 5>because Cyrus isn't done conquering yet.</v>

2616
02:32:55.820 --> 02:32:57.050
<v Speaker 5>Not by a long shot.</v>

2617
02:32:58.510 --> 02:33:03.510
<v Speaker 5>Historians still discuss whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 5>cyrus should be seen as an intentional,</v>

2618
02:33:05.231 --> 02:33:07.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a conscious conquer river.</v>

2619
02:33:07.100 --> 02:33:09.490
<v Speaker 5>Allah Alexander the great or Napoleon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2620
02:33:09.491 --> 02:33:14.491
<v Speaker 5>somebody who's sat down and said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to recreate the old Assyrian </v>

2621
02:33:14.491 --> 02:33:18.450
<v Speaker 5>Empire or somebody that got involved in </v>
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of conflicts each for their own </v>

2622
02:33:18.450 --> 02:33:19.090
<v Speaker 5>reason and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you,</v>

2623
02:33:19.091 --> 02:33:22.780
<v Speaker 5>when you take over their territory in </v>
<v Speaker 5>and kind of tripped into empire.</v>

2624
02:33:23.170 --> 02:33:24.910
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obviously that's a little simplistic,</v>

2625
02:33:25.450 --> 02:33:28.270
<v Speaker 5>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's indicative of how in,</v>

2626
02:33:28.300 --> 02:33:31.420
<v Speaker 5>in certain really key motivational </v>
<v Speaker 5>areas,</v>

2627
02:33:32.170 --> 02:33:34.060
<v Speaker 5>this guy is still a bit of a mystery.</v>

2628
02:33:35.970 --> 02:33:40.970
<v Speaker 5>He will disappear behind the veil of our</v>
<v Speaker 5>historical site,</v>

2629
02:33:41.011 --> 02:33:44.790
<v Speaker 5>I guess you could say for several years </v>
<v Speaker 5>after his.</v>

2630
02:33:44.791 --> 02:33:49.791
<v Speaker 5>I'm taking over of Lydia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he will leave a general who may be this </v>

2631
02:33:49.791 --> 02:33:53.520
<v Speaker 5>historical heart biggest guy and an army</v>
<v Speaker 5>behind in western Turkey,</v>

2632
02:33:53.521 --> 02:33:58.410
<v Speaker 5>what's now modern day western Turkey to </v>
<v Speaker 5>reduce these Asiatic Greek cities.</v>

2633
02:33:59.190 --> 02:34:04.190
<v Speaker 5>And he will go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's assumed to the eastern part of his </v>

2634
02:34:04.190 --> 02:34:09.021
<v Speaker 5>realm and the northern part of his realm</v>
<v Speaker 5>and conquer further and also shore up </v>

2635
02:34:09.871 --> 02:34:14.790
<v Speaker 5>his defenses against the many powerful </v>
<v Speaker 5>tribes that sort of ring his territory.</v>

2636
02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:20.110
<v Speaker 5>Probably a combination of fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of them showing the flag to some of</v>

2637
02:34:20.111 --> 02:34:25.111
<v Speaker 5>them are intermarrying and making </v>
<v Speaker 5>diplomatic agreements with some of them </v>

2638
02:34:25.111 --> 02:34:28.690
<v Speaker 5>accepting vassalage from others.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it was years of work.</v>

2639
02:34:29.110 --> 02:34:34.110
<v Speaker 5>So this guy is doing the Yeoman's work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the hard slogging of creating a stable </v>

2640
02:34:35.231 --> 02:34:40.231
<v Speaker 5>state and that requires years of </v>
<v Speaker 5>constant effort and he disappears from </v>

2641
02:34:40.231 --> 02:34:40.600
<v Speaker 5>the historical record while he's doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

2642
02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:44.920
<v Speaker 5>And then in 5:39</v>
<v Speaker 5>bce,</v>

2643
02:34:45.370 --> 02:34:50.350
<v Speaker 5>he reappears again at the head of an </v>
<v Speaker 5>army heading toward Babylon.</v>

2644
02:34:52.090 --> 02:34:57.090
<v Speaker 5>Now what Cyrus is going to do to Babylon</v>
<v Speaker 5>is probably his crowning achievement in </v>

2645
02:34:57.161 --> 02:35:01.300
<v Speaker 5>his career and I have to remind myself </v>
<v Speaker 5>that his career is already incredible.</v>

2646
02:35:01.960 --> 02:35:06.960
<v Speaker 5>This is a guy who by 5:39</v>
<v Speaker 5>bce has been a king for about 20 years </v>

2647
02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:10.390
<v Speaker 5>and in 20 years he's taken this people </v>
<v Speaker 5>from a virtual,</v>

2648
02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:13.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>backwater Nowheresville to a point where</v>

2649
02:35:13.571 --> 02:35:18.571
<v Speaker 5>they've conquered half of the great </v>
<v Speaker 5>nation states in their little ecosystem </v>

2650
02:35:18.571 --> 02:35:18.571
<v Speaker 5>that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2651
02:35:18.580 --> 02:35:23.580
<v Speaker 5>after the fall of Assyria.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's outside the gates of number </v>

2652
02:35:23.580 --> 02:35:27.960
<v Speaker 5>three of four with an army.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty awesome right there for a </v>

2653
02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:32.130
<v Speaker 5>king of an Sean who will very soon be </v>
<v Speaker 5>referring to himself as part of his </v>

2654
02:35:32.831 --> 02:35:35.860
<v Speaker 5>official royal titles as the King of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>universe.</v>

2655
02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:38.620
<v Speaker 5>When you go from an Sean to King of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>universe,</v>

2656
02:35:38.621 --> 02:35:41.260
<v Speaker 5>that's quite a jump and he's kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>self made conqueror.</v>

2657
02:35:41.410 --> 02:35:46.410
<v Speaker 5>You compare him to someone like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Alexander the great who is of course </v>

2658
02:35:46.410 --> 02:35:49.231
<v Speaker 5>awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Alexander reminds you of sort of a </v>

2659
02:35:49.231 --> 02:35:52.591
<v Speaker 5>historical rich kid who inherits his </v>
<v Speaker 5>father's already thriving corporation </v>

2660
02:35:52.601 --> 02:35:55.180
<v Speaker 5>with tons of ready cash and does great </v>
<v Speaker 5>things with it.</v>

2661
02:35:55.630 --> 02:35:58.000
<v Speaker 5>No offense to Alexander,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's awesome,</v>

2662
02:35:58.870 --> 02:36:03.870
<v Speaker 5>but Cyrus never had any of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>advantages and look where he is only 20 </v>

2663
02:36:03.870 --> 02:36:07.741
<v Speaker 5>years into his reign.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now let me just voice my own opinion </v>

2664
02:36:07.741 --> 02:36:11.860
<v Speaker 5>that that what Cyrus is about to do to </v>
<v Speaker 5>Babylon is strange.</v>

2665
02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:15.400
<v Speaker 5>You can't tell what the sources,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's really going on and the different</v>

2666
02:36:15.401 --> 02:36:20.401
<v Speaker 5>histories have different approaches to </v>
<v Speaker 5>it and it's been argued about and and </v>

2667
02:36:20.401 --> 02:36:20.980
<v Speaker 5>the views have changed and updated over </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2668
02:36:21.220 --> 02:36:26.220
<v Speaker 5>There's just not enough hard sources </v>
<v Speaker 5>though for anyone to really know for </v>

2669
02:36:26.220 --> 02:36:30.121
<v Speaker 5>anyone to conclusively when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>certainly not going to take a position </v>

2670
02:36:30.121 --> 02:36:33.991
<v Speaker 5>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I am going to explain sort of the </v>

2671
02:36:33.991 --> 02:36:33.991
<v Speaker 5>weirdness of it.</v>

2672
02:36:33.991 --> 02:36:36.990
<v Speaker 5>The first thing you have to ask is </v>
<v Speaker 5>whether or not cyrus arriving outside </v>

2673
02:36:37.001 --> 02:36:42.001
<v Speaker 5>Babylon when he did was a coincidence </v>
<v Speaker 5>because the timing is awesome if you're </v>

2674
02:36:42.001 --> 02:36:45.760
<v Speaker 5>hoping to take over Babylon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that just because he gets lucky or is</v>

2675
02:36:45.761 --> 02:36:50.761
<v Speaker 5>that just because of the Babylonian </v>
<v Speaker 5>propaganda would say later the hand of </v>

2676
02:36:50.761 --> 02:36:54.241
<v Speaker 5>Marduk had seized him and brought him to</v>
<v Speaker 5>Babylon to get rid of the horrible king </v>

2677
02:36:54.241 --> 02:36:58.591
<v Speaker 5>of Babylon and restore things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just lucky or did Cyrus and the Persians</v>

2678
02:36:59.801 --> 02:37:03.250
<v Speaker 5>have advanced information that things </v>
<v Speaker 5>suck in Babylon right now?</v>

2679
02:37:03.370 --> 02:37:08.370
<v Speaker 5>You come now and half the population </v>
<v Speaker 5>will be ready to welcome me with open </v>

2680
02:37:08.370 --> 02:37:12.391
<v Speaker 5>arms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was that may be part of the reason he </v>

2681
02:37:12.391 --> 02:37:13.120
<v Speaker 5>showed up when he did or as some have </v>
<v Speaker 5>argued for years.</v>

2682
02:37:13.150 --> 02:37:16.610
<v Speaker 5>Could you make a case that the reason </v>
<v Speaker 5>that people were so disaffected</v>

2683
02:37:16.610 --> 02:37:21.380
<v Speaker 2>in Babylon was in part due to Persian </v>
<v Speaker 2>propaganda that undermined it?</v>

2684
02:37:22.180 --> 02:37:25.430
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire wheel to resist and I have to</v>

2685
02:37:25.431 --> 02:37:30.431
<v Speaker 2>be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not understand that part of the </v>

2686
02:37:30.431 --> 02:37:33.071
<v Speaker 2>story for years growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but something has changed in the way </v>

2687
02:37:33.071 --> 02:37:33.071
<v Speaker 2>historian's view it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now makes more sense to me.</v>

2688
02:37:33.350 --> 02:37:35.660
<v Speaker 2>When I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the attitude was that in 5:39</v>

2689
02:37:35.661 --> 02:37:37.700
<v Speaker 2>BC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was when Cyrus arrived.</v>

2690
02:37:38.030 --> 02:37:43.030
<v Speaker 2>So something happens and occurs in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Babylon falls and Cyrus takes it over </v>

2691
02:37:43.030 --> 02:37:44.510
<v Speaker 2>and there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this idea that he had this propaganda</v>

2692
02:37:44.511 --> 02:37:48.050
<v Speaker 2>undermining Babylon made you think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

2693
02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:53.680
<v Speaker 2>when was that going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just everything happened so </v>

2694
02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:53.780
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The modern way of viewing this amongst a</v>

2695
02:37:53.781 --> 02:37:58.781
<v Speaker 2>lot of historians is that may be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Persians in the Babylonians had been </v>

2696
02:37:58.781 --> 02:38:00.380
<v Speaker 2>fighting battles for a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that in 5:39</v>

2697
02:38:00.381 --> 02:38:03.230
<v Speaker 2>when Cyrus in his army show up outside </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Babylon,</v>

2698
02:38:03.620 --> 02:38:06.770
<v Speaker 2>that's like the end of the Second World </v>
<v Speaker 2>War when the Russians show up outside of</v>

2699
02:38:06.771 --> 02:38:09.290
<v Speaker 2>Berlin and you're having your last </v>
<v Speaker 2>climactic battle,</v>

2700
02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:11.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a multi battle long war.</v>

2701
02:38:12.590 --> 02:38:17.590
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sources are just not there to </v>

2702
02:38:17.590 --> 02:38:17.590
<v Speaker 2>confirm any of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2703
02:38:17.590 --> 02:38:21.790
<v Speaker 2>categorically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it would make a heck of a lot more </v>

2704
02:38:21.790 --> 02:38:24.461
<v Speaker 2>sense if you were saying that Cyrus and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Persians were undermining the </v>

2705
02:38:24.461 --> 02:38:27.011
<v Speaker 2>Babylonians with propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had years to do it right now,</v>

2706
02:38:27.081 --> 02:38:32.081
<v Speaker 2>understanding what Cyrus might've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing requires talking about Babylon </v>

2707
02:38:32.081 --> 02:38:34.130
<v Speaker 2>itself a little bit like the Assyrian </v>
<v Speaker 2>city of Nineveh.</v>

2708
02:38:34.640 --> 02:38:39.640
<v Speaker 2>This is a great urban center and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>large enough and complex enough so that </v>

2709
02:38:39.681 --> 02:38:42.620
<v Speaker 2>you see a lot of the same sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamics going on.</v>

2710
02:38:43.010 --> 02:38:48.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be it through an ancient lens that </v>

2711
02:38:48.010 --> 02:38:48.010
<v Speaker 2>you would see in any modern large city </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

2712
02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:51.050
<v Speaker 2>There are fissures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are divisions,</v>

2713
02:38:51.350 --> 02:38:55.100
<v Speaker 2>there are tensions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are disagreements there.</v>

2714
02:38:55.101 --> 02:38:57.740
<v Speaker 2>There are all sorts of things that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone wanted to come in,</v>

2715
02:38:57.741 --> 02:39:02.741
<v Speaker 2>they could widen the disagreements and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's slowly but surely increase the </v>

2716
02:39:02.741 --> 02:39:05.510
<v Speaker 2>level of anger and discontent.</v>

2717
02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:08.750
<v Speaker 2>There's a number of things to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploited.</v>

2718
02:39:08.751 --> 02:39:12.980
<v Speaker 2>To start with the fact that the king is </v>
<v Speaker 2>unpopular.</v>

2719
02:39:14.150 --> 02:39:19.150
<v Speaker 2>The king of Babylon during this time </v>
<v Speaker 2>period almost certainly suffers from </v>

2720
02:39:19.150 --> 02:39:21.590
<v Speaker 2>from bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad historical publicity.</v>

2721
02:39:21.591 --> 02:39:26.591
<v Speaker 2>His name is nab Unitus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the time all of this is going </v>

2722
02:39:26.591 --> 02:39:26.591
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nab and I.</v>

2723
02:39:26.591 --> 02:39:30.770
<v Speaker 2>This is about 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 years old in a world,</v>

2724
02:39:31.350 --> 02:39:33.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the lifespan is so much shorter.</v>

2725
02:39:33.650 --> 02:39:37.730
<v Speaker 2>How many 70 year old people are there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like a wizard,</v>

2726
02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:43.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the population in terms of this is a </v>

2727
02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:45.431
<v Speaker 2>guy whose memory goes back to events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people can't get anywhere near </v>

2728
02:39:45.431 --> 02:39:50.280
<v Speaker 2>memory wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He may have been the general who helped </v>

2729
02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:52.730
<v Speaker 2>seal the deal between those two sides at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the battle of the eclipse.</v>

2730
02:39:52.731 --> 02:39:55.600
<v Speaker 2>Remember when they suck each other's </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood as part of a,</v>

2731
02:39:55.830 --> 02:39:56.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sealing the deal.</v>

2732
02:39:56.871 --> 02:39:57.290
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2733
02:39:57.440 --> 02:40:02.440
<v Speaker 2>this nab unitus guy when he was much </v>
<v Speaker 2>younger and more vigorous may have been </v>

2734
02:40:02.440 --> 02:40:05.621
<v Speaker 2>one of the generals on site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he's old and it's really hard to get</v>

2735
02:40:06.081 --> 02:40:08.330
<v Speaker 2>your mind around what this guy was </v>
<v Speaker 2>really like.</v>

2736
02:40:09.560 --> 02:40:14.560
<v Speaker 2>He sort of portrayed as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a kind of a doting antiquarian</v>

2737
02:40:15.390 --> 02:40:20.390
<v Speaker 5>by some historians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people consider him the first </v>

2738
02:40:20.390 --> 02:40:23.631
<v Speaker 5>official archeologist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's got to be crazy because </v>

2739
02:40:23.631 --> 02:40:23.880
<v Speaker 5>because there were lots of earlier kings</v>
<v Speaker 5>who were into digging up,</v>

2740
02:40:24.090 --> 02:40:26.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>earlier versions of their civilization.</v>

2741
02:40:26.281 --> 02:40:30.630
<v Speaker 5>But this guy is portrayed as somebody </v>
<v Speaker 5>who almost prefers it to being a king.</v>

2742
02:40:30.631 --> 02:40:33.300
<v Speaker 5>He'd rather be out there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Indiana Jonesing,</v>

2743
02:40:33.630 --> 02:40:37.830
<v Speaker 5>some old Babylonian stuff from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>previous kings and then dealing with the</v>

2744
02:40:37.831 --> 02:40:38.850
<v Speaker 5>day to day government.</v>

2745
02:40:40.490 --> 02:40:44.030
<v Speaker 5>He also looks like a guy who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>mind getting out of Babylon.</v>

2746
02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:49.630
<v Speaker 5>I have this image for the movie of some </v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to use like the guy who played </v>

2747
02:40:49.630 --> 02:40:50.330
<v Speaker 5>the the scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the doctor,</v>

2748
02:40:50.331 --> 02:40:55.331
<v Speaker 5>and back to the future and have him be </v>
<v Speaker 5>nab rhinitis and just have him sort of </v>

2749
02:40:55.331 --> 02:40:58.070
<v Speaker 5>did finding the hustle and bustle of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Babylon too much in those young kids and</v>

2750
02:40:58.071 --> 02:41:03.071
<v Speaker 5>they're loud music and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he and the priesthood of Babylon,</v>

2751
02:41:04.250 --> 02:41:09.250
<v Speaker 5>especially the main important God Marduk</v>
<v Speaker 5>begin to have these disagreements.</v>

2752
02:41:10.430 --> 02:41:13.760
<v Speaker 5>Now understand something in the world </v>
<v Speaker 5>before modern times.</v>

2753
02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:19.000
<v Speaker 5>There is really only one reliable </v>
<v Speaker 5>counterbalance to the power of a king or</v>

2754
02:41:19.011 --> 02:41:20.540
<v Speaker 5>an emperor pharaoh.</v>

2755
02:41:21.810 --> 02:41:26.810
<v Speaker 5>And that's the priesthood and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>religion because the power that that </v>

2756
02:41:26.810 --> 02:41:28.800
<v Speaker 5>they have stems from the same source,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2757
02:41:28.801 --> 02:41:30.150
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're king by divine,</v>

2758
02:41:30.151 --> 02:41:32.100
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the gods who want you to be a king,</v>

2759
02:41:32.580 --> 02:41:37.580
<v Speaker 5>but who has a special relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the gods and who helps placate the gods </v>

2760
02:41:37.580 --> 02:41:41.311
<v Speaker 5>and who does the work of the Gods and </v>
<v Speaker 5>who knows what the God really wants </v>

2761
02:41:41.311 --> 02:41:41.311
<v Speaker 5>while the priesthood and the religion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2762
02:41:41.311 --> 02:41:45.471
<v Speaker 5>So the only other source of legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 5>power in these societies before modern </v>

2763
02:41:46.711 --> 02:41:51.711
<v Speaker 5>times are often,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the priest and the priest and </v>

2764
02:41:51.711 --> 02:41:51.711
<v Speaker 5>Martech don't like this nab.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tonight is guy,</v>

2765
02:41:51.711 --> 02:41:55.971
<v Speaker 5>and part of the reason why is he seems </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be kind of will favoring another God </v>

2766
02:41:56.910 --> 02:41:57.790
<v Speaker 5>over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's.</v>

2767
02:41:58.890 --> 02:42:03.890
<v Speaker 5>This is what I mean by it's hard to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>your mind around Nabonidus because he </v>

2768
02:42:03.890 --> 02:42:05.310
<v Speaker 5>may be like an [inaudible] type </v>
<v Speaker 5>character.</v>

2769
02:42:05.311 --> 02:42:10.311
<v Speaker 5>You know the Egyptian Pharaoh that may </v>
<v Speaker 5>have been a monotheist and may have </v>

2770
02:42:10.311 --> 02:42:10.530
<v Speaker 5>tried to change Egypt's religion.</v>

2771
02:42:10.950 --> 02:42:12.270
<v Speaker 5>Another similar story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2772
02:42:12.271 --> 02:42:17.271
<v Speaker 5>Where you have the autocratic ruler </v>
<v Speaker 5>opposed by a powerful priesthood and </v>

2773
02:42:17.340 --> 02:42:22.340
<v Speaker 5>after Aka not died,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things returned back to normal and they </v>

2774
02:42:22.340 --> 02:42:22.340
<v Speaker 5>kind of were carving his face off of all</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the old things.</v>

2775
02:42:22.340 --> 02:42:23.940
<v Speaker 5>Trying to forget he ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

2776
02:42:23.941 --> 02:42:26.370
<v Speaker 5>urbanite is may have been one of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys to the one of the change,</v>

2777
02:42:26.371 --> 02:42:30.540
<v Speaker 5>the religion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His mother was supposedly a priestess of</v>

2778
02:42:30.541 --> 02:42:33.930
<v Speaker 5>a religion devoted to a god named sin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a Moon God,</v>

2779
02:42:34.980 --> 02:42:37.230
<v Speaker 5>and so nab tonight is right before this </v>
<v Speaker 5>time period,</v>

2780
02:42:37.231 --> 02:42:42.231
<v Speaker 5>gives the ultimate middle finger to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>priesthood of Marduk by leaving Babylon </v>

2781
02:42:43.231 --> 02:42:45.960
<v Speaker 5>and going to some Arabian oasis.</v>

2782
02:42:47.470 --> 02:42:52.470
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>historians in modern times if found all </v>

2783
02:42:52.470 --> 02:42:54.400
<v Speaker 5>sorts of really good logical patriotic </v>
<v Speaker 5>reasons why the king might do that.</v>

2784
02:42:54.430 --> 02:42:58.180
<v Speaker 5>In past times it was much more portrayed</v>
<v Speaker 5>like this guy is a mystic,</v>

2785
02:42:58.990 --> 02:43:03.280
<v Speaker 5>either a mystic or an old man or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>combination of the two and he just wants</v>

2786
02:43:03.281 --> 02:43:08.281
<v Speaker 5>to get away from is unworthy people and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he appreciates it more in these Arabian </v>

2787
02:43:08.281 --> 02:43:12.601
<v Speaker 5>oasis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's probably what modern historians </v>

2788
02:43:12.601 --> 02:43:12.601
<v Speaker 5>think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's probably,</v>

2789
02:43:12.601 --> 02:43:12.670
<v Speaker 5>they're doing important work for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>country,</v>

2790
02:43:12.671 --> 02:43:15.580
<v Speaker 5>but he's missing important work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the same time,</v>

2791
02:43:16.330 --> 02:43:21.330
<v Speaker 5>the Babylonians required their king to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be there once a year for a New Year's </v>

2792
02:43:21.330 --> 02:43:25.141
<v Speaker 5>festival.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was important he had to physically </v>

2793
02:43:25.141 --> 02:43:27.721
<v Speaker 5>grasp the hand of the God in front of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the population once a year to ensure </v>

2794
02:43:27.721 --> 02:43:32.310
<v Speaker 5>success and good things and all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>kinds of deals and he stayed away for </v>

2795
02:43:32.310 --> 02:43:35.881
<v Speaker 5>like a decade on the Babylonian records </v>
<v Speaker 5>will say every year the king was not </v>

2796
02:43:35.881 --> 02:43:40.591
<v Speaker 5>here for the ceremony or what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're getting pissed that he's </v>

2797
02:43:40.591 --> 02:43:43.630
<v Speaker 5>putting more money into creating more of</v>
<v Speaker 5>these temples for the other religion,</v>

2798
02:43:43.720 --> 02:43:48.720
<v Speaker 5>denying some money that the people of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Marduk expect and and you can just see </v>

2799
02:43:48.720 --> 02:43:48.820
<v Speaker 5>it boiling over.</v>

2800
02:43:48.820 --> 02:43:50.710
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the kings not even there.</v>

2801
02:43:50.860 --> 02:43:55.150
<v Speaker 5>His son Belshazzar is ruling as a region</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's not popular either,</v>

2802
02:43:56.230 --> 02:44:01.230
<v Speaker 5>so the king is part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Babylon is going through tough </v>

2803
02:44:01.230 --> 02:44:04.090
<v Speaker 5>economic times two and that's putting </v>
<v Speaker 5>the squeeze on people.</v>

2804
02:44:04.091 --> 02:44:06.760
<v Speaker 5>They're having problems with disease and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's causing unrest.</v>

2805
02:44:07.570 --> 02:44:10.420
<v Speaker 5>Archeologists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dr Joan oats describes,</v>

2806
02:44:10.830 --> 02:44:13.030
<v Speaker 5>you know the down and dirty parts of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

2807
02:44:13.130 --> 02:44:15.190
<v Speaker 5>of day to day suffering and let's </v>
<v Speaker 5>remember something.</v>

2808
02:44:15.191 --> 02:44:19.210
<v Speaker 5>Babylon's banking system and financial </v>
<v Speaker 5>system was developed enough so that they</v>

2809
02:44:19.211 --> 02:44:24.211
<v Speaker 5>had great banking houses there that were</v>
<v Speaker 5>very powerful and lived on long after </v>

2810
02:44:24.211 --> 02:44:28.921
<v Speaker 5>this period and the end,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's just another one of those </v>

2811
02:44:28.921 --> 02:44:29.560
<v Speaker 5>dynamics that makes us think about </v>
<v Speaker 5>modern times.</v>

2812
02:44:29.561 --> 02:44:33.580
<v Speaker 5>These are powerful interests that have </v>
<v Speaker 5>some authority in the state.</v>

2813
02:44:34.030 --> 02:44:39.030
<v Speaker 5>What happens when things seemed to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>falling apart and people are losing </v>

2814
02:44:39.030 --> 02:44:42.121
<v Speaker 5>money and times are bad and and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>start getting Persian propaganda about </v>

2815
02:44:42.121 --> 02:44:44.440
<v Speaker 5>this king who sounds like things are </v>
<v Speaker 5>going his way,</v>

2816
02:44:44.441 --> 02:44:49.441
<v Speaker 5>which remember during this time period </v>
<v Speaker 5>might have caused a lot of people to </v>

2817
02:44:49.441 --> 02:44:52.501
<v Speaker 5>figure the gods are smiling on that guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>and our kings not even showing up to </v>

2818
02:44:52.501 --> 02:44:53.770
<v Speaker 5>shake the God's hand every New Year's.</v>

2819
02:44:53.770 --> 02:44:58.770
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's the way Dr Joan oats describes </v>

2820
02:44:58.770 --> 02:45:01.321
<v Speaker 5>the situation in Babylon considering </v>
<v Speaker 5>also remember that this king looks like </v>

2821
02:45:01.321 --> 02:45:02.890
<v Speaker 5>a guy who's trying to change religious </v>
<v Speaker 5>traditions,</v>

2822
02:45:02.891 --> 02:45:04.240
<v Speaker 5>trying to change a bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

2823
02:45:04.300 --> 02:45:05.440
<v Speaker 5>and Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 5>oates writes,</v>

2824
02:45:05.441 --> 02:45:10.441
<v Speaker 5>quote clearly Nabil [inaudible] is </v>
<v Speaker 5>religious and administrative reforms </v>

2825
02:45:10.441 --> 02:45:15.330
<v Speaker 5>provoked great resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>While the wars and extensive building </v>

2826
02:45:15.330 --> 02:45:19.021
<v Speaker 5>programs of his predecessors had proved </v>
<v Speaker 5>a severe burden on the country's </v>

2827
02:45:19.021 --> 02:45:22.951
<v Speaker 5>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 5>large numbers of economic texts reveal </v>

2828
02:45:22.951 --> 02:45:24.670
<v Speaker 5>severe inflation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A situation now made worse by the spread</v>

2829
02:45:24.671 --> 02:45:28.340
<v Speaker 5>of plague between five slash 60 bce and </v>
<v Speaker 5>5:50</v>

2830
02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:32.170
<v Speaker 5>bce,</v>
<v Speaker 5>prices rose by up to 50 percent and from</v>

2831
02:45:32.171 --> 02:45:34.450
<v Speaker 5>five 62,</v>
<v Speaker 5>four 85 bce,</v>

2832
02:45:34.451 --> 02:45:39.451
<v Speaker 5>the total increase amount of some 200 </v>
<v Speaker 5>percent and not just that,</v>

2833
02:45:40.780 --> 02:45:42.670
<v Speaker 5>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take this with a grain of salt.</v>

2834
02:45:42.671 --> 02:45:47.671
<v Speaker 5>It's argued about but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there are people inside Babylon who </v>

2835
02:45:47.671 --> 02:45:49.600
<v Speaker 5>might be considered,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shall we say,</v>

2836
02:45:49.630 --> 02:45:54.190
<v Speaker 5>vulnerable to propaganda that created </v>
<v Speaker 5>descent.</v>

2837
02:45:54.910 --> 02:45:59.910
<v Speaker 5>There are a lot of people in Babylon who</v>
<v Speaker 5>are there because they were forcibly </v>

2838
02:45:59.910 --> 02:46:04.621
<v Speaker 5>taken once upon a time from where they </v>
<v Speaker 5>came from and some of the propaganda </v>

2839
02:46:06.670 --> 02:46:08.680
<v Speaker 5>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Certainly the post,</v>

2840
02:46:09.380 --> 02:46:09.980
<v Speaker 5>but maybe some</v>

2841
02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:14.980
<v Speaker 2>of the pre propaganda to from Cyrus told</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people that if the Persians were </v>

2842
02:46:14.980 --> 02:46:17.420
<v Speaker 2>to take over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get to go home.</v>

2843
02:46:18.500 --> 02:46:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Start with the deportees from Judah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish people today.</v>

2844
02:46:24.381 --> 02:46:25.340
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are still,</v>

2845
02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:27.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2846
02:46:27.061 --> 02:46:32.061
<v Speaker 2>even with all the troubles Jews in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the world today that are </v>

2847
02:46:32.061 --> 02:46:36.071
<v Speaker 2>descendants of people who were forcibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>removed after the Babylonians sacked </v>

2848
02:46:36.071 --> 02:46:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Jerusalem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if Cyrus was telling those people,</v>

2849
02:46:39.260 --> 02:46:41.090
<v Speaker 2>if I get a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could empower you,</v>

2850
02:46:41.091 --> 02:46:43.340
<v Speaker 2>can go home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what if he was telling all the other</v>

2851
02:46:43.341 --> 02:46:47.960
<v Speaker 2>deportees the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now in historians refer to Cyrus and the</v>

2852
02:46:47.961 --> 02:46:52.961
<v Speaker 2>Persians propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first idea that comes to mind is </v>

2853
02:46:52.961 --> 02:46:56.441
<v Speaker 2>like negative propaganda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Nazi stuff designed to lie to </v>

2854
02:46:56.441 --> 02:46:56.960
<v Speaker 2>people and get you to believe things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that aren't true,</v>

2855
02:46:57.740 --> 02:47:02.740
<v Speaker 2>but you could make a case that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>since we know that Cyrus and the </v>

2856
02:47:02.740 --> 02:47:05.720
<v Speaker 2>Persians will eventually actually do </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're saying here,</v>

2857
02:47:05.750 --> 02:47:06.050
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2858
02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:07.700
<v Speaker 2>That they will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

2859
02:47:07.701 --> 02:47:12.701
<v Speaker 2>allow the Jews to go back to Judah and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reestablish their religion and even </v>

2860
02:47:12.701 --> 02:47:16.040
<v Speaker 2>eventually pay for some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebuilding of the second temple.</v>

2861
02:47:16.280 --> 02:47:19.130
<v Speaker 2>What will be the second temple with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with royal funds,</v>

2862
02:47:19.460 --> 02:47:21.080
<v Speaker 2>when you know that they're actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do that?</v>

2863
02:47:21.290 --> 02:47:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you could say that this propaganda</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a lot more like dropping leaflets </v>

2864
02:47:26.290 --> 02:47:28.790
<v Speaker 2>over enemy military lines that say </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like,</v>

2865
02:47:28.791 --> 02:47:29.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surrendered to us.</v>

2866
02:47:29.871 --> 02:47:33.090
<v Speaker 2>We don't hurt prisoners and we'll give </v>
<v Speaker 2>you a hot meal and you know,</v>

2867
02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:34.670
<v Speaker 2>a few bucks in your pocket and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes.</v>

2868
02:47:34.671 --> 02:47:35.810
<v Speaker 2>What would they have done in the old </v>
<v Speaker 2>days?</v>

2869
02:47:37.370 --> 02:47:41.390
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this is like telling the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside Babylon do not fear.</v>

2870
02:47:41.690 --> 02:47:46.070
<v Speaker 2>I may be coming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to send you home now.</v>

2871
02:47:46.820 --> 02:47:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Real experts on this Ip embryonic </v>
<v Speaker 2>caution us against thinking about this </v>

2872
02:47:51.820 --> 02:47:55.991
<v Speaker 2>the way that I just described to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is a a conscious policy of </v>

2873
02:47:56.601 --> 02:47:57.230
<v Speaker 2>toleration.</v>

2874
02:47:57.230 --> 02:48:00.260
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way the marketing really is is a lot</v>

2875
02:48:00.261 --> 02:48:05.261
<v Speaker 2>more like cyrus's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Assyrian and Babylonian predecessors </v>

2876
02:48:05.261 --> 02:48:09.220
<v Speaker 2>where he's essentially promising </v>
<v Speaker 2>continuity and because continuity means </v>

2877
02:48:10.251 --> 02:48:13.910
<v Speaker 2>allowing these people to do things the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that they're accustomed to do it,</v>

2878
02:48:14.420 --> 02:48:19.420
<v Speaker 2>it seems like tolerance and he points </v>
<v Speaker 2>out that it's normal for conquerors in </v>

2879
02:48:19.420 --> 02:48:24.281
<v Speaker 2>this region even before this time period</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come in and promise to restore </v>

2880
02:48:24.281 --> 02:48:25.760
<v Speaker 2>everything that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The gods are upset.</v>

2881
02:48:25.761 --> 02:48:28.040
<v Speaker 2>I will fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The economy is bad.</v>

2882
02:48:28.041 --> 02:48:33.041
<v Speaker 2>I will fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are kept away from your home and </v>

2883
02:48:33.041 --> 02:48:33.041
<v Speaker 2>your gods are just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2884
02:48:33.041 --> 02:48:36.080
<v Speaker 2>I will fix that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the restore and recreate her of order.</v>

2885
02:48:37.540 --> 02:48:41.690
<v Speaker 2>So whatever you want to call this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 5:39,</v>

2886
02:48:42.260 --> 02:48:47.260
<v Speaker 2>cyrus and the Babylonian army meet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a battle where there seems to have </v>

2887
02:48:47.841 --> 02:48:50.150
<v Speaker 2>been a really nasty massacre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the end,</v>

2888
02:48:50.660 --> 02:48:55.660
<v Speaker 2>the Babylonian army was defeated the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the troops that are run back to </v>

2889
02:48:55.660 --> 02:49:00.611
<v Speaker 2>the very formidable defenses of the city</v>
<v Speaker 2>and within two days,</v>

2890
02:49:01.850 --> 02:49:06.850
<v Speaker 2>somehow the gates of the city are opened</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Cyrus's general is marching through </v>

2891
02:49:06.850 --> 02:49:08.070
<v Speaker 2>the streets and triumph in Babylon</v>

2892
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:13.070
<v Speaker 5>falls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now tonight is fleas and he's </v>

2893
02:49:13.070 --> 02:49:13.890
<v Speaker 5>eventually captured and supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 5>treated well by Cyrus.</v>

2894
02:49:13.891 --> 02:49:17.220
<v Speaker 5>Just like all the other kings were </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hurghada.</v>

2895
02:49:17.221 --> 02:49:22.221
<v Speaker 5>This of course has to give us a </v>
<v Speaker 5>stratagem story of how it happened this </v>

2896
02:49:22.221 --> 02:49:22.221
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It involves,</v>

2897
02:49:22.221 --> 02:49:26.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>waiting till they can get the river </v>

2898
02:49:26.540 --> 02:49:28.461
<v Speaker 5>down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the flows through the city to a certain </v>

2899
02:49:28.461 --> 02:49:30.501
<v Speaker 5>length or to a point where the troops </v>
<v Speaker 5>can go through the marshes or what have </v>

2900
02:49:30.501 --> 02:49:34.221
<v Speaker 5>you and capture the city.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think he's one of the ones that </v>

2901
02:49:34.221 --> 02:49:37.521
<v Speaker 5>say that the city didn't even know it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was being captured because there was </v>

2902
02:49:37.521 --> 02:49:37.521
<v Speaker 5>some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2903
02:49:37.521 --> 02:49:41.920
<v Speaker 5>revelry going on attached to a religious</v>
<v Speaker 5>cult and the city so big anyway mean </v>

2904
02:49:42.931 --> 02:49:47.931
<v Speaker 5>modern excavations put the city size is </v>
<v Speaker 5>over 2000 acres and the wall </v>

2905
02:49:48.961 --> 02:49:53.160
<v Speaker 5>circumference at about 11 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's possible that in one part of the</v>

2906
02:49:53.161 --> 02:49:56.310
<v Speaker 5>city where they were partying it up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Persians got in,</v>

2907
02:49:57.360 --> 02:50:00.330
<v Speaker 5>the natural thing to do would be to </v>
<v Speaker 5>throw out a story like that and blame it</v>

2908
02:50:00.331 --> 02:50:01.630
<v Speaker 5>on typical,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2909
02:50:01.750 --> 02:50:03.380
<v Speaker 5>Greek stereotypes and whatnot.</v>

2910
02:50:03.420 --> 02:50:08.420
<v Speaker 5>But it should be pointed out one that </v>
<v Speaker 5>oftentimes in these ancient religions </v>

2911
02:50:08.420 --> 02:50:12.630
<v Speaker 5>there was an awful lot of decadent or </v>
<v Speaker 5>fun or depends on your point of view,</v>

2912
02:50:12.631 --> 02:50:15.750
<v Speaker 5>I guess stuff that was part of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>religious rights.</v>

2913
02:50:15.751 --> 02:50:20.751
<v Speaker 5>And you'll see this in Greece and Rome </v>
<v Speaker 5>and a ton of other religions the world </v>

2914
02:50:20.751 --> 02:50:20.751
<v Speaker 5>over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially in the ancient period.</v>

2915
02:50:20.751 --> 02:50:22.830
<v Speaker 5>And these people are immensely </v>
<v Speaker 5>religious.</v>

2916
02:50:22.831 --> 02:50:25.620
<v Speaker 5>The Babylonians especially,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a holy city of Mesopotamia,</v>

2917
02:50:25.621 --> 02:50:26.850
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are very religious people.</v>

2918
02:50:26.851 --> 02:50:30.990
<v Speaker 5>So imagine people with the commitment of</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a Taliban,</v>

2919
02:50:31.260 --> 02:50:36.260
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The seriousness with which they take </v>

2920
02:50:36.260 --> 02:50:36.260
<v Speaker 5>this in stride and militancy and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

2921
02:50:36.260 --> 02:50:40.790
<v Speaker 5>but you might be commanded to party.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a party for God and if you're not </v>

2922
02:50:40.790 --> 02:50:42.720
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ramifications could be huge.</v>

2923
02:50:42.930 --> 02:50:47.930
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm inclined to think that it's a Greek </v>

2924
02:50:47.930 --> 02:50:51.501
<v Speaker 5>stereotype of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a part of me that wants to </v>

2925
02:50:51.501 --> 02:50:51.501
<v Speaker 5>believe it's the latter.</v>

2926
02:50:51.660 --> 02:50:52.380
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the one thing,</v>

2927
02:50:52.381 --> 02:50:55.470
<v Speaker 5>this conquest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if that's even the right word of Babylon</v>

2928
02:50:55.471 --> 02:51:00.471
<v Speaker 5>is known for is the fact that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>generally considered to be bloodless and</v>

2929
02:51:01.890 --> 02:51:06.890
<v Speaker 5>forget that battle we talked about with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the nasty potential massacre at the end </v>

2930
02:51:06.890 --> 02:51:10.650
<v Speaker 5>when the city of Babylon is taken,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's taken essentially voluntarily.</v>

2931
02:51:10.651 --> 02:51:12.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like the Babylonians open up</v>
<v Speaker 5>the door and Cyrus says,</v>

2932
02:51:12.781 --> 02:51:15.480
<v Speaker 5>general comes in and 17 or so days </v>
<v Speaker 5>later,</v>

2933
02:51:15.481 --> 02:51:17.910
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus himself comes in and we're told </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the population,</v>

2934
02:51:18.190 --> 02:51:23.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gets in front of his chariot and lays </v>

2935
02:51:23.190 --> 02:51:25.011
<v Speaker 5>down palm fronds and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which some historians in the old days </v>

2936
02:51:25.011 --> 02:51:27.350
<v Speaker 5>used to be sure was a sign of how much </v>
<v Speaker 5>people wanted them.</v>

2937
02:51:27.360 --> 02:51:32.360
<v Speaker 5>They're more modern day historian's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Point out that that's generally how you </v>

2938
02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:35.901
<v Speaker 5>get treated when you come into a city </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's trying to show that they're no </v>

2939
02:51:35.901 --> 02:51:36.090
<v Speaker 5>threat at all and please don't hurt us.</v>

2940
02:51:37.350 --> 02:51:42.090
<v Speaker 5>That's perhaps what the Persian takeover</v>
<v Speaker 5>of Babylon is most known for.</v>

2941
02:51:42.450 --> 02:51:46.620
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus didn't hurt anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and as I said earlier,</v>

2942
02:51:46.680 --> 02:51:51.680
<v Speaker 5>Naba is his life is spared,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which supposedly is the same fate that </v>

2943
02:51:52.621 --> 02:51:55.170
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus has made it out to all the kings </v>
<v Speaker 5>he's faced,</v>

2944
02:51:55.171 --> 02:51:59.370
<v Speaker 5>which by the way is not only unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not even maybe true.</v>

2945
02:51:59.371 --> 02:52:04.371
<v Speaker 5>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are always little hints somewhere </v>

2946
02:52:04.371 --> 02:52:04.371
<v Speaker 5>that maybe Cyrus killed these kings and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the propaganda covered it up.</v>

2947
02:52:04.371 --> 02:52:06.250
<v Speaker 5>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>historically and traditionally,</v>

2948
02:52:06.460 --> 02:52:10.330
<v Speaker 5>he supposed to have spared and given </v>
<v Speaker 5>good lives to all these other kings.</v>

2949
02:52:10.331 --> 02:52:13.420
<v Speaker 5>He defeated osteotomies of the medes </v>
<v Speaker 5>creases of the Lydians.</v>

2950
02:52:13.570 --> 02:52:15.730
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now benign cysts of the Babylonians.</v>

2951
02:52:16.880 --> 02:52:19.910
<v Speaker 5>What is the message Cyrus is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>send here?</v>

2952
02:52:19.911 --> 02:52:21.380
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what I find interesting.</v>

2953
02:52:21.620 --> 02:52:24.890
<v Speaker 5>You want to know a little bit about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy himself and maybe what he was trying</v>

2954
02:52:24.891 --> 02:52:26.780
<v Speaker 5>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the message when he does that?</v>

2955
02:52:26.781 --> 02:52:31.781
<v Speaker 5>Because the Assyrian King,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who last conquered Babylon brags about </v>

2956
02:52:31.781 --> 02:52:36.101
<v Speaker 5>how he tied the king of Babylon up like </v>
<v Speaker 5>a pig and display them in the center of </v>

2957
02:52:36.111 --> 02:52:41.111
<v Speaker 5>Nineveh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this is not standard operating </v>

2958
02:52:41.111 --> 02:52:41.111
<v Speaker 5>procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the things,</v>

2959
02:52:41.111 --> 02:52:42.170
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that fascinates me about Cyrus,</v>

2960
02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:45.200
<v Speaker 5>because the outcomes razor approach to </v>
<v Speaker 5>history,</v>

2961
02:52:45.201 --> 02:52:46.790
<v Speaker 5>which is the right way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2962
02:52:46.791 --> 02:52:50.120
<v Speaker 5>what else are you going to do is to </v>
<v Speaker 5>assume the most logical things,</v>

2963
02:52:50.121 --> 02:52:51.950
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't assume illogical things.</v>

2964
02:52:52.250 --> 02:52:57.250
<v Speaker 5>So the assumption always is that someone</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Cyrus is playing a hardcore cynical</v>

2965
02:52:57.651 --> 02:52:59.480
<v Speaker 5>propaganda game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>

2966
02:52:59.481 --> 02:53:01.640
<v Speaker 5>odds are probably is most people would </v>
<v Speaker 5>be,</v>

2967
02:53:02.240 --> 02:53:07.240
<v Speaker 5>but occasionally you're going to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>some different kind of human being </v>

2968
02:53:07.240 --> 02:53:07.310
<v Speaker 5>because we see them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they exist.</v>

2969
02:53:08.610 --> 02:53:12.180
<v Speaker 5>It's just if you're using the alchemist </v>
<v Speaker 5>razor approach to try to determine,</v>

2970
02:53:12.420 --> 02:53:17.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what a gone Gandhi was really like a </v>

2971
02:53:17.420 --> 02:53:17.420
<v Speaker 5>thousand years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you might be looking at listened.</v>

2972
02:53:17.420 --> 02:53:17.850
<v Speaker 5>Gandhi was really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2973
02:53:18.150 --> 02:53:20.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this was a cynical attempt to figure out</v>

2974
02:53:20.161 --> 02:53:21.480
<v Speaker 5>a way to gain power to level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2975
02:53:21.481 --> 02:53:24.480
<v Speaker 5>you could figure out all these real </v>
<v Speaker 5>logical reasons why a guy might do this.</v>

2976
02:53:26.330 --> 02:53:31.330
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes people who are doing things </v>
<v Speaker 5>for mystic reasons or morality reasons </v>

2977
02:53:31.401 --> 02:53:33.380
<v Speaker 5>or humanistic reasons or any of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

2978
02:53:33.381 --> 02:53:38.381
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes those people slipped through </v>
<v Speaker 5>the cracks because it's just so easy to </v>

2979
02:53:38.381 --> 02:53:40.820
<v Speaker 5>assume they had a more real world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>terra firma reason for doing things.</v>

2980
02:53:41.150 --> 02:53:45.940
<v Speaker 5>Is it possible that cyrus was kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>humanist?</v>

2981
02:53:46.190 --> 02:53:49.370
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is how he's portrayed by the way,</v>

2982
02:53:49.371 --> 02:53:51.950
<v Speaker 5>by his real fans and a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>back in Iran.</v>

2983
02:53:52.230 --> 02:53:57.230
<v Speaker 5>I mean as the guy who invented human </v>
<v Speaker 5>rights sort of at least as a ruler is </v>

2984
02:53:58.251 --> 02:54:03.251
<v Speaker 5>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Babylon is one of the number one </v>

2985
02:54:03.251 --> 02:54:03.251
<v Speaker 5>pieces of evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2986
02:54:03.251 --> 02:54:06.971
<v Speaker 5>that gets trotted out in defense of this</v>
<v Speaker 5>idea that this isn't just some sort of </v>

2987
02:54:06.971 --> 02:54:11.381
<v Speaker 5>policy of tolerance for expediency sake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That this is how Cyrus really believes </v>

2988
02:54:13.640 --> 02:54:14.750
<v Speaker 5>you can govern.</v>

2989
02:54:16.210 --> 02:54:21.210
<v Speaker 5>And it should be pointed out that that </v>
<v Speaker 5>not only has babylon kind of surrender </v>

2990
02:54:21.210 --> 02:54:24.991
<v Speaker 5>without a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's another Babylonian city or two </v>

2991
02:54:24.991 --> 02:54:26.770
<v Speaker 5>that kind of opens their doors to Cyrus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's interesting because,</v>

2992
02:54:26.790 --> 02:54:31.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>resists Origami has an interesting take </v>

2993
02:54:31.790 --> 02:54:31.890
<v Speaker 5>on something that the Babylonian King </v>
<v Speaker 5>did as part of the,</v>

2994
02:54:31.920 --> 02:54:36.920
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fighting with Cyrus for Babylon </v>

2995
02:54:36.920 --> 02:54:39.990
<v Speaker 5>supposedly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is a way to look at nab </v>

2996
02:54:39.990 --> 02:54:39.990
<v Speaker 5>tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is showing that maybe he was this really</v>

2997
02:54:39.990 --> 02:54:43.450
<v Speaker 5>responsible king after all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>before Cyrus gets to Babylon nab night,</v>

2998
02:54:43.460 --> 02:54:45.390
<v Speaker 5>it goes around to all the surrounding </v>
<v Speaker 5>towns and,</v>

2999
02:54:45.391 --> 02:54:48.280
<v Speaker 5>and takes their gods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>takes all their little,</v>

3000
02:54:48.450 --> 02:54:52.510
<v Speaker 5>the statues and the representations of </v>
<v Speaker 5>their gods and takes them to Babylon.</v>

3001
02:54:53.590 --> 02:54:56.360
<v Speaker 5>And traditionally this is considered to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be an act of safekeeping,</v>

3002
02:54:56.470 --> 02:54:58.420
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know that you don't want your statue</v>

3003
02:54:58.421 --> 02:55:03.421
<v Speaker 5>of Liberty falling into the hands of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>elamites and ending up in their trophy </v>

3004
02:55:03.421 --> 02:55:03.421
<v Speaker 5>case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3005
02:55:03.421 --> 02:55:07.560
<v Speaker 5>So you take all these village,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God's back to Babylon for safekeeping </v>

3006
02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:12.340
<v Speaker 5>reasons are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Me Though has an interesting take on </v>

3007
02:55:12.340 --> 02:55:12.470
<v Speaker 5>this in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>discovering Cyrus,</v>

3008
02:55:12.740 --> 02:55:15.470
<v Speaker 5>he does a great job reminding us of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting,</v>

3009
02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:20.520
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>belief systems of the people who have </v>

3010
02:55:20.520 --> 02:55:22.481
<v Speaker 5>these gods.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then how maybe you could see what </v>

3011
02:55:22.481 --> 02:55:25.511
<v Speaker 5>nab and knight is doing is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>equivalent of perhaps kidnapping the </v>

3012
02:55:25.511 --> 02:55:30.071
<v Speaker 5>gods of these towns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And holding them hostage for good </v>

3013
02:55:30.071 --> 02:55:30.071
<v Speaker 5>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3014
02:55:30.560 --> 02:55:33.860
<v Speaker 5>Stay loyal to Babylon or your God gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>it in the neck.</v>

3015
02:55:33.950 --> 02:55:35.840
<v Speaker 5>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's what's our gummy rights,</v>

3016
02:55:36.110 --> 02:55:41.110
<v Speaker 5>and remember,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this only makes sense if nab tonight is </v>

3017
02:55:41.110 --> 02:55:42.890
<v Speaker 5>a seriously worried that some of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>towns are just going to go over to cyrus</v>

3018
02:55:42.891 --> 02:55:45.740
<v Speaker 5>because of the propaganda or whatever he</v>
<v Speaker 5>writes,</v>

3019
02:55:45.741 --> 02:55:50.741
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>faced with the very real prospect that </v>

3020
02:55:50.741 --> 02:55:53.861
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cities would open up their gates to the </v>

3021
02:55:53.861 --> 02:55:53.861
<v Speaker 5>conqueror.</v>

3022
02:55:53.861 --> 02:55:54.470
<v Speaker 5>Nab Tonight is settled upon a drastic </v>
<v Speaker 5>policy.</v>

3023
02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:59.710
<v Speaker 5>He decided to hold hostage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The sacred idols of Babylonia is </v>

3024
02:55:59.710 --> 02:56:01.790
<v Speaker 5>outlying cities to ensure the loyalty of</v>
<v Speaker 5>their inhabitants.</v>

3025
02:56:02.060 --> 02:56:06.080
<v Speaker 5>So when Cyrus in his army resumed their </v>
<v Speaker 5>march in the late summer of 5:39</v>

3026
02:56:06.081 --> 02:56:11.081
<v Speaker 5>bce,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a series of caravans laden with divine </v>

3027
02:56:11.081 --> 02:56:13.850
<v Speaker 5>images and other religious artifacts </v>
<v Speaker 5>made its way to Babylon.</v>

3028
02:56:14.180 --> 02:56:19.180
<v Speaker 5>Living today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can hardly grasp the full </v>

3029
02:56:19.180 --> 02:56:19.850
<v Speaker 5>psychological impact of nab.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unitus is action.</v>

3030
02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:25.120
<v Speaker 5>The idol was the centerpiece of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ancient Mesopotamian cult and the most </v>

3031
02:56:25.120 --> 02:56:29.051
<v Speaker 5>important symbol of the community.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The inanimate statues were treated like </v>

3032
02:56:29.051 --> 02:56:29.840
<v Speaker 5>royalty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bathed,</v>

3033
02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:31.580
<v Speaker 5>perfumed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>groomed,</v>

3034
02:56:31.670 --> 02:56:35.540
<v Speaker 5>and even fed lavish meals by an </v>
<v Speaker 5>entourage of domestic servants.</v>

3035
02:56:35.570 --> 02:56:40.570
<v Speaker 5>Priests and personal attendance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ancient Mesopotamian cults were </v>

3036
02:56:40.570 --> 02:56:44.180
<v Speaker 5>geographically centralized and the God's</v>
<v Speaker 5>power's territorially limited.</v>

3037
02:56:44.450 --> 02:56:48.620
<v Speaker 5>That is why Cyrus could not receive the </v>
<v Speaker 5>divine approval he desired with the gods</v>

3038
02:56:48.621 --> 02:56:52.160
<v Speaker 5>concentrated in Babylon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He then continues,</v>

3039
02:56:52.161 --> 02:56:57.161
<v Speaker 5>but nab unitus was playing a dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 5>game by emptying is cities have their </v>

3040
02:56:57.161 --> 02:56:57.161
<v Speaker 5>idols.</v>

3041
02:56:57.161 --> 02:57:01.810
<v Speaker 5>Proximity to the cult statue meant </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything to the superstitious masses </v>

3042
02:57:01.810 --> 02:57:04.220
<v Speaker 5>who believed that the sacred images of </v>
<v Speaker 5>their gods could perform miracles,</v>

3043
02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:06.590
<v Speaker 5>cure illness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and most importantly,</v>

3044
02:57:06.740 --> 02:57:11.740
<v Speaker 5>protect their settlements.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cities last divine protection when </v>

3045
02:57:11.740 --> 02:57:15.281
<v Speaker 5>they're God's left and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the first things that Cyrus will </v>

3046
02:57:16.281 --> 02:57:21.281
<v Speaker 5>brag about doing when he takes over </v>
<v Speaker 5>Babylon is returning all those gods to </v>

3047
02:57:23.511 --> 02:57:27.860
<v Speaker 5>the outlying communities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and those people freaking out at,</v>

3048
02:57:28.030 --> 02:57:29.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having their gods back.</v>

3049
02:57:29.810 --> 02:57:30.950
<v Speaker 5>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as Pierre,</v>

3050
02:57:30.951 --> 02:57:35.951
<v Speaker 5>Brianna says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus's portraying himself as the </v>

3051
02:57:35.951 --> 02:57:36.770
<v Speaker 5>restorer of order of things as they </v>
<v Speaker 5>should be.</v>

3052
02:57:37.610 --> 02:57:42.610
<v Speaker 5>He's beginning to tie himself to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ancient Assyrian tradition.</v>

3053
02:57:43.880 --> 02:57:48.880
<v Speaker 5>Some historians suggest consciously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'll talk about repairing something in </v>

3054
02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:50.750
<v Speaker 5>the city and coming across some </v>
<v Speaker 5>proclamation by Asha,</v>

3055
02:57:50.751 --> 02:57:52.430
<v Speaker 5>Bonnie Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Assyrian King.</v>

3056
02:57:52.431 --> 02:57:57.431
<v Speaker 5>He'll tie himself to Assyria and this </v>
<v Speaker 5>ancient in a royal tradition.</v>

3057
02:57:57.890 --> 02:58:01.100
<v Speaker 5>When he starts calling himself king of </v>
<v Speaker 5>kings and King of the universe,</v>

3058
02:58:01.440 --> 02:58:02.480
<v Speaker 5>these are old,</v>

3059
02:58:02.480 --> 02:58:07.480
<v Speaker 2>a Syrian and even acadian terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if cyrus was starting to use these </v>

3060
02:58:08.531 --> 02:58:13.531
<v Speaker 2>ancient titles for himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see why he thought he might </v>

3061
02:58:13.531 --> 02:58:17.251
<v Speaker 2>deserve it because 80 or 90 years after </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the ancient kingdom of Assyria </v>

3062
02:58:18.910 --> 02:58:23.910
<v Speaker 2>fell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cyrus had put Humpty dumpty back </v>

3063
02:58:23.910 --> 02:58:27.361
<v Speaker 2>together again with sort of a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>form and different marketing and </v>

3064
02:58:29.381 --> 02:58:33.670
<v Speaker 2>different branding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all of a sudden,</v>

3065
02:58:33.671 --> 02:58:38.671
<v Speaker 2>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as head existed during later a </v>

3066
02:58:38.671 --> 02:58:41.990
<v Speaker 2>Syrian times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one power had had Gemini in that part of</v>

3067
02:58:42.191 --> 02:58:47.191
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now trying to rule immensely different </v>

3068
02:58:50.021 --> 02:58:55.021
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People from you know everything from </v>

3069
02:58:55.021 --> 02:58:55.540
<v Speaker 2>from deeply urban environments and </v>
<v Speaker 2>places like Babylon,</v>

3070
02:58:56.290 --> 02:59:01.290
<v Speaker 2>to Phoenecian cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two tribes that existed off in the edges</v>

3071
02:59:01.391 --> 02:59:06.391
<v Speaker 2>of the Eurasian Steppe and incorporate </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different people into one </v>

3072
02:59:06.391 --> 02:59:06.880
<v Speaker 2>empire.</v>

3073
02:59:08.140 --> 02:59:13.140
<v Speaker 2>Much is made of the different strategies</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the Persians used over the </v>

3074
02:59:13.140 --> 02:59:14.890
<v Speaker 2>Assyrians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of trying to shoo everybody into</v>

3075
02:59:14.891 --> 02:59:16.020
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3076
02:59:16.190 --> 02:59:19.450
<v Speaker 2>cultural style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>convert everybody to your religion.</v>

3077
02:59:20.650 --> 02:59:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Make Good Assyrians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have these conquered people.</v>

3078
02:59:23.890 --> 02:59:28.890
<v Speaker 2>The Persians used a much lighter touch </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the idea of toleration really was </v>

3079
02:59:28.890 --> 02:59:32.971
<v Speaker 2>to allow local customs to continue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Assyrians wouldn't have tolerated </v>

3080
02:59:33.491 --> 02:59:36.070
<v Speaker 2>that the fact that the Persians didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to change all that,</v>

3081
02:59:36.071 --> 02:59:39.370
<v Speaker 2>whether it was a question of religion or</v>
<v Speaker 2>language or anything else.</v>

3082
02:59:39.371 --> 02:59:44.371
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the Persian empire gets up and </v>

3083
02:59:44.371 --> 02:59:46.531
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Persians will be put in all the most </v>

3084
02:59:46.531 --> 02:59:48.901
<v Speaker 2>important positions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Persian will not be the language of </v>

3085
02:59:48.901 --> 02:59:53.511
<v Speaker 2>the empire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There will always be only a tiny </v>

3086
02:59:53.511 --> 02:59:53.511
<v Speaker 2>minority of people actually speaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>Persian.</v>

3087
02:59:53.511 --> 02:59:56.280
<v Speaker 2>All of the official proclamations will </v>
<v Speaker 2>be multilingual,</v>

3088
02:59:56.281 --> 02:59:57.810
<v Speaker 2>so the different people can read them.</v>

3089
02:59:59.190 --> 03:00:02.010
<v Speaker 2>All the local gods are respected and </v>
<v Speaker 2>supported.</v>

3090
03:00:02.760 --> 03:00:03.330
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3091
03:00:03.331 --> 03:00:05.310
<v Speaker 2>is this some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3092
03:00:05.311 --> 03:00:10.311
<v Speaker 2>humanitarian gesture on Cyrus's part or </v>
<v Speaker 2>is it a guy who is a humanitarian and </v>

3093
03:00:10.311 --> 03:00:10.830
<v Speaker 2>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

3094
03:00:10.831 --> 03:00:13.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm just telling you this is the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to treat people and it will work out</v>

3095
03:00:13.800 --> 03:00:14.520
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

3096
03:00:14.521 --> 03:00:19.521
<v Speaker 2>a guy who believes his own humanitarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>beliefs and morals dove tail into good </v>

3097
03:00:19.521 --> 03:00:23.691
<v Speaker 2>outcomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or is it somebody who cynically looked </v>

3098
03:00:23.691 --> 03:00:23.691
<v Speaker 2>at this and just says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

3099
03:00:23.691 --> 03:00:24.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm just telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we do it this way,</v>

3100
03:00:24.121 --> 03:00:29.121
<v Speaker 2>we'll have less revolts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be much better than the way the </v>

3101
03:00:29.121 --> 03:00:29.121
<v Speaker 2>Assyrians did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

3102
03:00:29.790 --> 03:00:33.390
<v Speaker 2>It's tempting to think of Cyrus as </v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant and visionary,</v>

3103
03:00:33.720 --> 03:00:36.360
<v Speaker 2>regardless of which one of those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>is true.</v>

3104
03:00:37.860 --> 03:00:42.860
<v Speaker 2>He organizes this empire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He starts creating things that are </v>

3105
03:00:42.860 --> 03:00:45.831
<v Speaker 2>called satraps in sat trapeze,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are administrative units that will</v>

3106
03:00:45.961 --> 03:00:50.961
<v Speaker 2>be built upon by his successors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the next major thing we hear </v>

3107
03:00:51.091 --> 03:00:56.091
<v Speaker 2>about Cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like you know when these </v>

3108
03:00:56.091 --> 03:00:57.861
<v Speaker 2>people live that far back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get the highlights of their lives </v>

3109
03:00:57.861 --> 03:00:57.861
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Highlight number one,</v>

3110
03:00:57.861 --> 03:01:00.310
<v Speaker 2>you know conquest of Medea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Highlight number to conquest</v>

3111
03:01:00.310 --> 03:01:05.310
<v Speaker 5>of Lydia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How that number three conquest of </v>

3112
03:01:05.310 --> 03:01:06.961
<v Speaker 5>Babylon highlight number for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>expedition against a queen of one of the</v>

3113
03:01:10.301 --> 03:01:14.530
<v Speaker 5>most powerful tribal coalitions in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Central Asia.</v>

3114
03:01:16.510 --> 03:01:21.510
<v Speaker 5>Now the fact that there is a clean </v>
<v Speaker 5>involved in this story should tip you </v>

3115
03:01:21.510 --> 03:01:23.140
<v Speaker 5>off to the idea that it's going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 5>good one,</v>

3116
03:01:23.800 --> 03:01:27.550
<v Speaker 5>and Hurghada test by the way knows this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's eager to get to this story and he's</v>

3117
03:01:27.551 --> 03:01:29.890
<v Speaker 5>going to spend a ton of time on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's been setting it up.</v>

3118
03:01:30.550 --> 03:01:35.550
<v Speaker 5>He knows his audience is ready.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got a little moral twists that may </v>

3119
03:01:35.550 --> 03:01:35.710
<v Speaker 5>or may not have anything to do with </v>
<v Speaker 5>reality,</v>

3120
03:01:36.130 --> 03:01:41.130
<v Speaker 5>but you get a look at that 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 5>year old mind that your mind melding </v>

3121
03:01:41.130 --> 03:01:44.310
<v Speaker 5>with one way at this point in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it becomes the time where Heraclitus</v>

3122
03:01:44.460 --> 03:01:47.950
<v Speaker 5>is at his least reliable too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3123
03:01:48.070 --> 03:01:52.090
<v Speaker 5>he jumps from highlight number three to </v>
<v Speaker 5>highlight number four in Cyrus's life in</v>

3124
03:01:52.091 --> 03:01:54.790
<v Speaker 5>one second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you look at the actual dates involved</v>

3125
03:01:54.791 --> 03:01:57.550
<v Speaker 5>though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll see that there is like nine years</v>

3126
03:01:57.551 --> 03:02:02.551
<v Speaker 5>between highlight number three and </v>
<v Speaker 5>highlight number four and nine years </v>

3127
03:02:02.551 --> 03:02:05.521
<v Speaker 5>when Cyrus is well to use his own </v>
<v Speaker 5>marketing and branding king of the </v>

3128
03:02:05.521 --> 03:02:09.991
<v Speaker 5>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What the heck was this guy doing for </v>

3129
03:02:09.991 --> 03:02:12.331
<v Speaker 5>nine years while he was putting out some</v>
<v Speaker 5>propaganda?</v>

3130
03:02:12.351 --> 03:02:16.850
<v Speaker 5>We know something called the Cyrus </v>
<v Speaker 5>cylinder is a famous,</v>

3131
03:02:17.180 --> 03:02:22.180
<v Speaker 5>and it's this piece where first cyrus </v>
<v Speaker 5>has the Babylonian gods saying I was </v>

3132
03:02:22.180 --> 03:02:26.111
<v Speaker 5>with him the whole way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then he introduces himself as this </v>

3133
03:02:26.111 --> 03:02:26.111
<v Speaker 5>good guy</v>

3134
03:02:26.111 --> 03:02:28.230
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>propaganda and makes it easier to rule a</v>

3135
03:02:28.231 --> 03:02:29.100
<v Speaker 5>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People,</v>

3136
03:02:29.250 --> 03:02:32.490
<v Speaker 5>if you make it feel like it was your God</v>
<v Speaker 5>that wanted me here</v>

3137
03:02:34.660 --> 03:02:36.460
<v Speaker 5>I came because he took my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

3138
03:02:36.461 --> 03:02:41.461
<v Speaker 5>so so you're legitimizing your rule and </v>
<v Speaker 5>tying you into the to the age old power </v>

3139
03:02:41.461 --> 03:02:45.751
<v Speaker 5>structure and basically saying that king</v>
<v Speaker 5>you defeated was the real weirdo that </v>

3140
03:02:45.751 --> 03:02:46.750
<v Speaker 5>the god didn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am restoring,</v>

3141
03:02:47.120 --> 03:02:52.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the kingship to the people that mark </v>

3142
03:02:52.120 --> 03:02:54.211
<v Speaker 5>wants to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can see that the same is true in a </v>

3143
03:02:54.211 --> 03:02:56.020
<v Speaker 5>lot of the other religions that Cyrus is</v>
<v Speaker 5>involved with.</v>

3144
03:02:56.021 --> 03:03:01.021
<v Speaker 5>This is why a lot of people think his </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole propaganda tolerance thing was </v>

3145
03:03:01.021 --> 03:03:03.841
<v Speaker 5>much more of a political move because </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at how it helps him politically in </v>

3146
03:03:04.091 --> 03:03:09.091
<v Speaker 5>a way that by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he could not have foreseen it made them </v>

3147
03:03:09.091 --> 03:03:09.091
<v Speaker 5>immortal.</v>

3148
03:03:10.340 --> 03:03:14.210
<v Speaker 5>This is from peer Brown's book from </v>
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus to Alexander,</v>

3149
03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:19.480
<v Speaker 5>but at the translation from the Bible </v>
<v Speaker 5>that he uses in the same way that the </v>

3150
03:03:19.480 --> 03:03:20.360
<v Speaker 5>cyrus cylinder says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Babylonian God,</v>

3151
03:03:20.361 --> 03:03:23.630
<v Speaker 5>Marduk took Cyrus's hand and swept away </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the opposition.</v>

3152
03:03:24.260 --> 03:03:26.750
<v Speaker 5>This is what the Israeli God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yahweh did,</v>

3153
03:03:26.751 --> 03:03:31.751
<v Speaker 5>according to the Bible quote that says </v>
<v Speaker 5>y'all way to his appointed to Cyrus,</v>

3154
03:03:32.420 --> 03:03:37.420
<v Speaker 5>whom he has taken by his right hand to </v>
<v Speaker 5>subdue nations before him and stripped </v>

3155
03:03:37.420 --> 03:03:41.690
<v Speaker 5>the loins of kings to force gateways </v>
<v Speaker 5>before him that their gates be closed no</v>

3156
03:03:41.691 --> 03:03:46.691
<v Speaker 5>more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will go before you leveling the </v>

3157
03:03:46.691 --> 03:03:47.060
<v Speaker 5>heights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will shatter the bronze gateways,</v>

3158
03:03:47.180 --> 03:03:50.870
<v Speaker 5>smash the iron bars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will give you the hidden treasures,</v>

3159
03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:54.030
<v Speaker 5>the secret hordes that you may know that</v>
<v Speaker 5>I am your way.</v>

3160
03:03:55.110 --> 03:03:59.210
<v Speaker 5>And so once again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cyrus has these gods on his side.</v>

3161
03:03:59.360 --> 03:04:00.410
<v Speaker 5>Why are they on this side?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3162
03:04:00.411 --> 03:04:02.240
<v Speaker 5>he's always helping,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't he?</v>

3163
03:04:02.480 --> 03:04:05.600
<v Speaker 5>He's always doing what the priesthood of</v>
<v Speaker 5>Marta would like.</v>

3164
03:04:05.601 --> 03:04:10.601
<v Speaker 5>In general.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting how Martin follows </v>

3165
03:04:10.601 --> 03:04:10.820
<v Speaker 5>along.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He likes if you treat as priests well in</v>

3166
03:04:10.821 --> 03:04:13.220
<v Speaker 5>the case of y'all way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3167
03:04:13.221 --> 03:04:15.100
<v Speaker 5>according to the Bible again and Pierre </v>
<v Speaker 5>Briana,</v>

3168
03:04:15.120 --> 03:04:17.340
<v Speaker 5>skeptical of the details but says in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

3169
03:04:17.341 --> 03:04:18.830
<v Speaker 5>in the bigger picture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least,</v>

3170
03:04:18.831 --> 03:04:20.540
<v Speaker 5>it was consistent with what actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>

3171
03:04:20.930 --> 03:04:24.560
<v Speaker 5>The Bible says that in the reign of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>king to kings,</v>

3172
03:04:24.590 --> 03:04:29.590
<v Speaker 5>after two official kings after Cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they found the actual order that would </v>

3173
03:04:29.590 --> 03:04:31.850
<v Speaker 5>have made y'all way pleased with </v>
<v Speaker 5>investing,</v>

3174
03:04:31.851 --> 03:04:36.610
<v Speaker 5>shall we say in the Cyrus conquests,</v>
<v Speaker 5>according to the Bible and Pierre brands</v>

3175
03:04:36.620 --> 03:04:38.930
<v Speaker 5>description of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is from Ezra,</v>

3176
03:04:38.931 --> 03:04:42.400
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of the royal archives,</v>

3177
03:04:42.410 --> 03:04:43.470
<v Speaker 5>a baton.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

3178
03:04:43.970 --> 03:04:45.080
<v Speaker 5>the order said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

3179
03:04:46.070 --> 03:04:48.260
<v Speaker 5>in the first year of Cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the king,</v>

3180
03:04:48.590 --> 03:04:52.250
<v Speaker 5>King Cyrus decreed temple of God in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jerusalem,</v>

3181
03:04:52.640 --> 03:04:57.640
<v Speaker 5>the temple will be rebuilt as a place at</v>
<v Speaker 5>which sacrifices are offered and by </v>

3182
03:04:57.640 --> 03:04:58.560
<v Speaker 5>which offerings are brought to be burnt.</v>

3183
03:04:58.860 --> 03:05:01.550
<v Speaker 5>It's height as to be 60 cubits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's width,</v>

3184
03:05:01.610 --> 03:05:04.310
<v Speaker 5>60 cubits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're going to be three thicknesses of</v>

3185
03:05:04.311 --> 03:05:09.311
<v Speaker 5>stone blocks and one of would the </v>
<v Speaker 5>expenses to be met by the king's </v>

3186
03:05:09.311 --> 03:05:10.190
<v Speaker 5>household.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Furthermore,</v>

3187
03:05:10.370 --> 03:05:13.460
<v Speaker 5>the vessels of gold and silver from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>temple of God,</v>

3188
03:05:13.640 --> 03:05:18.640
<v Speaker 5>which Nebuchadnezzar took from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sanctuary in Jerusalem and brought to </v>

3189
03:05:18.640 --> 03:05:22.301
<v Speaker 5>Babylon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are to be restored so that everything </v>

3190
03:05:22.301 --> 03:05:25.181
<v Speaker 5>may be restored to the sanctuary in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jerusalem and put back in the temple of </v>

3191
03:05:25.181 --> 03:05:29.111
<v Speaker 5>God and quote that dovetails nicely with</v>
<v Speaker 5>that story of the ghostly hand,</v>

3192
03:05:30.471 --> 03:05:35.471
<v Speaker 5>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because what that Guy Belshazzar was </v>

3193
03:05:35.471 --> 03:05:38.561
<v Speaker 5>drinking out of that made you know you </v>
<v Speaker 5>always so mad to begin with are all </v>

3194
03:05:38.561 --> 03:05:39.950
<v Speaker 5>these sacred vessels from the old temple</v>
<v Speaker 5>in Jerusalem,</v>

3195
03:05:39.951 --> 03:05:43.820
<v Speaker 5>Solomon's Temple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now Cyrus was decreeing that you rebuild</v>

3196
03:05:44.060 --> 03:05:49.060
<v Speaker 5>Solomon's Temple and you pay for it out </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the king's treasury and you bring </v>

3197
03:05:49.371 --> 03:05:54.371
<v Speaker 5>back all these things that are still </v>
<v Speaker 5>around and restock the temple with them,</v>

3198
03:05:54.830 --> 03:05:57.830
<v Speaker 5>and then you send the people who have </v>
<v Speaker 5>been deported here,</v>

3199
03:05:57.831 --> 03:05:58.910
<v Speaker 5>back home.</v>

3200
03:06:00.410 --> 03:06:05.410
<v Speaker 5>Now here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this reconstituted area that will become</v>

3201
03:06:05.931 --> 03:06:08.900
<v Speaker 5>a sad trap by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does not have its political freedom.</v>

3202
03:06:09.050 --> 03:06:10.760
<v Speaker 5>They're not going to be the way they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were.</v>

3203
03:06:11.060 --> 03:06:14.000
<v Speaker 5>You know when the Babylonians and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Egyptians were arguing over them,</v>

3204
03:06:14.630 --> 03:06:17.390
<v Speaker 5>but you got to see that they're pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>darn far ahead.</v>

3205
03:06:17.391 --> 03:06:21.800
<v Speaker 5>They went from a people that might have </v>
<v Speaker 5>died out religiously.</v>

3206
03:06:22.430 --> 03:06:23.360
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the book I had,</v>

3207
03:06:23.361 --> 03:06:28.361
<v Speaker 5>the places Cyrus has one of the top,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most 100 influential people of all time </v>

3208
03:06:28.361 --> 03:06:32.301
<v Speaker 5>says that that's one of the things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you credit him with the fact that </v>

3209
03:06:32.301 --> 03:06:35.351
<v Speaker 5>if he doesn't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a chance Judaism doesn't </v>

3210
03:06:35.351 --> 03:06:37.340
<v Speaker 5>continue over the long haul.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In this case,</v>

3211
03:06:37.341 --> 03:06:39.620
<v Speaker 5>he builds what's known as the second </v>
<v Speaker 5>temple,</v>

3212
03:06:39.860 --> 03:06:44.860
<v Speaker 5>and if you want to see continuity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wall that is still one of the </v>

3213
03:06:44.860 --> 03:06:45.560
<v Speaker 5>holiest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if not the holiest sites,</v>

3214
03:06:45.561 --> 03:06:47.090
<v Speaker 5>I guess the Temple Mount will be holy or</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

3215
03:06:47.091 --> 03:06:51.170
<v Speaker 5>but it's part of the temple.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mount is the famous Western Wall.</v>

3216
03:06:51.320 --> 03:06:55.980
<v Speaker 5>The Western Wall is a Roman era addition</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the</v>

3217
03:06:55.980 --> 03:07:00.980
<v Speaker 2>second temple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which cyrus allegedly according to the </v>

3218
03:07:00.980 --> 03:07:03.120
<v Speaker 2>Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paid for and authorized.</v>

3219
03:07:03.960 --> 03:07:05.220
<v Speaker 2>It's so interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

3220
03:07:05.221 --> 03:07:08.950
<v Speaker 2>To consider how connected the stories of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ancient Iranians,</v>

3221
03:07:08.970 --> 03:07:12.360
<v Speaker 2>the ancient Persians are to the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jewish folks,</v>

3222
03:07:12.600 --> 03:07:15.960
<v Speaker 2>especially considering the current </v>
<v Speaker 2>antagonism between them.</v>

3223
03:07:16.470 --> 03:07:17.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as late as the 19 seventies,</v>

3224
03:07:17.971 --> 03:07:22.971
<v Speaker 2>the shah of Iran was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was touting this ancient closeness </v>

3225
03:07:22.971 --> 03:07:23.460
<v Speaker 2>between the peoples and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

3226
03:07:24.780 --> 03:07:26.940
<v Speaker 2>If not for the ancient Persians and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iranians,</v>

3227
03:07:26.950 --> 03:07:31.950
<v Speaker 2>there's a chance there wouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 2>Judaism today and depending on when it </v>

3228
03:07:31.950 --> 03:07:36.261
<v Speaker 2>died out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a very good chance you wouldn't </v>

3229
03:07:36.261 --> 03:07:37.140
<v Speaker 2>have had the religions that sprouted off</v>
<v Speaker 2>that branch.</v>

3230
03:07:37.141 --> 03:07:39.390
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't have had Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably wouldn't have had Islam.</v>

3231
03:07:39.391 --> 03:07:44.391
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is Cyrus the great actually did do this </v>

3232
03:07:44.391 --> 03:07:47.070
<v Speaker 2>and he had never lived to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would the world look like today?</v>

3233
03:07:47.850 --> 03:07:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Another thing it says in that 100 most </v>
<v Speaker 2>influential people of all time that I </v>

3234
03:07:52.850 --> 03:07:56.061
<v Speaker 2>thought was interesting is that many of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that get credited as being </v>

3235
03:07:56.061 --> 03:07:59.181
<v Speaker 2>very important and dynamic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>instrumental human beings in terms of </v>

3236
03:07:59.401 --> 03:08:04.401
<v Speaker 2>their effect on history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did something that would have been done </v>

3237
03:08:04.401 --> 03:08:05.580
<v Speaker 2>anyway might not have been done at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>time or that way,</v>

3238
03:08:05.850 --> 03:08:07.140
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of this stuff would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

3239
03:08:07.140 --> 03:08:12.140
<v Speaker 2>Someone else would have discovered the </v>
<v Speaker 2>light bulb probably the author thought </v>

3240
03:08:12.140 --> 03:08:13.800
<v Speaker 2>it likely that if cyrus the great had </v>
<v Speaker 2>never lived,</v>

3241
03:08:14.370 --> 03:08:19.370
<v Speaker 2>none of this stuff happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a unique individual and even </v>

3242
03:08:19.370 --> 03:08:24.361
<v Speaker 2>though you can't get your mind around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the specifics of how he was a unique </v>

3243
03:08:24.361 --> 03:08:26.931
<v Speaker 2>individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can sort of look at what built up </v>

3244
03:08:26.931 --> 03:08:26.931
<v Speaker 2>even if he ever wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3245
03:08:26.931 --> 03:08:31.041
<v Speaker 2>and you have to assume that there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of foundation bubbling up up under </v>

3246
03:08:31.041 --> 03:08:34.161
<v Speaker 2>the surface for Cyrus to work with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is still a pretty incredible human </v>

3247
03:08:34.161 --> 03:08:37.881
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you could probably say with a </v>

3248
03:08:37.881 --> 03:08:42.081
<v Speaker 2>decent chance of being right that he is </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the five thirty's bce,</v>

3249
03:08:42.901 --> 03:08:46.440
<v Speaker 2>the greatest geo political figure who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever lived,</v>

3250
03:08:48.330 --> 03:08:52.400
<v Speaker 2>which makes the next thing I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say no.</v>

3251
03:08:52.410 --> 03:08:53.980
<v Speaker 2>So hard to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3252
03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Why should I say it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about letting historian 80 olmsted </v>

3253
03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:00.180
<v Speaker 2>in a book published in Nineteen Forty </v>
<v Speaker 2>Eight?</v>

3254
03:09:00.960 --> 03:09:05.960
<v Speaker 2>Say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any more of a telling example </v>

3255
03:09:06.271 --> 03:09:08.900
<v Speaker 2>that these people live at the very tail </v>
<v Speaker 2>end,</v>

3256
03:09:08.920 --> 03:09:13.920
<v Speaker 2>the black and white era of recording of </v>
<v Speaker 2>human history because how can this guy </v>

3257
03:09:13.920 --> 03:09:16.170
<v Speaker 2>be as big as he is and yet this next </v>
<v Speaker 2>line be true?</v>

3258
03:09:16.260 --> 03:09:19.530
<v Speaker 2>Olmsted said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we must leave Cyrus for suddenly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>without warning.</v>

3260
03:09:23.160 --> 03:09:28.160
<v Speaker 2>Our information comes to an end and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>quote 200 years after this period,</v>

3261
03:09:30.540 --> 03:09:35.540
<v Speaker 2>we will know Alexander the Great's </v>
<v Speaker 2>symptoms to such a degree that doctors </v>

3262
03:09:35.540 --> 03:09:38.850
<v Speaker 2>today try to diagnose what he may have </v>
<v Speaker 2>died of and they still don't know.</v>

3263
03:09:38.851 --> 03:09:43.851
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying everything's perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know where when the how's the </v>

3264
03:09:43.851 --> 03:09:46.830
<v Speaker 2>why's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can you not know how this guy dies?</v>

3265
03:09:48.300 --> 03:09:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Highlight number four in his life as </v>
<v Speaker 2>portrayed by Heraclitus is Hurghada </v>

3266
03:09:53.300 --> 03:09:54.040
<v Speaker 2>tells a story of how</v>

3267
03:09:54.040 --> 03:09:59.040
<v Speaker 5>he dies and I love the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hurghada does goes to the trouble to </v>

3268
03:09:59.040 --> 03:10:00.640
<v Speaker 5>point out that he's heard several </v>
<v Speaker 5>different versions of this story,</v>

3269
03:10:00.641 --> 03:10:05.641
<v Speaker 5>but the one he's going to give you is </v>
<v Speaker 5>the one he thinks is most likely and </v>

3270
03:10:05.641 --> 03:10:10.021
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's just a coincidence that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>story that Hurghada thinks is most </v>

3271
03:10:10.021 --> 03:10:14.641
<v Speaker 5>likely is the one with the most exotic </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting movie like elements to it.</v>

3272
03:10:16.361 --> 03:10:19.390
<v Speaker 5>You can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't imagine he left a better version</v>

3273
03:10:19.391 --> 03:10:20.830
<v Speaker 5>on the table somewhere saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nope.</v>

3274
03:10:20.890 --> 03:10:25.890
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't believe that because the </v>

3275
03:10:25.890 --> 03:10:25.890
<v Speaker 5>one he used is so awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

3276
03:10:25.890 --> 03:10:27.640
<v Speaker 5>is it believable?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem here.</v>

3277
03:10:27.641 --> 03:10:31.090
<v Speaker 5>Nobody knows what's believable off the </v>
<v Speaker 5>top of my head,</v>

3278
03:10:31.091 --> 03:10:35.360
<v Speaker 5>if you asked me what percentage bought </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the general idea of Hirata story,</v>

3279
03:10:35.430 --> 03:10:40.430
<v Speaker 5>I'd say it's like 80 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most of them don't believe any of the </v>

3280
03:10:40.430 --> 03:10:41.980
<v Speaker 5>details,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the broad idea that in 5:30</v>

3281
03:10:41.981 --> 03:10:46.981
<v Speaker 5>bce,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cyrus the great died somewhere out in </v>

3282
03:10:46.981 --> 03:10:48.280
<v Speaker 5>this step area as Hurghada to said </v>
<v Speaker 5>details,</v>

3283
03:10:48.281 --> 03:10:52.360
<v Speaker 5>probably unknown about 20 percent I'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

3284
03:10:52.361 --> 03:10:57.361
<v Speaker 5>of the historians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't think he died a completely </v>

3285
03:10:57.361 --> 03:10:57.361
<v Speaker 5>different way.</v>

3286
03:10:57.361 --> 03:10:58.540
<v Speaker 5>Something against different tribes than </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hirata says in different areas.</v>

3287
03:10:58.720 --> 03:11:00.250
<v Speaker 5>Others that he didn't die that way at </v>
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>

3288
03:11:00.270 --> 03:11:02.320
<v Speaker 5>Xenophon renting a couple centuries </v>
<v Speaker 5>afterwards,</v>

3289
03:11:02.321 --> 03:11:07.321
<v Speaker 5>we'll say died in bed peacefully.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there are some historians who buy </v>

3290
03:11:07.321 --> 03:11:07.420
<v Speaker 5>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In Iran,</v>

3291
03:11:07.421 --> 03:11:12.421
<v Speaker 5>it's a generally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a higher percentage of </v>

3292
03:11:12.421 --> 03:11:12.421
<v Speaker 5>historians that think he didn't die the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way Heraclitus says,</v>

3293
03:11:12.650 --> 03:11:15.280
<v Speaker 5>and in part you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can understand why you'd be a little</v>

3294
03:11:15.281 --> 03:11:20.281
<v Speaker 5>skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just too darn interesting the way </v>

3295
03:11:20.281 --> 03:11:20.281
<v Speaker 5>he does it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can see,</v>

3296
03:11:20.550 --> 03:11:25.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the admonition that I got when I was </v>

3297
03:11:25.550 --> 03:11:25.550
<v Speaker 5>starting in journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the one that said,</v>

3298
03:11:25.550 --> 03:11:29.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tell what really happened in the most </v>

3299
03:11:29.300 --> 03:11:31.630
<v Speaker 5>interesting way possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happens to an admonition like that?</v>

3300
03:11:31.990 --> 03:11:35.200
<v Speaker 5>If there's no way you could possibly </v>
<v Speaker 5>know what really happened,</v>

3301
03:11:35.800 --> 03:11:38.680
<v Speaker 5>but you have to tell it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are your standards?</v>

3302
03:11:38.681 --> 03:11:43.681
<v Speaker 5>Then?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're pretty much left with the most </v>

3303
03:11:43.681 --> 03:11:43.681
<v Speaker 5>interesting way you can at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3304
03:11:44.650 --> 03:11:48.130
<v Speaker 5>The story is herodotus tells,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it involves this little twist.</v>

3305
03:11:48.131 --> 03:11:53.131
<v Speaker 5>You're going to end up leaving his </v>
<v Speaker 5>theatrical presentation with a deeper </v>

3306
03:11:53.131 --> 03:11:53.320
<v Speaker 5>message.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

3307
03:11:53.321 --> 03:11:58.321
<v Speaker 5>the deeper message may or may not be </v>
<v Speaker 5>true Hurghada this couches this story </v>

3308
03:11:58.321 --> 03:12:02.041
<v Speaker 5>now into the ID of overreach.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe the idea of absolute power </v>

3309
03:12:02.041 --> 03:12:04.930
<v Speaker 5>corrupts absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and before we write this off,</v>

3310
03:12:05.110 --> 03:12:08.530
<v Speaker 5>as many historians do right away because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just such an obvious moral message.</v>

3311
03:12:08.650 --> 03:12:11.200
<v Speaker 5>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could make that case about Hitler.</v>

3312
03:12:11.810 --> 03:12:16.810
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the absolute power turning you mad </v>

3313
03:12:16.810 --> 03:12:17.020
<v Speaker 5>after awhile with Alexander,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can make that case.</v>

3314
03:12:17.021 --> 03:12:22.021
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess there are historical figures </v>

3315
03:12:22.021 --> 03:12:24.540
<v Speaker 5>where this is both a motif because it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>this recurring theme you see all the </v>

3316
03:12:24.540 --> 03:12:24.970
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it also happens to be true.</v>

3317
03:12:25.750 --> 03:12:29.650
<v Speaker 5>Maybe after years of being king of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>universe,</v>

3318
03:12:30.040 --> 03:12:32.140
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus got a little full of himself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who knows,</v>

3319
03:12:32.141 --> 03:12:33.610
<v Speaker 5>but that's the way this is portrayed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3320
03:12:33.611 --> 03:12:38.611
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be an object lesson </v>
<v Speaker 5>here and the person that is going to </v>

3321
03:12:38.611 --> 03:12:40.690
<v Speaker 5>stick it to cyrus and teach him this </v>
<v Speaker 5>lesson is going to be a queen,</v>

3322
03:12:41.570 --> 03:12:46.570
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you have to think of like an </v>

3323
03:12:46.570 --> 03:12:47.851
<v Speaker 5>Amazonian Queen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This isn't some woman who's walking </v>

3324
03:12:47.851 --> 03:12:47.851
<v Speaker 5>around in velvet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3325
03:12:47.851 --> 03:12:52.141
<v Speaker 5>on a throne being fan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is a person who probably </v>

3326
03:12:52.141 --> 03:12:52.190
<v Speaker 5>once upon a time was killing</v>

3327
03:12:52.190 --> 03:12:56.270
<v Speaker 2>men in hand to hand combat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

3328
03:12:56.271 --> 03:12:59.780
<v Speaker 2>did this woman really exist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who the heck knows?</v>

3329
03:12:59.781 --> 03:13:02.750
<v Speaker 2>There is no historical confirmation that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen that says that they found</v>

3330
03:13:02.751 --> 03:13:05.240
<v Speaker 2>anything that proves this queen who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>name,</v>

3331
03:13:05.241 --> 03:13:10.241
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to call her tomorrow when I was </v>

3332
03:13:10.241 --> 03:13:10.241
<v Speaker 2>growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen timorous,</v>

3333
03:13:10.241 --> 03:13:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Tom Morris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>number of different pronunciations.</v>

3334
03:13:12.020 --> 03:13:13.990
<v Speaker 2>I think Shakespeare might've used her as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a character,</v>

3335
03:13:14.010 --> 03:13:16.730
<v Speaker 2>one of his plays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

3336
03:13:16.731 --> 03:13:18.410
<v Speaker 2>you can say a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

3337
03:13:18.800 --> 03:13:22.460
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't have been outrageous to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think of her as a female warrior because</v>

3338
03:13:22.461 --> 03:13:27.461
<v Speaker 2>these tribes actually had them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may have been the actual root of the </v>

3339
03:13:28.440 --> 03:13:33.440
<v Speaker 2>idea of Amazon's in sort of a mythology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she could have actually been a killer</v>

3340
03:13:35.911 --> 03:13:40.911
<v Speaker 2>warrior and also the tribe she was </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to have lead was real all too </v>

3341
03:13:42.481 --> 03:13:47.481
<v Speaker 2>real to some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were called the master guitar or </v>

3342
03:13:47.481 --> 03:13:49.040
<v Speaker 2>the message tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A dangerous,</v>

3343
03:13:49.041 --> 03:13:53.270
<v Speaker 2>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>numerous tribal coalition that,</v>

3344
03:13:54.010 --> 03:13:55.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hurghada is in his writings.</v>

3345
03:13:55.791 --> 03:13:57.710
<v Speaker 2>He has to set it up and tell you what he</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows,</v>

3346
03:13:57.711 --> 03:13:58.440
<v Speaker 2>which isn't much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3347
03:13:58.490 --> 03:14:00.710
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear there a skiffy in people,</v>

3348
03:14:00.711 --> 03:14:01.730
<v Speaker 2>which they kind of were.</v>

3349
03:14:03.480 --> 03:14:06.960
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to think of Mongolia type </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

3350
03:14:07.410 --> 03:14:12.410
<v Speaker 2>but with people who were probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>predominantly light skinned and ranging </v>

3351
03:14:13.891 --> 03:14:18.891
<v Speaker 2>on the scale of looks from like a Turkic</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of look all the way up to people </v>

3352
03:14:18.891 --> 03:14:23.010
<v Speaker 2>with blonde and red hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blue and green eyes tall.</v>

3353
03:14:23.580 --> 03:14:28.580
<v Speaker 2>There's a little viking side to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of the Viking Ethos and </v>

3354
03:14:28.580 --> 03:14:29.550
<v Speaker 2>building little sword worshiping and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>

3355
03:14:29.551 --> 03:14:33.480
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly once a year these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have a scaffold erected and they'd</v>

3356
03:14:33.481 --> 03:14:36.100
<v Speaker 2>put a sword on top of the scaffolding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they would march in,</v>

3357
03:14:36.150 --> 03:14:39.180
<v Speaker 2>meet the scaffold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One out of every 100 prisoners that they</v>

3358
03:14:39.181 --> 03:14:43.620
<v Speaker 2>captured over the year and execute them </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a sacrifice to the sky.</v>

3359
03:14:43.621 --> 03:14:44.400
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the son,</v>

3360
03:14:44.401 --> 03:14:45.990
<v Speaker 2>God Mithras,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was.</v>

3361
03:14:47.310 --> 03:14:49.620
<v Speaker 2>These are colorful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scary people.</v>

3362
03:14:49.621 --> 03:14:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Just what you want in a story like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran,</v>

3363
03:14:51.990 --> 03:14:54.580
<v Speaker 2>this has already talked about their head</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting.</v>

3364
03:14:54.960 --> 03:14:56.760
<v Speaker 2>The fact that they make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3365
03:14:56.761 --> 03:15:01.761
<v Speaker 2>drinking cups out of skulls and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>really nasty warriors are the ones with </v>

3366
03:15:01.761 --> 03:15:01.761
<v Speaker 2>the most cops.</v>

3367
03:15:02.580 --> 03:15:05.010
<v Speaker 2>He talks about their cannabis use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

3368
03:15:05.040 --> 03:15:07.470
<v Speaker 2>this was the exotic barbarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to hear what they do.</v>

3369
03:15:07.740 --> 03:15:12.740
<v Speaker 2>He says they found this fruit that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can burn and then they sit around the </v>

3370
03:15:12.740 --> 03:15:16.161
<v Speaker 2>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>burning the fruit and it gets them </v>

3371
03:15:16.161 --> 03:15:16.161
<v Speaker 2>intoxicated like wine gets Greeks </v>
<v Speaker 2>intoxicated.</v>

3372
03:15:16.161 --> 03:15:18.660
<v Speaker 2>So another little bit of that barbarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>colored to throw in.</v>

3373
03:15:19.290 --> 03:15:23.160
<v Speaker 2>He also points out according to him that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are very promiscuous.</v>

3374
03:15:23.161 --> 03:15:28.161
<v Speaker 2>You might call them free love types or </v>
<v Speaker 2>swinger is maybe anybody can sleep with </v>

3375
03:15:28.161 --> 03:15:30.330
<v Speaker 2>anybody else's wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just has to put his bow,</v>

3376
03:15:30.600 --> 03:15:35.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alongside their tend to let them know </v>

3377
03:15:35.600 --> 03:15:36.510
<v Speaker 2>you're interested I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So weed,</v>

3378
03:15:36.511 --> 03:15:39.600
<v Speaker 2>smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>headhunting blood drinking,</v>

3379
03:15:39.601 --> 03:15:41.100
<v Speaker 2>wife sharing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Viking types.</v>

3380
03:15:41.101 --> 03:15:46.101
<v Speaker 2>Who would not want that in a good story </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know anything and you're </v>

3381
03:15:46.101 --> 03:15:49.911
<v Speaker 2>just trying to make the best story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure you include these people are </v>

3382
03:15:49.911 --> 03:15:50.190
<v Speaker 2>test that Cyrus leads</v>

3383
03:15:50.190 --> 03:15:55.190
<v Speaker 5>and army up to this queens territory and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then basically proposes marriage to her </v>

3384
03:15:56.070 --> 03:15:58.350
<v Speaker 5>so it would be like a diplomatic </v>
<v Speaker 5>alliance thing.</v>

3385
03:15:58.351 --> 03:16:03.351
<v Speaker 5>And in Hurghada this says that she sees </v>
<v Speaker 5>through this reus immediately saying </v>

3386
03:16:03.351 --> 03:16:05.430
<v Speaker 5>that he just wants to conquer her people</v>
<v Speaker 5>by marrying her.</v>

3387
03:16:06.630 --> 03:16:11.190
<v Speaker 5>So then when she says no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he begins to try to set up what we would</v>

3388
03:16:11.191 --> 03:16:16.191
<v Speaker 5>call today an amphibious river crossing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a big river that divides the </v>

3389
03:16:16.191 --> 03:16:16.350
<v Speaker 5>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's coming from,</v>

3390
03:16:16.710 --> 03:16:21.710
<v Speaker 5>from the territory of these Central </v>
<v Speaker 5>Asian horse nomads up in places like </v>

3391
03:16:21.720 --> 03:16:26.720
<v Speaker 5>Kazakhstan and places like that today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And as Cyrus and the Persians were told,</v>

3392
03:16:27.241 --> 03:16:30.270
<v Speaker 5>are building these boats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of which have like towers,</v>

3393
03:16:30.271 --> 03:16:33.480
<v Speaker 5>like fighting towers on them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She sends him a message.</v>

3394
03:16:33.481 --> 03:16:38.481
<v Speaker 5>Now remember,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's going to be like the voice of </v>

3395
03:16:38.481 --> 03:16:40.740
<v Speaker 5>Avenging Karma here in teaching cyrus a </v>
<v Speaker 5>lesson.</v>

3396
03:16:40.920 --> 03:16:42.910
<v Speaker 5>So her voice and the words that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>brought,</v>

3397
03:16:42.911 --> 03:16:44.410
<v Speaker 5>it just puts in her mouth from a screen.</v>

3398
03:16:44.410 --> 03:16:49.410
<v Speaker 5>Writers show runners point of view are </v>
<v Speaker 5>designed to set this idea up right?</v>

3399
03:16:50.070 --> 03:16:51.720
<v Speaker 5>You should know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you don't.</v>

3400
03:16:51.721 --> 03:16:53.160
<v Speaker 5>You know you're going to get what's </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming to you.</v>

3401
03:16:53.161 --> 03:16:58.161
<v Speaker 5>Here's what Hirata to says.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the discipline core translation </v>

3402
03:16:58.161 --> 03:16:58.161
<v Speaker 5>of her audit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

3403
03:16:58.161 --> 03:17:00.510
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote King of the Medes,</v>

3404
03:17:00.720 --> 03:17:05.720
<v Speaker 5>I advise you to abandon this enterprise </v>
<v Speaker 5>for you cannot know if in the end it </v>

3405
03:17:05.720 --> 03:17:10.251
<v Speaker 5>will do you any good rule your own </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and try to bear the sight of me </v>

3406
03:17:10.251 --> 03:17:14.841
<v Speaker 5>ruling mine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but of course you will refuse my advice </v>

3407
03:17:14.841 --> 03:17:15.120
<v Speaker 5>as the last thing you wish for us to </v>
<v Speaker 5>live in.</v>

3408
03:17:15.121 --> 03:17:16.740
<v Speaker 5>Peace listened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then.</v>

3409
03:17:17.010 --> 03:17:20.670
<v Speaker 5>If you are so bent upon trying your </v>
<v Speaker 5>strength against the massacre tie,</v>

3410
03:17:20.970 --> 03:17:25.970
<v Speaker 5>give up the laborious task of building </v>
<v Speaker 5>that bridge and let my army withdraw </v>

3411
03:17:25.970 --> 03:17:27.060
<v Speaker 5>three days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>March from the river,</v>

3412
03:17:27.180 --> 03:17:29.940
<v Speaker 5>and then you come over yourself or if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you prefer it,</v>

3413
03:17:30.210 --> 03:17:35.210
<v Speaker 5>retire the same distance yourselves and </v>
<v Speaker 5>let us meet you on your side of the </v>

3414
03:17:35.210 --> 03:17:39.081
<v Speaker 5>river and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this barbarian Warrior Queen is </v>

3415
03:17:41.971 --> 03:17:46.971
<v Speaker 5>basically saying to a guy whose title </v>
<v Speaker 5>includes king of kings and King of the </v>

3416
03:17:46.971 --> 03:17:51.921
<v Speaker 5>universe to come and get it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or I'll come over and take it from you.</v>

3417
03:17:54.090 --> 03:17:56.970
<v Speaker 5>That's a pretty strong female character,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>

3418
03:17:57.300 --> 03:18:02.300
<v Speaker 5>And I was thinking that it makes </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hurghada to at times look a little pro </v>

3419
03:18:02.300 --> 03:18:02.300
<v Speaker 5>feminist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3420
03:18:02.300 --> 03:18:02.880
<v Speaker 5>Like he like he's been looking for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>good,</v>

3421
03:18:02.881 --> 03:18:07.881
<v Speaker 5>strong female character.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's another reason maybe that would </v>

3422
03:18:07.881 --> 03:18:09.870
<v Speaker 5>play well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe some of the people in his audience</v>

3423
03:18:09.871 --> 03:18:14.871
<v Speaker 5>are women and it would be good to have a</v>
<v Speaker 5>character that they can both relate to </v>

3424
03:18:14.871 --> 03:18:15.720
<v Speaker 5>in cheer for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Finally,</v>

3425
03:18:15.721 --> 03:18:19.710
<v Speaker 5>it might just be a dig at the manliness </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the Persians,</v>

3426
03:18:19.711 --> 03:18:20.400
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3427
03:18:20.790 --> 03:18:25.790
<v Speaker 5>here's the greatest king that Asia has </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever produced and he's about to be </v>

3428
03:18:25.790 --> 03:18:29.871
<v Speaker 5>beaten and killed by a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nonetheless in the story when she says,</v>

3429
03:18:30.431 --> 03:18:31.620
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you want it over here?</v>

3430
03:18:31.621 --> 03:18:35.220
<v Speaker 5>Do you want it over there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cyrus in his generals and whatnot,</v>

3431
03:18:35.221 --> 03:18:36.690
<v Speaker 5>sit down and have a conference about </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

3432
03:18:36.691 --> 03:18:38.280
<v Speaker 5>What do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which choice do we take in?</v>

3433
03:18:38.281 --> 03:18:40.710
<v Speaker 5>All his advisors say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let her come to our side of the river.</v>

3434
03:18:41.010 --> 03:18:42.420
<v Speaker 5>One advisor though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>says,</v>

3435
03:18:42.421 --> 03:18:42.710
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3436
03:18:42.711 --> 03:18:44.040
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go over to her side.</v>

3437
03:18:44.400 --> 03:18:48.010
<v Speaker 5>That advisor is our old friend,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the king of Lydia</v>

3438
03:18:48.010 --> 03:18:50.980
<v Speaker 2>creases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who instead of being killed Hurghada.</v>

3439
03:18:50.981 --> 03:18:51.850
<v Speaker 2>This has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3440
03:18:51.851 --> 03:18:56.851
<v Speaker 2>going in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of acting as advisor to Cyrus all </v>

3441
03:18:56.851 --> 03:18:56.851
<v Speaker 2>the way through</v>

3442
03:18:57.140 --> 03:18:59.270
<v Speaker 2>increases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His advice is totally different.</v>

3443
03:19:00.020 --> 03:19:00.680
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

3444
03:19:00.681 --> 03:19:03.590
<v Speaker 2>you can't let her come over here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>give grounded in front of her.</v>

3445
03:19:03.591 --> 03:19:05.090
<v Speaker 2>It's a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would look terrible.</v>

3446
03:19:05.091 --> 03:19:08.060
<v Speaker 2>So there's that other little dig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

3447
03:19:08.061 --> 03:19:11.240
<v Speaker 2>go over to her side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he says,</v>

3448
03:19:11.630 --> 03:19:16.630
<v Speaker 2>and how about we do a little trick and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he proceeds to tell Cyrus that they </v>

3449
03:19:19.011 --> 03:19:24.011
<v Speaker 2>should essentially do the same thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people that the medes did to </v>

3450
03:19:24.440 --> 03:19:29.440
<v Speaker 2>either these people are their cousins a </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation before in a story you may </v>

3451
03:19:29.440 --> 03:19:32.060
<v Speaker 2>recall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get them all drunk and kill them.</v>

3452
03:19:33.320 --> 03:19:36.560
<v Speaker 2>My discipline core translation has </v>
<v Speaker 2>creases,</v>

3453
03:19:36.590 --> 03:19:41.590
<v Speaker 2>telling Cyrus to do it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quote here then is my advice crossed the</v>

3454
03:19:42.501 --> 03:19:47.501
<v Speaker 2>river advanced to the limit of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>enemy's withdrawal and then get the </v>

3455
03:19:47.501 --> 03:19:48.200
<v Speaker 2>better of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buy a piece of strategy.</v>

3456
03:19:48.530 --> 03:19:53.530
<v Speaker 2>I have heard that these people have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience of such luxuries as the </v>

3457
03:19:53.530 --> 03:19:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Persians and joy and know nothing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pleasures of life.</v>

3458
03:19:56.060 --> 03:20:01.060
<v Speaker 2>Let us take advantage of this fact and </v>
<v Speaker 2>set out a banquet in our camp on the </v>

3459
03:20:01.060 --> 03:20:05.831
<v Speaker 2>most generous scale with a great many </v>
<v Speaker 2>sheep slaughtered and dressed all sorts </v>

3460
03:20:05.831 --> 03:20:10.130
<v Speaker 2>of other dishes and bowls of strong wine</v>
<v Speaker 2>in liberal quantities.</v>

3461
03:20:10.550 --> 03:20:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Then when the banquet is all prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

3462
03:20:13.580 --> 03:20:18.580
<v Speaker 2>let us March back to the river,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaving only a detachment of inferior </v>

3463
03:20:18.580 --> 03:20:22.751
<v Speaker 2>troops behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless I'm very much mistaken when our </v>

3464
03:20:22.751 --> 03:20:26.171
<v Speaker 2>enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See all those good things they will set </v>

3465
03:20:26.171 --> 03:20:28.901
<v Speaker 2>to work upon them and that will be our </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance to distinguish ourselves by a </v>

3466
03:20:28.901 --> 03:20:32.621
<v Speaker 2>bold stroke and quote again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a recurring motif or is that </v>

3467
03:20:33.441 --> 03:20:36.290
<v Speaker 2>just a tactic that seems to work quite a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit?</v>

3468
03:20:36.291 --> 03:20:41.291
<v Speaker 2>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the story we're told that the a </v>

3469
03:20:41.291 --> 03:20:45.170
<v Speaker 2>third of the army shows up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kills the inferior troops,</v>

3470
03:20:45.290 --> 03:20:47.840
<v Speaker 2>sees all the food and the wine proceeds </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get,</v>

3471
03:20:48.400 --> 03:20:50.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very full and very drunk,</v>

3472
03:20:50.031 --> 03:20:53.300
<v Speaker 2>and then the Persians come in and kill a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of them and capture some others.</v>

3473
03:20:53.301 --> 03:20:58.301
<v Speaker 2>About a third of the army according to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hurghada tests included amongst the </v>

3474
03:20:58.301 --> 03:21:03.131
<v Speaker 2>prisoners a general who also happens to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be this barbarian queens son.</v>

3475
03:21:06.020 --> 03:21:09.260
<v Speaker 2>So now in this scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hurghada is playing with his movies,</v>

3476
03:21:09.261 --> 03:21:14.261
<v Speaker 2>turned into a little bit of a thriller </v>
<v Speaker 2>with little chest match and all of a </v>

3477
03:21:14.261 --> 03:21:15.140
<v Speaker 2>sudden the cyrus's side is captured a </v>
<v Speaker 2>major piece,</v>

3478
03:21:15.680 --> 03:21:19.670
<v Speaker 2>the son of the Queen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so she issues one of these.</v>

3479
03:21:20.390 --> 03:21:25.390
<v Speaker 2>I'll let you go now if you give me back </v>
<v Speaker 2>my son kinds of speeches from the </v>

3480
03:21:25.941 --> 03:21:28.340
<v Speaker 2>pervious translation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought it to says,</v>

3481
03:21:28.341 --> 03:21:33.341
<v Speaker 2>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when to my wrist learned what had </v>

3482
03:21:33.341 --> 03:21:35.621
<v Speaker 2>happened to her army and her son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She sent a herald to Cyrus with this </v>

3483
03:21:35.621 --> 03:21:37.040
<v Speaker 2>message,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood thirsty cyrus.</v>

3484
03:21:37.190 --> 03:21:39.440
<v Speaker 2>Do not gloat over what has happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

3485
03:21:39.590 --> 03:21:44.590
<v Speaker 2>You Persians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indulge yourself with the fruit of the </v>

3486
03:21:44.590 --> 03:21:46.550
<v Speaker 2>vine to the point of madness so that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wine into your bodies,</v>

3487
03:21:46.730 --> 03:21:51.730
<v Speaker 5>ugly words flow up and out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By such means you have tricked me and </v>

3488
03:21:51.730 --> 03:21:52.640
<v Speaker 5>you've taken my son,</v>
<v Speaker 5>prisoner,</v>

3489
03:21:52.820 --> 03:21:57.820
<v Speaker 5>but not by supremacy and battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well then I urge you to follow this </v>

3490
03:21:57.820 --> 03:21:59.450
<v Speaker 5>advice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Return my son to me.</v>

3491
03:21:59.600 --> 03:22:04.600
<v Speaker 5>And despite the damage you have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cunningly wreaked upon a third part of </v>

3492
03:22:04.600 --> 03:22:07.901
<v Speaker 5>the army of the massacre tie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You may leave this land unharmed if you </v>

3493
03:22:07.901 --> 03:22:09.530
<v Speaker 5>do not do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I swear by the sun,</v>

3494
03:22:09.531 --> 03:22:14.531
<v Speaker 5>the Lord of the massacre.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tie that I will satisfy your thirst for </v>

3495
03:22:14.531 --> 03:22:14.531
<v Speaker 5>blood in.</v>

3496
03:22:14.531 --> 03:22:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Well as you are in quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what Cyrus going to do with this </v>

3497
03:22:19.621 --> 03:22:22.500
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful chest piece.</v>

3498
03:22:23.850 --> 03:22:28.850
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't get the chance to decide </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're told that as soon as the </v>

3499
03:22:28.850 --> 03:22:31.430
<v Speaker 2>queen's son sobers up finds himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3500
03:22:31.470 --> 03:22:36.150
<v Speaker 2>hands tied or bound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He beseeches cyrus to undo his hands.</v>

3501
03:22:36.810 --> 03:22:41.810
<v Speaker 2>Somehow Cyrus is convinced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I like the way my relevance and </v>

3502
03:22:41.810 --> 03:22:43.680
<v Speaker 2>translation puts it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The minute his hands were free,</v>

3503
03:22:43.681 --> 03:22:47.130
<v Speaker 2>Rawlinsons Hurghada to says he destroyed</v>
<v Speaker 2>himself,</v>

3504
03:22:48.390 --> 03:22:51.540
<v Speaker 2>so he committed suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now all of a sudden,</v>

3505
03:22:51.750 --> 03:22:56.750
<v Speaker 2>cyrus just lost his piece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is when we're told the battle </v>

3506
03:22:57.301 --> 03:23:02.301
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This from the discipline core </v>

3507
03:23:02.301 --> 03:23:02.301
<v Speaker 2>translation quote,</v>

3508
03:23:02.990 --> 03:23:06.170
<v Speaker 5>the queen on hearing that Cyrus ignored </v>
<v Speaker 5>her terms,</v>

3509
03:23:06.290 --> 03:23:09.500
<v Speaker 5>engaged him in the field with all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>forces she possessed,</v>

3510
03:23:09.740 --> 03:23:14.740
<v Speaker 5>the battle which followed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I judged to have been more violent than </v>

3511
03:23:14.740 --> 03:23:15.080
<v Speaker 5>any other fought between foreign </v>
<v Speaker 5>nations.</v>

3512
03:23:15.410 --> 03:23:17.300
<v Speaker 5>According to the information that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>have.</v>

3513
03:23:17.420 --> 03:23:22.420
<v Speaker 5>The engagement began with the two armies</v>
<v Speaker 5>coming to a halt within range of each </v>

3514
03:23:22.420 --> 03:23:25.910
<v Speaker 5>other and exchanging shots with bows and</v>
<v Speaker 5>arrows until their arrows were used up,</v>

3515
03:23:26.210 --> 03:23:30.530
<v Speaker 5>after which there was a long period of </v>
<v Speaker 5>close fighting with spears and daggers,</v>

3516
03:23:30.680 --> 03:23:33.260
<v Speaker 5>neither side being willing to retreat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Finally,</v>

3517
03:23:33.261 --> 03:23:35.960
<v Speaker 5>however,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the massacre Gutei got the upper hand.</v>

3518
03:23:36.110 --> 03:23:41.110
<v Speaker 5>The greater part of the Persian army was</v>
<v Speaker 5>destroyed where it stood and Cyrus </v>

3519
03:23:41.110 --> 03:23:43.910
<v Speaker 5>himself was killed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had been on the throne for 29 years</v>

3520
03:23:43.920 --> 03:23:45.630
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to quote,</v>

3521
03:23:47.070 --> 03:23:52.070
<v Speaker 2>of course that doesn't quite twist the </v>
<v Speaker 2>knife enough and have you leaving the </v>

3522
03:23:53.221 --> 03:23:58.221
<v Speaker 2>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really thinking about some of the </v>

3523
03:23:58.221 --> 03:24:00.801
<v Speaker 2>greater themes in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hirata tests from my pervious </v>

3524
03:24:00.801 --> 03:24:05.421
<v Speaker 2>translation adds a Coda to the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He writes,</v>

3525
03:24:05.491 --> 03:24:05.940
<v Speaker 2>quote,</v>

3526
03:24:06.830 --> 03:24:11.830
<v Speaker 5>queen terrorists then filled a wine skin</v>
<v Speaker 5>with human blood and searched for the </v>

3527
03:24:11.830 --> 03:24:13.520
<v Speaker 5>corpse of Cyrus amongst the Persian </v>
<v Speaker 5>dead.</v>

3528
03:24:13.850 --> 03:24:17.150
<v Speaker 5>When she found him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she thrust his head into the wine skin,</v>

3529
03:24:17.360 --> 03:24:20.300
<v Speaker 5>and as she does abused the corpse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she declared to it,</v>

3530
03:24:20.690 --> 03:24:23.420
<v Speaker 5>I am alive and if conquered you in </v>
<v Speaker 5>battle,</v>

3531
03:24:23.600 --> 03:24:26.690
<v Speaker 5>but you have ruined me by taking my son </v>
<v Speaker 5>through guile.</v>

3532
03:24:26.990 --> 03:24:30.350
<v Speaker 5>Well then just as I threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will slake your thirst</v>

3533
03:24:30.590 --> 03:24:35.590
<v Speaker 2>blood and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if as the recurring Greek motif will </v>

3534
03:24:37.881 --> 03:24:40.970
<v Speaker 2>later show that the Persians are surreal</v>
<v Speaker 2>overreaches,</v>

3535
03:24:42.290 --> 03:24:47.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure Hurghada does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His attitude here is that they should </v>

3536
03:24:47.290 --> 03:24:49.761
<v Speaker 2>have learned their lesson with cyrus by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time cyrus exits the scene,</v>

3537
03:24:50.541 --> 03:24:55.541
<v Speaker 2>though he's built an empire that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stretches from modern day Pakistan all </v>

3538
03:24:57.141 --> 03:25:02.141
<v Speaker 2>the way to the Mediterranean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been to Turkey down by the Red Sea </v>

3539
03:25:02.141 --> 03:25:07.031
<v Speaker 2>to the borders of Egypt and out to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Central Asian step when he's taken you </v>

3540
03:25:08.920 --> 03:25:12.080
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>efforts and spent years organizing it in</v>

3541
03:25:12.081 --> 03:25:16.640
<v Speaker 2>putting it in a form where it has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance to live on after he's gone.</v>

3542
03:25:17.810 --> 03:25:22.810
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot lose a person of that </v>

3543
03:25:22.810 --> 03:25:22.810
<v Speaker 2>magnitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot lose an Alexander.</v>

3544
03:25:22.810 --> 03:25:27.761
<v Speaker 2>You cannot lose an Napoleon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot lose and have these people </v>

3545
03:25:27.761 --> 03:25:30.401
<v Speaker 2>from such lofty heights removed from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>scene without there being this huge </v>

3546
03:25:30.401 --> 03:25:34.601
<v Speaker 2>vacuum a couple of hundred years after </v>
<v Speaker 2>this time period,</v>

3547
03:25:36.820 --> 03:25:41.820
<v Speaker 2>one of the people who will fill a vacuum</v>
<v Speaker 2>and play a similar role and maybe </v>

3548
03:25:42.191 --> 03:25:47.191
<v Speaker 2>eclipse this person will visit his tomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alexander the great along with some </v>

3549
03:25:49.571 --> 03:25:54.571
<v Speaker 2>influential colleagues will go to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spot and the building that is assumed to</v>

3550
03:25:55.361 --> 03:25:57.130
<v Speaker 2>be the tomb of Cyrus the great.</v>

3551
03:25:58.920 --> 03:26:02.610
<v Speaker 2>That tomb is still standing by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in modern day Iran,</v>

3552
03:26:02.611 --> 03:26:07.611
<v Speaker 2>if indeed it was the tomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting to think of Alexander </v>

3553
03:26:07.611 --> 03:26:11.730
<v Speaker 2>climbing up there in a fully colorized </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical era now,</v>

3554
03:26:11.731 --> 03:26:16.731
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing with him people who will write </v>

3555
03:26:16.731 --> 03:26:16.731
<v Speaker 2>about it afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually have through another guy,</v>

3556
03:26:16.731 --> 03:26:19.710
<v Speaker 2>the writings of someone who was with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alexander and kind of describes what the</v>

3557
03:26:19.711 --> 03:26:22.500
<v Speaker 2>tune looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of clothing,</v>

3558
03:26:22.501 --> 03:26:24.600
<v Speaker 2>a lot of souvenirs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things that just sort of helped</v>

3559
03:26:24.601 --> 03:26:29.601
<v Speaker 2>the guy into the afterlife sort of deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a body that was preserved in </v>

3560
03:26:30.391 --> 03:26:32.330
<v Speaker 2>wax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're told this,</v>

3561
03:26:32.400 --> 03:26:34.290
<v Speaker 2>this was kind of a Persian custom too.</v>

3562
03:26:35.990 --> 03:26:39.380
<v Speaker 2>Now this might just be me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had this feeling that if the queen</v>

3563
03:26:39.381 --> 03:26:43.670
<v Speaker 2>of the massive Gd or the Messa di had </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken his head or something,</v>

3564
03:26:44.120 --> 03:26:48.260
<v Speaker 2>that's a mutilation that they would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably told us about.</v>

3565
03:26:48.261 --> 03:26:53.261
<v Speaker 2>It's probable that the body looked </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty darn good because no one talked </v>

3566
03:26:53.261 --> 03:26:55.880
<v Speaker 2>about it looking any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're told that there was an inscription</v>

3567
03:26:57.170 --> 03:27:02.170
<v Speaker 2>on the tomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now some historians think it must've </v>

3568
03:27:02.170 --> 03:27:02.170
<v Speaker 2>been in front of the tomb because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>missing,</v>

3569
03:27:02.170 --> 03:27:06.191
<v Speaker 2>but they were a couple of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>descriptions from people who supposedly </v>

3570
03:27:06.191 --> 03:27:07.520
<v Speaker 2>saw them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some are more flowery than others.</v>

3571
03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:13.000
<v Speaker 2>One that I liked that has a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different versions says quote mortal.</v>

3572
03:27:14.780 --> 03:27:19.780
<v Speaker 2>I am cyrus son of Cam by ses who founded</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Persian empire and was King of Asia.</v>

3573
03:27:20.930 --> 03:27:23.120
<v Speaker 2>Grudge me not then my monument</v>

3574
03:27:24.620 --> 03:27:29.620
<v Speaker 2>and the quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are other traditions also from</v>

3575
03:27:29.840 --> 03:27:34.840
<v Speaker 2>eyewitness accounts originally that </v>
<v Speaker 2>record a very different sort of epitaph.</v>

3576
03:27:36.890 --> 03:27:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Some of the historians are like say it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more traditionally Iranian to it's </v>

3577
03:27:41.890 --> 03:27:43.870
<v Speaker 2>much more pithy and right to the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Persians,</v>

3578
03:27:43.871 --> 03:27:48.871
<v Speaker 2>when they were leading the empire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could put on the airs as well as any </v>

3579
03:27:48.871 --> 03:27:52.111
<v Speaker 2>Mesopotamian dynasty ever did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could heap on all the traditional </v>

3580
03:27:52.111 --> 03:27:55.240
<v Speaker 2>titles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Queen Victoria had the empress of India.</v>

3581
03:27:55.720 --> 03:27:58.390
<v Speaker 2>The kings of this area had king of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe,</v>

3582
03:27:58.840 --> 03:28:01.780
<v Speaker 2>King of the four corners of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>King of lands,</v>

3583
03:28:01.800 --> 03:28:06.800
<v Speaker 2>and the Persians could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes when they were just </v>

3584
03:28:06.800 --> 03:28:10.231
<v Speaker 2>recording for eternity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what a tomb inscription like </v>

3585
03:28:10.231 --> 03:28:14.300
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they adopted a different style.</v>

3586
03:28:15.970 --> 03:28:20.970
<v Speaker 2>When the tomb inscription supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 2>from an eyewitness that I liked the </v>

3587
03:28:20.970 --> 03:28:21.100
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I like to use Cyrus's Persian,</v>

3588
03:28:21.101 --> 03:28:24.750
<v Speaker 2>he creek ish form of the name Kourosh or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kourosh.</v>

3589
03:28:25.780 --> 03:28:30.780
<v Speaker 2>It says here I lie Kourosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>king of kings.</v>

3590
03:28:40.740 --> 03:28:44.940
<v Speaker 2>The Persians grew up in the equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a tough neighborhood</v>

3591
03:28:46.690 --> 03:28:47.560
<v Speaker 2>to show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just heard,</v>

3592
03:28:47.561 --> 03:28:52.561
<v Speaker 2>involved a lot of context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't it where we discussed the </v>

3593
03:28:52.561 --> 03:28:53.170
<v Speaker 2>background,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they sprung from,</v>

3594
03:28:53.530 --> 03:28:55.240
<v Speaker 2>because this does a bunch of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

3595
03:28:55.241 --> 03:28:58.060
<v Speaker 2>it makes their achievements all the more</v>
<v Speaker 2>astounding.</v>

3596
03:28:59.170 --> 03:29:04.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean they arose in this world with all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these amazing competitors and manage to,</v>

3597
03:29:05.180 --> 03:29:06.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>climb to the top of the heap.</v>

3598
03:29:06.731 --> 03:29:11.731
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also helps us set a baseline for </v>

3599
03:29:11.731 --> 03:29:13.210
<v Speaker 2>comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we say things like the Persians are</v>

3600
03:29:13.690 --> 03:29:17.320
<v Speaker 2>tolerant or lenient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to immediately say,</v>

3601
03:29:17.321 --> 03:29:22.321
<v Speaker 2>compared to what the show you just heard</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives us some idea what they might be </v>

3602
03:29:23.021 --> 03:29:24.040
<v Speaker 2>compared to.</v>

3603
03:29:26.650 --> 03:29:28.540
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fantastic story.</v>

3604
03:29:28.541 --> 03:29:32.530
<v Speaker 2>This story that's usually relegated to </v>
<v Speaker 2>dead air between two other stories,</v>

3605
03:29:32.531 --> 03:29:37.531
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere between the fall of the Syria </v>

3606
03:29:37.531 --> 03:29:37.690
<v Speaker 2>and the rise of Persia is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3607
03:29:37.880 --> 03:29:41.320
<v Speaker 2>latter part of the six hundreds and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>high five,</v>

3608
03:29:41.321 --> 03:29:42.820
<v Speaker 2>85,</v>
<v Speaker 2>95,</v>

3609
03:29:42.821 --> 03:29:43.690
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>85.</v>

3610
03:29:43.691 --> 03:29:48.691
<v Speaker 2>What's going on during that era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Normally it's sort of just a transition </v>

3611
03:29:48.691 --> 03:29:48.990
<v Speaker 2>point between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3612
03:29:49.000 --> 03:29:54.000
<v Speaker 2>two chapters in a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas all by itself it's twisted and </v>

3613
03:29:54.000 --> 03:29:57.361
<v Speaker 2>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I love the idea of the great power </v>

3614
03:29:57.361 --> 03:30:00.511
<v Speaker 2>like the US or the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapsing and the rest of the world </v>

3615
03:30:00.511 --> 03:30:00.850
<v Speaker 2>sort of looking at each other over the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3616
03:30:01.060 --> 03:30:06.060
<v Speaker 2>smoke and ruins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out who gets what and </v>

3617
03:30:06.060 --> 03:30:06.060
<v Speaker 2>what are the things look like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

3618
03:30:06.060 --> 03:30:10.500
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The key to this whole story at this </v>

3619
03:30:10.500 --> 03:30:10.950
<v Speaker 2>point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3620
03:30:10.960 --> 03:30:14.560
<v Speaker 2>when it took such a singular figure to </v>
<v Speaker 2>put this improbable,</v>

3621
03:30:15.180 --> 03:30:16.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>event together.</v>

3622
03:30:16.450 --> 03:30:18.940
<v Speaker 2>What happens when that figure exits the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scene?</v>

3623
03:30:19.480 --> 03:30:22.810
<v Speaker 2>What are the odds of getting to Cyrus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the greats in the same family,</v>

3624
03:30:22.870 --> 03:30:24.160
<v Speaker 2>one right after another.</v>

3625
03:30:26.130 --> 03:30:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Remember this is the largest empire in </v>
<v Speaker 2>world history.</v>

3626
03:30:28.381 --> 03:30:30.960
<v Speaker 2>The distance from one part to another is</v>
<v Speaker 2>daunting.</v>

3627
03:30:31.740 --> 03:30:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Then you have all these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

3628
03:30:33.570 --> 03:30:38.430
<v Speaker 2>people that are very independent minded </v>
<v Speaker 2>and fractious and who gave the Assyrians</v>

3629
03:30:38.660 --> 03:30:42.770
<v Speaker 2>fits all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many different religions,</v>

3630
03:30:42.771 --> 03:30:47.771
<v Speaker 2>so many different languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How is in a one small minority of people</v>

3631
03:30:48.321 --> 03:30:53.321
<v Speaker 2>going to rule this giant entity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially without the specially gifted </v>

3632
03:30:53.321 --> 03:30:57.011
<v Speaker 2>guy who built the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the next episode we'll examine how </v>

3633
03:30:57.011 --> 03:31:01.920
<v Speaker 2>you combat isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The son of Cyrus manages all this and </v>

3634
03:31:01.941 --> 03:31:06.941
<v Speaker 2>they will be coups and there will </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially be armies disappearing in </v>

3635
03:31:06.941 --> 03:31:10.210
<v Speaker 2>sandstorms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There will be far too many Greeks </v>

3636
03:31:10.210 --> 03:31:10.730
<v Speaker 2>probably for what the story really </v>
<v Speaker 2>warrants,</v>

3637
03:31:11.240 --> 03:31:16.240
<v Speaker 2>but you have to understand while we all </v>
<v Speaker 2>know instinctively there important </v>

3638
03:31:16.240 --> 03:31:17.990
<v Speaker 2>things going on in the east and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>north and the other parts of the Persian</v>

3639
03:31:17.991 --> 03:31:21.830
<v Speaker 2>empire that don't touch Greek lands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only people writing about it in any</v>

3640
03:31:21.831 --> 03:31:25.000
<v Speaker 2>sort of extended colorful way are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Greek,</v>

3641
03:31:25.001 --> 03:31:30.001
<v Speaker 2>so just like everyone else will talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the Greek and Persian wars will </v>

3642
03:31:30.001 --> 03:31:33.551
<v Speaker 2>give some context of that battle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their monopoly movie scene with the </v>

3643
03:31:33.551 --> 03:31:33.551
<v Speaker 2>Spartan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

3644
03:31:33.551 --> 03:31:34.460
<v Speaker 2>come and take them</v>

3645
03:31:37.070 --> 03:31:42.070
<v Speaker 2>and then we'll deal with the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next guy really in this story,</v>

3646
03:31:42.471 --> 03:31:47.471
<v Speaker 2>who's personal talents are such that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a game changer all by himself.</v>

3647
03:31:48.230 --> 03:31:53.230
<v Speaker 2>The natural successor to Cyrus the great</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the person who finally puts the </v>

3648
03:31:53.230 --> 03:31:56.420
<v Speaker 2>stake in the heart of the black and </v>
<v Speaker 2>white world,</v>

3649
03:31:58.830 --> 03:32:03.830
<v Speaker 2>the son of Philip of Macedonia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that and more in the next episode of</v>

3650
03:32:06.811 --> 03:32:11.811
<v Speaker 2>kings of kings.</v>
