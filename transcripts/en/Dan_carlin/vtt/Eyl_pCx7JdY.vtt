00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.060
<v Speaker 1>What you're about to hear is part three </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a multipart series on the first world</v>

2
00:00:04.061 --> 00:00:09.061
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're one of those individual that </v>

3
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:09.061
<v Speaker 1>likes to know the story before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

4
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:11.350
<v Speaker 1>you might want to catch up on those if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you missed either one of them,</v>

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>although some of you probably don't mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>just being dropped into the middle of a </v>

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.191
<v Speaker 1>story like you arrived in the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine and you have to figure things </v>

7
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:23.041
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're one of those kind of </v>

8
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:24.011
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know who cares about those earlier </v>

9
00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>two shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just jump on in and </v>

10
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.690
<v Speaker 1>joining the horror in progress with </v>
<v Speaker 1>blueprint for Armageddon,</v>

11
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.440
<v Speaker 1>part three,</v>

12
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.390
<v Speaker 2>some bus seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

13
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.440
<v Speaker 2>41 date which will live in infamy.</v>

14
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Each one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the events</v>

15
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.850
<v Speaker 3>that dude,</v>

16
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 4>the figure is going to the lead on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and place.</v>

17
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.610
<v Speaker 4>I take pride in the words the Alina tear</v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

18
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

19
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.140
<v Speaker 3>Complete.</v>

20
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 4>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>welcome.</v>

21
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:30.441
<v Speaker 4>This kind of examination because people </v>
<v Speaker 4>have got to know whether or not their </v>

22
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:30.910
<v Speaker 4>question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

23
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a crop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we dig deep in our district and our </v>

24
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.910
<v Speaker 4>doctors and remember we are not </v>
<v Speaker 4>descended from fearful.</v>

25
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.240
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

26
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.400
<v Speaker 1>It's hardcore history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The very same week that the first world </v>

27
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 1>war breaks out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>August 19,</v>

28
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:58.761
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a British expedition leaves British </v>

29
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:02.991
<v Speaker 1>waters and heads for the South Pole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antarctica led by a guy named Ernest </v>

30
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.720
<v Speaker 1>Shackleton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shackleton is one of the people that's </v>

31
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 1>normally associated with the very tail </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of what's called the age of </v>

32
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the age of exploration,</v>

33
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.440
<v Speaker 1>and you know what's the tail end?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

34
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 1>unlike guys like Christopher Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shackleton and his crew have cameras.</v>

35
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bring a camera with you and he's </v>

36
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.330
<v Speaker 1>able to document in photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real clear,</v>

37
00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:30.331
<v Speaker 1>interesting photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This ordeal that he's about to </v>

38
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:33.001
<v Speaker 1>experience as he's on his way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Antarctica,</v>

39
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.300
<v Speaker 1>he's keeping tabs on this war that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>broken out right when he left.</v>

40
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:42.301
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is the first real period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>globalization and the world and he can </v>

41
00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:45.220
<v Speaker 1>keep track via telegraph of the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>major events that are going on</v>

42
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.820
<v Speaker 1>and like everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shackleton is appalled by the scale.</v>

43
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.400
<v Speaker 1>You can't believe the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties,</v>

44
00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:54.980
<v Speaker 1>the number of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the challenges involved in logistics.</v>

45
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.180
<v Speaker 1>It feels like this flame that is burning</v>
<v Speaker 1>at an unbelievable intensity.</v>

46
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>So everybody just assumed that couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue very long.</v>

47
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>That had been the assumption even before</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war broke out.</v>

48
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 1>The Kaiser famously says to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>departing troops,</v>

49
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:13.201
<v Speaker 1>you'll be home before the leaves fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the French military leader Joseph </v>

50
00:03:13.201 --> 00:03:17.841
<v Speaker 1>offer is told that his troops should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>issued metal helmets to replace those </v>

51
00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>cloth hats that they're starting the war</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

52
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't bother.</v>

53
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 1>They'll never reach the troops before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the war is over.</v>

54
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>So there's this real feeling that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's operating at that level</v>

55
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:31.321
<v Speaker 1>of intensity can't continue for very </v>
<v Speaker 1>long before shackleton gets to find out </v>

56
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:36.751
<v Speaker 1>how the whole thing ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though he in his ship and his crew get </v>

57
00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 1>trapped in the ice in the Antarctic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

58
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 1>photos exist.</v>

59
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.640
<v Speaker 1>It's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to watch the ship as it's </v>

60
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.831
<v Speaker 1>crushed by the ice and shackleton and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crew have to get out and basically </v>

61
00:03:46.831 --> 00:03:49.240
<v Speaker 1>live on the ice flows while they wait to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be rescued,</v>

62
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.920
<v Speaker 1>which is not happening fast enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he can see that his people are going</v>

63
00:03:52.921 --> 00:03:57.921
<v Speaker 1>to die out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If somebody doesn't do the really brave </v>

64
00:03:57.921 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 1>thing and take one of the little boats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

65
00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>the 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 footers off the big boat amounting to</v>

66
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>almost an open rowboat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not quite,</v>

67
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:09.841
<v Speaker 1>but almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he and a few crew members get in it </v>

68
00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:13.080
<v Speaker 1>and head out into the Arctic waters </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for land.</v>

69
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.750
<v Speaker 1>It's insane when you think about it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insane that he survived and in May </v>

70
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>

71
00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 1>he and these couple of guys that he set </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

72
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the Arctic with,</v>

73
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean with amazing stories of of </v>
<v Speaker 1>towering waves and all these things </v>

74
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.860
<v Speaker 1>stumbled into an isolated whaling </v>
<v Speaker 1>station on south Georgia island,</v>

75
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>which normally most of us would think as</v>
<v Speaker 1>penguin territory.</v>

76
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>It must've seemed positively Balmy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shackleton and his crew,</v>

77
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.510
<v Speaker 1>who by this time looked like bigfoot or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like a missing link.</v>

78
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Totally sunburned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The beards on their faces,</v>

79
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:54.631
<v Speaker 1>frozen and icicles hanging off them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were originally wearing animal </v>

80
00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:59.371
<v Speaker 1>skins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those skins did not like the salt </v>

81
00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 1>water very much and had melted and were </v>
<v Speaker 1>rotting and smelled and were falling off</v>

82
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

83
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.960
<v Speaker 1>the first thing they do when they get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whaling stations scare the heck out</v>

84
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 1>of two boys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of 12 year olds or something,</v>

85
00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:10.810
<v Speaker 1>see them first and go off running and </v>
<v Speaker 1>who could blame him?</v>

86
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Eventually though the adults come </v>
<v Speaker 1>running,</v>

87
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.710
<v Speaker 1>shackleton identifies himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's taken in to be sort of restored,</v>

88
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:22.711
<v Speaker 1>given water and I guess you could say </v>
<v Speaker 1>debriefed and we're told that one of the</v>

89
00:05:23.711 --> 00:05:28.711
<v Speaker 1>first questions he asks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his benefactor is for an update on </v>

90
00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 1>whatever happened with the war he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>following and he says,</v>

91
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:35.641
<v Speaker 1>tell me when was the war over and in one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the more famous responses you'll ever</v>

92
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:42.871
<v Speaker 1>get about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it says so much in a couple of </v>

93
00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:42.871
<v Speaker 1>sentences and that's why it's gone down </v>
<v Speaker 1>in history.</v>

94
00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:47.611
<v Speaker 1>The benefactor as opposed to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>answered is when was the war over </v>

95
00:05:47.611 --> 00:05:49.420
<v Speaker 1>question with the war isn't over </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions or dead.</v>

96
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Europe is mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world is mad.</v>

97
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>If Shackleton reacts to this news with </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrified,</v>

98
00:05:57.951 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 1>disbelief,</v>

99
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:04.390
<v Speaker 5>then he's just catching up to the rest </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the world because no one can believe </v>

100
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.730
<v Speaker 5>that the level of intensity that this </v>
<v Speaker 5>conflict displays from minute one can be</v>

101
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:12.280
<v Speaker 5>sustained.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember,</v>

102
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 5>this war starts very differently than </v>
<v Speaker 5>the second world war does.</v>

103
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 5>The Second World War kind of ramps up </v>
<v Speaker 5>slowly.</v>

104
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.230
<v Speaker 5>The first world war is like someone </v>
<v Speaker 5>pulling the pin on a grenade and </v>

105
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 5>everything explodes at once.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone attacks at once.</v>

106
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 5>There are a lot more people killed in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the first month of the first world war.</v>

107
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.430
<v Speaker 5>Then the first month of the second,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in fact,</v>

108
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:36.431
<v Speaker 5>so many people are killed that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people living through this period have </v>

109
00:06:36.431 --> 00:06:39.410
<v Speaker 5>nothing to compare this to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The numbers are off the charts.</v>

110
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.950
<v Speaker 5>I mean look at what they were looking at</v>
<v Speaker 5>as normal casualty numbers and by the </v>

111
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:45.960
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is considered to be horrible.</v>

112
00:06:45.961 --> 00:06:47.330
<v Speaker 5>So I mean they.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They thought it could be bad.</v>

113
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.700
<v Speaker 5>It could be like the Russo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Japanese war on steroids could knit.</v>

114
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.040
<v Speaker 5>That war happened the decade before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first world war lasted.</v>

115
00:06:55.041 --> 00:07:00.041
<v Speaker 5>Eighteen months is seen as sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>testing ground for a lot of the weapons </v>

116
00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 5>and tactics and everything that would be</v>
<v Speaker 5>used in the next war.</v>

117
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.050
<v Speaker 5>And in 18 months a hundred and 65,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are killed.</v>

118
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.140
<v Speaker 5>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One hundred and 65,000</v>

119
00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:12.890
<v Speaker 5>people are killed in a week or two when </v>
<v Speaker 5>the first world war breaks out.</v>

120
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.430
<v Speaker 5>Twenty 2000 Frenchmen die in a day in </v>
<v Speaker 5>August,</v>

121
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:21.080
<v Speaker 5>1914.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are no metrics for that for you.</v>

122
00:07:21.081 --> 00:07:26.081
<v Speaker 5>American history fans out there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's the worst war in American </v>

123
00:07:26.081 --> 00:07:26.390
<v Speaker 5>history?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The US civil war,</v>

124
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:29.000
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because everyone who dies is an American</v>

125
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.490
<v Speaker 5>casualty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Last four years,</v>

126
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.460
<v Speaker 5>you lose between 600,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>and 700,000</v>

127
00:07:34.461 --> 00:07:39.461
<v Speaker 5>Americans killed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how many people you lose killed </v>

128
00:07:39.461 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 5>roughly in the first month of the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>world war.</v>

129
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:47.530
<v Speaker 5>Everyone is stunned and it's not just </v>
<v Speaker 5>gender roles and world leaders and </v>

130
00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:48.050
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

131
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:53.050
<v Speaker 5>Let's say that this war can't last.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have some of the top economic minds </v>

132
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:54.020
<v Speaker 5>in the world saying that for economic </v>
<v Speaker 5>reasons,</v>

133
00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 5>it can't continue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>John Maynard Keynes,</v>

134
00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.720
<v Speaker 5>the guy who will later be the father of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Keynesian economics says in 1914 that </v>

135
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.300
<v Speaker 5>the war won't last a year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As soon as the financial liquidity dries</v>

136
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:05.810
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>

137
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 5>all the belligerents will be forced to </v>
<v Speaker 5>come to terms and make peace.</v>

138
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.490
<v Speaker 5>He couldn't have been more wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Countries will ditch the gold standard </v>

139
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 5>almost immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll inflate their currency,</v>

140
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.540
<v Speaker 5>they'll open up lines of credit and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll start borrowing.</v>

141
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.620
<v Speaker 5>It was lord her ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kitchener Britain's war minister,</v>

142
00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:28.180
<v Speaker 5>and one of the few people who understood</v>
<v Speaker 5>how long this war was really going to.</v>

143
00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:29.040
<v Speaker 5>Last said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

144
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.420
<v Speaker 5>no financial pressure has ever stopped a</v>
<v Speaker 5>war in progress and kitchen or </v>

145
00:08:36.171 --> 00:08:40.160
<v Speaker 5>understood what many of these people who</v>
<v Speaker 5>should have understood better didn't,</v>

146
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.520
<v Speaker 5>and that's that we had entered the era </v>
<v Speaker 5>where nation states could really take a </v>

147
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.271
<v Speaker 5>punch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We talked about that in an earlier </v>

148
00:08:49.271 --> 00:08:49.271
<v Speaker 5>episode.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a mixed blessing.</v>

149
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.600
<v Speaker 5>It means that you don't succumb to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>enemy's attacks right away,</v>

150
00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 5>but it means you also last longer and </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you last longer,</v>

151
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:02.300
<v Speaker 5>you see your human and your financial </v>
<v Speaker 5>capital ground into powder.</v>

152
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.120
<v Speaker 5>There are a lot of people who wonder </v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it was actually a benefit for </v>

153
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 5>the French and the British to win the </v>
<v Speaker 5>battle of the Marne.</v>

154
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.780
<v Speaker 5>That's where we left off the last </v>
<v Speaker 5>program.</v>

155
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.180
<v Speaker 5>The Battle of the Marne at the time was </v>
<v Speaker 5>seen as know the savior of France.</v>

156
00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:24.780
<v Speaker 5>The Germans would their prewar battle </v>
<v Speaker 5>plans with they're meticulous precision </v>

157
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.580
<v Speaker 5>planning that had had decades to come up</v>
<v Speaker 5>with perfecting this plan.</v>

158
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.370
<v Speaker 5>They'd failed at the battle of the Marne</v>
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

159
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.620
<v Speaker 5>when by the time you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

160
00:09:32.621 --> 00:09:35.920
<v Speaker 5>the crowning moment happens where </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything rests on what the Germans are</v>

161
00:09:35.921 --> 00:09:40.921
<v Speaker 5>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Both sides are like a couple of punch </v>

162
00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:43.541
<v Speaker 5>drunk prize fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've been using that analogy for this </v>

163
00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:47.161
<v Speaker 5>whole conflict because it worked so well</v>
<v Speaker 5>and up until you know the French and </v>

164
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:52.111
<v Speaker 5>British victory at the Marne.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Germans had been the one really </v>

165
00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:55.741
<v Speaker 5>dishing out the heavy blows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but everyone is so tired and at the end </v>

166
00:09:55.741 --> 00:10:00.210
<v Speaker 5>of their rope,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the time the Maren happens only a </v>

167
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.940
<v Speaker 5>month into the conflict that you get the</v>
<v Speaker 5>feeling like it's the end of the first </v>

168
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.751
<v Speaker 5>round of that both fighters have given </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything they have and they're so </v>

169
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:08.620
<v Speaker 5>tired that if anybody could just land </v>
<v Speaker 5>one solid blow on either side,</v>

170
00:10:08.621 --> 00:10:13.621
<v Speaker 5>it'll be over on the French and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>British land that blow and the Germans </v>

171
00:10:13.781 --> 00:10:16.030
<v Speaker 5>are forced backward.</v>

172
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:22.490
<v Speaker 5>They're forced backward so that they can</v>
<v Speaker 5>reorganize their lines and close up this</v>

173
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:28.820
<v Speaker 5>dangerous hole in their lines that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>exploited by French and British troops,</v>

174
00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:32.430
<v Speaker 5>as Churchill famously said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as only he can.</v>

175
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:37.910
<v Speaker 5>Those troops were probing their way into</v>
<v Speaker 5>the German liver and it's a classic </v>

176
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:43.110
<v Speaker 5>maneuver to try to pull your troops back</v>
<v Speaker 5>and reorganize your lines,</v>

177
00:10:43.111 --> 00:10:48.111
<v Speaker 5>but it's also a dangerous one and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>also means that the Germans have given </v>

178
00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:50.310
<v Speaker 5>up on the so called Schlieffen plan.</v>

179
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:56.710
<v Speaker 5>Can I find it interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes when you read some of the </v>

180
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:59.801
<v Speaker 5>histories of the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you will find yourself in a very similar</v>

181
00:11:00.051 --> 00:11:04.520
<v Speaker 5>situation to the commanders on both </v>
<v Speaker 5>sides of the western.</v>

182
00:11:04.521 --> 00:11:09.521
<v Speaker 5>What will become the western front and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is you will be studying this as </v>

183
00:11:09.921 --> 00:11:13.280
<v Speaker 5>though you're playing around with toy </v>
<v Speaker 5>soldiers.</v>

184
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll read stuff where they'll say,</v>

185
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this division did this and pulled back </v>

186
00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.380
<v Speaker 5>to here and you're totally losing track </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the human element.</v>

187
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:26.590
<v Speaker 5>And the problem with that is if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't understand the condition of the </v>

188
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.891
<v Speaker 5>people on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to create all sorts of </v>

189
00:11:29.891 --> 00:11:32.450
<v Speaker 5>plans that don't take into account what </v>
<v Speaker 5>they can actually carry out.</v>

190
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:33.830
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

191
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.640
<v Speaker 5>the general staffs have all these armies</v>
<v Speaker 5>are tens of miles behind where the </v>

192
00:11:40.281 --> 00:11:41.210
<v Speaker 5>fighting is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

193
00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.790
<v Speaker 5>most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the German general staff for example,</v>

194
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.740
<v Speaker 5>are sitting in wonderful French chateaus</v>
<v Speaker 5>with roaring fire places,</v>

195
00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:53.741
<v Speaker 5>drinking wine out of crystal glasses and</v>
<v Speaker 5>playing with maps and protractors trying</v>

196
00:11:54.491 --> 00:11:56.740
<v Speaker 5>to decide where to move people and what </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do with them.</v>

197
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:02.250
<v Speaker 5>And the British and the French </v>
<v Speaker 5>commanders are often doing the same </v>

198
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.341
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is is that these little </v>

199
00:12:05.341 --> 00:12:08.580
<v Speaker 5>protractors in these armies that they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>moving around on maps bear no </v>

200
00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.470
<v Speaker 5>resemblance to what the human beings on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the ground or dealing with.</v>

201
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.720
<v Speaker 5>The human beings on the ground are </v>
<v Speaker 5>spent.</v>

202
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:19.990
<v Speaker 5>Both sides have warned themselves down </v>
<v Speaker 5>to the nub and can hardly function </v>

203
00:12:21.171 --> 00:12:21.840
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

204
00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:26.860
<v Speaker 5>this is the point in the war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once the Germans start retreating after </v>

205
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.891
<v Speaker 5>the battle of the Marne,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where the British and French commanders </v>

206
00:12:29.891 --> 00:12:30.740
<v Speaker 5>think they've got them on the run,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sir John French,</v>

207
00:12:30.741 --> 00:12:34.250
<v Speaker 5>the British commander thinks that he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be in Berlin in six weeks.</v>

208
00:12:34.251 --> 00:12:39.251
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll unleash the cavalry will launch </v>

209
00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:39.830
<v Speaker 5>this massive pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>will destroy the enemy who's routing and</v>

210
00:12:39.831 --> 00:12:44.831
<v Speaker 5>it'll be all over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is as Sir John French's </v>

211
00:12:44.831 --> 00:12:46.730
<v Speaker 5>troops are in no condition to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

212
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:52.150
<v Speaker 5>every side is finding out another one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the new realities of modern warfare and </v>

213
00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:57.350
<v Speaker 5>that's that they use ammunition at a </v>
<v Speaker 5>pace that nobody was prepared for.</v>

214
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:03.400
<v Speaker 5>At this point in the conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody is actually rationing the </v>

215
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:08.710
<v Speaker 5>artillery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can't even use the guns the way </v>

216
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:08.710
<v Speaker 5>they want to because they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough shells.</v>

217
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:09.950
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take the Russians as a perfect example.</v>

218
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.590
<v Speaker 5>At this point in the war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Russians are producing 35,000</v>

219
00:13:16.591 --> 00:13:19.500
<v Speaker 5>artillery shells a month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sounds great,</v>

220
00:13:19.501 --> 00:13:22.200
<v Speaker 5>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Until you realize that once the fighting</v>

221
00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:25.380
<v Speaker 5>actually starts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're using 45,000</v>

222
00:13:25.381 --> 00:13:27.240
<v Speaker 5>shells a day,</v>

223
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.440
<v Speaker 5>making $35,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>a month,</v>

224
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.320
<v Speaker 5>shooting off 45,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>shells a day.</v>

225
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.920
<v Speaker 5>Now all these armies went into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>conflict with nice reserves of these </v>

226
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.450
<v Speaker 5>shells,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but by a month and a half into it,</v>

227
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:45.350
<v Speaker 5>they are down to almost nothing and even</v>
<v Speaker 5>the French and the British,</v>

228
00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.540
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as they pursued the German armies,</v>

229
00:13:47.541 --> 00:13:49.310
<v Speaker 5>as the German army's retreat from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>modern,</v>

230
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.510
<v Speaker 5>they can't function the way that they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>trained and ready to do so.</v>

231
00:13:53.511 --> 00:13:58.511
<v Speaker 5>They have to ration everything and so </v>
<v Speaker 5>did the Germans and everybody's just at </v>

232
00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:00.650
<v Speaker 5>the end of their rope and you lose the </v>
<v Speaker 5>human element.</v>

233
00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:05.890
<v Speaker 5>When you study the history of things </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the very highest levels in the </v>

234
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:08.891
<v Speaker 5>moving of armies around on maps and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>see arrows and cavalry armies and all </v>

235
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:12.911
<v Speaker 5>these kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When the people on the ground or in a </v>

236
00:14:12.911 --> 00:14:15.401
<v Speaker 5>completely different situation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's how writer Gj Meyer describes the</v>

237
00:14:15.831 --> 00:14:19.160
<v Speaker 5>situation after them on quote the French</v>
<v Speaker 5>and British.</v>

238
00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.390
<v Speaker 5>Though jubilant at and in many cases </v>
<v Speaker 5>astonished by the German withdrawal from</v>

239
00:14:23.391 --> 00:14:26.720
<v Speaker 5>the Marne were badly battered,</v>
<v Speaker 5>worn out,</v>

240
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:31.460
<v Speaker 5>and running low on essential equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Many were almost too exhausted to move.</v>

241
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.120
<v Speaker 5>He's quoting an English soldier now </v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

242
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.850
<v Speaker 5>after five days and nights of fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one English soldier wrote,</v>

243
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.220
<v Speaker 5>decimated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>spent and hungry.</v>

244
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:45.400
<v Speaker 5>We are lying on the bare earth with only</v>
<v Speaker 5>one desire in our hearts to get </v>

245
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.601
<v Speaker 5>ourselves killed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Meyer continues and they were short of </v>

246
00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:53.021
<v Speaker 5>shells for their artillery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is one measure of the intensity of </v>

247
00:14:53.021 --> 00:14:57.041
<v Speaker 5>this new kind of warfare that the French</v>
<v Speaker 5>faced critical shortages of ammunition </v>

248
00:14:57.041 --> 00:15:00.971
<v Speaker 5>for their 75 millimeter canon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're most effective field artillery </v>

249
00:15:00.971 --> 00:15:03.050
<v Speaker 5>piece because only 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>rounds were being produced per day.</v>

250
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.320
<v Speaker 5>That was barely 20 percent of the need.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He continues for any number of such </v>

251
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.220
<v Speaker 5>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The armies of the entente,</v>

252
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:15.340
<v Speaker 5>the allies failed to close with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>retreating Germans or exploit the huge </v>

253
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.090
<v Speaker 5>gap that had prompted their withdrawal.</v>

254
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.460
<v Speaker 5>They did not attack in force until the </v>
<v Speaker 5>German first,</v>

255
00:15:19.461 --> 00:15:24.461
<v Speaker 5>second,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and third armies had settled into </v>

256
00:15:24.461 --> 00:15:24.461
<v Speaker 5>fortified positions on high ground north</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the Ain,</v>

257
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.000
<v Speaker 5>the next east,</v>
<v Speaker 5>West River,</v>

258
00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:30.860
<v Speaker 5>north of the Marne.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By then it was too late and to quote the</v>

259
00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:33.200
<v Speaker 5>Germans themselves were in a horrible </v>
<v Speaker 5>condition.</v>

260
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.740
<v Speaker 5>German soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Julius Koch,</v>

261
00:15:35.741 --> 00:15:38.360
<v Speaker 5>and writes about the retreat from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Marne quote.</v>

262
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.770
<v Speaker 5>The streets were badly worn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>abandoned vehicles.</v>

263
00:15:42.771 --> 00:15:46.100
<v Speaker 5>We're aligned on the sides of the road.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We began to move at 3:00</v>

264
00:15:46.101 --> 00:15:49.250
<v Speaker 5>in the morning and before we were fully </v>
<v Speaker 5>aware of what was happening,</v>

265
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:54.430
<v Speaker 5>we found ourselves with the rear guard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Regiments of infantry shot to pieces </v>

266
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:59.380
<v Speaker 5>arrived in a pitiful condition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had cast away their knapsacks and </v>

267
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.510
<v Speaker 5>all unnecessary impediments and we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to get along as fast as possible.</v>

268
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:06.530
<v Speaker 5>Soon after the first shrapnel of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>enemy began to burst above our heads,</v>

269
00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.560
<v Speaker 5>which caused us to accelerate our march </v>
<v Speaker 5>continually.</v>

270
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.200
<v Speaker 5>The road which had also been used during</v>
<v Speaker 5>the advance,</v>

271
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:17.380
<v Speaker 5>was still marked by deep shell holes </v>
<v Speaker 5>that were filled with water to the very </v>

272
00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.810
<v Speaker 5>edge for it rained without interruption.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was pitch dark and every now and then</v>

273
00:16:20.811 --> 00:16:24.890
<v Speaker 5>someone would fall into one of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>shell holes we were all wet through,</v>

274
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:28.640
<v Speaker 5>but continue to press on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some would stumble over something in the</v>

275
00:16:28.641 --> 00:16:30.590
<v Speaker 5>dark,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but nobody paid any attention.</v>

276
00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:35.860
<v Speaker 5>The great thing was to get along dead </v>
<v Speaker 5>horses and men lay in the middle of the </v>

277
00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.731
<v Speaker 5>road,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but nobody took the trouble to remove </v>

278
00:16:39.731 --> 00:16:41.681
<v Speaker 5>the obstacle into quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lest we forget about the human element.</v>

279
00:16:42.381 --> 00:16:47.381
<v Speaker 5>Remember that these Germans are moving </v>
<v Speaker 5>through country that was formally </v>

280
00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:50.330
<v Speaker 5>occupied by civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where the heck are they?</v>

281
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:55.750
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a lot of cases they're still there </v>

282
00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.660
<v Speaker 5>and in very great danger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's what coach and writes about that </v>

283
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:03.550
<v Speaker 5>quote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The road was covered with the equipment </v>

284
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:03.550
<v Speaker 5>the soldiers had thrown away.</v>

285
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:06.860
<v Speaker 5>We too had long ago cast aside all </v>
<v Speaker 5>unnecessary ballast.</v>

286
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:11.210
<v Speaker 5>Thus we were marching when we passed a </v>
<v Speaker 5>wood densely packed with refugees.</v>

287
00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:16.570
<v Speaker 5>Those hunted people had stretched </v>
<v Speaker 5>blankets between the trees so as to </v>

288
00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:17.750
<v Speaker 5>protect themselves from the rain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are.</v>

289
00:17:17.751 --> 00:17:22.460
<v Speaker 5>They were lying in the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 5>conceivable misery all in the jumble men</v>

290
00:17:22.461 --> 00:17:24.770
<v Speaker 5>and women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>children and gray beards.</v>

291
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:29.540
<v Speaker 5>They're camp reached as far as the road </v>
<v Speaker 5>and one could observe the terrible hours</v>

292
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:33.230
<v Speaker 5>that they'd lived through,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had left deep furrows in their faces.</v>

293
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.780
<v Speaker 5>They looked at us with we're retired </v>
<v Speaker 5>eyes.</v>

294
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:38.000
<v Speaker 5>The children begged us to give them some</v>
<v Speaker 5>bread,</v>

295
00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.770
<v Speaker 5>but we had nothing whatsoever left and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're ourselves tormented by hunger.</v>

296
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:46.820
<v Speaker 5>The enemy's shrapnel was still </v>
<v Speaker 5>accompanying us and we had scarcely left</v>

297
00:17:46.821 --> 00:17:51.821
<v Speaker 5>the wood when shrapnel began to explode,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which caused the refugees now exposed to</v>

298
00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:56.340
<v Speaker 5>the fire to crowd into the fields in an </v>
<v Speaker 5>attempt to reach safety.</v>

299
00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:01.490
<v Speaker 5>Many of them joined us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but before long they were forbidden to </v>

300
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:02.460
<v Speaker 5>use the road because they impeded the </v>
<v Speaker 5>retreat of the troops.</v>

301
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:07.730
<v Speaker 5>Thus all of them were driven without </v>
<v Speaker 5>pity into the fields soaked by the rain </v>

302
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:13.090
<v Speaker 5>end quote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As German soldiers like Julius or Yulia </v>

303
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:18.500
<v Speaker 5>coaching are retreating back the way </v>
<v Speaker 5>they came there being closely pursued by</v>

304
00:18:20.101 --> 00:18:25.101
<v Speaker 5>their French and British fab.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The series one of whom is the Irish </v>

305
00:18:25.101 --> 00:18:28.551
<v Speaker 5>soldier fighting in the British </v>
<v Speaker 5>Expeditionary Force that we've talked </v>

306
00:18:28.551 --> 00:18:28.551
<v Speaker 5>about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>John Lucy,</v>

307
00:18:28.551 --> 00:18:29.360
<v Speaker 5>who writes about this time quote,</v>

308
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:34.540
<v Speaker 5>our advanced continued steadily as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Germans were driven back from the Marne.</v>

309
00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:39.780
<v Speaker 5>Their rear guards showed some resistance</v>
<v Speaker 5>every day and occasionally we picked up </v>

310
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.470
<v Speaker 5>stragglers and wounded from the enemy </v>
<v Speaker 5>army.</v>

311
00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:45.910
<v Speaker 5>Although we took our turn in our brigade</v>
<v Speaker 5>at advanced garden outpost duties.</v>

312
00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:51.150
<v Speaker 5>Our battalion did not really cross </v>
<v Speaker 5>swords with the enemy again until the </v>

313
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.451
<v Speaker 5>14th of September.</v>
<v Speaker 5>On that day and on the few days </v>

314
00:18:54.451 --> 00:18:57.841
<v Speaker 5>proceeding it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rain fell and we were not very </v>

315
00:18:57.841 --> 00:18:58.420
<v Speaker 5>comfortable either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In bivouac are on the line of March.</v>

316
00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.590
<v Speaker 5>The weather began to get cold on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>evening of 13th September,</v>

317
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:07.770
<v Speaker 5>a British airplane,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the few the British army </v>

318
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.591
<v Speaker 5>possessed approached us from the German </v>
<v Speaker 5>side and wheeling around a lighted in a </v>

319
00:19:10.631 --> 00:19:12.760
<v Speaker 5>field to the right of our marching </v>
<v Speaker 5>columns.</v>

320
00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:18.030
<v Speaker 5>The flying officer climb slowly out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>his machine and coming stumbling towards</v>

321
00:19:18.071 --> 00:19:21.130
<v Speaker 5>us in his heavy kit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did Not wait to find an officer,</v>

322
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:25.930
<v Speaker 5>but shouted to us all there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are waiting for you up there.</v>

323
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:30.990
<v Speaker 5>Thousands of them and he waived his </v>
<v Speaker 5>right arm toward the wooded heights </v>

324
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:32.110
<v Speaker 5>across the river ane some three miles </v>
<v Speaker 5>away,</v>

325
00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:37.920
<v Speaker 5>and to quote the river Ain was right by </v>
<v Speaker 5>the highest elevated point in this whole</v>

326
00:19:41.411 --> 00:19:46.411
<v Speaker 5>area of the front.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's not very high in terms of the </v>

327
00:19:46.411 --> 00:19:48.400
<v Speaker 5>grand scheme of geography around the </v>
<v Speaker 5>planet,</v>

328
00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:51.820
<v Speaker 5>but in the very flat Harry in near the </v>
<v Speaker 5>French and Belgian borders,</v>

329
00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:57.450
<v Speaker 5>it was 500 feet tall in some places and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that gave a commanding view of all the </v>

330
00:19:58.121 --> 00:20:03.121
<v Speaker 5>flat country around it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the point that the German </v>

331
00:20:03.121 --> 00:20:06.841
<v Speaker 5>soldiers had been told to turn back </v>
<v Speaker 5>around and face their pursuers and dig </v>

332
00:20:07.721 --> 00:20:09.520
<v Speaker 5>in and stopped them.</v>

333
00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:14.900
<v Speaker 5>This had been one of the last command is</v>
<v Speaker 5>made by the former German commander,</v>

334
00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:17.580
<v Speaker 5>the one whose job it was to carry out </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Schlieffen plan.</v>

335
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:22.850
<v Speaker 5>Helmut von Moltke,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the younger before he totally collapsed </v>

336
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:25.410
<v Speaker 5>from his nervous breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 5>After his plan failed,</v>

337
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:30.980
<v Speaker 5>he's replaced by one of his critics a </v>
<v Speaker 5>controversial choice that the kaiser </v>

338
00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:36.540
<v Speaker 5>tabbed a guy named General Eric from </v>
<v Speaker 5>Falcon.</v>

339
00:20:36.541 --> 00:20:39.540
<v Speaker 5>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

340
00:20:39.541 --> 00:20:44.100
<v Speaker 5>one thing that becomes clear when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at the high commands have all these</v>

341
00:20:44.101 --> 00:20:49.101
<v Speaker 5>armies is the generals have outrageous </v>
<v Speaker 5>most of the time and they often are </v>

342
00:20:50.681 --> 00:20:55.681
<v Speaker 5>jealous and they snipe at their peers </v>
<v Speaker 5>and when Falcon hine is named,</v>

343
00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.780
<v Speaker 5>it angers among other people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eric Luton door,</v>

344
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:03.810
<v Speaker 5>this young wonder kin who's been doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>great things for the Germans on the </v>

345
00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.730
<v Speaker 5>eastern front and who,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who will say a Falcon Heinz appointment,</v>

346
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:12.210
<v Speaker 5>I am only capable of love and hate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I hate General Falcon Heine and </v>

347
00:21:14.761 --> 00:21:19.761
<v Speaker 5>Falcon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Haim was critical of von Moltke before </v>

348
00:21:19.761 --> 00:21:22.500
<v Speaker 5>the battle of the Marne even starts </v>
<v Speaker 5>Falcon High and looks at what von Moltke</v>

349
00:21:22.501 --> 00:21:25.200
<v Speaker 5>is doing and thinks he's lost his mind </v>
<v Speaker 5>and writes.</v>

350
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.030
<v Speaker 5>On September fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>19,</v>

351
00:21:27.031 --> 00:21:32.031
<v Speaker 5>14 quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our general staff has completely lost </v>

352
00:21:32.031 --> 00:21:33.750
<v Speaker 5>its head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sleeping's notes do not help any further</v>

353
00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:37.890
<v Speaker 5>and so his wits come to an end and to </v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

354
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.780
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Kaiser must've read that and decided</v>

355
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:44.750
<v Speaker 5>that since von Moltke couldn't pull this</v>
<v Speaker 5>off,</v>

356
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:49.940
<v Speaker 5>maybe one of his critics can falcon hine</v>
<v Speaker 5>turns his troops around,</v>

357
00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:55.150
<v Speaker 5>tells them to dig in and begins looking </v>
<v Speaker 5>for replacements for the people who've </v>

358
00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.080
<v Speaker 5>died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because the German army is a fraction of</v>

359
00:21:57.081 --> 00:22:00.650
<v Speaker 5>what it was just a couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 5>before and they aren't the only ones.</v>

360
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.350
<v Speaker 5>The British and the French armies have a</v>
<v Speaker 5>similar problem.</v>

361
00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:08.650
<v Speaker 5>They're all decimated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The differences is Britain and France </v>

362
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:12.191
<v Speaker 5>have colonies and dominions and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Commonwealth nations who the minute the </v>

363
00:22:13.071 --> 00:22:17.000
<v Speaker 5>war starts are basically told to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>people over there and there are arriving</v>

364
00:22:17.001 --> 00:22:17.570
<v Speaker 5>every day.</v>

365
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:23.910
<v Speaker 5>The British have Indian troops from </v>
<v Speaker 5>India arrive and Canadian show up very </v>

366
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:27.841
<v Speaker 5>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Scots from Scotland are always a </v>

367
00:22:27.841 --> 00:22:31.621
<v Speaker 5>part of the British forces and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>arrive in kilts and this is where they </v>

368
00:22:31.621 --> 00:22:35.371
<v Speaker 5>will get their famous nickname,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which some people wonder if it even </v>

369
00:22:35.371 --> 00:22:39.061
<v Speaker 5>happened this way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's too good of a nickname to not </v>

370
00:22:39.061 --> 00:22:43.200
<v Speaker 5>mention the German supposedly call them </v>
<v Speaker 5>the ladies from Hell because of the </v>

371
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:48.390
<v Speaker 5>kilts they were and they were all </v>
<v Speaker 5>showing up every day in greater numbers </v>

372
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.590
<v Speaker 5>and taking their place in the line to </v>
<v Speaker 5>replace the dead and the wounded.</v>

373
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.290
<v Speaker 5>The French are bringing troops from </v>
<v Speaker 5>North Africa,</v>

374
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:58.470
<v Speaker 5>from Morocco and Algeria and troops from</v>
<v Speaker 5>central Africa and places like Senegal.</v>

375
00:22:58.781 --> 00:23:02.710
<v Speaker 5>So you have dark skinned black Africans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the French army,</v>

376
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:08.190
<v Speaker 5>something that the Germans one are not </v>
<v Speaker 5>accustomed to and to a little dismayed </v>

377
00:23:08.561 --> 00:23:13.561
<v Speaker 5>about because they think about all of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the black Africans left in Africa that </v>

378
00:23:13.561 --> 00:23:15.730
<v Speaker 5>may be could be brought to fight against</v>
<v Speaker 5>them too.</v>

379
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:19.450
<v Speaker 5>When the Germans tried to reinforce </v>
<v Speaker 5>their own,</v>

380
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:21.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>torn open ranks,</v>

381
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.900
<v Speaker 5>they have to do it with Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now they have a bunch of them people who</v>

382
00:23:25.901 --> 00:23:30.901
<v Speaker 5>the minute the war was declared,</v>
<v Speaker 5>signed up and joined the forces and </v>

383
00:23:30.901 --> 00:23:34.621
<v Speaker 5>we're in training this whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is that the war is only </v>

384
00:23:34.621 --> 00:23:37.681
<v Speaker 5>about six weeks old.</v>
<v Speaker 5>None of these people have had enough </v>

385
00:23:37.681 --> 00:23:40.861
<v Speaker 5>training to make them anywhere near as </v>
<v Speaker 5>good as the soldiers they're trying to </v>

386
00:23:40.861 --> 00:23:41.380
<v Speaker 5>replace but fall could and calls them </v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

387
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.260
<v Speaker 5>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The situation is desperate.</v>

388
00:23:44.261 --> 00:23:48.170
<v Speaker 5>The war could be lost right here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right now and every man is needed</v>

389
00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:54.720
<v Speaker 5>and all these troops are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>thrown into the blood bath up near the </v>

390
00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.681
<v Speaker 5>French and Belgian border.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's at that spot where the Germans had </v>

391
00:23:58.681 --> 00:24:02.671
<v Speaker 5>turned around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>halted the retreat that had been going </v>

392
00:24:02.671 --> 00:24:05.791
<v Speaker 5>on ever since the battle of the Marne </v>
<v Speaker 5>taken the heights on the other side of </v>

393
00:24:05.791 --> 00:24:09.510
<v Speaker 5>the river ane and begun to Deegan </v>
<v Speaker 5>fortify,</v>

394
00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:14.500
<v Speaker 5>reequip reinforce and are waiting for </v>
<v Speaker 5>their pursuers to show up.</v>

395
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:20.190
<v Speaker 5>They're French and British pursuers </v>
<v Speaker 5>assume that they're going after a bunch </v>

396
00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:23.791
<v Speaker 5>of Rowdy Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not expecting to run into </v>

397
00:24:23.791 --> 00:24:23.791
<v Speaker 5>heavily four to five positions in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>very,</v>

398
00:24:23.791 --> 00:24:28.681
<v Speaker 5>very strong spot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember John Lucy and the BDF or </v>

399
00:24:28.681 --> 00:24:32.581
<v Speaker 5>marching toward that area.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When that airplane lands in the field </v>

400
00:24:32.581 --> 00:24:35.521
<v Speaker 5>and the pilot goes running up to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>British march column saying they're </v>

401
00:24:35.521 --> 00:24:38.731
<v Speaker 5>waiting for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thousands of them on the other side of </v>

402
00:24:38.731 --> 00:24:38.740
<v Speaker 5>the river on the night of September </v>
<v Speaker 5>13th,</v>

403
00:24:38.741 --> 00:24:43.741
<v Speaker 5>1914,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the French and the British tried to </v>

404
00:24:43.741 --> 00:24:46.321
<v Speaker 5>cross that river and dislodged the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Germans from the height and it's a </v>

405
00:24:46.321 --> 00:24:46.420
<v Speaker 5>disaster.</v>

406
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:53.240
<v Speaker 5>The British do this crossing at night in</v>
<v Speaker 5>heavy fog on pontoon boats for the most </v>

407
00:24:54.481 --> 00:24:59.481
<v Speaker 5>part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They get to the other side aside that </v>

408
00:24:59.481 --> 00:24:59.490
<v Speaker 5>has no natural cover and that's facing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

409
00:24:59.491 --> 00:25:04.491
<v Speaker 5>four to 500 foot hills in the distance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>heavily wooded and the sun comes up and </v>

410
00:25:05.431 --> 00:25:10.431
<v Speaker 5>burns off the fog,</v>
<v Speaker 5>leaving the British troops totally </v>

411
00:25:10.431 --> 00:25:14.001
<v Speaker 5>exposed and the Germans slaughter them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Artillery machine guns even from the </v>

412
00:25:14.911 --> 00:25:19.911
<v Speaker 5>flank,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the British stagger back across the </v>

413
00:25:19.911 --> 00:25:22.851
<v Speaker 5>river and their commander Sir John </v>
<v Speaker 5>French orders them to dig in and face </v>

414
00:25:22.891 --> 00:25:25.350
<v Speaker 5>the Germans who were dug in on the other</v>
<v Speaker 5>side of the river.</v>

415
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.900
<v Speaker 5>This is the main thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your history books will tell you that </v>

416
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:32.240
<v Speaker 5>the first battle of the ane is known </v>
<v Speaker 5>for.</v>

417
00:25:32.241 --> 00:25:36.320
<v Speaker 5>It's supposedly the time when trench </v>
<v Speaker 5>warfare is initiated.</v>

418
00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:41.150
<v Speaker 5>This will be the most iconic and </v>
<v Speaker 5>memorable part of the first world war,</v>

419
00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:46.960
<v Speaker 5>but it's a misnomer to suggest that </v>
<v Speaker 5>trench warfare just started here because</v>

420
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:52.130
<v Speaker 5>given the technology of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trench warfare begins organically.</v>

421
00:25:52.131 --> 00:25:57.131
<v Speaker 5>It's a natural human response to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fact that the air above ground level is </v>

422
00:25:57.291 --> 00:26:02.291
<v Speaker 5>filled with so much steel and lead that </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's suicide to be out in the open,</v>

423
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:08.350
<v Speaker 5>so across the entire front,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stretching all the way from the Swiss </v>

424
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.810
<v Speaker 5>border across the entire Franco German </v>
<v Speaker 5>border up through Luxembourg,</v>

425
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.840
<v Speaker 5>up into Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 5>More than 400 miles and millions of men </v>

426
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.621
<v Speaker 5>on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Long human beings have done the most </v>

427
00:26:20.621 --> 00:26:24.020
<v Speaker 5>natural thing possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've gone to ground and they've tried</v>

428
00:26:24.021 --> 00:26:27.230
<v Speaker 5>to get as low as possible to escape what</v>
<v Speaker 5>earns gender.</v>

429
00:26:27.231 --> 00:26:30.530
<v Speaker 5>We'll call the storm of steel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Later in the war,</v>

430
00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:36.040
<v Speaker 5>in addition to digging down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they throw up things called breast </v>

431
00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.861
<v Speaker 5>works,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is putting stuff in front of your </v>

432
00:26:38.861 --> 00:26:39.560
<v Speaker 5>position to stop the bullets from </v>
<v Speaker 5>hitting you.</v>

433
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.120
<v Speaker 5>If you're lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's sandbags.</v>

434
00:26:41.121 --> 00:26:43.740
<v Speaker 5>If you're not lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's anything you can get your hands on.</v>

435
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:49.100
<v Speaker 5>The combination of digging in the earth </v>
<v Speaker 5>and putting up barriers in front of you </v>

436
00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.320
<v Speaker 5>begins to fortify the entire line on </v>
<v Speaker 5>both sides and in some spots.</v>

437
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:56.100
<v Speaker 5>The Germans and the French are only a </v>
<v Speaker 5>couple hundred yards from each other.</v>

438
00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:02.370
<v Speaker 5>The fortification of the entire line </v>
<v Speaker 5>changes this war in ways that the </v>

439
00:27:02.741 --> 00:27:05.040
<v Speaker 5>generals on either side are unprepared </v>
<v Speaker 5>for.</v>

440
00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.520
<v Speaker 5>They don't know what to do,</v>

441
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:12.950
<v Speaker 5>so they go back to the training manuals </v>
<v Speaker 5>which say find a flank,</v>

442
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.800
<v Speaker 5>turn the flank attack in the rear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is is that there's only one </v>

443
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.781
<v Speaker 5>tiny little area of this more than 400 </v>
<v Speaker 5>mile line where it hasn't calcified into</v>

444
00:27:24.901 --> 00:27:29.160
<v Speaker 5>a normal siege situation and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 5>area between,</v>

445
00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:34.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this battle at the river and that has </v>

446
00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:34.530
<v Speaker 5>just happened and the ocean to the north</v>
<v Speaker 5>of it.</v>

447
00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:39.650
<v Speaker 5>It's not a very big zone and both the </v>
<v Speaker 5>British and the French on one side and </v>

448
00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:43.911
<v Speaker 5>the Germans on the other begin a crab </v>
<v Speaker 5>like dance of death as one historian </v>

449
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:50.090
<v Speaker 5>described it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to probe their way towards open </v>

450
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:53.781
<v Speaker 5>country for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was known as the race to the sea,</v>

451
00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.080
<v Speaker 5>but historians have come to hate that </v>
<v Speaker 5>term because it gives the false idea </v>

452
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.510
<v Speaker 5>that somehow reaching the c is the goal </v>
<v Speaker 5>of both these sides would.</v>

453
00:28:03.511 --> 00:28:06.150
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if both sides reached the sea,</v>

454
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:11.450
<v Speaker 5>it means that there are no flanks </v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore and there will be several big </v>

455
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:16.311
<v Speaker 5>battles between the army's as they </v>
<v Speaker 5>collide in their attempt to find an open</v>

456
00:28:16.681 --> 00:28:19.840
<v Speaker 5>flank to turn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

457
00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:25.320
<v Speaker 5>it's worth pointing out here that what </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're about to experience is the most </v>

458
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.650
<v Speaker 5>complicated war I've ever studied and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a very unusual conflict because in </v>

459
00:28:30.011 --> 00:28:33.640
<v Speaker 5>many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the battlefield is not going to change.</v>

460
00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.520
<v Speaker 5>This area up near the Franco Belgian </v>
<v Speaker 5>border,</v>

461
00:28:36.521 --> 00:28:41.521
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is going to become one of the worst </v>

462
00:28:41.521 --> 00:28:44.490
<v Speaker 5>killing grounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>extended killing grounds in all human </v>

463
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:44.490
<v Speaker 5>history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and later in the war,</v>

464
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:49.170
<v Speaker 5>troops marching up to this battle ground</v>
<v Speaker 5>will be able to smell it before they </v>

465
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:50.380
<v Speaker 5>actually get there.</v>

466
00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.140
<v Speaker 5>In addition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when one side attacks,</v>

467
00:28:55.141 --> 00:28:57.010
<v Speaker 5>the other side will often counter </v>
<v Speaker 5>attack,</v>

468
00:28:57.011 --> 00:29:00.270
<v Speaker 5>so if you look at the battle on a map,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it makes no sense at all.</v>

469
00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:05.271
<v Speaker 5>I've got 400 page books that deal with </v>
<v Speaker 5>just single encounters between the two </v>

470
00:29:05.271 --> 00:29:09.090
<v Speaker 5>sides and it's impossible to make heads </v>
<v Speaker 5>or tails of it even with maps,</v>

471
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:14.120
<v Speaker 5>even if you're an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And part of the reason why is because </v>

472
00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.001
<v Speaker 5>the nature of battle has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Armies are staying in contact with each </v>

473
00:29:17.001 --> 00:29:21.591
<v Speaker 5>other now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's very different than through </v>

474
00:29:21.591 --> 00:29:21.591
<v Speaker 5>most of human history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Through most of human history.</v>

475
00:29:21.591 --> 00:29:23.190
<v Speaker 5>Armies come together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a short,</v>

476
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:28.250
<v Speaker 5>sharp clash,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then they break contact and move in </v>

477
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:28.250
<v Speaker 5>opposite directions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

478
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:32.100
<v Speaker 5>battles that last more than one day are </v>
<v Speaker 5>extremely rare.</v>

479
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.160
<v Speaker 5>Up until this time period,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of a sudden,</v>

480
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.040
<v Speaker 5>these armies aren't going to break </v>
<v Speaker 5>contact.</v>

481
00:29:38.041 --> 00:29:43.041
<v Speaker 5>They're going to stay on opposite sides </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a short little no man's land and hold</v>

482
00:29:43.301 --> 00:29:48.301
<v Speaker 5>each other by the throat even on so </v>
<v Speaker 5>called quiet parts of the front.</v>

483
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:52.720
<v Speaker 5>Hundreds or thousands of men can be </v>
<v Speaker 5>killed every day.</v>

484
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:58.290
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not unheard of near the end </v>

485
00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:59.800
<v Speaker 5>stages of the US civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ulysses s grant,</v>

486
00:29:59.801 --> 00:30:04.801
<v Speaker 5>the northern general,</v>
<v Speaker 5>will have a similar strategy where he </v>

487
00:30:04.801 --> 00:30:06.370
<v Speaker 5>maintains contact with the enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>grabs them by the throat,</v>

488
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:10.300
<v Speaker 5>doesn't let them go and grind them down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A strategy of attrition,</v>

489
00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:15.780
<v Speaker 5>but that's new to the European </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience and neither side's giving up </v>

490
00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:19.360
<v Speaker 5>yet they're going to try to find that </v>
<v Speaker 5>flank until there is no flank anymore.</v>

491
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.720
<v Speaker 5>That race to the sea will involve </v>
<v Speaker 5>several more big battles including one </v>

492
00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.640
<v Speaker 5>that involves you know what's left of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the poor Belgian army.</v>

493
00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.610
<v Speaker 5>Remember the Belgian army was what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Germans thought.</v>

494
00:30:30.611 --> 00:30:35.611
<v Speaker 5>We're going to be a bunch of chocolate </v>
<v Speaker 5>soldiers and instead they put up this </v>

495
00:30:35.611 --> 00:30:37.200
<v Speaker 5>heroic doomed resistance to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

496
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:39.970
<v Speaker 5>fighting and being pushed backwards </v>
<v Speaker 5>every step of the way.</v>

497
00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:45.210
<v Speaker 5>Once the Germans reform their lines at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the river and their entire flank is </v>

498
00:30:45.851 --> 00:30:48.790
<v Speaker 5>threatened by the parts of Belgium that </v>
<v Speaker 5>haven't fallen to them yet,</v>

499
00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:53.200
<v Speaker 5>including the giant and vital port city </v>
<v Speaker 5>of Antwerp.</v>

500
00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:59.040
<v Speaker 5>So this is when the Germans go take all </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they pound and top with those same </v>

501
00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:03.631
<v Speaker 5>enormous guns that they destroyed the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Belgian forts with at the beginning of </v>

502
00:31:03.631 --> 00:31:04.600
<v Speaker 5>the war and they pushed the Belgian </v>
<v Speaker 5>army.</v>

503
00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:09.601
<v Speaker 5>All the ways too that the Belgians are </v>
<v Speaker 5>sitting there with their backs to the </v>

504
00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:13.021
<v Speaker 5>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is no place left to run and the </v>

505
00:31:13.021 --> 00:31:17.011
<v Speaker 5>Belgian king is with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And at one point he orders his officers </v>

506
00:31:17.011 --> 00:31:20.551
<v Speaker 5>to stand behind the trenches and shoot </v>
<v Speaker 5>any Belgian soldiers that dare run away </v>

507
00:31:20.551 --> 00:31:25.260
<v Speaker 5>and they stay there being pounded by the</v>
<v Speaker 5>artillery until they can't stop the </v>

508
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:30.001
<v Speaker 5>Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They realized that if they don't hold </v>

509
00:31:30.001 --> 00:31:34.021
<v Speaker 5>that area,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Germans are going to be the one who </v>

510
00:31:34.021 --> 00:31:34.021
<v Speaker 5>find that open flank and the turn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the British and the French.</v>

511
00:31:34.021 --> 00:31:34.740
<v Speaker 5>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

512
00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:40.030
<v Speaker 5>the part of the war where it looks like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Germans might actually reverse the </v>

513
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:42.200
<v Speaker 5>entire battle of the Mons results and </v>
<v Speaker 5>when any way.</v>

514
00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:46.380
<v Speaker 5>So the Belgians do something that is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

515
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:51.500
<v Speaker 5>their nuclear option and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a sacrifice that might have saved </v>

516
00:31:51.731 --> 00:31:54.700
<v Speaker 5>the war for the allies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember,</v>

517
00:31:54.701 --> 00:31:57.460
<v Speaker 5>Belgium is one of those areas of Europe </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is actually,</v>

518
00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:00.010
<v Speaker 5>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this part of flanders that we're talking</v>

519
00:32:00.011 --> 00:32:05.011
<v Speaker 5>about in Belgium below sea level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the reason that it even exists is </v>

520
00:32:05.011 --> 00:32:09.571
<v Speaker 5>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>forever the Belgians have been pumping </v>

521
00:32:09.571 --> 00:32:12.421
<v Speaker 5>out water and building dikes and things </v>
<v Speaker 5>like that to keep the ocean out the king</v>

522
00:32:13.061 --> 00:32:18.061
<v Speaker 5>of Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When things become desperate to the </v>

523
00:32:18.061 --> 00:32:20.191
<v Speaker 5>point of doomsday blows up the dykes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Belgian king makes the decision to </v>

524
00:32:21.971 --> 00:32:26.971
<v Speaker 5>let the seawater in on October 22nd,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's a true sacrifice because he's </v>

525
00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.130
<v Speaker 5>not just flooding one of the more </v>
<v Speaker 5>fertile parts of his country.</v>

526
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:35.370
<v Speaker 5>He's flooding it with sea water and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>salt water will do terrible damage to </v>

527
00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:36.460
<v Speaker 5>the fertility of the region.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember,</v>

528
00:32:36.461 --> 00:32:41.461
<v Speaker 5>the Romans supposedly would so salt into</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ground of the territory of their </v>

529
00:32:41.931 --> 00:32:44.780
<v Speaker 5>very worst enemies so that nothing would</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever grow.</v>

530
00:32:44.781 --> 00:32:48.230
<v Speaker 5>There again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Belgians had done this to themselves</v>

531
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:53.500
<v Speaker 5>voluntarily to protect the very end of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the allied line and keep the Germans </v>

532
00:32:54.351 --> 00:32:56.990
<v Speaker 5>from breaking through and perhaps taking</v>
<v Speaker 5>the channel ports,</v>

533
00:32:56.991 --> 00:32:58.340
<v Speaker 5>which would have been a disaster.</v>

534
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:03.550
<v Speaker 5>The Germans have no idea what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 5>as the water level rises,</v>

535
00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.880
<v Speaker 5>but within a couple of days there's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>five mile wide shoulder deep lake </v>

536
00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:14.640
<v Speaker 5>separating them and the Belgian forces </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the Belgians will stay behind that </v>

537
00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.691
<v Speaker 5>lake for years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That essentially shuts off that part of </v>

538
00:33:18.691 --> 00:33:20.920
<v Speaker 5>the front.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The bad news for the other allied forces</v>

539
00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:26.340
<v Speaker 5>is that now that the Germans didn't need</v>
<v Speaker 5>those troops to try to deal with the </v>

540
00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:30.031
<v Speaker 5>Belgians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they turn them around and threw them </v>

541
00:33:30.031 --> 00:33:30.400
<v Speaker 5>into the developing battle at a place </v>
<v Speaker 5>called [inaudible],</v>

542
00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:36.150
<v Speaker 5>which on October,</v>
<v Speaker 5>22nd breaks out big time and eat crap </v>

543
00:33:36.251 --> 00:33:41.251
<v Speaker 5>becomes this point where the true </v>
<v Speaker 5>futility of the wasting of lives is so </v>

544
00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:49.110
<v Speaker 5>aptly demonstrated because of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>war is all about spending lives to </v>

545
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:52.390
<v Speaker 5>achieve a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The tragedy happens when you spend lives</v>

546
00:33:52.391 --> 00:33:57.391
<v Speaker 5>for no good reason and an eat pray.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You begin to see the kinds of tragic </v>

547
00:33:57.581 --> 00:34:02.581
<v Speaker 5>levels that this will reach a large </v>
<v Speaker 5>number of the troops that the Germans </v>

548
00:34:02.681 --> 00:34:03.870
<v Speaker 5>had called up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

549
00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.490
<v Speaker 5>with very little training or young </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

550
00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:12.390
<v Speaker 5>students whose teachers had </v>
<v Speaker 5>indoctrinated them into the idea that </v>

551
00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:16.111
<v Speaker 5>this is what you do when you fight for </v>
<v Speaker 5>Germany and what a great honor it's </v>

552
00:34:16.111 --> 00:34:16.111
<v Speaker 5>going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

553
00:34:16.111 --> 00:34:20.051
<v Speaker 5>when they would all join up together as </v>
<v Speaker 5>students with fraternity badges and all </v>

554
00:34:20.051 --> 00:34:21.430
<v Speaker 5>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And after very little training,</v>

555
00:34:21.431 --> 00:34:26.431
<v Speaker 5>they were thrown into this combat that </v>
<v Speaker 5>was developing around the city of Ipa </v>

556
00:34:26.431 --> 00:34:27.190
<v Speaker 5>and the surrounding area</v>

557
00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.940
<v Speaker 5>in one of the really tragic parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>conflict,</v>

558
00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:38.720
<v Speaker 5>the students would run up against what </v>
<v Speaker 5>was left of some of the greatest </v>

559
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:43.371
<v Speaker 5>military units in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what was left of the old British </v>

560
00:34:43.371 --> 00:34:46.140
<v Speaker 5>professional army,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which had been ground down.</v>

561
00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:47.850
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever since the war started,</v>

562
00:34:47.851 --> 00:34:50.520
<v Speaker 5>but still had some of its best units </v>
<v Speaker 5>intact.</v>

563
00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:56.690
<v Speaker 5>These badly trained 16,</v>
<v Speaker 5>17 and 18 year old kids</v>

564
00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:06.340
<v Speaker 5>would be massacred for no good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As author Winston Groom writes,</v>

565
00:35:06.961 --> 00:35:11.961
<v Speaker 5>quote on a front of nearly 20 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tens of thousands of men came to grips </v>

566
00:35:13.051 --> 00:35:15.510
<v Speaker 5>and did their best to murder each other </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the cold,</v>

567
00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.240
<v Speaker 5>Dank,</v>
<v Speaker 5>misty hill surrounding April.</v>

568
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:23.630
<v Speaker 5>In many places,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fighting was hand to hand that </v>

569
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:27.050
<v Speaker 5>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>divisions of the German Fourth Army </v>

570
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:28.200
<v Speaker 5>consisting in large part of students </v>
<v Speaker 5>attack the British line,</v>

571
00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:31.620
<v Speaker 5>such as it was in a fit of Wagnerian </v>
<v Speaker 5>frenzy.</v>

572
00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:36.660
<v Speaker 5>The German students came on arm in arm </v>
<v Speaker 5>or waving their rifles in the air,</v>

573
00:35:36.661 --> 00:35:41.661
<v Speaker 5>singing and with their spiked pickle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How the helmets festooned with flowers </v>

574
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:46.050
<v Speaker 5>by the thousands they were shot down </v>
<v Speaker 5>even though they outnumbered the British</v>

575
00:35:46.051 --> 00:35:51.051
<v Speaker 5>at times six to one that morning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They faced the most professional and </v>

576
00:35:51.051 --> 00:35:53.880
<v Speaker 5>elite regiments of the British Army,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if not the world,</v>

577
00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:57.030
<v Speaker 5>the Black Watch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>coldstream guards',</v>

578
00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.930
<v Speaker 5>Scots Guards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cameron's Grenadier Guards,</v>

579
00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:03.210
<v Speaker 5>Irish Guards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stafford's,</v>

580
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.740
<v Speaker 5>Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>highlanders,</v>

581
00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:06.000
<v Speaker 5>green,</v>
<v Speaker 5>howards,</v>

582
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.020
<v Speaker 5>royal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scots,</v>

583
00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.640
<v Speaker 5>fusiliers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Welsh,</v>

584
00:36:08.641 --> 00:36:13.641
<v Speaker 5>fusiliers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and others almost too numerous to </v>

585
00:36:13.641 --> 00:36:13.641
<v Speaker 5>mention,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including the [inaudible] and dragons of</v>

586
00:36:13.641 --> 00:36:18.501
<v Speaker 5>the Cavalry Corps when it was all over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The British official history estimated </v>

587
00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:21.270
<v Speaker 5>that at least half of these youthful </v>
<v Speaker 5>teutonic warriors,</v>

588
00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.330
<v Speaker 5>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>of them had been shot down.</v>

589
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:29.900
<v Speaker 5>The Germans named the battle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the massacre of the innocence and quote </v>

590
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.960
<v Speaker 5>in German it was the kinder Morgan and </v>
<v Speaker 5>after the war,</v>

591
00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:39.560
<v Speaker 5>the parents of some of these children </v>
<v Speaker 5>would put a poignant monument over </v>

592
00:36:39.571 --> 00:36:44.571
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mass grave showing a weeping father and </v>

593
00:36:44.571 --> 00:36:48.081
<v Speaker 5>mother looking out over the mass graves </v>
<v Speaker 5>festooned with the fraternity pins of </v>

594
00:36:50.101 --> 00:36:55.101
<v Speaker 5>these young kids who thought war was </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be a romantic,</v>

595
00:36:55.321 --> 00:36:56.550
<v Speaker 5>heroic adventure.</v>

596
00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:03.230
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to focus on battle after </v>
<v Speaker 5>battle after battle of pointless </v>

597
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:08.211
<v Speaker 5>conflict in this story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a complicated and detailed enough </v>

598
00:37:09.601 --> 00:37:14.601
<v Speaker 5>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you kind of have to pick your </v>

599
00:37:14.601 --> 00:37:14.601
<v Speaker 5>battles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you'll pardon the pun,</v>

600
00:37:14.601 --> 00:37:19.330
<v Speaker 5>and it's the human side of this affair </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I want to focus on what the people </v>

601
00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:21.870
<v Speaker 5>who were living through it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're forced to experience.</v>

602
00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:28.060
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 year old Herbert Solves Bach,</v>

603
00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:33.600
<v Speaker 5>a gunner who had joined up as the war </v>
<v Speaker 5>starts and it was getting his first </v>

604
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.190
<v Speaker 5>taste of battle as the battle of eep or </v>
<v Speaker 5>begins and he writes,</v>

605
00:37:36.191 --> 00:37:38.650
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>change of position.</v>

606
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:43.950
<v Speaker 5>We pull forward,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get our first glimpse of this </v>

607
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:45.400
<v Speaker 5>battlefield and have to get used to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrible scenes and impressions,</v>

608
00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.140
<v Speaker 5>corpses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>corpses,</v>

609
00:37:47.141 --> 00:37:52.141
<v Speaker 5>and more corpses rubble and the remains </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a captured village trenches hastily,</v>

610
00:37:52.271 --> 00:37:53.230
<v Speaker 5>Doug,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the British,</v>

611
00:37:53.231 --> 00:37:58.231
<v Speaker 5>are full of bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We get driven out of this position by </v>

612
00:37:58.231 --> 00:38:00.550
<v Speaker 5>infantry and artillery fire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We stand beside the guns with the horses</v>

613
00:38:00.551 --> 00:38:05.551
<v Speaker 5>and a dreadful night comes down on us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've seen too many horrible things all </v>

614
00:38:05.551 --> 00:38:09.961
<v Speaker 5>at once.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They make a very strong impression on </v>

615
00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:09.970
<v Speaker 5>us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Barely 20 years old as we are,</v>

616
00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:14.680
<v Speaker 5>but these things also hardened us up for</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's going to come and to quote,</v>

617
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:21.920
<v Speaker 5>he's not the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The German writes to his sweetheart with</v>

618
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:28.580
<v Speaker 5>care for her sensibilities and an </v>
<v Speaker 5>understanding of what military </v>

619
00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:32.421
<v Speaker 5>censorship might do to his letter about </v>
<v Speaker 5>what the reality of what he's </v>

620
00:38:32.421 --> 00:38:36.321
<v Speaker 5>experiencing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he writes during these battles in </v>

621
00:38:36.321 --> 00:38:38.440
<v Speaker 5>Flanders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote my dear Maria,</v>

622
00:38:38.930 --> 00:38:41.380
<v Speaker 5>I feel so terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd really rather not write to you.</v>

623
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:43.390
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't mean I've forgotten you </v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

624
00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:48.590
<v Speaker 5>Every day spent here makes it clearer to</v>
<v Speaker 5>me how beautiful home is and what a </v>

625
00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:51.070
<v Speaker 5>crowd of feelings that word home brings </v>
<v Speaker 5>out in me.</v>

626
00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:55.090
<v Speaker 5>I've lived through such horror recently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No words can describe it.</v>

627
00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:00.360
<v Speaker 5>The tragedy all around me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every day the fighting gets fiercer and </v>

628
00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.710
<v Speaker 5>there is no end in sight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Our blood is flowing in torrance.</v>

629
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.120
<v Speaker 5>When I think of our 247th regiment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my ice swim with tears.</v>

630
00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 5>The first and second battalions have </v>
<v Speaker 5>only 250 to 300 men left.</v>

631
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:16.560
<v Speaker 5>So more than half are gone today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Only a few of my comrades will be still </v>

632
00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.860
<v Speaker 5>standing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My company commander,</v>

633
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:23.100
<v Speaker 5>Lieutenant Moss Power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had been at the front for one hour when </v>

634
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:23.890
<v Speaker 5>he was shot through the head Pale and </v>
<v Speaker 5>close to death.</v>

635
00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.010
<v Speaker 5>He was carried past me today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sunday,</v>

636
00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.800
<v Speaker 5>I stood at this modest grave and joined </v>
<v Speaker 5>in prayer.</v>

637
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.640
<v Speaker 5>That's how it is all around me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The most gruesome devastation.</v>

638
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:37.210
<v Speaker 5>Dead and wounded soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dead and dying animals,</v>

639
00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:39.190
<v Speaker 5>horse cadavers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>burned out,</v>

640
00:39:39.191 --> 00:39:40.990
<v Speaker 5>houses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dug up fields,</v>

641
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.700
<v Speaker 5>cars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>clothes,</v>

642
00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:45.670
<v Speaker 5>weaponry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of this is scattered around me.</v>

643
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:48.910
<v Speaker 5>A real mess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't think war would be like this.</v>

644
00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:54.210
<v Speaker 5>We can't sleep for all the noise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At least 30 shells exploded once the </v>

645
00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:58.681
<v Speaker 5>whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We called for backup yesterday and </v>

646
00:39:58.681 --> 00:39:58.681
<v Speaker 5>today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hope they make it.</v>

647
00:39:58.681 --> 00:40:00.730
<v Speaker 5>There are only a few of us left to </v>
<v Speaker 5>tackle the English.</v>

648
00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:04.030
<v Speaker 5>I managed to wash myself properly </v>
<v Speaker 5>yesterday for a change.</v>

649
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:07.630
<v Speaker 5>My beard is getting ever longer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise I'm feeling fine.</v>

650
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:10.900
<v Speaker 5>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all this noise is not going to ruffle my</v>

651
00:40:10.901 --> 00:40:15.901
<v Speaker 5>Wurtenburg calm and cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's from a German soldier named Paul </v>

652
00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:22.100
<v Speaker 5>Hub.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This war brings out the extremes of </v>

653
00:40:23.241 --> 00:40:28.241
<v Speaker 5>humanity and even the most monstrous </v>
<v Speaker 5>human beings that you can pick out </v>

654
00:40:28.851 --> 00:40:33.851
<v Speaker 5>throughout history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exhibit some of that humanity through </v>

655
00:40:33.851 --> 00:40:35.750
<v Speaker 5>their writing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you go read one of the most monstrous</v>

656
00:40:35.751 --> 00:40:39.830
<v Speaker 5>human beings who's ever lived,</v>
<v Speaker 5>chronicles of this combat,</v>

657
00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:44.680
<v Speaker 5>even he seemed somewhat human by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole thing out off hit,</v>

658
00:40:44.681 --> 00:40:49.370
<v Speaker 5>but it was there in flanders in 1914 at </v>
<v Speaker 5>these battles.</v>

659
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:53.570
<v Speaker 5>It was his first encounter with combat </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he wrote about it in his book,</v>

660
00:40:53.571 --> 00:40:55.310
<v Speaker 5>mine comp and said quote</v>

661
00:40:56.540 --> 00:41:01.540
<v Speaker 5>at last.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The day came when we left Munich to </v>

662
00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.710
<v Speaker 5>begin the fulfillment of our duty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For the first time I saw the Rhine as we</v>

663
00:41:03.711 --> 00:41:06.500
<v Speaker 5>rode westward along.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's quiet waters to defend it.</v>

664
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:10.700
<v Speaker 5>The German stream of streams from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>greed of the old enemy.</v>

665
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.460
<v Speaker 5>When through the tender veil of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>early morning mist,</v>

666
00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:17.690
<v Speaker 5>the neater vault monument gleamed down </v>
<v Speaker 5>upon us in the gentle rays of the sun.</v>

667
00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:23.020
<v Speaker 5>The old watch on the Rhine roared out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the endless transport train into the </v>

668
00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:27.161
<v Speaker 5>morning sky,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I felt as though my heart would </v>

669
00:41:27.161 --> 00:41:29.710
<v Speaker 5>burst and then came a damp cold night in</v>
<v Speaker 5>flanders through which we marched in </v>

670
00:41:29.751 --> 00:41:32.870
<v Speaker 5>silence and when the day began to emerge</v>
<v Speaker 5>from the mist,</v>

671
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:35.990
<v Speaker 5>suddenly an iron greeting came whizzing </v>
<v Speaker 5>at us,</v>

672
00:41:35.991 --> 00:41:40.991
<v Speaker 5>over our heads and with the sharp report</v>
<v Speaker 5>sent the little pellets flying between </v>

673
00:41:40.991 --> 00:41:43.040
<v Speaker 5>our ranks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ripping up the wet ground,</v>

674
00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:46.880
<v Speaker 5>but even before the little clouded </v>
<v Speaker 5>passed from 200 throats,</v>

675
00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:50.420
<v Speaker 5>the first hurrah rose to meet the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>messengers of death.</v>

676
00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:52.820
<v Speaker 5>Then a crackling and a roaring and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>singing.</v>

677
00:41:52.821 --> 00:41:55.490
<v Speaker 5>In a howling began and with feverish </v>
<v Speaker 5>eyes.</v>

678
00:41:55.520 --> 00:42:00.520
<v Speaker 5>Each one of us was drawn forward faster </v>
<v Speaker 5>and faster until suddenly passed turnip </v>

679
00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.860
<v Speaker 5>fields and hedges.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The fight began the fight of man against</v>

680
00:42:03.861 --> 00:42:08.861
<v Speaker 5>man and from the distance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the strains of a song reached our ears </v>

681
00:42:08.861 --> 00:42:13.630
<v Speaker 5>coming closer and closer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>leaping from company to company just as </v>

682
00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:14.660
<v Speaker 5>death plunged a busy hand into our </v>
<v Speaker 5>ranks.</v>

683
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.600
<v Speaker 5>The song reached us too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we passed it along.</v>

684
00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.010
<v Speaker 5>Deutschland,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Deutschland,</v>

685
00:42:19.011 --> 00:42:19.860
<v Speaker 5>Uber,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uber,</v>

686
00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:22.370
<v Speaker 5>lesson develop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Four days later,</v>

687
00:42:22.371 --> 00:42:25.100
<v Speaker 5>we came back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even our staff had changed.</v>

688
00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.040
<v Speaker 5>Seventeen year old boys now looked like </v>
<v Speaker 5>men.</v>

689
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:32.480
<v Speaker 5>The volunteers of the list regiment may </v>
<v Speaker 5>not have learned to fight properly,</v>

690
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:36.110
<v Speaker 5>but they knew how to die like soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was the beginning.</v>

691
00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:39.590
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thus it went on year after year,</v>

692
00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:42.590
<v Speaker 5>but the romance of battle had been </v>
<v Speaker 5>replaced by horror.</v>

693
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.860
<v Speaker 5>The enthusiasm gradually cooled and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>exuberant joy was stifled by mortal </v>

694
00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:48.110
<v Speaker 5>fear.</v>

695
00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:53.860
<v Speaker 5>The time came when every man had to </v>
<v Speaker 5>struggle between the instinct of self </v>

696
00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.310
<v Speaker 5>preservation and the admonitions of </v>
<v Speaker 5>duty.</v>

697
00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:58.490
<v Speaker 5>I too was not spared by the struggle </v>
<v Speaker 5>always.</v>

698
00:42:58.491 --> 00:43:01.970
<v Speaker 5>When death was on the hunt of vague,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something tried to revolt,</v>

699
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:05.540
<v Speaker 5>strove to represent itself to the weak </v>
<v Speaker 5>body is reason.</v>

700
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:09.440
<v Speaker 5>Yet it was only cowardice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which in such disguises tries to ensnare</v>

701
00:43:09.441 --> 00:43:12.980
<v Speaker 5>the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a grave tugging and warning set in,</v>

702
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:17.270
<v Speaker 5>and often it was only the last remnant </v>
<v Speaker 5>of conscience which decided the issue.</v>

703
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:20.240
<v Speaker 5>Yet the more this voice admonished one </v>
<v Speaker 5>to caution,</v>

704
00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:22.610
<v Speaker 5>the louder and more insistent it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>lures.</v>

705
00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.340
<v Speaker 5>The sharper resistance grew until at </v>
<v Speaker 5>last.</v>

706
00:43:25.341 --> 00:43:30.341
<v Speaker 5>After a long inner struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>consciousness of duty emerged </v>

707
00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:30.341
<v Speaker 5>victorious.</v>

708
00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.290
<v Speaker 5>By the winter of Nineteen 15,</v>
<v Speaker 5>1916,</v>

709
00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:35.600
<v Speaker 5>he writes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this struggle had been for me,</v>

710
00:43:35.601 --> 00:43:39.200
<v Speaker 5>decided at last.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My will was undisputed master,</v>

711
00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:42.800
<v Speaker 5>if in the first day is I wonder over the</v>
<v Speaker 5>top with rejoicing and laughter,</v>

712
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.040
<v Speaker 5>I was now column and determined and this</v>
<v Speaker 5>was enduring.</v>

713
00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:51.280
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fate could bring on the ultimate tests </v>

714
00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:51.280
<v Speaker 5>without my nerves shattering or my </v>
<v Speaker 5>reason failing.</v>

715
00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:56.590
<v Speaker 5>The young volunteer had become an old </v>
<v Speaker 5>soldier and this transformation had </v>

716
00:43:56.590 --> 00:44:00.581
<v Speaker 5>occurred in the whole army.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It had issued hard and old from the </v>

717
00:44:00.581 --> 00:44:03.761
<v Speaker 5>eternal battles and for those who could </v>
<v Speaker 5>not stand up under the storm while they </v>

718
00:44:03.761 --> 00:44:07.901
<v Speaker 5>were broken and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hitler would actually leap out into no </v>

719
00:44:10.531 --> 00:44:15.531
<v Speaker 5>man's land under a hail of bullets and </v>
<v Speaker 5>try to rescue a commanding officer by </v>

720
00:44:17.011 --> 00:44:20.730
<v Speaker 5>putting them on his back and carrying </v>
<v Speaker 5>him back to the German lines.</v>

721
00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.360
<v Speaker 5>It will be decorated by the Kaiser for </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

722
00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.700
<v Speaker 5>even though the man he rescued died,</v>

723
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:31.680
<v Speaker 5>what Hitler is talking about in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>struggle,</v>

724
00:44:31.681 --> 00:44:36.681
<v Speaker 5>but he has to go through to try to make </v>
<v Speaker 5>himself do something that the entire </v>

725
00:44:36.681 --> 00:44:39.900
<v Speaker 5>urges of humanity inside a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

726
00:44:39.901 --> 00:44:44.901
<v Speaker 5>argue against is something that every </v>
<v Speaker 5>soldier in the war who's going to face </v>

727
00:44:44.901 --> 00:44:46.430
<v Speaker 5>this kind of carnage needs to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

728
00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:51.460
<v Speaker 5>deal with at one point or another,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes they don't even have control </v>

729
00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:55.461
<v Speaker 5>over what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People will be affected by the storm of </v>

730
00:44:55.861 --> 00:45:00.861
<v Speaker 5>steel is Ernst Junger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll call it later in the war in </v>

731
00:45:00.861 --> 00:45:01.200
<v Speaker 5>different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes consciously,</v>

732
00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:05.160
<v Speaker 5>but sometimes in a way that defies even </v>
<v Speaker 5>what they want to do.</v>

733
00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.650
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that the human side of</v>

734
00:45:07.651 --> 00:45:12.651
<v Speaker 5>the first World War requires us to look </v>
<v Speaker 5>at is how and why are these people doing</v>

735
00:45:13.381 --> 00:45:17.430
<v Speaker 5>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Intelligent human beings from the modern</v>

736
00:45:17.431 --> 00:45:22.431
<v Speaker 5>era.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at what our grandfathers and great </v>

737
00:45:22.431 --> 00:45:23.670
<v Speaker 5>grandfathers did in this conflict and </v>
<v Speaker 5>can understand how and why they did it.</v>

738
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:30.680
<v Speaker 5>Part of it is the romance and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>heroism and the idea of duty and what's </v>

739
00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:34.101
<v Speaker 5>expected of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and some of that is what motivates </v>

740
00:45:34.101 --> 00:45:36.891
<v Speaker 5>soldiers to continue to press forward in</v>
<v Speaker 5>unbelievable situations in combat even </v>

741
00:45:37.321 --> 00:45:41.370
<v Speaker 5>today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there were other elements in play,</v>

742
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:47.150
<v Speaker 5>less savory elements.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were dealing with modern nation </v>

743
00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:49.530
<v Speaker 5>states who had ways of compelling a </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain level of behavior.</v>

744
00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:54.980
<v Speaker 5>There were a lot of people who were not </v>
<v Speaker 5>brave in this combat on all sides or </v>

745
00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:58.290
<v Speaker 5>whose bodies simply would not do with </v>
<v Speaker 5>their mind and told them to do.</v>

746
00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:03.840
<v Speaker 5>Those people often had to be sacrificed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As an example to others.</v>

747
00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:10.130
<v Speaker 5>In 1914,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a British brigadier general name e l </v>

748
00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:14.441
<v Speaker 5>spears wrote about one of those methods </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the modern state and really states </v>

749
00:46:14.551 --> 00:46:19.551
<v Speaker 5>had for some time before this use to </v>
<v Speaker 5>compel their troops to be brave and to </v>

750
00:46:19.551 --> 00:46:24.441
<v Speaker 5>do their duty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he wrote quote generally my day had </v>

751
00:46:24.781 --> 00:46:29.781
<v Speaker 5>just been roused from sleep on the straw</v>
<v Speaker 5>or the shed and was standing in the </v>

752
00:46:29.781 --> 00:46:33.771
<v Speaker 5>street when a little group of </v>
<v Speaker 5>unmistakable proport came around the </v>

753
00:46:33.771 --> 00:46:35.460
<v Speaker 5>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>12 soldiers and an NCO,</v>

754
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:40.790
<v Speaker 5>a firing party.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A couple of gendarmes in between them </v>

755
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:44.181
<v Speaker 5>and unarmed soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My heart sank and a feeling of horror </v>

756
00:46:44.181 --> 00:46:47.841
<v Speaker 5>overcame me and execution was about to </v>
<v Speaker 5>take place generally my day took a look </v>

757
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:53.030
<v Speaker 5>and then held up his hand so that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>party halted and with a characteristic </v>

758
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:56.850
<v Speaker 5>quickstep went up to the doomed man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He asked what he had been condemned for.</v>

759
00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:58.650
<v Speaker 5>It was for abandoning his post.</v>

760
00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:01.860
<v Speaker 5>The general then began to talk to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

761
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.750
<v Speaker 5>Quite simply,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he explained,</v>

762
00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:08.780
<v Speaker 5>disciplined to him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>abandoning your post was letting down </v>

763
00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:11.961
<v Speaker 5>your pals more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was letting down your country that </v>

764
00:47:11.961 --> 00:47:14.640
<v Speaker 5>look to you to defend her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He spoke of the necessity of example,</v>

765
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.310
<v Speaker 5>how some could do their duty without </v>
<v Speaker 5>prompting,</v>

766
00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:22.610
<v Speaker 5>but others less strong had to know and </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand the supreme cost of failure.</v>

767
00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:26.550
<v Speaker 5>He told the condemned man that his crime</v>
<v Speaker 5>was not Venal,</v>

768
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:31.670
<v Speaker 5>not low,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then he must die as an so that </v>

769
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:32.560
<v Speaker 5>others should not fail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Surprisingly,</v>

770
00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:37.780
<v Speaker 5>the rich agreed nodding his head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The burden of infamy was lifted from his</v>

771
00:47:37.781 --> 00:47:41.680
<v Speaker 5>shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He saw a glimmer of something redemption</v>

772
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:43.900
<v Speaker 5>in his own eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a real hope,</v>

773
00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:49.140
<v Speaker 5>though he knew he was going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the general went on carrying the man </v>

774
00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:53.971
<v Speaker 5>with him to comprehension that any </v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrifice was worthwhile if it helped </v>

775
00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:54.490
<v Speaker 5>France ever so little.</v>

776
00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.710
<v Speaker 5>What did anything mad or if he knew </v>
<v Speaker 5>this?</v>

777
00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.320
<v Speaker 5>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the general held out his hand,</v>

778
00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:01.780
<v Speaker 5>meaning to shake the condemned person's </v>
<v Speaker 5>hand.</v>

779
00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:07.140
<v Speaker 5>Yours is also a way of dying for France.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She said the procession started again,</v>

780
00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:12.600
<v Speaker 5>but now the victim was a willing one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The sound of a volley in the distance </v>

781
00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:16.600
<v Speaker 5>announced that all was over general demo</v>
<v Speaker 5>day wiped the beads of perspiration from</v>

782
00:48:16.601 --> 00:48:20.980
<v Speaker 5>his brow and for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>perhaps his hands trembled as he lit his</v>

783
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:25.981
<v Speaker 5>pipe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's something that all sides will</v>

784
00:48:26.231 --> 00:48:29.170
<v Speaker 5>do in this war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a way of saying that yes,</v>

785
00:48:29.171 --> 00:48:33.820
<v Speaker 5>you may face certain death if you walk </v>
<v Speaker 5>into the storm that is modern combat,</v>

786
00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:36.670
<v Speaker 5>but you'll also face certain death if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't.</v>

787
00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:43.510
<v Speaker 5>It's very important though to bear in </v>
<v Speaker 5>mind that the fact that these soldiers </v>

788
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:47.510
<v Speaker 5>who failed in their duty somehow are </v>
<v Speaker 5>exposed to capital punishment,</v>

789
00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.450
<v Speaker 5>does not mean that that's why soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 5>fought.</v>

790
00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:56.350
<v Speaker 5>That's something that has been present </v>
<v Speaker 5>in most armies throughout history since </v>

791
00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:57.000
<v Speaker 5>ancient times.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Heck,</v>

792
00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:59.090
<v Speaker 5>the Romans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if your unit fought badly,</v>

793
00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:04.480
<v Speaker 5>would make the men draw lots and one out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of every 10 soldiers in the unit would </v>

794
00:49:04.941 --> 00:49:06.980
<v Speaker 5>be killed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was called decimation,</v>

795
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:12.790
<v Speaker 5>and to add insult to injury,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Romans would make their comrades </v>

796
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:14.180
<v Speaker 5>killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's a standard part of warfare.</v>

797
00:49:14.181 --> 00:49:17.840
<v Speaker 5>Throughout most of history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most of these soldiers were fighting for</v>

798
00:49:17.841 --> 00:49:22.841
<v Speaker 5>much higher values.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Things that to the more cynical 21st </v>

799
00:49:22.881 --> 00:49:26.570
<v Speaker 5>century mind sometimes almost sounded </v>
<v Speaker 5>like you know,</v>

800
00:49:26.571 --> 00:49:29.360
<v Speaker 5>military recruiting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>marketing slogans,</v>

801
00:49:29.361 --> 00:49:34.361
<v Speaker 5>but they meant something to these people</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they mean something to soldiers </v>

802
00:49:34.361 --> 00:49:35.420
<v Speaker 5>today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>duty,</v>

803
00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.000
<v Speaker 5>honor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>country,</v>

804
00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:42.230
<v Speaker 5>sovereign God,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what's more,</v>

805
00:49:42.231 --> 00:49:47.231
<v Speaker 5>once the soldiers get into combat a </v>
<v Speaker 5>responsibility to your comrades.</v>

806
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:54.480
<v Speaker 5>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first world war is able to take one </v>

807
00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:58.681
<v Speaker 5>of the most extreme activities humans </v>
<v Speaker 5>ever take part in warfare and make it </v>

808
00:49:59.711 --> 00:50:03.020
<v Speaker 5>worse and start,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

809
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:08.290
<v Speaker 5>with what trench warfare means for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>soldiers on the ground in terms of day </v>

810
00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:10.430
<v Speaker 5>to day living.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go out in your backyard,</v>

811
00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:16.210
<v Speaker 5>dig yourself a hole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sit down in it in the rain and just live</v>

812
00:50:17.251 --> 00:50:21.860
<v Speaker 5>in a day after day without any bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>guns,</v>

813
00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:26.000
<v Speaker 5>bullets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or murderous combat and it's horrible.</v>

814
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:28.790
<v Speaker 5>That's what these face,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most of them in Flanders,</v>

815
00:50:28.791 --> 00:50:32.240
<v Speaker 5>one of the rainiest parts of Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they live in the mud</v>

816
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:38.510
<v Speaker 5>and they can't quite get their mind </v>
<v Speaker 5>around how that changes this whole </v>

817
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:43.010
<v Speaker 5>romantic idea of adventurous combat that</v>
<v Speaker 5>so many of them signed up for.</v>

818
00:50:43.171 --> 00:50:48.171
<v Speaker 5>Take for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of the most elite units in Francis </v>

819
00:50:48.171 --> 00:50:51.860
<v Speaker 5>military men who were in the French </v>
<v Speaker 5>Foreign Legion and he will find </v>

820
00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:53.070
<v Speaker 5>themselves in holes in the ground.</v>

821
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:59.530
<v Speaker 5>Alan Seeger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who will die on the western front in </v>

822
00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:02.030
<v Speaker 5>1916.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rights as this trench warfare is getting</v>

823
00:51:02.031 --> 00:51:03.440
<v Speaker 5>started.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Quote,</v>

824
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:08.980
<v Speaker 5>this style of trench warfare is </v>
<v Speaker 5>extremely modern and for the artillery </v>

825
00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:12.020
<v Speaker 5>men is doubtless very interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for the poor common soldier,</v>

826
00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:16.280
<v Speaker 5>it is anything but romantic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His role is to simply dig himself a hole</v>

827
00:51:16.281 --> 00:51:19.790
<v Speaker 5>in the ground and keep hidden in it as </v>
<v Speaker 5>tightly as possible,</v>

828
00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:22.970
<v Speaker 5>continually under the fire of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>opposing batteries.</v>

829
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:28.150
<v Speaker 5>He is yet never allowed to get a glimpse</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the enemy exposed to all the dangers </v>

830
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:31.130
<v Speaker 5>of war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but none of it's enthusiasms or splendid</v>

831
00:51:31.131 --> 00:51:36.131
<v Speaker 5>Elon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He is condemned to sit like an animal </v>

832
00:51:36.131 --> 00:51:38.891
<v Speaker 5>limits burrow and hear the shells </v>
<v Speaker 5>whistle over his head and take their </v>

833
00:51:38.891 --> 00:51:41.750
<v Speaker 5>little daily toll from his comrades.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His feet are numb,</v>

834
00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:45.230
<v Speaker 5>his canteen frozen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's not allowed to make a fire.</v>

835
00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:47.360
<v Speaker 5>He's not even permitted to light a </v>
<v Speaker 5>candle.</v>

836
00:51:47.570 --> 00:51:50.540
<v Speaker 5>He must fold himself up in his blanket </v>
<v Speaker 5>and lie down,</v>

837
00:51:50.541 --> 00:51:53.750
<v Speaker 5>cramped in the dirty straw to sleep as </v>
<v Speaker 5>best as he may.</v>

838
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:57.410
<v Speaker 5>How different from the popular notion of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the evening campfire,</v>

839
00:51:57.590 --> 00:52:00.910
<v Speaker 5>the songs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the good cheer and quote.</v>

840
00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:07.700
<v Speaker 5>It's after the battles up in flanders on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ane and an IPA or this trench </v>

841
00:52:08.071 --> 00:52:13.071
<v Speaker 5>warfare sets in the German soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rudolph binder tries to explain what's </v>

842
00:52:13.071 --> 00:52:14.460
<v Speaker 5>happening in 1914 when he writes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

843
00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:18.840
<v Speaker 5>the war has got stuck into a gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 5>siege on both sides.</v>

844
00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:22.230
<v Speaker 5>The whole front is one endless fortified</v>
<v Speaker 5>trench.</v>

845
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:25.530
<v Speaker 5>Neither side has the forced to make a </v>
<v Speaker 5>decisive push.</v>

846
00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:28.680
<v Speaker 5>Everyone seems settled on a winter </v>
<v Speaker 5>campaign,</v>

847
00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:33.830
<v Speaker 5>but as far as I can judge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is no possibility of an early </v>

848
00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:36.861
<v Speaker 5>finish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are still stuck here for perfectly </v>

849
00:52:36.861 --> 00:52:39.651
<v Speaker 5>good reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One might as well say for perfectly bad </v>

850
00:52:39.651 --> 00:52:40.770
<v Speaker 5>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This business may last for a long time.</v>

851
00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:42.120
<v Speaker 5>End Quote.</v>

852
00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:48.740
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's important to remember that most of </v>

853
00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:52.011
<v Speaker 5>the people who are finding themselves </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuck in this business in 1914 aren't </v>

854
00:52:52.231 --> 00:52:57.231
<v Speaker 5>really soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Soldiers might be expected to deal with </v>

855
00:52:57.231 --> 00:53:01.251
<v Speaker 5>this kind of incredible experience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but most of the troops in these uniforms</v>

856
00:53:01.771 --> 00:53:06.771
<v Speaker 5>and carrying weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which you know for all intents and </v>

857
00:53:06.771 --> 00:53:09.411
<v Speaker 5>purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>appeared to be soldiers six or eight </v>

858
00:53:09.411 --> 00:53:12.231
<v Speaker 5>weeks ago were civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were shopkeepers and delivery boys </v>

859
00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:17.510
<v Speaker 5>and students and insurance salesmen and </v>
<v Speaker 5>teachers who all of a sudden find </v>

860
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:22.101
<v Speaker 5>themselves in circumstances that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>just can't make sense of horrible </v>

861
00:53:22.831 --> 00:53:27.831
<v Speaker 5>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Many of these people had never seen a </v>

862
00:53:27.831 --> 00:53:31.911
<v Speaker 5>dead body in their lives and then all of</v>
<v Speaker 5>a sudden find themselves in situations </v>

863
00:53:32.101 --> 00:53:37.101
<v Speaker 5>like this German soldier in 1914 </v>
<v Speaker 5>describing this new phenomenon of trench</v>

864
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:42.470
<v Speaker 5>life day to day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>living in a hole in the ground with </v>

865
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:43.650
<v Speaker 5>combat going on all around you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he writes,</v>

866
00:53:43.651 --> 00:53:48.651
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the dangers of trench life may be </v>

867
00:53:48.651 --> 00:53:51.531
<v Speaker 5>realized when I say that often neither </v>
<v Speaker 5>the dead nor wounded can be removed.</v>

868
00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:55.230
<v Speaker 5>If you put up as much as a little finger</v>
<v Speaker 5>above the edge of the trench,</v>

869
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.840
<v Speaker 5>the bullets come whizzing around </v>
<v Speaker 5>immediately.</v>

870
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.860
<v Speaker 5>The dead bodies must therefore be </v>
<v Speaker 5>allowed to remain in the trench.</v>

871
00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:07.040
<v Speaker 5>That is to say the dead man has got rid </v>
<v Speaker 5>of by digging a grave for him in the </v>

872
00:54:07.261 --> 00:54:12.261
<v Speaker 5>floor of the trench.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A few days ago a soldier was so badly </v>

873
00:54:12.261 --> 00:54:14.760
<v Speaker 5>hit by a shell that he was cut into his </v>
<v Speaker 5>shattered body,</v>

874
00:54:14.761 --> 00:54:19.761
<v Speaker 5>could not be removed without risk to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>survivors and was therefore allowed to </v>

875
00:54:19.761 --> 00:54:22.260
<v Speaker 5>remain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but presently he gave rise to a horrible</v>

876
00:54:22.261 --> 00:54:27.261
<v Speaker 5>stench and whatever they did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the men could not get away from the </v>

877
00:54:27.261 --> 00:54:30.471
<v Speaker 5>mutilated blackened features.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes arms and legs torn away from </v>

878
00:54:30.471 --> 00:54:35.031
<v Speaker 5>the body are allowed to lie about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bottom of the trench until someone can </v>

879
00:54:35.031 --> 00:54:37.390
<v Speaker 5>bury them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One gets hardened in time and to quote,</v>

880
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:44.150
<v Speaker 5>getting hardened in time is what's </v>
<v Speaker 5>happening during this period.</v>

881
00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:49.340
<v Speaker 5>In 1914,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once the fighting of these major first </v>

882
00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:53.091
<v Speaker 5>battles died down because this is when </v>
<v Speaker 5>the reinforcements arrived and the </v>

883
00:54:53.091 --> 00:54:54.780
<v Speaker 5>reinforcements are not part of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>regular army.</v>

884
00:54:54.781 --> 00:54:57.720
<v Speaker 5>These are the civilians from a short </v>
<v Speaker 5>time ago,</v>

885
00:54:57.990 --> 00:55:01.590
<v Speaker 5>thrown into uniform and sent into this </v>
<v Speaker 5>hell of combat.</v>

886
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:03.960
<v Speaker 5>It's a little bit different for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>veterans,</v>

887
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:08.610
<v Speaker 5>especially the professionals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the British professional army,</v>

888
00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:11.160
<v Speaker 5>you know that existed before the war </v>
<v Speaker 5>started.</v>

889
00:55:11.161 --> 00:55:13.860
<v Speaker 5>The so called old contemptible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Our being,</v>

890
00:55:13.861 --> 00:55:17.580
<v Speaker 5>as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>widdled down to practically nothing,</v>

891
00:55:17.581 --> 00:55:20.670
<v Speaker 5>but there's a few of them left and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to integrate these former</v>

892
00:55:20.671 --> 00:55:25.671
<v Speaker 5>civilians into their ranks without </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting killed in the process because </v>

893
00:55:25.671 --> 00:55:29.721
<v Speaker 5>those people don't know the ropes yet </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're doing things that scare the </v>

894
00:55:29.721 --> 00:55:30.750
<v Speaker 5>regulars.</v>
<v Speaker 5>John Lucy,</v>

895
00:55:30.751 --> 00:55:34.950
<v Speaker 5>one of the old contemptible in the Irish</v>
<v Speaker 5>Guards in the BDF writes,</v>

896
00:55:34.951 --> 00:55:39.951
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we stood to in the wet shell holes and </v>

897
00:55:39.951 --> 00:55:43.551
<v Speaker 5>crumbling trenches under the thunder and</v>
<v Speaker 5>blasting flashes of German high </v>

898
00:55:43.551 --> 00:55:43.551
<v Speaker 5>explosives.</v>

899
00:55:43.551 --> 00:55:48.320
<v Speaker 5>There is no need to describe this </v>
<v Speaker 5>bombardment except to say that it was </v>

900
00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:51.861
<v Speaker 5>the worst of my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A few of our fellows broke under it and </v>

901
00:55:51.861 --> 00:55:55.320
<v Speaker 5>one poor chap entirely lost his head and</v>
<v Speaker 5>ran back out of his trench.</v>

902
00:55:55.530 --> 00:55:59.910
<v Speaker 5>He had not a chance in the open.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The earth was vomiting all around us and</v>

903
00:55:59.911 --> 00:56:03.750
<v Speaker 5>he tumbled over in a few yards better to</v>
<v Speaker 5>have kept to the trench.</v>

904
00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:07.110
<v Speaker 5>No trained soldier would leave that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A corporal,</v>

905
00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:10.950
<v Speaker 5>a burly fellow fell near me where the </v>
<v Speaker 5>shrapnel bullet in his head,</v>

906
00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:16.100
<v Speaker 5>he lay unconscious all the day nodding </v>
<v Speaker 5>his hold head as if suffering only from </v>

907
00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:19.650
<v Speaker 5>some slight irritation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And did not become still until evening.</v>

908
00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:24.950
<v Speaker 5>Earlier in the day one youngster said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what about putting him out of his </v>

909
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:28.921
<v Speaker 5>misery?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A more experienced man explained that </v>

910
00:56:28.921 --> 00:56:31.681
<v Speaker 5>there was no pain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The smallest stirrings and little mons </v>

911
00:56:31.681 --> 00:56:32.860
<v Speaker 5>came from a man who was then already as </v>
<v Speaker 5>good as dead.</v>

912
00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:37.180
<v Speaker 5>Another soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lucy says,</v>

913
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:41.710
<v Speaker 5>had his belly ripped open and sat </v>
<v Speaker 5>supporting his back against a trench.</v>

914
00:56:41.711 --> 00:56:46.060
<v Speaker 5>While he gazed with fascinated eyes at </v>
<v Speaker 5>large coils of his own guts,</v>

915
00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:49.950
<v Speaker 5>which he held in both hands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was almost the gasoline aside.</v>

916
00:56:50.050 --> 00:56:55.050
<v Speaker 5>I saw it's sequel was better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The man's entrails had not been </v>

917
00:56:55.050 --> 00:56:56.530
<v Speaker 5>penetrated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He got safe out of the trench,</v>

918
00:56:56.710 --> 00:56:58.420
<v Speaker 5>was washed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tucked in,</v>

919
00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:03.540
<v Speaker 5>and mended well in hospital maimed men </v>
<v Speaker 5>past crouching and crawling behind me,</v>

920
00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:08.760
<v Speaker 5>leaving trails of blood on the ground on</v>
<v Speaker 5>their way to a ditch witch lead back </v>

921
00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:11.770
<v Speaker 5>into the woods behind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of them were moaning to loud.</v>

922
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:14.740
<v Speaker 5>Unlike our old men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he means the veterans.</v>

923
00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:20.130
<v Speaker 5>One young militia man in particular came</v>
<v Speaker 5>by roaring and seeking sympathy for a </v>

924
00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:21.850
<v Speaker 5>broken arm from everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He met.</v>

925
00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:25.360
<v Speaker 5>A lance corporal told him that for God's</v>
<v Speaker 5>sake to put a sock in it,</v>

926
00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:27.370
<v Speaker 5>and then if he were really badly </v>
<v Speaker 5>wounded,</v>

927
00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:31.090
<v Speaker 5>he would have no breath left to howl </v>
<v Speaker 5>that stopped his hysterics.</v>

928
00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:36.420
<v Speaker 5>I should say that the non coms of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>old army had the worst time of all </v>

929
00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:40.360
<v Speaker 5>trying in circumstances like these to </v>
<v Speaker 5>keep inexperienced men in hand.</v>

930
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:45.630
<v Speaker 5>Some of these men could not even fire a </v>
<v Speaker 5>rifle properly and at times our hearts </v>

931
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:48.970
<v Speaker 5>quailed for our safety and theirs and </v>
<v Speaker 5>quote</v>

932
00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:55.160
<v Speaker 5>this experience was so unlike with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>soldiers of the day.</v>

933
00:57:55.161 --> 00:58:00.161
<v Speaker 5>We're accustomed to that minister of war</v>
<v Speaker 5>and war hero himself,</v>

934
00:58:00.681 --> 00:58:04.250
<v Speaker 5>Lord her ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kitchener and Britain famously said,</v>

935
00:58:04.251 --> 00:58:06.260
<v Speaker 5>when seeing what this whole deal was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

936
00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:10.610
<v Speaker 5>this is not war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

937
00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:16.720
<v Speaker 5>maybe it hadn't been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this was sort of a way of telling </v>

938
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:20.300
<v Speaker 5>everyone in this generation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>welcome to the 20th century.</v>

939
00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:22.880
<v Speaker 5>This is how it's going to be for awhile.</v>

940
00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:30.590
<v Speaker 5>These battles in flanders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like dre shatter many of the leaders </v>

941
00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:34.350
<v Speaker 5>confidence in what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember when the war starts,</v>

942
00:58:34.351 --> 00:58:38.280
<v Speaker 5>they have a plan for winning the war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's been worked out over years,</v>

943
00:58:38.281 --> 00:58:41.940
<v Speaker 5>but once that fails,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these generals have to improvise.</v>

944
00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:47.360
<v Speaker 5>They have to create new offensive and </v>
<v Speaker 5>new ways to win the war from where </v>

945
00:58:47.401 --> 00:58:52.401
<v Speaker 5>things stand and after these battles in </v>
<v Speaker 5>flanders die down and you have this </v>

946
00:58:52.401 --> 00:58:56.871
<v Speaker 5>trench warfare setting in general,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Vulcan Vulcan Hine in Germany runs the </v>

947
00:58:56.871 --> 00:58:59.900
<v Speaker 5>numbers and they're horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the battle at Ipa,</v>

948
00:59:00.630 --> 00:59:05.040
<v Speaker 5>all sides combined.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about another 250,000</v>

949
00:59:05.041 --> 00:59:10.041
<v Speaker 5>casualties in a few weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That brings the German totals on the </v>

950
00:59:10.041 --> 00:59:10.200
<v Speaker 5>western front.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Since the war started,</v>

951
00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:15.530
<v Speaker 5>which is August to more than 750,000.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The French are topping a million.</v>

952
00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:19.440
<v Speaker 5>The British had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for all intents and purposes,</v>

953
00:59:19.441 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 5>lost their army,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the greatest</v>

954
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.170
<v Speaker 1>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small but the greatest in the world.</v>

955
00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:28.640
<v Speaker 1>It's down to dozens of many new units </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had hundreds of men,</v>

956
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:34.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very short time ago and in Britain </v>

957
00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:35.030
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to scrape up replacements</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can see how,</v>

958
00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:38.390
<v Speaker 1>how bad it is by how quickly they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing the requirements.</v>

959
00:59:38.391 --> 00:59:43.391
<v Speaker 1>Because when the war starts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be five foot eight inches </v>

960
00:59:43.391 --> 00:59:44.060
<v Speaker 1>tall to be in the British army in </v>
<v Speaker 1>October.</v>

961
00:59:44.061 --> 00:59:47.270
<v Speaker 1>They lower that to five foot five inches</v>
<v Speaker 1>tall,</v>

962
00:59:47.570 --> 00:59:52.570
<v Speaker 1>a single month later in November,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lower that to five foot three </v>

963
00:59:52.570 --> 00:59:55.661
<v Speaker 1>inches tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Germans are having a similar </v>

964
00:59:55.661 --> 00:59:57.230
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They learned a very hard lesson in these</v>

965
00:59:57.231 --> 01:00:02.231
<v Speaker 1>battles in flanders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You must let the troops finished their </v>

966
01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:06.281
<v Speaker 1>training because they threw away a ton </v>
<v Speaker 1>of lives with people who weren't ready </v>

967
01:00:06.281 --> 01:00:08.470
<v Speaker 1>to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fall.</v>

968
01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Heinz got a more difficult situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the British and the French,</v>

969
01:00:12.031 --> 01:00:14.220
<v Speaker 1>as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have dominions and Commonwealth nations.</v>

970
01:00:14.221 --> 01:00:19.221
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Canadians alone in a fit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriotism are sending more than 30,000</v>

971
01:00:20.071 --> 01:00:25.071
<v Speaker 1>fresh troops across the Atlantic in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>largest transportation of troops,</v>

972
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:31.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the history of the world across the </v>

973
01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>large oceans on Falcon high and has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>account for this and he can't.</v>

974
01:00:32.850 --> 01:00:37.850
<v Speaker 1>He goes and he tells the civilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership that the war in the west </v>

975
01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:37.850
<v Speaker 1>can't be worn anymore.</v>

976
01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:44.200
<v Speaker 1>He tells them that they have to come to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of an arrangement and he </v>

977
01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.340
<v Speaker 1>suggests making peace with somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the Russians,</v>

978
01:00:46.341 --> 01:00:48.050
<v Speaker 1>because if you make peace with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians,</v>

979
01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:53.200
<v Speaker 1>maybe the French will lose heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says all of these other nations are </v>

980
01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.440
<v Speaker 1>simply weapons in the hands of the arch </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy,</v>

981
01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:59.680
<v Speaker 1>which is England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they have to be that the </v>

982
01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.441
<v Speaker 1>British have to be the ones that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans focused on and we have to get </v>

983
01:01:02.441 --> 01:01:06.071
<v Speaker 1>these other countries which are merely </v>
<v Speaker 1>swords in the hand of perfidious albion </v>

984
01:01:06.071 --> 01:01:08.240
<v Speaker 1>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to get them out of the war.</v>

985
01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be very hard to do </v>

986
01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:15.941
<v Speaker 1>because way back in September,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the allies sign these agreements </v>

987
01:01:15.941 --> 01:01:19.391
<v Speaker 1>saying nobody will make a separate peace</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonetheless high and hopes that he can </v>

988
01:01:19.391 --> 01:01:20.990
<v Speaker 1>make his war aims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

989
01:01:20.991 --> 01:01:23.960
<v Speaker 1>no longer victory but shattering some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these powers.</v>

990
01:01:23.961 --> 01:01:27.080
<v Speaker 1>So they leave the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The civilian leadership in Germany,</v>

991
01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:32.140
<v Speaker 1>the politicians like Beckman whole veg </v>
<v Speaker 1>are appalled by what Falcon High and </v>

992
01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:36.180
<v Speaker 1>tells them they can't figure out a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do this because the German,</v>

993
01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>just like all these other countries are </v>
<v Speaker 1>so appalled by the casualties and the </v>

994
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:44.261
<v Speaker 1>blood that's been spilled that nobody is</v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to give up anything.</v>

995
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:49.630
<v Speaker 1>You've already lost too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing if you lose all those </v>

996
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:52.991
<v Speaker 1>people in a victory to another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you lose all those people in a loss </v>

997
01:01:52.991 --> 01:01:57.430
<v Speaker 1>besides Beth holding just a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>months ago was writing up plans for what</v>

998
01:01:57.711 --> 01:02:00.950
<v Speaker 1>the victory conditions in the war are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be and he's got these grandiose</v>

999
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:03.380
<v Speaker 1>schemes where we're going to push the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians back.</v>

1000
01:02:03.381 --> 01:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>We're going to keep the French down </v>
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>

1001
01:02:05.301 --> 01:02:08.480
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have all these vassal </v>
<v Speaker 1>states and now his chief military leader</v>

1002
01:02:08.481 --> 01:02:09.050
<v Speaker 1>is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1003
01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:09.920
<v Speaker 1>we can't win the war</v>

1004
01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.360
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fun Fall.</v>

1005
01:02:13.361 --> 01:02:18.361
<v Speaker 1>Get Heinz rivals guys like Luton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>door from the east who already hate him </v>

1006
01:02:18.361 --> 01:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>this early say that his attitude,</v>

1007
01:02:20.090 --> 01:02:25.090
<v Speaker 5>you know this early in the war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is tantamount to treason and basically </v>

1008
01:02:25.090 --> 01:02:28.941
<v Speaker 5>insinuating in no uncertain terms that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>change in military leadership might </v>

1009
01:02:28.941 --> 01:02:32.631
<v Speaker 5>change all these sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When on Falcon Highness told that </v>

1010
01:02:32.631 --> 01:02:34.230
<v Speaker 5>there's no way that we're ending the </v>
<v Speaker 5>war.</v>

1011
01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:38.460
<v Speaker 5>He tells his troops on the western front</v>
<v Speaker 5>to hold onto what you have.</v>

1012
01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:41.460
<v Speaker 5>Never surrender a square foot of what </v>
<v Speaker 5>you've won.</v>

1013
01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:46.610
<v Speaker 5>If you do counterattack immediately and </v>
<v Speaker 5>retake it because they've taken valuable</v>

1014
01:02:46.981 --> 01:02:48.660
<v Speaker 5>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>valuable farmland,</v>

1015
01:02:48.661 --> 01:02:53.661
<v Speaker 5>valuable resources,</v>
<v Speaker 5>valuable industrial land from the </v>

1016
01:02:53.661 --> 01:02:55.320
<v Speaker 5>French,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if he can't get the war stopped from</v>

1017
01:02:55.321 --> 01:02:57.870
<v Speaker 5>the political leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's going to hold onto what he has.</v>

1018
01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:03.080
<v Speaker 5>He tells the troops on the west to </v>
<v Speaker 5>deepen their fortifications instead of </v>

1019
01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:05.940
<v Speaker 5>just one line of trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wants multiple lines of trenches.</v>

1020
01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:11.090
<v Speaker 5>He and all the other leaders on both </v>
<v Speaker 5>sides begin to use this wonderful weapon</v>

1021
01:03:11.131 --> 01:03:14.070
<v Speaker 5>which doesn't seem like a weapon at all </v>
<v Speaker 5>of barbed wire.</v>

1022
01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:18.510
<v Speaker 5>Something that was first invented a </v>
<v Speaker 5>generation before to keep cattle pending</v>

1023
01:03:18.511 --> 01:03:23.511
<v Speaker 5>in the American west.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in the last couple of wars since </v>

1024
01:03:23.511 --> 01:03:26.631
<v Speaker 5>then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had been used sparingly and sort of </v>

1025
01:03:26.631 --> 01:03:29.271
<v Speaker 5>experimentally now all sides take this </v>
<v Speaker 5>wire with all these sharp edges and </v>

1026
01:03:29.311 --> 01:03:34.311
<v Speaker 5>begin to use it as a fortification.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This will be another one of these iconic</v>

1027
01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:40.521
<v Speaker 5>things on the western front and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't even think that something like </v>

1028
01:03:40.521 --> 01:03:41.760
<v Speaker 5>wire with little teeny barbs on it will </v>
<v Speaker 5>make that much of a difference,</v>

1029
01:03:41.761 --> 01:03:46.761
<v Speaker 5>but it proves to be one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>important elements of the of the war on </v>

1030
01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:52.491
<v Speaker 5>the western front.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can even make a case that they will </v>

1031
01:03:52.491 --> 01:03:54.510
<v Speaker 5>invent weapon systems which still </v>
<v Speaker 5>dominate militaries today,</v>

1032
01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:59.070
<v Speaker 5>simply to overcome the barrier created </v>
<v Speaker 5>by things like barbed wire.</v>

1033
01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:05.570
<v Speaker 5>Now it's not all bad news for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>central powers in Germany is 1914 wines </v>

1034
01:04:05.941 --> 01:04:10.941
<v Speaker 5>down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sure General [inaudible] high and has </v>

1035
01:04:10.941 --> 01:04:11.820
<v Speaker 5>decided that he can't see a way to </v>
<v Speaker 5>victory on the western front,</v>

1036
01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:16.140
<v Speaker 5>but there's fighting going on on other </v>
<v Speaker 5>fronts to his main ad.</v>

1037
01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:17.820
<v Speaker 5>This areas in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Germany's high command,</v>

1038
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:23.300
<v Speaker 5>the ever more powerful team of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hindenburg and Ludendorff are believers </v>

1039
01:04:24.811 --> 01:04:26.970
<v Speaker 5>that you can win the war by beating the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Russians.</v>

1040
01:04:26.971 --> 01:04:31.971
<v Speaker 5>They will become part of the group of </v>
<v Speaker 5>German generals that will be known as </v>

1041
01:04:31.971 --> 01:04:33.960
<v Speaker 5>easterners,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that think you can win the war by</v>

1042
01:04:33.961 --> 01:04:36.120
<v Speaker 5>being victorious in the East Falcon </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hines,</v>

1043
01:04:36.121 --> 01:04:40.230
<v Speaker 5>one of these guys who you know as part </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the cabal known as the Westerners,</v>

1044
01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:43.980
<v Speaker 5>believers that any real victory in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>war will come on the western front,</v>

1045
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:47.100
<v Speaker 5>but there are new fronts opening up his </v>
<v Speaker 5>19,</v>

1046
01:04:47.101 --> 01:04:51.120
<v Speaker 5>14 winds down strange fronts to first of</v>
<v Speaker 5>all,</v>

1047
01:04:51.121 --> 01:04:54.690
<v Speaker 5>we haven't even mentioned that there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting going on in the Pacific because</v>

1048
01:04:54.691 --> 01:04:58.260
<v Speaker 5>it really is a sidebar to this story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Japan,</v>

1049
01:04:58.261 --> 01:05:00.450
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once the war breaks out quickly,</v>

1050
01:05:00.451 --> 01:05:04.410
<v Speaker 5>throws in their lot with Britain and </v>
<v Speaker 5>France and Russia and the allies,</v>

1051
01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:07.620
<v Speaker 5>they do so for purely opportunistic </v>
<v Speaker 5>reasons.</v>

1052
01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:12.720
<v Speaker 5>The Germans have some territories in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pacific that Japan can easily snap up.</v>

1053
01:05:12.721 --> 01:05:14.880
<v Speaker 5>It won't be much fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It won't be much trouble,</v>

1054
01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:19.510
<v Speaker 5>and if the allies somehow lose the war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's not much.</v>

1055
01:05:19.511 --> 01:05:24.511
<v Speaker 5>Germany and Austria,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hungary and stuff can do to Japan way </v>

1056
01:05:24.511 --> 01:05:27.160
<v Speaker 5>over in the Pacific anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no downside to the Japanese snap</v>

1057
01:05:27.161 --> 01:05:32.161
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of these German island possessions </v>

1058
01:05:32.161 --> 01:05:33.871
<v Speaker 5>in the Pacific that takes some German </v>
<v Speaker 5>territories on the Asian mainland and </v>

1059
01:05:33.871 --> 01:05:38.611
<v Speaker 5>the most important part of all of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>actions will be the fact that some of </v>

1060
01:05:38.611 --> 01:05:43.411
<v Speaker 5>those places will be battle grounds in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Second World War and also that </v>

1061
01:05:43.421 --> 01:05:48.421
<v Speaker 5>Japan's taking of German possessions on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Asian mainland help precipitate </v>

1062
01:05:48.421 --> 01:05:53.251
<v Speaker 5>later war between Japan and China,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which will help create the conditions </v>

1063
01:05:53.251 --> 01:05:54.550
<v Speaker 5>where the Japanese are part of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Pacific War and the Second World War.</v>

1064
01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:56.800
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's more of a long term </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation.</v>

1065
01:05:57.430 --> 01:06:00.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's more of a longterm cancerous</v>
<v Speaker 5>situation,</v>

1066
01:06:00.551 --> 01:06:03.010
<v Speaker 5>but Japan's been in the war since the </v>
<v Speaker 5>beginning.</v>

1067
01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:05.260
<v Speaker 5>It's part of what makes this a world </v>
<v Speaker 5>war.</v>

1068
01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.300
<v Speaker 5>But in November 19,</v>
<v Speaker 5>14,</v>

1069
01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:10.930
<v Speaker 5>Turkey enters the war and this is a very</v>
<v Speaker 5>different situation.</v>

1070
01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:16.080
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Turks are not united on the idea at </v>

1071
01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:16.690
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of the more aggressive,</v>

1072
01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:22.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>members of the government who are now </v>

1073
01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:24.451
<v Speaker 5>called the young Turks sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>precipitated in a way that leaves the </v>

1074
01:06:24.451 --> 01:06:25.600
<v Speaker 5>rest of the government out of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>decision.</v>

1075
01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:30.870
<v Speaker 5>They in some Germans working together </v>
<v Speaker 5>decide to shell some Russian port </v>

1076
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:35.281
<v Speaker 5>facilities and the Black Sea without </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting the rest of the government's </v>

1077
01:06:35.281 --> 01:06:38.851
<v Speaker 5>position,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then of course Russia declares war </v>

1078
01:06:38.851 --> 01:06:38.851
<v Speaker 5>on Turkey and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're in,</v>

1079
01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:42.100
<v Speaker 5>but the Germans had been trying to set </v>
<v Speaker 5>this up for a long time.</v>

1080
01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:47.580
<v Speaker 5>They wanted Turkey on their side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is strange because Turkey is one </v>

1081
01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:52.141
<v Speaker 5>of those powers that's really having a </v>
<v Speaker 5>hard time right now and the Germans </v>

1082
01:06:52.141 --> 01:06:52.660
<v Speaker 5>already have one of those.</v>

1083
01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.300
<v Speaker 5>They're allied to Austria,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hungary,</v>

1084
01:06:55.690 --> 01:06:59.290
<v Speaker 5>which you know in four or five months of</v>
<v Speaker 5>war already looks done.</v>

1085
01:06:59.590 --> 01:07:04.590
<v Speaker 5>The Germans will take to saying about </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're Austrian allies that they are </v>

1086
01:07:04.590 --> 01:07:07.420
<v Speaker 5>fettered to a corpse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well now they're adding another corpse.</v>

1087
01:07:07.421 --> 01:07:12.421
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you really have to admire how well </v>

1088
01:07:12.421 --> 01:07:14.311
<v Speaker 5>Germany does in this war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>considering that they have to have the </v>

1089
01:07:14.311 --> 01:07:17.491
<v Speaker 5>weakest powers in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not just on their side but requiring a </v>

1090
01:07:17.491 --> 01:07:21.841
<v Speaker 5>lot of their help,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the Turks provide an interesting use</v>

1091
01:07:22.690 --> 01:07:25.540
<v Speaker 5>to the Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not that they have an army and navy</v>

1092
01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:30.541
<v Speaker 5>that's going to be real helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the Turks control a nice chunk of </v>

1093
01:07:30.541 --> 01:07:35.521
<v Speaker 5>what today we would call the Middle East</v>
<v Speaker 5>and by simply deciding to get into the </v>

1094
01:07:35.521 --> 01:07:39.811
<v Speaker 5>war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they forced the British and the French </v>

1095
01:07:39.811 --> 01:07:40.660
<v Speaker 5>who have a lot of possessions in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>area to defend them.</v>

1096
01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:46.110
<v Speaker 5>They've expanded the battlefield to </v>
<v Speaker 5>include a whole bunch of areas that </v>

1097
01:07:46.391 --> 01:07:48.220
<v Speaker 5>nobody was fighting over before.</v>

1098
01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:52.570
<v Speaker 5>Turkey got into the war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's more turkeys?</v>

1099
01:07:52.571 --> 01:07:57.571
<v Speaker 5>Historic enemy is Russia a Russia that </v>
<v Speaker 5>is putting all their manpower to dealing</v>

1100
01:07:59.531 --> 01:08:04.531
<v Speaker 5>with the Germans and the ostrow </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hungarians and all of a sudden south of </v>

1101
01:08:04.531 --> 01:08:08.161
<v Speaker 5>all that fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they now have their historic enemy </v>

1102
01:08:08.161 --> 01:08:08.620
<v Speaker 5>Turkey in the war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

1103
01:08:08.621 --> 01:08:10.720
<v Speaker 5>it's not that they're so afraid of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Turks,</v>

1104
01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:16.050
<v Speaker 5>it's they're afraid of taking any troops</v>
<v Speaker 5>away from the main battle front to </v>

1105
01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:19.870
<v Speaker 5>defend that area at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Same thing with the British and the </v>

1106
01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:23.111
<v Speaker 5>French.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now they have to take troops away from </v>

1107
01:08:23.111 --> 01:08:25.931
<v Speaker 5>places where they're using them against </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Germans and use them elsewhere so </v>

1108
01:08:25.931 --> 01:08:30.611
<v Speaker 5>the Germans aren't really getting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Turkish armies help as much as </v>

1109
01:08:30.611 --> 01:08:30.611
<v Speaker 5>they're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1110
01:08:30.611 --> 01:08:34.991
<v Speaker 5>the fact that the people they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting have to fight somewhere else </v>

1111
01:08:34.991 --> 01:08:34.991
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

1112
01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:38.130
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for our purposes,</v>

1113
01:08:38.131 --> 01:08:42.060
<v Speaker 5>there's a wonderful little moment right </v>
<v Speaker 5>at the beginning of Turkey's involvement</v>

1114
01:08:42.061 --> 01:08:45.630
<v Speaker 5>where the highest ranking figure in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Muslim world,</v>

1115
01:08:45.631 --> 01:08:50.631
<v Speaker 5>religious wise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>proclaims a jihad against the allies </v>

1116
01:08:50.631 --> 01:08:51.360
<v Speaker 5>against Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>France,</v>

1117
01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:52.410
<v Speaker 5>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Serbia,</v>

1118
01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:55.840
<v Speaker 5>and this is an era where the Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 5>world was,</v>

1119
01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:58.230
<v Speaker 5>was more united in a religious sense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1120
01:08:58.231 --> 01:09:03.231
<v Speaker 5>nowadays it's more like the Protestant </v>
<v Speaker 5>version of Christianity where there's a </v>

1121
01:09:03.231 --> 01:09:08.031
<v Speaker 5>lot of different religious leaders who </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of all have equal standing at this </v>

1122
01:09:08.031 --> 01:09:12.591
<v Speaker 5>time period.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The guy who was running the religion </v>

1123
01:09:12.591 --> 01:09:15.450
<v Speaker 5>from Turkey had not total control over </v>
<v Speaker 5>the religion,</v>

1124
01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:19.590
<v Speaker 5>but he carried a lot of weight and when </v>
<v Speaker 5>the war breaks out on November 14th,</v>

1125
01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:20.850
<v Speaker 5>19,</v>
<v Speaker 5>14,</v>

1126
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:23.520
<v Speaker 5>he proclaims a holy war against Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>France,</v>

1127
01:09:23.521 --> 01:09:24.300
<v Speaker 5>Serbia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Russia,</v>

1128
01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.390
<v Speaker 5>and this is big because Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>France,</v>

1129
01:09:27.570 --> 01:09:32.570
<v Speaker 5>and Russia all have huge Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 5>populations and Germany's ambassador to </v>

1130
01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:39.170
<v Speaker 5>Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says that now you know the British </v>

1131
01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:39.170
<v Speaker 5>are going to burn up in Jihad.</v>

1132
01:09:40.290 --> 01:09:42.390
<v Speaker 5>Whether or not that's what really </v>
<v Speaker 5>happens.</v>

1133
01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:45.060
<v Speaker 5>If you're Britain and France and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>Russia,</v>

1134
01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:50.300
<v Speaker 5>you need to be concerned about that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>now you need to divert forces from other</v>

1135
01:09:50.611 --> 01:09:53.490
<v Speaker 5>crucial fronts to deal with this new </v>
<v Speaker 5>dilemma.</v>

1136
01:09:53.970 --> 01:09:56.670
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Turkey is and has been for more than 100</v>

1137
01:09:56.671 --> 01:10:01.671
<v Speaker 5>years known as the sick man of Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've just fought two wars before the </v>

1138
01:10:02.971 --> 01:10:07.971
<v Speaker 5>first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>breaks out the first and second Balkan </v>

1139
01:10:07.971 --> 01:10:09.890
<v Speaker 5>war and lost most of those European </v>
<v Speaker 5>possessions there.</v>

1140
01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:12.210
<v Speaker 5>Penniless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a disaster.</v>

1141
01:10:12.211 --> 01:10:17.211
<v Speaker 5>They just bought two battleships,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which they had to ask their citizens to </v>

1142
01:10:17.551 --> 01:10:21.270
<v Speaker 5>essentially donate the money for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They purchased them from Britain,</v>

1143
01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:23.610
<v Speaker 5>and then when the war broke out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Britain kept them,</v>

1144
01:10:23.850 --> 01:10:26.790
<v Speaker 5>which was another reason the church were</v>
<v Speaker 5>not too happy with the allies.</v>

1145
01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:32.660
<v Speaker 5>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fact that Turkey is going to be in </v>

1146
01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:35.271
<v Speaker 5>the war means that the British who have </v>
<v Speaker 5>controlled Egypt for some time now have </v>

1147
01:10:36.661 --> 01:10:39.540
<v Speaker 5>to worry about Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to worry about the Suez Canal.</v>

1148
01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:44.780
<v Speaker 5>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the era where oil is finally </v>

1149
01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:48.861
<v Speaker 5>becoming important in uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right before the first world war breaks </v>

1150
01:10:48.861 --> 01:10:51.891
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Britain lays down it's first ships that </v>

1151
01:10:51.891 --> 01:10:54.681
<v Speaker 5>are going to burn oil instead of coal </v>
<v Speaker 5>and everybody is starting to see that </v>

1152
01:10:55.291 --> 01:11:00.291
<v Speaker 5>not only is oil important,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the Middle East is a place that has </v>

1153
01:11:00.291 --> 01:11:02.820
<v Speaker 5>a lot of it and now the Middle East is </v>
<v Speaker 5>going up in flames.</v>

1154
01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:09.300
<v Speaker 5>Some of those flames probably would have</v>
<v Speaker 5>been very welcome on the eastern front </v>

1155
01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:13.621
<v Speaker 5>at this point where the Russians and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Germans and the ostrow Hungarians are </v>

1156
01:11:13.621 --> 01:11:14.130
<v Speaker 5>locked in mortal combat because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>begins</v>

1157
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:19.130
<v Speaker 1>to freeze at the end of the year as one </v>
<v Speaker 1>might expect they may be dealing with in</v>

1158
01:11:19.981 --> 01:11:24.981
<v Speaker 1>a rain and historic cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the coldest winters on memory on </v>

1159
01:11:24.981 --> 01:11:27.390
<v Speaker 1>the western front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the coldest winters in memory on the</v>

1160
01:11:27.391 --> 01:11:32.391
<v Speaker 1>western front are pretty darn average on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eastern front and the weather </v>

1161
01:11:32.391 --> 01:11:33.270
<v Speaker 1>conditions slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone down,</v>

1162
01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:39.080
<v Speaker 1>the eastern commanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hindenburg and Ludendorff also don't </v>

1163
01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:40.530
<v Speaker 1>have enough troops to do anything truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>momentous.</v>

1164
01:11:40.531 --> 01:11:45.531
<v Speaker 1>They keep begging Falcon hine in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kaiser for them and they keep getting </v>

1165
01:11:45.531 --> 01:11:49.491
<v Speaker 1>rebuffed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Russians are inapt when they're </v>

1166
01:11:49.591 --> 01:11:54.591
<v Speaker 1>attacking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're very tough when they're </v>

1167
01:11:54.591 --> 01:11:56.571
<v Speaker 1>defending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so things tend to slow down and the </v>

1168
01:11:56.571 --> 01:11:59.541
<v Speaker 1>Russians tend to go on the defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Austral Hungarians are already </v>

1169
01:11:59.541 --> 01:11:59.610
<v Speaker 1>almost done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1170
01:11:59.670 --> 01:12:04.670
<v Speaker 1>five months into the war and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting the last offensive that they </v>

1171
01:12:04.670 --> 01:12:04.860
<v Speaker 1>will launch independently in the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

1172
01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:09.960
<v Speaker 1>They already have a giant fortress with </v>
<v Speaker 1>150,000</v>

1173
01:12:09.961 --> 01:12:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Austro-hungarian troops in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by the Russians.</v>

1174
01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a bad situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weather slows everything down and if</v>

1175
01:12:16.711 --> 01:12:19.980
<v Speaker 1>you actually try to follow the various </v>
<v Speaker 1>battles going on,</v>

1176
01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:25.280
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice that there's a rhythm to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them that makes it difficult for </v>

1177
01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:27.120
<v Speaker 1>anything to ever be solved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1178
01:12:27.121 --> 01:12:32.121
<v Speaker 1>one side moves forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other side moves back and then you </v>

1179
01:12:32.121 --> 01:12:32.121
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they reversed course.</v>

1180
01:12:32.121 --> 01:12:36.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm historian Peter Hart does a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>good rundown of the rhythm of the </v>

1181
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.401
<v Speaker 1>eastern front at this time and sums up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the first six months of war </v>

1182
01:12:40.981 --> 01:12:42.390
<v Speaker 1>ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1183
01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:45.510
<v Speaker 1>in Philadelphia and Poland and places </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1184
01:12:45.511 --> 01:12:50.511
<v Speaker 1>When he writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote the seesaw nature of the fighting </v>

1185
01:12:50.511 --> 01:12:52.440
<v Speaker 1>in the east two steps forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three steps back.</v>

1186
01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:57.590
<v Speaker 1>One step forward was becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly apparent to all along the </v>

1187
01:12:57.590 --> 01:13:01.560
<v Speaker 1>line in the north for all their efforts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians only managed to hold onto a</v>

1188
01:13:01.561 --> 01:13:04.560
<v Speaker 1>token sliver of east Prussia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In contrast,</v>

1189
01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:07.860
<v Speaker 1>they lost much of Russian Poland to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>German advance,</v>

1190
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:13.070
<v Speaker 1>but the strategic drawback of occupying </v>
<v Speaker 1>this territory was such that it was not </v>

1191
01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:15.120
<v Speaker 1>a particular disadvantage in the broader</v>
<v Speaker 1>scheme of things.</v>

1192
01:13:15.450 --> 01:13:20.450
<v Speaker 1>It was in the south against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Austrians that the Russians had made </v>

1193
01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:23.700
<v Speaker 1>their biggest gains as they had overrun </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly all of Austrian Galitzianers.</v>

1194
01:13:24.090 --> 01:13:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Just as on the western front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The scale of the forces involved had </v>

1195
01:13:29.090 --> 01:13:30.060
<v Speaker 1>been incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the end of the year,</v>

1196
01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:35.270
<v Speaker 1>143 Russian divisions faced 53 Austrian </v>
<v Speaker 1>and 38 German divisions.</v>

1197
01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Losses on all sides had been simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathtaking.</v>

1198
01:13:39.930 --> 01:13:43.710
<v Speaker 1>By the end of 1914,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to 750,000</v>

1199
01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Russian soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>500,000</v>

1200
01:13:45.931 --> 01:13:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Austro-hungarian and 140,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans had become casualties.</v>

1201
01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:55.230
<v Speaker 1>All this in just five frantic months of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mayhem and the quote,</v>

1202
01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:01.320
<v Speaker 1>it will await a change in weather </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions before that front heats up.</v>

1203
01:14:01.321 --> 01:14:06.321
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throughout this most inhumane of </v>

1204
01:14:06.321 --> 01:14:11.061
<v Speaker 1>conflicts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are tons of stories of prisoners </v>

1205
01:14:11.061 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 1>being killed and horrible things being</v>

1206
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:17.190
<v Speaker 5>done all over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean when you have millions and </v>

1207
01:14:17.190 --> 01:14:19.380
<v Speaker 5>millions of men involved in warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are going to be stories that run </v>

1208
01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:22.750
<v Speaker 5>the gamut.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The ones though that sort of reinforce,</v>

1209
01:14:23.530 --> 01:14:28.530
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your connection to humanity are there </v>

1210
01:14:28.530 --> 01:14:31.891
<v Speaker 5>too and they deserve to be pointed out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes they were on an individual </v>

1211
01:14:31.891 --> 01:14:35.161
<v Speaker 5>level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a story from the western front </v>

1212
01:14:35.161 --> 01:14:37.861
<v Speaker 5>that I like right around the time of </v>
<v Speaker 5>pray about a British soldier named </v>

1213
01:14:37.861 --> 01:14:40.420
<v Speaker 5>Willie Frazier who was wounded in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>shoulder and who gets stuck,</v>

1214
01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:45.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in place as the Germans overrun his </v>

1215
01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:48.010
<v Speaker 5>position and the stories were counted by</v>
<v Speaker 5>author Winston groom.</v>

1216
01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:53.820
<v Speaker 5>Here's groom talking about frazier </v>
<v Speaker 5>injured on the battlefield.</v>

1217
01:14:54.010 --> 01:14:59.010
<v Speaker 5>Quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his shoulder had been shattered by </v>

1218
01:14:59.010 --> 01:15:01.681
<v Speaker 5>shrapnel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was fighting and killing all </v>

1219
01:15:01.681 --> 01:15:04.141
<v Speaker 5>around and the Germans captured him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Having studied German in Frankfurt in </v>

1220
01:15:04.141 --> 01:15:08.191
<v Speaker 5>1909,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was astonished to hear a German </v>

1221
01:15:08.191 --> 01:15:08.660
<v Speaker 5>sergeant yell out in order to shoot him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Will.</v>

1222
01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.710
<v Speaker 5>He yelled to a German officer and when </v>
<v Speaker 5>the officer spoke,</v>

1223
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:16.830
<v Speaker 5>really recognized his accent and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>asked if he was from Frankfurt when the </v>

1224
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:19.120
<v Speaker 5>officer replied that he was Willie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>asked him in German,</v>

1225
01:15:19.330 --> 01:15:24.330
<v Speaker 5>don't you wish you were there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the two men exchanged forced grins </v>

1226
01:15:24.330 --> 01:15:27.880
<v Speaker 5>and the officer ordered his men not to </v>
<v Speaker 5>harm frazier and quote.</v>

1227
01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:32.810
<v Speaker 5>You can find stories like that all </v>
<v Speaker 5>throughout the war.</v>

1228
01:15:32.811 --> 01:15:36.710
<v Speaker 5>People whose humanity shines through on </v>
<v Speaker 5>an individual basis,</v>

1229
01:15:36.711 --> 01:15:38.120
<v Speaker 5>on all sides.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

1230
01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:43.330
<v Speaker 5>no one had a monopoly on that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there were times when the humanity </v>

1231
01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:48.221
<v Speaker 5>sort of just burst forth and mass </v>
<v Speaker 5>spontaneously.</v>

1232
01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:52.460
<v Speaker 5>None more famous may be overrated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people say,</v>

1233
01:15:52.461 --> 01:15:57.461
<v Speaker 5>but I don't see how it can be overrated </v>
<v Speaker 5>than what happened on Christmas Eve.</v>

1234
01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:59.180
<v Speaker 5>Nineteen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>14.</v>

1235
01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:03.230
<v Speaker 5>Especially on the western front.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The conditions are horrible.</v>

1236
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:08.470
<v Speaker 5>It's freezing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know your feet are stuck in gruelle </v>

1237
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:10.790
<v Speaker 5>mud water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can't get any worse,</v>

1238
01:16:10.791 --> 01:16:15.791
<v Speaker 5>and then it all freezes in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're stuck out there in the cold and </v>

1239
01:16:15.791 --> 01:16:18.941
<v Speaker 5>then all of a sudden the people on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>western front see something relatively </v>

1240
01:16:19.161 --> 01:16:23.330
<v Speaker 5>unbelievable in a conflict where you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have shells going on every second,</v>

1241
01:16:23.331 --> 01:16:28.331
<v Speaker 5>snipers picking off anyone who raises </v>
<v Speaker 5>his head above the trench and then all </v>

1242
01:16:28.331 --> 01:16:30.440
<v Speaker 5>of a sudden soldiers reported hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>singing,</v>

1243
01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:36.460
<v Speaker 5>and seeing weird colored lights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The colored lights were often coming </v>

1244
01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:42.520
<v Speaker 5>from the German trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Soldier Yulia is collection was in one </v>

1245
01:16:42.891 --> 01:16:47.540
<v Speaker 5>of those trenches opposite the French </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying the conditions were horrible,</v>

1246
01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:50.300
<v Speaker 5>but on Christmas Eve,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is what happened.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Quote</v>

1248
01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:55.290
<v Speaker 5>Christmas in the trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was bitterly cold.</v>

1249
01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.280
<v Speaker 5>We had procured a pine tree for there </v>
<v Speaker 5>were no for trees to be had.</v>

1250
01:16:59.610 --> 01:17:02.340
<v Speaker 5>We had decorated the tree with candles </v>
<v Speaker 5>and cookies.</v>

1251
01:17:02.610 --> 01:17:07.610
<v Speaker 5>We had imitated the snow with wadding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Christmas trees were burning everywhere </v>

1252
01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:11.961
<v Speaker 5>in the trenches and at midnight all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>were lifted onto the pair of it with </v>

1253
01:17:11.961 --> 01:17:14.150
<v Speaker 5>their burning candles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And along the whole line,</v>

1254
01:17:14.151 --> 01:17:17.630
<v Speaker 5>German soldiers began to sing Christmas </v>
<v Speaker 5>songs in chorus,</v>

1255
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:22.520
<v Speaker 5>old Thou blissful old thou joyous mercy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bringing Christmas time.</v>

1256
01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:28.210
<v Speaker 5>Hundreds of men he writes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>were singing the song in that fearful </v>

1257
01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:28.310
<v Speaker 5>would not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A shot was fired.</v>

1258
01:17:28.730 --> 01:17:31.430
<v Speaker 5>The French had ceased firing along the </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole line.</v>

1259
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:35.570
<v Speaker 5>That night I was with a company that was</v>
<v Speaker 5>only five paces away from the enemy.</v>

1260
01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:40.900
<v Speaker 5>The Christmas candles were burning </v>
<v Speaker 5>brightly and were renewed again and </v>

1261
01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:44.621
<v Speaker 5>again for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We heard no shots from everywhere </v>

1262
01:17:44.621 --> 01:17:46.130
<v Speaker 5>throughout the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He writes one good hear,</v>

1263
01:17:46.131 --> 01:17:50.690
<v Speaker 5>powerful Carol's come floating over </v>
<v Speaker 5>peace on earth and such.</v>

1264
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.950
<v Speaker 5>The French,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>

1265
01:17:51.951 --> 01:17:56.170
<v Speaker 5>left their trenches and stood on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>parapet without any fear there.</v>

1266
01:17:56.180 --> 01:18:00.440
<v Speaker 5>They stood quite overpowered by emotion </v>
<v Speaker 5>and all of them with cap in hand.</v>

1267
01:18:00.830 --> 01:18:05.830
<v Speaker 5>We too had issued from our trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We exchange gifts with the French </v>

1268
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:06.350
<v Speaker 5>chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cigarettes,</v>

1269
01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:11.380
<v Speaker 5>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were all laughing and so where we </v>

1270
01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:11.380
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We did not know,</v>

1271
01:18:11.390 --> 01:18:16.390
<v Speaker 5>then everybody went back to his trench </v>
<v Speaker 5>and incessantly the carol resounded </v>

1272
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.640
<v Speaker 5>evermore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>solidly,</v>

1273
01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:21.590
<v Speaker 5>evermore longingly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh Thou blissful and quote</v>

1274
01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:26.980
<v Speaker 5>private william quinten in the trenches </v>
<v Speaker 5>on christmas eve,</v>

1275
01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:31.630
<v Speaker 5>on the british side wrote about a </v>
<v Speaker 5>similar situation farther down the line,</v>

1276
01:18:31.710 --> 01:18:35.590
<v Speaker 5>quote all around us lay about three </v>
<v Speaker 5>inches of snow.</v>

1277
01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:39.370
<v Speaker 5>A typical picture postcard christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things were very quiet,</v>

1278
01:18:39.850 --> 01:18:43.600
<v Speaker 5>that peace and goodwill to all men </v>
<v Speaker 5>feeling seemed to be in the air.</v>

1279
01:18:43.870 --> 01:18:46.750
<v Speaker 5>We could hear the germans still strafing</v>
<v Speaker 5>up separate way,</v>

1280
01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:49.810
<v Speaker 5>but the next night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>christmas eve even up there,</v>

1281
01:18:49.811 --> 01:18:52.720
<v Speaker 5>it was much quieter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something in the direction of the german</v>

1282
01:18:52.721 --> 01:18:57.721
<v Speaker 5>lines caused us to rub our eyes and look</v>
<v Speaker 5>again here and they're showing just </v>

1283
01:18:57.721 --> 01:19:02.491
<v Speaker 5>above the parapet we could see very </v>
<v Speaker 5>faintly would look like very small </v>

1284
01:19:02.491 --> 01:19:03.670
<v Speaker 5>colored lights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was this?</v>

1285
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.000
<v Speaker 5>Was it some prearranged signal and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fore runner of an attack or was it to </v>

1286
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:13.591
<v Speaker 5>make us curious and thus expose </v>
<v Speaker 5>ourselves to a sudden raking of machine </v>

1287
01:19:13.591 --> 01:19:17.551
<v Speaker 5>gun fire?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were very suspicious and we were </v>

1288
01:19:17.551 --> 01:19:19.210
<v Speaker 5>discussing the strange move of the enemy</v>
<v Speaker 5>when something even stranger happened.</v>

1289
01:19:19.690 --> 01:19:22.600
<v Speaker 5>The germans were actually singing not </v>
<v Speaker 5>very loud,</v>

1290
01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:25.840
<v Speaker 5>but there was no mistaking it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We began to get interested.</v>

1291
01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.540
<v Speaker 5>The enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least we're going to enjoy themselves</v>

1292
01:19:28.541 --> 01:19:30.250
<v Speaker 5>as much as the circumstances would </v>
<v Speaker 5>permit.</v>

1293
01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:33.670
<v Speaker 5>Suddenly across the snow clad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no man's land.</v>

1294
01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:38.860
<v Speaker 5>A strong clear voice rang out singing </v>
<v Speaker 5>the opening lines of annie lori.</v>

1295
01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:42.040
<v Speaker 5>It was sung in perfect english and we </v>
<v Speaker 5>were spellbound.</v>

1296
01:19:42.370 --> 01:19:46.060
<v Speaker 5>No other sound,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this unknown singer's voice to us.</v>

1297
01:19:46.061 --> 01:19:48.280
<v Speaker 5>It seemed like the war had suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 5>stopped,</v>

1298
01:19:48.610 --> 01:19:51.580
<v Speaker 5>stopped to listen to this song from one </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the enemy,</v>

1299
01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:56.020
<v Speaker 5>not a sound from friend or foe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and as the last notes died away,</v>

1300
01:19:56.290 --> 01:20:01.120
<v Speaker 5>a spontaneous outburst of clapping arose</v>
<v Speaker 5>from our trenches encore,</v>

1301
01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:03.960
<v Speaker 5>good old fritz.</v>
<v Speaker 5>End quote.</v>

1302
01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:10.900
<v Speaker 5>All along the line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the two sides would have this </v>

1303
01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:14.121
<v Speaker 5>interesting moment where they kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>began to emerge from the trenches little</v>

1304
01:20:14.671 --> 01:20:16.320
<v Speaker 5>by little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1305
01:20:16.321 --> 01:20:20.640
<v Speaker 5>a place where they couldn't stick a </v>
<v Speaker 5>finger up without having a shot off just</v>

1306
01:20:20.641 --> 01:20:25.641
<v Speaker 5>hours before and everybody must have </v>
<v Speaker 5>been so incredibly brave to try,</v>

1307
01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:31.310
<v Speaker 5>but one side would raise themselves up a</v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit and the other side would </v>

1308
01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:32.670
<v Speaker 5>raise themselves up a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 5>until both sides.</v>

1309
01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:36.840
<v Speaker 5>In this hellish environment where nobody</v>
<v Speaker 5>could go anywhere near,</v>

1310
01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:40.800
<v Speaker 5>you know the open air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're standing apart from each other,</v>

1311
01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:45.870
<v Speaker 5>gazing right at the enemy in no man's </v>
<v Speaker 5>land on christmas,</v>

1312
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:50.720
<v Speaker 5>private.</v>
<v Speaker 5>William quintin again wrote quote,</v>

1313
01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:56.700
<v Speaker 5>as daylight crept in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were surprised to see the germans </v>

1314
01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:59.470
<v Speaker 5>waist high out of their trenches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gazing across at us with impunity.</v>

1315
01:20:59.770 --> 01:21:02.020
<v Speaker 5>Imagine the position,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whereas yesterday,</v>

1316
01:21:02.021 --> 01:21:07.021
<v Speaker 5>the mere sight of a bit of field gray </v>
<v Speaker 5>uniform would have caused a dozen </v>

1317
01:21:07.021 --> 01:21:07.021
<v Speaker 5>british rifles to crack.</v>

1318
01:21:07.021 --> 01:21:11.790
<v Speaker 5>Here was the enemy in full view of us </v>
<v Speaker 5>gazing serenely across no man's land at </v>

1319
01:21:12.071 --> 01:21:15.520
<v Speaker 5>us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we had him to us in the front line.</v>

1320
01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:20.670
<v Speaker 5>The whole world had changed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We could take stock of our surroundings </v>

1321
01:21:20.670 --> 01:21:21.220
<v Speaker 5>that are leisure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At 9:00</v>

1322
01:21:21.221 --> 01:21:26.221
<v Speaker 5>precisely,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the german burying party climbed from </v>

1323
01:21:26.221 --> 01:21:26.680
<v Speaker 5>the trenches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shovels and picks on their shoulders.</v>

1324
01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:30.040
<v Speaker 5>They advanced about 10 yards in our </v>
<v Speaker 5>direction and waited.</v>

1325
01:21:30.041 --> 01:21:34.810
<v Speaker 5>Expectedly a word from our company </v>
<v Speaker 5>officer and our party were soon out.</v>

1326
01:21:35.170 --> 01:21:40.170
<v Speaker 5>The officers looked on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently conversing the digging party </v>

1327
01:21:40.170 --> 01:21:41.950
<v Speaker 5>soon lost interest in their task and </v>
<v Speaker 5>before long we're busy,</v>

1328
01:21:41.951 --> 01:21:46.951
<v Speaker 5>fraternizing cigarettes were being </v>
<v Speaker 5>exchanged and they seem to be enjoying </v>

1329
01:21:46.951 --> 01:21:48.550
<v Speaker 5>themselves immensely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Needless to say,</v>

1330
01:21:48.551 --> 01:21:53.551
<v Speaker 5>before very long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we in the trenches were soon out on top </v>

1331
01:21:53.551 --> 01:21:56.820
<v Speaker 5>sauntering about the snow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but keeping this side of wire </v>

1332
01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:57.450
<v Speaker 5>entanglements.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Likewise,</v>

1333
01:21:57.451 --> 01:22:02.451
<v Speaker 5>the germans for the whole of that day </v>
<v Speaker 5>and for many days to come friend and foe</v>

1334
01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:07.760
<v Speaker 5>mixed freely out on no man's land,</v>
<v Speaker 5>except for the fact that a few of the </v>

1335
01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.370
<v Speaker 5>enemy could speak a little english.</v>

1336
01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:11.580
<v Speaker 5>We found the language difficulty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bar to conversation,</v>

1337
01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:16.820
<v Speaker 5>but we may do with signs and gestures.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember distinctly a german holding </v>

1338
01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:19.020
<v Speaker 5>out an open box of chocolates for me to </v>
<v Speaker 5>take one.</v>

1339
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:22.620
<v Speaker 5>The germans wanted to play a football </v>
<v Speaker 5>match on no man's land,</v>

1340
01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:25.740
<v Speaker 5>but our officers would not allow it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the quote,</v>

1341
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:32.150
<v Speaker 5>there are reports though of british and </v>
<v Speaker 5>german troops engaging in soccer matches</v>

1342
01:22:32.450 --> 01:22:37.450
<v Speaker 5>up and down the line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was an amazing spontaneous outburst </v>

1343
01:22:37.671 --> 01:22:42.671
<v Speaker 5>of humanity and it's so appalled the </v>
<v Speaker 5>higher leadership that they made sure in</v>

1344
01:22:44.841 --> 01:22:47.750
<v Speaker 5>future christmases,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing like this would ever be allowed.</v>

1345
01:22:47.751 --> 01:22:52.751
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you thought the war was bad before </v>

1346
01:22:52.751 --> 01:22:55.460
<v Speaker 5>it's about to get worse and I'll let </v>
<v Speaker 5>winston churchill.</v>

1347
01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:01.240
<v Speaker 5>He in a leadership position during this </v>
<v Speaker 5>part of the war setup 1915 a time when </v>

1348
01:23:03.291 --> 01:23:08.291
<v Speaker 5>he says men lost control of the conflict</v>
<v Speaker 5>and forces took over.</v>

1349
01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:11.270
<v Speaker 5>He wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

1350
01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:16.980
<v Speaker 5>the year 19,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15 was faded to be disastrous to the </v>

1351
01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:19.420
<v Speaker 5>cause of the allies and the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the mistakes of this year,</v>

1352
01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:23.440
<v Speaker 5>the opportunity was lost of confining </v>
<v Speaker 5>the conflagration within limits,</v>

1353
01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:26.200
<v Speaker 5>which though enormous we're not </v>
<v Speaker 5>uncontrolled.</v>

1354
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:31.590
<v Speaker 5>Thereafter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fire roared on until it burned </v>

1355
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.590
<v Speaker 5>itself out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thereafter,</v>

1356
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:36.120
<v Speaker 5>events past very largely outside the </v>
<v Speaker 5>scope of conscious choice governments </v>

1357
01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:40.981
<v Speaker 5>and individuals conformed to the rhythm </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the tragedy and suede and staggered </v>

1358
01:23:40.981 --> 01:23:45.931
<v Speaker 5>forward in helpless violence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>slaughtering and squandering on ever </v>

1359
01:23:45.931 --> 01:23:50.101
<v Speaker 5>increasing scales till injuries were </v>
<v Speaker 5>brought to the structure of human </v>

1360
01:23:50.101 --> 01:23:54.121
<v Speaker 5>society,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which a century will not have face and </v>

1361
01:23:54.121 --> 01:23:55.540
<v Speaker 5>which may conceivably proved fatal to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the presence civilization.</v>

1362
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:57.670
<v Speaker 5>But in january 19,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15,</v>

1363
01:23:57.970 --> 01:24:00.700
<v Speaker 5>the terrific affair was still not </v>
<v Speaker 5>unmanageable.</v>

1364
01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:05.910
<v Speaker 5>It could have been grasped and human </v>
<v Speaker 5>hands and brought to rest in righteous </v>

1365
01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:07.990
<v Speaker 5>and fruitful victory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Before the world was exhausted,</v>

1366
01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:13.230
<v Speaker 5>before the nations were broken,</v>
<v Speaker 5>before the empires were shattered to </v>

1367
01:24:13.230 --> 01:24:16.921
<v Speaker 5>pieces before europe was ruined,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was not to be he writes,</v>

1368
01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:21.490
<v Speaker 5>mankind was not to escape so easily from</v>
<v Speaker 5>the catastrophe in which it had involved</v>

1369
01:24:21.491 --> 01:24:21.970
<v Speaker 5>itself.</v>

1370
01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:25.790
<v Speaker 5>Pride was everywhere to be humbled and </v>
<v Speaker 5>nowhere to receive it.</v>

1371
01:24:25.791 --> 01:24:30.791
<v Speaker 5>Satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no splendid harmony was to crown the </v>

1372
01:24:30.791 --> 01:24:33.040
<v Speaker 5>wonderful achievements,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no prize to reward the sacrifices of the</v>

1373
01:24:33.041 --> 01:24:35.440
<v Speaker 5>combatants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Victory was to be bought,</v>

1374
01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:38.830
<v Speaker 5>so deer has to be almost </v>
<v Speaker 5>indistinguishable from defeat.</v>

1375
01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.590
<v Speaker 5>It was not to give even security to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>victors.</v>

1376
01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:46.860
<v Speaker 5>There never was to be the silence </v>
<v Speaker 5>following the great words of peace to </v>

1377
01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:48.670
<v Speaker 5>the convulsions of the struggle must </v>
<v Speaker 5>succeed.</v>

1378
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:53.790
<v Speaker 5>The impotent turmoil of the aftermath,</v>
<v Speaker 5>noble hopes high comradeship and </v>

1379
01:24:53.831 --> 01:24:58.831
<v Speaker 5>glorious daring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're in every nation to lead only to </v>

1380
01:24:58.831 --> 01:24:58.831
<v Speaker 5>disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>disillusion,</v>

1381
01:24:58.831 --> 01:25:03.810
<v Speaker 5>and frustration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The sufferings and impoverishment of </v>

1382
01:25:03.810 --> 01:25:06.130
<v Speaker 5>peoples might arrest their warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The collapse of the defeated might still</v>

1383
01:25:06.131 --> 01:25:11.131
<v Speaker 5>the cannonade,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but their hatreds continue on appeased </v>

1384
01:25:11.131 --> 01:25:14.230
<v Speaker 5>and their quarrels are still unsettled.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The most complete victory ever gained in</v>

1385
01:25:14.231 --> 01:25:19.231
<v Speaker 5>arms has failed to solve the european </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem or to remove the dangers which </v>

1386
01:25:19.231 --> 01:25:22.050
<v Speaker 5>produced the war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>End quote,</v>

1387
01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:29.520
<v Speaker 5>the war was entering a new phase.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The phase of stalemate.</v>

1388
01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.350
<v Speaker 5>What do you do to break the stalemate?</v>

1389
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:39.110
<v Speaker 5>That Was the main challenge facing </v>
<v Speaker 5>commanders on all sides.</v>

1390
01:25:39.530 --> 01:25:43.850
<v Speaker 5>As 1915 rolls around and you know later </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the war,</v>

1391
01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.940
<v Speaker 5>the allied generals especially will get </v>
<v Speaker 5>labeled,</v>

1392
01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:52.220
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as butchers and and and blockheads and </v>

1393
01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:55.361
<v Speaker 5>people who can't think their way out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>a paper bag and and some of it's </v>

1394
01:25:55.361 --> 01:25:59.441
<v Speaker 5>justified later in the conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we have to cut them quite a lot of </v>

1395
01:25:59.441 --> 01:26:02.501
<v Speaker 5>slack early on because as the western </v>
<v Speaker 5>front in the trench warfare and </v>

1396
01:26:02.501 --> 01:26:07.001
<v Speaker 5>everything begins to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of these generals on all sides are </v>

1397
01:26:07.001 --> 01:26:08.510
<v Speaker 5>confronted with circumstances that there</v>
<v Speaker 5>are no metrics for.</v>

1398
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:11.720
<v Speaker 5>There is no data on how you deal with </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

1399
01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:17.020
<v Speaker 5>They have to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have to experiment and then they </v>

1400
01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:18.350
<v Speaker 5>have to look at the data afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is is in this conflict,</v>

1401
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:21.500
<v Speaker 5>in the experimentation in this military </v>
<v Speaker 5>laboratory,</v>

1402
01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:26.770
<v Speaker 5>human beings have the lab rats and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>learn that the cost of human carnage.</v>

1403
01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:32.330
<v Speaker 5>Now the allies are more willing to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

1404
01:26:32.331 --> 01:26:36.620
<v Speaker 5>They have more lab rats to play with and</v>
<v Speaker 5>this becomes a huge feature in the early</v>

1405
01:26:36.621 --> 01:26:40.070
<v Speaker 5>part of 1915 because if you are sir John</v>
<v Speaker 5>French,</v>

1406
01:26:40.071 --> 01:26:45.071
<v Speaker 5>the british commander,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or if you are joseph shaft for the </v>

1407
01:26:45.071 --> 01:26:46.580
<v Speaker 5>french commander,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that if this thing has devolved</v>

1408
01:26:46.581 --> 01:26:49.670
<v Speaker 5>from a wild swinging boxing encounter in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first round,</v>

1409
01:26:49.671 --> 01:26:54.671
<v Speaker 5>just something that's more like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrestling match where both combatants </v>

1410
01:26:54.671 --> 01:26:56.240
<v Speaker 5>are holding each other in a death grip,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that works in your favor.</v>

1411
01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:59.330
<v Speaker 5>You're the stronger combatant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have more men,</v>

1412
01:26:59.331 --> 01:27:01.670
<v Speaker 5>you have more industrial power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>you control the seas.</v>

1413
01:27:01.850 --> 01:27:03.950
<v Speaker 5>If it's going to go that way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to win.</v>

1414
01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:09.250
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you may not want to have to be as hurt </v>

1415
01:27:09.250 --> 01:27:10.520
<v Speaker 5>as you may have to be to make that work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but worst case scenario,</v>

1416
01:27:10.730 --> 01:27:13.400
<v Speaker 5>long term,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to win that encounter.</v>

1417
01:27:13.730 --> 01:27:18.730
<v Speaker 5>It's the german commanders that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>forced to think outside the box because </v>

1418
01:27:18.730 --> 01:27:20.720
<v Speaker 5>they're not going to win that encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is,</v>

1419
01:27:20.990 --> 01:27:25.310
<v Speaker 5>is the box that they have to think </v>
<v Speaker 5>outside of is the one that was worked on</v>

1420
01:27:25.311 --> 01:27:30.311
<v Speaker 5>for decades before the first world war </v>
<v Speaker 5>came out to create laws of war,</v>

1421
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:34.430
<v Speaker 5>humanitarian restrictions on what you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could do,</v>

1422
01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:37.460
<v Speaker 5>ways to protect civilians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>noncombatants,</v>

1423
01:27:37.461 --> 01:27:39.320
<v Speaker 5>and even combatants from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1424
01:27:39.321 --> 01:27:44.030
<v Speaker 5>things that were considered to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>unsportsmanlike or extra horrific,</v>

1425
01:27:44.031 --> 01:27:49.031
<v Speaker 5>more horrific than it needed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember in the first episode we talked </v>

1426
01:27:49.031 --> 01:27:52.901
<v Speaker 5>about things like the hague conference,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ways to make war conform to </v>

1427
01:27:52.901 --> 01:27:57.491
<v Speaker 5>international law.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem was the germans in the </v>

1428
01:27:57.491 --> 01:27:59.570
<v Speaker 5>central powers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're now in that position that everyone</v>

1429
01:27:59.571 --> 01:28:04.571
<v Speaker 5>kind of knew was going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know when you wrote those laws of </v>

1430
01:28:04.571 --> 01:28:08.141
<v Speaker 5>war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is they have to decide whether or </v>

1431
01:28:08.141 --> 01:28:10.451
<v Speaker 5>not adhering to international law is </v>
<v Speaker 5>worth losing a war over and you begin to</v>

1432
01:28:12.341 --> 01:28:17.341
<v Speaker 5>see both sides try to use asymmetrical </v>
<v Speaker 5>warfare and new technology to break the </v>

1433
01:28:19.001 --> 01:28:24.001
<v Speaker 5>stalemate and a lot of what used are the</v>
<v Speaker 5>very things that were prohibited in </v>

1434
01:28:24.001 --> 01:28:27.991
<v Speaker 5>these prewar agreements.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A perfect example starts in late 1914 </v>

1435
01:28:28.191 --> 01:28:33.191
<v Speaker 5>when german warships open fire on </v>
<v Speaker 5>british coastal towns kill more than 100</v>

1436
01:28:34.190 --> 01:28:35.840
<v Speaker 5>british citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1437
01:28:35.870 --> 01:28:40.870
<v Speaker 5>becomes a wonderful propaganda tool for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the allies to cite the baby killers of </v>

1438
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:45.521
<v Speaker 5>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's nothing compared to what's </v>

1439
01:28:45.521 --> 01:28:47.921
<v Speaker 5>coming in 1915.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first thing that happens is a </v>

1440
01:28:47.921 --> 01:28:51.880
<v Speaker 5>absolute benchmark in warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When in january the germans start really</v>

1441
01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:58.070
<v Speaker 5>trying to get involved in what we call </v>
<v Speaker 5>today strategic bombing.</v>

1442
01:28:58.790 --> 01:29:03.790
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>aircraft had been in use since the very </v>

1443
01:29:03.790 --> 01:29:03.790
<v Speaker 5>moment the war started.</v>

1444
01:29:03.790 --> 01:29:07.460
<v Speaker 1>One of the excuses that the germans used</v>
<v Speaker 1>for attacking France was they said that </v>

1445
01:29:08.731 --> 01:29:12.690
<v Speaker 1>some plane had come from France and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombed nurenberg at the very moment that</v>

1446
01:29:12.691 --> 01:29:15.600
<v Speaker 1>the war started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probably nonsense,</v>

1447
01:29:15.810 --> 01:29:20.810
<v Speaker 1>but it shows that there were airplanes </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in the conflict from the very </v>

1448
01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:24.201
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in ways that really didn't involve </v>

1449
01:29:24.201 --> 01:29:27.141
<v Speaker 1>the laws of war very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all Of the air force's puT </v>

1450
01:29:27.141 --> 01:29:28.830
<v Speaker 1>together in the world when the war </v>
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>

1451
01:29:28.831 --> 01:29:33.831
<v Speaker 1>had less than 500 planes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what planes they did have turned out</v>

1452
01:29:34.111 --> 01:29:37.080
<v Speaker 1>to be wonderfully valuable tools for </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconnaissance,</v>

1453
01:29:37.230 --> 01:29:42.230
<v Speaker 1>which was what air power had been used </v>
<v Speaker 1>for earlier than this time.</v>

1454
01:29:42.361 --> 01:29:47.361
<v Speaker 1>Even in the american civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were hot air balloons that they </v>

1455
01:29:47.361 --> 01:29:48.390
<v Speaker 1>would use to see what the enemy was </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing in the distance.</v>

1456
01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Planes were wonderful for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also turned out to be fantastic in </v>

1457
01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:57.861
<v Speaker 1>the more technologically sophisticated </v>
<v Speaker 1>armies at what was known as artillery </v>

1458
01:29:57.861 --> 01:30:02.541
<v Speaker 1>spotting and that allowed your guns to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot at targets that the gunners </v>

1459
01:30:02.541 --> 01:30:03.300
<v Speaker 1>couldn't see.</v>

1460
01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:04.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could shoot,</v>

1461
01:30:04.891 --> 01:30:06.060
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1462
01:30:06.061 --> 01:30:11.061
<v Speaker 1>far away over a hill and if there was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>airplane there that could tell you what </v>

1463
01:30:11.061 --> 01:30:14.961
<v Speaker 1>was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was interesting enough to try </v>

1464
01:30:14.961 --> 01:30:15.120
<v Speaker 1>to explain without radios and everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was happening.</v>

1465
01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:20.390
<v Speaker 1>But they could tell you that your shot </v>
<v Speaker 1>fell short or went long or was too far </v>

1466
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:24.261
<v Speaker 1>to the left or too far to the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this gave a huge advantage to the </v>

1467
01:30:24.261 --> 01:30:24.810
<v Speaker 1>armies that could make that work for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1468
01:30:24.811 --> 01:30:27.150
<v Speaker 1>The less sophisticated armies like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>russians couldn't.</v>

1469
01:30:27.510 --> 01:30:29.640
<v Speaker 1>And hence we're relegated to shooting at</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1470
01:30:29.641 --> 01:30:33.330
<v Speaker 1>They could only see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this early on in the fighting,</v>

1471
01:30:33.331 --> 01:30:38.331
<v Speaker 1>you can see how primitive things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>because early on when aircraft would </v>

1472
01:30:38.331 --> 01:30:43.251
<v Speaker 1>encounter enemy aircraft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have any way to do anything </v>

1473
01:30:43.251 --> 01:30:45.150
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were taking hand guns,</v>

1474
01:30:45.151 --> 01:30:50.151
<v Speaker 1>these pilots up in the plane with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and trying to take pot shots with their </v>

1475
01:30:50.151 --> 01:30:50.790
<v Speaker 1>pistols at the enemy air pilots.</v>

1476
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:51.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you know,</v>

1477
01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:54.270
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated things are at this stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the war.</v>

1478
01:30:54.690 --> 01:30:59.690
<v Speaker 1>It's only when the germans run up </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the trench warfare and the </v>

1479
01:30:59.690 --> 01:31:03.150
<v Speaker 1>western front and they're forced to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start looking for things that might help</v>

1480
01:31:03.151 --> 01:31:05.940
<v Speaker 1>them break the stalemate that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed.</v>

1481
01:31:05.941 --> 01:31:08.400
<v Speaker 1>They had the greatest zeplin fleet in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

1482
01:31:09.190 --> 01:31:12.030
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] of course are lighter than </v>
<v Speaker 1>air aircraft,</v>

1483
01:31:12.031 --> 01:31:13.590
<v Speaker 1>like blimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dirigibles,</v>

1484
01:31:13.591 --> 01:31:15.690
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And before the war,</v>

1485
01:31:15.691 --> 01:31:20.691
<v Speaker 1>the germans had built 10 or 12 of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and had them sort of sitting aside when </v>

1486
01:31:20.691 --> 01:31:24.450
<v Speaker 1>the war started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which scared their enemies probably more</v>

1487
01:31:24.451 --> 01:31:29.451
<v Speaker 1>than they should have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sort of had a fleet in being role </v>

1488
01:31:29.451 --> 01:31:30.090
<v Speaker 1>where people like churchill in britain </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to be,</v>

1489
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:32.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about what are the journals,</v>

1490
01:31:32.091 --> 01:31:34.320
<v Speaker 1>zipline is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what might the german zepplins do.</v>

1491
01:31:34.710 --> 01:31:38.640
<v Speaker 1>That was probably out of all proportion </v>
<v Speaker 1>to what the german zepplins could do.</v>

1492
01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.670
<v Speaker 1>The germans tried to use them at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the war,</v>

1493
01:31:41.671 --> 01:31:44.640
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they invaded Belgium and had to try</v>

1494
01:31:44.641 --> 01:31:47.260
<v Speaker 1>to deal with those forts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of zepplins flew over and tried</v>

1495
01:31:47.261 --> 01:31:52.261
<v Speaker 1>to drop some bombs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when the stalemate on the western </v>

1496
01:31:52.261 --> 01:31:52.261
<v Speaker 1>front reaches its real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1497
01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:57.500
<v Speaker 1>calcification moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the germans start looking for ways to </v>

1498
01:31:57.500 --> 01:32:00.651
<v Speaker 1>use these tools that they have and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is no metrics just like there aren't any</v>

1499
01:32:00.761 --> 01:32:03.670
<v Speaker 1>metrics on the western front to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to break that stalemate.</v>

1500
01:32:03.671 --> 01:32:08.671
<v Speaker 1>There's no metrics that will tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the zepplins will do if they bomb </v>

1501
01:32:08.671 --> 01:32:13.020
<v Speaker 1>targets in another country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a british theorist who </v>

1502
01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:15.760
<v Speaker 1>suggested that the very powerlessness </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people,</v>

1503
01:32:16.090 --> 01:32:19.750
<v Speaker 1>you know in another country in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>home country feel when the enemy is able</v>

1504
01:32:19.751 --> 01:32:24.520
<v Speaker 1>to with impunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fly over your territory and bomb you.</v>

1505
01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:28.870
<v Speaker 1>He suggested that if they bombed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilians with confetti,</v>

1506
01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:30.430
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't make any difference.</v>

1507
01:32:30.430 --> 01:32:34.360
<v Speaker 1>It would still damage their morale </v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly because it's a feeling like you</v>

1508
01:32:34.361 --> 01:32:39.361
<v Speaker 1>can't be defended even at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a place that most people tend to feel </v>

1509
01:32:39.361 --> 01:32:42.490
<v Speaker 1>safe at this stage in military history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were people arguing,</v>

1510
01:32:42.670 --> 01:32:44.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the german high command saying,</v>

1511
01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:49.000
<v Speaker 1>for all we know these ziplines could win</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war and before the war,</v>

1512
01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:54.180
<v Speaker 1>at these big conferences that were part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of trying to come up with international </v>

1513
01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:54.490
<v Speaker 1>laws of war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1514
01:32:54.491 --> 01:32:57.670
<v Speaker 1>there were rules discussed about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombing should work.</v>

1515
01:32:57.671 --> 01:33:02.671
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should you have to give the city that </v>

1516
01:33:02.671 --> 01:33:04.531
<v Speaker 1>you're going to bomb a chance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrender before you bombed them and </v>

1517
01:33:04.531 --> 01:33:06.010
<v Speaker 1>lest you think only the germans were </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this.</v>

1518
01:33:06.011 --> 01:33:11.011
<v Speaker 1>Both the british and the french were </v>
<v Speaker 1>sending small bombing raids over into </v>

1519
01:33:11.011 --> 01:33:14.791
<v Speaker 1>Germany and Germany was sending small </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombing raids with aircraft that were </v>

1520
01:33:14.791 --> 01:33:17.810
<v Speaker 1>holding little hand bombs out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>open cockpits and dropping them.</v>

1521
01:33:17.890 --> 01:33:22.890
<v Speaker 1>Nothing significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing like sending large numbers of </v>

1522
01:33:22.890 --> 01:33:26.480
<v Speaker 1>zeppelins all together in bombing raids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in january,</v>

1523
01:33:26.481 --> 01:33:31.481
<v Speaker 1>in 1915,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the germans launched their first one of </v>

1524
01:33:31.481 --> 01:33:33.691
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go after some port facilities in </v>

1525
01:33:33.691 --> 01:33:38.071
<v Speaker 1>britain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with this is the same </v>

1526
01:33:38.071 --> 01:33:38.071
<v Speaker 1>problem they're going to have in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>early second world war,</v>

1527
01:33:38.071 --> 01:33:42.571
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may say you're trying to hit </v>

1528
01:33:42.571 --> 01:33:43.300
<v Speaker 1>military targets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the accuracy is so terrible.</v>

1529
01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:47.980
<v Speaker 1>You're lucky to fly over a city the size</v>
<v Speaker 1>of london and be able to hit it.</v>

1530
01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:52.410
<v Speaker 1>So these poor facilities end up being an</v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

1531
01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:54.970
<v Speaker 1>an early example of when civilians get </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit with these weapons,</v>

1532
01:33:54.971 --> 01:33:58.150
<v Speaker 1>they'll start bombing london in may 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15.</v>

1533
01:33:58.570 --> 01:34:03.570
<v Speaker 1>And of course this becomes a propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 1>victory right away for the allies who </v>

1534
01:34:03.570 --> 01:34:06.970
<v Speaker 1>again labeled the germans baby killers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which make the germans defensive.</v>

1535
01:34:06.971 --> 01:34:09.310
<v Speaker 1>As you might imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a wonderful letter from a german</v>

1536
01:34:09.311 --> 01:34:10.870
<v Speaker 1>zeplin leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1537
01:34:10.871 --> 01:34:15.871
<v Speaker 1>to his mother trying to explain to her </v>
<v Speaker 1>what apparently he's already tried to </v>

1538
01:34:15.871 --> 01:34:18.130
<v Speaker 1>explain to her before that this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1539
01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:20.590
<v Speaker 1>evil stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is modern warfaring.</v>

1540
01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like,</v>

1541
01:34:21.521 --> 01:34:23.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nights fighting a duel,</v>

1542
01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:27.370
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time the situation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than when nights fought duals.</v>

1543
01:34:27.610 --> 01:34:32.170
<v Speaker 1>People in the home front are no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent in modern warfare.</v>

1544
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:37.420
<v Speaker 1>They are the ones who make the weapons </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the soldiers require to fight.</v>

1545
01:34:37.450 --> 01:34:39.790
<v Speaker 1>If the soldiers can't breakthrough on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the western front,</v>

1546
01:34:39.791 --> 01:34:44.791
<v Speaker 1>what if you could prevent one side from </v>
<v Speaker 1>building the shells necessary to keep </v>

1547
01:34:44.791 --> 01:34:48.310
<v Speaker 1>the war going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where the idea of the home front</v>

1548
01:34:48.610 --> 01:34:53.610
<v Speaker 1>first really takes hold and it becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the justification for attacking </v>

1549
01:34:53.610 --> 01:34:56.440
<v Speaker 1>civilians in other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the letter that the german zeplin</v>

1550
01:34:56.441 --> 01:34:57.680
<v Speaker 1>leader Writes to his mother</v>

1551
01:34:58.100 --> 01:35:02.780
<v Speaker 5>trying to make his actions that he </v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently feels guilty over himself.</v>

1552
01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:04.760
<v Speaker 5>Sound morally okay.</v>

1553
01:35:06.890 --> 01:35:11.890
<v Speaker 5>We who strike the enemy where his heart </v>
<v Speaker 5>beats have been slandered as baby </v>

1554
01:35:11.890 --> 01:35:16.001
<v Speaker 5>killers and murderers of women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What we do is repugnant even to us,</v>

1555
01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:19.250
<v Speaker 5>but necessary very necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nowadays.</v>

1556
01:35:19.251 --> 01:35:21.500
<v Speaker 5>There's no such animal as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>noncombatant.</v>

1557
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:26.770
<v Speaker 5>Modern warfare is total warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A soldier cannot function at the front </v>

1558
01:35:26.770 --> 01:35:28.580
<v Speaker 5>without the factory worker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the farmer,</v>

1559
01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:31.370
<v Speaker 5>and all the other providers behind him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You will die.</v>

1560
01:35:31.371 --> 01:35:35.150
<v Speaker 5>Mother have discussed this subject and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>know you understand what I say.</v>

1561
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:39.110
<v Speaker 5>My man are brave and honorable there </v>
<v Speaker 5>causes holy.</v>

1562
01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:43.040
<v Speaker 5>How can they sin while doing their duty?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If what we do is frightful,</v>

1563
01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:47.090
<v Speaker 5>then may frightful be Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 5>salvation end Quote.</v>

1564
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:53.530
<v Speaker 5>This same attitude will be applied to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the other parts of warfare that rear </v>

1565
01:35:56.031 --> 01:36:01.010
<v Speaker 5>their ugly head in 1915 because of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>needs of the situation.</v>

1566
01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:06.040
<v Speaker 5>I mean flame throwers are one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>technological weapons that will first </v>

1567
01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:06.350
<v Speaker 5>appeared in 1915.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

1568
01:36:06.351 --> 01:36:10.820
<v Speaker 5>using science in ways to try to create </v>
<v Speaker 5>openings,</v>

1569
01:36:10.821 --> 01:36:14.810
<v Speaker 5>whether it taCtically on the battlefield</v>
<v Speaker 5>or strategically in the war itself.</v>

1570
01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:21.760
<v Speaker 5>Another perfect example of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when the first world war has to do with </v>

1571
01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:25.481
<v Speaker 5>anothEr one of these new weapons systems</v>
<v Speaker 5>that challenged age old theories and </v>

1572
01:36:26.361 --> 01:36:31.361
<v Speaker 5>orthodoxies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of them had to do with rules </v>

1573
01:36:31.361 --> 01:36:33.380
<v Speaker 5>concerning naval blockades.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see,</v>

1574
01:36:33.381 --> 01:36:38.381
<v Speaker 5>when the first world war breaks out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the british and the french navy </v>

1575
01:36:38.381 --> 01:36:39.530
<v Speaker 5>literally sweep the cs clean of german </v>
<v Speaker 5>shipping,</v>

1576
01:36:39.531 --> 01:36:44.531
<v Speaker 5>Both military and merchant shipping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>this sort of naval blockade was one of </v>

1577
01:36:45.021 --> 01:36:47.570
<v Speaker 5>the main things that britain could offer</v>
<v Speaker 5>early in the war.</v>

1578
01:36:47.571 --> 01:36:49.880
<v Speaker 5>They certainly weren't going to offer </v>
<v Speaker 5>millions and millions of troops.</v>

1579
01:36:49.881 --> 01:36:51.440
<v Speaker 5>They didn't have millions and millions </v>
<v Speaker 5>of troops.</v>

1580
01:36:51.441 --> 01:36:56.441
<v Speaker 5>They had the greatest navy in the world </v>
<v Speaker 5>and just like in napoleon's time when a </v>

1581
01:36:56.441 --> 01:36:59.810
<v Speaker 5>strong continental power takes hold,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you shut down their merchant shipping,</v>

1582
01:36:59.811 --> 01:37:04.811
<v Speaker 5>you close their porch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't allow them to get any </v>

1583
01:37:04.811 --> 01:37:04.811
<v Speaker 5>materials,</v>
<v Speaker 5>resources,</v>

1584
01:37:04.811 --> 01:37:05.030
<v Speaker 5>anything from anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you can help.</v>

1585
01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:08.300
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were international laws concerning</v>

1586
01:37:08.301 --> 01:37:10.970
<v Speaker 5>what you were allowed to keep from </v>
<v Speaker 5>combatants.</v>

1587
01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:14.990
<v Speaker 5>You weren't supposed to keep food stops </v>
<v Speaker 5>or the needs of everyday life.</v>

1588
01:37:14.991 --> 01:37:16.730
<v Speaker 5>You could keep weapons in those kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

1589
01:37:16.731 --> 01:37:21.731
<v Speaker 5>but the british and the french push </v>
<v Speaker 5>those rules way past the boundaries of </v>

1590
01:37:21.731 --> 01:37:25.061
<v Speaker 5>common sense and we're classifying </v>
<v Speaker 5>things like cotton fabrics is war </v>

1591
01:37:25.061 --> 01:37:29.861
<v Speaker 5>necessary materials.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They weren't really going to allow </v>

1592
01:37:29.861 --> 01:37:29.861
<v Speaker 5>anything through.</v>

1593
01:37:29.861 --> 01:37:32.750
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for all of human history,</v>

1594
01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:37.960
<v Speaker 5>there had been sort of a of a calculus </v>
<v Speaker 5>you could count on and that's the.</v>

1595
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000
<v Speaker 5>The weaker naval power cannot blockade </v>
<v Speaker 5>the stronger naval power by see,</v>

1596
01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:48.460
<v Speaker 5>how could you write your ships?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tried to blockade a country like great </v>

1597
01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:52.091
<v Speaker 5>britain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll just send their navy out and </v>

1598
01:37:52.091 --> 01:37:52.940
<v Speaker 5>sweep your ships off the sea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what if your ships aren't on the c?</v>

1599
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:58.750
<v Speaker 5>What if the ships that are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>blockade an island nation like britain </v>

1600
01:37:58.750 --> 01:38:02.751
<v Speaker 5>or instead under the sea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the germans had some marines,</v>

1601
01:38:04.320 --> 01:38:08.040
<v Speaker 5>this was not a brand new invention,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but one that had finally reached a stage</v>

1602
01:38:08.041 --> 01:38:13.041
<v Speaker 5>of effectiveness where the british were </v>
<v Speaker 5>to find out that the old naval </v>

1603
01:38:13.051 --> 01:38:18.051
<v Speaker 5>orthodoxies about what a weaker naval </v>
<v Speaker 5>power could and couldn't do had changed.</v>

1604
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:23.760
<v Speaker 5>There was no answer at this point in </v>
<v Speaker 5>history to the submarine surface.</v>

1605
01:38:23.761 --> 01:38:27.570
<v Speaker 5>Vessels could not detect them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and unless the submarine surfaced,</v>

1606
01:38:27.690 --> 01:38:28.680
<v Speaker 5>they couldn't destroy them.</v>

1607
01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:34.520
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Germany had a lot less submarines than </v>

1608
01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:34.520
<v Speaker 5>britain and France,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but here's the thing.</v>

1609
01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:36.030
<v Speaker 5>Britain and France couldn't do anything </v>
<v Speaker 5>with their submarines.</v>

1610
01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:40.140
<v Speaker 5>They couldn't use their submarines </v>
<v Speaker 5>against german merchant shipping because</v>

1611
01:38:40.141 --> 01:38:42.060
<v Speaker 5>there wasn't any german merchant </v>
<v Speaker 5>shipping.</v>

1612
01:38:42.061 --> 01:38:43.920
<v Speaker 5>About five minutes after the war breaks </v>
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>

1613
01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:46.890
<v Speaker 5>the surface fleets of France and britain</v>
<v Speaker 5>saw to that,</v>

1614
01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:52.820
<v Speaker 5>but germany's surface fleet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was one of the things that had </v>

1615
01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:56.180
<v Speaker 5>precipitated the war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the many causes that's always </v>

1616
01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:58.761
<v Speaker 5>cited as the naval arms race between </v>
<v Speaker 5>britain and Germany stayed in port.</v>

1617
01:38:58.891 --> 01:39:03.891
<v Speaker 5>For the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Neither british nor the germans were </v>

1618
01:39:03.891 --> 01:39:06.921
<v Speaker 5>willing to risk these enormously </v>
<v Speaker 5>expensive and hard to replace surface </v>

1619
01:39:07.801 --> 01:39:10.440
<v Speaker 5>ships that were the what are called </v>
<v Speaker 5>capital ships,</v>

1620
01:39:10.441 --> 01:39:15.441
<v Speaker 5>battleships,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the really unbelievably expensive </v>

1621
01:39:15.441 --> 01:39:15.441
<v Speaker 5>lenses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

1622
01:39:15.441 --> 01:39:17.580
<v Speaker 5>the british had just commissioned to </v>
<v Speaker 5>class ships known as the queen elizabeth</v>

1623
01:39:17.581 --> 01:39:22.581
<v Speaker 5>class of battleships,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which were so good in the first world </v>

1624
01:39:22.581 --> 01:39:22.581
<v Speaker 5>war.</v>

1625
01:39:22.581 --> 01:39:23.130
<v Speaker 5>They'd still be very effective units in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the second world war,</v>

1626
01:39:23.670 --> 01:39:28.170
<v Speaker 5>but if a cheap little submarine could </v>
<v Speaker 5>sink one of those ships with a torpedo,</v>

1627
01:39:28.950 --> 01:39:32.250
<v Speaker 5>that's nothing that any naval commanders</v>
<v Speaker 5>were willing to risk,</v>

1628
01:39:32.251 --> 01:39:37.251
<v Speaker 5>and so all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's being so careful with their </v>

1629
01:39:37.251 --> 01:39:38.610
<v Speaker 5>big ships that it leaves openings for </v>
<v Speaker 5>the little ships to make a difference.</v>

1630
01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:44.540
<v Speaker 5>Everyone thought at the beginning of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>war that these submarines would be used </v>

1631
01:39:44.540 --> 01:39:48.111
<v Speaker 5>in the military sense against other </v>
<v Speaker 5>warships by february 19 slash 15.</v>

1632
01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:54.020
<v Speaker 5>The germans are now using them against </v>
<v Speaker 5>merchant shipping and all of a sudden </v>

1633
01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:57.591
<v Speaker 5>the greatest navy in the world finds </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they can't defend their merchant </v>

1634
01:39:57.591 --> 01:39:58.680
<v Speaker 5>shipping because of a new technological </v>
<v Speaker 5>creation.</v>

1635
01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:03.860
<v Speaker 5>We're weAker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Naval power has the potential to turn </v>

1636
01:40:03.860 --> 01:40:06.921
<v Speaker 5>the tables on the best weapon that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>great naval powers have blockading </v>

1637
01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:12.800
<v Speaker 5>weaker naval powers and the british who </v>
<v Speaker 5>are doing a very good job of keeping </v>

1638
01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:17.271
<v Speaker 5>goods and weapons from flowing into </v>
<v Speaker 5>Germany by sea are finding out that the </v>

1639
01:40:17.271 --> 01:40:19.440
<v Speaker 5>germans had the capability to do the </v>
<v Speaker 5>same thing back to them.</v>

1640
01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:24.630
<v Speaker 5>Now the big issue will surface,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you'll pardon the pun,</v>

1641
01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:30.080
<v Speaker 5>around whether or not the warfare should</v>
<v Speaker 5>follow the old famous rules of the ce or</v>

1642
01:40:31.141 --> 01:40:36.141
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The old famous rules of the c word that </v>

1643
01:40:36.141 --> 01:40:37.030
<v Speaker 5>you didn't destroy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1644
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:42.210
<v Speaker 5>merchant shipping nonmilitary vessels </v>
<v Speaker 5>without letting them know that's piracy.</v>

1645
01:40:42.570 --> 01:40:45.870
<v Speaker 5>You basically are supposed to give them </v>
<v Speaker 5>a message and say,</v>

1646
01:40:45.871 --> 01:40:50.871
<v Speaker 5>we're seizing your ship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let them take their people off the ship </v>

1647
01:40:50.871 --> 01:40:53.961
<v Speaker 5>on lifeboats and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you can either sink the vessel </v>

1648
01:40:53.961 --> 01:40:55.480
<v Speaker 5>that you were after or you can take it </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a prize and Capture it.</v>

1649
01:40:56.020 --> 01:40:58.690
<v Speaker 5>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when the submarines tried to do this,</v>

1650
01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:03.010
<v Speaker 5>it opened them up to being destroyed and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the british played this up.</v>

1651
01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:05.110
<v Speaker 5>They started putting guns on all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>merchant ships.</v>

1652
01:41:05.410 --> 01:41:08.350
<v Speaker 5>So if the germans came up and did what </v>
<v Speaker 5>they were supposed to do,</v>

1653
01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:11.560
<v Speaker 5>tell the merchant ship were captured </v>
<v Speaker 5>your prize of war.</v>

1654
01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:16.560
<v Speaker 5>Now get your life boats out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get your people off the ship and we'll </v>

1655
01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:19.321
<v Speaker 5>sync it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'd often pull the canvas off a gun </v>

1656
01:41:19.321 --> 01:41:20.410
<v Speaker 5>and starts shooting at the now </v>
<v Speaker 5>vulnerable submarine because it had,</v>

1657
01:41:20.411 --> 01:41:23.920
<v Speaker 5>had to surface in order to comply with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the international laws of war,</v>

1658
01:41:23.921 --> 01:41:28.921
<v Speaker 5>right to the germans were having these </v>
<v Speaker 5>debates in 1915 about whether or not </v>

1659
01:41:29.861 --> 01:41:34.861
<v Speaker 5>they should do that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they should just sink these </v>

1660
01:41:34.861 --> 01:41:36.880
<v Speaker 5>vessels without surfacing or warning </v>
<v Speaker 5>them or anything.</v>

1661
01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:39.670
<v Speaker 5>But this again would look like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>germans were,</v>

1662
01:41:40.100 --> 01:41:45.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ones outside international law were </v>

1663
01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:47.200
<v Speaker 5>the ones who were the bad guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And worse than that,</v>

1664
01:41:47.650 --> 01:41:52.650
<v Speaker 5>they risked alienating neutral powers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The most important of which was the </v>

1665
01:41:52.650 --> 01:41:53.560
<v Speaker 5>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was a very,</v>

1666
01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:56.860
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>know maritime power,</v>

1667
01:41:57.070 --> 01:41:59.470
<v Speaker 5>huge into trade.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

1668
01:41:59.471 --> 01:42:04.471
<v Speaker 5>at this point in the war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you wanted to say who's gaining from </v>

1669
01:42:04.471 --> 01:42:07.501
<v Speaker 5>the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the United States because one of </v>

1670
01:42:07.501 --> 01:42:10.951
<v Speaker 5>the things that all these powers do when</v>
<v Speaker 5>they find out they can't produce enough </v>

1671
01:42:10.951 --> 01:42:12.430
<v Speaker 5>shells and weapons and war materials to </v>
<v Speaker 5>keep the war going,</v>

1672
01:42:12.910 --> 01:42:17.910
<v Speaker 5>is borrow money from the United States </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then turn around and spend that </v>

1673
01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:21.571
<v Speaker 5>borrowed money on stuff and production </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the United States often called the </v>

1674
01:42:22.331 --> 01:42:23.230
<v Speaker 5>great neutral.</v>

1675
01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:28.620
<v Speaker 5>The United States just wants to be able </v>
<v Speaker 5>to keep delivering their stuff where it </v>

1676
01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:31.891
<v Speaker 5>has to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're already getting tense with the </v>

1677
01:42:31.891 --> 01:42:31.891
<v Speaker 5>british,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1678
01:42:31.891 --> 01:42:33.470
<v Speaker 5>searching their ships and saying that </v>
<v Speaker 5>this shipper,</v>

1679
01:42:33.490 --> 01:42:35.440
<v Speaker 5>that ship can dock at this porter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that port.</v>

1680
01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:38.890
<v Speaker 5>But when the germans start sinking </v>
<v Speaker 5>merchant vessels,</v>

1681
01:42:39.130 --> 01:42:42.220
<v Speaker 5>sometimes those merchant vessels have </v>
<v Speaker 5>americans on them.</v>

1682
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:47.790
<v Speaker 5>In early 1915,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of those vessels was called the </v>

1683
01:42:47.790 --> 01:42:48.250
<v Speaker 5>lusitania.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The lusitania,</v>

1684
01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:50.170
<v Speaker 5>if you want to think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1685
01:42:50.171 --> 01:42:54.700
<v Speaker 5>to conceptualize what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about here is very much like the titanic</v>

1686
01:42:55.030 --> 01:42:59.140
<v Speaker 5>and extremely large ocean liner,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a passenger ship.</v>

1687
01:42:59.170 --> 01:43:01.210
<v Speaker 5>This is how people got from the old </v>
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>

1688
01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:06.250
<v Speaker 5>the new world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and back again across the atlantic in </v>

1689
01:43:06.250 --> 01:43:06.250
<v Speaker 5>the days before transatlantic air </v>
<v Speaker 5>flight.</v>

1690
01:43:06.820 --> 01:43:11.820
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>controversy has raged ever since the </v>

1691
01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:14.380
<v Speaker 5>german submarine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which opened fire on the lusitania,</v>

1692
01:43:14.381 --> 01:43:18.430
<v Speaker 5>sank that ship on whether or not he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>a legitimate target of war.</v>

1693
01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:20.890
<v Speaker 5>They did have munitions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it did,</v>

1694
01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:24.560
<v Speaker 5>supposedly they could sync it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of evidence that suggested</v>

1695
01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:29.580
<v Speaker 5>did and some conspiracy theories out </v>
<v Speaker 5>there that suggests that people like </v>

1696
01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:33.361
<v Speaker 5>winston churchill assured that it did so</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it would be another nail in the </v>

1697
01:43:33.611 --> 01:43:38.611
<v Speaker 5>coffin he was starting to construct that</v>
<v Speaker 5>would eventually get the United States </v>

1698
01:43:38.611 --> 01:43:41.911
<v Speaker 5>into the war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>More than 100 americans were on the </v>

1699
01:43:41.911 --> 01:43:43.921
<v Speaker 5>lusitania and died when it went down at </v>
<v Speaker 5>various times in the war,</v>

1700
01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:49.180
<v Speaker 5>the germans would start up what was </v>
<v Speaker 5>called unrestricted submarine warfare,</v>

1701
01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:54.420
<v Speaker 5>where they shot at anything that looked </v>
<v Speaker 5>like enemy ship of any kind and other </v>

1702
01:43:54.420 --> 01:43:57.020
<v Speaker 5>times where they would stop because </v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a huge debate within the halls</v>

1703
01:43:57.021 --> 01:44:02.021
<v Speaker 5>of german leadership over whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 5>they gained more or last more when they </v>

1704
01:44:02.021 --> 01:44:03.890
<v Speaker 5>did this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If the United States comes into the war,</v>

1705
01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:08.980
<v Speaker 5>it's a huge loss,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's one of the few ways that in </v>

1706
01:44:08.980 --> 01:44:12.341
<v Speaker 5>1915 they can see that they can bring </v>
<v Speaker 5>britain to its knees.</v>

1707
01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:18.070
<v Speaker 5>They can starve that island in ways that</v>
<v Speaker 5>the british never could have imagined </v>

1708
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:22.361
<v Speaker 5>before the war because before the war </v>
<v Speaker 5>they thought you had to have a bigger </v>

1709
01:44:22.361 --> 01:44:25.781
<v Speaker 5>navy to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Technology had turned the tables on the </v>

1710
01:44:25.781 --> 01:44:26.510
<v Speaker 5>greatest naval power in history.</v>

1711
01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:33.580
<v Speaker 5>The perhaps the most iconic asymmetrical</v>
<v Speaker 5>warfare of this period has to do with </v>

1712
01:44:36.051 --> 01:44:38.300
<v Speaker 5>something that was a big worry at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hague.</v>

1713
01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:41.180
<v Speaker 5>Conferences in the late 18 hundreds and </v>
<v Speaker 5>early 19 hundreds.</v>

1714
01:44:42.110 --> 01:44:47.110
<v Speaker 5>Something that shows the desperation of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the germans at this stage in the war </v>

1715
01:44:47.421 --> 01:44:52.421
<v Speaker 5>that they would resort to this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It involves the use of what the hague </v>

1716
01:44:52.421 --> 01:44:56.030
<v Speaker 5>conference called asphyxiating gases.</v>

1717
01:44:57.920 --> 01:45:02.920
<v Speaker 5>Everyone had realized by the late 18 </v>
<v Speaker 5>hundreds that the modern chemical </v>

1718
01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:04.550
<v Speaker 5>industry is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We would recognize it today,</v>

1719
01:45:04.551 --> 01:45:09.551
<v Speaker 5>had come of age mean there were all </v>
<v Speaker 5>sorts of explosive gunpowders and </v>

1720
01:45:09.551 --> 01:45:13.631
<v Speaker 5>everything that we're so much more </v>
<v Speaker 5>explosive than had been the case in </v>

1721
01:45:13.631 --> 01:45:15.950
<v Speaker 5>napoleon's time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>less than a century beforehand.</v>

1722
01:45:15.951 --> 01:45:18.050
<v Speaker 5>So everyone was aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibilities,</v>

1723
01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:23.590
<v Speaker 5>but gunpowder and explosives were just </v>
<v Speaker 5>more powerful versions of weapons that </v>

1724
01:45:23.590 --> 01:45:27.941
<v Speaker 5>had been used for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The chemical industry made possible the </v>

1725
01:45:27.941 --> 01:45:30.740
<v Speaker 5>use of weapons that had never been used </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that no one knew.</v>

1726
01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:33.140
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the effects if they were used,</v>

1727
01:45:33.141 --> 01:45:38.141
<v Speaker 5>would be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so with the hague conference in </v>

1728
01:45:38.141 --> 01:45:38.141
<v Speaker 5>1899,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the issue was addressed.</v>

1729
01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:43.520
<v Speaker 5>The conference outlawed the use of </v>
<v Speaker 5>poison or poisoned weapons,</v>

1730
01:45:43.790 --> 01:45:48.790
<v Speaker 5>arms projectiles or material calculated </v>
<v Speaker 5>to cause unnecessary suffering and </v>

1731
01:45:49.971 --> 01:45:54.971
<v Speaker 5>projectiles designed for the diffusion </v>
<v Speaker 5>of is fixating or deleterious gases and </v>

1732
01:45:55.200 --> 01:45:58.520
<v Speaker 5>to quote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But in 1915,</v>

1733
01:45:58.860 --> 01:46:03.860
<v Speaker 5>Germany is looking at all these laws of </v>
<v Speaker 5>war through a completely different lens </v>

1734
01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:08.770
<v Speaker 5>as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tradeoff between follow </v>

1735
01:46:08.770 --> 01:46:08.770
<v Speaker 5>international law or lose the war.</v>

1736
01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:12.020
<v Speaker 5>What's more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're dealing with this front.</v>

1737
01:46:12.021 --> 01:46:15.920
<v Speaker 5>As we sat on the western front that had </v>
<v Speaker 5>solidified in interesting ways.</v>

1738
01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:19.010
<v Speaker 5>As we said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a continuous trench system from</v>

1739
01:46:19.011 --> 01:46:22.880
<v Speaker 5>the swiss border all the way you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>up to the ocean.</v>

1740
01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:28.810
<v Speaker 5>And the interesting part is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that territory is not really good </v>

1741
01:46:29.001 --> 01:46:31.970
<v Speaker 5>fighting ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of it's to marshy.</v>

1742
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:37.000
<v Speaker 5>A lot of it's to forest did a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The germans are in such an amazingly </v>

1743
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.570
<v Speaker 5>strong position.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd be an idiot to challenge them,</v>

1744
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:43.870
<v Speaker 5>which leaves the same few spots as good </v>
<v Speaker 5>areas to launch offensive,</v>

1745
01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:46.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>campaigns,</v>

1746
01:46:46.610 --> 01:46:51.610
<v Speaker 5>which means that those areas become the </v>
<v Speaker 5>most horrific battlefields in human </v>

1747
01:46:51.931 --> 01:46:56.931
<v Speaker 5>history because they basically don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>move very much for the entire war and </v>

1748
01:46:57.600 --> 01:47:02.600
<v Speaker 5>the same ground is plowed up by </v>
<v Speaker 5>artillery shells over and over again.</v>

1749
01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:08.420
<v Speaker 5>The people that die in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of these places are never buried </v>

1750
01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:12.950
<v Speaker 5>and so you have a charnel house of </v>
<v Speaker 5>horrors of people who have just been </v>

1751
01:47:13.531 --> 01:47:14.490
<v Speaker 5>killed the other day.</v>

1752
01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:17.550
<v Speaker 5>People that were killed a month ago,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that were killed a year ago,</v>

1753
01:47:17.610 --> 01:47:21.750
<v Speaker 5>all in the same spot and you as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>soldier have to live in this environment</v>

1754
01:47:22.710 --> 01:47:25.530
<v Speaker 5>and that of course ignores the more </v>
<v Speaker 5>mundane aspects,</v>

1755
01:47:25.531 --> 01:47:30.150
<v Speaker 5>which is if you are trapped in a trench </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you can't move without being shot,</v>

1756
01:47:30.840 --> 01:47:34.230
<v Speaker 5>where do you go to the bathroom?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean early on in the combat,</v>

1757
01:47:34.530 --> 01:47:39.530
<v Speaker 5>british soldiers were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>taking the german helmets with the </v>

1758
01:47:39.530 --> 01:47:41.760
<v Speaker 5>spikes on them as souvenirs for the war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but quickly realized that the best thing</v>

1759
01:47:41.761 --> 01:47:46.761
<v Speaker 5>you could do with those things is used </v>
<v Speaker 5>them as a receptacle for the call of </v>

1760
01:47:46.761 --> 01:47:51.201
<v Speaker 5>nature and then toss it as far away from</v>
<v Speaker 5>the trenches possible so that the smell </v>

1761
01:47:51.201 --> 01:47:54.921
<v Speaker 5>of thousands of men doing this in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>confined space over years doesn't </v>

1762
01:47:55.531 --> 01:47:56.610
<v Speaker 5>overwhelm you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As We said,</v>

1763
01:47:56.611 --> 01:48:01.611
<v Speaker 5>certain battlegrounds like ipa will </v>
<v Speaker 5>become famous for their smell and you </v>

1764
01:48:01.611 --> 01:48:03.900
<v Speaker 5>will be able to smell them before you </v>
<v Speaker 5>get anywhere near them.</v>

1765
01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:09.920
<v Speaker 5>The canadians are arrivinG in early 1915</v>
<v Speaker 5>in numbers and they take over some of </v>

1766
01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:14.640
<v Speaker 5>these battlefields.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know where nothing has changed.</v>

1767
01:48:14.641 --> 01:48:17.070
<v Speaker 5>I mean no one's gone out and buried </v>
<v Speaker 5>anybody.</v>

1768
01:48:17.071 --> 01:48:18.240
<v Speaker 5>That was one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

1769
01:48:18.241 --> 01:48:23.241
<v Speaker 5>during the christmas truce is that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>talked about that was the number one </v>

1770
01:48:23.241 --> 01:48:27.111
<v Speaker 5>thing both sides tried to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which tells you how crazy the smell and </v>

1771
01:48:27.111 --> 01:48:27.690
<v Speaker 5>the situation and now horrifying it must</v>
<v Speaker 5>have been,</v>

1772
01:48:27.691 --> 01:48:32.691
<v Speaker 5>but they jump out of these trenches and </v>
<v Speaker 5>start to try to bury these bodies that </v>

1773
01:48:32.691 --> 01:48:36.221
<v Speaker 5>have been out there for months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Canadian soldier on the western front </v>

1774
01:48:36.221 --> 01:48:40.470
<v Speaker 5>arriving at the trenches of eat in early</v>
<v Speaker 5>1915 trenches that had been occupied by </v>

1775
01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:46.380
<v Speaker 5>the grca forces from around India and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>canadian sergeant name sv britain </v>

1776
01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:50.610
<v Speaker 5>describes his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1777
01:48:50.611 --> 01:48:55.410
<v Speaker 5>welcome to the western front in suitably</v>
<v Speaker 5>horrific terms.</v>

1778
01:48:55.950 --> 01:48:56.910
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

1779
01:48:58.050 --> 01:49:03.050
<v Speaker 5>left at 6:30</v>
<v Speaker 5>PM for reserve trenches and reached our </v>

1780
01:49:03.050 --> 01:49:05.880
<v Speaker 5>reserved dugouts via st julian just rat </v>
<v Speaker 5>holes.</v>

1781
01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:11.000
<v Speaker 5>One hell of an accommodation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Got to the trenches as a fatigue party </v>

1782
01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.220
<v Speaker 5>with steak and sandbags,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and though there were reserved trenches,</v>

1783
01:49:14.430 --> 01:49:17.670
<v Speaker 5>they were so rotten.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No trenches at all in parts,</v>

1784
01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:22.700
<v Speaker 5>just isolated mounds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>found germans feet sticking up through </v>

1785
01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:27.111
<v Speaker 5>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The gurkhas had actually used human </v>

1786
01:49:27.111 --> 01:49:29.400
<v Speaker 5>bodies instead of sandbags right beside </v>
<v Speaker 5>the stream where we were working,</v>

1787
01:49:29.610 --> 01:49:33.300
<v Speaker 5>where the bodies of two dead since </v>
<v Speaker 5>november last one,</v>

1788
01:49:33.301 --> 01:49:36.930
<v Speaker 5>face downward in full marching order </v>
<v Speaker 5>with this kit on his back.</v>

1789
01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:41.960
<v Speaker 5>He died game stench,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something awful and dead all around </v>

1790
01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:46.820
<v Speaker 5>water rats had made a home of their </v>
<v Speaker 5>decomposed bodies visiting the barb wire</v>

1791
01:49:46.891 --> 01:49:50.050
<v Speaker 5>with ray,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ordinary wire strung across,</v>

1792
01:49:50.380 --> 01:49:51.910
<v Speaker 5>quit about 1:00</v>
<v Speaker 5>AM,</v>

1793
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.730
<v Speaker 5>came back to our dugouts and found them </v>
<v Speaker 5>on fire.</v>

1794
01:49:54.970 --> 01:49:58.900
<v Speaker 5>Had to march out to st julien and put up</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a roofless house,</v>

1795
01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:01.690
<v Speaker 5>not a roof left on anything in the whole</v>
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>

1796
01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:05.260
<v Speaker 5>Found our sack of food had been stolen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we were famished.</v>

1797
01:50:05.590 --> 01:50:10.590
<v Speaker 5>Certainly a most unlucky day for I lost </v>
<v Speaker 5>my cherished pipe bed at 4:00</v>

1798
01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:12.010
<v Speaker 5>AM and quote,</v>

1799
01:50:13.970 --> 01:50:15.950
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if the canadians thought the battlefield</v>

1800
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:20.450
<v Speaker 5>and the traditional aspects of what war </v>
<v Speaker 5>had already come to be by that time were</v>

1801
01:50:20.451 --> 01:50:25.451
<v Speaker 5>as bad as it was going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were frightfully mistaken for at </v>

1802
01:50:25.451 --> 01:50:25.451
<v Speaker 5>this battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That will be called.</v>

1803
01:50:25.451 --> 01:50:30.251
<v Speaker 5>The second battle of ipa is the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>time that a major gas attack happens and</v>

1804
01:50:32.541 --> 01:50:37.541
<v Speaker 5>the canadians will be the reason that it</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't turn out to be a huge tragedy </v>

1805
01:50:38.031 --> 01:50:43.031
<v Speaker 5>for the allied cause.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The other reason will be that the </v>

1806
01:50:43.031 --> 01:50:45.320
<v Speaker 5>germans had no idea that their attack </v>
<v Speaker 5>was going to be this successful and this</v>

1807
01:50:45.321 --> 01:50:48.050
<v Speaker 5>becomes a pattern with all this new </v>
<v Speaker 5>technology.</v>

1808
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:53.470
<v Speaker 5>Very often the commanders are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>figure out whether this new technology </v>

1809
01:50:53.861 --> 01:50:55.970
<v Speaker 5>is going to be something that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>effective and useful,</v>

1810
01:50:56.150 --> 01:51:00.080
<v Speaker 5>so they try it out on a small scale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not really expecting to make good use of</v>

1811
01:51:00.081 --> 01:51:03.500
<v Speaker 5>it and because of the sheer shock of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>new stuff,</v>

1812
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:09.070
<v Speaker 5>it proves wonderfully effective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it can't be exploited because the </v>

1813
01:51:09.070 --> 01:51:11.830
<v Speaker 5>generals who authorized it's use hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>planned to explore it.</v>

1814
01:51:11.831 --> 01:51:14.420
<v Speaker 5>If they were hoping to test it out a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little bit and then if it was good,</v>

1815
01:51:14.421 --> 01:51:17.750
<v Speaker 5>they'll use it later,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but by the time later Comes around,</v>

1816
01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:20.210
<v Speaker 5>the other side has figured out </v>
<v Speaker 5>countermeasurEs.</v>

1817
01:51:20.450 --> 01:51:24.860
<v Speaker 5>Gas worked exactly like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then before it was used,</v>

1818
01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:28.280
<v Speaker 5>the german high command,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just as they did with submarine warfare,</v>

1819
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:31.040
<v Speaker 5>debated whether or not this was a good </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing intensely.</v>

1820
01:51:33.010 --> 01:51:36.220
<v Speaker 5>As we said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were all these laws that the hague</v>

1821
01:51:36.221 --> 01:51:38.650
<v Speaker 5>conference had sat down saying you </v>
<v Speaker 5>couldn't use this stuff,</v>

1822
01:51:39.340 --> 01:51:41.890
<v Speaker 5>and some of the german leaders had said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we sign these papers,</v>

1823
01:51:41.891 --> 01:51:44.860
<v Speaker 5>and others had found little loopholes </v>
<v Speaker 5>like legal loopholes that said,</v>

1824
01:51:44.861 --> 01:51:46.630
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it said we couldn't use shovels,</v>

1825
01:51:46.631 --> 01:51:50.320
<v Speaker 5>but nothing said anything about just </v>
<v Speaker 5>taking the lids off of,</v>

1826
01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:55.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>containers that had chlorine gas in </v>

1827
01:51:55.580 --> 01:51:55.580
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1828
01:51:56.250 --> 01:52:01.250
<v Speaker 5>Historian eric dorm burroughs writes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote the same kind of murderously cold </v>

1829
01:52:01.651 --> 01:52:06.651
<v Speaker 5>war time mentality that would terminate </v>
<v Speaker 5>1200 civilians aboard the lusitania two </v>

1830
01:52:06.841 --> 01:52:09.330
<v Speaker 5>weeks later did not allow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>However,</v>

1831
01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:14.480
<v Speaker 5>for respect of international law,</v>
<v Speaker 5>german legal experts advised general </v>

1832
01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:19.101
<v Speaker 5>falcon hein,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the attack could be justified </v>

1833
01:52:19.101 --> 01:52:19.101
<v Speaker 5>because the gas was released from </v>
<v Speaker 5>containers.</v>

1834
01:52:19.110 --> 01:52:24.110
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just to save artillery shells and not </v>

1835
01:52:24.110 --> 01:52:24.750
<v Speaker 5>from projectiles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>On the other side of the debate,</v>

1836
01:52:25.020 --> 01:52:30.020
<v Speaker 5>duke albert avert and commander of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sixth army argued that unleashing this </v>

1837
01:52:30.020 --> 01:52:34.170
<v Speaker 5>new weapon would not only be a moral but</v>
<v Speaker 5>also with dubious military value.</v>

1838
01:52:34.350 --> 01:52:39.350
<v Speaker 5>For the allies with the wind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>normally at their backs would probably </v>

1839
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:41.490
<v Speaker 5>send 10 times as much gas onto german </v>
<v Speaker 5>positions.</v>

1840
01:52:41.790 --> 01:52:46.790
<v Speaker 5>Karl von item of the third army agreed </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then additional worries over the </v>

1841
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:51.641
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tremendous scandal and quote that would </v>

1842
01:52:51.641 --> 01:52:52.550
<v Speaker 5>compromise in disgrace Germany in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>eyes of the world.</v>

1843
01:52:53.470 --> 01:52:56.150
<v Speaker 5>War haS nothing to do with chivalry </v>
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

1844
01:52:56.151 --> 01:52:58.820
<v Speaker 5>He wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the higher civilization rises,</v>

1845
01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:04.000
<v Speaker 5>the more vile man becomes and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if anybody still had any of those old </v>

1846
01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:11.120
<v Speaker 5>19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 5>truly going back to ancient times,</v>

1847
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:16.490
<v Speaker 5>versions of the romantic glorious,</v>
<v Speaker 5>heroic dual that they had been raised to</v>

1848
01:53:16.491 --> 01:53:21.491
<v Speaker 5>believe that war was operation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Disinfectant will cure them of such </v>

1849
01:53:23.810 --> 01:53:28.810
<v Speaker 5>ills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That will be the german name for the </v>

1850
01:53:28.810 --> 01:53:31.481
<v Speaker 5>program and the code word to start the </v>
<v Speaker 5>operation will be god punish england.</v>

1851
01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:39.760
<v Speaker 5>The operation involves almost 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>cylinders containing chlorine gas,</v>

1852
01:53:41.121 --> 01:53:46.121
<v Speaker 5>a byproduct of the German dye </v>
<v Speaker 5>manufacturing industry that the germans </v>

1853
01:53:46.121 --> 01:53:47.360
<v Speaker 5>had planted in the soil carefully over </v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

1854
01:53:47.361 --> 01:53:51.260
<v Speaker 5>around the battlefield that ether in </v>
<v Speaker 5>August,</v>

1855
01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:56.260
<v Speaker 5>1915,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they took the tops off the containers </v>

1856
01:53:56.260 --> 01:53:58.780
<v Speaker 5>when the wind was right and let the </v>
<v Speaker 5>chlorine gas blow across the battlefield</v>

1857
01:53:59.481 --> 01:54:04.481
<v Speaker 5>toward the allied trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which were occupied by french algerian </v>

1858
01:54:04.701 --> 01:54:08.030
<v Speaker 5>forces which involve both french troops </v>
<v Speaker 5>and Algeria and troops,</v>

1859
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:11.510
<v Speaker 5>and also the newly arrived canadian </v>
<v Speaker 5>forces.</v>

1860
01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:17.440
<v Speaker 5>They didn't know what to make of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they figured out pretty quickly it </v>

1861
01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:22.121
<v Speaker 5>was hell on earth as one indian soldier </v>
<v Speaker 5>would write his father afterwards.</v>

1862
01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:25.880
<v Speaker 5>This isn't war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the end of the world.</v>

1863
01:54:26.930 --> 01:54:31.930
<v Speaker 5>The end of the world to some of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people at the second battle of ipa </v>

1864
01:54:31.930 --> 01:54:36.580
<v Speaker 5>looked like a cloud of greenish yellow </v>
<v Speaker 5>gas that was floating across the </v>

1865
01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:40.460
<v Speaker 5>battlefield so slowly you could actually</v>
<v Speaker 5>walk ahead of it,</v>

1866
01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:43.640
<v Speaker 5>but because these soldiers didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 5>what they were looking at,</v>

1867
01:54:43.641 --> 01:54:46.310
<v Speaker 5>most of them didn't move until it hit </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

1868
01:54:47.810 --> 01:54:50.480
<v Speaker 5>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Historian eric dorn bros quote,</v>

1869
01:54:51.520 --> 01:54:56.520
<v Speaker 5>stretching 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>meters along opposing lines and </v>

1870
01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:57.520
<v Speaker 5>bellowing high up into the air.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A thick,</v>

1871
01:54:57.550 --> 01:55:02.550
<v Speaker 5>ghastly looking green.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yellow cloud of gas moved eerily and </v>

1872
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:04.150
<v Speaker 5>threateningly with the breeze across no </v>
<v Speaker 5>man's land.</v>

1873
01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:08.380
<v Speaker 5>The gassiest monstrosity took on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>pinkish hue from certain angles.</v>

1874
01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:11.260
<v Speaker 5>As the descending western sun shone </v>
<v Speaker 5>through it.</v>

1875
01:55:11.650 --> 01:55:16.090
<v Speaker 5>To compound the shock and terror,</v>
<v Speaker 5>german heavy artillery began to lay down</v>

1876
01:55:16.091 --> 01:55:19.600
<v Speaker 5>a pounding barrage to french colonial </v>
<v Speaker 5>divisions.</v>

1877
01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:22.780
<v Speaker 5>And a canadian division were caught </v>
<v Speaker 5>completely unaware.</v>

1878
01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:24.650
<v Speaker 5>Quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take a look at this.</v>

1879
01:55:24.651 --> 01:55:29.651
<v Speaker 5>Sir said one canadian artillery observer</v>
<v Speaker 5>to his superior as he stared through </v>

1880
01:55:29.651 --> 01:55:30.970
<v Speaker 5>binoculars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was coming towards them.</v>

1881
01:55:31.330 --> 01:55:36.330
<v Speaker 5>There's something funny going on when he</v>
<v Speaker 5>dove for cover from the incoming shells,</v>

1882
01:55:36.930 --> 01:55:41.930
<v Speaker 5>but just then the wind shifted </v>
<v Speaker 5>compressing the gas cloud over the </v>

1883
01:55:41.930 --> 01:55:45.450
<v Speaker 5>algerian who's forward units were the </v>
<v Speaker 5>soldiers grabbed their throats,</v>

1884
01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:50.660
<v Speaker 5>choking and riding in excruciating pain </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the searing chlorine gas in </v>

1885
01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:55.431
<v Speaker 5>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Many hundreds laid drowning in fluids </v>

1886
01:55:55.431 --> 01:55:57.060
<v Speaker 5>given off by the lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seeing this others panicked,</v>

1887
01:55:57.300 --> 01:56:02.300
<v Speaker 5>drop their rifles and ran,</v>
<v Speaker 5>leaving a six kilometer gap in the line </v>

1888
01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:07.130
<v Speaker 5>and quote private william quintin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a british soldier experience his first </v>

1889
01:56:10.071 --> 01:56:14.210
<v Speaker 5>gas attack only about a week after the </v>
<v Speaker 5>first time it had been used.</v>

1890
01:56:14.810 --> 01:56:16.760
<v Speaker 5>That affair had caused</v>

1891
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:22.750
<v Speaker 5>the high command to tell the troops to </v>
<v Speaker 5>soak flannel in water and just put it </v>

1892
01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:27.641
<v Speaker 5>over their noses is a cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 5>easy attempt to try to forestall the </v>

1893
01:56:27.641 --> 01:56:31.871
<v Speaker 5>gas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But none of these soldiers knew what </v>

1894
01:56:31.871 --> 01:56:31.871
<v Speaker 5>they were facing until they actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1895
01:56:31.871 --> 01:56:35.840
<v Speaker 5>had a gas attack hit them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which quintin had hit him on May 1st 19,</v>

1896
01:56:35.841 --> 01:56:39.350
<v Speaker 5>15 quote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Suddenly over the top of our front line,</v>

1897
01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:44.620
<v Speaker 5>we saw what looked like clouds of thin </v>
<v Speaker 5>gray smoke rolling slowly along with a </v>

1898
01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:45.700
<v Speaker 5>slight wind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It hung,</v>

1899
01:56:45.701 --> 01:56:50.701
<v Speaker 5>did the ground reaching to the height of</v>
<v Speaker 5>eight or nine feet and approached so </v>

1900
01:56:50.701 --> 01:56:51.920
<v Speaker 5>slowly that a man walking could have </v>
<v Speaker 5>kept ahead of it.</v>

1901
01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:55.910
<v Speaker 5>Gas the word quickly passed round even </v>
<v Speaker 5>now,</v>

1902
01:56:55.911 --> 01:57:00.911
<v Speaker 5>it had no terror for us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for we had not yet tasted it from our </v>

1903
01:57:00.911 --> 01:57:02.690
<v Speaker 5>hammer stacks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We hastily drew the flannel belts,</v>

1904
01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:07.780
<v Speaker 5>soak them in water,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and tied them around our mouths and </v>

1905
01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:07.780
<v Speaker 5>noses.</v>

1906
01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:09.920
<v Speaker 5>Suddenly through the communication </v>
<v Speaker 5>trench came rushing.</v>

1907
01:57:09.921 --> 01:57:14.270
<v Speaker 5>A few khaki clad figures,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their eyes glaring out of their heads,</v>

1908
01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:17.510
<v Speaker 5>their hands tearing at their throats as </v>
<v Speaker 5>they came on,</v>

1909
01:57:17.630 --> 01:57:20.870
<v Speaker 5>some stumbled and fell and lay writhing </v>
<v Speaker 5>at the bottom of the trench.</v>

1910
01:57:21.050 --> 01:57:24.650
<v Speaker 5>Choking and gasping will those following</v>
<v Speaker 5>trampled over them.</v>

1911
01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:29.920
<v Speaker 5>If ever men were raving mad with terror,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these men were what was left of our </v>

1912
01:57:29.920 --> 01:57:31.700
<v Speaker 5>section.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Still crouched at the support end of the</v>

1913
01:57:31.701 --> 01:57:36.701
<v Speaker 5>communication trench are frontline.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Judging from the number of men who just </v>

1914
01:57:36.701 --> 01:57:40.481
<v Speaker 5>come from,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it had been abandoned and we now waited </v>

1915
01:57:40.481 --> 01:57:41.390
<v Speaker 5>for the first rush of germans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they did not come.</v>

1916
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:46.750
<v Speaker 5>Our biggest enemy was now within a few </v>
<v Speaker 5>yards of us and in the form of a cloud </v>

1917
01:57:46.750 --> 01:57:48.110
<v Speaker 5>of gas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We caught our first whiff of it.</v>

1918
01:57:48.350 --> 01:57:53.350
<v Speaker 5>No words of mine can ever describe my </v>
<v Speaker 5>feelings as we inhaled the first </v>

1919
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.870
<v Speaker 5>mouthful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We choked,</v>

1920
01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:55.280
<v Speaker 5>spit and coughed.</v>

1921
01:57:55.490 --> 01:57:57.800
<v Speaker 5>My lungs felt as though they were being </v>
<v Speaker 5>burnt out,</v>

1922
01:57:58.010 --> 01:58:03.010
<v Speaker 5>that they were going to burst.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Red hot needles were being thrust into </v>

1923
01:58:03.010 --> 01:58:04.100
<v Speaker 5>my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first impulse Was to run.</v>

1924
01:58:04.490 --> 01:58:09.490
<v Speaker 5>We had just seen men running to certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>death and knew it rather than stay and </v>

1925
01:58:09.490 --> 01:58:11.030
<v Speaker 5>be choked into a slow and agonizing </v>
<v Speaker 5>death.</v>

1926
01:58:11.390 --> 01:58:14.210
<v Speaker 5>It was one of those occasions when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>do not know what you were doing.</v>

1927
01:58:14.540 --> 01:58:17.510
<v Speaker 5>The men who stayed was no braver than </v>
<v Speaker 5>the man who ran away.</v>

1928
01:58:17.810 --> 01:58:19.850
<v Speaker 5>We crouched.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're terrified.</v>

1929
01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:23.120
<v Speaker 5>Stupefied a large shell burst on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>pair of pitt.</v>

1930
01:58:23.330 --> 01:58:28.330
<v Speaker 5>Just where we were sheltered.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were almost buried beneath the </v>

1931
01:58:28.330 --> 01:58:28.550
<v Speaker 5>falling earth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Young addington,</v>

1932
01:58:28.610 --> 01:58:33.610
<v Speaker 5>a chap about my own age was screaming at</v>
<v Speaker 5>the top of his voice and trying to free </v>

1933
01:58:33.610 --> 01:58:37.901
<v Speaker 5>his buried legs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He got free and before we could stop </v>

1934
01:58:37.901 --> 01:58:37.901
<v Speaker 5>him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he rushed off.</v>

1935
01:58:37.901 --> 01:58:40.280
<v Speaker 5>God knows where we then saw the reason </v>
<v Speaker 5>for his screams.</v>

1936
01:58:40.430 --> 01:58:45.430
<v Speaker 5>His left was blown off above the elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He left a trail of blood over my tunic </v>

1937
01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:49.290
<v Speaker 5>as he climbed over me in a mad rush to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get away and to quote</v>

1938
01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:56.120
<v Speaker 5>quintin and his unit of canadians will </v>
<v Speaker 5>block heroically in the hole that </v>

1939
01:58:56.131 --> 01:58:58.920
<v Speaker 5>develops in the line keeping the germans</v>
<v Speaker 5>from breaking through.</v>

1940
01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:04.280
<v Speaker 5>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the germans hadn't expected to break </v>

1941
01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:06.411
<v Speaker 5>through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The entire reason for this gas attack </v>

1942
01:59:06.411 --> 01:59:09.171
<v Speaker 5>was to experiment with the gas and to </v>
<v Speaker 5>cover the fact that the germans were </v>

1943
01:59:09.171 --> 01:59:10.980
<v Speaker 5>removing troops for use on the eastern </v>
<v Speaker 5>front.</v>

1944
01:59:11.430 --> 01:59:16.430
<v Speaker 5>The german high command had no idea it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was going to be this successful and no </v>

1945
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:18.150
<v Speaker 5>one had any idea how horrifying it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be.</v>

1946
01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:23.420
<v Speaker 5>Private.</v>
<v Speaker 5>William quintin and his unit will move </v>

1947
01:59:23.420 --> 01:59:25.431
<v Speaker 5>up to the front line and will experience</v>
<v Speaker 5>the aftermath of what the gas attack did</v>

1948
01:59:26.311 --> 01:59:28.320
<v Speaker 5>to the people who first encountered it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wrote,</v>

1949
01:59:28.321 --> 01:59:33.321
<v Speaker 5>quote black in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their tunics and shirt fronts torn open </v>

1950
01:59:33.321 --> 01:59:37.881
<v Speaker 5>at the next,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in their last desperate fight for </v>

1951
01:59:37.881 --> 01:59:39.921
<v Speaker 5>breath.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Many of them quite still while others </v>

1952
01:59:39.921 --> 01:59:42.921
<v Speaker 5>were still wriggling and kicking in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>agonies of the most awful death I've </v>

1953
01:59:42.921 --> 01:59:46.371
<v Speaker 5>ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some were wounded in the bargain and </v>

1954
01:59:46.371 --> 01:59:46.371
<v Speaker 5>they're gaping wounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lay open.</v>

1955
01:59:46.590 --> 01:59:50.670
<v Speaker 5>Blood's still oozing from them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One poor devil was tearing at his throat</v>

1956
01:59:50.671 --> 01:59:55.671
<v Speaker 5>with his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I doubt if he knew or felt that he had </v>

1957
01:59:55.671 --> 01:59:59.271
<v Speaker 5>only one hand and that the other was </v>
<v Speaker 5>just a stump where the hand should have </v>

1958
01:59:59.271 --> 02:00:03.111
<v Speaker 5>been this stump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He worked around his throat as if his </v>

1959
02:00:03.111 --> 02:00:06.261
<v Speaker 5>hand was still there and the blood from </v>
<v Speaker 5>it was streaming over his bluish black </v>

1960
02:00:06.261 --> 02:00:07.470
<v Speaker 5>face and neck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A few minutes later,</v>

1961
02:00:07.471 --> 02:00:12.471
<v Speaker 5>he was still except for occasional </v>
<v Speaker 5>shutters as he breathed his last and </v>

1962
02:00:12.471 --> 02:00:12.750
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

1963
02:00:15.630 --> 02:00:19.350
<v Speaker 5>as I've said before in this program,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think I will say many times more.</v>

1964
02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:25.280
<v Speaker 5>This is the most horrifying sustained </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation of terribleness I've ever seen</v>

1965
02:00:28.201 --> 02:00:33.201
<v Speaker 5>soldiers forced to endure and millions </v>
<v Speaker 5>and millions of people will get to </v>

1966
02:00:33.481 --> 02:00:35.760
<v Speaker 5>experience this before the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>conflict.</v>

1967
02:00:36.210 --> 02:00:41.210
<v Speaker 5>My own grandfather would be gassed on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the western front and he was never the </v>

1968
02:00:41.210 --> 02:00:45.351
<v Speaker 5>same afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The use of poison gas is a defining </v>

1969
02:00:46.931 --> 02:00:51.931
<v Speaker 5>moment in this conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one that puts the final end stamp on the</v>

1970
02:00:52.001 --> 02:00:55.540
<v Speaker 5>19th century victorian romantic ideals </v>
<v Speaker 5>of warfare.</v>

1971
02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:58.780
<v Speaker 5>You can't pretend anymore when human </v>
<v Speaker 5>beings are being treated.</v>

1972
02:00:59.210 --> 02:01:04.210
<v Speaker 5>You know the way you would treat ants </v>
<v Speaker 5>with a can of raid or some other </v>

1973
02:01:04.210 --> 02:01:08.560
<v Speaker 5>insecticide even before gases used the </v>
<v Speaker 5>times of london,</v>

1974
02:01:09.451 --> 02:01:12.600
<v Speaker 5>the great paper in britain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In November,</v>

1975
02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:17.600
<v Speaker 5>1914,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll run an article which seems amazing</v>

1976
02:01:17.851 --> 02:01:22.851
<v Speaker 5>by modern standards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but of course we're in a post first and </v>

1977
02:01:22.851 --> 02:01:25.911
<v Speaker 5>second world war era now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those people were coming into this </v>

1978
02:01:25.911 --> 02:01:29.421
<v Speaker 5>conflict with certain ideals and </v>
<v Speaker 5>understandings of what war was going to </v>

1979
02:01:29.421 --> 02:01:33.291
<v Speaker 5>be like and the trenches and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>continual death for no apparent gain had</v>

1980
02:01:34.951 --> 02:01:37.680
<v Speaker 5>shaken their whole view of what war was </v>
<v Speaker 5>all about.</v>

1981
02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:39.530
<v Speaker 5>November 19,</v>
<v Speaker 5>14,</v>

1982
02:01:39.531 --> 02:01:41.750
<v Speaker 5>the times ran this piece quote,</v>

1983
02:01:42.940 --> 02:01:47.940
<v Speaker 5>all the spectacular side of the war has </v>
<v Speaker 5>gone never to reappear trenches and </v>

1984
02:01:48.611 --> 02:01:53.260
<v Speaker 5>always trenches and within range of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>concealed guns in visibility.</v>

1985
02:01:53.261 --> 02:01:55.630
<v Speaker 5>The supreme law,</v>
<v Speaker 5>day after day,</v>

1986
02:01:55.631 --> 02:02:00.280
<v Speaker 5>the butchery of the unknown by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>unseen war has become stupid.</v>

1987
02:02:00.580 --> 02:02:05.580
<v Speaker 5>The strain on the infantry is tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it is endless at the cost of </v>

1988
02:02:05.580 --> 02:02:08.230
<v Speaker 5>thousands of lives,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a few hundred yards maybe gained,</v>

1989
02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:13.440
<v Speaker 5>but rarely indeed does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even the most brilliant attack produce </v>

1990
02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:16.240
<v Speaker 5>anything fresh troops brought up under </v>
<v Speaker 5>cover of a tremendous artillery fire,</v>

1991
02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:19.120
<v Speaker 5>which opens up by surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>may affect a breach,</v>

1992
02:02:19.330 --> 02:02:24.330
<v Speaker 5>but only with heavy loss.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can such an attack be carried through </v>

1993
02:02:24.330 --> 02:02:28.410
<v Speaker 5>and to quote that little rundown about </v>
<v Speaker 5>how war has become stupid,</v>

1994
02:02:29.491 --> 02:02:34.491
<v Speaker 5>now accurately describes what the entire</v>
<v Speaker 5>year of 1915 on the western front will </v>

1995
02:02:35.161 --> 02:02:40.161
<v Speaker 5>be like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's going to move at all and </v>

1996
02:02:40.161 --> 02:02:44.490
<v Speaker 5>amazing numbers of people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>die in efforts that gain nothing.</v>

1997
02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:48.800
<v Speaker 5>Now in the defense of the general sue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>order these efforts to gain nothing.</v>

1998
02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:54.520
<v Speaker 5>They have to figure out how to do things</v>
<v Speaker 5>including experimentation to our minds.</v>

1999
02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:58.130
<v Speaker 5>You would think you would stop after a </v>
<v Speaker 5>while,</v>

2000
02:02:58.131 --> 02:03:00.350
<v Speaker 5>but these people had to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 5>to win the war.</v>

2001
02:03:00.351 --> 02:03:01.280
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they didn't even know,</v>

2002
02:03:01.281 --> 02:03:06.281
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to get through the ever expanding </v>

2003
02:03:06.281 --> 02:03:09.140
<v Speaker 5>fields of barbed wire that crop up </v>
<v Speaker 5>between the two enemy trench lines.</v>

2004
02:03:09.290 --> 02:03:14.290
<v Speaker 5>You have to have battles to simply see </v>
<v Speaker 5>what kind of artillery blows up enough </v>

2005
02:03:14.290 --> 02:03:17.480
<v Speaker 5>of the wire to create a path for your </v>
<v Speaker 5>troops to attack through.</v>

2006
02:03:19.280 --> 02:03:23.510
<v Speaker 5>This is lessons being learned at an </v>
<v Speaker 5>incredible cost,</v>

2007
02:03:23.511 --> 02:03:25.340
<v Speaker 5>but there's really no other way to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2008
02:03:27.010 --> 02:03:30.370
<v Speaker 5>It's fascinating to look at pictures </v>
<v Speaker 5>already in 1915,</v>

2009
02:03:31.060 --> 02:03:36.060
<v Speaker 5>six to eight months after the war has </v>
<v Speaker 5>started and see how this period has </v>

2010
02:03:36.060 --> 02:03:40.771
<v Speaker 5>become sort of an estuary between the </v>
<v Speaker 5>19th and the 20th century where you see </v>

2011
02:03:41.651 --> 02:03:44.350
<v Speaker 5>the combination of the two centuries </v>
<v Speaker 5>blending.</v>

2012
02:03:44.351 --> 02:03:49.351
<v Speaker 5>I mean when the war starts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have cavalry that is </v>

2013
02:03:49.351 --> 02:03:52.501
<v Speaker 5>indistinguishable from napoleon's queer </v>
<v Speaker 5>sears going off to war with gleaming </v>

2014
02:03:52.871 --> 02:03:57.871
<v Speaker 5>breastplates and horse herrick helmets </v>
<v Speaker 5>and sabers and spurs and white gloves,</v>

2015
02:03:58.540 --> 02:04:01.150
<v Speaker 5>and now you have gas and soon you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to have,</v>

2016
02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:03.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>german cavalry lancers.</v>

2017
02:04:03.491 --> 02:04:05.710
<v Speaker 5>For example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As soon as 1916 rolls around,</v>

2018
02:04:05.711 --> 02:04:10.711
<v Speaker 5>they start having the same helmet that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the germans would use in the second </v>

2019
02:04:10.711 --> 02:04:10.711
<v Speaker 5>world war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the stall helm,</v>

2020
02:04:10.711 --> 02:04:14.950
<v Speaker 5>and you have know cavalry with lances </v>
<v Speaker 5>and install helm and a gas mask,</v>

2021
02:04:14.951 --> 02:04:19.660
<v Speaker 5>and it's the perfect example of the two </v>
<v Speaker 5>arrows blending in sort of like I said,</v>

2022
02:04:19.661 --> 02:04:24.661
<v Speaker 5>a historical estuary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You go from that napoleonic feeling of </v>

2023
02:04:26.711 --> 02:04:31.120
<v Speaker 5>war with french soldiers going off into </v>
<v Speaker 5>the conflict with bright red pants.</v>

2024
02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:33.250
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in six to eight months later,</v>

2025
02:04:33.251 --> 02:04:35.380
<v Speaker 5>we have gas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we have flame throwers,</v>

2026
02:04:35.650 --> 02:04:39.000
<v Speaker 5>we have hundreds of guns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a time firing on battlefields.</v>

2027
02:04:39.001 --> 02:04:40.530
<v Speaker 5>We have trenches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>barbed wire,</v>

2028
02:04:40.531 --> 02:04:45.531
<v Speaker 5>snipers everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not what anybody thought was </v>

2029
02:04:45.531 --> 02:04:50.151
<v Speaker 5>going to happen and it begins to unhinge</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people,</v>

2030
02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:54.270
<v Speaker 5>which is something that is new to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>human experience,</v>

2031
02:04:54.300 --> 02:04:59.300
<v Speaker 5>at least as far as the modern european </v>
<v Speaker 5>armies are concerned.</v>

2032
02:05:02.030 --> 02:05:03.710
<v Speaker 5>People begin to go insane</v>

2033
02:05:04.850 --> 02:05:07.340
<v Speaker 5>to lose their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to have their nerves shattered,</v>

2034
02:05:07.580 --> 02:05:09.680
<v Speaker 5>and this is something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as I said,</v>

2035
02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:14.740
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this war does something that seems </v>

2036
02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:17.350
<v Speaker 5>unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The ability to take one of the most </v>

2037
02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:20.711
<v Speaker 5>stressful situations human beings ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>find themselves in and make it worse </v>

2038
02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:23.330
<v Speaker 5>because all war is psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 5>challenging,</v>

2039
02:05:23.540 --> 02:05:28.540
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What made the first world war more </v>

2040
02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:32.381
<v Speaker 5>difficult than almost any other major </v>
<v Speaker 5>conflict you can think of is not just </v>

2041
02:05:32.381 --> 02:05:34.610
<v Speaker 5>the changes in warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although that's significant,</v>

2042
02:05:35.210 --> 02:05:39.170
<v Speaker 5>but how long the soldiers were forced to</v>
<v Speaker 5>deal with it.</v>

2043
02:05:40.190 --> 02:05:45.190
<v Speaker 5>I mean take one of the worst battles in </v>
<v Speaker 5>human history to be a soldier in the </v>

2044
02:05:45.861 --> 02:05:50.861
<v Speaker 5>famous second punic war battle of kony,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right where hannibal and his </v>

2045
02:05:51.021 --> 02:05:54.230
<v Speaker 5>carthaginians famously surround maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>80,000</v>

2046
02:05:54.231 --> 02:05:57.680
<v Speaker 5>romans and then spend the entire </v>
<v Speaker 5>afternoon.</v>

2047
02:05:58.220 --> 02:06:03.220
<v Speaker 5>No slaughtering them by hand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cutting their way into the center of </v>

2048
02:06:03.220 --> 02:06:07.421
<v Speaker 5>this crowd of doomed men who have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>wait all day in the most unbelievably </v>

2049
02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:10.940
<v Speaker 5>just orienting environment you can think</v>
<v Speaker 5>of.</v>

2050
02:06:10.940 --> 02:06:12.650
<v Speaker 5>They can't hear anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can't see anything.</v>

2051
02:06:12.651 --> 02:06:17.651
<v Speaker 5>There's dust everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they know what's coming and were </v>

2052
02:06:17.651 --> 02:06:21.011
<v Speaker 5>told by the ancient writers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's so terrible that when the </v>

2053
02:06:21.011 --> 02:06:22.730
<v Speaker 5>carthaginians cut their way into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>center of this massive doomed men,</v>

2054
02:06:23.150 --> 02:06:28.150
<v Speaker 5>they will find that some roman soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 5>packed so tightly that they couldn't </v>

2055
02:06:28.150 --> 02:06:31.520
<v Speaker 5>even raise their hands in this crowd of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people just sunk to their knees,</v>

2056
02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:36.790
<v Speaker 5>dug a little hole with their hands,</v>
<v Speaker 5>put their head in the hole and covered </v>

2057
02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:40.091
<v Speaker 5>it up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>committing suicide because either they </v>

2058
02:06:40.091 --> 02:06:41.570
<v Speaker 5>had lost their minds or they'd come to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the conclusion,</v>

2059
02:06:41.810 --> 02:06:46.810
<v Speaker 5>why wait for the inevitable that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to show you how terrible the </v>

2060
02:06:46.810 --> 02:06:51.311
<v Speaker 5>situation is in the first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You begin to see very quickly people who</v>

2061
02:06:52.431 --> 02:06:54.500
<v Speaker 5>are unhinged,</v>

2062
02:06:56.220 --> 02:06:59.090
<v Speaker 5>these soldiers trapped at the battle of </v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>

2063
02:06:59.091 --> 02:07:04.091
<v Speaker 5>we're having a historic bad day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was one day a week or two before </v>

2064
02:07:06.721 --> 02:07:09.480
<v Speaker 5>that battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were in relatively little danger if</v>

2065
02:07:09.481 --> 02:07:11.430
<v Speaker 5>they survived a week or two after that </v>
<v Speaker 5>battle,</v>

2066
02:07:11.431 --> 02:07:16.431
<v Speaker 5>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The soldiers in the great war had no </v>

2067
02:07:16.431 --> 02:07:20.331
<v Speaker 5>such luxury.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had to deal with these </v>

2068
02:07:20.331 --> 02:07:23.271
<v Speaker 5>circumstances day after day after day </v>
<v Speaker 5>and after this war.</v>

2069
02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:28.640
<v Speaker 5>Military psychologist looking into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>phenomenon of what will later be known </v>

2070
02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:32.691
<v Speaker 5>as shell shock will determine that under</v>
<v Speaker 5>the conditions these soldiers were </v>

2071
02:07:32.691 --> 02:07:34.920
<v Speaker 5>fighting in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter how brave you were.</v>

2072
02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:36.670
<v Speaker 5>Eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2073
02:07:36.671 --> 02:07:39.370
<v Speaker 5>we each had a different threshold we </v>
<v Speaker 5>could stand,</v>

2074
02:07:39.371 --> 02:07:41.440
<v Speaker 5>but eventually anyone would lose their </v>
<v Speaker 5>mind.</v>

2075
02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:46.230
<v Speaker 5>Think about what's involved and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>begin to understand why.</v>

2076
02:07:46.231 --> 02:07:51.231
<v Speaker 5>First take the shelling itself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is something that is really </v>

2077
02:07:52.081 --> 02:07:57.081
<v Speaker 5>impossible for any of us to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are very few people living that </v>

2078
02:07:57.081 --> 02:08:00.741
<v Speaker 5>have ever been through the kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 5>shelling that these world war one </v>

2079
02:08:00.741 --> 02:08:04.071
<v Speaker 5>soldiers routinely had to deal with and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's very hard to describe one of the </v>

2080
02:08:04.980 --> 02:08:09.980
<v Speaker 5>traditional kinds of shelling in that </v>
<v Speaker 5>war was something that came to be known </v>

2081
02:08:09.980 --> 02:08:13.101
<v Speaker 5>as drum fire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Drum fire is so named because it sounds </v>

2082
02:08:13.530 --> 02:08:16.110
<v Speaker 5>like a drum roll.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And instead of,</v>

2083
02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:21.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just hearing the drum being tapped at </v>

2084
02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:23.091
<v Speaker 5>that speed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>each one of those things represent a </v>

2085
02:08:23.091 --> 02:08:25.311
<v Speaker 5>shell going off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how quickly the shells are </v>

2086
02:08:25.311 --> 02:08:25.311
<v Speaker 5>landing.</v>

2087
02:08:25.311 --> 02:08:26.910
<v Speaker 5>Ernst,</v>
<v Speaker 5>younger who we've quoted,</v>

2088
02:08:26.911 --> 02:08:28.380
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the author of the storm of steel,</v>

2089
02:08:28.381 --> 02:08:33.381
<v Speaker 5>one of the most unusual soldiers by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>way in the first world war because he </v>

2090
02:08:33.381 --> 02:08:37.110
<v Speaker 5>kind of liked the war and he kind of saw</v>
<v Speaker 5>positive benefits to it,</v>

2091
02:08:37.111 --> 02:08:39.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so sort of the uplifting side of war.</v>

2092
02:08:39.570 --> 02:08:44.570
<v Speaker 5>And he was about as brave as any soldier</v>
<v Speaker 5>you will ever find lost his composure </v>

2093
02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:50.960
<v Speaker 5>under artillery fire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He explains a situation where he comes </v>

2094
02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:53.760
<v Speaker 5>under fire and just loses his mind </v>
<v Speaker 5>temporarily.</v>

2095
02:08:53.761 --> 02:08:58.761
<v Speaker 5>You know this again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the strongest people mentally in </v>

2096
02:08:58.761 --> 02:09:00.150
<v Speaker 5>the first world war that we know about </v>
<v Speaker 5>and younger says,</v>

2097
02:09:00.151 --> 02:09:00.570
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

2098
02:09:01.800 --> 02:09:06.800
<v Speaker 5>we fell out and extended order and lay </v>
<v Speaker 5>down expectantly and a series of </v>

2099
02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:10.731
<v Speaker 5>flattish depressions that some </v>
<v Speaker 5>predecessors of ours had scooped out of </v>

2100
02:09:10.731 --> 02:09:13.650
<v Speaker 5>the ground are rebelde.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Conversations were suddenly cut off by a</v>

2101
02:09:13.651 --> 02:09:18.060
<v Speaker 5>marrow freezing cry 20 yards behind us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>clumps of earth,</v>

2102
02:09:18.061 --> 02:09:20.970
<v Speaker 5>world up out of a white cloud and </v>
<v Speaker 5>smacked into the bows.</v>

2103
02:09:21.330 --> 02:09:24.450
<v Speaker 5>The crash echoed through the woods </v>
<v Speaker 5>stricken eyes,</v>

2104
02:09:24.451 --> 02:09:29.451
<v Speaker 5>looked at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bodies pressed themselves into the </v>

2105
02:09:29.451 --> 02:09:31.230
<v Speaker 5>ground with a humbling sensation of </v>
<v Speaker 5>powerlessness to do anything else.</v>

2106
02:09:31.720 --> 02:09:35.490
<v Speaker 5>Explosion followed explosion choking </v>
<v Speaker 5>gases drifted over,</v>

2107
02:09:35.491 --> 02:09:38.280
<v Speaker 5>the undergrowth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>smoke obscured the tree tops,</v>

2108
02:09:38.430 --> 02:09:40.710
<v Speaker 5>trees and branches came crashing to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ground,</v>

2109
02:09:40.711 --> 02:09:43.770
<v Speaker 5>screams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We leapt up and ran blindly,</v>

2110
02:09:43.980 --> 02:09:47.580
<v Speaker 5>chased by lightnings and crushing air </v>
<v Speaker 5>pressure from tree to tree,</v>

2111
02:09:47.790 --> 02:09:52.790
<v Speaker 5>looking for cover,</v>
<v Speaker 5>skirting around giant tree trunks like </v>

2112
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:56.151
<v Speaker 5>frightened game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a dugout where many men had taken </v>

2113
02:09:56.151 --> 02:09:56.490
<v Speaker 5>shelter and which I too was running </v>
<v Speaker 5>towards,</v>

2114
02:09:56.610 --> 02:10:01.610
<v Speaker 5>took a direct hit that ripped up the </v>
<v Speaker 5>planking and sent heavy timber spinning </v>

2115
02:10:01.610 --> 02:10:04.350
<v Speaker 5>through the air like a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 5>squirrels having stones thrown at them.</v>

2116
02:10:04.470 --> 02:10:09.470
<v Speaker 5>The nco and I dodged panting around a </v>
<v Speaker 5>huge beach tree quite mechanically and </v>

2117
02:10:09.691 --> 02:10:14.691
<v Speaker 5>spurred on by further explosions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ran after my superior who sometimes </v>

2118
02:10:14.691 --> 02:10:16.890
<v Speaker 5>turn round and stared at me wild.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I yelling,</v>

2119
02:10:17.130 --> 02:10:19.880
<v Speaker 5>what in god's name are those things?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are they?</v>

2120
02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:24.120
<v Speaker 5>Suddenly there was a flash among the </v>
<v Speaker 5>route work and a below on the left thigh</v>

2121
02:10:24.121 --> 02:10:29.121
<v Speaker 5>flung me to the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought I had been struck by a clump </v>

2122
02:10:29.121 --> 02:10:32.271
<v Speaker 5>of earth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the warm trickle of blood indicated </v>

2123
02:10:32.271 --> 02:10:33.060
<v Speaker 5>that I had been wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Later I saw that a needle sharp piece of</v>

2124
02:10:33.590 --> 02:10:38.590
<v Speaker 5>had given me a flesh wound.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't my wallet had taken the brunt of </v>

2125
02:10:38.590 --> 02:10:38.590
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fine cut,</v>

2126
02:10:38.590 --> 02:10:40.490
<v Speaker 5>which before slicing into the muscle had</v>
<v Speaker 5>split.</v>

2127
02:10:40.491 --> 02:10:45.491
<v Speaker 5>No fewer than nine thicknesses of stout </v>
<v Speaker 5>leather looked as though it might've </v>

2128
02:10:45.491 --> 02:10:48.110
<v Speaker 5>been administered by a scalpel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He continues.</v>

2129
02:10:48.980 --> 02:10:52.460
<v Speaker 5>I threw down my haversack and ran toward</v>
<v Speaker 5>the trench we had come from,</v>

2130
02:10:52.730 --> 02:10:57.730
<v Speaker 5>from all sides,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wounded men were making tracks towards </v>

2131
02:10:57.730 --> 02:10:57.730
<v Speaker 5>it from the shelled woods.</v>

2132
02:10:57.730 --> 02:11:00.680
<v Speaker 5>The trench was appalling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>choked with seriously wounded and dying.</v>

2133
02:11:00.681 --> 02:11:04.130
<v Speaker 5>Men of figure stripped to the waist with</v>
<v Speaker 5>a ripped open back,</v>

2134
02:11:04.190 --> 02:11:09.190
<v Speaker 5>leaned against the parapet another with </v>
<v Speaker 5>a triangular flap hanging off the back </v>

2135
02:11:09.190 --> 02:11:11.690
<v Speaker 5>of his skull emitted short high pitched </v>
<v Speaker 5>screams.</v>

2136
02:11:11.930 --> 02:11:16.930
<v Speaker 5>This was the home of the great god pain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and for the first time I looked through </v>

2137
02:11:16.930 --> 02:11:20.630
<v Speaker 5>a devilish chink into the depths of his </v>
<v Speaker 5>realm and fresh shells came down all the</v>

2138
02:11:20.631 --> 02:11:23.300
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I lost my head completely.</v>

2139
02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:28.540
<v Speaker 5>Ruthlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I barged past every one on my path </v>

2140
02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:29.930
<v Speaker 5>before finally having fallen back a few </v>
<v Speaker 5>times in my haste,</v>

2141
02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:35.140
<v Speaker 5>climbing out of the hellish crush of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>trench to move more freely above like a </v>

2142
02:11:35.140 --> 02:11:39.281
<v Speaker 5>bolting horse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I rushed through the dense undergrowth </v>

2143
02:11:39.281 --> 02:11:42.040
<v Speaker 5>across paths and clearings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To I collapse in the cops by the grand </v>

2144
02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:45.881
<v Speaker 5>trine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she and quote this one of the most </v>

2145
02:11:46.041 --> 02:11:49.010
<v Speaker 5>suicidal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he brave soldiers of the great war.</v>

2146
02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:54.880
<v Speaker 5>If it can happen to him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could happen to anyone and I am </v>

2147
02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:59.080
<v Speaker 5>constantly amazed at the immense bravery</v>
<v Speaker 5>and an almost carelessness of death that</v>

2148
02:12:02.541 --> 02:12:06.890
<v Speaker 5>our grandparents and great grandparents </v>
<v Speaker 5>showed consistently in this conflict and</v>

2149
02:12:06.891 --> 02:12:11.891
<v Speaker 5>I always wonder about how I do or my </v>
<v Speaker 5>generation would do in the same </v>

2150
02:12:12.261 --> 02:12:13.100
<v Speaker 5>situation.</v>

2151
02:12:15.850 --> 02:12:20.850
<v Speaker 5>Younger tries later on to explain what </v>
<v Speaker 5>the feeling of being in an artillery </v>

2152
02:12:21.191 --> 02:12:26.191
<v Speaker 5>barrage is like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's difficult because we have </v>

2153
02:12:26.191 --> 02:12:26.950
<v Speaker 5>nothing to compare it to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you ever been on an airplane,</v>

2154
02:12:26.951 --> 02:12:31.951
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with when it's in heavy turbulence and </v>

2155
02:12:31.951 --> 02:12:31.951
<v Speaker 5>it takes one of those horrible drops in </v>
<v Speaker 5>your stomach?</v>

2156
02:12:31.951 --> 02:12:33.580
<v Speaker 5>Just sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's.</v>

2157
02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:37.480
<v Speaker 5>I can't even describe that feeling and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's nothing younger.</v>

2158
02:12:38.140 --> 02:12:43.140
<v Speaker 5>Writes this in one of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 5>descriptions I've ever heard of what it </v>

2159
02:12:43.140 --> 02:12:46.801
<v Speaker 5>feels like and he was trying to explain </v>
<v Speaker 5>it to people who've never experienced </v>

2160
02:12:46.801 --> 02:12:46.840
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wrote this quote.</v>

2161
02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:52.800
<v Speaker 5>It's an easier manner to describe these </v>
<v Speaker 5>sounds than to endure them because one </v>

2162
02:12:52.811 --> 02:12:57.160
<v Speaker 5>cannot put associate every single sound </v>
<v Speaker 5>of flying steel with the idea of death,</v>

2163
02:12:57.430 --> 02:13:01.600
<v Speaker 5>and so I huddled in my hole in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ground with my hand in front of my face,</v>

2164
02:13:01.810 --> 02:13:04.660
<v Speaker 5>imagining all the possible variants of </v>
<v Speaker 5>being hit.</v>

2165
02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:10.080
<v Speaker 5>I think I found a comparison that </v>
<v Speaker 5>captures the situation in which I and </v>

2166
02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:13.180
<v Speaker 5>all the other soldiers who took part in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this war so often found ourselves.</v>

2167
02:13:13.540 --> 02:13:18.540
<v Speaker 5>You musT imagine that you were securely </v>
<v Speaker 5>tied to a post beinG menaced by a man </v>

2168
02:13:18.540 --> 02:13:23.341
<v Speaker 5>swinging a heavy hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the hammer has been taken back over </v>

2169
02:13:23.341 --> 02:13:24.040
<v Speaker 5>his head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ready to be swung.</v>

2170
02:13:24.190 --> 02:13:28.540
<v Speaker 5>Now it's cleaving the air towards you on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the point of touching your skull.</v>

2171
02:13:28.810 --> 02:13:31.830
<v Speaker 5>Then it struck the post and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>splinters flying.</v>

2172
02:13:32.250 --> 02:13:37.250
<v Speaker 5>That's what it's like to experience </v>
<v Speaker 5>heavy shelling in an exposed position </v>

2173
02:13:37.250 --> 02:13:37.260
<v Speaker 5>and quote.</v>

2174
02:13:40.050 --> 02:13:44.640
<v Speaker 5>Now when you can take cover in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>trench and press yourself up against the</v>

2175
02:13:44.641 --> 02:13:49.500
<v Speaker 5>earth and dig your head into the soil </v>
<v Speaker 5>and try to just weather the storm,</v>

2176
02:13:49.501 --> 02:13:54.501
<v Speaker 5>that's hard enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there are a lot of times in this </v>

2177
02:13:54.501 --> 02:13:57.621
<v Speaker 5>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of times when your job is to run </v>

2178
02:13:57.621 --> 02:13:59.760
<v Speaker 5>through the drum,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fire in the hail of shells,</v>

2179
02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:03.120
<v Speaker 5>to do everything your body tells you not</v>
<v Speaker 5>to do.</v>

2180
02:14:03.121 --> 02:14:06.300
<v Speaker 5>If orange younger can get carried away </v>
<v Speaker 5>by the shell fire,</v>

2181
02:14:06.510 --> 02:14:11.510
<v Speaker 5>you know what hope do regular role joe's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like yours truly have right yulia scotch</v>

2182
02:14:12.710 --> 02:14:16.920
<v Speaker 5>and is in one of those situations that </v>
<v Speaker 5>soldiers all through the war will be in.</v>

2183
02:14:16.921 --> 02:14:19.050
<v Speaker 5>When you know some officer blows a </v>
<v Speaker 5>whistle and says,</v>

2184
02:14:19.051 --> 02:14:22.470
<v Speaker 5>time to jump out of the trench and run </v>
<v Speaker 5>past the gunfire,</v>

2185
02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:26.730
<v Speaker 5>and he writes the feeling you have when </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's your turn.</v>

2186
02:14:28.590 --> 02:14:33.590
<v Speaker 5>We had approached the firing line a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little more than two miles when we got </v>

2187
02:14:33.590 --> 02:14:34.860
<v Speaker 5>within reach of the enemy's curtain of </v>
<v Speaker 5>fire.</v>

2188
02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:38.790
<v Speaker 5>A terrific hail of shells was plowing up</v>
<v Speaker 5>every foot of ground.</v>

2189
02:14:39.090 --> 02:14:44.090
<v Speaker 5>Thousands of corpses of german soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 5>were witnesses to the immense loss as </v>

2190
02:14:44.090 --> 02:14:47.130
<v Speaker 5>the germans had suffered in bringing up </v>
<v Speaker 5>all available reserves.</v>

2191
02:14:47.370 --> 02:14:52.370
<v Speaker 5>the french tried their utmost to prevent</v>
<v Speaker 5>the germans from bringing in their </v>

2192
02:14:52.370 --> 02:14:55.200
<v Speaker 5>reserves and increased their artillery </v>
<v Speaker 5>fire to an unheard of violence.</v>

2193
02:14:55.530 --> 02:14:58.920
<v Speaker 5>It seemed impossible for us to break </v>
<v Speaker 5>through that barricade of fire.</v>

2194
02:14:59.070 --> 02:15:01.500
<v Speaker 5>Hundreds of shells were bursting every </v>
<v Speaker 5>minute.</v>

2195
02:15:01.890 --> 02:15:06.420
<v Speaker 5>We were ordered to pass that hell singly</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that a running pace.</v>

2196
02:15:06.750 --> 02:15:11.750
<v Speaker 5>We were lying on the ground and observed</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the first of our men tried to get </v>

2197
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:13.170
<v Speaker 5>through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>some ran forward like mad,</v>

2198
02:15:13.290 --> 02:15:18.290
<v Speaker 5>not heating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The shells that were bursting around </v>

2199
02:15:18.290 --> 02:15:18.870
<v Speaker 5>them and got through.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Others were entirely buried by the dirt,</v>

2200
02:15:18.871 --> 02:15:22.590
<v Speaker 5>dug up by the shells or were torn to </v>
<v Speaker 5>pieces by shell splinters.</v>

2201
02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:26.790
<v Speaker 5>Two men had scarcely reached the line </v>
<v Speaker 5>when they were struck by a bullseye.</v>

2202
02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.760
<v Speaker 5>I eat the heavy shell,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exploded at their feet,</v>

2203
02:15:29.790 --> 02:15:34.790
<v Speaker 5>leaving nothing of them who can imagine </v>
<v Speaker 5>what we were feeling during these </v>

2204
02:15:34.790 --> 02:15:36.240
<v Speaker 5>harrowing minutes as we lay crouching on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ground,</v>

2205
02:15:36.540 --> 02:15:41.540
<v Speaker 5>not quite a hundred feet away,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seeing everything and only waiting for </v>

2206
02:15:41.540 --> 02:15:46.041
<v Speaker 5>our turn to come.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One had entangled oneself and amaze of </v>

2207
02:15:46.041 --> 02:15:47.310
<v Speaker 5>thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Suddenly one of the officers Would cry.</v>

2208
02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:51.930
<v Speaker 5>The next one that was I just as if </v>
<v Speaker 5>roused out of a bad dream,</v>

2209
02:15:52.110 --> 02:15:57.110
<v Speaker 5>I jumped up and race away like mad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>holding the rifle in my right hand and </v>

2210
02:15:57.121 --> 02:16:02.121
<v Speaker 5>the bayonet in my left eye.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jump aside a few steps in front of to </v>

2211
02:16:02.121 --> 02:16:05.691
<v Speaker 5>bursting shells and running into two </v>
<v Speaker 5>others which are bursting at the same </v>

2212
02:16:05.691 --> 02:16:06.630
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I leapt back several times,</v>

2213
02:16:06.631 --> 02:16:11.631
<v Speaker 5>run forward again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>race about wildly to find a gap through </v>

2214
02:16:11.631 --> 02:16:14.721
<v Speaker 5>which to escape,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but fire an iron everywhere like a </v>

2215
02:16:14.721 --> 02:16:14.721
<v Speaker 5>hunted beast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>

2216
02:16:14.721 --> 02:16:18.600
<v Speaker 5>seek some opening To save oneself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>hell is in front of me and behind me.</v>

2217
02:16:18.601 --> 02:16:22.530
<v Speaker 5>The officers revolver kept ready to </v>
<v Speaker 5>shoot the lumps of steel,</v>

2218
02:16:22.531 --> 02:16:26.670
<v Speaker 5>fall down like a heavy shower from high </v>
<v Speaker 5>above hell and damnation.</v>

2219
02:16:26.910 --> 02:16:30.220
<v Speaker 5>I blindly run and run and run until </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone gets me by my coat.</v>

2220
02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:33.280
<v Speaker 5>Where there someone roars into my ear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stopped.</v>

2221
02:16:33.610 --> 02:16:35.230
<v Speaker 5>Are you wounded?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have a look.</v>

2222
02:16:35.380 --> 02:16:39.100
<v Speaker 5>Perhaps you are and you don't know it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here I am trembling all over.</v>

2223
02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:41.290
<v Speaker 5>Sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The other person says,</v>

2224
02:16:41.330 --> 02:16:43.600
<v Speaker 5>you will feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We trembled too.</v>

2225
02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:45.530
<v Speaker 5>End quote.</v>

2226
02:16:47.700 --> 02:16:52.700
<v Speaker 5>How many of us could do that and think </v>
<v Speaker 5>about the mentality and how these people</v>

2227
02:16:52.711 --> 02:16:54.040
<v Speaker 5>were raised,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2228
02:16:54.060 --> 02:16:57.030
<v Speaker 5>and what was involved that allowed them </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do this.</v>

2229
02:16:57.031 --> 02:17:02.031
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a feeling that my generation </v>

2230
02:17:02.031 --> 02:17:04.041
<v Speaker 5>would just turn around at the office or </v>
<v Speaker 5>holding a gun to wash to get us to do </v>

2231
02:17:04.041 --> 02:17:05.790
<v Speaker 5>that and figure that guy can't take us </v>
<v Speaker 5>all out.</v>

2232
02:17:05.791 --> 02:17:10.791
<v Speaker 5>We're not going into that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We did a history show once about the </v>

2233
02:17:10.921 --> 02:17:14.040
<v Speaker 5>question of whether the older generation</v>
<v Speaker 5>raised in a different time.</v>

2234
02:17:14.041 --> 02:17:19.041
<v Speaker 5>We're tougher than we were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and of course there's no way to really </v>

2235
02:17:19.041 --> 02:17:22.371
<v Speaker 5>come to any conclusions about that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when you read this and you see what </v>

2236
02:17:22.371 --> 02:17:24.060
<v Speaker 5>our grandparents and great grandparents </v>
<v Speaker 5>did,</v>

2237
02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:29.670
<v Speaker 5>it boggles the mind and if those shells </v>
<v Speaker 5>will drive you insane,</v>

2238
02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:35.360
<v Speaker 5>the carnage that they create that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have to live around every day just may.</v>

2239
02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:41.120
<v Speaker 5>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the terrible things about this </v>

2240
02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:42.891
<v Speaker 5>battle that's different from most of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>second world war is in the second world </v>

2241
02:17:42.891 --> 02:17:44.010
<v Speaker 5>war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have what's called the moving front.</v>

2242
02:17:44.190 --> 02:17:48.630
<v Speaker 5>When dire in his famous piece war talked</v>
<v Speaker 5>about the continuous front,</v>

2243
02:17:48.631 --> 02:17:53.631
<v Speaker 5>as he calls it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the first world war initiated in the </v>

2244
02:17:53.631 --> 02:17:55.290
<v Speaker 5>second world war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The continuous front moves,</v>

2245
02:17:55.291 --> 02:18:00.291
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have blitzkrieg and the people are </v>

2246
02:18:00.291 --> 02:18:01.410
<v Speaker 5>continually changing locations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What makes the battlefields of the first</v>

2247
02:18:01.411 --> 02:18:02.490
<v Speaker 5>world war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as we said earlier,</v>

2248
02:18:02.491 --> 02:18:06.120
<v Speaker 5>so particularly horrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that it doesn't change location.</v>

2249
02:18:06.570 --> 02:18:11.130
<v Speaker 5>You get to live around the carnage from </v>
<v Speaker 5>years past,</v>

2250
02:18:11.131 --> 02:18:14.520
<v Speaker 5>even in the second world war eugene </v>
<v Speaker 5>sledge riding,</v>

2251
02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:17.970
<v Speaker 5>you know from the us marines talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about fighting in the pacific.</v>

2252
02:18:18.210 --> 02:18:23.210
<v Speaker 5>We'll talk about his particularly </v>
<v Speaker 5>horrified feeling as he watched flies </v>

2253
02:18:23.670 --> 02:18:26.310
<v Speaker 5>that were feeding on dead bodies right </v>
<v Speaker 5>near him,</v>

2254
02:18:26.550 --> 02:18:30.900
<v Speaker 5>fly right to the edge of his coffee cup </v>
<v Speaker 5>and land in his coffee.</v>

2255
02:18:31.530 --> 02:18:36.530
<v Speaker 5>these are the little horrifying things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you would think after a while will </v>

2256
02:18:36.530 --> 02:18:40.080
<v Speaker 5>just drive you out of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Phillip gibbs and his absolutely </v>

2257
02:18:41.531 --> 02:18:45.820
<v Speaker 5>groundbreaking work now it can be told </v>
<v Speaker 5>was a journalist on the scene,</v>

2258
02:18:45.821 --> 02:18:48.610
<v Speaker 5>as we said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and unable to write about the reality of</v>

2259
02:18:48.611 --> 02:18:53.110
<v Speaker 5>the war until afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He describes one of these situations and</v>

2260
02:18:53.111 --> 02:18:56.590
<v Speaker 5>just how incredible it was to have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>live in this.</v>

2261
02:18:56.830 --> 02:18:58.630
<v Speaker 5>It's worse than the charnel house.</v>

2262
02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:05.320
<v Speaker 5>He describes an area called a huge that </v>
<v Speaker 5>was so terrible near the battlefield and</v>

2263
02:19:08.631 --> 02:19:09.260
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

2264
02:19:10.430 --> 02:19:14.540
<v Speaker 5>the worst school of war for the sons of </v>
<v Speaker 5>gentleman was in those days and for long</v>

2265
02:19:14.541 --> 02:19:19.541
<v Speaker 5>afterwards huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This was the devil's playground and his </v>

2266
02:19:19.541 --> 02:19:23.240
<v Speaker 5>chamber of horrors wherein he devised </v>
<v Speaker 5>mary tortures for young christian men.</v>

2267
02:19:23.570 --> 02:19:28.570
<v Speaker 5>It waS not far out of [inaudible] to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>left of the men and road and to the of </v>

2268
02:19:28.570 --> 02:19:30.890
<v Speaker 5>is wildwood and sanctuary would for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

2269
02:19:30.891 --> 02:19:35.891
<v Speaker 5>There was a chateau.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're called the white shadow with </v>

2270
02:19:35.891 --> 02:19:38.150
<v Speaker 5>excellent stables and good accommodation</v>
<v Speaker 5>for one of our brigades staffs until one</v>

2271
02:19:38.151 --> 02:19:43.151
<v Speaker 5>of our generals was killed and others </v>
<v Speaker 5>wounded by a shell which broke up their </v>

2272
02:19:43.151 --> 02:19:43.520
<v Speaker 5>conference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Afterwards.</v>

2273
02:19:43.521 --> 02:19:48.521
<v Speaker 5>There was no shadow but only a rubble of</v>
<v Speaker 5>bricks banked up with sandbags and deep </v>

2274
02:19:48.521 --> 02:19:53.131
<v Speaker 5>mind craters filled with stinking water </v>
<v Speaker 5>slopping over from the belvoir data lake</v>

2275
02:19:53.540 --> 02:19:55.040
<v Speaker 5>and low lying pools.</v>

2276
02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:58.640
<v Speaker 5>Bodies and bits of bodies and clots of </v>
<v Speaker 5>blood and green.</v>

2277
02:19:58.641 --> 02:20:03.641
<v Speaker 5>Metallic looking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Slime made by explosive gases were </v>

2278
02:20:03.641 --> 02:20:07.241
<v Speaker 5>floating on the surface of that water </v>
<v Speaker 5>below the crater banks when I first </v>

2279
02:20:07.241 --> 02:20:11.051
<v Speaker 5>passed that way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so it was always our men live there </v>

2280
02:20:11.051 --> 02:20:15.340
<v Speaker 5>and died there within a few yards of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>enemy crouched below the sand bags and </v>

2281
02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:18.470
<v Speaker 5>pasted into the mud banks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they dug to get deeper,</v>

2282
02:20:18.471 --> 02:20:23.471
<v Speaker 5>cover their shovels went into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>softness of dead bodies who had been </v>

2283
02:20:23.471 --> 02:20:24.620
<v Speaker 5>their comrades.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Scraps of flesh,</v>

2284
02:20:24.800 --> 02:20:27.260
<v Speaker 5>booted legs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blackened hands,</v>

2285
02:20:27.410 --> 02:20:32.410
<v Speaker 5>eilis heads came falling over them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When the enemy trench more in their </v>

2286
02:20:32.410 --> 02:20:34.840
<v Speaker 5>position or blew up a new mineshaft end </v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

2287
02:20:37.060 --> 02:20:42.060
<v Speaker 5>how would that not drive anybody crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is war made worse.</v>

2288
02:20:43.840 --> 02:20:48.520
<v Speaker 5>That's you living in zombie land and </v>
<v Speaker 5>being shelled at the same time.</v>

2289
02:20:48.550 --> 02:20:50.320
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is,</v>

2290
02:20:50.321 --> 02:20:52.150
<v Speaker 5>As I said many times and will continue </v>
<v Speaker 5>to say,</v>

2291
02:20:52.270 --> 02:20:57.270
<v Speaker 5>this is the worst experience for </v>
<v Speaker 5>soldiers in warfare I've ever seen on a </v>

2292
02:20:57.270 --> 02:21:00.841
<v Speaker 5>mass scale,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even in stalin grodd and the second </v>

2293
02:21:00.841 --> 02:21:04.801
<v Speaker 5>world war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>widely considered one of the worst </v>

2294
02:21:04.801 --> 02:21:07.501
<v Speaker 5>places to be in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That just equals the experience that </v>

2295
02:21:07.501 --> 02:21:10.750
<v Speaker 5>many men on the western front got to </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience routinely.</v>

2296
02:21:12.100 --> 02:21:17.100
<v Speaker 5>How did they deal with it in ways that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are some sort of a wonderful testament </v>

2297
02:21:19.031 --> 02:21:22.090
<v Speaker 5>to human nature?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They often joked about it.</v>

2298
02:21:23.140 --> 02:21:28.140
<v Speaker 5>They adopted a sort of gallows humor at </v>
<v Speaker 5>times that reminds you of police </v>

2299
02:21:29.351 --> 02:21:34.351
<v Speaker 5>officers or firemen or let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>journalists and soldiers and people who </v>

2300
02:21:35.081 --> 02:21:38.520
<v Speaker 5>see this horrible stuff and their way of</v>
<v Speaker 5>coping with it.</v>

2301
02:21:38.860 --> 02:21:39.700
<v Speaker 5>His humor,</v>

2302
02:21:41.860 --> 02:21:45.970
<v Speaker 5>the journalist Philip Gibbs experienced </v>
<v Speaker 5>this and took part in it,</v>

2303
02:21:46.390 --> 02:21:48.430
<v Speaker 5>and this was his theory on the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

2304
02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:54.720
<v Speaker 5>It was astonishing how loudly one laugh </v>
<v Speaker 5>to tales of gruesome things of wars </v>

2305
02:21:54.720 --> 02:21:59.641
<v Speaker 5>brutality I with the rest of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think at the bottom of it was a sense </v>

2306
02:21:59.641 --> 02:22:04.321
<v Speaker 5>of the ironical contrast between the </v>
<v Speaker 5>normal ways of civilian life and this </v>

2307
02:22:04.321 --> 02:22:09.211
<v Speaker 5>hark back to the cave man code.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it made all of our old philosophy of </v>

2308
02:22:09.211 --> 02:22:13.951
<v Speaker 5>life monstrously ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It played the hat trick with the </v>

2309
02:22:13.951 --> 02:22:17.380
<v Speaker 5>gentility of modern manners.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Men who had been brought up to christian</v>

2310
02:22:17.381 --> 02:22:22.381
<v Speaker 5>virtues who would prattle dear little </v>
<v Speaker 5>prayers at their mother's knees who had </v>

2311
02:22:22.381 --> 02:22:25.120
<v Speaker 5>grown up to love poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>painting music,</v>

2312
02:22:25.260 --> 02:22:30.260
<v Speaker 5>the gentle arts over sensitized to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>subtleties of halftones delicate scales </v>

2313
02:22:31.111 --> 02:22:33.990
<v Speaker 5>of emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fastidious in their choice of words,</v>

2314
02:22:34.110 --> 02:22:39.110
<v Speaker 5>in their sense of beauty found </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves compelled to live and act </v>

2315
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:41.430
<v Speaker 5>like eight men and it was a bottom </v>
<v Speaker 5>bubbly funny.</v>

2316
02:22:41.790 --> 02:22:46.790
<v Speaker 5>They laughed at the most frightful </v>
<v Speaker 5>episodes which revealed this contrast </v>

2317
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:49.680
<v Speaker 5>between civilized ethics and the old </v>
<v Speaker 5>beast law.</v>

2318
02:22:49.920 --> 02:22:54.920
<v Speaker 5>The more revolting it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more sometimes they shouted with </v>

2319
02:22:54.920 --> 02:22:55.890
<v Speaker 5>laughter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially in reminiscence,</v>

2320
02:22:56.040 --> 02:23:01.040
<v Speaker 5>when the tail was told of the gilded </v>
<v Speaker 5>sAlon of the french chateau or at the </v>

2321
02:23:01.040 --> 02:23:01.140
<v Speaker 5>table,</v>

2322
02:23:02.290 --> 02:23:07.290
<v Speaker 5>it was I think he writes the Laughter of</v>
<v Speaker 5>mortals at the trick which had been </v>

2323
02:23:07.290 --> 02:23:10.870
<v Speaker 5>played on them by an ironical fate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had been taught to belIeve that the</v>

2324
02:23:10.871 --> 02:23:15.871
<v Speaker 5>whole object of life was to reach out to</v>
<v Speaker 5>beauty and love and that mankind in its </v>

2325
02:23:15.971 --> 02:23:19.300
<v Speaker 5>progress to perfection had killed the </v>
<v Speaker 5>beast instinct,</v>

2326
02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:21.040
<v Speaker 5>cruelty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blood,</v>

2327
02:23:21.041 --> 02:23:24.670
<v Speaker 5>lust,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the primitive savage laws of survival by</v>

2328
02:23:24.671 --> 02:23:28.270
<v Speaker 5>tooth and claw and club and acts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all poetry,</v>

2329
02:23:28.330 --> 02:23:31.540
<v Speaker 5>all art.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All religion had preached this gospel in</v>

2330
02:23:31.541 --> 02:23:36.541
<v Speaker 5>this promise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now that ideal had broken like a China </v>

2331
02:23:36.541 --> 02:23:38.710
<v Speaker 5>vase dash to hard ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The contrast between that,</v>

2332
02:23:38.830 --> 02:23:43.830
<v Speaker 5>and this was devastating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and to quote the stories that they told </v>

2333
02:23:46.970 --> 02:23:50.780
<v Speaker 5>were both funny and revealing in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>horrified way,</v>

2334
02:23:50.781 --> 02:23:55.781
<v Speaker 5>like the gallows humor you see from </v>
<v Speaker 5>police officers and soldiers and </v>

2335
02:23:55.781 --> 02:23:58.991
<v Speaker 5>whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>OnE of the ones is this one quote in one</v>

2336
02:23:59.771 --> 02:24:04.771
<v Speaker 5>section of trenches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the men made a habit of bedding upon </v>

2337
02:24:04.771 --> 02:24:04.771
<v Speaker 5>those who would be wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First.</v>

2338
02:24:04.990 --> 02:24:07.540
<v Speaker 5>It had all the uncertainty of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>roulette table.</v>

2339
02:24:07.690 --> 02:24:11.710
<v Speaker 5>One day when the german gunners were </v>
<v Speaker 5>putting over a special dose of hate,</v>

2340
02:24:11.950 --> 02:24:16.900
<v Speaker 5>a sergeant kept coming to one dugout to </v>
<v Speaker 5>inquire about a quote end quote,</v>

2341
02:24:16.990 --> 02:24:21.010
<v Speaker 5>new chum who had come up with the drafts</v>
<v Speaker 5>is private smith.</v>

2342
02:24:21.011 --> 02:24:22.180
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he asked,</v>

2343
02:24:22.420 --> 02:24:23.050
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sergeant,</v>

2344
02:24:23.051 --> 02:24:28.051
<v Speaker 5>he's all right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>answered the men crouching in the dark </v>

2345
02:24:28.051 --> 02:24:28.051
<v Speaker 5>hole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Private.</v>

2346
02:24:28.051 --> 02:24:28.960
<v Speaker 5>Smith isn't wounded yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Asked the sergeant again.</v>

2347
02:24:28.961 --> 02:24:30.970
<v Speaker 5>Five minutes later,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no sergeant</v>

2348
02:24:31.550 --> 02:24:35.540
<v Speaker 5>private smith was touched by this </v>
<v Speaker 5>interest in his wellbeing and said,</v>

2349
02:24:35.870 --> 02:24:38.240
<v Speaker 5>that sergeant seems a very kind man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

2350
02:24:38.241 --> 02:24:42.770
<v Speaker 5>the boy seems to love me like a father.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A yell of laughter answered him.</v>

2351
02:24:42.980 --> 02:24:45.770
<v Speaker 5>You pour bleediNg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fools said one of his comrades,</v>

2352
02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:48.230
<v Speaker 5>he's drawn you in a lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stood dwayne,</v>

2353
02:24:48.290 --> 02:24:53.290
<v Speaker 5>if you'd been hit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and another example of this amazing </v>

2354
02:24:55.581 --> 02:25:00.440
<v Speaker 5>ability of human beings to adapt in </v>
<v Speaker 5>these kinds of situations with the tools</v>

2355
02:25:00.441 --> 02:25:02.060
<v Speaker 5>given to us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including humor,</v>

2356
02:25:02.061 --> 02:25:02.950
<v Speaker 5>which again you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2357
02:25:02.951 --> 02:25:07.951
<v Speaker 5>you look at survivors of auschwitz and </v>
<v Speaker 5>treblinka and the death camps of the </v>

2358
02:25:08.091 --> 02:25:13.091
<v Speaker 5>nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The jews were using humor even there to </v>

2359
02:25:13.091 --> 02:25:15.140
<v Speaker 5>cope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gibbs tells this story quote</v>

2360
02:25:16.740 --> 02:25:21.740
<v Speaker 5>in digging new trenches in new dugouts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bodies and bits of bodies were on earth </v>

2361
02:25:21.780 --> 02:25:26.780
<v Speaker 5>and put into sand bags with the soil </v>
<v Speaker 5>that was sent back down the line of men </v>

2362
02:25:26.780 --> 02:25:31.051
<v Speaker 5>concealing their work from german eyes </v>
<v Speaker 5>waiting for any new activity in our </v>

2363
02:25:31.051 --> 02:25:32.020
<v Speaker 5>ditches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bit of bill said,</v>

2364
02:25:32.021 --> 02:25:35.320
<v Speaker 5>the leading man putting in the leg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Another bit of bill,</v>

2365
02:25:35.380 --> 02:25:37.870
<v Speaker 5>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>unearthing a hand bills,</v>

2366
02:25:37.871 --> 02:25:42.871
<v Speaker 5>ugly mug.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said at a later stage in the </v>

2367
02:25:42.871 --> 02:25:43.720
<v Speaker 5>operation when a head was found,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gibbs says,</v>

2368
02:25:43.721 --> 02:25:45.370
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as told afterwards,</v>

2369
02:25:45.371 --> 02:25:47.680
<v Speaker 5>that little episode in the trenches </v>
<v Speaker 5>seemed immensely.</v>

2370
02:25:47.681 --> 02:25:52.681
<v Speaker 5>Comic generals chuckled over it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Chaplains treasured it and quote all the</v>

2371
02:25:54.341 --> 02:25:58.450
<v Speaker 5>coping mechanisms in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Though we're not enough to help.</v>

2372
02:25:59.110 --> 02:26:02.020
<v Speaker 5>You know when things got to a really </v>
<v Speaker 5>critical stage,</v>

2373
02:26:02.860 --> 02:26:05.560
<v Speaker 5>every human being has a breaking point </v>
<v Speaker 5>as we said,</v>

2374
02:26:06.370 --> 02:26:10.150
<v Speaker 5>and what in the first world war was </v>
<v Speaker 5>called shell shock.</v>

2375
02:26:10.450 --> 02:26:14.170
<v Speaker 5>We mentioned it earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would later be updated to battle fatigue</v>

2376
02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:19.680
<v Speaker 5>as soon as the experts realized it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>an imprecise term because you didn't </v>

2377
02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:21.400
<v Speaker 5>have to be exposed to artillery shells </v>
<v Speaker 5>at all to get it.</v>

2378
02:26:21.850 --> 02:26:24.310
<v Speaker 5>Now we would call It post traumatic </v>
<v Speaker 5>stress disorder.</v>

2379
02:26:24.311 --> 02:26:27.940
<v Speaker 5>You see it in soldiers today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty common now.</v>

2380
02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:33.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm not just not a historian.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a psychologist either,</v>

2381
02:26:33.161 --> 02:26:36.520
<v Speaker 5>so take this with a grain of salt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is something that appears to be</v>

2382
02:26:36.521 --> 02:26:41.521
<v Speaker 5>what they call a spectrum disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>meaning you can have a severity scale </v>

2383
02:26:41.521 --> 02:26:45.970
<v Speaker 5>like one to 10,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and not to minimize anything our current</v>

2384
02:26:45.971 --> 02:26:50.971
<v Speaker 5>veterans go through,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they'll often come back from these </v>

2385
02:26:50.971 --> 02:26:50.971
<v Speaker 5>wars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2386
02:26:50.971 --> 02:26:54.860
<v Speaker 5>with nightmares or an inability to sleep</v>
<v Speaker 5>or eat properly or to reintegrate into </v>

2387
02:26:54.911 --> 02:26:57.970
<v Speaker 5>society and they've obviously suffered </v>
<v Speaker 5>some trauma and damage.</v>

2388
02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:03.600
<v Speaker 5>In the first world war though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those people would often be shot if you </v>

2389
02:27:03.761 --> 02:27:05.560
<v Speaker 5>couldn't see visible evidence.</v>

2390
02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:07.690
<v Speaker 5>And oftentimes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if you could,</v>

2391
02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:11.980
<v Speaker 5>the people in that era,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially early in the war,</v>

2392
02:27:12.400 --> 02:27:15.460
<v Speaker 5>didn't look at this as some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>legitimate problem.</v>

2393
02:27:15.461 --> 02:27:20.461
<v Speaker 5>To them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this was just another manifestation of </v>

2394
02:27:20.461 --> 02:27:20.920
<v Speaker 5>cowardice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>punishable by death.</v>

2395
02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:24.550
<v Speaker 5>Take for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Philip Gibbs,</v>

2396
02:27:24.551 --> 02:27:29.551
<v Speaker 5>his account,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he has a bunch of them because this </v>

2397
02:27:29.551 --> 02:27:29.551
<v Speaker 5>was one of the things that upset him the</v>
<v Speaker 5>most.</v>

2398
02:27:29.551 --> 02:27:33.930
<v Speaker 5>He would go to the front report on what </v>
<v Speaker 5>the soldiers had to endure and then once</v>

2399
02:27:34.331 --> 02:27:36.530
<v Speaker 5>they were damaged by what they had to </v>
<v Speaker 5>endure,</v>

2400
02:27:36.790 --> 02:27:41.790
<v Speaker 5>report on how the completely clueless </v>
<v Speaker 5>militaries of the day,</v>

2401
02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:47.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then punish them again for something </v>

2402
02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:47.400
<v Speaker 5>they were already victimized once for he</v>
<v Speaker 5>tells one story,</v>

2403
02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:49.480
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of an officer that he's meeting with who</v>

2404
02:27:49.481 --> 02:27:53.680
<v Speaker 5>comes back to the meeting with him from </v>
<v Speaker 5>a court marshal hearing.</v>

2405
02:27:53.681 --> 02:27:58.681
<v Speaker 5>He'd just been to where they had </v>
<v Speaker 5>sentenced one of these people who had </v>

2406
02:27:58.681 --> 02:28:02.290
<v Speaker 5>had his mind blown by his experience to </v>
<v Speaker 5>death.</v>

2407
02:28:02.980 --> 02:28:03.700
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

2408
02:28:04.570 --> 02:28:09.570
<v Speaker 5>going up to kemo one day I had to wait </v>
<v Speaker 5>in battalion headquarters for the </v>

2409
02:28:09.570 --> 02:28:10.840
<v Speaker 5>officer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd gone to see he was attending a court</v>

2410
02:28:10.841 --> 02:28:12.160
<v Speaker 5>marshal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Presently.</v>

2411
02:28:12.161 --> 02:28:14.620
<v Speaker 5>He came into the wooden hut with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>flushed face.</v>

2412
02:28:14.980 --> 02:28:16.240
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had to keep you.</v>

2413
02:28:16.241 --> 02:28:19.300
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tomorrow there will be one swine less in</v>

2414
02:28:19.301 --> 02:28:21.160
<v Speaker 5>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a death sentence.</v>

2415
02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:24.230
<v Speaker 5>Gabe said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He nodded a damned coward,</v>

2416
02:28:24.380 --> 02:28:26.090
<v Speaker 5>said he didn't mind rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fire,</v>

2417
02:28:26.091 --> 02:28:29.240
<v Speaker 5>but couldn't stand shells.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Admitted he left his post.</v>

2418
02:28:29.450 --> 02:28:30.890
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't mind rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fire.</v>

2419
02:28:30.891 --> 02:28:32.600
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tomorrow morning,</v>

2420
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:35.510
<v Speaker 5>the officer laughed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>grimley and then listened for a second.</v>

2421
02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:39.740
<v Speaker 5>There were some heavy crumps fallen over</v>
<v Speaker 5>campbell hill rather close.</v>

2422
02:28:39.741 --> 02:28:44.741
<v Speaker 5>It seemed to our wooden hut.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's talking about artillery shells </v>

2423
02:28:44.741 --> 02:28:44.741
<v Speaker 5>falling nearby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way.</v>

2424
02:28:44.741 --> 02:28:46.760
<v Speaker 5>Damn those german gunners said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the officer,</v>

2425
02:28:47.060 --> 02:28:50.210
<v Speaker 5>why can't they give us a little piece?</v>
<v Speaker 5>he turned to his papers,</v>

2426
02:28:50.420 --> 02:28:52.100
<v Speaker 5>but several times while I talked with </v>
<v Speaker 5>him,</v>

2427
02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:54.740
<v Speaker 5>he jerked his head up and listen to a </v>
<v Speaker 5>heavy crash.</v>

2428
02:28:55.070 --> 02:29:00.070
<v Speaker 5>On the way back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw a man on foot walking in front of </v>

2429
02:29:00.070 --> 02:29:01.670
<v Speaker 5>a mountain man past the old hill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>loved the shepherd berg.</v>

2430
02:29:01.880 --> 02:29:05.090
<v Speaker 5>Toward the village of luck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was something in the way he walked</v>

2431
02:29:05.091 --> 02:29:05.990
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his attitude,</v>

2432
02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:09.770
<v Speaker 5>the head hunched forward a little and </v>
<v Speaker 5>his arms behind his back,</v>

2433
02:29:10.010 --> 02:29:15.010
<v Speaker 5>which made me turn to look at him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was manacled and tied by a rope to </v>

2434
02:29:15.010 --> 02:29:19.361
<v Speaker 5>the mountain man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I caught one glimpse of his face and </v>

2435
02:29:19.361 --> 02:29:22.241
<v Speaker 5>then turned away cold and sick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was doom written on his face and </v>

2436
02:29:22.241 --> 02:29:23.090
<v Speaker 5>in his eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a captured look.</v>

2437
02:29:23.570 --> 02:29:28.570
<v Speaker 5>He was walking to his wall and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>meaning the wall where he was going to </v>

2438
02:29:28.570 --> 02:29:31.790
<v Speaker 5>be put up against and shocked by his </v>
<v Speaker 5>compatriots.</v>

2439
02:29:33.260 --> 02:29:38.260
<v Speaker 5>Gibbs later quotes another general </v>
<v Speaker 5>saying that anyone who comes down with </v>

2440
02:29:38.260 --> 02:29:41.711
<v Speaker 5>these symptoms as a damn coward and he'd</v>
<v Speaker 5>have them all shot now early in the war.</v>

2441
02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:47.420
<v Speaker 5>This is how they thought because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't deal with this routinely.</v>

2442
02:29:47.570 --> 02:29:50.510
<v Speaker 5>There had been a little talk of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>during the so japanese war,</v>

2443
02:29:50.511 --> 02:29:55.511
<v Speaker 5>a decade before this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where the russians were encountering </v>

2444
02:29:55.511 --> 02:29:56.870
<v Speaker 5>this kind of a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this was a new experience.</v>

2445
02:29:56.871 --> 02:29:59.480
<v Speaker 5>This idea of combat fatigue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>battle fatigue,</v>

2446
02:29:59.481 --> 02:30:01.010
<v Speaker 5>shell shocked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This would be stuff by the way,</v>

2447
02:30:01.011 --> 02:30:06.011
<v Speaker 5>that all the major militaries of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world would study after the first world </v>

2448
02:30:06.011 --> 02:30:10.040
<v Speaker 5>war and they would incorporate what they</v>
<v Speaker 5>learned into training procedures and how</v>

2449
02:30:10.041 --> 02:30:14.390
<v Speaker 5>you dealt with combat in the next war to</v>
<v Speaker 5>try to minimize these problems.</v>

2450
02:30:14.570 --> 02:30:19.570
<v Speaker 5>Even later in the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the generals would learn that you need </v>

2451
02:30:19.570 --> 02:30:21.230
<v Speaker 5>to rotate your troops away from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>front lines,</v>

2452
02:30:21.410 --> 02:30:22.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at regular intervals,</v>

2453
02:30:22.581 --> 02:30:27.581
<v Speaker 5>you can't leave them up there </v>
<v Speaker 5>indefinitely or they're all going to go </v>

2454
02:30:27.581 --> 02:30:30.941
<v Speaker 5>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you'll see these times where for a </v>

2455
02:30:30.941 --> 02:30:34.030
<v Speaker 5>week or two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the troops will have to live in the mud </v>

2456
02:30:34.030 --> 02:30:34.790
<v Speaker 5>in three feet of standing water under </v>
<v Speaker 5>shell fire,</v>

2457
02:30:34.791 --> 02:30:35.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the time,</v>

2458
02:30:36.050 --> 02:30:41.050
<v Speaker 5>but then they'll take them to the back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the rear areas that are safer and </v>

2459
02:30:41.050 --> 02:30:43.220
<v Speaker 5>then let them recover and then slowly </v>
<v Speaker 5>move them back toward the front.</v>

2460
02:30:43.220 --> 02:30:48.220
<v Speaker 5>This rotation was intended to keep them </v>
<v Speaker 5>fresh and keep them from becoming </v>

2461
02:30:48.220 --> 02:30:52.151
<v Speaker 5>psychological casualties and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are people who are foaming at the </v>

2462
02:30:52.971 --> 02:30:55.940
<v Speaker 5>mouth sometimes when they are brought </v>
<v Speaker 5>back from the lines.</v>

2463
02:30:55.941 --> 02:30:59.060
<v Speaker 5>These aren't people who are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just can't handle it any more general.</v>

2464
02:30:59.061 --> 02:31:01.010
<v Speaker 5>Although sometimes that's what you </v>
<v Speaker 5>encounter.</v>

2465
02:31:01.250 --> 02:31:06.250
<v Speaker 5>These are people whose limbs have turned</v>
<v Speaker 5>to rigor mortis or who are so palsy.</v>

2466
02:31:06.620 --> 02:31:11.620
<v Speaker 5>They can't walk For the epileptic </v>
<v Speaker 5>seizures or seizure like things you're </v>

2467
02:31:11.620 --> 02:31:13.070
<v Speaker 5>seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can actually go sEe this by the way,</v>

2468
02:31:13.071 --> 02:31:15.710
<v Speaker 5>because after the war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many of these people didn't heal.</v>

2469
02:31:15.711 --> 02:31:17.900
<v Speaker 5>They never healed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Forty years later,</v>

2470
02:31:17.901 --> 02:31:20.010
<v Speaker 5>they're still taking up hospital</v>

2471
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:25.010
<v Speaker 1>space in some of these countries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are films that the doctors made </v>

2472
02:31:25.010 --> 02:31:26.010
<v Speaker 1>showing you these people's symptoms and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're online.</v>

2473
02:31:26.011 --> 02:31:26.730
<v Speaker 1>You can view them.</v>

2474
02:31:28.810 --> 02:31:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Some of these symptoms are so physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>in nature that this is kind of how the </v>

2475
02:31:33.911 --> 02:31:38.911
<v Speaker 1>term shell shock first became </v>
<v Speaker 1>fashionable because there were theories </v>

2476
02:31:38.911 --> 02:31:43.270
<v Speaker 1>that maybe the concussion and the change</v>
<v Speaker 1>in air pressure that the shells nearby,</v>

2477
02:31:43.440 --> 02:31:48.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploding actually did brain damage or </v>

2478
02:31:48.440 --> 02:31:51.181
<v Speaker 1>nerve damage to these people because </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you actually see some of these </v>

2479
02:31:51.181 --> 02:31:54.550
<v Speaker 1>cases and how they're affected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looks like physical damage.</v>

2480
02:31:54.551 --> 02:31:57.130
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like mental damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

2481
02:31:57.131 --> 02:32:00.610
<v Speaker 1>that did not prevent the militaries from</v>
<v Speaker 1>treating this as cowardice,</v>

2482
02:32:00.611 --> 02:32:05.611
<v Speaker 1>especially early on and dishing out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital punishment penalty for it.</v>

2483
02:32:07.470 --> 02:32:12.470
<v Speaker 1>That having been said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still fascinating to me how few </v>

2484
02:32:12.470 --> 02:32:13.650
<v Speaker 1>actually had to be executed for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

2485
02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you can read books where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>british hurt themselves in the 19 </v>

2486
02:32:19.160 --> 02:32:19.160
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a book from the 19 seventies and,</v>

2487
02:32:19.200 --> 02:32:21.300
<v Speaker 1>and it's just this outbreak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2488
02:32:21.301 --> 02:32:26.301
<v Speaker 1>and you look in and 330 people or </v>
<v Speaker 1>executed or something for uh,</v>

2489
02:32:27.120 --> 02:32:28.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running away in combat,</v>

2490
02:32:28.381 --> 02:32:30.390
<v Speaker 1>abandoning your post desertion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those kinds of things.</v>

2491
02:32:30.750 --> 02:32:33.270
<v Speaker 1>And I think to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think my generation,</v>

2492
02:32:33.480 --> 02:32:36.390
<v Speaker 1>if we were forced to go through what </v>
<v Speaker 1>those people had to go through,</v>

2493
02:32:36.720 --> 02:32:38.910
<v Speaker 1>that's how many people they'd shoot in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>month</v>

2494
02:32:40.390 --> 02:32:45.390
<v Speaker 1>because what's happening in 1915 and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can sum up the entire western front in </v>

2495
02:32:45.791 --> 02:32:50.791
<v Speaker 1>1915,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to deal with any of the </v>

2496
02:32:50.791 --> 02:32:52.741
<v Speaker 1>battles is that the situation is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is degenerating into what we understand.</v>

2497
02:32:53.441 --> 02:32:57.220
<v Speaker 1>The first reward would be like on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>western front trenches and defenses that</v>

2498
02:32:57.221 --> 02:33:02.221
<v Speaker 1>are becoming evermore sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are now getting beyond the era where </v>

2499
02:33:02.221 --> 02:33:02.980
<v Speaker 1>we are talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2500
02:33:02.981 --> 02:33:07.981
<v Speaker 1>one long trench on one side and one long</v>
<v Speaker 1>trench on the other and maybe a little </v>

2501
02:33:07.981 --> 02:33:09.550
<v Speaker 1>bit of sophistication here and there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2502
02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:14.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a little barbed wire between and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're entering into a phase now we're on</v>

2503
02:33:14.681 --> 02:33:19.681
<v Speaker 1>the western front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You begin to have to fortifications and </v>

2504
02:33:19.721 --> 02:33:24.721
<v Speaker 1>you're not talking now about successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks going after people.</v>

2505
02:33:25.151 --> 02:33:30.151
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to batter down defenses </v>
<v Speaker 1>that go sometimes miles backwards.</v>

2506
02:33:32.140 --> 02:33:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Historian eric dorm bros describes these</v>
<v Speaker 1>deepening 1915 fortifications like this</v>

2507
02:33:38.210 --> 02:33:38.540
<v Speaker 6>Quote.</v>

2508
02:33:39.960 --> 02:33:42.240
<v Speaker 1>When the Allies attacked in may 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

2509
02:33:42.420 --> 02:33:47.420
<v Speaker 1>the trenches were shielded by two belts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of barbed wire each five feet high and </v>

2510
02:33:47.640 --> 02:33:52.640
<v Speaker 1>30 meters deep behind the wire lay a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trench network consisting of three </v>

2511
02:33:52.640 --> 02:33:55.740
<v Speaker 1>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 meters apart at regular intervals.</v>

2512
02:33:55.741 --> 02:34:00.741
<v Speaker 1>Each tranche had a zigzag or dog leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>traverse to shield defenders from shells</v>

2513
02:34:00.781 --> 02:34:05.010
<v Speaker 1>landing nearby and prevent attackers </v>
<v Speaker 1>from firing machine guns down the entire</v>

2514
02:34:05.011 --> 02:34:10.011
<v Speaker 1>length of the trench.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This network of trenches were supported </v>

2515
02:34:10.011 --> 02:34:13.221
<v Speaker 1>1000 meters back by concrete machine gun</v>
<v Speaker 1>pill boxes to mow down enemies.</v>

2516
02:34:13.711 --> 02:34:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Soldiers who pierced the forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions,</v>

2517
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:17.590
<v Speaker 6>those</v>

2518
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:22.300
<v Speaker 1>already formidable sounding defenses </v>
<v Speaker 1>were increased during the summer.</v>

2519
02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Burrows continues quote during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>summer,</v>

2520
02:34:25.211 --> 02:34:29.080
<v Speaker 1>a second double belt of barbed wire went</v>
<v Speaker 1>into place 1000 meters.</v>

2521
02:34:29.081 --> 02:34:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Behind the rear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pillbox is of the first trench system.</v>

2522
02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Then came a second triple line of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trenches,</v>

2523
02:34:34.691 --> 02:34:39.691
<v Speaker 1>also backed by machine gun emplacements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The defenders also burrowed ever more </v>

2524
02:34:39.691 --> 02:34:42.700
<v Speaker 1>deeply into the ground to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system work optimally.</v>

2525
02:34:42.790 --> 02:34:46.690
<v Speaker 1>Monthly outputs of machine guns had </v>
<v Speaker 1>increased nearly 12 fold.</v>

2526
02:34:47.050 --> 02:34:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Both the first and second trench systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>were linked by communication trenches </v>

2527
02:34:52.050 --> 02:34:56.011
<v Speaker 1>for moving up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reinforcements are retreating </v>

2528
02:34:56.011 --> 02:34:58.260
<v Speaker 1>underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Telephone cables connected the first </v>

2529
02:34:58.260 --> 02:35:00.490
<v Speaker 1>line with the second as well as with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>artillery far to the rear general falcon</v>

2530
02:35:00.491 --> 02:35:05.491
<v Speaker 1>hinds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well-designed kilometers deep double </v>

2531
02:35:05.491 --> 02:35:08.350
<v Speaker 1>killing zones amounted to a massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering and construction project,</v>

2532
02:35:08.650 --> 02:35:13.480
<v Speaker 1>but it was carried out before the allies</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacked again in september and to quote</v>

2533
02:35:14.980 --> 02:35:19.980
<v Speaker 1>that's attacking a fortress now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the allies were also deepening and </v>

2534
02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:22.060
<v Speaker 1>making their trenches more </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated,</v>

2535
02:35:22.300 --> 02:35:27.300
<v Speaker 1>but not to the same degree the germans </v>
<v Speaker 1>were because the allies attitude is why </v>

2536
02:35:27.300 --> 02:35:29.560
<v Speaker 1>would we waste that much effort when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're hoping the next attack or the next</v>

2537
02:35:29.561 --> 02:35:30.970
<v Speaker 1>attack breaks us through.</v>

2538
02:35:30.970 --> 02:35:33.190
<v Speaker 1>We be out of these trenches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be in their trenches.</v>

2539
02:35:33.730 --> 02:35:38.730
<v Speaker 1>The germans have a much more defensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude on the western front at this </v>

2540
02:35:38.730 --> 02:35:39.370
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They plan on staying a while.</v>

2541
02:35:39.700 --> 02:35:44.200
<v Speaker 1>They dig deeper into the earth and build</v>
<v Speaker 1>these bunk houses with timber overhead.</v>

2542
02:35:44.300 --> 02:35:46.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big trees laid down.</v>

2543
02:35:46.091 --> 02:35:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Log cabin style with earth on top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2544
02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they have carpeting on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>floor,</v>

2545
02:35:50.951 --> 02:35:52.780
<v Speaker 1>wallpaper on the walls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shelving.</v>

2546
02:35:52.781 --> 02:35:57.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's in some ways a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2547
02:35:57.491 --> 02:36:02.491
<v Speaker 1>roman empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of hadrian's wall up and down the </v>

2548
02:36:02.491 --> 02:36:03.280
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many belts deep.</v>

2549
02:36:04.030 --> 02:36:09.030
<v Speaker 1>These are insane fortifications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who in their right mind would think you </v>

2550
02:36:09.030 --> 02:36:10.690
<v Speaker 1>want to slam human beings up against </v>
<v Speaker 1>that over and over again.</v>

2551
02:36:11.320 --> 02:36:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>french and british military leadership </v>

2552
02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:18.991
<v Speaker 1>on the continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's who francis military leaders </v>

2553
02:36:18.991 --> 02:36:22.360
<v Speaker 1>also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer has an attitude of just get </v>

2554
02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:24.250
<v Speaker 1>them out there on the sacred soil to </v>
<v Speaker 1>France.</v>

2555
02:36:24.250 --> 02:36:26.800
<v Speaker 1>It's also important resource and </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial territory.</v>

2556
02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:32.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jennifer will waste if necessary and </v>

2557
02:36:32.120 --> 02:36:33.730
<v Speaker 1>entire generation of young frenchman to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eject the honey from francis soil,</v>

2558
02:36:33.970 --> 02:36:38.970
<v Speaker 1>the hun being one of those propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 1>stake names for the germans and the </v>

2559
02:36:39.310 --> 02:36:42.070
<v Speaker 1>british commander of british forces in </v>
<v Speaker 1>France.</v>

2560
02:36:42.190 --> 02:36:44.620
<v Speaker 1>Confusingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unironically named as we said before,</v>

2561
02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:48.130
<v Speaker 1>sir John French agrees with jennifer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just give us more troops.</v>

2562
02:36:48.310 --> 02:36:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Were the bigger boxer in this prize </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and who cares if we hit their </v>

2563
02:36:53.310 --> 02:36:56.380
<v Speaker 1>elbows and their wrists and their bones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going down eventually,</v>

2564
02:36:56.381 --> 02:36:59.890
<v Speaker 1>just give us more troops who will pound </v>
<v Speaker 1>these fortifications down,</v>

2565
02:37:00.940 --> 02:37:02.860
<v Speaker 1>and the way they did this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2566
02:37:03.490 --> 02:37:07.870
<v Speaker 1>was with more guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 15 is not just the beginning of</v>

2567
02:37:07.871 --> 02:37:12.871
<v Speaker 1>the heavy duty trench warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the beginning of the attempts to </v>

2568
02:37:12.871 --> 02:37:15.871
<v Speaker 1>deal with the heavy duty trench warfare </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'd do this with ever increasing </v>

2569
02:37:15.871 --> 02:37:19.870
<v Speaker 1>amounts of guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have bigger caliber and using them for </v>

2570
02:37:19.870 --> 02:37:24.311
<v Speaker 1>longer periods of time in just one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these sort of double headed battles that</v>

2571
02:37:24.621 --> 02:37:29.621
<v Speaker 1>will be fought in the middle of the 1915</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir John French figures out a way to </v>

2572
02:37:29.621 --> 02:37:30.980
<v Speaker 1>break through these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortifications is with many,</v>

2573
02:37:30.981 --> 02:37:35.780
<v Speaker 1>many hours of many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many guns shooting in a confined area.</v>

2574
02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:41.600
<v Speaker 1>He stockpiles piles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five point 2 million shells for use in </v>

2575
02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:41.750
<v Speaker 1>this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Double-headed defensive,</v>

2576
02:37:41.930 --> 02:37:46.930
<v Speaker 1>so you're going to pound these </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortifications and then you're going to </v>

2577
02:37:46.930 --> 02:37:49.700
<v Speaker 1>send men into the gap to occupy them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a french general battan said</v>

2578
02:37:49.701 --> 02:37:54.701
<v Speaker 1>that artillery conquers the ground and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you send the men in afterwards to occupy</v>

2579
02:37:54.861 --> 02:37:57.140
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the 1915 strategy.</v>

2580
02:37:57.141 --> 02:37:59.960
<v Speaker 1>It's also called by some commanders bite</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hold.</v>

2581
02:38:00.410 --> 02:38:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Some of these generals ideas was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2582
02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:05.390
<v Speaker 1>you're grabbing area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you grab it with artillery,</v>

2583
02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:10.480
<v Speaker 1>you take it over with people when all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other side's killed by the </v>

2584
02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:10.480
<v Speaker 1>artillery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you start fortifying it.</v>

2585
02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:13.970
<v Speaker 1>You turn that into your little castle </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now you've just moved your sides,</v>

2586
02:38:13.971 --> 02:38:18.971
<v Speaker 1>fortifications more toward their side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a giant moving war of trenches and </v>

2587
02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:23.120
<v Speaker 1>siege fortifications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when one side takes a new area,</v>

2588
02:38:23.300 --> 02:38:28.300
<v Speaker 1>the other side goes and attacks them </v>
<v Speaker 1>right away before they can fortify it </v>

2589
02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:28.300
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

2590
02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:29.840
<v Speaker 1>It makes it impossible to follow these </v>
<v Speaker 1>battles,</v>

2591
02:38:30.860 --> 02:38:35.860
<v Speaker 1>but that's what 1915 looks like evermore</v>
<v Speaker 1>big guns ever more wasted opportunities,</v>

2592
02:38:36.381 --> 02:38:41.381
<v Speaker 1>evermore futility and the most forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinkers amongst the allied leaders and </v>

2593
02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:47.680
<v Speaker 1>decision makers are looking at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>already at the end of 1914 and they can </v>

2594
02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:48.590
<v Speaker 1>see it in the distance and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking to themselves,</v>

2595
02:38:49.100 --> 02:38:54.100
<v Speaker 1>must we go there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A french thinker as supposed to have </v>

2596
02:38:54.100 --> 02:38:58.150
<v Speaker 1>floated the idea first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was picked up most famously by </v>

2597
02:38:58.150 --> 02:39:00.791
<v Speaker 1>winston churchill and idea of finding a </v>
<v Speaker 1>flank in another fighting theater.</v>

2598
02:39:02.270 --> 02:39:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Why do we have to throw more troops into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meat grinder?</v>

2599
02:39:04.971 --> 02:39:08.750
<v Speaker 1>The british empire is just starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce a decent number of people.</v>

2600
02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:12.440
<v Speaker 1>They've got some building up of troops </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

2601
02:39:12.830 --> 02:39:17.830
<v Speaker 1>These volunteers that first joined up at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very beginning of the war are now </v>

2602
02:39:17.830 --> 02:39:22.270
<v Speaker 1>gone through their training period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to be thrown in early </v>

2603
02:39:22.270 --> 02:39:23.720
<v Speaker 1>like general falcon hind did with those </v>
<v Speaker 1>poor students,</v>

2604
02:39:23.721 --> 02:39:25.850
<v Speaker 1>soldiers they're going to be husband did</v>
<v Speaker 1>for just the right time.</v>

2605
02:39:25.850 --> 02:39:28.100
<v Speaker 1>They're green,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're trained.</v>

2606
02:39:29.270 --> 02:39:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Must we throw these precious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2607
02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:35.060
<v Speaker 1>troops into the meat grinder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More empire troops by the way,</v>

2608
02:39:35.061 --> 02:39:36.380
<v Speaker 1>are also showing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The canadians,</v>

2609
02:39:36.381 --> 02:39:37.700
<v Speaker 1>as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and indians are already there,</v>

2610
02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:42.320
<v Speaker 1>but other troops really from dominions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we said commonwealth earlier and</v>

2611
02:39:42.321 --> 02:39:45.260
<v Speaker 1>although the term was used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not officially the right term until</v>

2612
02:39:45.261 --> 02:39:50.261
<v Speaker 1>between the two wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when commonwealth status is granted to </v>

2613
02:39:50.261 --> 02:39:50.261
<v Speaker 1>some of these places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2614
02:39:50.261 --> 02:39:54.520
<v Speaker 1>let's just call them dominions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Troops from New Zealand and Australia </v>

2615
02:39:54.520 --> 02:39:58.870
<v Speaker 1>raised up again in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in patriotic fervor for the cause and </v>

2616
02:39:58.870 --> 02:40:01.760
<v Speaker 1>large numbers of people relative to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>total population of these places.</v>

2617
02:40:01.970 --> 02:40:06.970
<v Speaker 1>They're on the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you really going to sacrifice all </v>

2618
02:40:06.970 --> 02:40:08.150
<v Speaker 1>these troops into attacking these deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortifications?</v>

2619
02:40:09.670 --> 02:40:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the commanders on the western front,</v>

2620
02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:14.160
<v Speaker 1>french and british who were were of</v>

2621
02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:17.670
<v Speaker 5>the opinion that every person should be </v>
<v Speaker 5>thrown into the western front.</v>

2622
02:40:17.850 --> 02:40:22.850
<v Speaker 5>They would argue that it's only a meat </v>
<v Speaker 5>grinder on the western front because we </v>

2623
02:40:22.850 --> 02:40:24.840
<v Speaker 5>don't have enough men yet to overrun </v>
<v Speaker 5>that meat grinder and you give us enough</v>

2624
02:40:24.841 --> 02:40:28.440
<v Speaker 5>people will will end this war fast and a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot less people will die.</v>

2625
02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:32.290
<v Speaker 5>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as I mentioned earlier,</v>

2626
02:40:32.470 --> 02:40:37.470
<v Speaker 5>a kind of cabal of thinkers who had come</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the conclusion that that sort of </v>

2627
02:40:37.931 --> 02:40:42.931
<v Speaker 5>thinking was mistaken and that surely </v>
<v Speaker 5>there are better ideas out there than to</v>

2628
02:40:43.301 --> 02:40:44.320
<v Speaker 5>throw,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2629
02:40:44.380 --> 02:40:47.560
<v Speaker 5>more and more human beings into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>teeth of the enemy's defenses.</v>

2630
02:40:48.160 --> 02:40:50.170
<v Speaker 5>That cabal had some famous members in </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2631
02:40:50.650 --> 02:40:52.270
<v Speaker 5>Winston churchill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

2632
02:40:52.300 --> 02:40:55.350
<v Speaker 5>maybe the most famous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although lord horacio kitchener,</v>

2633
02:40:55.420 --> 02:41:00.310
<v Speaker 5>the war minister not far behind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and these people were of the opinion,</v>

2634
02:41:00.311 --> 02:41:03.910
<v Speaker 5>I guess you could compare it to a sort </v>
<v Speaker 5>of a predatory idea.</v>

2635
02:41:04.480 --> 02:41:09.480
<v Speaker 5>They had been trying to take down the </v>
<v Speaker 5>nastiest animal in the herd for months </v>

2636
02:41:10.361 --> 02:41:12.880
<v Speaker 5>now and they'd gotten gord in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>process.</v>

2637
02:41:12.881 --> 02:41:17.881
<v Speaker 5>The germans had done damage to every </v>
<v Speaker 5>major member of the ally is by this time</v>

2638
02:41:18.730 --> 02:41:23.730
<v Speaker 5>and there were the great lions of France</v>
<v Speaker 5>and britain and Russia looking around </v>

2639
02:41:23.730 --> 02:41:24.490
<v Speaker 5>and thinking to themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2640
02:41:24.491 --> 02:41:29.491
<v Speaker 5>why don't we just follow the traditional</v>
<v Speaker 5>predatory sort of approach and go after </v>

2641
02:41:29.491 --> 02:41:34.111
<v Speaker 5>the weak and the sick and the old </v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of going after the strong and </v>

2642
02:41:35.561 --> 02:41:40.561
<v Speaker 5>young and dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there was a country in the war now </v>

2643
02:41:40.561 --> 02:41:45.391
<v Speaker 5>that met all three of those key </v>
<v Speaker 5>classifications as a guy like churchill </v>

2644
02:41:45.391 --> 02:41:50.341
<v Speaker 5>would have made them country that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>old and sick and weak.</v>

2645
02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:55.700
<v Speaker 5>There's more than a country was an </v>
<v Speaker 5>empire,</v>

2646
02:41:56.490 --> 02:42:01.490
<v Speaker 5>was a dying empire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been calling a Turkey throughout </v>

2647
02:42:01.490 --> 02:42:06.111
<v Speaker 5>this whole show because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 5>proper name for it in the first world </v>

2648
02:42:06.111 --> 02:42:08.691
<v Speaker 5>war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's another proper name to that </v>

2649
02:42:08.691 --> 02:42:11.031
<v Speaker 5>conjures up a whole different set of </v>
<v Speaker 5>images than the perhaps modern sounding </v>

2650
02:42:11.031 --> 02:42:14.190
<v Speaker 5>name of Turkey and that's the ottoman </v>
<v Speaker 5>empire</v>

2651
02:42:15.810 --> 02:42:20.810
<v Speaker 5>and that conjures up images of sultan </v>
<v Speaker 5>and janissaries and harem and being on </v>

2652
02:42:24.241 --> 02:42:28.740
<v Speaker 5>the gates of vienna,</v>
<v Speaker 5>almost overrunning into central europe.</v>

2653
02:42:28.741 --> 02:42:33.741
<v Speaker 5>At one point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At the height of their history of </v>

2654
02:42:33.741 --> 02:42:35.220
<v Speaker 5>knocking down the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>of constantinople,</v>

2655
02:42:35.730 --> 02:42:37.980
<v Speaker 5>formerly known as byzantium to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>greeks,</v>

2656
02:42:38.130 --> 02:42:42.600
<v Speaker 5>constantinople to the romans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then after the salton,</v>

2657
02:42:42.890 --> 02:42:47.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>got through that historic barrier and </v>

2658
02:42:47.890 --> 02:42:50.061
<v Speaker 5>conquered the city.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He renamed it is stem bowl as sort of a </v>

2659
02:42:50.061 --> 02:42:54.231
<v Speaker 5>momento and giant monument for what his </v>
<v Speaker 5>ottomans had achieved.</v>

2660
02:42:56.950 --> 02:43:01.950
<v Speaker 5>That was when the ottomans were young </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the ottomans were old now and they </v>

2661
02:43:02.671 --> 02:43:07.671
<v Speaker 5>were losing territory over the decades </v>
<v Speaker 5>like nobody's business.</v>

2662
02:43:07.801 --> 02:43:10.290
<v Speaker 5>They were seen as a carcass to be picked</v>
<v Speaker 5>at,</v>

2663
02:43:10.291 --> 02:43:11.770
<v Speaker 5>as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sick man of europe.</v>

2664
02:43:11.771 --> 02:43:16.771
<v Speaker 5>They were called and someone like </v>
<v Speaker 5>churchill looked at Turkey just sitting </v>

2665
02:43:18.161 --> 02:43:19.870
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They come into the war in november,</v>

2666
02:43:19.871 --> 02:43:24.871
<v Speaker 5>several months after the war officially </v>
<v Speaker 5>starts and they're surrounded by water </v>

2667
02:43:24.871 --> 02:43:26.890
<v Speaker 5>and they're maybe not even a second rate</v>
<v Speaker 5>power.</v>

2668
02:43:26.890 --> 02:43:29.440
<v Speaker 5>They have the territory of a big second </v>
<v Speaker 5>rate power.</v>

2669
02:43:29.441 --> 02:43:33.370
<v Speaker 5>Lots of places trying to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Turkey but still stuck in Turkey.</v>

2670
02:43:33.730 --> 02:43:35.530
<v Speaker 5>That's how an read might look at it or </v>
<v Speaker 5>occurred.</v>

2671
02:43:35.531 --> 02:43:40.531
<v Speaker 5>My look at it or an armenian might look </v>
<v Speaker 5>at it nonetheless without the means to </v>

2672
02:43:40.961 --> 02:43:44.620
<v Speaker 5>sort of protect all that territory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then one of their main reasons there</v>

2673
02:43:44.621 --> 02:43:49.621
<v Speaker 5>had been a war called the crimean war in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the middle of the 19th century is </v>

2674
02:43:49.621 --> 02:43:54.211
<v Speaker 5>because Turkey was so weak and yet so </v>
<v Speaker 5>filled with territory you could take </v>

2675
02:43:54.850 --> 02:43:59.850
<v Speaker 5>that the british and the french had to </v>
<v Speaker 5>get involved to keep the russians from </v>

2676
02:43:59.850 --> 02:44:02.401
<v Speaker 5>snapping up too much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this appeared to be the easy animal </v>

2677
02:44:02.401 --> 02:44:06.661
<v Speaker 5>in the herd to take down and a crucial </v>
<v Speaker 5>place that might have all sorts of </v>

2678
02:44:06.661 --> 02:44:08.020
<v Speaker 5>impact on the war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you did take him down,</v>

2679
02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:13.260
<v Speaker 5>take for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the countries that hadn't decided </v>

2680
02:44:13.260 --> 02:44:13.900
<v Speaker 5>whose side they were going to fight on.</v>

2681
02:44:13.900 --> 02:44:16.750
<v Speaker 5>Yet when Turkey enters the war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as we said,</v>

2682
02:44:17.110 --> 02:44:22.110
<v Speaker 5>it's a bit of a headache for the allies </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they opened up an entire new </v>

2683
02:44:22.110 --> 02:44:23.050
<v Speaker 5>theater of operations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

2684
02:44:23.051 --> 02:44:25.330
<v Speaker 5>There might've been a little stuff on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the side going on,</v>

2685
02:44:25.331 --> 02:44:27.400
<v Speaker 5>but when Turkey gets into the warren,</v>
<v Speaker 5>november 19,</v>

2686
02:44:27.401 --> 02:44:29.710
<v Speaker 5>14,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the middle east is now in play.</v>

2687
02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:33.220
<v Speaker 5>India may be in place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Southern russia's imply north africa and</v>

2688
02:44:33.221 --> 02:44:36.550
<v Speaker 5>Egypt in play.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The balkans is in play.</v>

2689
02:44:37.450 --> 02:44:42.160
<v Speaker 5>the balkans is territory that when the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ottoman turks were young and powerful,</v>

2690
02:44:42.370 --> 02:44:47.370
<v Speaker 5>they owned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they had fought two wars in the past </v>

2691
02:44:47.740 --> 02:44:52.740
<v Speaker 5>couple of years with the former </v>
<v Speaker 5>territories that they used to own and </v>

2692
02:44:52.740 --> 02:44:52.740
<v Speaker 5>watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2693
02:44:52.740 --> 02:44:54.850
<v Speaker 5>shake off the ottoman empire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Serbia,</v>

2694
02:44:54.851 --> 02:44:56.260
<v Speaker 5>Bulgaria,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Romania,</v>

2695
02:44:56.261 --> 02:45:01.261
<v Speaker 5>Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these places had been pulling </v>

2696
02:45:01.261 --> 02:45:02.881
<v Speaker 5>themselves away from autumn and </v>
<v Speaker 5>influence for some time now and none of </v>

2697
02:45:03.131 --> 02:45:06.490
<v Speaker 5>them had decided which side they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>gonna fight on in this war yet.</v>

2698
02:45:06.670 --> 02:45:11.670
<v Speaker 5>And It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you talk about watching open </v>

2699
02:45:11.670 --> 02:45:14.581
<v Speaker 5>diplomacy in a way that's like watching </v>
<v Speaker 5>horse trading going on is watching the </v>

2700
02:45:14.581 --> 02:45:19.081
<v Speaker 5>allies on one side and the central </v>
<v Speaker 5>powers on the other side try to convince</v>

2701
02:45:19.181 --> 02:45:21.880
<v Speaker 5>a country to go their way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean with Italy for example,</v>

2702
02:45:22.180 --> 02:45:27.180
<v Speaker 5>it's almost open auction time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean one alliance will walk in the </v>

2703
02:45:27.180 --> 02:45:27.580
<v Speaker 5>front door and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2704
02:45:27.581 --> 02:45:32.581
<v Speaker 5>if we win the war and you're joining us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can have this province from the </v>

2705
02:45:32.581 --> 02:45:32.581
<v Speaker 5>enemy in that province,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in that province do.</v>

2706
02:45:32.581 --> 02:45:32.650
<v Speaker 5>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll leave.</v>

2707
02:45:32.651 --> 02:45:34.600
<v Speaker 5>And then the other door comes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The other alliance system saying,</v>

2708
02:45:34.601 --> 02:45:35.710
<v Speaker 5>is that all they promised you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2709
02:45:35.711 --> 02:45:37.480
<v Speaker 5>if we could have this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that and the other thing,</v>

2710
02:45:37.960 --> 02:45:41.170
<v Speaker 5>and this was going on with all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>countries in the balkans,</v>

2711
02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:42.400
<v Speaker 5>Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

2712
02:45:42.401 --> 02:45:47.401
<v Speaker 5>in the aegean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the number two thing they were all </v>

2713
02:45:47.401 --> 02:45:47.401
<v Speaker 5>concerned with is what were they going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to get?</v>

2714
02:45:47.401 --> 02:45:49.360
<v Speaker 5>They got in the war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you promising me and you know,</v>

2715
02:45:49.390 --> 02:45:54.390
<v Speaker 5>going to the highest bidder,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the number one thing they were all </v>

2716
02:45:54.390 --> 02:45:57.571
<v Speaker 5>concerned with his who was gonna win.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These countries knew that they were </v>

2717
02:45:57.761 --> 02:46:00.910
<v Speaker 5>absolutely like roadkill if they pick </v>
<v Speaker 5>the wrong side,</v>

2718
02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:06.240
<v Speaker 5>but in early 1915,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no clearcut dominant side had emerged </v>

2719
02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:10.280
<v Speaker 5>and so churchill and his compatriots had</v>
<v Speaker 5>this idea</v>

2720
02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:15.280
<v Speaker 1>that they could strike a big blow in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that theater right in that part of the </v>

2721
02:46:15.280 --> 02:46:18.731
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if they did knock anybody out with </v>

2722
02:46:18.731 --> 02:46:18.731
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might convince a lot of these powers.</v>

2723
02:46:18.731 --> 02:46:20.270
<v Speaker 1>While you can see britain's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when France is going to win,</v>

2724
02:46:20.330 --> 02:46:21.410
<v Speaker 1>let's join them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2725
02:46:21.470 --> 02:46:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Changed the course of the war that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all these good arguments like this </v>

2726
02:46:26.470 --> 02:46:29.900
<v Speaker 1>are starting to accrue for this cabal of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like winston churchill.</v>

2727
02:46:30.260 --> 02:46:35.260
<v Speaker 1>When all of a sudden something </v>
<v Speaker 1>intervenes to bring the whole thing to </v>

2728
02:46:35.260 --> 02:46:38.261
<v Speaker 1>ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it on the front burner and make the </v>

2729
02:46:38.261 --> 02:46:38.960
<v Speaker 1>government consider whether or not it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a good idea.</v>

2730
02:46:38.990 --> 02:46:41.960
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing to have a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's another thing to really be thinking</v>

2731
02:46:41.961 --> 02:46:42.350
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2732
02:46:42.351 --> 02:46:47.351
<v Speaker 1>is this What we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a request from the russians changes </v>

2733
02:46:47.351 --> 02:46:48.230
<v Speaker 1>this from a theoretical question to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're debating.</v>

2734
02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:52.100
<v Speaker 1>In early january of 1915,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the russians are asking for help.</v>

2735
02:46:53.230 --> 02:46:56.080
<v Speaker 1>they are facing the turks down near </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2736
02:46:56.460 --> 02:47:01.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>border the church and the russian </v>

2737
02:47:01.460 --> 02:47:03.760
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>touch but far away from where russian </v>

2738
02:47:03.760 --> 02:47:07.451
<v Speaker 1>forces are fighting the germans and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>austra hungarians because of the </v>

2739
02:47:07.451 --> 02:47:09.110
<v Speaker 1>distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the russians had pretty much taken their</v>

2740
02:47:09.111 --> 02:47:14.111
<v Speaker 1>troops and they're fighting for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives against the germans and use them </v>

2741
02:47:14.111 --> 02:47:16.570
<v Speaker 1>up north and now the turks are attacking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and strength down south.</v>

2742
02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:19.970
<v Speaker 1>The situation will get critical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In late december,</v>

2743
02:47:19.971 --> 02:47:24.971
<v Speaker 1>went on December 29th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the turkish forces up against the </v>

2744
02:47:24.971 --> 02:47:28.391
<v Speaker 1>russians on their mutual border,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start the battle of sarah calmness and </v>

2745
02:47:28.391 --> 02:47:31.760
<v Speaker 1>try to attack the russian defenders from</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple sides at once.</v>

2746
02:47:31.761 --> 02:47:36.761
<v Speaker 1>It's a very optimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very napoleonic in concept plan led by a</v>

2747
02:47:38.151 --> 02:47:42.550
<v Speaker 1>civilian strategist actually who will </v>
<v Speaker 1>take $120,000</v>

2748
02:47:42.551 --> 02:47:47.551
<v Speaker 1>on a good turkish army and ruin it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in this battle because these </v>

2749
02:47:48.901 --> 02:47:52.380
<v Speaker 1>russians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a smaller force than the turks attacking</v>

2750
02:47:52.381 --> 02:47:57.381
<v Speaker 1>them are ensconced in the natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortress that is the caucasus mountain </v>

2751
02:47:57.381 --> 02:47:59.820
<v Speaker 1>range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the middle of winter,</v>

2752
02:48:01.110 --> 02:48:04.350
<v Speaker 1>all this fighting is going to happen at </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevations between 5,000</v>

2753
02:48:04.351 --> 02:48:05.940
<v Speaker 1>feet and 6,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

2754
02:48:06.450 --> 02:48:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Turkish soldiers are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting as though they're dressed for </v>

2755
02:48:11.450 --> 02:48:14.550
<v Speaker 1>the low lands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The logistics of this hundred and 20,000</v>

2756
02:48:14.551 --> 02:48:19.551
<v Speaker 1>man army are going to be carried up into</v>
<v Speaker 1>these mountains on tiny little windy </v>

2757
02:48:19.551 --> 02:48:23.391
<v Speaker 1>mountain roads and there's not even many</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them and it's snowing like you can't </v>

2758
02:48:23.391 --> 02:48:23.580
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're told,</v>

2759
02:48:23.581 --> 02:48:27.900
<v Speaker 1>have you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple days of 14 our marches through,</v>

2760
02:48:28.170 --> 02:48:29.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waist deep snow.</v>

2761
02:48:29.701 --> 02:48:34.701
<v Speaker 1>By the time these poor turkish troops </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to the russians there darn near </v>

2762
02:48:34.701 --> 02:48:37.490
<v Speaker 1>defeated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then some of them surrender right away.</v>

2763
02:48:37.500 --> 02:48:40.560
<v Speaker 1>May several cores just surrender that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you just get this image of these</v>

2764
02:48:40.561 --> 02:48:41.970
<v Speaker 1>starving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2765
02:48:41.990 --> 02:48:44.880
<v Speaker 1>units that are just falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the end of their rope,</v>

2766
02:48:45.210 --> 02:48:48.120
<v Speaker 1>some fight bravely and almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>fanatically anyway.</v>

2767
02:48:48.330 --> 02:48:53.330
<v Speaker 1>And then the next part of the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's famous is the retreat of this </v>

2768
02:48:53.330 --> 02:48:53.880
<v Speaker 1>turkish army back to Turkey.</v>

2769
02:48:53.880 --> 02:48:58.880
<v Speaker 1>They lose about half their strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're told that of the people that do </v>

2770
02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:03.741
<v Speaker 1>make it back to Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a third of them are so badly wounded </v>

2771
02:49:03.741 --> 02:49:06.261
<v Speaker 1>that they'll have some part of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>body amputated and the stories </v>

2772
02:49:06.261 --> 02:49:09.300
<v Speaker 1>themselves and it's amazing alike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are booked a book,</v>

2773
02:49:09.660 --> 02:49:12.270
<v Speaker 1>but they they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They create this sort of mental image of</v>

2774
02:49:12.271 --> 02:49:15.570
<v Speaker 1>like napoleon retreating from moscow in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the winter.</v>

2775
02:49:15.571 --> 02:49:20.571
<v Speaker 1>Harry did the whole way back with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers that were freezing on the march</v>

2776
02:49:21.631 --> 02:49:26.631
<v Speaker 1>because it was so cold and the mountain </v>
<v Speaker 1>passes in the middle of winter and the </v>

2777
02:49:26.631 --> 02:49:29.580
<v Speaker 1>army is supposed to be followed by packs</v>
<v Speaker 1>of wolves through these,</v>

2778
02:49:29.880 --> 02:49:31.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost bram stoker ish,</v>

2779
02:49:31.651 --> 02:49:36.651
<v Speaker 1>like terrain and taking the frozen </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers as they freeze or as they </v>

2780
02:49:36.651 --> 02:49:39.660
<v Speaker 1>become too wounded to defend themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrifying story.</v>

2781
02:49:39.661 --> 02:49:43.020
<v Speaker 1>And the turks will be very bitter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>affected by this battle.</v>

2782
02:49:43.500 --> 02:49:48.500
<v Speaker 1>The russians will be though too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because even though they technically </v>

2783
02:49:48.500 --> 02:49:49.290
<v Speaker 1>when it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all they know,</v>

2784
02:49:49.291 --> 02:49:54.291
<v Speaker 1>the turks could do this in another three</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks or another month and they're not </v>

2785
02:49:54.291 --> 02:49:54.291
<v Speaker 1>ready for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2786
02:49:54.291 --> 02:49:58.850
<v Speaker 1>the turkish attack down here prove that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a quiet safe front and you </v>

2787
02:49:58.850 --> 02:50:01.710
<v Speaker 1>better be ready for more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not ready for more.</v>

2788
02:50:02.130 --> 02:50:03.510
<v Speaker 1>This is why they asked for help</v>

2789
02:50:04.830 --> 02:50:09.830
<v Speaker 1>and they asked for some diversion to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>made that will draw some of these </v>

2790
02:50:09.830 --> 02:50:13.161
<v Speaker 1>turkish troops away from them and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that will open up the supply </v>

2791
02:50:14.431 --> 02:50:19.431
<v Speaker 1>lines again beCause the turks control </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most strategically important </v>

2792
02:50:19.431 --> 02:50:21.270
<v Speaker 1>spots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just in the world,</v>

2793
02:50:21.271 --> 02:50:25.830
<v Speaker 1>but in world history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you take constantinople in the 15th</v>

2794
02:50:25.831 --> 02:50:27.390
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the turks did,</v>

2795
02:50:28.050 --> 02:50:33.050
<v Speaker 1>the dardanelles come with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dardanelles are the actual </v>

2796
02:50:33.050 --> 02:50:37.911
<v Speaker 1>separation and this is a geographic </v>
<v Speaker 1>feature that goes back to forever </v>

2797
02:50:38.010 --> 02:50:42.780
<v Speaker 1>between asia and europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at it on satellite images,</v>

2798
02:50:42.781 --> 02:50:44.770
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a rather large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2799
02:50:44.870 --> 02:50:49.870
<v Speaker 1>river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really is only a mile apart in </v>

2800
02:50:49.870 --> 02:50:53.031
<v Speaker 1>some spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the waterway that takes you </v>

2801
02:50:53.031 --> 02:50:53.031
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2802
02:50:53.031 --> 02:50:57.741
<v Speaker 1>the g and c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is connected to the mediterranean </v>

2803
02:50:57.741 --> 02:51:00.801
<v Speaker 1>sea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is connected to the rest of the </v>

2804
02:51:00.801 --> 02:51:01.770
<v Speaker 1>world and get you from there to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>black sea,</v>

2805
02:51:02.100 --> 02:51:07.100
<v Speaker 1>which is not connected to the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world unless you're using the </v>

2806
02:51:07.100 --> 02:51:07.100
<v Speaker 1>dardanelles.</v>

2807
02:51:07.100 --> 02:51:10.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a straight of extreme importance </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the turks control it.</v>

2808
02:51:11.280 --> 02:51:15.450
<v Speaker 1>They have fortresses on both sides of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this glorified river with canon.</v>

2809
02:51:15.840 --> 02:51:20.040
<v Speaker 1>they've got mines in the waterway to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent people from getting through that</v>

2810
02:51:20.041 --> 02:51:25.041
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to get through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once they get in the War in </v>

2811
02:51:25.041 --> 02:51:25.041
<v Speaker 1>november,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

2812
02:51:25.041 --> 02:51:27.591
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want the russians to get </v>

2813
02:51:27.591 --> 02:51:29.451
<v Speaker 1>through and they don't want the british </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get through and the french to get </v>

2814
02:51:29.451 --> 02:51:32.301
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a huge problem for Russia </v>

2815
02:51:32.301 --> 02:51:32.400
<v Speaker 1>because they don't have a lot of places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2816
02:51:32.650 --> 02:51:35.550
<v Speaker 1>where people can trade with them via the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean.</v>

2817
02:51:35.640 --> 02:51:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2818
02:51:37.051 --> 02:51:40.950
<v Speaker 1>if it's anywhere near the winter months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's near the winter months,</v>

2819
02:51:41.250 --> 02:51:46.250
<v Speaker 1>you need this port open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the black sea port open and now the </v>

2820
02:51:46.250 --> 02:51:48.180
<v Speaker 1>turks have closed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The russians are in such bad straights.</v>

2821
02:51:48.570 --> 02:51:53.570
<v Speaker 1>They are sending soldiers into battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a rifle and then another soldier </v>

2822
02:51:54.721 --> 02:51:58.620
<v Speaker 1>whose job it is to shadow the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldier and when the first soldier dies,</v>

2823
02:51:58.621 --> 02:52:01.590
<v Speaker 1>pick up his rifle and use it because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>second person didn't get a rifle.</v>

2824
02:52:03.920 --> 02:52:08.920
<v Speaker 1>The russian industry keep up with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>military needs and so they're having </v>

2825
02:52:08.920 --> 02:52:12.631
<v Speaker 1>problems like that so you can see how </v>
<v Speaker 1>important it is for them to be able to </v>

2826
02:52:12.631 --> 02:52:15.961
<v Speaker 1>trade with britain and France and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside powers if just to get rifles to </v>

2827
02:52:15.961 --> 02:52:20.940
<v Speaker 1>arm their troops with and now the turks </v>
<v Speaker 1>have closed off that important area and </v>

2828
02:52:20.940 --> 02:52:22.150
<v Speaker 1>winston churchill thinks he can open it.</v>

2829
02:52:23.560 --> 02:52:27.250
<v Speaker 1>He gets an idea that will involve any </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground troops at all.</v>

2830
02:52:27.251 --> 02:52:28.870
<v Speaker 1>He continually points this out in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

2831
02:52:28.871 --> 02:52:31.990
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've used this book for this show,</v>

2832
02:52:31.991 --> 02:52:36.991
<v Speaker 1>but not as a history book because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the kind of book you want to use to </v>

2833
02:52:36.991 --> 02:52:40.321
<v Speaker 1>find historical truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the kind of book you want to look </v>

2834
02:52:40.321 --> 02:52:41.810
<v Speaker 1>to find the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As churchill saw it,</v>

2835
02:52:41.860 --> 02:52:44.470
<v Speaker 1>unjustified it afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very different thing.</v>

2836
02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Churchill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fingerprints are all over this thing</v>

2837
02:52:47.421 --> 02:52:49.550
<v Speaker 1>and this thing is going to go south </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast,</v>

2838
02:52:50.260 --> 02:52:55.260
<v Speaker 1>and so in churchill's book he does with </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost any other person with any </v>

2839
02:52:55.260 --> 02:52:57.250
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for world war one does in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their post war memoirs,</v>

2840
02:52:58.030 --> 02:53:00.460
<v Speaker 1>he defends himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>answers his critics,</v>

2841
02:53:00.490 --> 02:53:02.320
<v Speaker 1>justifies this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explains that,</v>

2842
02:53:02.321 --> 02:53:05.870
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be no different than the german generals</v>

2843
02:53:05.871 --> 02:53:10.871
<v Speaker 1>and whatnot in that respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But his point is when he thought of this</v>

2844
02:53:11.141 --> 02:53:16.141
<v Speaker 1>idea it didn't involve any land troops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and since land troops are going to be a </v>

2845
02:53:16.141 --> 02:53:17.680
<v Speaker 1>huge part of the tragedy that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfolds into,</v>

2846
02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:20.350
<v Speaker 1>he basically says he washed his hands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole plan.</v>

2847
02:53:20.351 --> 02:53:25.351
<v Speaker 1>Once that situation changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>churchill's plan was to take the </v>

2848
02:53:25.351 --> 02:53:30.031
<v Speaker 1>largest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most powerful fleet ever assembled in </v>

2849
02:53:30.031 --> 02:53:30.460
<v Speaker 1>world history and forced the streets</v>

2850
02:53:31.510 --> 02:53:35.700
<v Speaker 1>simply sail through him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wiping out any fort,</v>

2851
02:53:35.860 --> 02:53:40.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's anywhere nearby with naval </v>

2852
02:53:40.860 --> 02:53:40.860
<v Speaker 1>gunfire and go from one side to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

2853
02:53:40.860 --> 02:53:45.510
<v Speaker 1>And then once you're on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right next to formerly </v>

2854
02:53:45.510 --> 02:53:45.820
<v Speaker 1>constantinople.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now istanbul,</v>

2855
02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:51.000
<v Speaker 1>and you have a giant megalopolis </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath the guns of the greatest </v>

2856
02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:55.621
<v Speaker 1>fleet ever assembled and sent to war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an idea that looks great on paper</v>

2857
02:53:58.100 --> 02:54:02.990
<v Speaker 1>and then by the time events go from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way through the alphabet to z,</v>

2858
02:54:02.991 --> 02:54:07.991
<v Speaker 1>though you see who rules the alphabet </v>
<v Speaker 1>between a to z when it comes to getting </v>

2859
02:54:08.121 --> 02:54:13.121
<v Speaker 1>something from the theoretical stage to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality stage and that's murphy's </v>

2860
02:54:13.121 --> 02:54:17.321
<v Speaker 1>law and murphy's law grabs hold of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>events and Quickly turns this whole </v>

2861
02:54:17.601 --> 02:54:21.800
<v Speaker 1>affair into something that no one had </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever thought was the right thing to do.</v>

2862
02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Shows you how people can get swamped by </v>
<v Speaker 1>events sometimes and churchill spends a </v>

2863
02:54:27.400 --> 02:54:31.571
<v Speaker 1>good part of his book on this subject </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to point out that he was one of </v>

2864
02:54:31.571 --> 02:54:35.711
<v Speaker 1>the victims of what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's often been portrayed as the </v>

2865
02:54:36.071 --> 02:54:36.880
<v Speaker 1>architect</v>

2866
02:54:38.650 --> 02:54:43.650
<v Speaker 1>and if you ever want to see how </v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrating history can be some times </v>

2867
02:54:43.650 --> 02:54:46.240
<v Speaker 1>look at churchill's thinking on all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you examine it,</v>

2868
02:54:46.270 --> 02:54:51.270
<v Speaker 1>it's so logical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing exactly what any of us would </v>

2869
02:54:51.270 --> 02:54:54.751
<v Speaker 1>hope somebody in a position of power </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do in terms of going down the </v>

2870
02:54:54.751 --> 02:54:56.440
<v Speaker 1>arguments and the risks and benefits </v>
<v Speaker 1>logically,</v>

2871
02:54:56.860 --> 02:55:01.860
<v Speaker 1>and it still turns out horribly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sort of lesson is that teaching to </v>

2872
02:55:01.860 --> 02:55:03.470
<v Speaker 1>the other commanders who were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2873
02:55:03.490 --> 02:55:08.490
<v Speaker 1>just keep smashing against the wall or </v>
<v Speaker 1>my goodness doesn't seem to matter </v>

2874
02:55:08.490 --> 02:55:12.911
<v Speaker 1>whether you think outside the box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do the same darn stupid pointless </v>

2875
02:55:12.911 --> 02:55:16.751
<v Speaker 1>thing again and again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first world war equalizes the </v>

2876
02:55:16.751 --> 02:55:17.780
<v Speaker 1>results of both of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a.</v>

2877
02:55:17.781 --> 02:55:22.010
<v Speaker 1>You're darned if you thinking you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>darned if you don't think churchill.</v>

2878
02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Basic assumption was that the british </v>
<v Speaker 1>empire was sitting on an enormously </v>

2879
02:55:27.070 --> 02:55:31.091
<v Speaker 1>powerful fleet that was useless and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>part that was useless is so useless you </v>

2880
02:55:31.751 --> 02:55:34.930
<v Speaker 1>can't even use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the enemy fleet comes out to fight,</v>

2881
02:55:34.931 --> 02:55:39.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole bunch of british ships </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were made obsolete only in 19.</v>

2882
02:55:39.101 --> 02:55:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember it's 19,</v>

2883
02:55:40.751 --> 02:55:42.010
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1915.</v>

2884
02:55:42.580 --> 02:55:43.930
<v Speaker 1>What happened in 19?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh six.</v>

2885
02:55:44.290 --> 02:55:47.050
<v Speaker 1>A brand new type of battleship arrived </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the scene,</v>

2886
02:55:47.500 --> 02:55:48.910
<v Speaker 1>became the name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2887
02:55:48.911 --> 02:55:53.911
<v Speaker 1>the initial ship's name was dreadnought </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that becomes the name for that </v>

2888
02:55:53.911 --> 02:55:54.520
<v Speaker 1>entire type of vessel,</v>

2889
02:55:55.450 --> 02:55:58.360
<v Speaker 1>a dreadnought or super dreadnought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a class name now,</v>

2890
02:55:58.361 --> 02:56:00.880
<v Speaker 1>and that's because that's how </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary this ship was.</v>

2891
02:56:01.420 --> 02:56:06.420
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the instantly it arrives on the </v>

2892
02:56:06.420 --> 02:56:09.301
<v Speaker 1>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes obsolete fleets of hugely </v>

2893
02:56:09.301 --> 02:56:13.291
<v Speaker 1>expensive vessels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dozens and dozens and dozens of them </v>

2894
02:56:13.291 --> 02:56:14.290
<v Speaker 1>that have been built up over a lifetime </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes them obsolete overnight,</v>

2895
02:56:15.370 --> 02:56:17.320
<v Speaker 1>and of course the british being the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest navy in the world.</v>

2896
02:56:17.321 --> 02:56:21.250
<v Speaker 1>They had the most of these battleships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the older battleships,</v>

2897
02:56:21.430 --> 02:56:23.080
<v Speaker 1>the ones that in 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2898
02:56:23.081 --> 02:56:25.720
<v Speaker 1>five or the greatest force of float and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 19,</v>

2899
02:56:25.721 --> 02:56:27.820
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six are ready for the scrap heap,</v>

2900
02:56:28.940 --> 02:56:31.420
<v Speaker 1>and that's what churchill said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these ships were heading for.</v>

2901
02:56:31.540 --> 02:56:36.540
<v Speaker 1>What are we saving them for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just going to be scrapped after </v>

2902
02:56:36.540 --> 02:56:37.390
<v Speaker 1>the war and he says that the admiral's </v>
<v Speaker 1>had these emotional attachments to these</v>

2903
02:56:37.391 --> 02:56:42.391
<v Speaker 1>ships because they had served on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>more they remembered the day when these </v>

2904
02:56:42.391 --> 02:56:45.661
<v Speaker 1>were the most powerful war ships afloat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and churchill's attitude is these are </v>

2905
02:56:45.661 --> 02:56:46.060
<v Speaker 1>assets to be used up for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>AGain,</v>

2906
02:56:46.300 --> 02:56:48.340
<v Speaker 1>we can use them in the dardanelles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>if we lose them,</v>

2907
02:56:48.370 --> 02:56:52.890
<v Speaker 1>we don't lose anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's got a lot of them.</v>

2908
02:56:54.740 --> 02:56:59.740
<v Speaker 1>winston churchill's plan of using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fleet in a lightening attack that the </v>

2909
02:56:59.740 --> 02:57:01.570
<v Speaker 1>turks weren't ready for with massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest.</v>

2910
02:57:01.571 --> 02:57:06.571
<v Speaker 1>I could just force the straights before </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone could respond to it turns into </v>

2911
02:57:06.571 --> 02:57:10.250
<v Speaker 1>something totally different over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next several weeks,</v>

2912
02:57:10.970 --> 02:57:15.970
<v Speaker 1>and churchill has always claimed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the events were completely out of his </v>

2913
02:57:15.970 --> 02:57:18.350
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he uses as an argument the line that</v>

2914
02:57:18.351 --> 02:57:20.900
<v Speaker 1>he was told that there were no troops </v>
<v Speaker 1>available,</v>

2915
02:57:20.901 --> 02:57:25.901
<v Speaker 1>so any plan he came up with pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to have a tiny little group of </v>

2916
02:57:25.901 --> 02:57:27.530
<v Speaker 1>marines to run on shore and knock out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun if necessary,</v>

2917
02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:32.680
<v Speaker 1>but nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he says basically he can't be </v>

2918
02:57:32.680 --> 02:57:32.750
<v Speaker 1>responsible for this land disaster </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about to happen.</v>

2919
02:57:32.990 --> 02:57:34.640
<v Speaker 1>He never assumed there'd be any troops </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

2920
02:57:34.641 --> 02:57:38.150
<v Speaker 1>and here's what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quote at the evening meeting of the war,</v>

2921
02:57:38.151 --> 02:57:42.830
<v Speaker 1>counsel on January 28th when the final </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision to adopt the plan was taken,</v>

2922
02:57:43.010 --> 02:57:44.780
<v Speaker 1>lord kitchener,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeated quote,</v>

2923
02:57:44.990 --> 02:57:47.300
<v Speaker 1>we have at present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no troops despair.</v>

2924
02:57:47.480 --> 02:57:51.890
<v Speaker 1>It was on that foundation alone that all</v>
<v Speaker 1>our decisions in favor of a purely naval</v>

2925
02:57:51.891 --> 02:57:56.891
<v Speaker 1>attack had been taken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hence forward a series of new facts </v>

2926
02:57:56.891 --> 02:57:59.060
<v Speaker 1>and pressures came into play which </v>
<v Speaker 1>gradually,</v>

2927
02:57:59.240 --> 02:58:04.240
<v Speaker 1>but unceasingly changed the and </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormously extended the scale of the </v>

2928
02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:07.350
<v Speaker 1>enterprise under these influences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In less than two months,</v>

2929
02:58:07.380 --> 02:58:10.050
<v Speaker 1>the naval attack with its lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainty,</v>

2930
02:58:10.140 --> 02:58:15.020
<v Speaker 1>but with its limited costs and risks </v>
<v Speaker 1>became subsidiary and in its place there</v>

2931
02:58:15.021 --> 02:58:19.380
<v Speaker 1>are rows and military development of </v>
<v Speaker 1>great magnitude over this new plan.</v>

2932
02:58:19.381 --> 02:58:21.930
<v Speaker 1>The admiralty had no responsible </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

2933
02:58:22.110 --> 02:58:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Our advice did not prevail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are criticisms were not welcomed and </v>

2934
02:58:27.110 --> 02:58:29.250
<v Speaker 1>even inquiries became a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>delicacy intact.</v>

2935
02:58:29.580 --> 02:58:34.580
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the results of this military </v>

2936
02:58:34.580 --> 02:58:35.780
<v Speaker 1>operation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had to stand or fall and quote,</v>

2937
02:58:36.300 --> 02:58:38.340
<v Speaker 1>I know you don't need translation for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

2938
02:58:38.490 --> 02:58:40.380
<v Speaker 1>but isn't that the same as saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2939
02:58:40.381 --> 02:58:42.150
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't my idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You changed it,</v>

2940
02:58:42.151 --> 02:58:44.010
<v Speaker 1>but I still have to be responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2941
02:58:45.030 --> 02:58:47.880
<v Speaker 1>You see a lot of post world war one </v>
<v Speaker 1>memoirs that sound like that.</v>

2942
02:58:48.330 --> 02:58:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it adequately explains how out of </v>

2943
02:58:53.330 --> 02:58:56.451
<v Speaker 1>control the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seeing once churchill and his cabal had </v>

2944
02:58:56.451 --> 02:58:59.280
<v Speaker 1>taken their little private idea and had </v>
<v Speaker 1>it adopted by not just one government,</v>

2945
02:58:59.281 --> 02:59:03.690
<v Speaker 1>but the allies as the plan and of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the final analysis,</v>

2946
02:59:04.110 --> 02:59:07.140
<v Speaker 1>the people with the most control over </v>
<v Speaker 1>your plan.</v>

2947
02:59:07.200 --> 02:59:12.200
<v Speaker 1>If you're winston churchill or the ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the scene who actually have to make </v>

2948
02:59:12.200 --> 02:59:15.000
<v Speaker 1>it work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The military commanders in this case,</v>

2949
02:59:15.001 --> 02:59:20.001
<v Speaker 1>the admiral's on February 17th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of those admirals are leading </v>

2950
02:59:21.631 --> 02:59:24.390
<v Speaker 1>the most powerful fleet that's ever gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>to war.</v>

2951
02:59:25.740 --> 02:59:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Now I say that as sort of leaving a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little loophole because the most </v>

2952
02:59:30.740 --> 02:59:32.520
<v Speaker 1>powerful fleet in the world is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>british fleet sitting up in scapa,</v>

2953
02:59:32.521 --> 02:59:35.760
<v Speaker 1>flow up in scotland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for the german fleet to come out</v>

2954
02:59:35.761 --> 02:59:38.730
<v Speaker 1>and play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that leads never done anything.</v>

2955
02:59:39.060 --> 02:59:44.060
<v Speaker 1>They're waiting for their chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The largest most powerful fleet that's </v>

2956
02:59:44.060 --> 02:59:44.670
<v Speaker 1>ever gone to war and tried to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something so far.</v>

2957
02:59:44.850 --> 02:59:47.880
<v Speaker 1>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 or so battleships,</v>

2958
02:59:47.881 --> 02:59:49.500
<v Speaker 1>most of them british,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them french.</v>

2959
02:59:50.370 --> 02:59:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Most of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old battleships that were made </v>

2960
02:59:55.370 --> 02:59:55.470
<v Speaker 1>obsolete a decade before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also including,</v>

2961
02:59:55.580 --> 02:59:57.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the newest super dreadnought,</v>

2962
02:59:57.150 --> 03:00:00.450
<v Speaker 1>the queen elizabeth with 15 inch guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2963
03:00:00.451 --> 03:00:02.820
<v Speaker 1>12 or so cruisers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 destroyers,</v>

2964
03:00:02.821 --> 03:00:07.821
<v Speaker 1>a couple hundred transports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fleet might not have lasted very </v>

2965
03:00:07.821 --> 03:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>long against the crack in the german </v>
<v Speaker 1>fleet,</v>

2966
03:00:10.320 --> 03:00:15.320
<v Speaker 1>but in this part of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the most powerful force afloat and </v>

2967
03:00:15.360 --> 03:00:19.110
<v Speaker 1>would have been the greatest athlete in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world a decade before it arrives.</v>

2968
03:00:19.170 --> 03:00:24.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the coast of Turkey and begins </v>

2969
03:00:24.170 --> 03:00:26.150
<v Speaker 1>shelling those straits on February 19th </v>
<v Speaker 1>and things start slowing down.</v>

2970
03:00:28.890 --> 03:00:33.890
<v Speaker 1>The plan is to batter your way through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy all these fortresses as you </v>

2971
03:00:33.890 --> 03:00:37.101
<v Speaker 1>continue to move deeper and deeper into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of river like piece of </v>

2972
03:00:37.101 --> 03:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>geography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know the weather gets bad,</v>

2973
03:00:38.281 --> 03:00:39.760
<v Speaker 1>so the fleet retreats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2974
03:00:39.780 --> 03:00:44.780
<v Speaker 1>to a safe distance and then it comes up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they shell some force and then </v>

2975
03:00:44.780 --> 03:00:45.960
<v Speaker 1>something else goes wrong and churchill </v>
<v Speaker 1>is sitting back in britain going crazy.</v>

2976
03:00:45.960 --> 03:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>PullIng his hair out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sending messages after message is </v>

2977
03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>basically saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurry,</v>

2978
03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>hurry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurry.</v>

2979
03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:54.360
<v Speaker 1>The whole plan requires you to hurry </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the longer they take,</v>

2980
03:00:54.690 --> 03:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>the more you lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole idea that there's some </v>

2981
03:00:59.690 --> 03:01:02.031
<v Speaker 1>surprise to it that catches the turks </v>
<v Speaker 1>off guard and so the turks have already </v>

2982
03:01:02.031 --> 03:01:04.150
<v Speaker 1>figured out when you see the largest </v>
<v Speaker 1>fleet that had ever gone to war,</v>

2983
03:01:04.690 --> 03:01:09.690
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the british are doing something down </v>

2984
03:01:09.690 --> 03:01:11.521
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good news is that does take away </v>

2985
03:01:11.521 --> 03:01:11.521
<v Speaker 1>troops fighting the russians and take </v>
<v Speaker 1>some pressure off the tsar,</v>

2986
03:01:11.521 --> 03:01:14.290
<v Speaker 1>which was the reason he asked for help </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first place.</v>

2987
03:01:14.590 --> 03:01:19.070
<v Speaker 1>The bad news is instead of the british </v>
<v Speaker 1>advancing against a totally unready foe,</v>

2988
03:01:19.250 --> 03:01:21.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and taking advantage of surprise,</v>

2989
03:01:21.340 --> 03:01:26.340
<v Speaker 1>they're sitting there giving the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>basic idea way for months on the 18th of</v>

2990
03:01:29.110 --> 03:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>March,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fleet decides to try again in a big </v>

2991
03:01:34.110 --> 03:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill's back there,</v>

2992
03:01:34.110 --> 03:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>prodding them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to work,</v>

2993
03:01:34.110 --> 03:01:34.560
<v Speaker 1>get out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>

2994
03:01:34.561 --> 03:01:39.561
<v Speaker 1>big attack and the 18 battleships and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole fleet goes in and start </v>

2995
03:01:39.561 --> 03:01:39.561
<v Speaker 1>shelling the forts.</v>

2996
03:01:39.561 --> 03:01:44.240
<v Speaker 1>Some marines are detached and send on </v>
<v Speaker 1>land to go take some of these sports </v>

2997
03:01:44.240 --> 03:01:47.650
<v Speaker 1>that are particularly troublesome and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then shit hits a mine.</v>

2998
03:01:48.060 --> 03:01:51.910
<v Speaker 1>A french battleship rolls over really </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

2999
03:01:51.911 --> 03:01:53.710
<v Speaker 1>About 700 people die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

3000
03:01:53.830 --> 03:01:57.640
<v Speaker 1>fast before anyone's had time to digest </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3001
03:01:58.150 --> 03:02:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Another one hits a mine and then another</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

3002
03:02:01.031 --> 03:02:03.580
<v Speaker 1>and by the way on the scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know that these are mines.</v>

3003
03:02:03.581 --> 03:02:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Mines are one of the things they thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>about torpedoes or another.</v>

3004
03:02:06.190 --> 03:02:08.560
<v Speaker 1>All they know is big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive,</v>

3005
03:02:08.561 --> 03:02:11.260
<v Speaker 1>important ships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in the old days,</v>

3006
03:02:11.680 --> 03:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>are starting to sink and list and </v>
<v Speaker 1>explode and the commander is pull </v>

3007
03:02:16.680 --> 03:02:20.730
<v Speaker 1>everything back and by the time they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from the streets they've lost or </v>

3008
03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:26.040
<v Speaker 1>seeing crippled six battleships now what</v>
<v Speaker 1>winston churchill would say and what he </v>

3009
03:02:26.651 --> 03:02:28.450
<v Speaker 1>did say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

3010
03:02:28.960 --> 03:02:32.530
<v Speaker 1>These are old battleship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not of any use to us at all,</v>

3011
03:02:32.650 --> 03:02:35.440
<v Speaker 1>so use them to take the straits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least take the streets.</v>

3012
03:02:35.590 --> 03:02:37.840
<v Speaker 1>He said the admiral's had a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>different opinion.</v>

3013
03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:41.110
<v Speaker 1>They didn't see this as an asset to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>used.</v>

3014
03:02:41.260 --> 03:02:45.850
<v Speaker 1>They saw it as a charge to protect these</v>
<v Speaker 1>admirals.</v>

3015
03:02:45.851 --> 03:02:50.851
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had an emotional attachment to these </v>

3016
03:02:50.851 --> 03:02:52.551
<v Speaker 1>ships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They walked their decks back when they </v>

3017
03:02:52.551 --> 03:02:53.890
<v Speaker 1>were young officers in these ships were </v>
<v Speaker 1>the queens of the seas and he says,</v>

3018
03:02:53.891 --> 03:02:56.710
<v Speaker 1>now they had this attachment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to lose them,</v>

3019
03:02:56.830 --> 03:02:59.750
<v Speaker 1>and the whole point was they were there </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were losing a bowl.</v>

3020
03:03:00.610 --> 03:03:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's so terrible about what follows is</v>

3021
03:03:02.921 --> 03:03:07.921
<v Speaker 1>churchill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his attitude was that this fleet was </v>

3022
03:03:07.921 --> 03:03:09.571
<v Speaker 1>totally expendable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in order to protect this expendable </v>

3023
03:03:09.571 --> 03:03:13.141
<v Speaker 1>fleet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the high command decides the ground </v>

3024
03:03:13.141 --> 03:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>troops had to be sent in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pulled the fleet back.</v>

3025
03:03:13.510 --> 03:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>They begin assembling these 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>men that they're going to attack.</v>

3026
03:03:17.350 --> 03:03:22.350
<v Speaker 1>This area within.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The plan is to overwhelm this peninsula </v>

3027
03:03:22.350 --> 03:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>called the gallipoli peninsula.</v>

3028
03:03:22.990 --> 03:03:26.520
<v Speaker 1>That's right next to the dardanelles and</v>
<v Speaker 1>take over all those fortune,</v>

3029
03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>all those gun positions with your ground</v>
<v Speaker 1>troops.</v>

3030
03:03:29.470 --> 03:03:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Then those guns won't fire on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>little teeny minesweepers who are </v>

3031
03:03:34.470 --> 03:03:38.190
<v Speaker 1>clearing the streets of the mines and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then your big battleships won't get </v>

3032
03:03:38.190 --> 03:03:41.881
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the tail wagging the dog here </v>

3033
03:03:41.881 --> 03:03:46.440
<v Speaker 1>and churchill and others have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever since the war was over that this </v>

3034
03:03:46.440 --> 03:03:49.921
<v Speaker 1>was a disaster waiting to happen because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole point of this plan is to use </v>

3035
03:03:49.921 --> 03:03:52.270
<v Speaker 1>strategic surprise to catch the enemy </v>
<v Speaker 1>off guard.</v>

3036
03:03:52.390 --> 03:03:57.200
<v Speaker 1>How's the going to be going to be caught</v>
<v Speaker 1>off guard when it takes five weeks after</v>

3037
03:03:57.201 --> 03:03:58.090
<v Speaker 1>the battleships pull</v>

3038
03:03:58.090 --> 03:04:00.950
<v Speaker 5>back to get the ground forces onto the </v>
<v Speaker 5>beaches?</v>

3039
03:04:02.300 --> 03:04:04.700
<v Speaker 5>The turks are commanded by a german </v>
<v Speaker 5>general.</v>

3040
03:04:04.701 --> 03:04:09.701
<v Speaker 5>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a very competent guiding liman von </v>

3041
03:04:09.701 --> 03:04:13.451
<v Speaker 5>sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who supposedly says if the allies will </v>

3042
03:04:13.451 --> 03:04:14.030
<v Speaker 5>just give him eight days,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he can put together a defense.</v>

3043
03:04:14.031 --> 03:04:15.500
<v Speaker 5>He's desperate for time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eight days,</v>

3044
03:04:15.501 --> 03:04:19.400
<v Speaker 5>just give me eight days.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They gave him five weeks and by the time</v>

3045
03:04:19.401 --> 03:04:22.370
<v Speaker 5>the landings take place in late april,</v>
<v Speaker 5>early may,</v>

3046
03:04:22.371 --> 03:04:23.390
<v Speaker 5>19,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15,</v>

3047
03:04:24.350 --> 03:04:27.770
<v Speaker 5>to say that the turks are ready,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe is a little bit presumptuous,</v>

3048
03:04:28.400 --> 03:04:33.400
<v Speaker 5>but they're waiting and you get a chance</v>
<v Speaker 5>to see what the worst nightmares of </v>

3049
03:04:36.420 --> 03:04:40.980
<v Speaker 5>allied planners who were planning for d </v>
<v Speaker 5>day in the second world war.</v>

3050
03:04:40.981 --> 03:04:44.460
<v Speaker 5>You know the attack across the beaches,</v>
<v Speaker 5>across the english channel,</v>

3051
03:04:44.461 --> 03:04:47.460
<v Speaker 5>landing allied troops on the occupied </v>
<v Speaker 5>french coastline.</v>

3052
03:04:47.550 --> 03:04:52.550
<v Speaker 5>You can see what their nightmares must </v>
<v Speaker 5>have been like because they were young </v>

3053
03:04:52.550 --> 03:04:55.551
<v Speaker 5>men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When they got to see how something like </v>

3054
03:04:55.551 --> 03:04:57.681
<v Speaker 5>an amphibious assault could go wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they saw it on the beaches of </v>

3055
03:04:57.681 --> 03:04:59.160
<v Speaker 5>gullapalli.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

3056
03:04:59.790 --> 03:05:03.090
<v Speaker 5>it was a nightmare of improvisation.</v>

3057
03:05:04.630 --> 03:05:08.440
<v Speaker 5>These troops were trained for war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not trained for amphibious assault.</v>

3058
03:05:09.250 --> 03:05:11.350
<v Speaker 5>They landed sometimes on the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>beaches.</v>

3059
03:05:11.530 --> 03:05:14.980
<v Speaker 5>They had completely somehow gotten the </v>
<v Speaker 5>terrain or wrong.</v>

3060
03:05:14.981 --> 03:05:19.981
<v Speaker 5>Even with aerial surveillance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the poor australians are landed </v>

3061
03:05:19.981 --> 03:05:22.990
<v Speaker 5>in a cove a mile from where they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to land.</v>

3062
03:05:23.290 --> 03:05:28.290
<v Speaker 5>It's like a reverse amphitheater and </v>
<v Speaker 5>historian john keegan who visited the </v>

3063
03:05:28.290 --> 03:05:32.641
<v Speaker 5>site said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the one thing that overwhelms you when </v>

3064
03:05:32.641 --> 03:05:34.501
<v Speaker 5>you go there is how tiny it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's this tiny little cove and you drop </v>

3065
03:05:34.501 --> 03:05:38.671
<v Speaker 5>a ton of australians there with the high</v>
<v Speaker 5>ground all around them like an </v>

3066
03:05:38.671 --> 03:05:42.280
<v Speaker 5>amphitheater and just leave them there </v>
<v Speaker 5>on some of these beaches.</v>

3067
03:05:42.610 --> 03:05:46.510
<v Speaker 5>The allies are able to land route </v>
<v Speaker 5>relatively easily and try to capture the</v>

3068
03:05:46.511 --> 03:05:51.511
<v Speaker 5>high ground on other beaches they land </v>
<v Speaker 5>and aren't sure what to do on a couple </v>

3069
03:05:51.511 --> 03:05:55.861
<v Speaker 5>of these beaches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The turks are waiting for them and </v>

3070
03:05:55.861 --> 03:05:56.020
<v Speaker 5>massacres in shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In one,</v>

3071
03:05:56.470 --> 03:06:01.470
<v Speaker 5>the allies had taken a like a transport </v>
<v Speaker 5>ship and cut out a hole in it so that </v>

3072
03:06:01.661 --> 03:06:06.661
<v Speaker 5>they could drive it right up on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>beach and the soldiers could just jump </v>

3073
03:06:06.661 --> 03:06:10.111
<v Speaker 5>out and be ready to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The turks trained machine guns on the </v>

3074
03:06:10.111 --> 03:06:11.830
<v Speaker 5>door and when the door opened and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these troops jumped out,</v>

3075
03:06:11.831 --> 03:06:14.050
<v Speaker 5>they were machine guns one by one by </v>
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>

3076
03:06:14.051 --> 03:06:19.051
<v Speaker 5>As they hit the beach,</v>
<v Speaker 5>less than 25 of them made it to the </v>

3077
03:06:19.051 --> 03:06:19.720
<v Speaker 5>beach out of several hundred.</v>

3078
03:06:21.200 --> 03:06:25.220
<v Speaker 5>Even when the allied forces at great </v>
<v Speaker 5>cost sometimes take these beaches,</v>

3079
03:06:25.550 --> 03:06:30.550
<v Speaker 5>they're not always sure what to do next.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have no idea how things are going </v>

3080
03:06:30.550 --> 03:06:33.170
<v Speaker 5>on the beach next to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't know if the ship's know where</v>

3081
03:06:33.171 --> 03:06:35.060
<v Speaker 5>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ships don't know where they are.</v>

3082
03:06:35.270 --> 03:06:40.270
<v Speaker 5>There's no coordination going on and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>really get a wonderful object lesson in </v>

3083
03:06:40.641 --> 03:06:45.641
<v Speaker 5>which you're also getting on the western</v>
<v Speaker 5>front concerning what weapons system is </v>

3084
03:06:45.641 --> 03:06:47.720
<v Speaker 5>really missing from this war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it exists,</v>

3085
03:06:47.721 --> 03:06:52.721
<v Speaker 5>but not in a way where it's coordinated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not in a way that you'll see it come of </v>

3086
03:06:52.721 --> 03:06:55.991
<v Speaker 5>age in the next world war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of those things that when you </v>

3087
03:06:55.991 --> 03:06:56.250
<v Speaker 5>consider in a vacuum,</v>

3088
03:06:56.250 --> 03:06:58.770
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even sound like a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like barbed wire.</v>

3089
03:06:58.771 --> 03:07:00.240
<v Speaker 1>You don't think of barbed wire as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapon.</v>

3090
03:07:00.420 --> 03:07:03.810
<v Speaker 1>You don't think of radio communications </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a weapon either,</v>

3091
03:07:04.290 --> 03:07:08.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's been the missing ingredient in </v>
<v Speaker 1>so many of these missed opportunities in</v>

3092
03:07:08.761 --> 03:07:13.761
<v Speaker 1>this war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If only the troops that broke through </v>

3093
03:07:13.761 --> 03:07:16.401
<v Speaker 1>knew they broke through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if only they could change where the </v>

3094
03:07:16.401 --> 03:07:18.981
<v Speaker 1>artillery was shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If only we could bring up </v>

3095
03:07:18.981 --> 03:07:18.981
<v Speaker 1>reinforcements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This happens all the time on the western</v>

3096
03:07:18.981 --> 03:07:21.810
<v Speaker 1>front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's happening at [inaudible].</v>

3097
03:07:23.610 --> 03:07:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes these troops land and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sort of stand there.</v>

3098
03:07:26.611 --> 03:07:28.080
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what they're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do next.</v>

3099
03:07:28.110 --> 03:07:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Or they take the first position that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>plans ahead of time called for them to </v>

3100
03:07:33.110 --> 03:07:34.440
<v Speaker 1>take and they stopped there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you expect them to do?</v>

3101
03:07:34.500 --> 03:07:36.000
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what's going on.</v>

3102
03:07:36.520 --> 03:07:39.370
<v Speaker 1>They have to be careful or their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>artillery is going to shell them.</v>

3103
03:07:39.700 --> 03:07:44.700
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it allows the turks to respond and you </v>

3104
03:07:44.700 --> 03:07:49.411
<v Speaker 1>will see a lot of fighting going on for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the high ground of these areas that </v>

3105
03:07:49.411 --> 03:07:53.150
<v Speaker 1>overlook the beaches and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole plan still might have work is</v>

3106
03:07:53.151 --> 03:07:55.660
<v Speaker 1>the turks had turned out to be a soft </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy.</v>

3107
03:07:56.110 --> 03:08:01.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they'd turned out to be as weak and </v>

3108
03:08:01.110 --> 03:08:03.351
<v Speaker 1>as decadent and as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unmotivated as allied planner sort of </v>

3109
03:08:03.351 --> 03:08:04.420
<v Speaker 1>assumed that they would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

3110
03:08:04.421 --> 03:08:08.220
<v Speaker 1>they fought like lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the turks are capable of.</v>

3111
03:08:08.221 --> 03:08:10.950
<v Speaker 1>The turks are very dangerous soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ethnic turks especially,</v>

3112
03:08:11.370 --> 03:08:16.370
<v Speaker 1>and there'll be an incident at one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tops of these heights were allied </v>

3113
03:08:16.370 --> 03:08:20.121
<v Speaker 1>forces are fighting with turkish forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>led by a guy named mustafa kemal,</v>

3114
03:08:20.950 --> 03:08:25.950
<v Speaker 1>who after the war will become one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most important figures in postwar </v>

3115
03:08:25.950 --> 03:08:29.221
<v Speaker 1>Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about 35 years old and he sees the </v>

3116
03:08:29.221 --> 03:08:30.820
<v Speaker 1>allied forces in his area reaching the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heights.</v>

3117
03:08:30.821 --> 03:08:35.821
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows that these heights are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be important and he orders his </v>

3118
03:08:35.821 --> 03:08:38.911
<v Speaker 1>troops that are out of ammunition to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold them off and he says these famous </v>

3119
03:08:38.940 --> 03:08:40.990
<v Speaker 1>lines that have gone down in turkish </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

3120
03:08:41.560 --> 03:08:42.160
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

3121
03:08:43.150 --> 03:08:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't order you to attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I order you to die in the time which </v>

3122
03:08:48.150 --> 03:08:50.170
<v Speaker 1>passes until we die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other troops and commanders can take our</v>

3123
03:08:50.171 --> 03:08:52.370
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>End quote.</v>

3124
03:08:53.720 --> 03:08:56.870
<v Speaker 1>That's about the opposite reaction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the allies were expecting.</v>

3125
03:08:56.871 --> 03:09:01.871
<v Speaker 1>The turk resistance to be like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The allied resistance is just as </v>

3126
03:09:02.401 --> 03:09:07.401
<v Speaker 1>spirited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The australians and new zealanders and </v>

3127
03:09:07.401 --> 03:09:07.401
<v Speaker 1>gurkhas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To Be honest,</v>

3128
03:09:07.401 --> 03:09:12.391
<v Speaker 1>we'll prove themselves some of the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not the best fighters in the war on </v>

3129
03:09:12.391 --> 03:09:16.501
<v Speaker 1>these beaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're completely hamstrung by the </v>

3130
03:09:16.501 --> 03:09:19.570
<v Speaker 1>screw up of the situation and in almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>no time,</v>

3131
03:09:20.290 --> 03:09:25.290
<v Speaker 1>the gallipoli campaign turns into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mediterranean version of the western </v>

3132
03:09:26.921 --> 03:09:31.921
<v Speaker 1>front and it's got all the same tragic </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallmarks that the western front has </v>

3133
03:09:34.730 --> 03:09:38.720
<v Speaker 1>barbed wire artillery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no man's land trenches.</v>

3134
03:09:38.721 --> 03:09:42.580
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing and the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>historian would point out that of course</v>

3135
03:09:42.581 --> 03:09:44.680
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same situation,</v>

3136
03:09:44.681 --> 03:09:48.640
<v Speaker 1>the same things and conditions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>created the need to have people dig into</v>

3137
03:09:48.641 --> 03:09:53.020
<v Speaker 1>the earth and they created the power of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the defensive over the offensive is just</v>

3138
03:09:53.110 --> 03:09:54.400
<v Speaker 1>present in the mediterranean</v>

3139
03:09:54.400 --> 03:09:56.320
<v Speaker 5>and the aegean as it is on the western </v>
<v Speaker 5>front.</v>

3140
03:09:57.340 --> 03:10:02.340
<v Speaker 5>The australians find out about this </v>
<v Speaker 5>firsthand and I grew up next to an air </v>

3141
03:10:02.340 --> 03:10:06.421
<v Speaker 5>force colonel when I was a kid who </v>
<v Speaker 5>fought in the second world war and I </v>

3142
03:10:06.421 --> 03:10:07.000
<v Speaker 5>used to ask him who the toughest </v>
<v Speaker 5>soldiers were.</v>

3143
03:10:07.020 --> 03:10:08.290
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wHen I'm eight.</v>

3144
03:10:08.320 --> 03:10:13.320
<v Speaker 5>That was an interesting question to me </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I always wanted to hear something </v>

3145
03:10:13.320 --> 03:10:16.891
<v Speaker 5>like the germans and I remember he </v>
<v Speaker 5>surprised me once by saying the british </v>

3146
03:10:16.891 --> 03:10:19.240
<v Speaker 5>in general and the australians and New </v>
<v Speaker 5>Zealand troops specifically,</v>

3147
03:10:19.540 --> 03:10:20.740
<v Speaker 5>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>

3148
03:10:20.741 --> 03:10:25.741
<v Speaker 5>And he said because you would find </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself in these horrible situations </v>

3149
03:10:25.741 --> 03:10:29.140
<v Speaker 5>and they would be laughing and joking </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he said,</v>

3150
03:10:29.141 --> 03:10:34.141
<v Speaker 5>that's indicative of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a level of bravery that you don't </v>

3151
03:10:34.141 --> 03:10:35.680
<v Speaker 5>normally see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't always help you.</v>

3152
03:10:35.681 --> 03:10:37.130
<v Speaker 5>There's a story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3153
03:10:37.380 --> 03:10:42.380
<v Speaker 5>of an australian corporate who wrote </v>
<v Speaker 5>about being pinned down on one of these </v>

3154
03:10:42.380 --> 03:10:45.481
<v Speaker 5>beaches when they land and the turks </v>
<v Speaker 5>have the high ground and they're </v>

3155
03:10:45.481 --> 03:10:47.971
<v Speaker 5>shooting down at these poor australians </v>
<v Speaker 5>who are trying to get their act </v>

3156
03:10:47.971 --> 03:10:47.971
<v Speaker 5>together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get organized,</v>

3157
03:10:47.971 --> 03:10:52.531
<v Speaker 5>figure out what we do next while they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>under fire and while their friends are </v>

3158
03:10:52.531 --> 03:10:52.531
<v Speaker 5>dying.</v>

3159
03:10:52.531 --> 03:10:54.070
<v Speaker 5>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for a little while,</v>

3160
03:10:54.130 --> 03:10:55.690
<v Speaker 5>some of them are laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He writes,</v>

3161
03:10:55.691 --> 03:11:00.691
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a galling fire rained on us from the </v>

3162
03:11:00.691 --> 03:11:03.781
<v Speaker 5>left where there were high cliffs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One man dropped down alongside me </v>

3163
03:11:03.781 --> 03:11:05.620
<v Speaker 5>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I broke the news to him gently.</v>

3164
03:11:05.770 --> 03:11:08.410
<v Speaker 5>You've got yourself into the hottest </v>
<v Speaker 5>corner you'll ever strike.</v>

3165
03:11:08.650 --> 03:11:12.490
<v Speaker 5>I'd shown him where the enemy were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He fired a few shots and again,</v>

3166
03:11:12.491 --> 03:11:14.320
<v Speaker 5>I heard the sickening thought of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bullet.</v>

3167
03:11:14.620 --> 03:11:18.130
<v Speaker 5>I looked at him in horror.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The bullet had fearfully mashed his face</v>

3168
03:11:18.131 --> 03:11:20.380
<v Speaker 5>and gone down his throat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rendering him dumb,</v>

3169
03:11:20.680 --> 03:11:22.630
<v Speaker 5>but his eyes were dreadful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To behold,</v>

3170
03:11:22.900 --> 03:11:26.020
<v Speaker 5>how he squirmed in agony.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was nothing I could do for him,</v>

3171
03:11:26.021 --> 03:11:31.021
<v Speaker 5>but pray that he might die swiftly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It took them about 20 minutes to </v>

3172
03:11:31.021 --> 03:11:34.501
<v Speaker 5>accomplish this and by that time he </v>
<v Speaker 5>tangled up his legs and pain and </v>

3173
03:11:34.501 --> 03:11:38.281
<v Speaker 5>stiffened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw the waxy color creep over his </v>

3174
03:11:38.281 --> 03:11:39.390
<v Speaker 5>cheek and breathe easier and cool.</v>

3175
03:11:40.450 --> 03:11:44.050
<v Speaker 5>Amazing to think about this one person </v>
<v Speaker 5>who's got to consider his own life,</v>

3176
03:11:44.051 --> 03:11:46.780
<v Speaker 5>which is under attack,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how he deals with troops,</v>

3177
03:11:46.781 --> 03:11:51.781
<v Speaker 5>who need him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he gets to watch that going on for </v>

3178
03:11:51.781 --> 03:11:53.690
<v Speaker 5>20 minutes to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I tend to focus on the horror and the</v>

3179
03:11:53.691 --> 03:11:54.640
<v Speaker 5>story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

3180
03:11:54.670 --> 03:11:58.930
<v Speaker 5>it's because that's what gets to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Any history read on any subject is going</v>

3181
03:11:58.931 --> 03:12:02.710
<v Speaker 5>to by its very nature the person telling</v>
<v Speaker 5>the story,</v>

3182
03:12:02.711 --> 03:12:05.050
<v Speaker 5>usually a historian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then sometimes you get stuck with me</v>

3183
03:12:05.620 --> 03:12:09.340
<v Speaker 5>is going to focus on the things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>intrigue or interest them for me.</v>

3184
03:12:09.760 --> 03:12:14.760
<v Speaker 5>It's what these people had to go through</v>
<v Speaker 5>on all sides and it's the horror that I </v>

3185
03:12:14.760 --> 03:12:18.850
<v Speaker 5>constantly try to imagine myself </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiencing and it's mind blowing to me</v>

3186
03:12:19.300 --> 03:12:21.280
<v Speaker 5>and I think after as many shows as we've</v>
<v Speaker 5>done,</v>

3187
03:12:21.281 --> 03:12:23.680
<v Speaker 5>the ones who've stayed with me listening</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you,</v>

3188
03:12:24.190 --> 03:12:26.010
<v Speaker 5>there's got to be something that touches</v>
<v Speaker 5>you too.</v>

3189
03:12:26.450 --> 03:12:31.450
<v Speaker 5>AT the literally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have this same charnel house </v>

3190
03:12:31.450 --> 03:12:34.890
<v Speaker 5>situation where dead bodies are a part </v>
<v Speaker 5>of your life and living amongst them is </v>

3191
03:12:37.271 --> 03:12:39.820
<v Speaker 5>part of the horror.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's bad enough that your life is always</v>

3192
03:12:39.821 --> 03:12:44.821
<v Speaker 5>at stake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you watch all this death and </v>

3193
03:12:44.821 --> 03:12:44.821
<v Speaker 5>destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you live with corpses.</v>

3194
03:12:44.821 --> 03:12:47.860
<v Speaker 5>Corpses of people you often know or </v>
<v Speaker 5>knew.</v>

3195
03:12:48.670 --> 03:12:53.670
<v Speaker 5>This is a remembrance by british soldier</v>
<v Speaker 5>leonard thompson who arrives at the </v>

3196
03:12:53.670 --> 03:12:56.360
<v Speaker 5>dardanelles right after the major </v>
<v Speaker 5>landing quote.</v>

3197
03:12:57.120 --> 03:13:02.120
<v Speaker 5>We arrived at the dardanelles and saw </v>
<v Speaker 5>the guns flashing and heard the rifle </v>

3198
03:13:02.120 --> 03:13:03.060
<v Speaker 5>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They heaved our ship,</v>

3199
03:13:03.090 --> 03:13:05.040
<v Speaker 5>the river clyde,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right up to the shore.</v>

3200
03:13:05.250 --> 03:13:07.470
<v Speaker 5>They had cut a hole in it and made a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little pier,</v>

3201
03:13:07.471 --> 03:13:10.110
<v Speaker 5>so we were able to walk straight off and</v>
<v Speaker 5>onto the beach.</v>

3202
03:13:10.350 --> 03:13:14.130
<v Speaker 5>We all sat there on the hellespont </v>
<v Speaker 5>waiting for it to get light.</v>

3203
03:13:14.430 --> 03:13:17.670
<v Speaker 5>The first things we saw were big wreck </v>
<v Speaker 5>turkish guns.</v>

3204
03:13:17.910 --> 03:13:21.600
<v Speaker 5>The second a big marquee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It didn't make me think of the military,</v>

3205
03:13:21.780 --> 03:13:24.840
<v Speaker 5>but if the village phets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>other people must have thought like this</v>

3206
03:13:24.841 --> 03:13:29.841
<v Speaker 5>too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I remember hoW we all rushed up </v>

3207
03:13:29.841 --> 03:13:30.870
<v Speaker 5>to it like boys getting into a circus </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then found it all laced up.</v>

3208
03:13:31.140 --> 03:13:34.440
<v Speaker 5>We unlaced it and rushed in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was full of corpses,</v>

3209
03:13:34.710 --> 03:13:39.710
<v Speaker 5>dead englishman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lines and lines of them with their eyes </v>

3210
03:13:39.710 --> 03:13:40.260
<v Speaker 5>wide open.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We all stopped talking.</v>

3211
03:13:40.620 --> 03:13:45.620
<v Speaker 5>I'd never seen a dead man before and </v>
<v Speaker 5>here I was looking at two or 300 of </v>

3212
03:13:45.620 --> 03:13:46.410
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was our first fear.</v>

3213
03:13:46.620 --> 03:13:51.620
<v Speaker 5>Nobody had mentioned this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was very shocked and I thought of </v>

3214
03:13:51.620 --> 03:13:54.831
<v Speaker 5>suffolk and how it seemed to happy place</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the first time we set to work to </v>

3215
03:13:54.831 --> 03:13:59.691
<v Speaker 5>bury people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We push them into the sides of the </v>

3216
03:13:59.691 --> 03:14:02.301
<v Speaker 5>trench,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but bits of them kept getting uncovered </v>

3217
03:14:02.301 --> 03:14:02.940
<v Speaker 5>and sticking out like people in a badly </v>
<v Speaker 5>made bed.</v>

3218
03:14:03.150 --> 03:14:06.120
<v Speaker 5>Hands were the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They would escape from the sand,</v>

3219
03:14:06.270 --> 03:14:07.350
<v Speaker 5>pointing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>begging,</v>

3220
03:14:07.380 --> 03:14:10.590
<v Speaker 5>even waving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was one which we all shook when we</v>

3221
03:14:10.591 --> 03:14:13.860
<v Speaker 5>passed by saying good morning in a posh </v>
<v Speaker 5>voice,</v>

3222
03:14:14.040 --> 03:14:19.040
<v Speaker 5>everybody did it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The bottom of the trench was springy </v>

3223
03:14:19.040 --> 03:14:21.951
<v Speaker 5>like a mattress because of all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bodies underneath at night when the </v>

3224
03:14:21.951 --> 03:14:25.581
<v Speaker 5>stench was worse,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we tied crepe around our mouth and </v>

3225
03:14:25.581 --> 03:14:28.731
<v Speaker 5>noses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This crepe had been given to us because </v>

3226
03:14:28.731 --> 03:14:28.731
<v Speaker 5>it was supposed to prevent us from being</v>
<v Speaker 5>gassed.</v>

3227
03:14:28.731 --> 03:14:33.210
<v Speaker 5>The flies entered the trenches at night </v>
<v Speaker 5>and lined them completely with a density</v>

3228
03:14:33.211 --> 03:14:38.211
<v Speaker 5>which was like moving cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We killed millions of them by slapping </v>

3229
03:14:38.211 --> 03:14:42.381
<v Speaker 5>our spades along the trench wall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the next night it would be just as </v>

3230
03:14:42.381 --> 03:14:45.951
<v Speaker 5>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were All lousy and we couldn't stop </v>

3231
03:14:45.951 --> 03:14:48.600
<v Speaker 5>shitting because we caught dysentery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We wept not because we were frightened.</v>

3232
03:14:49.240 --> 03:14:54.240
<v Speaker 5>We were so dirty and quote and like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bad movie.</v>

3233
03:14:55.780 --> 03:15:00.780
<v Speaker 5>The gallipoli campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was supposed to do an end around </v>

3234
03:15:00.780 --> 03:15:04.750
<v Speaker 5>the suffering of the western front and </v>
<v Speaker 5>ended more quickly by striking,</v>

3235
03:15:04.810 --> 03:15:09.810
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the weak joint in the enemy's alliance </v>

3236
03:15:09.810 --> 03:15:10.930
<v Speaker 5>just extended that suffering to a new </v>
<v Speaker 5>front.</v>

3237
03:15:12.490 --> 03:15:17.230
<v Speaker 5>The entire affair will get continually </v>
<v Speaker 5>worse as generals and admirals,</v>

3238
03:15:17.231 --> 03:15:22.231
<v Speaker 5>who don't want to admit defeat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep pouring more and more </v>

3239
03:15:22.231 --> 03:15:22.480
<v Speaker 5>reinforcements into it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The turks do the same thing.</v>

3240
03:15:22.481 --> 03:15:27.481
<v Speaker 5>It just becomes this ongoing hell and </v>
<v Speaker 5>this ongoing hell will eventually cost </v>

3241
03:15:28.571 --> 03:15:31.450
<v Speaker 5>winston churchill his job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

3242
03:15:31.451 --> 03:15:34.060
<v Speaker 5>the british government essentially has </v>
<v Speaker 5>to reorganize.</v>

3243
03:15:34.061 --> 03:15:39.061
<v Speaker 5>They have to create a coalition </v>
<v Speaker 5>government and churchill's the one left </v>

3244
03:15:39.061 --> 03:15:41.611
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He will leave the admiralty were told </v>

3245
03:15:41.611 --> 03:15:43.180
<v Speaker 5>after being sacked with tears in his </v>
<v Speaker 5>eyes,</v>

3246
03:15:43.210 --> 03:15:48.210
<v Speaker 5>certain that his career is over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Talk about one of the great mistakes all</v>

3247
03:15:49.291 --> 03:15:51.300
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously he has a great career ahead of</v>

3248
03:15:51.301 --> 03:15:52.420
<v Speaker 5>him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but churchill,</v>

3249
03:15:52.500 --> 03:15:57.000
<v Speaker 5>a weird guy and then we'd have to watch </v>
<v Speaker 5>myself with him because I liked him.</v>

3250
03:15:57.270 --> 03:16:00.000
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of us like him as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>historical figure.</v>

3251
03:16:00.001 --> 03:16:02.940
<v Speaker 5>He's quite likable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>teddy roosevelt's the same way,</v>

3252
03:16:03.330 --> 03:16:08.330
<v Speaker 5>but you have to remember that these guys</v>
<v Speaker 5>have qualities that make them somewhat </v>

3253
03:16:08.330 --> 03:16:11.220
<v Speaker 5>unusual and it's hard to factor those </v>
<v Speaker 5>qualities into the man.</v>

3254
03:16:11.990 --> 03:16:15.230
<v Speaker 5>Churchill told one of his best friends </v>
<v Speaker 5>in february 19,</v>

3255
03:16:15.231 --> 03:16:20.231
<v Speaker 5>15,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the time when he's planning this whole </v>

3256
03:16:20.231 --> 03:16:22.930
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something that's relatively shocking to </v>

3257
03:16:22.930 --> 03:16:26.291
<v Speaker 5>hear when the whole world is stunned by </v>
<v Speaker 5>the carnage of the worst war in human </v>

3258
03:16:26.421 --> 03:16:29.780
<v Speaker 5>history.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He told his friend this quote,</v>

3259
03:16:30.230 --> 03:16:34.310
<v Speaker 5>I think a curse should rest on me </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I love this war.</v>

3260
03:16:34.460 --> 03:16:37.940
<v Speaker 5>I know it's smashing and shattering the </v>
<v Speaker 5>lives of thousands every moment,</v>

3261
03:16:37.941 --> 03:16:42.920
<v Speaker 5>and yet I can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I enjoy every second of it and to quote,</v>

3262
03:16:44.150 --> 03:16:49.150
<v Speaker 5>imaGine if the people whose loved ones </v>
<v Speaker 5>were over there fighting and dying and </v>

3263
03:16:49.150 --> 03:16:52.180
<v Speaker 5>her churchill admitted that and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

3264
03:16:52.200 --> 03:16:57.200
<v Speaker 5>one of the things that happens when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>use churchill's account of these events </v>

3265
03:16:57.200 --> 03:17:01.011
<v Speaker 5>that he played an important role in is </v>
<v Speaker 5>you get all his excuses and you get his </v>

3266
03:17:01.011 --> 03:17:02.730
<v Speaker 5>point of view and you get,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3267
03:17:02.740 --> 03:17:07.740
<v Speaker 5>very one sided account of these affairs </v>
<v Speaker 5>where churchill is the hero and he was </v>

3268
03:17:07.740 --> 03:17:11.331
<v Speaker 5>right all along and if only people had </v>
<v Speaker 5>listened to him and if only they hadn't </v>

3269
03:17:11.331 --> 03:17:11.331
<v Speaker 5>screwed up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his plans at all would have been great.</v>

3270
03:17:12.440 --> 03:17:16.060
<v Speaker 5>But there are very good historians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Peter Hart and britain I find to be very</v>

3271
03:17:16.061 --> 03:17:21.061
<v Speaker 5>fair and he had this to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's not on the churchill was right </v>

3272
03:17:21.061 --> 03:17:25.560
<v Speaker 5>bandwagon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wrote about the whole gullapalli </v>

3273
03:17:25.560 --> 03:17:28.231
<v Speaker 5>affair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Quote apologists for the gallipoli </v>

3274
03:17:28.231 --> 03:17:31.841
<v Speaker 5>campaign have long tried to boast of </v>
<v Speaker 5>what could have been with a heavy </v>

3275
03:17:31.841 --> 03:17:36.341
<v Speaker 5>emphasis on if only this fails to </v>
<v Speaker 5>recognize that the allies bought the </v>

3276
03:17:36.341 --> 03:17:41.321
<v Speaker 5>campaign with levels of naval and </v>
<v Speaker 5>military support that were considered </v>

3277
03:17:41.321 --> 03:17:42.260
<v Speaker 5>acceptable until the turks defeated </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

3278
03:17:42.500 --> 03:17:47.500
<v Speaker 5>Time and time again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hamilton promised success again and </v>

3279
03:17:47.500 --> 03:17:47.500
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he failed.</v>

3280
03:17:47.510 --> 03:17:52.510
<v Speaker 5>Go liberally was one of a series of </v>
<v Speaker 5>military easterner adventures launched </v>

3281
03:17:52.510 --> 03:17:57.311
<v Speaker 5>without proper analysis of the global </v>
<v Speaker 5>strategic situation without </v>

3282
03:17:57.311 --> 03:17:58.430
<v Speaker 5>consideration of the local tactical </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation,</v>

3283
03:17:58.580 --> 03:18:03.580
<v Speaker 5>ignoring logistical realities,</v>
<v Speaker 5>underestimating the strength of the </v>

3284
03:18:03.580 --> 03:18:07.271
<v Speaker 5>opposition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and predicted on a hugely optimistic </v>

3285
03:18:07.271 --> 03:18:08.120
<v Speaker 5>assessment of the military capabilities </v>
<v Speaker 5>of their own troops.</v>

3286
03:18:08.360 --> 03:18:11.930
<v Speaker 5>Not for nothing is hubris regarded as </v>
<v Speaker 5>the english disease,</v>

3287
03:18:12.230 --> 03:18:14.780
<v Speaker 5>but the gallipoli campaign was a serious</v>
<v Speaker 5>matter.</v>

3288
03:18:14.990 --> 03:18:18.170
<v Speaker 5>vital resources have been drawn away </v>
<v Speaker 5>from where it really mattered.</v>

3289
03:18:18.350 --> 03:18:20.990
<v Speaker 5>The turks were all but helpless if left </v>
<v Speaker 5>on their own.</v>

3290
03:18:21.320 --> 03:18:26.320
<v Speaker 5>They had tried to launch an ambitious </v>
<v Speaker 5>attack across the sinai desert on the </v>

3291
03:18:26.320 --> 03:18:26.930
<v Speaker 5>suez canal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but had been easily thwarted.</v>

3292
03:18:27.230 --> 03:18:32.230
<v Speaker 5>Gullapalli achieved nothing but to </v>
<v Speaker 5>provide the turks with the opportunity </v>

3293
03:18:32.230 --> 03:18:36.341
<v Speaker 5>to slaughter british and french troops </v>
<v Speaker 5>and copious numbers in a situation in </v>

3294
03:18:36.341 --> 03:18:37.490
<v Speaker 5>which everything was in the defenders </v>
<v Speaker 5>favor.</v>

3295
03:18:37.760 --> 03:18:42.760
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>back on the western front was the real </v>

3296
03:18:42.760 --> 03:18:43.650
<v Speaker 5>enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the german pyre and quote,</v>

3297
03:18:44.840 --> 03:18:48.310
<v Speaker 5>and by saying that [inaudible] was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>side show</v>

3298
03:18:48.730 --> 03:18:52.000
<v Speaker 1>and blaming churchill in large part for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the disaster.</v>

3299
03:18:54.600 --> 03:18:57.270
<v Speaker 1>While this tragic side show was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

3300
03:18:57.960 --> 03:19:02.960
<v Speaker 1>another horrible disaster was as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a conflict after all full of </v>

3301
03:19:02.960 --> 03:19:06.060
<v Speaker 1>horrible disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this one was somewhat different from</v>

3302
03:19:06.061 --> 03:19:08.520
<v Speaker 1>soldiers fighting it out on </v>
<v Speaker 1>battlefields.</v>

3303
03:19:08.910 --> 03:19:13.910
<v Speaker 1>This one involved an entire people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several entire peoples in fact,</v>

3304
03:19:16.560 --> 03:19:21.560
<v Speaker 1>and it is perhaps the most argued about </v>
<v Speaker 1>case of genocide in world history.</v>

3305
03:19:26.440 --> 03:19:28.990
<v Speaker 1>In order to understand the context of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're about to talk about,</v>

3306
03:19:29.410 --> 03:19:34.410
<v Speaker 1>we need to recall how much of a role the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of ethnic self-determination plays </v>

3307
03:19:35.770 --> 03:19:40.770
<v Speaker 1>in leading up to the conditions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>create the first world war and to the </v>

3308
03:19:40.770 --> 03:19:42.430
<v Speaker 1>first world war itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

3309
03:19:42.431 --> 03:19:47.431
<v Speaker 1>there are a bunch of centuries old pre </v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century empires that sort of </v>

3310
03:19:48.281 --> 03:19:53.281
<v Speaker 1>stumbled into the 20th century carrying </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of baggage from previous era's</v>

3311
03:19:53.981 --> 03:19:58.981
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baggage that is in part tearing them </v>

3312
03:19:58.981 --> 03:20:00.160
<v Speaker 1>apart and a lot of this baggage is </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic.</v>

3313
03:20:00.820 --> 03:20:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The austrian hungarian empire is a </v>

3314
03:20:05.820 --> 03:20:08.221
<v Speaker 1>perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a multiethnic empire with a ton </v>

3315
03:20:08.221 --> 03:20:11.941
<v Speaker 1>of different ethnicities in it that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>presided over by a german slash </v>

3316
03:20:11.941 --> 03:20:16.201
<v Speaker 1>hungarian elite on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these people are equal </v>

3317
03:20:16.201 --> 03:20:20.700
<v Speaker 1>austro-hungarian subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you happen to not be german or </v>

3318
03:20:20.700 --> 03:20:24.331
<v Speaker 1>hungarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often you don't feel very equal and </v>

3319
03:20:24.331 --> 03:20:27.091
<v Speaker 1>during this time period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many different ethnic groups are either </v>

3320
03:20:27.091 --> 03:20:30.541
<v Speaker 1>looking to create their own states for </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves or they're looking to join </v>

3321
03:20:31.420 --> 03:20:34.150
<v Speaker 1>with ethnic brethren of theirs that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>already done this.</v>

3322
03:20:35.380 --> 03:20:40.380
<v Speaker 1>When the first world war is touched off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's recall it's touched off by a serb </v>

3323
03:20:40.380 --> 03:20:42.190
<v Speaker 1>nationalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone the slavs would probably look at</v>

3324
03:20:42.191 --> 03:20:47.191
<v Speaker 1>as a patriot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the austro-hungarian is looked at </v>

3325
03:20:47.191 --> 03:20:50.401
<v Speaker 1>him as a terrorist and looked at any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own people that wanted to join </v>

3326
03:20:50.401 --> 03:20:54.900
<v Speaker 1>with Serbia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A not that old country created by the </v>

3327
03:20:54.900 --> 03:20:56.080
<v Speaker 1>ethnic serves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who wanted to do that,</v>

3328
03:20:56.081 --> 03:21:01.081
<v Speaker 1>who was an austro-hungarian subject was </v>
<v Speaker 1>now treasonous and an insurrectionist </v>

3329
03:21:01.081 --> 03:21:05.251
<v Speaker 1>and a rebel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you'rE actually in a war with </v>

3330
03:21:05.251 --> 03:21:07.531
<v Speaker 1>that country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a fifth columnist or a cancer on </v>

3331
03:21:07.531 --> 03:21:07.660
<v Speaker 1>your nation</v>

3332
03:21:09.190 --> 03:21:14.190
<v Speaker 1>and there's no question that there are a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of empires that are dealing with </v>

3333
03:21:14.201 --> 03:21:19.201
<v Speaker 1>these problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there are a bunch that just </v>

3334
03:21:19.201 --> 03:21:19.201
<v Speaker 1>sorta put those problems off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the winners in the first world war,</v>

3335
03:21:19.201 --> 03:21:23.971
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>britain and France are only going to </v>

3336
03:21:23.971 --> 03:21:24.730
<v Speaker 1>push these questions farther down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road and after the next world war,</v>

3337
03:21:24.910 --> 03:21:29.910
<v Speaker 1>the british will be dealing with similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>situations in India and the french will </v>

3338
03:21:29.910 --> 03:21:30.820
<v Speaker 1>be dealing with it in north africa and </v>
<v Speaker 1>indochina,</v>

3339
03:21:31.300 --> 03:21:36.300
<v Speaker 1>but the ostrow hungarians and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>russians and the ottoman empire deal </v>

3340
03:21:36.300 --> 03:21:39.751
<v Speaker 1>with it now and it creates huge problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it does so in a realm that is </v>

3341
03:21:39.941 --> 03:21:44.941
<v Speaker 1>historically extremely violent inducing </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic in these old empires where people</v>

3342
03:21:47.931 --> 03:21:51.500
<v Speaker 1>have very long memories and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>

3343
03:21:52.140 --> 03:21:57.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>atrocities that the other side is </v>

3344
03:21:57.140 --> 03:21:58.340
<v Speaker 1>committed over the centuries that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can point to as a justification for what</v>

3345
03:21:58.341 --> 03:21:59.600
<v Speaker 1>they are going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3346
03:22:01.240 --> 03:22:03.160
<v Speaker 1>modern people can think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

3347
03:22:03.430 --> 03:22:08.430
<v Speaker 1>of the situation in the middle east </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now and how to sit down with </v>

3348
03:22:08.430 --> 03:22:08.910
<v Speaker 1>anyone who's involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3349
03:22:08.950 --> 03:22:12.970
<v Speaker 1>close at hand with those conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you find out is everyone</v>

3350
03:22:12.971 --> 03:22:16.510
<v Speaker 1>has a ton of bad things that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>point to that the other side did,</v>

3351
03:22:16.690 --> 03:22:21.690
<v Speaker 1>and after a while your head just spins </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't even know where to </v>

3352
03:22:21.690 --> 03:22:24.301
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's got such long memories and </v>

3353
03:22:24.301 --> 03:22:24.490
<v Speaker 1>there are so many bad things that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened that they pointed.</v>

3354
03:22:24.491 --> 03:22:27.640
<v Speaker 1>The other side is being responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3355
03:22:27.641 --> 03:22:32.641
<v Speaker 1>you just don't even know how to solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>that problem and untie that gordian </v>

3356
03:22:32.641 --> 03:22:36.481
<v Speaker 1>knot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's nothing compared to the </v>

3357
03:22:36.481 --> 03:22:38.941
<v Speaker 1>ethnic memories of people in europe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone who remembers the breakup of the </v>

3358
03:22:38.951 --> 03:22:42.970
<v Speaker 1>former yugoslavia and the middle 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties in a will remember.</v>

3359
03:22:43.630 --> 03:22:46.930
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfect example of how deep </v>
<v Speaker 1>these ethnic tensions go.</v>

3360
03:22:47.290 --> 03:22:52.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were all under the impression that </v>

3361
03:22:52.290 --> 03:22:54.660
<v Speaker 1>that whole ethnic animosity between </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups in those areas had been tamed and</v>

3362
03:22:55.451 --> 03:22:58.000
<v Speaker 1>that those fires had been completely put</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

3363
03:22:58.810 --> 03:23:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Little did we know that the heat under </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ashes were smoldering the whole time</v>

3364
03:23:02.950 --> 03:23:07.950
<v Speaker 1>that all it took was a little gasoline </v>
<v Speaker 1>poured on the smoldering heat for it to </v>

3365
03:23:07.950 --> 03:23:10.270
<v Speaker 1>flare up and for horrible things to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

3366
03:23:10.420 --> 03:23:12.160
<v Speaker 1>And then when you went and questioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone,</v>

3367
03:23:12.280 --> 03:23:17.280
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a serb or croat or a bosnian muslim </v>

3368
03:23:17.280 --> 03:23:20.731
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would point to the other side and </v>

3369
03:23:20.731 --> 03:23:21.820
<v Speaker 1>talk about hundreds of years of awful </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they had done to them.</v>

3370
03:23:22.360 --> 03:23:25.150
<v Speaker 1>You don'T even know where to begin with </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic hatred like that.</v>

3371
03:23:26.200 --> 03:23:30.070
<v Speaker 1>The worst situation of this kind that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens in the first world war,</v>

3372
03:23:30.071 --> 03:23:32.980
<v Speaker 1>although it happens in a lot of places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's not forget,</v>

3373
03:23:32.981 --> 03:23:37.981
<v Speaker 1>during the 1915 retreat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the russians did a lot of terrible </v>

3374
03:23:37.981 --> 03:23:37.981
<v Speaker 1>things to poles and jews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3375
03:23:37.981 --> 03:23:42.631
<v Speaker 1>these things get paled though in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>history books by comparison with what </v>

3376
03:23:42.631 --> 03:23:44.260
<v Speaker 1>happened to the christian minorities in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ottoman empire.</v>

3377
03:23:46.270 --> 03:23:51.270
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greeks who have been inhabiting the </v>

3378
03:23:51.270 --> 03:23:54.580
<v Speaker 1>anatolian plain of asia minor since the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bronze age,</v>

3379
03:23:55.210 --> 03:23:57.250
<v Speaker 1>or the assyrian people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the christian,</v>

3380
03:23:57.251 --> 03:24:02.251
<v Speaker 1>the syrian minority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in what's now kind of northern Iraq </v>

3381
03:24:02.251 --> 03:24:05.920
<v Speaker 1>and who claim to be the descendants of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ancient assyrians.</v>

3382
03:24:05.921 --> 03:24:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Which if that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird,</v>

3383
03:24:08.021 --> 03:24:11.380
<v Speaker 1>horrible karmic wheel of genocide coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

3384
03:24:11.400 --> 03:24:13.240
<v Speaker 1>hit them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because after all,</v>

3385
03:24:13.241 --> 03:24:17.380
<v Speaker 1>the biblical assyrians are one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very early confirmable,</v>

3386
03:24:17.750 --> 03:24:22.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instigators of ethnic cleansing and </v>

3387
03:24:22.750 --> 03:24:22.750
<v Speaker 1>genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can find ben,</v>

3388
03:24:22.750 --> 03:24:26.800
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most famous of all the armenians.</v>

3389
03:24:27.730 --> 03:24:32.730
<v Speaker 1>The armenians are an ancient people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabit an area that during the first </v>

3390
03:24:34.001 --> 03:24:38.530
<v Speaker 1>world war is kind of around where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>borders of Russia and the ottoman empire</v>

3391
03:24:38.531 --> 03:24:43.531
<v Speaker 1>come together to historic arch enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The armenians caught in the middle</v>

3392
03:24:44.430 --> 03:24:47.610
<v Speaker 5>and they always have been certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>periods in history.</v>

3393
03:24:47.611 --> 03:24:49.800
<v Speaker 5>They've been able to form their own </v>
<v Speaker 5>independent state.</v>

3394
03:24:50.220 --> 03:24:51.410
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when rome,</v>

3395
03:24:51.460 --> 03:24:52.620
<v Speaker 5>persia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're a little weak.</v>

3396
03:24:52.621 --> 03:24:54.810
<v Speaker 5>They could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then as soon as roman persian,</v>

3397
03:24:55.200 --> 03:24:57.020
<v Speaker 5>the ancient world got their act together</v>
<v Speaker 5>from.</v>

3398
03:24:57.060 --> 03:25:00.390
<v Speaker 5>They swallowed up Armenia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Armenia was the first official christian</v>

3399
03:25:00.391 --> 03:25:05.391
<v Speaker 5>state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which did not particularly make the </v>

3400
03:25:05.391 --> 03:25:05.391
<v Speaker 5>ottomans enthusiastic.</v>

3401
03:25:05.670 --> 03:25:10.670
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of part of the reasons that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the armenians in the ottoman empire had </v>

3402
03:25:10.670 --> 03:25:14.931
<v Speaker 5>always been treated as second class </v>
<v Speaker 5>citizens and they remind one of the jews</v>

3403
03:25:16.080 --> 03:25:21.080
<v Speaker 5>in Russia where periodically you would </v>
<v Speaker 5>have these pogroms or these,</v>

3404
03:25:21.300 --> 03:25:25.860
<v Speaker 5>these incidents of violence breakout </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are just appalling when men,</v>

3405
03:25:25.861 --> 03:25:27.480
<v Speaker 5>women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and children would just be slaughtered.</v>

3406
03:25:27.481 --> 03:25:28.680
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were in 18,</v>

3407
03:25:28.681 --> 03:25:29.300
<v Speaker 5>95,</v>
<v Speaker 5>18,</v>

3408
03:25:29.310 --> 03:25:30.650
<v Speaker 5>96,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the sultan hammad,</v>

3409
03:25:31.010 --> 03:25:33.450
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did awful things and from 50,000</v>

3410
03:25:33.451 --> 03:25:36.630
<v Speaker 5>to 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>armenians died and just that one.</v>

3411
03:25:36.631 --> 03:25:38.790
<v Speaker 5>And then there was another one a couple </v>
<v Speaker 5>years later in another one,</v>

3412
03:25:38.791 --> 03:25:40.440
<v Speaker 5>a couple years after that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in 1,909,</v>

3413
03:25:40.450 --> 03:25:45.450
<v Speaker 5>there was another one and the armenians </v>
<v Speaker 5>are between a rock and a hard place </v>

3414
03:25:45.450 --> 03:25:47.700
<v Speaker 5>because part of them live in what's the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ottoman empire,</v>

3415
03:25:47.940 --> 03:25:52.940
<v Speaker 5>but part of their territory and ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 5>group extends up into southern Russia </v>

3416
03:25:52.940 --> 03:25:55.620
<v Speaker 5>and area by the way that Russia had been</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking over over the past century.</v>

3417
03:25:55.860 --> 03:25:58.170
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's sort of a battle ground area.</v>

3418
03:25:58.620 --> 03:26:03.620
<v Speaker 5>And you take this people that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ottoman turks had never been that </v>

3419
03:26:03.620 --> 03:26:05.400
<v Speaker 5>enthusiastic about any way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then you start this war.</v>

3420
03:26:05.401 --> 03:26:08.010
<v Speaker 5>Remember the russians and the turks </v>
<v Speaker 5>start fighting in late 19,</v>

3421
03:26:08.011 --> 03:26:09.110
<v Speaker 5>14,</v>
<v Speaker 5>early 1915.</v>

3422
03:26:09.120 --> 03:26:11.220
<v Speaker 5>And the turks get defeated by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>russians.</v>

3423
03:26:11.221 --> 03:26:16.221
<v Speaker 5>They have that napoleonic retreat where </v>
<v Speaker 5>the wolves are eating all the frozen </v>

3424
03:26:16.221 --> 03:26:19.041
<v Speaker 5>people and a lot of that army that beat </v>
<v Speaker 5>the turks in that battle were composed </v>

3425
03:26:19.801 --> 03:26:24.801
<v Speaker 5>of armenians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>armenians from the russian side of the </v>

3426
03:26:24.801 --> 03:26:24.801
<v Speaker 5>border,</v>

3427
03:26:26.330 --> 03:26:30.860
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of the ottoman troops in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>defeated army or also armenians.</v>

3428
03:26:31.190 --> 03:26:33.140
<v Speaker 5>And to make matters even more </v>
<v Speaker 5>complicated,</v>

3429
03:26:33.141 --> 03:26:36.950
<v Speaker 5>there were some armenian rebels who were</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to create some sort of a state of</v>

3430
03:26:36.951 --> 03:26:37.550
<v Speaker 5>their own</v>

3431
03:26:39.290 --> 03:26:44.290
<v Speaker 5>and who can blame them by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for wanting their own state after so </v>

3432
03:26:44.290 --> 03:26:47.111
<v Speaker 5>much persecution for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the way the ottoman empire viewed </v>

3433
03:26:47.111 --> 03:26:47.570
<v Speaker 5>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3434
03:26:47.571 --> 03:26:51.620
<v Speaker 5>what the best of times was unreliable </v>
<v Speaker 5>once the russians,</v>

3435
03:26:51.621 --> 03:26:53.680
<v Speaker 5>when that important battle in late 19,</v>
<v Speaker 5>14,</v>

3436
03:26:53.720 --> 03:26:56.870
<v Speaker 5>early 1915 and the turks field their </v>
<v Speaker 5>back up against the wall.</v>

3437
03:26:57.110 --> 03:27:02.110
<v Speaker 5>Now they begin to worry that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>armenians on their side of the border </v>

3438
03:27:02.110 --> 03:27:03.540
<v Speaker 5>are positively dangerous to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3439
03:27:03.560 --> 03:27:08.560
<v Speaker 5>the ones who are loyal are potentially </v>
<v Speaker 5>vulnerable to subversion or propaganda </v>

3440
03:27:09.650 --> 03:27:11.780
<v Speaker 5>or maybe even having the guerrilla </v>
<v Speaker 5>groups,</v>

3441
03:27:12.220 --> 03:27:13.190
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3442
03:27:13.191 --> 03:27:18.191
<v Speaker 5>coerce them into cooperation through age</v>
<v Speaker 5>old practices like killing collaborators</v>

3443
03:27:18.531 --> 03:27:20.930
<v Speaker 5>as it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the best case scenario.</v>

3444
03:27:21.050 --> 03:27:24.230
<v Speaker 5>Worst case scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're armenian subjects are disloyal to</v>

3445
03:27:24.231 --> 03:27:29.231
<v Speaker 5>the core and are hoping,</v>
<v Speaker 5>waiting and actively working behind the </v>

3446
03:27:29.231 --> 03:27:32.831
<v Speaker 5>scenes to help the russians when to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>turkish government.</v>

3447
03:27:32.991 --> 03:27:37.991
<v Speaker 5>This is treason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are feeling like they they're </v>

3448
03:27:37.991 --> 03:27:40.820
<v Speaker 5>either about to be or are being stabbed </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the back and their government,</v>

3449
03:27:41.020 --> 03:27:46.020
<v Speaker 5>as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never all that enthused about armenians </v>

3450
03:27:46.020 --> 03:27:48.811
<v Speaker 5>anyway decided that a solution has to be</v>
<v Speaker 5>found and their solution is to get rid </v>

3451
03:27:48.811 --> 03:27:53.011
<v Speaker 5>of the armenians.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you believe the official turkish </v>

3452
03:27:53.011 --> 03:27:56.371
<v Speaker 5>line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting rid of the armenians meant </v>

3453
03:27:56.371 --> 03:27:57.490
<v Speaker 5>relocating them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you believe what the vast majority of</v>

3454
03:27:57.520 --> 03:27:59.530
<v Speaker 5>historians and obviously armenians </v>
<v Speaker 5>believe,</v>

3455
03:27:59.890 --> 03:28:01.450
<v Speaker 5>getting rid of the meant killing them.</v>

3456
03:28:03.050 --> 03:28:06.470
<v Speaker 5>The process when it began with </v>
<v Speaker 5>systematic one village after another,</v>

3457
03:28:06.860 --> 03:28:11.860
<v Speaker 5>it was done with a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>understanding that it would be bad </v>

3458
03:28:11.860 --> 03:28:15.500
<v Speaker 5>publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Christian Powers Russia mainly,</v>

3459
03:28:15.501 --> 03:28:20.501
<v Speaker 5>but also britain and France had </v>
<v Speaker 5>oftentimes used persecution against the </v>

3460
03:28:20.501 --> 03:28:25.211
<v Speaker 5>armenians and other christian groups as </v>
<v Speaker 5>an excuse to intervene in the internal </v>

3461
03:28:25.211 --> 03:28:29.621
<v Speaker 5>affairs of the ottoman empire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the way the ottoman empire would </v>

3462
03:28:29.621 --> 03:28:29.621
<v Speaker 5>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So to them,</v>

3463
03:28:29.621 --> 03:28:33.401
<v Speaker 5>there was all the reason in the world </v>
<v Speaker 5>not to publicize that you were doing </v>

3464
03:28:33.401 --> 03:28:36.881
<v Speaker 5>this and not make a big deal out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The official line of the turkish </v>

3465
03:28:36.881 --> 03:28:40.391
<v Speaker 5>government is that during these efforts </v>
<v Speaker 5>to move the armenian people away from </v>

3466
03:28:40.391 --> 03:28:42.560
<v Speaker 5>the trouble spot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they won't be a problem if you move them</v>

3467
03:28:42.561 --> 03:28:46.310
<v Speaker 5>to say Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of them died through starvation,</v>

3468
03:28:46.580 --> 03:28:49.670
<v Speaker 5>through disease,</v>
<v Speaker 5>through hostile ethnic groups that never</v>

3469
03:28:49.671 --> 03:28:50.900
<v Speaker 5>liked them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>liked the courage,</v>

3470
03:28:50.901 --> 03:28:54.440
<v Speaker 5>deciding to take advantage and swoop in </v>
<v Speaker 5>and killed a man and raped the women and</v>

3471
03:28:54.500 --> 03:28:59.500
<v Speaker 5>all the horrible things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there's so much evidence that this </v>

3472
03:28:59.500 --> 03:29:04.481
<v Speaker 5>was done in the same sort of fashion </v>
<v Speaker 5>that any one of us would recognize </v>

3473
03:29:04.820 --> 03:29:09.820
<v Speaker 5>genocide being if it was the holocaust </v>
<v Speaker 5>or Rwanda or it really reminds one of </v>

3474
03:29:09.820 --> 03:29:14.621
<v Speaker 5>the former yugoslavia a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the turks are very sensitive about </v>

3475
03:29:14.621 --> 03:29:17.540
<v Speaker 5>this and the armenians are very angry </v>
<v Speaker 5>that they won't admit it.</v>

3476
03:29:18.140 --> 03:29:23.140
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is where I get a little upset with </v>

3477
03:29:23.140 --> 03:29:23.140
<v Speaker 5>this whole thing.</v>

3478
03:29:23.140 --> 03:29:26.850
<v Speaker 5>The idea of genocide as an official </v>
<v Speaker 5>international crime only arose in the </v>

3479
03:29:27.940 --> 03:29:29.200
<v Speaker 5>middle 19 forties.</v>

3480
03:29:30.330 --> 03:29:35.330
<v Speaker 5>And since that time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that word has become a legal hot potato </v>

3481
03:29:35.330 --> 03:29:39.920
<v Speaker 5>where it would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if someone were actually convicted of </v>

3482
03:29:39.920 --> 03:29:42.780
<v Speaker 5>genocide trigger all sorts of real world</v>
<v Speaker 5>ramifications.</v>

3483
03:29:42.930 --> 03:29:45.600
<v Speaker 5>And so everybody does everything they </v>
<v Speaker 5>can for the most part,</v>

3484
03:29:45.601 --> 03:29:49.710
<v Speaker 5>unless it's a pariah state to find </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything except genocide.</v>

3485
03:29:49.930 --> 03:29:54.930
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's hundreds of thousands of people </v>

3486
03:29:54.930 --> 03:29:54.930
<v Speaker 5>died.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3487
03:29:54.930 --> 03:29:55.890
<v Speaker 5>but it's merely a crime against humanity</v>
<v Speaker 5>because there was no intent.</v>

3488
03:29:55.940 --> 03:30:00.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's become a legalistic word where all </v>

3489
03:30:00.940 --> 03:30:03.321
<v Speaker 5>the different things have to be met and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a big deal if they are countries </v>

3490
03:30:03.321 --> 03:30:04.770
<v Speaker 5>can find themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3491
03:30:04.800 --> 03:30:09.800
<v Speaker 5>dealing with sanctions or calls for </v>
<v Speaker 5>reparations or issues with alliances or </v>

3492
03:30:09.800 --> 03:30:10.030
<v Speaker 5>trade deals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

3493
03:30:10.290 --> 03:30:12.690
<v Speaker 5>and Turkey didn't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants that.</v>

3494
03:30:12.750 --> 03:30:17.750
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even in countries that acknowledged </v>

3495
03:30:17.750 --> 03:30:20.510
<v Speaker 5>their genocidal practices at one time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were a group that have arisen in </v>

3496
03:30:20.510 --> 03:30:24.411
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are trying to get that overturned in </v>

3497
03:30:24.411 --> 03:30:24.411
<v Speaker 5>Japan.</v>

3498
03:30:24.411 --> 03:30:26.450
<v Speaker 5>There are right wing nationalists now </v>
<v Speaker 5>who are trying to now cover up and </v>

3499
03:30:26.450 --> 03:30:30.070
<v Speaker 5>downplay japanese genocidal activities </v>
<v Speaker 5>against China during the second world </v>

3500
03:30:30.070 --> 03:30:31.770
<v Speaker 5>war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the most normal thing in the world,</v>

3501
03:30:32.160 --> 03:30:37.160
<v Speaker 5>but we've all done it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why it's hard for me to </v>

3502
03:30:37.160 --> 03:30:38.320
<v Speaker 5>understand the turkish attitude that </v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a bloated,</v>

3503
03:30:38.360 --> 03:30:41.420
<v Speaker 5>their pride,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they hadn't committed the genocide,</v>

3504
03:30:41.421 --> 03:30:46.421
<v Speaker 5>they be what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like one of the only people on the </v>

3505
03:30:46.421 --> 03:30:46.421
<v Speaker 5>planet have any consequences that </v>
<v Speaker 5>hadn't.</v>

3506
03:30:47.690 --> 03:30:49.610
<v Speaker 5>It's part of the shared human </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience.</v>

3507
03:30:49.611 --> 03:30:51.290
<v Speaker 5>As sad as that sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go.</v>

3508
03:30:51.291 --> 03:30:54.710
<v Speaker 5>Look at the old testament of the bible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a book the jews,</v>

3509
03:30:54.950 --> 03:30:59.950
<v Speaker 5>christians and muslims all hold sacred.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The god of the old testament orders </v>

3510
03:31:00.590 --> 03:31:04.580
<v Speaker 5>genocide after genocide,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after genocide,</v>

3511
03:31:04.610 --> 03:31:08.120
<v Speaker 5>kill everyone put the men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>women,</v>

3512
03:31:08.270 --> 03:31:10.790
<v Speaker 5>children,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and all the animals to the sword.</v>

3513
03:31:12.230 --> 03:31:17.230
<v Speaker 5>The reason it's in the old testament is </v>
<v Speaker 5>because that was such a common behavior </v>

3514
03:31:17.230 --> 03:31:19.520
<v Speaker 5>that those people at the time would have</v>
<v Speaker 5>understood it too.</v>

3515
03:31:20.750 --> 03:31:25.750
<v Speaker 5>I've often said about slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we all have slaved blood running </v>

3516
03:31:25.750 --> 03:31:29.021
<v Speaker 5>through our ancestral veins somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>same is true for genocide.</v>

3517
03:31:29.600 --> 03:31:34.600
<v Speaker 5>We've all had ancestors who were the </v>
<v Speaker 5>victims of genocidal attacks and we've </v>

3518
03:31:34.731 --> 03:31:39.140
<v Speaker 5>all had ancestors somewhere down the </v>
<v Speaker 5>family tree who were the ones committing</v>

3519
03:31:39.141 --> 03:31:42.440
<v Speaker 5>the genocide in their book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why not killed them?</v>

3520
03:31:42.441 --> 03:31:45.740
<v Speaker 5>All professors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>daniel and clark mccauley,</v>

3521
03:31:45.741 --> 03:31:50.741
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That one of the downsides of this whole </v>

3522
03:31:50.741 --> 03:31:53.441
<v Speaker 5>thing is that we act as though that bad </v>
<v Speaker 5>man or that bad people committed this </v>

3523
03:31:54.291 --> 03:31:56.570
<v Speaker 5>unusual act when in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as they say,</v>

3524
03:31:57.110 --> 03:31:59.450
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>given the right circumstances,</v>

3525
03:31:59.660 --> 03:32:04.660
<v Speaker 5>normal human beings are all too ready to</v>
<v Speaker 5>kill by category and quote,</v>

3526
03:32:05.990 --> 03:32:10.760
<v Speaker 5>you will often hear the turks in their </v>
<v Speaker 5>own defense when accused of the armenian</v>

3527
03:32:10.761 --> 03:32:11.870
<v Speaker 5>genocide say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3528
03:32:11.960 --> 03:32:16.960
<v Speaker 5>look at what was happening to muslims </v>
<v Speaker 5>and turkish folks who were in the </v>

3529
03:32:16.960 --> 03:32:21.401
<v Speaker 5>balkans and who were being treated by </v>
<v Speaker 5>those countries that had thrown off the </v>

3530
03:32:21.401 --> 03:32:26.081
<v Speaker 5>turkish yoke to rape and murder and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>these horrible things and displacement </v>

3531
03:32:26.081 --> 03:32:30.281
<v Speaker 5>and all that is totally true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't alleviate turkish guilt </v>

3532
03:32:30.351 --> 03:32:31.610
<v Speaker 5>in the armenian situation.</v>

3533
03:32:31.610 --> 03:32:34.130
<v Speaker 5>It just adds more people to the court </v>
<v Speaker 5>docket.</v>

3534
03:32:35.060 --> 03:32:40.060
<v Speaker 5>What happeNed to the armenians and other</v>
<v Speaker 5>christians in the ottoman empire during </v>

3535
03:32:40.060 --> 03:32:41.600
<v Speaker 5>this time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including greeks and syrians,</v>

3536
03:32:42.200 --> 03:32:47.200
<v Speaker 5>was a tragedy between 500,001</v>
<v Speaker 5>point 5 million armenians died.</v>

3537
03:32:49.430 --> 03:32:50.720
<v Speaker 5>Women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>children,</v>

3538
03:32:51.260 --> 03:32:52.850
<v Speaker 5>men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>old people,</v>

3539
03:32:52.910 --> 03:32:55.040
<v Speaker 5>lots of rapes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>horrible stories.</v>

3540
03:32:55.190 --> 03:32:58.010
<v Speaker 5>Sounds like the einsatzgruppen under the</v>
<v Speaker 5>nazis.</v>

3541
03:32:58.190 --> 03:33:03.190
<v Speaker 5>Sounds like Rwanda.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sounds like Indonesia sounds most like </v>

3542
03:33:03.190 --> 03:33:06.080
<v Speaker 5>the former yugoslavia in the 19 nineties</v>
<v Speaker 5>on steroids,</v>

3543
03:33:07.430 --> 03:33:10.790
<v Speaker 5>but I don't blame the turks anymore than</v>
<v Speaker 5>I blame the rest of us for it.</v>

3544
03:33:10.791 --> 03:33:15.791
<v Speaker 5>That's human behavior and what's </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting is the armenian genocide </v>

3545
03:33:15.791 --> 03:33:20.741
<v Speaker 5>actually overshadows something similar </v>
<v Speaker 5>to it involving the russians retreating </v>

3546
03:33:20.961 --> 03:33:25.040
<v Speaker 5>in 1915 from a german offensive in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Poland and at gunpoint,</v>

3547
03:33:25.041 --> 03:33:28.010
<v Speaker 5>taking hundreds of thousands of poles </v>
<v Speaker 5>and jews out,</v>

3548
03:33:28.310 --> 03:33:30.050
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of those people never </v>
<v Speaker 5>returned.</v>

3549
03:33:30.080 --> 03:33:35.080
<v Speaker 5>They were seeing in the same way that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the armenians were seen by the turks as </v>

3550
03:33:35.080 --> 03:33:38.650
<v Speaker 5>unreliable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>disloyal elements likely to side with </v>

3551
03:33:38.650 --> 03:33:41.681
<v Speaker 5>the germans and interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a wonderful sort of karmic way,</v>

3552
03:33:42.720 --> 03:33:47.720
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the reports that are considered</v>
<v Speaker 5>to be the most reliable about what the </v>

3553
03:33:47.720 --> 03:33:50.820
<v Speaker 5>armenians were going through come from </v>
<v Speaker 5>the turks allies,</v>

3554
03:33:51.180 --> 03:33:55.720
<v Speaker 5>the germans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>chairman advisers and military officials</v>

3555
03:33:56.320 --> 03:33:59.650
<v Speaker 5>and ambassadors who are telling their </v>
<v Speaker 5>own government about the terrible things</v>

3556
03:33:59.651 --> 03:34:03.190
<v Speaker 5>that are happening to the armenians in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that country.</v>

3557
03:34:03.640 --> 03:34:08.640
<v Speaker 5>And then within a generation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those stories will be coming out of </v>

3558
03:34:08.640 --> 03:34:08.640
<v Speaker 5>Germany.</v>

3559
03:34:09.940 --> 03:34:14.940
<v Speaker 5>That's how endemic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This whole idea of killing your enemies </v>

3560
03:34:15.401 --> 03:34:20.330
<v Speaker 5>down to the last person are as terrible </v>
<v Speaker 5>as this is.</v>

3561
03:34:20.720 --> 03:34:23.300
<v Speaker 5>That's the way we are as human beings</v>

3562
03:34:25.120 --> 03:34:30.120
<v Speaker 1>and killing your enemies down to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last person is not just beginning to </v>

3563
03:34:31.481 --> 03:34:36.481
<v Speaker 1>look like the equation in these horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal genocides and starting to look </v>

3564
03:34:37.121 --> 03:34:41.170
<v Speaker 1>like the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know in that algebraic problem.</v>

3565
03:34:41.230 --> 03:34:46.230
<v Speaker 1>If you're one of the military commanders</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this conflict of how you win the war </v>

3566
03:34:46.230 --> 03:34:47.380
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not killing every man,</v>

3567
03:34:47.381 --> 03:34:52.381
<v Speaker 1>woman and child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just killing every soldier on the other </v>

3568
03:34:52.381 --> 03:34:52.381
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

3569
03:34:52.560 --> 03:34:57.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after another horrible battle on the </v>

3570
03:34:57.560 --> 03:35:00.261
<v Speaker 1>western front in 1915 when the allies </v>
<v Speaker 1>lose a ton of people to gain literally </v>

3571
03:35:00.261 --> 03:35:04.851
<v Speaker 1>not an inch of territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The french general baton becomes one of </v>

3572
03:35:04.851 --> 03:35:08.691
<v Speaker 1>the first ally commanders to openly say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this war is not going to be won by </v>

3573
03:35:08.691 --> 03:35:12.741
<v Speaker 1>some miraculous breakthrough or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>tactical or strategic bit of brilliance </v>

3574
03:35:12.811 --> 03:35:15.630
<v Speaker 1>that opens up into a flank or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakthrough.</v>

3575
03:35:15.900 --> 03:35:20.400
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be won by killing more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the enemy than we lose ourselves.</v>

3576
03:35:21.180 --> 03:35:26.180
<v Speaker 1>The wars turning into a war of attrition</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while that might sound like an </v>

3577
03:35:26.180 --> 03:35:29.040
<v Speaker 1>ultimate allied victory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if everybody kills,</v>

3578
03:35:29.400 --> 03:35:32.220
<v Speaker 1>you know one person on the other side </v>
<v Speaker 1>until there no one left.</v>

3579
03:35:32.221 --> 03:35:35.010
<v Speaker 1>The allies have a lot more people than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the central powers.</v>

3580
03:35:35.400 --> 03:35:40.400
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics is that the central powers </v>

3581
03:35:40.400 --> 03:35:44.210
<v Speaker 1>are killing more allied troops and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're losing themselves and will do so</v>

3582
03:35:44.310 --> 03:35:47.670
<v Speaker 1>every single month until almost the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the war.</v>

3583
03:35:48.210 --> 03:35:53.130
<v Speaker 1>So that mathematical equation is as yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsolved and unpredictable.</v>

3584
03:35:54.090 --> 03:35:59.090
<v Speaker 1>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern nations don't fight to the last </v>

3585
03:35:59.090 --> 03:36:00.810
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At some point they cry uncle,</v>

3586
03:36:01.350 --> 03:36:06.350
<v Speaker 1>which in this conflict has been ruled </v>
<v Speaker 1>out by the allies signing those treaty </v>

3587
03:36:06.350 --> 03:36:07.020
<v Speaker 1>saying no one will make a separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece,</v>

3588
03:36:07.470 --> 03:36:12.470
<v Speaker 1>which means they'll fight until the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political system or the armies or the </v>

3589
03:36:13.861 --> 03:36:16.860
<v Speaker 1>will of the soldiers to resist </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapses.</v>

3590
03:36:17.640 --> 03:36:22.640
<v Speaker 1>And by the end of 1915,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a coupLe of countries that look </v>

3591
03:36:22.640 --> 03:36:25.170
<v Speaker 1>in real danger of having that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even the countries that look quite a</v>

3592
03:36:25.171 --> 03:36:28.170
<v Speaker 1>bit safer than Austria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungary or Russia.</v>

3593
03:36:28.171 --> 03:36:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even they are showing,</v>

3594
03:36:31.070 --> 03:36:32.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cracks and vulnerabilities.</v>

3595
03:36:32.911 --> 03:36:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Can this war really go on for another </v>
<v Speaker 1>year?</v>

3596
03:36:37.500 --> 03:36:42.500
<v Speaker 1>It's going to go on longer than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not everyone is going to make it to </v>

3597
03:36:42.500 --> 03:36:42.500
<v Speaker 1>the end.</v>

3598

3606
03:37:14.910 --> 03:37:19.120
<v Speaker 1>like alice susanna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the child prodigy and </v>

3607
03:37:19.791 --> 03:37:24.791
<v Speaker 1>genius musical composer mozart is </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to have answered when someone </v>

3608
03:37:24.791 --> 03:37:29.531
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you come up with your </v>

3609
03:37:29.531 --> 03:37:29.600
<v Speaker 1>compositions in a start with the piano </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then build off of that,</v>

3610
03:37:29.601 --> 03:37:31.550
<v Speaker 1>or do you start with the structure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then fill in the middle or.</v>

3611
03:37:31.760 --> 03:37:34.100
<v Speaker 1>and he's supposed to have said that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to him.</v>

3612
03:37:34.530 --> 03:37:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Gleick alice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suzanne amman at the same time all </v>

3613
03:37:39.530 --> 03:37:42.640
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that phrase keeps popping into my </v>

3614
03:37:42.640 --> 03:37:45.611
<v Speaker 1>head because that's the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge in telling this first world </v>

3615
03:37:45.611 --> 03:37:49.511
<v Speaker 1>war story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second biggest challenge is the </v>

3616
03:37:49.511 --> 03:37:51.820
<v Speaker 1>ungodly amount of material that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced from many different countries </v>

3617
03:37:51.820 --> 03:37:56.621
<v Speaker 1>and viewpoints about this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been so overwhelmed with </v>

3618
03:37:56.621 --> 03:37:58.640
<v Speaker 1>material as I have been for this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all controversial,</v>

3619
03:37:58.641 --> 03:38:03.641
<v Speaker 1>so you really need to read a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different authors and viewpoints to to </v>

3620
03:38:03.641 --> 03:38:07.160
<v Speaker 1>get a sort of a nice broad view of some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these topics.</v>

3621
03:38:07.670 --> 03:38:12.670
<v Speaker 1>But the stories can't even be </v>
<v Speaker 1>compartmentalized because they affect </v>

3622
03:38:12.670 --> 03:38:15.641
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on in the eastern front </v>

3623
03:38:15.641 --> 03:38:18.041
<v Speaker 1>affects outcomes on the western front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which affect outcomes in the </v>

3624
03:38:18.041 --> 03:38:21.371
<v Speaker 1>mediterranean theatre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can't even tell the stories </v>

3625
03:38:21.371 --> 03:38:26.040
<v Speaker 1>and the separately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all have to kind of weave together </v>

3626
03:38:26.040 --> 03:38:28.070
<v Speaker 1>and it's really easy with this much </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on to lose track of the story.</v>

3627
03:38:29.030 --> 03:38:34.030
<v Speaker 1>So I thought we would have a rare little</v>
<v Speaker 1>recap as to where we are right now.</v>

3628
03:38:34.521 --> 03:38:39.521
<v Speaker 1>Sort of broad trends to get us up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speed and a few thoughts from the last </v>

3629
03:38:39.711 --> 03:38:43.490
<v Speaker 1>show that I'd like to just throw in </v>
<v Speaker 1>little extra fluff here at the end,</v>

3630
03:38:43.491 --> 03:38:48.491
<v Speaker 1>no extra charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just bring us up to speed and make sure </v>

3631
03:38:48.491 --> 03:38:51.851
<v Speaker 1>I've covered them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a list of things I want to make </v>

3632
03:38:51.851 --> 03:38:51.851
<v Speaker 1>sure I get through.</v>

3633
03:38:51.851 --> 03:38:53.020
<v Speaker 1>I'd hate to get through this whole show </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

3634
03:38:53.080 --> 03:38:54.580
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left that out.</v>

3635
03:38:55.930 --> 03:39:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are quick recap can be done relatively </v>

3636
03:39:00.930 --> 03:39:01.780
<v Speaker 1>simply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The war breaks out in august,</v>

3637
03:39:01.781 --> 03:39:02.830
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14.</v>

3638
03:39:03.340 --> 03:39:05.470
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of these countries had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>ready for it,</v>

3639
03:39:05.471 --> 03:39:07.480
<v Speaker 1>predicting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They mobilized quickly.</v>

3640
03:39:07.481 --> 03:39:10.270
<v Speaker 1>It's all on a timescale and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>launches.</v>

3641
03:39:10.271 --> 03:39:15.271
<v Speaker 1>They're prewar battle plans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which for the germans is most famously </v>

3642
03:39:15.271 --> 03:39:18.010
<v Speaker 1>called the schlieffen plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced through Belgium in a wide arc.</v>

3643
03:39:18.280 --> 03:39:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Smash the french armies on the head </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're keeping them occupied to </v>

3644
03:39:23.280 --> 03:39:25.630
<v Speaker 1>the front as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't go too well.</v>

3645
03:39:25.930 --> 03:39:27.460
<v Speaker 1>It does for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the.</v>

3646
03:39:27.510 --> 03:39:32.510
<v Speaker 1>The armies clash and the first month of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the war is commonly referred to as the </v>

3647
03:39:32.510 --> 03:39:37.201
<v Speaker 1>battle of the frontiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get these 19th century tactics </v>

3648
03:39:37.201 --> 03:39:40.400
<v Speaker 1>running into 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanized warfare,</v>

3649
03:39:40.760 --> 03:39:44.450
<v Speaker 1>which leads to the worst single month in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of casualties that you're going to</v>

3650
03:39:44.451 --> 03:39:49.451
<v Speaker 1>get in the whole war because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to see a lot of cavalry charges </v>

3651
03:39:49.911 --> 03:39:54.911
<v Speaker 1>against machine guns and artillery </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions after the first month of the </v>

3652
03:39:54.911 --> 03:39:54.911
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

3653
03:39:54.911 --> 03:39:59.000
<v Speaker 1>That's when the really mindblowingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>shocking things.</v>

3654
03:39:59.001 --> 03:40:03.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean guys with armor and swords and </v>
<v Speaker 1>white gloves and red pants and you know,</v>

3655
03:40:03.210 --> 03:40:04.430
<v Speaker 1>bayonet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>charging,</v>

3656
03:40:04.460 --> 03:40:09.460
<v Speaker 1>prepared positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole thing is is cookie and </v>

3657
03:40:09.460 --> 03:40:10.700
<v Speaker 1>that lasts for about a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next month is what happens after the</v>

3658
03:40:10.701 --> 03:40:15.701
<v Speaker 1>germans lose the battle of the marne and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there schlieffen plan is broken and so </v>

3659
03:40:15.701 --> 03:40:20.291
<v Speaker 1>the second month of the wars then </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically running away from their </v>

3660
03:40:20.291 --> 03:40:21.290
<v Speaker 1>earlier positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to find a place to regroup,</v>

3661
03:40:21.410 --> 03:40:26.410
<v Speaker 1>finding a really good place to regroup </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of the river ane and </v>

3662
03:40:26.410 --> 03:40:29.180
<v Speaker 1>digging in and the allies following </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

3663
03:40:29.540 --> 03:40:34.540
<v Speaker 1>unable to take those wonderful positions</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of the river ane and </v>

3664
03:40:34.540 --> 03:40:38.660
<v Speaker 1>digging in themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inaugurating officially trench warfare.</v>

3665
03:40:39.710 --> 03:40:41.840
<v Speaker 1>then you have the so called race to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sea.</v>

3666
03:40:42.110 --> 03:40:47.110
<v Speaker 1>When the germans and the french and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>british who don't want to run into each </v>

3667
03:40:47.110 --> 03:40:48.530
<v Speaker 1>other's prepared defenses anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start trying to find a flank in the only</v>

3668
03:40:48.560 --> 03:40:53.560
<v Speaker 1>open part of the battle line left from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the river ane up north towards the see </v>

3669
03:40:54.530 --> 03:40:57.710
<v Speaker 1>both sides reached the sea before they </v>
<v Speaker 1>find a flag.</v>

3670
03:40:58.040 --> 03:41:03.040
<v Speaker 1>They have a couple of terrible battles </v>
<v Speaker 1>including the first battle of april up </v>

3671
03:41:03.040 --> 03:41:06.701
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we settled down to the 1915 </v>

3672
03:41:06.701 --> 03:41:11.081
<v Speaker 1>warfare basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is going to involve both sides </v>

3673
03:41:11.081 --> 03:41:13.890
<v Speaker 1>launching offensives that don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything and that if you read the book,</v>

3674
03:41:13.891 --> 03:41:15.620
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they can make them exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3675
03:41:15.621 --> 03:41:18.800
<v Speaker 1>they almost broke through and all if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've only been modern communication,</v>

3676
03:41:19.130 --> 03:41:24.130
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom line is thE bottom line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a bunch of battles during 1915 </v>

3677
03:41:24.130 --> 03:41:27.230
<v Speaker 1>on the western front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing changes on the eastern front.</v>

3678
03:41:27.500 --> 03:41:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Nothing changes either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of movement happens.</v>

3679
03:41:31.280 --> 03:41:33.440
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of movement happens.</v>

3680
03:41:33.740 --> 03:41:38.740
<v Speaker 1>The overall strategic situation remains </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same because when the russians and </v>

3681
03:41:38.740 --> 03:41:40.220
<v Speaker 1>the germans clash right at the war </v>
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>

3682
03:41:40.221 --> 03:41:42.770
<v Speaker 1>the russians get crushed in the couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of big battles.</v>

3683
03:41:42.771 --> 03:41:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Tannenberg mazarine lakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then they beat the ostroW,</v>

3684
03:41:45.951 --> 03:41:47.710
<v Speaker 1>hungarians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the serbians beat,</v>

3685
03:41:47.711 --> 03:41:52.711
<v Speaker 1>the austro-hungarian whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff happens when you turn around and </v>

3686
03:41:52.711 --> 03:41:53.870
<v Speaker 1>subtract all the deaths and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement and everything else.</v>

3687
03:41:53.870 --> 03:41:56.840
<v Speaker 1>The situation is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The russians are there,</v>

3688
03:41:57.020 --> 03:42:00.680
<v Speaker 1>they're not defeated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can replace all their losses and if</v>

3689
03:42:00.681 --> 03:42:05.681
<v Speaker 1>you really want to chase them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll run all the way back to moscow </v>

3690
03:42:05.681 --> 03:42:06.410
<v Speaker 1>like they did against napoleon and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do against hitler.</v>

3691
03:42:06.500 --> 03:42:11.500
<v Speaker 1>And do you really want to follow them </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way back there so they don't </v>

3692
03:42:11.500 --> 03:42:13.880
<v Speaker 1>have trench warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have movement warfare,</v>

3693
03:42:14.180 --> 03:42:17.360
<v Speaker 1>but the movement's not ending anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>

3694
03:42:17.600 --> 03:42:21.170
<v Speaker 1>because the russians and the turks start</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting into it down in the south,</v>

3695
03:42:21.590 --> 03:42:26.590
<v Speaker 1>the russians asked the allies for help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which leads to winston churchill's </v>

3696
03:42:26.590 --> 03:42:30.161
<v Speaker 1>cabal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having yet another good argument to </v>

3697
03:42:30.161 --> 03:42:32.501
<v Speaker 1>argue that maybe we should take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dardanelles with all these pre </v>

3698
03:42:32.501 --> 03:42:33.630
<v Speaker 1>dreadnought battleships and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dardanelles happen.</v>

3699
03:42:33.870 --> 03:42:36.300
<v Speaker 1>Now here's where we can kind of add the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluff.</v>

3700
03:42:36.301 --> 03:42:41.301
<v Speaker 1>I was just promising you because </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember one of the sidebar hopes with </v>

3701
03:42:41.301 --> 03:42:45.741
<v Speaker 1>this dardanelles campaign is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>might influence some of those countries </v>

3702
03:42:45.741 --> 03:42:48.180
<v Speaker 1>down in that region that hadn't decided </v>
<v Speaker 1>which side to join yet,</v>

3703
03:42:48.181 --> 03:42:50.550
<v Speaker 1>but it was obvious that they were sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of taking bids,</v>

3704
03:42:50.820 --> 03:42:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Italy most among them.</v>

3705
03:42:52.440 --> 03:42:57.440
<v Speaker 1>They liked the allied bead better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They saw the dardanelles campaign </v>

3706
03:42:57.440 --> 03:42:58.800
<v Speaker 1>looking pretty strong back in may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

3707
03:42:58.801 --> 03:43:03.801
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when there were landings and </v>

3708
03:43:03.801 --> 03:43:05.601
<v Speaker 1>troops assaulting the heights every day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it looked like britain and France </v>

3709
03:43:05.601 --> 03:43:06.210
<v Speaker 1>were strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the italians joined the war.</v>

3710
03:43:06.720 --> 03:43:11.720
<v Speaker 1>They instantly attack the ostrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungarians at really the only good spot </v>

3711
03:43:11.720 --> 03:43:16.020
<v Speaker 1>on their board or to do that because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of their borders basically the alps</v>

3712
03:43:16.320 --> 03:43:18.870
<v Speaker 1>and basically the austro-hungarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungarians have the high ground.</v>

3713
03:43:18.871 --> 03:43:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Although they find and have found </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

3714
03:43:21.751 --> 03:43:26.751
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like something out of the </v>

3715
03:43:26.751 --> 03:43:26.751
<v Speaker 1>old captain America comic books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3716
03:43:26.751 --> 03:43:31.311
<v Speaker 1>with captain America frozen in the snow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>except of course he was alive when they </v>

3717
03:43:31.311 --> 03:43:35.220
<v Speaker 1>defrosted them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These poor austrian and italian soldiers</v>

3718
03:43:35.221 --> 03:43:38.400
<v Speaker 1>that they're finding with these glaciers</v>
<v Speaker 1>melting up in the alps,</v>

3719
03:43:38.670 --> 03:43:43.670
<v Speaker 1>in these caves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean they look perfect like they </v>

3720
03:43:43.670 --> 03:43:43.670
<v Speaker 1>were frozen yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their uniforms,</v>

3721
03:43:43.670 --> 03:43:46.020
<v Speaker 1>their weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their facial characteristics,</v>

3722
03:43:46.021 --> 03:43:46.530
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

3723
03:43:46.530 --> 03:43:47.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

3724
03:43:47.461 --> 03:43:51.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like a time capsule of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>grotesque kind.</v>

3725
03:43:52.200 --> 03:43:54.660
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one area that's good for fighting at</v>

3726
03:43:54.661 --> 03:43:56.800
<v Speaker 1>least compared to the alps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is on the river.</v>

3727
03:43:56.801 --> 03:44:01.801
<v Speaker 1>He songs though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the italians attack the </v>

3728
03:44:01.801 --> 03:44:02.610
<v Speaker 1>austro-hungarian right away at the river</v>
<v Speaker 1>is sancho and lose.</v>

3729
03:44:03.090 --> 03:44:05.160
<v Speaker 1>So then they attack agaIn on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>riversand.</v>

3730
03:44:05.260 --> 03:44:07.600
<v Speaker 1>So this will be called the second battle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the riversand.</v>

3731
03:44:07.610 --> 03:44:09.780
<v Speaker 1>So when they lose again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it again.</v>

3732
03:44:09.810 --> 03:44:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Third battle of the riversand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they do it again.</v>

3733
03:44:11.941 --> 03:44:16.941
<v Speaker 1>The fourth battle of the river.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the last year of the award there </v>

3734
03:44:16.941 --> 03:44:20.061
<v Speaker 1>on the twelfth battle of the reverse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monzo and hundreds of thousands have </v>

3735
03:44:20.061 --> 03:44:21.120
<v Speaker 1>died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

3736
03:44:21.300 --> 03:44:24.960
<v Speaker 1>in only six months of warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the italians will have 200,000</v>

3737
03:44:24.961 --> 03:44:29.340
<v Speaker 1>casualties and are quickly playing catch</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with the rest of the powers.</v>

3738
03:44:29.490 --> 03:44:31.410
<v Speaker 1>I should point out something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties to.</v>

3739
03:44:31.411 --> 03:44:33.690
<v Speaker 1>We keep using that term and it's worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>defining it.</v>

3740
03:44:34.230 --> 03:44:36.990
<v Speaker 1>casualties is a military term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as many of you know,</v>

3741
03:44:37.200 --> 03:44:39.890
<v Speaker 1>and it's simply refers to the loss of </v>
<v Speaker 1>battles.</v>

3742
03:44:39.891 --> 03:44:44.891
<v Speaker 1>StrenGth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a general and it's your </v>

3743
03:44:44.891 --> 03:44:44.891
<v Speaker 1>army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about casualties,</v>

3744
03:44:44.891 --> 03:44:49.481
<v Speaker 1>simply means the number of people you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have available to fight those </v>

3745
03:44:49.481 --> 03:44:51.150
<v Speaker 1>who'd been killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who have been wounded,</v>

3746
03:44:51.300 --> 03:44:53.610
<v Speaker 1>those who have been captured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those who are missing.</v>

3747
03:44:53.880 --> 03:44:56.490
<v Speaker 1>So when I say casualties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it means.</v>

3748
03:44:56.491 --> 03:44:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Although missing in this war usually </v>
<v Speaker 1>means dead.</v>

3749
03:44:59.070 --> 03:45:00.330
<v Speaker 1>If I say dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3750
03:45:00.690 --> 03:45:04.320
<v Speaker 1>that means killed in action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the italians,</v>

3751
03:45:04.321 --> 03:45:06.210
<v Speaker 1>200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties within six months,</v>

3752
03:45:06.510 --> 03:45:09.540
<v Speaker 1>the other power that gets into the war </v>
<v Speaker 1>does so in october,</v>

3753
03:45:09.840 --> 03:45:14.840
<v Speaker 1>and it's the bulgarians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another one of these powers that </v>

3754
03:45:14.840 --> 03:45:17.511
<v Speaker 1>churchill and his friends at hope to </v>
<v Speaker 1>convince to join the allied side when </v>

3755
03:45:17.511 --> 03:45:18.240
<v Speaker 1>they saw how the dardanelles campaign </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going,</v>

3756
03:45:18.241 --> 03:45:23.241
<v Speaker 1>but by october the dardanelles campaigns</v>
<v Speaker 1>really going poorly and the bulgarians </v>

3757
03:45:23.241 --> 03:45:25.500
<v Speaker 1>had been promised good land and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't like the serbs anyway.</v>

3758
03:45:25.590 --> 03:45:28.140
<v Speaker 1>So they joined with the germans and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>austrian hungarians,</v>

3759
03:45:28.260 --> 03:45:30.640
<v Speaker 1>all three of them promptly attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>Serbia,</v>

3760
03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:33.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and knock them out of the war.</v>

3761
03:45:33.310 --> 03:45:38.310
<v Speaker 1>And there'll be this story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this harrowing story of the serbian </v>

3762
03:45:38.310 --> 03:45:38.310
<v Speaker 1>army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3763
03:45:38.310 --> 03:45:42.990
<v Speaker 1>going all the way through Albania and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mountain passes like a bunch of </v>

3764
03:45:42.990 --> 03:45:44.290
<v Speaker 1>wraiths starving until they reached the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sea.</v>

3765
03:45:44.291 --> 03:45:47.650
<v Speaker 1>And there'll be evacuated by french and </v>
<v Speaker 1>british warships to fight another day.</v>

3766
03:45:49.050 --> 03:45:51.330
<v Speaker 1>The one thing I wasn't sure if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned in the story,</v>

3767
03:45:51.370 --> 03:45:52.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about the second battle of eep</v>

3768
03:45:52.981 --> 03:45:57.550
<v Speaker 1>or where the germans used poison gas for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time in a successful way.</v>

3769
03:45:57.551 --> 03:45:59.740
<v Speaker 1>It was used on the eastern front in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird way once,</v>

3770
03:46:00.090 --> 03:46:05.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but after the second battle of eep are </v>

3771
03:46:05.090 --> 03:46:05.500
<v Speaker 1>the allies start using gas to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the end of 1915,</v>

3772
03:46:05.770 --> 03:46:10.770
<v Speaker 1>the standard mix of shells is you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>some high explosive in your mix and you </v>

3773
03:46:10.770 --> 03:46:15.511
<v Speaker 1>want some shrapnel shells and your mix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are like giant balls filled with </v>

3774
03:46:15.511 --> 03:46:18.991
<v Speaker 1>tiny little beebees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they explode it's like a giant </v>

3775
03:46:18.991 --> 03:46:21.901
<v Speaker 1>hand grenade going off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the last gels you want mixed </v>

3776
03:46:21.901 --> 03:46:22.480
<v Speaker 1>into your little triad of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3777
03:46:22.860 --> 03:46:25.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific ness are your gas shell.</v>

3778
03:46:25.041 --> 03:46:26.800
<v Speaker 1>So gas high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explosive in shrapnel.</v>

3779
03:46:26.801 --> 03:46:30.400
<v Speaker 1>You shoot it all at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes a nasty little cocktail for the</v>

3780
03:46:30.401 --> 03:46:31.510
<v Speaker 1>poor troops on the ground,</v>

3781
03:46:32.550 --> 03:46:37.550
<v Speaker 1>so everyone's got gas and everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing gas masks now and you end up </v>

3782
03:46:37.550 --> 03:46:39.300
<v Speaker 1>with these images that are still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my mind,</v>

3783
03:46:39.360 --> 03:46:44.360
<v Speaker 1>the greatest images of the first world </v>
<v Speaker 1>war because they say the most when </v>

3784
03:46:44.360 --> 03:46:44.360
<v Speaker 1>you'll see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

3785
03:46:44.360 --> 03:46:48.390
<v Speaker 1>I love the one that shows a german </v>
<v Speaker 1>cavalry,</v>

3786
03:46:48.420 --> 03:46:53.420
<v Speaker 1>lancer in 1969,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1917 who's wearing the stall helm,</v>

3787
03:46:54.421 --> 03:46:59.421
<v Speaker 1>which will come into vogue in 1916,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the same basic </v>

3788
03:46:59.421 --> 03:47:03.771
<v Speaker 1>design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see the german army having the </v>

3789
03:47:03.771 --> 03:47:05.451
<v Speaker 1>second world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's wearing like a german wehrmacht </v>

3790
03:47:05.451 --> 03:47:08.361
<v Speaker 1>helmet with a lance on a horse and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing a gas mask.</v>

3791
03:47:08.940 --> 03:47:13.940
<v Speaker 1>He's like half medieval knighT and half </v>
<v Speaker 1>storm trooper from star wars and that to</v>

3792
03:47:14.701 --> 03:47:19.701
<v Speaker 1>me encapsulates what this war is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These meetinGs of the modern world with </v>

3793
03:47:19.701 --> 03:47:22.020
<v Speaker 1>the premodern world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a historical estuary,</v>

3794
03:47:22.021 --> 03:47:24.570
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>

3795
03:47:24.840 --> 03:47:29.840
<v Speaker 1>you know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's uber modern because really there </v>

3796
03:47:29.840 --> 03:47:31.770
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been a major war fought with gas </v>
<v Speaker 1>since this time period.</v>

3797
03:47:31.771 --> 03:47:36.771
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been incidents of chemical </v>

3798
03:47:36.771 --> 03:47:36.771
<v Speaker 1>weapons and gas use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've never had the major.</v>

3799
03:47:36.771 --> 03:47:38.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean the second world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was none of this.</v>

3800
03:47:39.910 --> 03:47:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be obvious that there have </v>

3801
03:47:44.910 --> 03:47:46.441
<v Speaker 1>been several theaters that have not </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten much or perhaps any attention </v>

3802
03:47:46.441 --> 03:47:50.520
<v Speaker 1>from yours truly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not because I don't find them </v>

3803
03:47:50.520 --> 03:47:53.640
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think you could do a whole </v>

3804
03:47:53.640 --> 03:47:55.300
<v Speaker 1>podcast just on the african experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first world war,</v>

3805
03:47:55.690 --> 03:47:59.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's not important to the outcome of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first world war.</v>

3806
03:47:59.111 --> 03:48:01.330
<v Speaker 1>So when you have to chop in places for </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

3807
03:48:01.331 --> 03:48:04.660
<v Speaker 1>these are long enough already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You naturally look at the pacific in the</v>

3808
03:48:04.661 --> 03:48:08.080
<v Speaker 1>first world war or africa because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't affect the outcome.</v>

3809
03:48:08.590 --> 03:48:13.590
<v Speaker 1>What had more of an effect on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome are the soldiers from those two </v>

3810
03:48:13.590 --> 03:48:17.890
<v Speaker 1>areas that were trucked into places like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the western front and who fought there.</v>

3811
03:48:18.220 --> 03:48:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Lots of north africans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of subsaharan africans,</v>

3812
03:48:21.790 --> 03:48:26.790
<v Speaker 1>lots of people from the far east fought </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the western front and at places like </v>

3813
03:48:26.790 --> 03:48:30.230
<v Speaker 1>the dardanelles and eventually at slomka</v>
<v Speaker 1>and places like that.</v>

3814
03:48:30.530 --> 03:48:35.530
<v Speaker 1>So in a funny way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place where africans and asians had </v>

3815
03:48:35.901 --> 03:48:40.901
<v Speaker 1>the most impact on the war going one way</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the other was the same western front </v>

3816
03:48:41.180 --> 03:48:46.180
<v Speaker 1>that we normally think of as being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>british french canadian sort of preserve</v>

3817
03:48:46.521 --> 03:48:51.521
<v Speaker 1>and down the road and american one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so by the end of 1915 you basically have</v>

3818
03:48:53.961 --> 03:48:57.500
<v Speaker 1>a static situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>western front stays unchanged.</v>

3819
03:48:57.710 --> 03:49:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Eastern front keeps moving around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody's still standing there </v>

3820
03:49:02.710 --> 03:49:06.410
<v Speaker 1>facing each other down in Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The war has been extended to down there,</v>

3821
03:49:06.411 --> 03:49:11.411
<v Speaker 1>but it's just stable to one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons this is called the gear of </v>

3822
03:49:11.411 --> 03:49:15.941
<v Speaker 1>stalemate in the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to talk about something new </v>

3823
03:49:15.941 --> 03:49:17.630
<v Speaker 1>that has happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helmets have started arriving.</v>

3824
03:49:18.320 --> 03:49:20.480
<v Speaker 1>We mentioned the german stall helm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute ago.</v>

3825
03:49:20.630 --> 03:49:25.630
<v Speaker 1>The first one is the french helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the british metal helmet than the </v>

3826
03:49:25.630 --> 03:49:28.901
<v Speaker 1>german one appears and it's one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that doesn't seem like a big </v>

3827
03:49:28.901 --> 03:49:32.771
<v Speaker 1>deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of those helmet designs will be </v>

3828
03:49:32.771 --> 03:49:33.860
<v Speaker 1>the basic design that the second world </v>
<v Speaker 1>war helmets come from.</v>

3829
03:49:34.040 --> 03:49:37.730
<v Speaker 1>So they'll all look very familiar and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>in vogue for quite a while.</v>

3830
03:49:37.731 --> 03:49:40.070
<v Speaker 1>At least in their basic look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the german one changes,</v>

3831
03:49:40.071 --> 03:49:41.390
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all change a little,</v>

3832
03:49:42.380 --> 03:49:45.680
<v Speaker 1>but also because it boggles the mind a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

3833
03:49:45.710 --> 03:49:50.710
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't get your first metal </v>

3834
03:49:50.710 --> 03:49:53.081
<v Speaker 1>helmet really till late 1915,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means all these people have been </v>

3835
03:49:53.081 --> 03:49:57.551
<v Speaker 1>fighting the most artillery intensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>war in human history by far with cloth </v>

3836
03:49:59.420 --> 03:50:04.420
<v Speaker 1>hats on their heads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>digging holes in the ground where the </v>

3837
03:50:04.911 --> 03:50:09.911
<v Speaker 1>only thing that's exposed to fire is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of your head and it's covered by a </v>

3838
03:50:10.311 --> 03:50:15.311
<v Speaker 1>hat and forget the obvious thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>like shrapnel exploding in the air and </v>

3839
03:50:15.311 --> 03:50:20.000
<v Speaker 1>just hitting you in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many of these shells don't come all </v>

3840
03:50:20.000 --> 03:50:23.591
<v Speaker 1>that close to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just Blow tons of rocks and stuff </v>

3841
03:50:23.591 --> 03:50:25.430
<v Speaker 1>up in the air that then come down and </v>
<v Speaker 1>land on your head.</v>

3842
03:50:26.240 --> 03:50:31.240
<v Speaker 1>How many casualties from the first year </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the war could you attribute to the </v>

3843
03:50:31.641 --> 03:50:33.410
<v Speaker 1>fact that none of these troops had metal</v>
<v Speaker 1>helmets?</v>

3844
03:50:33.411 --> 03:50:38.411
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to think about and crazy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that it took them a year to come </v>

3845
03:50:38.411 --> 03:50:39.350
<v Speaker 1>up with that more than a year.</v>

3846
03:50:41.720 --> 03:50:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this firmly belonGs in the </v>

3847
03:50:46.720 --> 03:50:47.180
<v Speaker 1>casualty area when we're discussing </v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties,</v>

3848
03:50:47.960 --> 03:50:52.100
<v Speaker 1>modern medicine has changed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation at this conflict and if you're</v>

3849
03:50:52.220 --> 03:50:57.220
<v Speaker 1>studying military history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll notice a very interesting change </v>

3850
03:50:57.220 --> 03:51:01.781
<v Speaker 1>in the way the casualty death too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wounded figures show up in this </v>

3851
03:51:01.781 --> 03:51:05.381
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm normally the number of people </v>

3852
03:51:05.381 --> 03:51:07.460
<v Speaker 1>wounded and the number of people who die</v>
<v Speaker 1>are pretty close together.</v>

3853
03:51:07.490 --> 03:51:10.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean take the crimean war that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in the 18 fifties.</v>

3854
03:51:10.610 --> 03:51:14.960
<v Speaker 1>More people died from disease than from </v>
<v Speaker 1>combat related wounds.</v>

3855
03:51:14.961 --> 03:51:19.961
<v Speaker 1>That might've been a little extreme but </v>
<v Speaker 1>not that far off the norm by the first </v>

3856
03:51:19.961 --> 03:51:24.251
<v Speaker 1>world war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That changes immensely and it's because </v>

3857
03:51:24.251 --> 03:51:25.650
<v Speaker 1>the medical situation has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionized.</v>

3858
03:51:25.680 --> 03:51:30.680
<v Speaker 1>modern military medicine really begins </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first world war and a lot of </v>

3859
03:51:30.680 --> 03:51:31.920
<v Speaker 1>these doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially on the western front,</v>

3860
03:51:32.220 --> 03:51:37.220
<v Speaker 1>our doctors from private practice who </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been drafted or who joined and </v>

3861
03:51:37.220 --> 03:51:40.140
<v Speaker 1>volunteered for the war effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're often doing surgeries right near</v>

3862
03:51:40.141 --> 03:51:40.650
<v Speaker 1>the front.</v>

3863
03:51:40.980 --> 03:51:43.080
<v Speaker 1>These are people who live in the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>

3864
03:51:43.081 --> 03:51:48.081
<v Speaker 1>When medIcine is starting to be pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>darn good and it completely changes the </v>

3865
03:51:48.081 --> 03:51:48.081
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3866
03:51:48.081 --> 03:51:52.971
<v Speaker 1>these people are not just able to save </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives and this is sort of a mixed </v>

3867
03:51:52.971 --> 03:51:52.980
<v Speaker 1>blessing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you're a soldier,</v>

3868
03:51:53.220 --> 03:51:58.220
<v Speaker 1>but they will be able for the nation </v>
<v Speaker 1>states that they work for to send a lot </v>

3869
03:51:58.220 --> 03:52:02.421
<v Speaker 1>of these damaged soldiers back to fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>again another day and sometimes multiple</v>

3870
03:52:03.121 --> 03:52:08.121
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That ends up increasing the ability of </v>

3871
03:52:08.121 --> 03:52:11.991
<v Speaker 1>many of these states to keep fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>past where they otherwise would have </v>

3872
03:52:11.991 --> 03:52:12.990
<v Speaker 1>been able to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all you have to do for example,</v>

3873
03:52:12.991 --> 03:52:15.060
<v Speaker 1>is look at the burn rate on some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these armies.</v>

3874
03:52:15.420 --> 03:52:18.720
<v Speaker 1>By the end of 1915.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By October,</v>

3875
03:52:18.720 --> 03:52:22.650
<v Speaker 1>1915,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the russians are losing 235,000</v>

3876
03:52:22.651 --> 03:52:27.651
<v Speaker 1>men every month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the end of 1915,</v>

3877
03:52:28.341 --> 03:52:33.341
<v Speaker 1>17 months into the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the total russian casualties are over 2 </v>

3878
03:52:33.341 --> 03:52:36.950
<v Speaker 1>million men and even though they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>replace the human beings,</v>

3879
03:52:37.430 --> 03:52:41.660
<v Speaker 1>what they can't do is replace the morale</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the people in the capital.</v>

3880
03:52:42.080 --> 03:52:45.860
<v Speaker 1>The czar tells his french and british </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterparts at the end of 1915 that the</v>

3881
03:52:45.861 --> 03:52:50.480
<v Speaker 1>population has turned pacifistic an anti</v>
<v Speaker 1>allied.</v>

3882
03:52:51.950 --> 03:52:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the western allies are having their own </v>

3883
03:52:56.950 --> 03:52:57.350
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The soldiers in the trenches starting to</v>

3884
03:52:57.351 --> 03:53:02.030
<v Speaker 1>get a little uppity about their </v>
<v Speaker 1>willingness to continue suicidal attacks</v>

3885
03:53:02.120 --> 03:53:07.120
<v Speaker 1>endlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good sign commander of the </v>

3886
03:53:07.120 --> 03:53:12.101
<v Speaker 1>german forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creating strategy is deciding that if </v>

3887
03:53:12.101 --> 03:53:15.701
<v Speaker 1>they're really in a war of attrition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not design the battles to kill the </v>

3888
03:53:15.701 --> 03:53:19.871
<v Speaker 1>most people instead of having </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakthroughs and maneuvers and all </v>

3889
03:53:19.871 --> 03:53:22.901
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and eric von falcon hine creates a </v>

3890
03:53:22.901 --> 03:53:26.831
<v Speaker 1>killing ground to invite the french </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation to bleed itself white in the big </v>

3891
03:53:28.281 --> 03:53:33.281
<v Speaker 1>fleets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally come out to play and new </v>

3892
03:53:33.281 --> 03:53:36.491
<v Speaker 1>technologies debut whose job it is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>break this log jam of trenches,</v>

3893
03:53:38.840 --> 03:53:43.310
<v Speaker 1>machine guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barbed wire and gas.</v>

3894
03:53:44.980 --> 03:53:48.940
<v Speaker 1>The year in 1916 is sometimes called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaker of nations.</v>

3895
03:53:49.610 --> 03:53:54.610
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be some nations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffer some mortal wounds before that </v>

3896
03:53:54.610 --> 03:53:56.350
<v Speaker 1>year is over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that and more.</v>

3897
03:53:57.040 --> 03:54:00.220
<v Speaker 1>In part four of blueprint for </v>
<v Speaker 1>armageddon.</v>
