<v Speaker 1>of a multipart series on the first world</v>

2
00:00:04.591 --> 00:00:05.850
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like,</v>

3
00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:10.110
<v Speaker 1>your stories to have some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cohesive linear narrative flow.</v>

4
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Although I'm not promising that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably couldn't deliver on that,</v>

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 1>but if that's what you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're probably better off suggesting you</v>

6
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 1>go check out episode number one and work</v>
<v Speaker 1>your way to hear.</v>

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.850
<v Speaker 1>If you don't care about that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff at all,</v>

8
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:25.851
<v Speaker 1>or you just don't trust me to deliver a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cohesive linear narrative flow and I </v>

9
00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:26.940
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't blame you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then by all means,</v>

10
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 1>start here at part four and check out </v>
<v Speaker 1>this series that we're calling blueprint</v>

11
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>for Armageddon.</v>

12
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 2>Be Bus seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.600
<v Speaker 2>41,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a date which will live in infamy.</v>

14
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.110
<v Speaker 1>It's history.</v>

15
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.740
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

16
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>The events</v>

17
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.310
<v Speaker 4>that dude figures from this time and </v>
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>

18
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 5>I take pride in the words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>been the Alina,</v>

19
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.220
<v Speaker 4>tear down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>complete collapse.</v>

20
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.120
<v Speaker 4>Welcome this kind of examination because</v>
<v Speaker 4>people have got to know whether or not </v>

21
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 4>the president said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

22
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:38.151
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a crop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we dig deep in our history and our </v>

23
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 4>doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember if we are not descended</v>

24
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.400
<v Speaker 4>from fearful of man,</v>

25
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.380
<v Speaker 1>it's hardcore history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you market war,</v>

26
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.700
<v Speaker 1>how do you sell combat to the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are actually going to have to engage in </v>

27
00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:05.560
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a hypothetical question,</v>

28
00:02:05.561 --> 00:02:10.561
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any military that requires volunteers to</v>

29
00:02:11.171 --> 00:02:15.940
<v Speaker 1>decide they want to join the service has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think about how you actually sell the</v>

30
00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:19.180
<v Speaker 1>idea to the people who you know have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take part in it.</v>

31
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>An idea that carries with it the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential for some very nasty outcomes </v>

32
00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:26.800
<v Speaker 1>in the very worst of circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

33
00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:30.850
<v Speaker 1>So difficult job perhaps to market </v>
<v Speaker 1>combat.</v>

34
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.610
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to do in peace time though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:37.510
<v Speaker 1>If you have to sell Suntan oil to people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Alaska,</v>

36
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.320
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to pull that off in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the summer in December.</v>

37
00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:45.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a really tough sell before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war breaks out.</v>

38
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.330
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying to market recruitment </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the British army,</v>

39
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.000
<v Speaker 1>you can sell the same sort of talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>points,</v>

40
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.010
<v Speaker 1>the same soda angles that have worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>for governments and monarchies and </v>

41
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.400
<v Speaker 1>tribes.</v>

42
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Going back to the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>

43
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>the military has long had certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling points.</v>

44
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.290
<v Speaker 1>I think we're all familiar with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could add regular pay thrown in to </v>

45
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The heroism,</v>

46
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>the adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the status.</v>

47
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people just like to fight.</v>

49
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never know.</v>

50
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.780
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that that's a pre </v>
<v Speaker 1>1914,</v>

51
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking point when it comes to what </v>

52
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.931
<v Speaker 1>happens when the first world war breaks </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and how that just totally messes </v>

53
00:03:30.931 --> 00:03:35.821
<v Speaker 1>with your marketing strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're marketing hell as a travel</v>

54
00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 1>destination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

55
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 1>no matter how much precedence or ship </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

56
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>and the British had plenty in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>world war,</v>

57
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:48.811
<v Speaker 1>just like everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't mask those kinds of casualty </v>

58
00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 1>number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can mask the reality,</v>

59
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:54.601
<v Speaker 1>the sort of stuff that some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper reporters who were censored </v>

60
00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:54.601
<v Speaker 1>during the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the war,</v>

61
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would write books,</v>

62
00:03:55.991 --> 00:04:00.991
<v Speaker 1>telling you the real story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what really happened because you </v>

63
00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:00.991
<v Speaker 1>couldn't have imagined it and it was all</v>
<v Speaker 1>censored by the press.</v>

64
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Even with the censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't hide the death and destruction</v>

65
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:10.741
<v Speaker 1>and dismemberment and you see the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>returning to your hometown with the </v>

66
00:04:10.741 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 1>horrible wounds and you hear some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rumors and stories,</v>

67
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.100
<v Speaker 1>you know it's not going to be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden the marketers in Great </v>

68
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Britain's recruitment operation have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play hard ball no more just throwing out</v>

69
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 1>carrots they're going to use some sticks</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

70
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.040
<v Speaker 1>In the US.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a 21st century volunteer army </v>

71
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.201
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and the US uses just carrots </v>
<v Speaker 1>to encourage people to join up.</v>

72
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.000
<v Speaker 1>We'll pay you more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll pay you for college.</v>

73
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.920
<v Speaker 1>You'll make something of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

74
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:44.050
<v Speaker 1>there's all these different things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to motivate people,</v>

75
00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:46.840
<v Speaker 1>but there's not very many sticks in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>US system.</v>

76
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Once the first couple of weeks of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war happened and everybody </v>

77
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 1>together finds out how enormous this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be an in an absolutely stunning</v>

78
00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:56.830
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

79
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Wake up call where the light goes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>over everyone's head and they're going,</v>

80
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.310
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have enough resources and oh my</v>

81
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:08.311
<v Speaker 1>gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have enough money for a war </v>

82
00:05:08.311 --> 00:05:08.311
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Oh my gosh,</v>

83
00:05:08.311 --> 00:05:11.071
<v Speaker 1>we don't have enough people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even some of these larger states </v>

84
00:05:11.071 --> 00:05:11.350
<v Speaker 1>where you think to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you know,</v>

85
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:13.750
<v Speaker 1>people shouldn't be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at how many people are coming up.</v>

86
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Every generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember manpower in the old,</v>

87
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>air quotes means manpower across the </v>

88
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.431
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just the people fighting on the </v>

89
00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:28.051
<v Speaker 1>front line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people that can still be minors </v>

90
00:05:28.051 --> 00:05:31.351
<v Speaker 1>to extract the material you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>carry on the war or people working in </v>

91
00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:36.240
<v Speaker 1>arms manufacturing plants so that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can build the bombs you need to fight </v>

92
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.490
<v Speaker 1>the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

93
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:39.490
<v Speaker 1>if you take too much to throw on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting line,</v>

94
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.940
<v Speaker 1>you won't have enough people back home </v>
<v Speaker 1>making the stuff that the people on the </v>

95
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.940
<v Speaker 1>fighting line need to win.</v>

96
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>power becomes a very big deal.</v>

97
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.240
<v Speaker 1>All these other countries in the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

98
00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:49.840
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>

99
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.850
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've spent decades working out a </v>

100
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.360
<v Speaker 1>conscription operation where they draft </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

101
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come of age,</v>

102
00:05:57.201 --> 00:06:02.201
<v Speaker 1>you do a couple of years in the service </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you become parts of the </v>

103
00:06:02.201 --> 00:06:04.781
<v Speaker 1>reserves and then you become parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other reserve and the heavier and </v>

104
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:07.601
<v Speaker 1>older reserve and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after a while they've got a whole </v>

105
00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 1>revolving self perpetuating system in </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

106
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Whereas every generation comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're cranking out new soldiers except</v>

107
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:17.411
<v Speaker 1>for Great Britain there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last volunteer service in involved </v>

108
00:06:18.321 --> 00:06:19.730
<v Speaker 1>in this conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it breaks out,</v>

109
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.760
<v Speaker 1>it puts unique pressures on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing they do is simply ask </v>

110
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:30.281
<v Speaker 1>people to join up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And remember in 1914 you didn't quite </v>

111
00:06:30.281 --> 00:06:33.041
<v Speaker 1>know what you were in for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could still sell the old selling </v>

112
00:06:33.041 --> 00:06:33.041
<v Speaker 1>points.</v>

113
00:06:33.041 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 1>The uniforms are wonderful and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

114
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 1>you'll look dashing and it just be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean war adventure killed the Bosch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:40.190
<v Speaker 1>all the good methods that king needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

117
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.250
<v Speaker 1>king and country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the things that have always worked </v>

118
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.250
<v Speaker 1>and still work by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of cases,</v>

119
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.170
<v Speaker 1>especially in peace time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

120
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.280
<v Speaker 1>worked in more folks in Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Scotland and Canada and Australia </v>

121
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.390
<v Speaker 1>and all these places signed up than they</v>
<v Speaker 1>even could handle.</v>

122
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 1>They were looking for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred thousand,</v>

123
00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.700
<v Speaker 1>got a lot more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's before the casualties start </v>

124
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.110
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of patriotic Britain signup,</v>

125
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.500
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know how many patriotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain's journey you're going to need </v>

126
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.740
<v Speaker 1>and not just in one big lump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every month to replace the troops.</v>

127
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:12.530
<v Speaker 1>You lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In late 1915,</v>

128
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:17.560
<v Speaker 1>the British just lose at Gullapalli and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they walk away after a couple of months </v>

129
00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 1>with 250,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties.</v>

130
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.650
<v Speaker 1>You don't just replace those by playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice and easy and saying,</v>

131
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:28.070
<v Speaker 1>come and fight for king and country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're using more hardball methods,</v>

132
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.670
<v Speaker 1>and one of the ones that I've always </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought was just indicative of something</v>

133
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:36.671
<v Speaker 1>that if you imagined it in modern times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it boggles the mind using a strategy </v>

134
00:07:36.671 --> 00:07:37.250
<v Speaker 1>like this today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's absolute genius.</v>

135
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:43.080
<v Speaker 1>It shows exactly the most vulnerable </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in a young man's psyche.</v>

136
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean the place where if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketer,</v>

137
00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:47.540
<v Speaker 1>you're looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you know,</v>

138
00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:49.760
<v Speaker 1>what motivates people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you can touch these,</v>

139
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:54.350
<v Speaker 1>these elements of influence in the order</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the feather.</v>

140
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:57.860
<v Speaker 1>The white feather movement is absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant in that regard.</v>

141
00:07:57.861 --> 00:07:58.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost devious.</v>

142
00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:03.851
<v Speaker 1>You try to imagine our government doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this today with modern </v>

143
00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:04.310
<v Speaker 1>21st century technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to think about,</v>

144
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.620
<v Speaker 1>but basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when August,</v>

145
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:07.520
<v Speaker 1>early September,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

146
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:12.521
<v Speaker 1>14 rolls around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an admiral in the British </v>

147
00:08:12.521 --> 00:08:15.071
<v Speaker 1>admiralty who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's working like everyone else to </v>

148
00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:15.071
<v Speaker 1>think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

149
00:08:15.071 --> 00:08:17.950
<v Speaker 1>how can we encourage more people to sign</v>
<v Speaker 1>up for this horrible war and comes up </v>

150
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:18.660
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

151
00:08:18.661 --> 00:08:21.650
<v Speaker 1>and an attack on a motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a marketing strategy.</v>

152
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:27.070
<v Speaker 1>He's going to enlist patriotic young </v>
<v Speaker 1>British women to walk the streets of all</v>

153
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:29.600
<v Speaker 1>these towns in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hometowns.</v>

154
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there are people they know and if </v>

155
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.341
<v Speaker 1>they see men not in uniform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who looked like they could be or should </v>

156
00:08:36.341 --> 00:08:37.760
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are going to go up,</v>

157
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.810
<v Speaker 1>surround this person and start saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most horrible thing.</v>

158
00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:44.480
<v Speaker 1>You are a coward and all these terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to them.</v>

159
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:50.290
<v Speaker 1>In know pretty women in public dressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>you down if you're 18 years old,</v>

160
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.780
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty good marketing chink in </v>
<v Speaker 1>arm or to exploit,</v>

161
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.640
<v Speaker 1>not just that you're probably in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually we're on the streets of your </v>

162
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.440
<v Speaker 1>hometown where the pastors by no you or </v>
<v Speaker 1>your family.</v>

163
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:08.250
<v Speaker 1>This is a profoundly embarrassing </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

164
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

165
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:11.550
<v Speaker 1>for everyone around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone connected with you.</v>

166
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.910
<v Speaker 1>God forbid if you have a girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's gonna think this looks pretty bad </v>

167
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.910
<v Speaker 1>for her too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

168
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:17.730
<v Speaker 1>the effect was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was huge.</v>

169
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 1>And then before this little group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

170
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're done with you.</v>

171
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:26.750
<v Speaker 1>They would put a white feather </v>
<v Speaker 1>signifying cowardice on your lapel or </v>

172
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:29.490
<v Speaker 1>somewhere very visible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

173
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 1>on you.</v>

174
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 1>This was not an unusual occurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are accounts for people that say </v>

175
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.611
<v Speaker 1>they were afraid to go outside the house</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes because these patriotic and </v>

176
00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:44.830
<v Speaker 1>zealous women who were really just </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to help.</v>

177
00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the funny part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the society motivating,</v>

178
00:09:47.171 --> 00:09:48.520
<v Speaker 1>patriotism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things,</v>

179
00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:48.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

180
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:54.040
<v Speaker 1>it's all the right virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've got an account from a 16 year </v>

181
00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:58.831
<v Speaker 1>old boy who had to go through this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then he signed up for the service </v>

182
00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:03.571
<v Speaker 1>because he was so deathly embarrassed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and afraid and an inch and ashamed and </v>

183
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:05.230
<v Speaker 1>the service person laughed him out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the room,</v>

184
00:10:05.231 --> 00:10:08.230
<v Speaker 1>but then said he looked so downtrodden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he exaggerated this height,</v>

185
00:10:08.231 --> 00:10:09.340
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does age,</v>

186
00:10:09.341 --> 00:10:14.341
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated his weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was in at 16 under 110 pounds on </v>

187
00:10:17.201 --> 00:10:22.030
<v Speaker 1>the western front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely deviously clever.</v>

188
00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to imagine us using it today.</v>

189
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas could backfire though.</v>

190
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.060
<v Speaker 1>These creative marketing recruitment </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

191
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:36.450
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government felt the need to put out </v>

192
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.851
<v Speaker 1>symbols that people could wear who had </v>
<v Speaker 1>already done their service overseas and </v>

193
00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:41.950
<v Speaker 1>had been wounded and honorably </v>
<v Speaker 1>discharged or who worked for some really</v>

194
00:10:41.951 --> 00:10:46.951
<v Speaker 1>important armaments or war related </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry and couldn't be spared because </v>

195
00:10:46.951 --> 00:10:50.851
<v Speaker 1>apparently enough of those people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>being mistakenly given the order of the </v>

196
00:10:50.851 --> 00:10:55.021
<v Speaker 1>white feather treatment to make that an </v>
<v Speaker 1>important thing for the government to </v>

197
00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:58.471
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were other creative marketing </v>

198
00:10:58.471 --> 00:10:58.690
<v Speaker 1>plans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not sticks but carrots and one of them,</v>

199
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.390
<v Speaker 1>another brilliant one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about it on the surface,</v>

200
00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.660
<v Speaker 1>involve the British government </v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining to recruits that if you sign </v>

201
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:06.660
<v Speaker 1>up with your pals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your buddies,</v>

202
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:11.590
<v Speaker 1>you could all serve together as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People joined up from the same street or</v>

203
00:11:11.591 --> 00:11:16.591
<v Speaker 1>the same pub or the same community or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same fraternity or the same </v>

204
00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:18.910
<v Speaker 1>profession and they all serve together </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had wonderful names.</v>

205
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.730
<v Speaker 1>These are like military unit names that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still known by.</v>

206
00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:26.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were the Liverpool pals or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the grimsby chums and these friends all </v>

207
00:11:27.491 --> 00:11:29.080
<v Speaker 1>went to the service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She figured if you've got to serve,</v>

208
00:11:29.081 --> 00:11:30.370
<v Speaker 1>you might as well do it with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

209
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.950
<v Speaker 1>but then you get to watch your friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

210
00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.220
<v Speaker 1>It's the part we didn't really consider </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we signed up and it sounded kind of</v>

211
00:11:36.221 --> 00:11:39.490
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just that when these units would get</v>

212
00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:41.410
<v Speaker 1>decimated in some of these terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounters.</v>

213
00:11:41.411 --> 00:11:43.720
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be walking down a road with your</v>

214
00:11:43.721 --> 00:11:47.890
<v Speaker 1>pals in the open and all of a sudden get</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught by our Taylor refire,</v>

215
00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:53.070
<v Speaker 1>suffer 80 percent casualties and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of the losses and the suffering </v>

216
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:58.260
<v Speaker 1>and the grief being spread out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of diluted across the width and </v>

217
00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.820
<v Speaker 1>breadth of the entire British isles or </v>
<v Speaker 1>British empire for that matter,</v>

218
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:06.210
<v Speaker 1>some local community or some fraternity </v>
<v Speaker 1>or some profession just gets pounded and</v>

219
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:12.991
<v Speaker 1>there are villages and towns in Britain </v>
<v Speaker 1>now that had these terrible days just </v>

220
00:12:12.991 --> 00:12:17.791
<v Speaker 1>happened to the whole community and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much everybody suffers a major </v>

221
00:12:17.791 --> 00:12:21.151
<v Speaker 1>loss one way or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if the downside of that clever </v>

222
00:12:21.151 --> 00:12:23.911
<v Speaker 1>marketing plan by 1916,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing clever enough to get </v>

223
00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:25.150
<v Speaker 1>enough people in uniform.</v>

224
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:30.010
<v Speaker 1>The losses are so high that the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally do what the British really don't</v>

225
00:12:30.011 --> 00:12:32.860
<v Speaker 1>do and they started conscripting their </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

226
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:37.930
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to blame the British for </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting the same sort of draft that the</v>

227
00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:40.870
<v Speaker 1>continental great powers use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do.</v>

228
00:12:40.871 --> 00:12:42.310
<v Speaker 1>As we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the casualties were so high.</v>

229
00:12:42.311 --> 00:12:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Look at the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the end of Nineteen 15,</v>

230
00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:46.030
<v Speaker 1>the British have suffered half a million</v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties,</v>

231
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.700
<v Speaker 1>200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those are dead by the way,</v>

232
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:54.180
<v Speaker 1>for a traditionally naval power who has </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditionally are rather small army by </v>

233
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.980
<v Speaker 1>continental standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are huge numbers.</v>

234
00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Now you want to see what continental </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards look like.</v>

235
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Look at the British ally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French who had a huge army in the </v>

236
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.960
<v Speaker 1>meat grinder since the first minute of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole affair,</v>

237
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:11.230
<v Speaker 1>and by the end of Nineteen 15 there </v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties are over 2 million.</v>

238
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:17.520
<v Speaker 1>More than 700,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those are dead and all these great </v>

239
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:22.471
<v Speaker 1>powers are looking at their principal </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemies and trying to figure out how </v>

240
00:13:22.471 --> 00:13:24.940
<v Speaker 1>close they are to the throwing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>towel moment.</v>

241
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.360
<v Speaker 1>The Germans are looking at the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the casualties they have </v>

242
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.611
<v Speaker 1>suffered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're looking in their </v>

243
00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:33.751
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They must be close to the end of their </v>

244
00:13:33.751 --> 00:13:36.601
<v Speaker 1>rope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Germans have suffered more </v>

245
00:13:36.601 --> 00:13:36.940
<v Speaker 1>casualties by the end of 1915,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the French,</v>

246
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:38.920
<v Speaker 1>but they're fighting on more fronts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

247
00:13:38.921 --> 00:13:40.480
<v Speaker 1>They're fighting the French and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British in the west,</v>

248
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:45.810
<v Speaker 1>the gigantic Russian forces in the east </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're involved in the Balkans a </v>

249
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:47.320
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1915 there,</v>

250
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:50.590
<v Speaker 1>casualties by the end of 1915 or over </v>
<v Speaker 1>two and a half million,</v>

251
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:55.450
<v Speaker 1>about 750,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those are dead hard to know.</v>

252
00:13:55.451 --> 00:14:00.040
<v Speaker 1>The Germans list 250,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>missing in this war.</v>

253
00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:04.690
<v Speaker 1>People got blown to bits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got covered up by a giant mountains</v>

254
00:14:04.691 --> 00:14:06.670
<v Speaker 1>of earth that Shell's had blown up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air,</v>

255
00:14:06.671 --> 00:14:09.670
<v Speaker 1>falling back on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of missing people probably between</v>

256
00:14:09.671 --> 00:14:14.671
<v Speaker 1>750 and 800,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead for the Germans at this point in </v>

257
00:14:14.671 --> 00:14:15.040
<v Speaker 1>the war.</v>

258
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:19.270
<v Speaker 1>The Russians have suffered titanic </v>
<v Speaker 1>losses from minute one.</v>

259
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.750
<v Speaker 1>They lost a huge battle in 1915 called </v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

260
00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Gorley's tarnoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're to least a ton off.</v>

261
00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:31.240
<v Speaker 1>And that battle all by itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lost 150,000</v>

262
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.940
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost 700,000</v>

263
00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:37.120
<v Speaker 1>wounded and basically a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>prisoners.</v>

264
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Those titanic losses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's easier to understand their </v>

265
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:48.030
<v Speaker 1>monthly burn rate by October 1915.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Russians are losing 235,000</v>

266
00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:52.550
<v Speaker 1>men a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How sustainable is that?</v>

267
00:14:52.551 --> 00:14:57.551
<v Speaker 1>You again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to be looking at the Russians </v>

268
00:14:57.551 --> 00:14:58.280
<v Speaker 1>thinking they're almost done and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>German high command kind of is now.</v>

269
00:14:58.281 --> 00:15:02.300
<v Speaker 1>The Germans can't be too happy though </v>
<v Speaker 1>because their main ally,</v>

270
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:07.690
<v Speaker 1>the Austrian Hungarians are suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties that are every bit as </v>

271
00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:10.430
<v Speaker 1>momentous as the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have the manpower to back</v>

272
00:15:10.431 --> 00:15:14.990
<v Speaker 1>that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in one four month period in 1915,</v>

273
00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:18.710
<v Speaker 1>one four month period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Austrian suffer 750,000</v>

274
00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:20.270
<v Speaker 1>casualties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

275
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:26.380
<v Speaker 1>That's in addition to the already </v>
<v Speaker 1>astounding casualties they took in the </v>

276
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.160
<v Speaker 1>few months right after the war started.</v>

277
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:33.460
<v Speaker 1>The Germans several times we'll have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prop up the Austrians just to keep them </v>

278
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.911
<v Speaker 1>able to continue in the conflict and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austrians are a pain in the rear to </v>

279
00:15:36.911 --> 00:15:41.741
<v Speaker 1>their German allies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the time mean for Eric on </v>

280
00:15:41.741 --> 00:15:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Falcon and the German commander in </v>
<v Speaker 1>charge in January of 1916.</v>

281
00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:47.921
<v Speaker 1>He can't stand them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are always getting into some sort </v>

282
00:15:47.921 --> 00:15:51.431
<v Speaker 1>of disaster that they then go to Falcon </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hein and ask for help getting out of and</v>

283
00:15:51.711 --> 00:15:54.740
<v Speaker 1>to make matters worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usually a disaster that fund falcon</v>

284
00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:57.170
<v Speaker 1>hind and warned them about in advance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that.</v>

285
00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:02.470
<v Speaker 1>It'll be a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they do it against his wishes </v>

286
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:03.260
<v Speaker 1>and then come and ask to be bailed out </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple times.</v>

287
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:06.560
<v Speaker 1>They can always play their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their trump card though,</v>

288
00:16:06.561 --> 00:16:07.820
<v Speaker 1>against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Falcon Hine,</v>

289
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.180
<v Speaker 1>legitimately considering the huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties they've suffered.</v>

290
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.860
<v Speaker 1>They can kind of go there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well listen,</v>

291
00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:13.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

292
00:16:13.401 --> 00:16:14.360
<v Speaker 1>if you don't help us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

293
00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:16.520
<v Speaker 1>we're not that far from dropping out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the war.</v>

294
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:21.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't guarantee you will be here and </v>

295
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:21.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to help them.</v>

296
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Or it's a strategic disaster if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Austro-hungarian dropout of the war.</v>

297
00:16:23.481 --> 00:16:28.481
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fun Falcon Hind doesn't want to pay </v>

298
00:16:28.481 --> 00:16:28.610
<v Speaker 1>any attention to any of these other </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

299
00:16:28.611 --> 00:16:30.110
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want to worry about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians.</v>

300
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:33.170
<v Speaker 1>There are German generals and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They keep saying,</v>

301
00:16:33.171 --> 00:16:35.240
<v Speaker 1>we need to focus on the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we win the war.</v>

302
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Falcon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to hear about that,</v>

303
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:42.260
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to focus in the Balkans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although in 1915 they destroy Serbia,</v>

304
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.400
<v Speaker 1>just get that out of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall behind,</v>

305
00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:48.020
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to hear about the Middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>East and the Turkey doesn't want to talk</v>

306
00:16:48.021 --> 00:16:50.840
<v Speaker 1>about Australia and her problem doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to know what he's doing.</v>

307
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:55.900
<v Speaker 1>He wants to focus on this maybe war </v>
<v Speaker 1>winning or war,</v>

308
00:16:56.421 --> 00:17:01.421
<v Speaker 1>losing Gordian Knot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the puzzle that must be solved </v>

309
00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:03.050
<v Speaker 1>if you are a general task with winning </v>
<v Speaker 1>this war.</v>

310
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:08.470
<v Speaker 1>It's the western front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you deal with that and it and </v>

311
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:12.371
<v Speaker 1>it's an unprecedented problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know there's a famous German saying </v>

312
00:17:12.371 --> 00:17:16.211
<v Speaker 1>that may or may not have happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's infused this whole period where</v>

313
00:17:17.031 --> 00:17:22.031
<v Speaker 1>one German general is supposed to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>commented about how amazingly the </v>

314
00:17:22.031 --> 00:17:26.051
<v Speaker 1>British troops fought and he said </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're lions and the sub commander with</v>

315
00:17:26.871 --> 00:17:29.960
<v Speaker 1>him is supposed to have said something </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the effect of Yes,</v>

316
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:32.150
<v Speaker 1>lucky for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are led by donkeys.</v>

317
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 15 is western front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Battles are where the donkeys first get </v>

318
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.830
<v Speaker 1>labeled with that sort of reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

319
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:47.840
<v Speaker 1>when you realize that they have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>metrics for what they're doing in 1915,</v>

320
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:51.990
<v Speaker 1>this has never been done before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's ever had this kind of firepower</v>

321
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.940
<v Speaker 1>and nobody's ever put these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>defenses up.</v>

322
00:17:53.941 --> 00:17:58.941
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're playing with all sorts of new </v>

323
00:17:58.941 --> 00:17:58.941
<v Speaker 1>military toys and they've never been </v>
<v Speaker 1>tested.</v>

324
00:17:58.941 --> 00:18:03.560
<v Speaker 1>In a situation like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much slack do you cut the generals </v>

325
00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.570
<v Speaker 1>and give them what is sometimes called </v>
<v Speaker 1>by historians,</v>

326
00:18:06.571 --> 00:18:11.571
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a learning curve when you're playing </v>

327
00:18:11.571 --> 00:18:14.991
<v Speaker 1>with people's lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how slowly are you allowed to figure </v>

328
00:18:14.991 --> 00:18:18.291
<v Speaker 1>things out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't go into any of the 1915 </v>

329
00:18:18.291 --> 00:18:22.131
<v Speaker 1>battles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Winston Churchill is just one of many </v>

330
00:18:22.131 --> 00:18:23.670
<v Speaker 1>people who object to the whole idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>calling those battles.</v>

331
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.700
<v Speaker 1>In the 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 year or 1916 year or 1917 year </v>

332
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:33.471
<v Speaker 1>battles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says it's a disservice to what the </v>

333
00:18:33.471 --> 00:18:36.531
<v Speaker 1>name means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said there were battles in 1914 at </v>

334
00:18:36.531 --> 00:18:37.320
<v Speaker 1>the start of the war and there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>battles in 1918 at the end of the war,</v>

335
00:18:37.321 --> 00:18:39.700
<v Speaker 1>but that stuff in the middle was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>siege.</v>

336
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.010
<v Speaker 1>He writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

337
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:47.030
<v Speaker 1>these sanguinary prodigious struggles </v>
<v Speaker 1>extending over many months are often </v>

338
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:51.891
<v Speaker 1>loosely described as battles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>judging by the number of men who took </v>

339
00:18:51.891 --> 00:18:56.181
<v Speaker 1>their turn in the fighting at different </v>
<v Speaker 1>times by the immense quantities of guns </v>

340
00:18:56.181 --> 00:18:58.770
<v Speaker 1>and shells employed and by the hideous </v>
<v Speaker 1>casualty totals.</v>

341
00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:04.040
<v Speaker 1>They certainly rank taken as a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>among the largest events in military </v>

342
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.511
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we must not be misled by </v>

343
00:19:08.511 --> 00:19:08.511
<v Speaker 1>terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to call them.</v>

344
00:19:08.511 --> 00:19:13.371
<v Speaker 1>Battles was merely a method of </v>
<v Speaker 1>presenting a general view of an </v>

345
00:19:13.371 --> 00:19:16.080
<v Speaker 1>otherwise confusing picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might well pass unchallenged,</v>

346
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:21.350
<v Speaker 1>but an attempt has been made by military</v>
<v Speaker 1>commanders and buy a whole school of </v>

347
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:25.521
<v Speaker 1>writers to represent these prolonged </v>
<v Speaker 1>operations as events comparable to the </v>

348
00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:31.431
<v Speaker 1>decisive battles of the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only larger and more important to yield </v>

349
00:19:31.431 --> 00:19:35.460
<v Speaker 1>to this specious argument is to be drawn</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a wholly wrong impression,</v>

350
00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:40.610
<v Speaker 1>both of military science and of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually took place in the Great War and</v>

351
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:45.950
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these battles on the western front for a</v>

352
00:19:46.411 --> 00:19:51.411
<v Speaker 1>full three years in the conflict look </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much like this as described by </v>

353
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.120
<v Speaker 1>historian older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her vague quote,</v>

354
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.940
<v Speaker 1>the fighting on the western front had </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken on a deadly regularity.</v>

355
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Attackers stormed enemy trenches in </v>
<v Speaker 1>waves only to be mowed down by hostile </v>

356
00:20:05.521 --> 00:20:09.180
<v Speaker 1>machine gun firing artillery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they tried to cut the wire,</v>

357
00:20:09.181 --> 00:20:12.690
<v Speaker 1>entanglements that protected the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earthworks and quote,</v>

358
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.580
<v Speaker 1>there's a repetitiveness to the fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the western front.</v>

359
00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:22.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a repetitiveness that actually is </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with World War One and the </v>

360
00:20:22.891 --> 00:20:25.770
<v Speaker 1>western front specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the tragedy.</v>

361
00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:31.010
<v Speaker 1>It adds to the pain because after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've seen this same event over and </v>

362
00:20:32.701 --> 00:20:37.701
<v Speaker 1>over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it become a different kind of </v>

363
00:20:37.701 --> 00:20:41.901
<v Speaker 1>tragic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you watch the first wave of those </v>

364
00:20:41.901 --> 00:20:43.140
<v Speaker 1>young soldiers leave the safety of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>trench,</v>

365
00:20:43.141 --> 00:20:46.470
<v Speaker 1>go over the top at the whistle of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>officer,</v>

366
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:51.250
<v Speaker 1>get down by machine gunfire before </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've even gone 10 feet.</v>

367
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.310
<v Speaker 1>That's tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's another level of tragedy.</v>

368
00:20:54.311 --> 00:20:58.480
<v Speaker 1>When the next wave gets up right behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to follow in their footsteps.</v>

369
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Having already seen what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

370
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:08.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what we wanted to capture in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions of the western front because</v>

371
00:21:08.941 --> 00:21:13.941
<v Speaker 1>it became an issue early on how we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to deal with all these battles </v>

372
00:21:13.941 --> 00:21:18.261
<v Speaker 1>that were roughly the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equally tragic and for the soldiers on </v>

373
00:21:18.261 --> 00:21:21.930
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eerily similar when trying to figure out</v>

374
00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.630
<v Speaker 1>what we wanted to highlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A shakespeare quote kept popping into my</v>

375
00:21:27.631 --> 00:21:32.631
<v Speaker 1>head when I was working on this and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was his line that all the world's a </v>

376
00:21:32.631 --> 00:21:36.090
<v Speaker 1>stage and all the people merely players </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought to myself,</v>

377
00:21:36.091 --> 00:21:37.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we have here.</v>

378
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:43.280
<v Speaker 1>We have one of the most extreme stages </v>
<v Speaker 1>in human history we've created with </v>

379
00:21:47.131 --> 00:21:49.560
<v Speaker 1>these western front battles in 1915,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

380
00:21:49.561 --> 00:21:50.640
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1917,</v>

381
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:55.910
<v Speaker 1>a hell like environment and then we </v>
<v Speaker 1>force millions of people to act in it,</v>

382
00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:06.710
<v Speaker 1>but some of the most extreme situations </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have been put into ever in </v>

383
00:22:06.781 --> 00:22:11.781
<v Speaker 1>history and watching how they endured is</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes soul crushing.</v>

384
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.300
<v Speaker 1>But at other times it's absolutely life </v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancing.</v>

385
00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:24.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you can benefit quite a bit </v>

386
00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:25.890
<v Speaker 1>from the suffering of other people.</v>

387
00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:34.260
<v Speaker 1>As we sat down when we started this </v>
<v Speaker 1>series and tried to figure out a </v>

388
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.310
<v Speaker 1>creative approach to dealing with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these battles,</v>

389
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:41.730
<v Speaker 1>one thing becomes very clear and we did </v>
<v Speaker 1>some creative experiments and you </v>

390
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:46.501
<v Speaker 1>quickly find out that the battles in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional sense reach a point of </v>

391
00:22:46.721 --> 00:22:51.721
<v Speaker 1>diminishing returns very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just become been benumbed by them </v>

392
00:22:52.091 --> 00:22:53.860
<v Speaker 1>all the scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intensity,</v>

393
00:22:53.861 --> 00:22:58.861
<v Speaker 1>the sheer horrific repetitive pounding </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually makes you stop feeling.</v>

394
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:06.360
<v Speaker 1>And so rather than go from I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>indecisive and horrific battle to the </v>

395
00:23:07.271 --> 00:23:11.980
<v Speaker 1>next indecisive and horrific battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we thought we would focus on a few,</v>

396
00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.550
<v Speaker 1>what we would consider to be almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>signature battles,</v>

397
00:23:15.551 --> 00:23:18.880
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they provide a very similar backdrop</v>

398
00:23:18.881 --> 00:23:23.620
<v Speaker 1>for the poor individuals who have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in that environment and allow us to</v>

399
00:23:23.621 --> 00:23:28.621
<v Speaker 1>sort of examined at a human level what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on here a little bit as best we </v>

400
00:23:28.621 --> 00:23:33.091
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to explore some of the questions </v>

401
00:23:33.091 --> 00:23:36.061
<v Speaker 1>that are very intriguing about the story</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not just about the human suffering </v>

402
00:23:36.061 --> 00:23:37.690
<v Speaker 1>that about command decisions and some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technology and some other things.</v>

403
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully interspersed with a little bit</v>

404
00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:43.870
<v Speaker 1>of comment about what's going on in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the world.</v>

405
00:23:43.871 --> 00:23:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Wild this is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of what makes 1916 so difficult</v>

406
00:23:47.901 --> 00:23:50.090
<v Speaker 1>is there's a lot of overlapping stuff.</v>

407
00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:55.060
<v Speaker 1>So if you tell it in a he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said then he said fashion.</v>

408
00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:00.360
<v Speaker 1>It becomes very confusing very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing to understand though is </v>

409
00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.921
<v Speaker 1>that 1916 comes about obviously because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of plans made in late 1915.</v>

410
00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:11.760
<v Speaker 1>We'd said to you earlier that this was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real question for the generals about how</v>

411
00:24:11.831 --> 00:24:15.730
<v Speaker 1>you solve this Gordian knot that is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>western front will.</v>

412
00:24:15.731 --> 00:24:20.731
<v Speaker 1>In late 1915,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the allied command's got together at a </v>

413
00:24:20.731 --> 00:24:22.420
<v Speaker 1>place called chantilly and France to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with this question.</v>

414
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:27.840
<v Speaker 1>They're plan was going to be to continue</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pound and pound harder,</v>

415
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:33.640
<v Speaker 1>but the new aspect was they were going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that everybody,</v>

416
00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:37.690
<v Speaker 1>all the different allied powers pounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>the central powers,</v>

417
00:24:37.691 --> 00:24:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Germany and friends at the same time,</v>

418
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.630
<v Speaker 1>they were going to coordinate their </v>
<v Speaker 1>efforts.</v>

419
00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:46.920
<v Speaker 1>This was going to nullify what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans had been doing.</v>

420
00:24:46.921 --> 00:24:48.630
<v Speaker 1>So far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Germans have a great army,</v>

421
00:24:48.631 --> 00:24:53.400
<v Speaker 1>but they can't be everywhere at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luckily for them up until 1916,</v>

422
00:24:53.401 --> 00:24:55.440
<v Speaker 1>they weren't attacked everywhere at </v>
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>

423
00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.890
<v Speaker 1>so they would use something called </v>
<v Speaker 1>interior lines.</v>

424
00:24:58.891 --> 00:25:02.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a little like taking the center </v>
<v Speaker 1>square in a game of tic TAC toe.</v>

425
00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:08.180
<v Speaker 1>The Germans were able to use their </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful railway system to transfer </v>

426
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:12.081
<v Speaker 1>troops from less threatened sectors to </v>
<v Speaker 1>more hotspots and thereby frustrate </v>

427
00:25:12.081 --> 00:25:17.031
<v Speaker 1>allied efforts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the allied plan for knocking down </v>

428
00:25:17.031 --> 00:25:18.390
<v Speaker 1>German fortifications in 1916 is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all going to attack it basically</v>

429
00:25:18.391 --> 00:25:23.391
<v Speaker 1>the same time frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Germans ability to move troops to </v>

430
00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:26.541
<v Speaker 1>hotspots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Germans had a different plan </v>

431
00:25:26.541 --> 00:25:28.911
<v Speaker 1>entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the people at chantilly in 1950 </v>

432
00:25:28.911 --> 00:25:32.721
<v Speaker 1>new get together and decide to attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans from multiple locations at </v>

433
00:25:32.721 --> 00:25:36.291
<v Speaker 1>the same time are still for the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>part in visioning the classic military </v>

434
00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:41.540
<v Speaker 1>end to this war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see the chances increased by </v>

435
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:46.461
<v Speaker 1>attacking at multiple locations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to crack the Germans </v>

436
00:25:46.461 --> 00:25:47.820
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and when you crack them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to send your forces through</v>

437
00:25:47.821 --> 00:25:52.821
<v Speaker 1>the breach and you're going to send the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cavalry through and now the Germans are </v>

438
00:25:52.821 --> 00:25:55.581
<v Speaker 1>going to break in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be on the run and they </v>

439
00:25:55.581 --> 00:25:57.081
<v Speaker 1>got to be routed towards Berlin and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that's how these things and in the </v>

440
00:25:57.081 --> 00:26:00.171
<v Speaker 1>minds of people who have a very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially in old fashioned view of war,</v>

441
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:04.650
<v Speaker 1>there are dissidence to this idea who </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

442
00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.990
<v Speaker 1>even on the allied side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got it all wrong.</v>

443
00:26:06.991 --> 00:26:09.060
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to happen that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The technology,</v>

444
00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.910
<v Speaker 1>the specific circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there are no flying on the</v>

445
00:26:11.911 --> 00:26:16.911
<v Speaker 1>western front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were dreaming and because you're </v>

446
00:26:16.911 --> 00:26:16.911
<v Speaker 1>dreaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your plans aren't going to work.</v>

447
00:26:16.911 --> 00:26:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the German side,</v>

448
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:23.470
<v Speaker 1>the people who have this attitude that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that old fashioned viewpoint is just </v>

449
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:27.701
<v Speaker 1>that old fashioned happened to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions of higher authority than the </v>

450
00:26:27.701 --> 00:26:28.940
<v Speaker 1>dissident generals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other side.</v>

451
00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:36.240
<v Speaker 1>They've looked at the way the war is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going and figured out that the </v>

452
00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.361
<v Speaker 1>casualties are the difference maker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all these countries are </v>

453
00:26:39.461 --> 00:26:41.650
<v Speaker 1>suffering because of the numbers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are dying.</v>

454
00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.520
<v Speaker 1>You need to increase the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who were dying,</v>

455
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.620
<v Speaker 1>not only does it become hard to replace </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

456
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:51.920
<v Speaker 1>but it puts huge stresses and strains on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the societies that are losing these </v>

457
00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.320
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their families,</v>

458
00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:57.321
<v Speaker 1>their governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of these societies are fragile </v>

459
00:26:57.321 --> 00:26:59.250
<v Speaker 1>enough to simply fall apart like a house</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cards.</v>

460
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Others could have the entire population </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned on the government and say,</v>

461
00:27:03.211 --> 00:27:08.211
<v Speaker 1>we know we've had enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That becomes the best path to end the </v>

462
00:27:08.211 --> 00:27:08.760
<v Speaker 1>war in the minds of some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>generals.</v>

463
00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:14.390
<v Speaker 1>A guy like the leader in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric von Falcon Hine is looking at what </v>

464
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:18.981
<v Speaker 1>these 1915 battles taught him and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>taught him that modern warfare on the </v>

465
00:27:19.441 --> 00:27:22.500
<v Speaker 1>western front turns into a meat grinder.</v>

466
00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:26.280
<v Speaker 1>No matter what you do when he comes up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the brilliant idea.</v>

467
00:27:26.281 --> 00:27:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most historians still think,</v>

468
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:29.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people say it's,</v>

469
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting an Arrow and painting a </v>

470
00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.141
<v Speaker 1>bullseye around it afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he comes up with the brilliant idea </v>

471
00:27:36.141 --> 00:27:38.811
<v Speaker 1>that these meat grinders are happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you designed the battle </v>

472
00:27:38.811 --> 00:27:42.381
<v Speaker 1>to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you designed the battle to be </v>

473
00:27:42.381 --> 00:27:44.181
<v Speaker 1>like a meat grinder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you create a meat grinder and </v>

474
00:27:44.181 --> 00:27:49.011
<v Speaker 1>then entice the enemy to come into it if</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's so effective on the </v>

475
00:27:49.011 --> 00:27:52.941
<v Speaker 1>battlefield?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you planned to grind meat </v>

476
00:27:52.941 --> 00:27:55.830
<v Speaker 1>instead of having it be a byproduct of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other activities and plans?</v>

477
00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.120
<v Speaker 1>And Falcon 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late 1915 determines that the French are</v>

478
00:28:00.121 --> 00:28:01.110
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

479
00:28:01.111 --> 00:28:06.111
<v Speaker 1>near their breaking point in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the casualties they've suffered and he </v>

480
00:28:06.111 --> 00:28:06.270
<v Speaker 1>goes to the rest of the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>command.</v>

481
00:28:06.271 --> 00:28:10.290
<v Speaker 1>He starts talking about what he'd like </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do in 1916 to try to win the war.</v>

482
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.600
<v Speaker 1>He wants to set a trap for the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>army.</v>

483
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
<v Speaker 1>The idea is to create one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

484
00:28:22.001 --> 00:28:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Modern Twentieth Century Attrition </v>
<v Speaker 1>Amplifiers,</v>

485
00:28:25.901 --> 00:28:30.190
<v Speaker 1>one of these meat grinders and then Lou </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the French army into it.</v>

486
00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:33.040
<v Speaker 1>For that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need bait</v>

487
00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:38.970
<v Speaker 1>and the determination on where this </v>
<v Speaker 1>awful battles going to happen is </v>

488
00:28:39.101 --> 00:28:44.101
<v Speaker 1>dependent on what site can be chosen </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would best play the role of Bait,</v>

489
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:50.070
<v Speaker 1>and I should point out that historians </v>
<v Speaker 1>from different countries disagree on </v>

490
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:52.891
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans and British historians often </v>

491
00:28:52.891 --> 00:28:54.280
<v Speaker 1>point out that this site chosen has no </v>
<v Speaker 1>real military value at all,</v>

492
00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:59.490
<v Speaker 1>that it was solely chosen because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the perfect emotional bait to lure the </v>

493
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:02.710
<v Speaker 1>French army into the meat grinder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>German and French historians,</v>

494
00:29:02.711 --> 00:29:07.711
<v Speaker 1>though often assert that this site did </v>
<v Speaker 1>have military importance and that that </v>

495
00:29:07.711 --> 00:29:12.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did create a real military need to do </v>

496
00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:12.490
<v Speaker 1>what the French ended up doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

497
00:29:12.491 --> 00:29:17.491
<v Speaker 1>the German plan is to use all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>artillery first to pulverize the </v>

498
00:29:17.741 --> 00:29:22.741
<v Speaker 1>defenses around this important site that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French have an emotional and </v>

499
00:29:22.741 --> 00:29:26.770
<v Speaker 1>political and everything else attachment</v>
<v Speaker 1>to below the French,</v>

500
00:29:26.771 --> 00:29:29.860
<v Speaker 1>off of these hills that overlooked this </v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

501
00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.310
<v Speaker 1>This city called Verdun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then four to five the hills.</v>

502
00:29:34.311 --> 00:29:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Bring your guns up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start shooting at the city of Verdun and</v>

503
00:29:38.631 --> 00:29:42.760
<v Speaker 1>wait for the French army to show up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>try knock you off those hills.</v>

504
00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:46.900
<v Speaker 1>And knowing the superiority of prepared </v>
<v Speaker 1>defenses,</v>

505
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:51.310
<v Speaker 1>the French are just going to bash </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves up against your barbed wire,</v>

506
00:29:51.311 --> 00:29:52.870
<v Speaker 1>your trenches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your machine guns,</v>

507
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:58.140
<v Speaker 1>your cannon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything else in a place that was </v>

508
00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:58.140
<v Speaker 1>specifically designed to be a killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>

509
00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:03.380
<v Speaker 1>So thoroughly attritional bloody 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

510
00:30:03.381 --> 00:30:07.450
<v Speaker 1>way to conduct warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a bad idea.</v>

511
00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:13.620
<v Speaker 1>It also should be no surprise that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle that was designed to act like a </v>

512
00:30:14.291 --> 00:30:19.000
<v Speaker 1>meat grinder turns into one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible battles of all time.</v>

513
00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Even the name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I hear it Verdun,</v>

514
00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.280
<v Speaker 1>it's like Stalin Grad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

515
00:30:27.281 --> 00:30:31.450
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those names that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>conjures up a specific image and,</v>

516
00:30:31.451 --> 00:30:36.451
<v Speaker 1>and level of horror that puts it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>special place in military history.</v>

517
00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:37.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

518
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:39.700
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like if you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

519
00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:42.880
<v Speaker 1>where's the worst place in the world to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever be in military history?</v>

520
00:30:42.881 --> 00:30:45.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like a tie between a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>different spots,</v>

521
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:48.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mankind's had a long enough past so that</v>

522
00:30:48.251 --> 00:30:53.050
<v Speaker 1>there are recurring examples of horrific</v>
<v Speaker 1>places to end up on any given day.</v>

523
00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:58.051
<v Speaker 1>We like to cite the famous battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the Romans and the </v>

524
00:30:58.051 --> 00:30:58.051
<v Speaker 1>Carthaginians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of years ago,</v>

525
00:30:58.051 --> 00:31:03.051
<v Speaker 1>Kenny were all those Romans were </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded and trapped and killed over </v>

526
00:31:03.051 --> 00:31:03.051
<v Speaker 1>the whole long day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

527
00:31:03.051 --> 00:31:07.701
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but probably about as bad as a lot of </v>

528
00:31:07.701 --> 00:31:09.600
<v Speaker 1>other terrible situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a few where you just go,</v>

529
00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:12.690
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's as bad as the battle of Kony sort</v>

530
00:31:12.691 --> 00:31:14.680
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But add artillery.</v>

531
00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:16.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean Verdun is like nothing</v>

532
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.530
<v Speaker 1>that has ever happened really on a large</v>
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>

533
00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

534
00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.850
<v Speaker 1>mankind's long history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's Kinda tried.</v>

535
00:31:22.851 --> 00:31:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Nothing's new under the sun as they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for dentists,</v>

536
00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Special Verdun is so special,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

537
00:31:27.891 --> 00:31:32.540
<v Speaker 1>and so different and so outside the box </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the thinking of the time period that</v>

538
00:31:32.541 --> 00:31:37.541
<v Speaker 1>when fall heightened comes up with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that he's going to bleed France </v>

539
00:31:37.541 --> 00:31:42.400
<v Speaker 1>white his words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so runs against the grain of the </v>

540
00:31:42.951 --> 00:31:45.770
<v Speaker 1>19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of morality of warfare.</v>

541
00:31:45.771 --> 00:31:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Remember we started this war a mere year</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half ago wearing white gloves with</v>

542
00:31:50.631 --> 00:31:55.631
<v Speaker 1>people who dewald when they were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>school together and who thought of this </v>

543
00:31:55.631 --> 00:31:56.300
<v Speaker 1>in an almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially on the western front,</v>

544
00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Golan kind of sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

545
00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:00.980
<v Speaker 1>We should exchange swords when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrender and all this stuff,</v>

546
00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:02.930
<v Speaker 1>and now we have generals thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

547
00:32:02.931 --> 00:32:07.931
<v Speaker 1>how can I lewer millions of men into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>confined space and just pound them into </v>

548
00:32:09.291 --> 00:32:14.291
<v Speaker 1>Marmalade to quote one French soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of explaining what happened.</v>

549
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:18.170
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I love by the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this period,</v>

550
00:32:18.171 --> 00:32:20.030
<v Speaker 1>just like I love it about the Second </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War,</v>

551
00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:24.740
<v Speaker 1>is that we have a lot of the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>words of the generals themselves.</v>

552
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.350
<v Speaker 1>They all wrote memoirs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said after the war,</v>

553
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:31.610
<v Speaker 1>most of the time trying to defend their </v>
<v Speaker 1>reputation against their critics because</v>

554
00:32:31.611 --> 00:32:36.611
<v Speaker 1>after this war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's pointing fingers at </v>

555
00:32:36.611 --> 00:32:36.611
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

556
00:32:36.611 --> 00:32:40.241
<v Speaker 1>because it was so terrible and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>were so angry and so mad generals </v>

557
00:32:40.241 --> 00:32:42.380
<v Speaker 1>amongst other people that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking to blame.</v>

558
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Then all these generals would write </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces defending their ideas.</v>

559
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.140
<v Speaker 1>We have faulconer Heinz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have looted and doors.</v>

560
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:51.640
<v Speaker 1>We have all these guy's memoir's now you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't take them at face value.</v>

561
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to stake out a historical</v>

562
00:32:54.381 --> 00:32:58.100
<v Speaker 1>position here in defense of their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical reputation.</v>

563
00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Falcon Nine,</v>

564
00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:04.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you either love fall behind or hate </v>

565
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:04.760
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

566
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:04.760
<v Speaker 1>He has his fans and he has his </v>
<v Speaker 1>detractors.</v>

567
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of his fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the way his mind works and the </v>

568
00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:08.620
<v Speaker 1>way he writes in his book where he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

569
00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.210
<v Speaker 1>written right after the war where he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to explain his thinking on this.</v>

570
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.460
<v Speaker 1>He runs down in logical fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

571
00:33:13.461 --> 00:33:17.810
<v Speaker 1>where he sees the war in 1915 and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not that bad for the central powers.</v>

572
00:33:17.811 --> 00:33:22.811
<v Speaker 1>You'll hear a lot of people that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>say after the Germans failed with that </v>

573
00:33:22.811 --> 00:33:25.751
<v Speaker 1>initial knockout blow in 1914,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all a hard slog downhill for </v>

574
00:33:25.751 --> 00:33:26.030
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Necessarily</v>

575
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 15 was a good year for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>central powers.</v>

576
00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:35.570
<v Speaker 1>They'll have some other attempts where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll almost win the war later in the </v>

577
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.570
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is like,</v>

578
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:36.390
<v Speaker 1>as we've said all along the heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

579
00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.690
<v Speaker 1>and there are times when both sides have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other side in trouble.</v>

580
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:43.500
<v Speaker 1>A quick look at Fall Ghanaians Memoir </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows that he thinks Francis in trouble,</v>

581
00:33:43.501 --> 00:33:45.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that far from the breaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

582
00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:50.810
<v Speaker 1>Here's what Falcon Hind writes about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his thinking leading up to his planning </v>

583
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:52.830
<v Speaker 1>for this battle that he's most known for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it for done.</v>

584
00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:55.010
<v Speaker 1>Falcon hine writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

585
00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:01.460
<v Speaker 1>as I've already insisted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strain on France has almost reached </v>

586
00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:05.001
<v Speaker 1>the breaking point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though it is certainly borne with the </v>

587
00:34:05.001 --> 00:34:07.491
<v Speaker 1>most remarkable devotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we succeeded in opening the eyes of </v>

588
00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:09.870
<v Speaker 1>her people to the fact that in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>military sense they have nothing more to</v>

589
00:34:09.871 --> 00:34:12.990
<v Speaker 1>hope for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That breaking point would be reached and</v>

590
00:34:12.991 --> 00:34:17.040
<v Speaker 1>England's best sword knocked out of her </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand to achieve that object.</v>

591
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:22.190
<v Speaker 1>The uncertain method of a massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakthrough in any case beyond our </v>

592
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:25.971
<v Speaker 1>means is unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can probably do enough for our </v>

593
00:34:25.971 --> 00:34:29.661
<v Speaker 1>purposes with limited resources within </v>
<v Speaker 1>our reach behind the French sector of </v>

594
00:34:29.661 --> 00:34:34.401
<v Speaker 1>the western front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are our objectives for the </v>

595
00:34:34.401 --> 00:34:37.071
<v Speaker 1>retention of which the French general </v>
<v Speaker 1>staff would be compelled to throw in </v>

596
00:34:37.071 --> 00:34:38.610
<v Speaker 1>every man they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they do so,</v>

597
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:43.880
<v Speaker 1>the forces of France will bleed to death</v>
<v Speaker 1>as there can be no question of a </v>

598
00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.140
<v Speaker 1>voluntary withdrawal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether we reach our goal or not.</v>

599
00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.520
<v Speaker 1>And to quote</v>

600
00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:52.740
<v Speaker 1>British military historian John Keegan </v>
<v Speaker 1>put it this way,</v>

601
00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:56.700
<v Speaker 1>quote Falcon Heinz plan was brutally </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple.</v>

602
00:34:56.970 --> 00:35:01.970
<v Speaker 1>The French forced to fight in a crucial </v>
<v Speaker 1>but narrowly constricted corner of the </v>

603
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:06.441
<v Speaker 1>western front would be compelled to feed</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforcements into a battle of </v>

604
00:35:06.441 --> 00:35:09.840
<v Speaker 1>attrition where the material </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances so favored the Germans.</v>

605
00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:13.290
<v Speaker 1>That defeat was inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the French gave up the struggle,</v>

606
00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.840
<v Speaker 1>they would lose verdun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they persisted,</v>

607
00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:21.080
<v Speaker 1>they would lose their army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to quote this plan of Falcon Heine </v>

608
00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:25.260
<v Speaker 1>was given the sinister sounding name of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Operation Gallery,</v>

609
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.170
<v Speaker 1>which I've seen translated multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways.</v>

610
00:35:28.171 --> 00:35:33.171
<v Speaker 1>Usually it's called operation judgment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which implies a sort of finality that is</v>

611
00:35:34.501 --> 00:35:37.140
<v Speaker 1>the high hope of fall behind going into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this campaign.</v>

612
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this will decide the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another translation you sometimes run </v>

613
00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:45.500
<v Speaker 1>into his court of Justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same sort of an idea,</v>

614
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:49.110
<v Speaker 1>a decision point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third translation though that you'll</v>

615
00:35:49.111 --> 00:35:54.111
<v Speaker 1>sometimes run into is more indicative of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tactics and approach that Falcon </v>

616
00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Heights going to take to win this </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle.</v>

617
00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:02.690
<v Speaker 1>It's operation place of execution and </v>
<v Speaker 1>while the Kaiser and fall behind and all</v>

618
00:36:05.161 --> 00:36:07.470
<v Speaker 1>these generals are coming up with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan in late 1915,</v>

619
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:12.510
<v Speaker 1>the allies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entente forces are doing the same </v>

620
00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.310
<v Speaker 1>thing and the allies a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>lackadaisical about the whole thing.</v>

621
00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:19.311
<v Speaker 1>Not the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the people in the Balkans had been </v>

622
00:36:19.311 --> 00:36:19.380
<v Speaker 1>feeling German attacks over the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

623
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:24.740
<v Speaker 1>but the British and the French who </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't seen the German army on the </v>

624
00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:28.311
<v Speaker 1>offensive since way back in 1914.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of leisurely planning what </v>

625
00:36:28.311 --> 00:36:33.111
<v Speaker 1>they think will probably be their war </v>
<v Speaker 1>winning giant offensive slated for late </v>

626
00:36:33.111 --> 00:36:37.640
<v Speaker 1>spring or early summer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1916 over on the river somme and </v>

627
00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.630
<v Speaker 1>enormous joined British and French </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort with months of planning and and </v>

628
00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.800
<v Speaker 1>just sweeping everything in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

629
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:48.830
<v Speaker 1>That kind of rosy outlook and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans instead in late February,</v>

630
00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:50.490
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>

631
00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:55.940
<v Speaker 1>go on the offensive on the western front</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first time in more than a year </v>

632
00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:56.010
<v Speaker 1>and catch everyone off guard.</v>

633
00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:01.730
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous that they could have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of effort that was required to </v>

634
00:37:02.371 --> 00:37:07.371
<v Speaker 1>put together a modern offensive is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something we modern people take for </v>

635
00:37:07.371 --> 00:37:11.481
<v Speaker 1>granted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you hear how much planning and </v>

636
00:37:11.481 --> 00:37:15.741
<v Speaker 1>stockpiling and engineering feats are </v>
<v Speaker 1>required to pull off something like the </v>

637
00:37:15.781 --> 00:37:19.950
<v Speaker 1>battle of Verdun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you begin to see why it was so different</v>

638
00:37:19.951 --> 00:37:22.230
<v Speaker 1>than anything these people had ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>known in the past.</v>

639
00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:27.740
<v Speaker 1>As we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 years before and Napoleonic battle </v>

640
00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:30.441
<v Speaker 1>was considered extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it went on for three days throughout </v>

641
00:37:30.441 --> 00:37:32.010
<v Speaker 1>most of human history battles take </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

642
00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:37.850
<v Speaker 1>These battles that these allied and </v>
<v Speaker 1>central power planners are conducting </v>

643
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:44.240
<v Speaker 1>require months of preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all go on for months to how do you </v>

644
00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:49.131
<v Speaker 1>get enough stuff there to make sure your</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers don't starve or run out of </v>

645
00:37:49.131 --> 00:37:49.890
<v Speaker 1>ammunition?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

646
00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:55.550
<v Speaker 1>for the battle of Verdun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was more than seven weeks of actual </v>

647
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:59.430
<v Speaker 1>unloading of supplies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the way writer Gj Meyer describes</v>

648
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:04.380
<v Speaker 1>the planning and stockpiling before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>February 1916 battle quote,</v>

649
00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.390
<v Speaker 1>the Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

650
00:38:06.391 --> 00:38:09.930
<v Speaker 1>we're accomplishing prodigious feats in </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting everything in place,</v>

651
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:12.600
<v Speaker 1>helped by the Heli,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't countryside,</v>

652
00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.210
<v Speaker 1>and the cloudy winter weather of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Verdun region.</v>

653
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:20.450
<v Speaker 1>They were doing an astonishingly good </v>
<v Speaker 1>job of keeping the French from learning </v>

654
00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:24.261
<v Speaker 1>what they intended to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or when or even exactly were no fewer </v>

655
00:38:24.261 --> 00:38:28.761
<v Speaker 1>than five new railway lines were </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed across the German held </v>

656
00:38:28.761 --> 00:38:32.040
<v Speaker 1>portion of the plateau immediately to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the east of the verdant hills in a seven</v>

657
00:38:32.041 --> 00:38:35.190
<v Speaker 1>week period between late December and </v>
<v Speaker 1>early February,</v>

658
00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:36.430
<v Speaker 1>1300</v>

659
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.830
<v Speaker 6>trains,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not railway cars,</v>

660
00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:43.660
<v Speaker 6>but entire trains hauled in two point 5 </v>
<v Speaker 6>million shells,</v>

661
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:48.960
<v Speaker 6>earthmoving equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>construction machinery and everything </v>

662
00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.860
<v Speaker 6>required to prepare the offensive and </v>
<v Speaker 6>support 300,000</v>

663
00:38:50.861 --> 00:38:53.740
<v Speaker 6>troops in winter came rolling up to </v>
<v Speaker 6>Verdun.</v>

664
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:59.010
<v Speaker 6>The guns were positioned in the woods </v>
<v Speaker 6>and covered with camouflage and new </v>

665
00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.570
<v Speaker 6>development in warfare made necessary by</v>
<v Speaker 6>aerial reconnaissance.</v>

666
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.070
<v Speaker 6>Underground chambers capable of holding </v>
<v Speaker 6>as many as $500,</v>

667
00:39:05.071 --> 00:39:07.960
<v Speaker 6>million each.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're escovedo opposite the French lines</v>

668
00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:10.750
<v Speaker 6>and lined with steel and concrete in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>sky.</v>

669
00:39:10.751 --> 00:39:15.751
<v Speaker 6>Above all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this was the greatest concentration of </v>

670
00:39:15.751 --> 00:39:16.930
<v Speaker 6>aircraft yet seen on any front 150 </v>
<v Speaker 6>aircraft,</v>

671
00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:22.110
<v Speaker 6>a German umbrella,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so impenetrable that even on the rare </v>

672
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:25.590
<v Speaker 6>days when visibility was good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the French pilots were unable to get a </v>

673
00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:27.130
<v Speaker 6>close look at what was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 6>By the second week of February,</v>

674
00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:32.280
<v Speaker 6>everything was in place for an offensive</v>
<v Speaker 6>with the potential to change the course </v>

675
00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.641
<v Speaker 6>of the war and the German plan was </v>
<v Speaker 6>complicated and it was complicated </v>

676
00:39:38.621 --> 00:39:43.621
<v Speaker 6>because this was one of the great </v>
<v Speaker 6>defensive spots in French history for </v>

677
00:39:43.621 --> 00:39:45.610
<v Speaker 6>Don wasn't just a fortress.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a fortress zone.</v>

678
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.990
<v Speaker 6>Multiple fortresses all working together</v>

679
00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:55.490
<v Speaker 6>ground that had been fought over since </v>
<v Speaker 6>the day of Julius Caesar and the Romans </v>

680
00:39:56.370 --> 00:40:01.370
<v Speaker 6>fortifications that had been upgraded.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even as recently as 1914 when the </v>

681
00:40:01.861 --> 00:40:05.100
<v Speaker 6>lessons of what happened to those </v>
<v Speaker 6>Belgian forts were incorporated,</v>

682
00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:10.610
<v Speaker 6>and then when the war started,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the French high command decided that </v>

683
00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:15.171
<v Speaker 6>fortresses we're old fashioned due to </v>
<v Speaker 6>the limits of new technology or rather </v>

684
00:40:15.241 --> 00:40:20.241
<v Speaker 6>the lack of limits.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They decided that those Belgian forts </v>

685
00:40:20.241 --> 00:40:21.870
<v Speaker 6>being pounded by,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that artillery signaled that these forts</v>

686
00:40:21.871 --> 00:40:26.871
<v Speaker 6>were nothing but a death trap,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it would be better to take the </v>

687
00:40:26.871 --> 00:40:30.591
<v Speaker 6>weapons on them and the troops that man </v>
<v Speaker 6>them and put them to where the hotspots </v>

688
00:40:30.591 --> 00:40:30.600
<v Speaker 6>were in the fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>After all,</v>

689
00:40:30.601 --> 00:40:34.790
<v Speaker 6>if Francis in a life or death struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what are we putting a 100,000</v>

690
00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:39.810
<v Speaker 6>or more troops in the ridden region to </v>
<v Speaker 6>man a bunch of fortresses that are just </v>

691
00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:40.380
<v Speaker 6>going to trap them and get them killed </v>
<v Speaker 6>by artillery.</v>

692
00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:42.420
<v Speaker 6>Let's put them where they're needed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

693
00:40:42.421 --> 00:40:45.270
<v Speaker 6>Make sure they bring the guns and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>ammunition and everything else.</v>

694
00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:50.660
<v Speaker 6>So they did for don was a relatively </v>
<v Speaker 6>relatively quiet sector in 1916 before </v>

695
00:40:52.291 --> 00:40:54.450
<v Speaker 6>the big German buildup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nonetheless,</v>

696
00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:59.451
<v Speaker 6>you can't hide preparations as extensive</v>
<v Speaker 6>as the German preparations for wherever </v>

697
00:40:59.451 --> 00:41:02.580
<v Speaker 6>the French become aware of it a couple </v>
<v Speaker 6>of weeks before the Germans launch their</v>

698
00:41:02.581 --> 00:41:05.460
<v Speaker 6>attack and are quickly trying to make up</v>
<v Speaker 6>for lost ground and get stuff,</v>

699
00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:10.720
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to these areas because they can sense a </v>

700
00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:10.720
<v Speaker 6>buildup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the Germans are launching,</v>

701
00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.760
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>distracting attacks elsewhere to sort of</v>

702
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:13.920
<v Speaker 6>confused the French on where </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything's coming from.</v>

703
00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:18.030
<v Speaker 6>And on February 21st after a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 6>postponements due to bad weather,</v>

704
00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:23.450
<v Speaker 6>the storm breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's kicked off by a giant naval gun </v>

705
00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:26.370
<v Speaker 6>whose nickname,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>

706
00:41:26.371 --> 00:41:29.100
<v Speaker 6>as long Max,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just like naming swords,</v>

707
00:41:29.101 --> 00:41:34.101
<v Speaker 6>got a name the guns to apparently and </v>
<v Speaker 6>long Max fires a shell that travels</v>

708
00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:39.440
<v Speaker 1>somewhere between 15 and 20 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are enormous weapons.</v>

709
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:45.040
<v Speaker 1>And that becomes the first shelter drop </v>
<v Speaker 1>as part of the giant barrage that kicks </v>

710
00:41:46.071 --> 00:41:51.071
<v Speaker 1>off the battle of Verdun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And right after long Max is barrage </v>

711
00:41:51.071 --> 00:41:53.960
<v Speaker 1>kicks off all these enormous weapons </v>
<v Speaker 1>open up.</v>

712
00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:58.340
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just between 1200 to 1500 guns,</v>

713
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:03.230
<v Speaker 1>it's that half of them are huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have all those guns that pounded the</v>

714
00:42:03.231 --> 00:42:08.231
<v Speaker 1>fortunate Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those giant 420 millimeter gamma </v>

715
00:42:08.231 --> 00:42:11.261
<v Speaker 1>mortars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had the 380 millimeter Skoda pieces </v>

716
00:42:11.261 --> 00:42:11.960
<v Speaker 1>from Austria and you have more of each </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

717
00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:15.330
<v Speaker 1>And then you have an enormous number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>210 millimeters and,</v>

718
00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:18.950
<v Speaker 1>and one seventies and 1:55.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean my goodness,</v>

719
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:24.640
<v Speaker 1>and they open up all at once and begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounding this relatively small area of </v>

720
00:42:25.191 --> 00:42:30.191
<v Speaker 1>the front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes this so incredibly damaging </v>

721
00:42:30.191 --> 00:42:33.491
<v Speaker 1>is do you have these huge weapons </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounding this relatively tiny area on a </v>

722
00:42:33.491 --> 00:42:37.490
<v Speaker 1>map and you fire an enormous number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shells by any standard,</v>

723
00:42:37.491 --> 00:42:40.520
<v Speaker 1>the first world war in a short period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

724
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:46.150
<v Speaker 1>So if you're on the ground at some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those 1915 battles and they're firing </v>

725
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:49.541
<v Speaker 1>one point 7 million shells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're doing it over two or three </v>

726
00:42:49.541 --> 00:42:52.841
<v Speaker 1>or four weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intensity on the ground is very </v>

727
00:42:52.841 --> 00:42:55.451
<v Speaker 1>different than if they're firing 2 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million shells in six days</v>

728
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:59.940
<v Speaker 1>over a tiny area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One little wood on the battlefield,</v>

729
00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:04.050
<v Speaker 1>a thousand yards by 500 yards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took 80,000</v>

730
00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:07.470
<v Speaker 1>shells in the first week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that look like?</v>

731
00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:10.890
<v Speaker 1>There's no human reference for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to picture.</v>

732
00:43:10.891 --> 00:43:15.891
<v Speaker 1>I closed my eyes and I try to picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>forests disappearing in front of my </v>

733
00:43:15.891 --> 00:43:16.720
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is heavily wooded,</v>

734
00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.600
<v Speaker 1>forested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hilly terrain and burden.</v>

735
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.900
<v Speaker 1>And right after the bombardment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

736
00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:22.830
<v Speaker 1>24 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no forest laughed.</v>

737
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:28.190
<v Speaker 1>I've watched forests belonged over weeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and months and it's still appalling to </v>

738
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:32.451
<v Speaker 1>wake up and more forest is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you got to watch the entire </v>

739
00:43:32.451 --> 00:43:32.970
<v Speaker 1>thing churned up in front of you in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter of hours,</v>

740
00:43:32.971 --> 00:43:37.890
<v Speaker 1>like a giant celestial weed whacker and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chewing up grass.</v>

741
00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:40.620
<v Speaker 1>There are accounts that say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

742
00:43:40.621 --> 00:43:43.320
<v Speaker 1>you'd have the shelling is so intensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a giant tree,</v>

743
00:43:43.321 --> 00:43:45.750
<v Speaker 1>would get blown up in the air and before</v>
<v Speaker 1>it lands on the ground again,</v>

744
00:43:45.751 --> 00:43:47.850
<v Speaker 1>another shell hits it and blows it right</v>
<v Speaker 1>back up in the air.</v>

745
00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:53.090
<v Speaker 1>A veteran said that the battlefield </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly looked like an asparagus farm </v>

746
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:55.290
<v Speaker 1>with giant shoots shooting up all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the soil everywhere,</v>

747
00:43:55.291 --> 00:43:57.990
<v Speaker 1>which are the tree stumps and wood </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

748
00:43:57.991 --> 00:44:02.991
<v Speaker 1>Needless to say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something I would have to have </v>

749
00:44:03.421 --> 00:44:06.480
<v Speaker 1>some sort of video have to imagine when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a kid.</v>

750
00:44:06.481 --> 00:44:08.130
<v Speaker 1>I used to wonder what a tsunami looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

751
00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:09.420
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

752
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:15.230
<v Speaker 1>now of course we have video of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was unimaginable when I was young.</v>

753
00:44:15.231 --> 00:44:20.231
<v Speaker 1>Now it's something anyone who wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see it can go look up on youtube or </v>

754
00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:25.600
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a very rare sight and natural </v>

755
00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:25.600
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon or a manmade phenomenon for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to see.</v>

756
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Shelling is the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

757
00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:32.560
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot fewer accounts than you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might imagine of the first day shelling </v>

758
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:36.080
<v Speaker 1>at the battle of Verdun and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

759
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:41.330
<v Speaker 1>that's an English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm sure there must be more German </v>

760
00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:44.391
<v Speaker 1>and French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's important to point out that </v>

761
00:44:44.391 --> 00:44:46.581
<v Speaker 1>there aren't a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably survived the war in tact after </v>

762
00:44:46.581 --> 00:44:50.841
<v Speaker 1>those battles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the ones who did were probably not </v>

763
00:44:50.841 --> 00:44:51.990
<v Speaker 1>all that excited to relive the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

764
00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:56.160
<v Speaker 1>We do have some things though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's 40 years old.</v>

765
00:44:56.161 --> 00:45:01.161
<v Speaker 1>Alister Horns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the price of glory has some of the best </v>

766
00:45:01.161 --> 00:45:03.750
<v Speaker 1>accounts in English of what it was like </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the ground.</v>

767
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:08.750
<v Speaker 1>When the shelling started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tells one story of a corporal who is </v>

768
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:10.380
<v Speaker 1>with his buddies and they're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>grinding some coffee.</v>

769
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.230
<v Speaker 1>When the first shell start dropping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he writes,</v>

770
00:45:13.231 --> 00:45:18.231
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly the whole world seemed to </v>

771
00:45:18.231 --> 00:45:19.350
<v Speaker 1>disintegrate around him with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition to Alacrity of old soldiers.</v>

772
00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:22.380
<v Speaker 1>The two men with the coffee grinder </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared below ground,</v>

773
00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:26.670
<v Speaker 1>cursing and unprintable French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why couldn't the bastards wait until I'd</v>

774
00:45:26.671 --> 00:45:31.671
<v Speaker 1>finished my coffee?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The air in the way that little forested </v>

775
00:45:31.671 --> 00:45:35.961
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are seemed solid with whirling </v>

776
00:45:35.961 --> 00:45:38.511
<v Speaker 1>material to Corporal Stephane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was as if it were swept by a quote </v>

777
00:45:38.511 --> 00:45:41.550
<v Speaker 1>storm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hurricane attempt tempest growing ever</v>

778
00:45:41.551 --> 00:45:46.551
<v Speaker 1>stronger where it was raining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but paving stones and quote Horn</v>

779
00:45:46.741 --> 00:45:51.741
<v Speaker 1>continues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote upon the terrible dean of the </v>

780
00:45:51.741 --> 00:45:54.060
<v Speaker 1>explosions were superimposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The splintering crashes of rending would</v>

781
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:59.240
<v Speaker 1>as the great 210 millimeter shells </v>
<v Speaker 1>lopped off branches or uprooted the </v>

782
00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.500
<v Speaker 1>trees themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barely had the tree trunks fallen.</v>

783
00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Then they were spewed up into the air </v>
<v Speaker 1>again by fresh eruptions from his own </v>

784
00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:08.940
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still relatively immune to the shelling.</v>

785
00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Stephane watched it's methodical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress with the certain macabre </v>

786
00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:16.350
<v Speaker 1>fascination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a garden hose he thought and</v>

787
00:46:16.351 --> 00:46:21.351
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he describes how the shells </v>

788
00:46:21.351 --> 00:46:24.600
<v Speaker 1>would move like a wave from one location</v>
<v Speaker 1>to another,</v>

789
00:46:24.601 --> 00:46:29.601
<v Speaker 1>pounding everything in between and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>methodically go back in the direction </v>

790
00:46:29.601 --> 00:46:33.741
<v Speaker 1>that just came from as though it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually mowing the same piece of </v>

791
00:46:33.741 --> 00:46:37.491
<v Speaker 1>ground over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows you what the plan had been </v>

792
00:46:37.501 --> 00:46:42.030
<v Speaker 1>before they started to make sure every </v>
<v Speaker 1>inch of ground was covered.</v>

793
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.500
<v Speaker 1>German aircraft are flying over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battlefield,</v>

794
00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:51.860
<v Speaker 1>having knocked the French air force out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the sky and are spotting for their </v>

795
00:46:51.931 --> 00:46:56.931
<v Speaker 1>guns and keeping the French planes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>locating the German guns so the French </v>

796
00:46:57.361 --> 00:47:02.361
<v Speaker 1>guns could shoot at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This leads to a very one sided initial </v>

797
00:47:02.361 --> 00:47:03.170
<v Speaker 1>encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Historian Polygon.</v>

798
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Koski compares the initial bombardment </v>
<v Speaker 1>here to the 1915 bottle of champagne,</v>

799
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:12.450
<v Speaker 1>which at the time seemed momentously </v>
<v Speaker 1>titanic.</v>

800
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:14.010
<v Speaker 1>That was a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

801
00:47:14.011 --> 00:47:19.011
<v Speaker 1>a year later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like chump change compared to </v>

802
00:47:19.011 --> 00:47:21.050
<v Speaker 1>what the first day at Verdun is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>priests aging.</v>

803
00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Jen Koski writes quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was partly because of such air cover,</v>

804
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:30.350
<v Speaker 1>partly because it enjoys such free rein </v>
<v Speaker 1>that morning that the German</v>

805
00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:35.350
<v Speaker 6>shelling could exceed in intensity </v>
<v Speaker 6>anything the French or anyone else had </v>

806
00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:39.811
<v Speaker 6>ever endured.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This was the bottle of champagne </v>

807
00:47:39.811 --> 00:47:42.631
<v Speaker 6>multiplied 10 times over,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but where the difference in kind as </v>

808
00:47:42.631 --> 00:47:46.291
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the German artillerist were blanketing </v>

809
00:47:46.291 --> 00:47:48.930
<v Speaker 6>entire zones with their shells.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They directed their fire not merely onto</v>

810
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:53.050
<v Speaker 6>positions they wished to take or onto </v>
<v Speaker 6>lines they wish to obliterate,</v>

811
00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:57.670
<v Speaker 6>but into all that nature had grown and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that man had erected as well,</v>

812
00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:01.960
<v Speaker 6>making up in density for what they </v>
<v Speaker 6>lacked in precision that day.</v>

813
00:48:01.961 --> 00:48:06.760
<v Speaker 6>They saturated successive zones within a</v>
<v Speaker 6>25 mile arc between albacore on the left</v>

814
00:48:06.761 --> 00:48:11.761
<v Speaker 6>bank and attained on the right bank of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the Muse with a million high explosive </v>

815
00:48:11.761 --> 00:48:13.240
<v Speaker 6>shells of the heaviest caliber known </v>
<v Speaker 6>demand,</v>

816
00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:16.780
<v Speaker 6>200 8,305,</v>
<v Speaker 6>380,</v>

817
00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:21.960
<v Speaker 6>even 420 millimeters wide and with </v>
<v Speaker 6>lesser shells bearing toxic gases as </v>

818
00:48:22.061 --> 00:48:27.061
<v Speaker 6>well method rather than rage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The system of the power hammer rather </v>

819
00:48:27.061 --> 00:48:30.580
<v Speaker 6>than the obstinacy of the battering ram </v>
<v Speaker 6>drove the destruction,</v>

820
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:35.820
<v Speaker 6>the morbid calculus per se,</v>
<v Speaker 6>aged the carpet bombing of later wars </v>

821
00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:38.680
<v Speaker 6>that would raise entire cities and </v>
<v Speaker 6>ignite entire landscapes.</v>

822
00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:43.890
<v Speaker 6>But for now the thought was purely </v>
<v Speaker 6>tactical to devastate so that the </v>

823
00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:44.680
<v Speaker 6>infantry could infiltrate</v>

824
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.600
<v Speaker 1>into quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

825
00:48:47.601 --> 00:48:50.180
<v Speaker 1>as Jen Koski says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference in this artillery barrage</v>

826
00:48:50.181 --> 00:48:52.610
<v Speaker 1>is not just in the amount of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way they do it.</v>

827
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:58.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're employing every little trick </v>

828
00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.400
<v Speaker 1>that they've learned in the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>year and a half of warfare,</v>

829
00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:02.780
<v Speaker 1>including one that they probably think </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a clever enhancement.</v>

830
00:49:02.781 --> 00:49:04.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure the British and the French must</v>
<v Speaker 1>have thought it.</v>

831
00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Another example of deviousness on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>German part,</v>

832
00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:09.860
<v Speaker 1>but the Germans start this artillery </v>
<v Speaker 1>barrage,</v>

833
00:49:09.861 --> 00:49:14.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little after seven in the morning and </v>

834
00:49:14.861 --> 00:49:15.890
<v Speaker 1>they pound these French positions all </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and into the lunchtime hour,</v>

835
00:49:15.891 --> 00:49:19.250
<v Speaker 1>and then they stop at midday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stop on Cue all at once.</v>

836
00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Now even to the punch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk French survivors on the receiving </v>

837
00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:27.200
<v Speaker 1>end of the worst artillery barrage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>human history.</v>

838
00:49:27.201 --> 00:49:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Know what this means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always means the same thing.</v>

839
00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:33.320
<v Speaker 1>It means the German ground troops are </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in an offensive.</v>

840
00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:36.140
<v Speaker 1>That's why you stopped shooting so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't blow your own men up.</v>

841
00:49:36.141 --> 00:49:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Now that they're on the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

842
00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:39.830
<v Speaker 1>So the French runup to their positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they man,</v>

843
00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:45.280
<v Speaker 1>their defensive spots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they uncover any guns they've got hit </v>

844
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.190
<v Speaker 1>and they get ready to push back the </v>
<v Speaker 1>German assault.</v>

845
00:49:46.191 --> 00:49:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Now that it's coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except that it isn't coming.</v>

846
00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:53.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a trick and all of a sudden all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guns opened up again and start smashing </v>

847
00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:58.901
<v Speaker 1>the now exposed French survivors who </v>
<v Speaker 1>show those planes up in the air among </v>

848
00:49:58.901 --> 00:49:59.630
<v Speaker 1>other observers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

849
00:49:59.631 --> 00:50:00.740
<v Speaker 1>That guy's revived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

850
00:50:00.741 --> 00:50:02.390
<v Speaker 1>there's a machine gun nest we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

851
00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:08.020
<v Speaker 1>It was an intermission to get the French</v>
<v Speaker 1>to expose themselves and this shelan </v>

852
00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:11.210
<v Speaker 1>goes for the rest of the day until the </v>
<v Speaker 1>late afternoon,</v>

853
00:50:11.211 --> 00:50:14.720
<v Speaker 1>so from seven something in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>to force something in the afternoon,</v>

854
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:20.200
<v Speaker 1>and then the French survivors see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first signs of German infantry activity </v>

855
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:25.061
<v Speaker 1>approaching what they see looks like </v>
<v Speaker 1>something out of a time machine from the</v>

856
00:50:28.341 --> 00:50:33.341
<v Speaker 1>hitlarian Arab gone are the iconic </v>
<v Speaker 1>pickle.</v>

857
00:50:34.191 --> 00:50:39.191
<v Speaker 1>How by the pointed helmets that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>German troops were that hearkened back </v>

858
00:50:39.191 --> 00:50:41.930
<v Speaker 1>to the greatness of Prussia in Europe at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the height of its 19th century,</v>

859
00:50:41.931 --> 00:50:46.931
<v Speaker 1>sort of colonial dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's symbolic and it's been replaced </v>

860
00:50:46.931 --> 00:50:47.690
<v Speaker 1>with something that looks like a minor </v>
<v Speaker 1>should wear it</v>

861
00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.070
<v Speaker 1>thoroughly working class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing romantic,</v>

862
00:50:52.071 --> 00:50:54.750
<v Speaker 1>gentlemanly officer or a risk socratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

863
00:50:56.090 --> 00:51:01.090
<v Speaker 1>These tip of the spear troops here are </v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing the German style helm,</v>

864
00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:06.760
<v Speaker 1>which with a minor modification or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the exact same helmet the German </v>

865
00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:08.810
<v Speaker 1>troops will were in the Second World </v>
<v Speaker 1>War.</v>

866
00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:13.490
<v Speaker 1>These storm troopers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they're called and have been known to</v>

867
00:51:13.491 --> 00:51:18.491
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look like the Wehrmacht and they're </v>

868
00:51:18.491 --> 00:51:22.600
<v Speaker 1>carrying flame throwers among other </v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty surprises for anyone.</v>

869
00:51:23.061 --> 00:51:25.190
<v Speaker 1>They might run into the gun machine guns</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

870
00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:30.220
<v Speaker 1>They got men who are wearing clothes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have big bags sort of as part of </v>

871
00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:34.190
<v Speaker 1>the where they can stuff hand grenades </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you just can't carry enough hand</v>

872
00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:37.040
<v Speaker 1>grenades when you need them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've even got in this,</v>

873
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:38.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows you what they think.</v>

874
00:51:38.391 --> 00:51:40.820
<v Speaker 1>They're up against melee weapons with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

875
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:46.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these storm troop type units are </v>

876
00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:48.161
<v Speaker 1>famous for the clubs they carry or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hatchets or the long knives or even </v>

877
00:51:48.381 --> 00:51:50.060
<v Speaker 1>things like brass knuckles and stuff.</v>

878
00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:54.740
<v Speaker 1>These are people who expect to get into </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical combat at very close range.</v>

879
00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:00.760
<v Speaker 1>They are using what at the time seemed </v>
<v Speaker 1>like very new fangled,</v>

880
00:52:01.251 --> 00:52:04.070
<v Speaker 1>very modern techniques on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battlefield.</v>

881
00:52:04.071 --> 00:52:08.000
<v Speaker 1>They're known as infiltration tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pretty much are the same small unit</v>

882
00:52:08.001 --> 00:52:10.460
<v Speaker 1>tactics every military in the world uses</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

883
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.980
<v Speaker 1>They've been in development for a while </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

884
00:52:12.981 --> 00:52:17.981
<v Speaker 1>It's a myth to suggest that the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time anybody sees them as with these </v>

885
00:52:17.981 --> 00:52:21.781
<v Speaker 1>storm troops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these storm troops are the first to </v>

886
00:52:21.781 --> 00:52:22.460
<v Speaker 1>integrate everything into their system </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

887
00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Not only are they going to use these </v>
<v Speaker 1>infiltration tactics,</v>

888
00:52:24.861 --> 00:52:29.861
<v Speaker 1>but look at the weapons that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>armed themselves with and they've </v>

889
00:52:29.861 --> 00:52:29.861
<v Speaker 1>trained with all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

890
00:52:29.861 --> 00:52:33.041
<v Speaker 1>they've integrated all the various ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>and theories from all the militaries </v>

891
00:52:33.041 --> 00:52:36.161
<v Speaker 1>around the world for the last 15 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>and are the first to put these troops </v>

892
00:52:36.161 --> 00:52:39.491
<v Speaker 1>out in the field whose job it is to look</v>
<v Speaker 1>for weak spots and they call them the </v>

893
00:52:40.221 --> 00:52:42.560
<v Speaker 1>field and when they run into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

894
00:52:42.561 --> 00:52:47.561
<v Speaker 1>significant opposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stop or move around it in places </v>

895
00:52:47.561 --> 00:52:50.740
<v Speaker 1>where everyone's been killed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>artillery barrage they punched right </v>

896
00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:54.071
<v Speaker 1>through there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their goal is to capture bait.</v>

897
00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a trap.</v>

898
00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:03.290
<v Speaker 1>The cheese in the trap has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>captured by the Germans before it can </v>

899
00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:06.300
<v Speaker 1>play the role of cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what this is all about.</v>

900
00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.650
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you believe,</v>

901
00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:09.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the standard historical approach,</v>

902
00:53:09.331 --> 00:53:14.331
<v Speaker 1>this quite a few historians who believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole idea of let's create this </v>

903
00:53:14.331 --> 00:53:16.710
<v Speaker 1>meat grinder is bs propaganda at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

904
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:18.300
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

905
00:53:18.301 --> 00:53:20.700
<v Speaker 1>mia culpa avoidance later on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

906
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.550
<v Speaker 1>If you believe that they're not trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to capture bait,</v>

907
00:53:23.551 --> 00:53:25.680
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to capture her done </v>
<v Speaker 1>either way.</v>

908
00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

909
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:29.250
<v Speaker 6>point of this initial attack is to get </v>
<v Speaker 6>the heights.</v>

910
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:35.270
<v Speaker 6>The problem is the Germans find out to a</v>
<v Speaker 6>degree exactly what the French and the </v>

911
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:36.120
<v Speaker 6>British had found out the whole year </v>
<v Speaker 6>before,</v>

912
00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:39.780
<v Speaker 6>which is that no matter how good the </v>
<v Speaker 6>artillery barrage,</v>

913
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:44.970
<v Speaker 6>there are just units that survive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then when they strike back at you,</v>

914
00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:50.130
<v Speaker 6>it's amazing and the casualties mounted </v>
<v Speaker 6>up unbelievably fast.</v>

915
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:55.880
<v Speaker 6>On the very first day as the German </v>
<v Speaker 6>troops pour into an area and begin to </v>

916
00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:00.480
<v Speaker 6>coalesce and sort of muster in us in a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in a specific area,</v>

917
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:05.310
<v Speaker 6>French artillery opens up on them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And this is an account by a French staff</v>

918
00:54:05.311 --> 00:54:10.311
<v Speaker 6>officer with the artillery who first </v>
<v Speaker 6>describes what the German artillery </v>

919
00:54:10.311 --> 00:54:14.421
<v Speaker 6>attack on his positions is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then describes responding in kind </v>

920
00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:18.210
<v Speaker 6>his was one of the few batteries that </v>
<v Speaker 6>did by the way he writes,</v>

921
00:54:18.211 --> 00:54:23.211
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 6>thousands of projectiles are flying in </v>

922
00:54:23.211 --> 00:54:23.550
<v Speaker 6>all directions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some whistling,</v>

923
00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:25.530
<v Speaker 6>others howling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>others moaning,</v>

924
00:54:25.531 --> 00:54:30.531
<v Speaker 6>low and all uniting into one infernal </v>
<v Speaker 6>roar from time to time and Ariel torpedo</v>

925
00:54:30.871 --> 00:54:35.871
<v Speaker 6>passes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>making a noise like a giant motor car </v>

926
00:54:35.871 --> 00:54:38.960
<v Speaker 6>with a tremendous thud,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a giant shell bursts quite close to our </v>

927
00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:42.981
<v Speaker 6>observation post,</v>
<v Speaker 6>breaking the telephone wire and </v>

928
00:54:42.981 --> 00:54:43.290
<v Speaker 6>interrupting all communication with our </v>
<v Speaker 6>batteries.</v>

929
00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:48.560
<v Speaker 6>A man gets out at once for repairs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>crawling along his stomach through all </v>

930
00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:52.260
<v Speaker 6>this place of bursting minds and shells,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it seems quite impossible.</v>

931
00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:57.320
<v Speaker 6>He writes that he should escape the rain</v>
<v Speaker 6>of shells which exceeds anything </v>

932
00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:01.281
<v Speaker 6>imaginable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There has never been such a bombardment </v>

933
00:55:01.281 --> 00:55:03.741
<v Speaker 6>and war.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Our man seems to be envelops and </v>

934
00:55:03.741 --> 00:55:06.291
<v Speaker 6>explosions and shelters himself from </v>
<v Speaker 6>time to time in the shell craters which </v>

935
00:55:06.291 --> 00:55:07.080
<v Speaker 6>honeycomb the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Finally,</v>

936
00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:10.230
<v Speaker 6>he reaches a less stormy spot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>men's his wires,</v>

937
00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:12.990
<v Speaker 6>and then as it would be madness to try </v>
<v Speaker 6>to return,</v>

938
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:16.440
<v Speaker 6>settles down in a big crater and waits </v>
<v Speaker 6>for the storm to pass.</v>

939
00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:21.390
<v Speaker 6>Now he looks up and sees the German </v>
<v Speaker 6>assaults.</v>

940
00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:26.450
<v Speaker 6>Approaching quote beyond in the valley,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dark masses are moving over the snow </v>

941
00:55:26.791 --> 00:55:31.791
<v Speaker 6>covered ground.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is German infantry advancing impact </v>

942
00:55:31.791 --> 00:55:32.610
<v Speaker 6>formation along the valley to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>attack.</v>

943
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:36.270
<v Speaker 6>They look like a big gray carpet being </v>
<v Speaker 6>unrolled over the country.</v>

944
00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:39.930
<v Speaker 6>We telephone through to the batteries </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the ball begins.</v>

945
00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:44.610
<v Speaker 6>The site is hellish in the distance in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the valley and upon the slopes,</v>

946
00:55:44.611 --> 00:55:49.170
<v Speaker 6>regimens spread out and as they deploy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fresh troops come pouring in,</v>

947
00:55:49.530 --> 00:55:52.620
<v Speaker 6>there's a whistle over our heads.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's our first shell.</v>

948
00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.380
<v Speaker 6>It falls right in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>enemy infantry.</v>

949
00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:59.340
<v Speaker 6>We telephone through telling our </v>
<v Speaker 6>batteries of their hit and a delusion of</v>

950
00:55:59.341 --> 00:56:03.840
<v Speaker 6>heavy shells is poured on the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Their physician becomes critical through</v>

951
00:56:03.841 --> 00:56:05.340
<v Speaker 6>glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We can see men,</v>

952
00:56:05.341 --> 00:56:09.300
<v Speaker 6>maddened men covered with earth and </v>
<v Speaker 6>blood falling one upon the other.</v>

953
00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:11.970
<v Speaker 6>When the first wave of the assault is </v>
<v Speaker 6>decimated,</v>

954
00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:14.430
<v Speaker 6>the ground is dotted with heaps of </v>
<v Speaker 6>corpses,</v>

955
00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:17.580
<v Speaker 6>but the second wave is already pressing </v>
<v Speaker 6>on once more.</v>

956
00:56:17.581 --> 00:56:19.980
<v Speaker 6>Our shells carve awful gaps in their </v>
<v Speaker 6>ranks.</v>

957
00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.260
<v Speaker 6>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like an army of rats,</v>

958
00:56:22.261 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 6>the bushes continue to advance in</v>

959
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.490
<v Speaker 1>spite of our Mar Mites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a term the French use for their shells.</v>

960
00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:28.570
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

961
00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:31.510
<v Speaker 1>than our heavy artillery burst forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In theory,</v>

962
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:36.630
<v Speaker 1>the whole valley is turned into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>volcano and it's exit is stopped by the </v>

963
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:40.651
<v Speaker 1>barrier of the slain and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a foretaste of what's to come </v>

964
00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:47.250
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Germans have to be on the offensive </v>

965
00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:50.050
<v Speaker 1>for a little while in this battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a battle that is probably built upon the</v>

966
00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:53.740
<v Speaker 1>presumption that the defense has a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage on the offense.</v>

967
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:56.290
<v Speaker 1>This artillery was meant to make up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of that,</v>

968
00:56:56.291 --> 00:57:00.790
<v Speaker 1>but the Germans are taking higher than </v>
<v Speaker 1>expected losses from minute one.</v>

969
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:03.640
<v Speaker 1>This is a problem too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because remember,</v>

970
00:57:03.970 --> 00:57:08.970
<v Speaker 1>regardless of which historical school </v>
<v Speaker 1>you adhere to on the point of this </v>

971
00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:12.481
<v Speaker 1>battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was always part of the plan to lose </v>

972
00:57:12.481 --> 00:57:14.000
<v Speaker 1>as few people as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Germans are concerned with losses</v>

973
00:57:14.001 --> 00:57:19.001
<v Speaker 1>and part of the reason they're suffering</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many is the French are resisting </v>

974
00:57:19.001 --> 00:57:20.080
<v Speaker 1>heroically on these first few days.</v>

975
00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:25.680
<v Speaker 1>There are units that surrender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are units that are just gone from </v>

976
00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:29.491
<v Speaker 1>the artillery barrage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are units including elite </v>

977
00:57:29.491 --> 00:57:29.560
<v Speaker 1>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also rather pedestrian.</v>

978
00:57:29.561 --> 00:57:34.060
<v Speaker 1>One's sitting there and dying to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last man to delay this German advance.</v>

979
00:57:34.061 --> 00:57:36.610
<v Speaker 1>These infiltration troops are looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>for places to push through.</v>

980
00:57:36.611 --> 00:57:41.611
<v Speaker 1>They find a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they find a bunch with these </v>

981
00:57:41.611 --> 00:57:44.290
<v Speaker 1>decimated defenders resisting heroically</v>
<v Speaker 1>to buy the country.</v>

982
00:57:44.291 --> 00:57:49.291
<v Speaker 1>Time to get fresh troops reinforcing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that area to that area of Verdun is </v>

983
00:57:49.481 --> 00:57:52.510
<v Speaker 1>actually supplied on the French side by </v>
<v Speaker 1>one little teeny road.</v>

984
00:57:53.590 --> 00:57:58.590
<v Speaker 1>The Germans had built multiple railway </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines and their site to supply the </v>

985
00:57:58.590 --> 00:57:58.590
<v Speaker 1>battlefield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

986
00:57:58.590 --> 00:58:00.040
<v Speaker 1>So as French reinforcements are coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

987
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:03.880
<v Speaker 1>these heroic defenders are holding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans off as long as they can.</v>

988
00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:09.120
<v Speaker 1>There are more big bombardments that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans push more troops in with more </v>

989
00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:11.890
<v Speaker 1>tenacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On February 25th,</v>

990
00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:17.610
<v Speaker 1>the Germans in an almost Indiana Light </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jones movie kind of drama capture the </v>

991
00:58:19.241 --> 00:58:20.680
<v Speaker 1>big fort in this region.</v>

992
00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:25.680
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of overlooks the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>battlefield and we told you that the </v>

993
00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:29.071
<v Speaker 1>French high command kind of lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in force after the Germans and </v>

994
00:58:29.071 --> 00:58:30.490
<v Speaker 1>smashed the ones in Belgium and smash </v>
<v Speaker 1>the early ones in France,</v>

995
00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:33.730
<v Speaker 1>but they still had people in them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there were still guns in them and slowly</v>

996
00:58:33.731 --> 00:58:38.731
<v Speaker 1>but surely they were starting to realize</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes and in some places they </v>

997
00:58:38.731 --> 00:58:38.890
<v Speaker 1>were worth having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't matter.</v>

998
00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.250
<v Speaker 1>These troops were in this fort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is mostly below ground.</v>

999
00:58:42.251 --> 00:58:47.251
<v Speaker 1>When a German soldier gets blown into it</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow due to a shell exploding nearby,</v>

1000
00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:53.340
<v Speaker 1>lands down on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a pistol with him and eventually </v>

1001
00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:57.091
<v Speaker 1>will lead in some friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by and large is walking around this </v>

1002
00:58:57.091 --> 00:58:58.810
<v Speaker 1>underground giant fort and as he opens </v>
<v Speaker 1>doors into rooms,</v>

1003
00:58:58.811 --> 00:59:03.811
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of French soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing cards or whatever and he </v>

1004
00:59:03.811 --> 00:59:06.361
<v Speaker 1>captures them and locked them in a room </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he does this over and over and over </v>

1005
00:59:06.361 --> 00:59:07.240
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He finally has everybody Kinda captured.</v>

1006
00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Nobody dies on either side and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>major feature in the early part of the </v>

1007
00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:17.101
<v Speaker 1>battle falls to the Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those situations that sort </v>

1008
00:59:17.501 --> 00:59:22.501
<v Speaker 1>of rocks the French morale and they to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall apart.</v>

1009
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:28.810
<v Speaker 1>They've been through eight ton and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this crisis moment where all of </v>

1010
00:59:29.571 --> 00:59:32.090
<v Speaker 1>a sudden it looks like the Germans are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to break through in the French are</v>

1011
00:59:32.091 --> 00:59:35.330
<v Speaker 1>just going to fall apart before any </v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforcements can stiffen the line.</v>

1012
00:59:35.810 --> 00:59:37.850
<v Speaker 1>This is where things get really wiggy in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this battle.</v>

1013
00:59:37.851 --> 00:59:38.450
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

1014
00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:43.680
<v Speaker 1>it gets right down to what the hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point of it is.</v>

1015
00:59:44.730 --> 00:59:49.730
<v Speaker 1>If you're a falcon hein and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>historians who think he's trying to </v>

1016
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:49.830
<v Speaker 1>create a meat grinder fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

1017
00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:53.820
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to break through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want Verdun.</v>

1018
00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:57.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not really what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the cheese in your trap.</v>

1019
00:59:57.690 --> 01:00:02.690
<v Speaker 1>If you take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're just going to get </v>

1020
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:02.690
<v Speaker 1>counterattack and you're going to lose a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of troops again and that then that's</v>

1021
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 all over again.</v>

1022
01:00:03.871 --> 01:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>What did we do differently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1023
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:08.720
<v Speaker 1>If you're from the other school of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought though,</v>

1024
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:14.230
<v Speaker 1>the idea of breaking through to Verdun </v>
<v Speaker 1>at this point is to nearly achieved what</v>

1025
01:00:14.721 --> 01:00:17.360
<v Speaker 1>the whole battle was designed to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexpectedly quickly.</v>

1026
01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:22.540
<v Speaker 1>The crown prince who's commanding those </v>
<v Speaker 1>armies really excited and there's all </v>

1027
01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:22.540
<v Speaker 1>sorts of messages where they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1028
01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:23.050
<v Speaker 1>I will take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1029
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:28.210
<v Speaker 1>didn't expect it this fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll take it and then they get </v>

1030
01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:32.321
<v Speaker 1>within two miles of the city at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>point and then the French put a new </v>

1031
01:00:32.321 --> 01:00:36.581
<v Speaker 1>commander in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy who will be famous by the way in </v>

1032
01:00:36.581 --> 01:00:38.350
<v Speaker 1>both world wars for different reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy named Pattan</v>

1033
01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>and pitocin becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1034
01:00:41.161 --> 01:00:46.161
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to separate the myth from the man when </v>

1035
01:00:46.161 --> 01:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with his connection to Verdun.</v>

1036
01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:52.460
<v Speaker 1>But the narrative is that baton gets in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and changes the French morale by </v>

1037
01:00:54.571 --> 01:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Practically.</v>

1038
01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>There's all these generals traveled with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own press corps.</v>

1039
01:00:58.891 --> 01:01:03.891
<v Speaker 1>So there's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is going to have a bunch of </v>

1040
01:01:03.891 --> 01:01:03.891
<v Speaker 1>people helping to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pump up the myth,</v>

1041
01:01:03.891 --> 01:01:06.030
<v Speaker 1>but he's famous for coming to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battlefield and you know,</v>

1042
01:01:06.031 --> 01:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>in these situations where the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>just look desperate,</v>

1043
01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at troops and going,</v>

1044
01:01:10.201 --> 01:01:12.600
<v Speaker 1>now we have them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got them right where we want them.</v>

1045
01:01:12.601 --> 01:01:13.800
<v Speaker 1>That kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1046
01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:17.040
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's the 19th century mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that seems to work.</v>

1047
01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>They famously says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or somebody says for him,</v>

1048
01:01:20.041 --> 01:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>and then he stands behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shall not pass.</v>

1049
01:01:23.310 --> 01:01:25.300
<v Speaker 1>And this becomes the big narrative of </v>
<v Speaker 1>redundant.</v>

1050
01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:30.320
<v Speaker 1>It turns into like a French thermopylae,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the French aren't going to die to </v>

1051
01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.230
<v Speaker 1>the last man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to win in the end,</v>

1052
01:01:31.231 --> 01:01:31.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's again,</v>

1053
01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:34.260
<v Speaker 1>part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this overriding narrative.</v>

1054
01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morale is kind of a hard to quantify as </v>

1055
01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:40.460
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to measure,</v>

1056
01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>hard to look back in history and prove </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1057
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to prove the real world </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrafirma things that Bhutan did.</v>

1058
01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Buttons and artillery guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a defensive specialist and the </v>

1059
01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:54.621
<v Speaker 1>first thing he does is bringing his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>artillery and consolidate it and asked </v>

1060
01:01:55.071 --> 01:02:00.071
<v Speaker 1>for more and slowly but surely begins to</v>
<v Speaker 1>build up his own meat grinder for two </v>

1061
01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:05.720
<v Speaker 1>can play at that game and Pitocin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start stocking up the French side with </v>

1062
01:02:05.881 --> 01:02:10.881
<v Speaker 1>our chiller re to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all this artillery turns this entire</v>

1063
01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:17.120
<v Speaker 1>area into the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But weirder these shell holes in your </v>

1064
01:02:19.831 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

1065
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.100
<v Speaker 6>You think of something symmetrical like </v>
<v Speaker 6>an immediate right crater.</v>

1066
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:26.040
<v Speaker 6>But it doesn't happen that way because </v>
<v Speaker 6>you get these shell holes,</v>

1067
01:02:26.041 --> 01:02:30.090
<v Speaker 6>which can be 30 feet deep with </v>
<v Speaker 6>absolutely straight up and down edges,</v>

1068
01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:33.990
<v Speaker 6>but then they get hit with another shell</v>
<v Speaker 6>at some weird angle or an on an edge and</v>

1069
01:02:33.991 --> 01:02:36.180
<v Speaker 6>then they get hit with another one and </v>
<v Speaker 6>another one and another one,</v>

1070
01:02:36.181 --> 01:02:39.210
<v Speaker 6>and it turns it into super weird </v>
<v Speaker 6>formations.</v>

1071
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.670
<v Speaker 6>It still looks weird today.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you go look at modern pictures of the</v>

1072
01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:47.680
<v Speaker 6>verdant battlefield,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it looks totally alien and it creates a </v>

1073
01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:53.331
<v Speaker 6>battlefield.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a painting by a Frenchman Larue </v>

1074
01:02:53.331 --> 01:02:53.331
<v Speaker 6>I think is his name,</v>
<v Speaker 6>called hell,</v>

1075
01:02:53.331 --> 01:02:57.590
<v Speaker 6>and it shows a couple of French soldiers</v>
<v Speaker 6>in one of these craters and a dead body </v>

1076
01:02:57.811 --> 01:03:02.811
<v Speaker 6>near them and they're wearing gas masks </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the barrage is going on in giant </v>

1077
01:03:02.811 --> 01:03:07.011
<v Speaker 6>timbers are part of this enormous crater</v>
<v Speaker 6>and craters everywhere in the distance </v>

1078
01:03:07.011 --> 01:03:07.011
<v Speaker 6>as far as you look.</v>

1079
01:03:08.310 --> 01:03:13.230
<v Speaker 6>We said this is like making war worse </v>
<v Speaker 6>and these craters are the grossest thing</v>

1080
01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:16.290
<v Speaker 6>you can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean really just awful.</v>

1081
01:03:16.770 --> 01:03:21.770
<v Speaker 6>They fill with water very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every one of them practically with a </v>

1082
01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:22.020
<v Speaker 6>dead body or two in them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they fill with water.</v>

1083
01:03:22.021 --> 01:03:23.700
<v Speaker 6>There's tons of trash,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tons of stuff.</v>

1084
01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:27.210
<v Speaker 6>I'm all kinds of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean they're mostly used as latrines.</v>

1085
01:03:27.211 --> 01:03:28.800
<v Speaker 6>If it's close enough to where you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>get to them.</v>

1086
01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:34.580
<v Speaker 6>The water is fed ID and horrible and </v>
<v Speaker 6>Greasy from the bloated bodies that </v>

1087
01:03:34.981 --> 01:03:39.840
<v Speaker 6>float in it and interestingly enough </v>
<v Speaker 6>poisonous because the gas that's used on</v>

1088
01:03:39.841 --> 01:03:44.841
<v Speaker 6>these battlefields,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know it's tempting to think of it as </v>

1089
01:03:44.841 --> 01:03:47.781
<v Speaker 6>vapor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's really almost a solid where </v>

1090
01:03:47.781 --> 01:03:51.051
<v Speaker 6>when a gas shell explodes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it covers an entire area with like a </v>

1091
01:03:51.051 --> 01:03:54.510
<v Speaker 6>pollen like coding and that pollen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Light coding is deadly,</v>

1092
01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:59.840
<v Speaker 6>so it's like putting insecticide on a </v>
<v Speaker 6>given area to keep you out of it for </v>

1093
01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:00.930
<v Speaker 6>awhile and eventually the rain will come</v>
<v Speaker 6>and dissolve that,</v>

1094
01:04:00.931 --> 01:04:05.931
<v Speaker 6>but the dissolve runoff goes into all </v>
<v Speaker 6>these shell holes that are filled with </v>

1095
01:04:05.931 --> 01:04:06.840
<v Speaker 6>water and makes them just poisonous.</v>

1096
01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:10.830
<v Speaker 6>There will be a writer who will talk </v>
<v Speaker 6>about how at first in in the spring,</v>

1097
01:04:10.831 --> 01:04:15.831
<v Speaker 6>the Verdun battlefield,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll try to recover a little of its </v>

1098
01:04:15.831 --> 01:04:18.111
<v Speaker 6>life and they will see little green </v>
<v Speaker 6>shoots pop up for a minute before the </v>

1099
01:04:18.111 --> 01:04:20.970
<v Speaker 6>poisonous air and soil and water and </v>
<v Speaker 6>everything just kills them right away.</v>

1100
01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:26.270
<v Speaker 6>It's a giant burnt out insecticide zone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what Verdun is and and the,</v>

1101
01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:32.731
<v Speaker 6>the landscape itself is horrifying to a </v>
<v Speaker 6>degree that's hard to describe unless </v>

1102
01:04:33.121 --> 01:04:38.121
<v Speaker 6>you want to say that this is more door.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is Jrr tolkien's conception of the </v>

1103
01:04:41.071 --> 01:04:42.270
<v Speaker 6>dark land.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1104
01:04:42.271 --> 01:04:45.060
<v Speaker 6>he was in the first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe he got it from there.</v>

1105
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.660
<v Speaker 6>The match is perfect though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean once they start to.</v>

1106
01:04:47.661 --> 01:04:52.661
<v Speaker 6>Hillary has been going for not even that</v>
<v Speaker 6>long at this levels of intensity you </v>

1107
01:04:52.661 --> 01:04:56.721
<v Speaker 6>have around you on this battlefield and </v>
<v Speaker 6>we talked about stage and all the people</v>

1108
01:04:57.301 --> 01:05:00.150
<v Speaker 6>merely players will look at this stage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These people are playing on,</v>

1109
01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.100
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very shortly into the battle.</v>

1110
01:05:02.101 --> 01:05:04.410
<v Speaker 6>It's a lunar landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the moon.</v>

1111
01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:09.740
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And these trenches are places where </v>

1112
01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.921
<v Speaker 6>people meet their end very often.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean lots of stories about soldiers </v>

1113
01:05:12.921 --> 01:05:13.740
<v Speaker 6>with big heavy packs in the night,</v>
<v Speaker 6>losing their way,</v>

1114
01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:18.090
<v Speaker 6>falling into one of these terrible </v>
<v Speaker 6>craters and just</v>

1115
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:23.100
<v Speaker 1>drowning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worst stories are these people who </v>

1116
01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:23.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear stories by people drinking,</v>

1117
01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:27.990
<v Speaker 1>kneeling down and drinking out of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>green colored poisonous waters with </v>

1118
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:30.370
<v Speaker 1>bodies floating in it because the water </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't making it up to the front.</v>

1119
01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:35.640
<v Speaker 1>The people whose job it is to bring food</v>
<v Speaker 1>and water to the people on the front </v>

1120
01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.070
<v Speaker 1>edge of the meat grinder are getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed,</v>

1121
01:05:36.071 --> 01:05:39.580
<v Speaker 1>trying to bring it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a terrible battle.</v>

1122
01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:43.660
<v Speaker 1>It's the battle of 1915 taken to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next level,</v>

1123
01:05:43.661 --> 01:05:45.190
<v Speaker 1>which is what this war is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1124
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Every time the world thinks they've come</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the limits of their endurance,</v>

1125
01:05:48.581 --> 01:05:50.740
<v Speaker 1>surely this is the worst battle there </v>
<v Speaker 1>will ever be.</v>

1126
01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:55.600
<v Speaker 1>The standard gets up again and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens continually.</v>

1127
01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:02.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a pressure cooker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's who's going to break first and you </v>

1128
01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:06.471
<v Speaker 1>know you thought last year was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to next year and while next year</v>

1129
01:06:07.231 --> 01:06:11.980
<v Speaker 1>is deadlier and while the scale is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps unsustainably titanic,</v>

1130
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:17.910
<v Speaker 1>the pattern is unfortunately for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>troops on the ground horrifically </v>

1131
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:20.590
<v Speaker 1>familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a week into the assault,</v>

1132
01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.530
<v Speaker 1>the German attack at Verdun stalls.</v>

1133
01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Just like all these other battles we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen in a lot more,</v>

1134
01:06:28.931 --> 01:06:33.931
<v Speaker 1>we will see the initial assault is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most tense nail biting up in the air </v>

1135
01:06:33.931 --> 01:06:36.010
<v Speaker 1>kind of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once it stopped,</v>

1136
01:06:36.011 --> 01:06:38.440
<v Speaker 1>there may be ebbs and flows and scary </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments,</v>

1137
01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:43.740
<v Speaker 1>but by and large we have descended into </v>
<v Speaker 1>what Churchill call did he say prolonged</v>

1138
01:06:43.751 --> 01:06:48.751
<v Speaker 1>operations or extended operations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're now into combat and for the troops</v>

1139
01:06:49.901 --> 01:06:53.890
<v Speaker 1>on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the most horrifying environment.</v>

1140
01:06:53.891 --> 01:06:58.120
<v Speaker 1>When we want to study the idea of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings can do,</v>

1141
01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:00.950
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me you want to see them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the most.</v>

1142
01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:02.980
<v Speaker 1>If you want to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like a product test,</v>

1143
01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:06.160
<v Speaker 1>did you want to put it under the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme stress and see how it behaves.</v>

1144
01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Look at what Verdun becomes over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next many months.</v>

1145
01:07:11.050 --> 01:07:13.960
<v Speaker 1>For the people on the ground who have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>live this.</v>

1146
01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.120
<v Speaker 1>How do they endure?</v>

1147
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:20.200
<v Speaker 1>And when you hear the stories from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

1148
01:07:20.201 --> 01:07:23.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean start with the approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>March the French,</v>

1149
01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:28.770
<v Speaker 1>as we've said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spend a lot of trouble to rotate their </v>

1150
01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:31.981
<v Speaker 1>troops in and out of this battle because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get worn down like a pencil and a </v>

1151
01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:33.370
<v Speaker 1>pencil sharpener,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to rotate them.</v>

1152
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:38.650
<v Speaker 1>When the soldiers approach Verdun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can see it along way away.</v>

1153
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:43.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean the guns of the opening barrage </v>
<v Speaker 1>were said to be audible a hundred miles </v>

1154
01:07:43.950 --> 01:07:45.480
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when they're approaching verdant,</v>

1155
01:07:45.481 --> 01:07:48.520
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a giant forest fire in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distance.</v>

1156
01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:54.690
<v Speaker 1>One French soldier on the way to it said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it reminded him of a gigantic forge</v>

1157
01:07:55.361 --> 01:08:00.361
<v Speaker 1>that ceased neither day or night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to quote it's the fires are more </v>

1158
01:08:00.361 --> 01:08:01.210
<v Speaker 1>door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

1159
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:06.870
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden the air becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>smokey and hazy and you don't see the </v>

1160
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:09.280
<v Speaker 1>sun clearly anymore and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetation disappears.</v>

1161
01:08:09.281 --> 01:08:14.281
<v Speaker 1>One artist said the only color in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape after a while because it's </v>

1162
01:08:14.281 --> 01:08:15.800
<v Speaker 1>just overturned dirt and bodies and and</v>

1163
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:19.520
<v Speaker 6>churned up concrete.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a hellish environment,</v>

1164
01:08:19.521 --> 01:08:24.521
<v Speaker 6>but there is a smear of red here or </v>
<v Speaker 6>there where the horses have just been </v>

1165
01:08:24.521 --> 01:08:25.880
<v Speaker 6>splattered by artillery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have I mentioned that?</v>

1166
01:08:25.881 --> 01:08:30.881
<v Speaker 6>It sounds like hell yet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We mentioned earlier how hard it was to </v>

1167
01:08:31.601 --> 01:08:34.360
<v Speaker 6>get food and water to the troops </v>
<v Speaker 6>fighting at the front line,</v>

1168
01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:38.410
<v Speaker 6>but it was hard to get anything to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>troops fighting at the front line,</v>

1169
01:08:38.411 --> 01:08:43.411
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to get new troops to the front line </v>

1170
01:08:43.411 --> 01:08:46.480
<v Speaker 6>could kill off half your troops in his </v>
<v Speaker 6>book the price of glory.</v>

1171
01:08:46.481 --> 01:08:47.200
<v Speaker 6>Alistair horn</v>

1172
01:08:48.810 --> 01:08:53.810
<v Speaker 6>takes a couple of different accounts and</v>
<v Speaker 6>puts them together and quotes a few </v>

1173
01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:57.950
<v Speaker 6>people who were there about what it was </v>
<v Speaker 6>like simply trying to get to the front </v>

1174
01:08:57.950 --> 01:09:00.480
<v Speaker 6>of the meat grinder at Verdun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Imagined suffering in a 40 or 50 percent</v>

1175
01:09:00.481 --> 01:09:03.030
<v Speaker 6>casualties trying to get to the meat </v>
<v Speaker 6>grinder.</v>

1176
01:09:03.031 --> 01:09:05.640
<v Speaker 6>Here's what he writes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm quote,</v>

1177
01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:11.450
<v Speaker 6>a mile or two from the front line.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Troops entered the first communication </v>

1178
01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:15.441
<v Speaker 6>trenches though to call them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This was generally both an exaggeration </v>

1179
01:09:15.441 --> 01:09:18.980
<v Speaker 6>and an anachronism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Parapets gradually grew lower and lower </v>

1180
01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:21.630
<v Speaker 6>until the trench became little deeper </v>
<v Speaker 6>than a roadside ditch.</v>

1181
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:26.990
<v Speaker 6>Shells now began to fall with increasing</v>
<v Speaker 6>regularity among closely packed men in </v>

1182
01:09:27.031 --> 01:09:28.530
<v Speaker 6>the darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>

1183
01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:33.531
<v Speaker 6>for obvious reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 6>approach marches were usually made at </v>

1184
01:09:33.531 --> 01:09:33.531
<v Speaker 6>night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The columns trampled over,</v>

1185
01:09:33.531 --> 01:09:35.310
<v Speaker 6>the howling wounded that lay under a </v>
<v Speaker 6>foot.</v>

1186
01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:40.700
<v Speaker 6>Suddenly the trench became nothing more </v>
<v Speaker 6>than a track hardly traced out amid the </v>

1187
01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:45.141
<v Speaker 6>shell holes in the mud,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which the shelling had now turned to a </v>

1188
01:09:45.141 --> 01:09:45.510
<v Speaker 6>consistency of sticky butter.</v>

1189
01:09:45.690 --> 01:09:50.690
<v Speaker 6>Troops stumbled and fell repeatedly </v>
<v Speaker 6>cursing in low undertones as if fearful </v>

1190
01:09:50.791 --> 01:09:54.300
<v Speaker 6>of being overheard by the enemy who </v>
<v Speaker 6>relentlessly pursued them with uh,</v>

1191
01:09:54.301 --> 01:09:59.301
<v Speaker 6>shells at every step.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes there were duck boards around </v>

1192
01:09:59.301 --> 01:10:01.560
<v Speaker 6>the lips of the huge shell craters,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but more often there were not,</v>

1193
01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:04.320
<v Speaker 6>and heavily laden men falling into the </v>
<v Speaker 6>water.</v>

1194
01:10:04.321 --> 01:10:07.110
<v Speaker 6>Filled holes remained there until they </v>
<v Speaker 6>drowned,</v>

1195
01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:12.240
<v Speaker 6>unable to crawl up the greasy sides.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If a comrade pause to lend a hand,</v>

1196
01:10:12.330 --> 01:10:17.330
<v Speaker 6>he writes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it often meant that too would drowned </v>

1197
01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:17.890
<v Speaker 6>instead of one in the chaos of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>battlefield.</v>

1198
01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:20.910
<v Speaker 6>We're all reference points had long </v>
<v Speaker 6>since been obliterated.</v>

1199
01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:25.320
<v Speaker 6>Relieving detachments often got lost and</v>
<v Speaker 6>wandered hopelessly all night,</v>

1200
01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:29.100
<v Speaker 6>only to be massacred by an enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Machine gunner is dawn betrayed them.</v>

1201
01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:34.340
<v Speaker 6>It was not unusual for reliefs to reach </v>
<v Speaker 6>the front line with only half the </v>

1202
01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:36.630
<v Speaker 6>numbers that set out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nor for this nightmare approach march to</v>

1203
01:10:36.631 --> 01:10:41.631
<v Speaker 6>last 10 hours or longer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And quote seems to me,</v>

1204
01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:47.520
<v Speaker 6>maybe I can speak for some of my </v>
<v Speaker 6>generation if I just spent 10 hours </v>

1205
01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:51.880
<v Speaker 6>struggling through that and lost half </v>
<v Speaker 6>our people while doing so.</v>

1206
01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:55.630
<v Speaker 6>Just so I got to take my turn on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>front lines.</v>

1207
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:58.750
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to be severely</v>

1208
01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:01.520
<v Speaker 6>these stabilized,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's put it that way.</v>

1209
01:11:01.521 --> 01:11:02.720
<v Speaker 6>Is that a good way to describe it?</v>

1210
01:11:04.230 --> 01:11:07.140
<v Speaker 6>And even though these French units will </v>
<v Speaker 6>be rotated,</v>

1211
01:11:07.141 --> 01:11:09.720
<v Speaker 6>maybe only spent five or six or seven </v>
<v Speaker 6>days up at the front,</v>

1212
01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.570
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was designed to keep them from just</v>

1213
01:11:12.571 --> 01:11:17.571
<v Speaker 6>being and being shattered.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But judging from some of the witness </v>

1214
01:11:17.571 --> 01:11:17.680
<v Speaker 6>accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1215
01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:22.950
<v Speaker 6>it didn't work very well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>British historian John Keegan delayed </v>

1216
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:26.790
<v Speaker 6>John Keegan a rights that a French </v>
<v Speaker 6>officer named Augustine coaching spent </v>

1217
01:11:27.421 --> 01:11:32.421
<v Speaker 6>from the ninth to the 14th of April on </v>
<v Speaker 6>one of these important hills and Keegan </v>

1218
01:11:32.491 --> 01:11:37.491
<v Speaker 6>rights quoting this officer quote,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the last two days soaked in icy mud </v>

1219
01:11:39.690 --> 01:11:43.350
<v Speaker 6>under terrible bombardment without any </v>
<v Speaker 6>shelter other than the narrowness of the</v>

1220
01:11:43.351 --> 01:11:46.080
<v Speaker 6>trench.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Bosch did not attack naturally.</v>

1221
01:11:46.081 --> 01:11:50.610
<v Speaker 6>It would have been too stupid result.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I arrived there with 175 men.</v>

1222
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:55.260
<v Speaker 6>I returned with 34 several half mad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not replying anymore.</v>

1223
01:11:55.261 --> 01:12:00.261
<v Speaker 6>When I spoke to them and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a French lieutenant described watching a</v>

1224
01:12:00.601 --> 01:12:05.601
<v Speaker 6>unit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his own unit actually coming down and </v>

1225
01:12:05.601 --> 01:12:06.870
<v Speaker 6>back from Verdun after being relieved </v>
<v Speaker 6>and he says,</v>

1226
01:12:06.871 --> 01:12:11.871
<v Speaker 6>quote first came the skeletons of </v>
<v Speaker 6>companies occasionally led by a wounded </v>

1227
01:12:12.181 --> 01:12:17.181
<v Speaker 6>officer leaning on a stick,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all marched or rather advanced in small </v>

1228
01:12:17.181 --> 01:12:20.250
<v Speaker 6>steps,</v>
<v Speaker 6>zigzagging as if intoxicated.</v>

1229
01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:24.210
<v Speaker 6>It was hard to tell the color of their </v>
<v Speaker 6>faces from that of their tunics.</v>

1230
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:27.090
<v Speaker 6>Mud had covered,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything dried off,</v>

1231
01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:29.520
<v Speaker 6>and then another layer had been </v>
<v Speaker 6>reapplied.</v>

1232
01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:34.880
<v Speaker 6>They said nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'd even lost the strength to </v>

1233
01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.491
<v Speaker 6>complain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It seemed as if these mute faces were </v>

1234
01:12:37.491 --> 01:12:37.491
<v Speaker 6>crying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something terrible,</v>

1235
01:12:37.491 --> 01:12:39.690
<v Speaker 6>the unbelievable horror of their </v>
<v Speaker 6>martyrdom.</v>

1236
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:43.080
<v Speaker 6>Some territorials who were standing near</v>
<v Speaker 6>me became pensive.</v>

1237
01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:45.570
<v Speaker 6>They had that air of sadness that comes </v>
<v Speaker 6>over.</v>

1238
01:12:45.571 --> 01:12:50.571
<v Speaker 6>One one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a funeral passes by and I overheard one </v>

1239
01:12:50.571 --> 01:12:53.871
<v Speaker 6>say it's no longer an army.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are corpses to have the </v>

1240
01:12:53.871 --> 01:12:57.990
<v Speaker 6>territorials wept in silence like women </v>
<v Speaker 6>and to quote,</v>

1241
01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:04.370
<v Speaker 6>so what's going on to those guys that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they go in one way and they come out so </v>

1242
01:13:05.251 --> 01:13:08.940
<v Speaker 6>shattered and sometimes it only takes a </v>
<v Speaker 6>couple of days to go from one reality to</v>

1243
01:13:08.941 --> 01:13:13.941
<v Speaker 6>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's where you know these firsthand </v>

1244
01:13:13.941 --> 01:13:15.240
<v Speaker 6>accounts from these people are so </v>
<v Speaker 6>moving.</v>

1245
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.360
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from the perspective of these men on the</v>

1246
01:13:18.361 --> 01:13:23.361
<v Speaker 6>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything seems so pointless because </v>

1247
01:13:23.361 --> 01:13:25.730
<v Speaker 6>they only know this little world of this</v>
<v Speaker 6>big battlefield they're operating on and</v>

1248
01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:29.970
<v Speaker 6>a perfect example is how you know these </v>
<v Speaker 6>generals were now fighting over the same</v>

1249
01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:35.150
<v Speaker 6>terrain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>features over and over and over month </v>

1250
01:13:35.150 --> 01:13:37.731
<v Speaker 6>after month after month.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They take them and then they're retaken </v>

1251
01:13:37.731 --> 01:13:40.240
<v Speaker 6>and then they take them again and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're all fighting over the same </v>

1252
01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:40.240
<v Speaker 6>carnage,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stained ground over and over again,</v>

1253
01:13:40.260 --> 01:13:41.560
<v Speaker 6>and they develop names.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1254
01:13:42.010 --> 01:13:43.560
<v Speaker 6>one of these hills is hill three.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1255
01:13:43.561 --> 01:13:48.561
<v Speaker 6>four becomes a famous hill with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 6>people paying with their lives to take </v>

1256
01:13:48.561 --> 01:13:53.451
<v Speaker 6>it and retake it again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's another one known as the dead </v>

1257
01:13:53.451 --> 01:13:55.440
<v Speaker 6>man or dead man's hills and other way to</v>
<v Speaker 6>translate it.</v>

1258
01:13:55.710 --> 01:13:57.560
<v Speaker 6>And that's another one of these hills.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1259
01:13:57.690 --> 01:14:01.110
<v Speaker 6>I mean they've had the tops blasted all </v>
<v Speaker 6>off them by both sides.</v>

1260
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:05.040
<v Speaker 6>Artillery there smoking like volcanoes </v>
<v Speaker 6>pretty much at all times.</v>

1261
01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:10.280
<v Speaker 6>We're told sort of a dual mount doom if </v>
<v Speaker 6>we want to keep our more door analogy </v>

1262
01:14:10.471 --> 01:14:15.040
<v Speaker 6>going.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when a unit retakes a position on,</v>

1263
01:14:15.041 --> 01:14:20.041
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of those long fought over terrain </v>

1264
01:14:20.041 --> 01:14:21.400
<v Speaker 6>features,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you have that around you.</v>

1265
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:22.960
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

1266
01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:27.970
<v Speaker 6>I'm in passing him has several quotes </v>
<v Speaker 6>where he talks about soldiers having to </v>

1267
01:14:28.961 --> 01:14:33.961
<v Speaker 6>retake this ground that are nothing more</v>
<v Speaker 6>than sort of open cemeteries combined </v>

1268
01:14:35.681 --> 01:14:37.390
<v Speaker 6>with butcher shops.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he writes,</v>

1269
01:14:37.391 --> 01:14:40.180
<v Speaker 6>quote on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 6>soldier and writers,</v>

1270
01:14:40.181 --> 01:14:43.240
<v Speaker 6>Jack Meyer describes the real </v>
<v Speaker 6>rightfulness when he noted,</v>

1271
01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:48.360
<v Speaker 6>quote everywhere there were distended </v>
<v Speaker 6>bodies that your feet sank into the </v>

1272
01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:53.281
<v Speaker 6>stench of death,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hung over the jumble of decaying corpse </v>

1273
01:14:53.281 --> 01:14:55.570
<v Speaker 6>is like some hellish perfume and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 6>passing him continues quote,</v>

1274
01:14:55.780 --> 01:14:57.520
<v Speaker 6>when the Germans captured hill three,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1275
01:14:57.521 --> 01:15:02.521
<v Speaker 6>four in May,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the first demands of the assault </v>

1276
01:15:02.521 --> 01:15:04.780
<v Speaker 6>troops was for a double ration of </v>
<v Speaker 6>tobacco to mask the overwhelming reek of</v>

1277
01:15:04.781 --> 01:15:08.540
<v Speaker 6>corpses routing around them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like Jacques Meyer,</v>

1278
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:11.470
<v Speaker 6>a fellow French soldier wrote at this </v>
<v Speaker 6>time that quote,</v>

1279
01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:16.740
<v Speaker 6>quoting this French soldier now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we all had on us the stench of dead </v>

1280
01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:17.740
<v Speaker 6>bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the bread we ate,</v>

1281
01:15:17.741 --> 01:15:22.741
<v Speaker 6>the stagnant water.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We drank everything we touched how to </v>

1282
01:15:22.741 --> 01:15:25.681
<v Speaker 6>rotten smell,</v>
<v Speaker 6>owing to the fact that the earth around </v>

1283
01:15:25.681 --> 01:15:26.740
<v Speaker 6>us was literally stuffed with corpses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And quote,</v>

1284
01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.980
<v Speaker 6>how do you not lose your mind?</v>

1285
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:37.030
<v Speaker 6>French barrel maker and Corporal Louis </v>
<v Speaker 6>Bartos arrives at the famous hill three,</v>

1286
01:15:38.001 --> 01:15:43.001
<v Speaker 6>oh four at one point in this bottle and </v>
<v Speaker 6>looks up and contemplates this piece of </v>

1287
01:15:44.331 --> 01:15:48.490
<v Speaker 6>ground that is cost.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So many people on both sides there,</v>

1288
01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.840
<v Speaker 6>earthly existence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He writes,</v>

1289
01:15:50.841 --> 01:15:55.841
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I looked out upon this famous nameless </v>

1290
01:15:55.841 --> 01:15:58.841
<v Speaker 6>hill,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our trench lay at the foot of it for </v>

1291
01:15:58.841 --> 01:16:01.391
<v Speaker 6>several months.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The hell had been disputed as if it had </v>

1292
01:16:01.391 --> 01:16:01.391
<v Speaker 6>diamond mines on it slopes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>alas,</v>

1293
01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:05.000
<v Speaker 6>all it contained now with thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 6>shredded pulverized corpses.</v>

1294
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:07.550
<v Speaker 6>Nothing distinguished it from </v>
<v Speaker 6>neighboring hills.</v>

1295
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:09.950
<v Speaker 6>It seemed to have been partly wooded at </v>
<v Speaker 6>one time,</v>

1296
01:16:09.951 --> 01:16:13.760
<v Speaker 6>but no trace of vegetation remained.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The convulsed overturned.</v>

1297
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:17.310
<v Speaker 6>Earth offered nothing but a spectacle of</v>
<v Speaker 6>devastation and quote.</v>

1298
01:16:19.050 --> 01:16:22.290
<v Speaker 6>Now eventually in for reasons that we'll</v>
<v Speaker 6>get into in a minute,</v>

1299
01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:27.380
<v Speaker 6>the situation changes at for Don and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>Germans go from essentially a sort of an</v>

1300
01:16:27.721 --> 01:16:32.721
<v Speaker 6>offensive position to a defensive one as</v>
<v Speaker 6>they transfer forces to another part of </v>

1301
01:16:33.421 --> 01:16:35.660
<v Speaker 6>their front for something else that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>going on,</v>

1302
01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:40.700
<v Speaker 6>taking their attention and so the French</v>
<v Speaker 6>use this as an opportunity to retake </v>

1303
01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:45.141
<v Speaker 6>ground and now we get the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>battles we had when the Germans were </v>

1304
01:16:45.141 --> 01:16:49.311
<v Speaker 6>moving forward in this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now that the French are and now the </v>

1305
01:16:49.311 --> 01:16:49.311
<v Speaker 6>Germans had taken a bunch of their </v>
<v Speaker 6>artillery away.</v>

1306
01:16:49.311 --> 01:16:54.040
<v Speaker 6>So now the French have the artillery </v>
<v Speaker 6>dominance and now the Germans get to </v>

1307
01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:55.410
<v Speaker 6>experience what the French experienced </v>
<v Speaker 6>on the other side and you know,</v>

1308
01:16:55.411 --> 01:17:00.411
<v Speaker 6>nine or 10 months into this battle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have human beings living on the edge </v>

1309
01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:03.540
<v Speaker 6>of what human beings can tolerate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's an extended,</v>

1310
01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:08.950
<v Speaker 6>a pair of quotes from the same guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a German soldier who is in of these </v>

1311
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:11.330
<v Speaker 6>faults and these faults.</v>

1312
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:13.370
<v Speaker 6>They're all over this area.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a fortified zone.</v>

1313
01:17:13.371 --> 01:17:18.371
<v Speaker 6>They have several Ford's covering one </v>
<v Speaker 6>another and a lot of the most terrible </v>

1314
01:17:18.371 --> 01:17:21.071
<v Speaker 6>battles happen over these forts and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're battered down so that they're </v>

1315
01:17:21.071 --> 01:17:25.361
<v Speaker 6>just shells of what they were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they could still hold hundreds of </v>

1316
01:17:25.361 --> 01:17:28.301
<v Speaker 6>men and protect them from shrapnel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So oftentimes you had tons of men in </v>

1317
01:17:28.301 --> 01:17:31.760
<v Speaker 6>these underground blown up forts with </v>
<v Speaker 6>blood everywhere and everything else.</v>

1318
01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:36.140
<v Speaker 6>And here's the way the environment is </v>
<v Speaker 6>described by this German soldier quote.</v>

1319
01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.020
<v Speaker 6>His name is private William Harmon's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>

1320
01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:42.620
<v Speaker 6>of the 67th infantry regiment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I get this from Peter Hart's book,</v>

1321
01:17:42.621 --> 01:17:44.450
<v Speaker 6>the Great War.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

1322
01:17:44.451 --> 01:17:49.451
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the entrance was a mere hole in the </v>

1323
01:17:49.451 --> 01:17:51.830
<v Speaker 6>scarred battlefield and the silhouettes </v>
<v Speaker 6>of cowering men constantly crawling into</v>

1324
01:17:51.831 --> 01:17:56.831
<v Speaker 6>rod looked like huge ants in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I descended an iron ladder some 40 feet </v>

1325
01:17:57.051 --> 01:17:58.640
<v Speaker 6>into the concrete cavern.</v>

1326
01:17:58.850 --> 01:18:02.390
<v Speaker 6>It was an enormous place,</v>
<v Speaker 6>crowded with many hundreds of soldiers.</v>

1327
01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:04.280
<v Speaker 6>Some lay on bunk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sleeping,</v>

1328
01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:09.400
<v Speaker 6>snoring and moaning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some cluttered the passages between the </v>

1329
01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:09.680
<v Speaker 6>bunks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>chatting or writing letters,</v>

1330
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:14.030
<v Speaker 6>other set or Nelton corners,</v>
<v Speaker 6>packing or unpacking their belongings.</v>

1331
01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:15.560
<v Speaker 6>Here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a flashlight there,</v>

1332
01:18:15.561 --> 01:18:20.561
<v Speaker 6>a candle match your cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dotted the dark with flickering islands </v>

1333
01:18:20.561 --> 01:18:24.251
<v Speaker 6>of light continually shifting and </v>
<v Speaker 6>brightness from this subterranean </v>

1334
01:18:24.251 --> 01:18:28.300
<v Speaker 6>stronghold.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A small patch of sky could be seen when </v>

1335
01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:31.661
<v Speaker 6>one stood close to the iron ladder or </v>
<v Speaker 6>look through the shaft which contained </v>

1336
01:18:31.661 --> 01:18:34.970
<v Speaker 6>the ventilator fans occurrent of warm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stale air from 40 feet beneath,</v>

1337
01:18:34.971 --> 01:18:38.750
<v Speaker 6>brought to my nostrils the sickening </v>
<v Speaker 6>smell of first aid medications.</v>

1338
01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:42.230
<v Speaker 6>Every one of the chicken wire births </v>
<v Speaker 6>were filled with mutilated,</v>

1339
01:18:42.231 --> 01:18:43.040
<v Speaker 6>muddy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>torn,</v>

1340
01:18:43.041 --> 01:18:45.710
<v Speaker 6>and befallen uniforms.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A dismal site.</v>

1341
01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:50.000
<v Speaker 6>There was a man with closed eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a blood soaked bandage around his head,</v>

1342
01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:52.520
<v Speaker 6>another beside him lay twisting in pain.</v>

1343
01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:55.730
<v Speaker 6>I saw some lights written.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Men who would scratch their bandages off</v>

1344
01:18:55.731 --> 01:19:00.731
<v Speaker 6>to ease the itching.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The passages between the bunks were </v>

1345
01:19:00.731 --> 01:19:03.521
<v Speaker 6>crowded.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There must have been a thousand men </v>

1346
01:19:03.521 --> 01:19:03.521
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some had been relieved,</v>

1347
01:19:03.521 --> 01:19:07.450
<v Speaker 6>but could not withdraw to the rear and </v>
<v Speaker 6>some who had come to relieve the others </v>

1348
01:19:07.450 --> 01:19:10.901
<v Speaker 6>could not proceed to the front lines.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All were imprisoned deep within the </v>

1349
01:19:10.901 --> 01:19:12.200
<v Speaker 6>concrete and rock entrails and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>quote.</v>

1350
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:18.490
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a scene that up until that point </v>

1351
01:19:18.490 --> 01:19:20.150
<v Speaker 6>could have happened in a lot of wars.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What happens next in that underground </v>

1352
01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:25.540
<v Speaker 6>environment that that soldiers writing </v>
<v Speaker 6>from is something that on a large scale </v>

1353
01:19:26.210 --> 01:19:29.420
<v Speaker 6>between great powers only happened in </v>
<v Speaker 6>this war.</v>

1354
01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:30.830
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>

1355
01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:34.070
<v Speaker 6>I heard the cry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>poison gas,</v>

1356
01:19:34.190 --> 01:19:36.710
<v Speaker 6>and I saw people around me putting on </v>
<v Speaker 6>their gas masks.</v>

1357
01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.740
<v Speaker 6>I adjusted mine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which still hung over my shoulder.</v>

1358
01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:43.730
<v Speaker 6>There it was a yellowish gas glimmering </v>
<v Speaker 6>near the iron ladder.</v>

1359
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:46.850
<v Speaker 6>A gas bomb must have been thrown into </v>
<v Speaker 6>the entrance shaft.</v>

1360
01:19:47.090 --> 01:19:52.090
<v Speaker 6>The CRI gas masks on electrified.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The whole shelter soldiers ran to get </v>

1361
01:19:52.431 --> 01:19:57.431
<v Speaker 6>their masks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which they had hung on the walls and in </v>

1362
01:19:57.431 --> 01:20:00.071
<v Speaker 6>the corners or laid on their packs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Many who had lost their is on the </v>

1363
01:20:00.071 --> 01:20:00.071
<v Speaker 6>battlefield,</v>
<v Speaker 6>began to cough,</v>

1364
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:05.350
<v Speaker 6>the wounded in the bunks tried to climb </v>
<v Speaker 6>into the upper births while beneath the </v>

1365
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 6>gas crept forward along its way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>extinguishing candle.</v>

1366
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:13.040
<v Speaker 1>After another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soon many were dying and the bunks and </v>

1367
01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.910
<v Speaker 1>floors were filled with bodies over </v>
<v Speaker 1>which the living stepped and stumbled in</v>

1368
01:20:14.911 --> 01:20:19.911
<v Speaker 1>search of air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The alarm surge like away from bunk to </v>

1369
01:20:19.911 --> 01:20:23.361
<v Speaker 1>bunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before long it had reached the farthest </v>

1370
01:20:23.361 --> 01:20:25.671
<v Speaker 1>man 100 yards away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The panic was so great that I saw badly </v>

1371
01:20:25.671 --> 01:20:29.511
<v Speaker 1>wounded men throw themselves onto the </v>
<v Speaker 1>floor as though they wanted to drink in </v>

1372
01:20:29.511 --> 01:20:31.800
<v Speaker 1>the gas while others tour the masks from</v>
<v Speaker 1>their neighbors faces.</v>

1373
01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Some had a reddish foam oozing from </v>
<v Speaker 1>their mouths and quote.</v>

1374
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:42.070
<v Speaker 1>I always try to remind myself when we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about these big grand battles </v>

1375
01:20:42.530 --> 01:20:46.400
<v Speaker 1>that what this really is is a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories like that.</v>

1376
01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:52.030
<v Speaker 1>The pain of that incident magnified over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire scope of the war.</v>

1377
01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:56.470
<v Speaker 1>And while I'm sure there's some people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are harder than I am in terms of,</v>

1378
01:20:56.730 --> 01:21:01.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that that's life and that's what </v>

1379
01:21:01.730 --> 01:21:01.730
<v Speaker 1>history is filled with and all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of things.</v>

1380
01:21:01.730 --> 01:21:04.890
<v Speaker 1>It's hard not to sit there and feel a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of all.</v>

1381
01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:10.220
<v Speaker 1>I think for the people who faced this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not out of any sort of patriotic,</v>

1382
01:21:11.881 --> 01:21:13.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glorification of war or anything else,</v>

1383
01:21:14.130 --> 01:21:19.130
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sort of the unexpectedly strong </v>

1384
01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:19.470
<v Speaker 1>limits of human endurance.</v>

1385
01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:24.810
<v Speaker 1>How did they sustain this effort?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did they,</v>

1386
01:21:24.811 --> 01:21:29.811
<v Speaker 1>when told they had to advance into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>or just not run away at top speed.</v>

1387
01:21:30.511 --> 01:21:35.511
<v Speaker 1>How did they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let's acknowledge that not all of </v>

1388
01:21:35.511 --> 01:21:38.271
<v Speaker 1>them did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were a lot of people shot in this </v>

1389
01:21:38.271 --> 01:21:42.750
<v Speaker 1>war for running away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the large majority of them did not.</v>

1390
01:21:42.751 --> 01:21:44.550
<v Speaker 1>And you sit there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did they not rebel?</v>

1391
01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:47.220
<v Speaker 1>How did they not revolt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would we do today?</v>

1392
01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:52.780
<v Speaker 1>There's a great quote from a f Scott </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fitzgerald novel.</v>

1393
01:21:53.050 --> 01:21:58.050
<v Speaker 1>It's fictional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he puts words into the mouth of a </v>

1394
01:21:58.050 --> 01:22:01.411
<v Speaker 1>man who showing one of these 1916 </v>
<v Speaker 1>battlefields to his compatriots there </v>

1395
01:22:01.901 --> 01:22:06.901
<v Speaker 1>touring the battlefield and he has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion with him and he tries to </v>

1396
01:22:06.901 --> 01:22:09.991
<v Speaker 1>explain to them the almost soup that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>required to bring up a generation of </v>

1397
01:22:14.201 --> 01:22:16.390
<v Speaker 1>people who could do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

1398
01:22:16.690 --> 01:22:20.350
<v Speaker 1>it's not just yours truly wondering how </v>
<v Speaker 1>people sustain this effort.</v>

1399
01:22:20.710 --> 01:22:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Even right after the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were trying to figure out how </v>

1400
01:22:25.710 --> 01:22:29.580
<v Speaker 1>people could do this and here's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>section from the f Scott Fitzgerald </v>

1401
01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:34.051
<v Speaker 1>novel where Fitzgerald character </v>
<v Speaker 1>explains it and he points in the </v>

1402
01:22:34.051 --> 01:22:36.710
<v Speaker 1>distance to a little body of water and </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

1403
01:22:36.711 --> 01:22:38.800
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see that little stream?</v>

1404
01:22:39.070 --> 01:22:44.070
<v Speaker 1>We could walk to it in two minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It took the British a month to walk to </v>

1405
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:46.120
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A whole empire walking very slowly,</v>

1406
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:51.390
<v Speaker 1>dying in front and pushing forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind and another empire walked very </v>

1407
01:22:51.461 --> 01:22:54.100
<v Speaker 1>slowly backward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few inches a day,</v>

1408
01:22:54.310 --> 01:22:56.980
<v Speaker 1>leaving the dead like a million bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>rugs.</v>

1409
01:22:57.250 --> 01:23:02.250
<v Speaker 1>No Europeans will ever do that again in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this generation and the other character </v>

1410
01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:02.920
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

1411
01:23:02.921 --> 01:23:06.430
<v Speaker 1>They've only just quit over in Turkey </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Morocco.</v>

1412
01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:10.270
<v Speaker 1>The response quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's different,</v>

1413
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:13.270
<v Speaker 6>this western front business couldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 6>done again,</v>

1414
01:23:13.330 --> 01:23:16.300
<v Speaker 6>not for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The young men think they could do it,</v>

1415
01:23:16.301 --> 01:23:19.390
<v Speaker 6>but they couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They could fight the first modern again,</v>

1416
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:24.510
<v Speaker 6>but not this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This took religion and years of plenty </v>

1417
01:23:24.510 --> 01:23:28.740
<v Speaker 6>and tremendous sureties and the exact </v>
<v Speaker 6>relation that existed between the </v>

1418
01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:32.881
<v Speaker 6>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Russians and Italians weren't good </v>

1419
01:23:32.881 --> 01:23:34.000
<v Speaker 6>on this front.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You had to have a whole sold sentimental</v>

1420
01:23:34.001 --> 01:23:36.520
<v Speaker 6>equipment going back further than you </v>
<v Speaker 6>could remember.</v>

1421
01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:41.760
<v Speaker 6>You had to remember Christmas and </v>
<v Speaker 6>postcards of the crown prince and his </v>

1422
01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:45.601
<v Speaker 6>fiance and little cafes and valance and </v>
<v Speaker 6>beer gardens and entertain Linden and </v>

1423
01:23:46.211 --> 01:23:50.830
<v Speaker 6>weddings at the Murray and going to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Derby and your grandfather's whiskers.</v>

1424
01:23:51.970 --> 01:23:55.060
<v Speaker 6>General grant invented this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>battle at Petersburg.</v>

1425
01:23:55.061 --> 01:24:00.061
<v Speaker 6>In 65 came the reply,</v>
<v Speaker 6>meaning general grant in the civil war </v>

1426
01:24:00.061 --> 01:24:00.061
<v Speaker 6>in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 6>65,</v>

1427
01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.170
<v Speaker 6>the main character says quote.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1428
01:24:02.171 --> 01:24:04.930
<v Speaker 6>he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He just invented mass butchery.</v>

1429
01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:10.140
<v Speaker 6>This kind of battle was invented by </v>
<v Speaker 6>Lewis Carroll and Jules Verne and </v>

1430
01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:14.701
<v Speaker 6>whoever wrote Ondine and country deacons</v>
<v Speaker 6>bowling and Marianne's in Marsay and </v>

1431
01:24:16.121 --> 01:24:19.320
<v Speaker 6>girls seduced in the back lanes of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Wittenberg and Westphalia.</v>

1432
01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:19.960
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

1433
01:24:20.290 --> 01:24:25.290
<v Speaker 1>This was a love battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a century of middleclass love </v>

1434
01:24:25.290 --> 01:24:28.991
<v Speaker 1>spent here and quote a century of middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>class love spent here that is profound </v>

1435
01:24:33.161 --> 01:24:35.960
<v Speaker 1>and that's how the generation that lived</v>
<v Speaker 1>through this war side,</v>

1436
01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:40.330
<v Speaker 1>so basically fitzgerald answer to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question of,</v>

1437
01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:45.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did these people endure is that you </v>

1438
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:48.541
<v Speaker 1>had to have grown up the way they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the same cultural influences and </v>

1439
01:24:48.541 --> 01:24:53.071
<v Speaker 1>expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including societal and class based ones </v>

1440
01:24:53.071 --> 01:24:54.430
<v Speaker 1>either had to have seen the world the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way they did,</v>

1441
01:24:54.431 --> 01:24:57.190
<v Speaker 1>had similar concepts of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1442
01:24:57.191 --> 01:25:02.191
<v Speaker 1>duty and expectations and even manhood </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'd have to have in some ways the </v>

1443
01:25:05.591 --> 01:25:10.591
<v Speaker 1>same illusions to because in certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances having illusions could </v>

1444
01:25:12.851 --> 01:25:17.851
<v Speaker 1>help you carry out military operations </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people who were more cynical and </v>

1445
01:25:18.881 --> 01:25:22.840
<v Speaker 1>realistic would never do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1446
01:25:22.841 --> 01:25:27.841
<v Speaker 1>when you think about the endurance to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's so normal to focus on the </v>

1447
01:25:27.841 --> 01:25:27.841
<v Speaker 1>horrific war side of this.</v>

1448
01:25:28.150 --> 01:25:33.150
<v Speaker 1>But the simple life part of this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes what pushes people over the </v>

1449
01:25:33.150 --> 01:25:33.280
<v Speaker 1>edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1450
01:25:33.281 --> 01:25:35.590
<v Speaker 1>you'll hear stories sometimes were they </v>
<v Speaker 1>will say,</v>

1451
01:25:35.591 --> 01:25:38.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were able to adapt to the shelling.</v>

1452
01:25:38.321 --> 01:25:40.300
<v Speaker 1>They just couldn't handle the rats or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1453
01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Something gets to them sometimes above </v>
<v Speaker 1>and beyond what you might think.</v>

1454
01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a perfect example is start looking at </v>

1455
01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:51.721
<v Speaker 1>what day to day life was like for these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who any of us would think we're </v>

1456
01:25:51.721 --> 01:25:56.281
<v Speaker 1>focused on staying alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it got down to even more </v>

1457
01:25:56.281 --> 01:26:00.120
<v Speaker 1>base level than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis Bartos fighting in the Verdun </v>

1458
01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:03.680
<v Speaker 1>inferno writes about at night being in </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of trenches.</v>

1459
01:26:03.681 --> 01:26:04.190
<v Speaker 1>When the rain</v>

1460
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:05.540
<v Speaker 6>just comes pouring down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he says,</v>

1461
01:26:05.541 --> 01:26:10.541
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we were crouching down so it's not to </v>

1462
01:26:10.541 --> 01:26:10.820
<v Speaker 6>catch a stray bullet or shell fragment </v>
<v Speaker 6>passing by,</v>

1463
01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:14.420
<v Speaker 6>and if this weren't bad enough,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a heavy rain started to fall.</v>

1464
01:26:14.630 --> 01:26:19.630
<v Speaker 6>It didn't take long for the water to </v>

1465
01:26:19.630 --> 01:26:23.261
<v Speaker 6>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Our helmets were transformed into drain </v>

1466
01:26:23.261 --> 01:26:26.111
<v Speaker 6>spouts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Little waterfalls ran down our packs </v>

1467
01:26:26.111 --> 01:26:26.480
<v Speaker 6>onto our hips,</v>
<v Speaker 6>off our shoulders and along our arms.</v>

1468
01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:29.780
<v Speaker 6>We didn't know what or whom we were </v>
<v Speaker 6>waiting for.</v>

1469
01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:34.930
<v Speaker 6>The night was pitch black where they </v>
<v Speaker 6>just going to leave us stuck in the </v>

1470
01:26:34.930 --> 01:26:34.930
<v Speaker 6>sewer</v>

1471
01:26:34.930 --> 01:26:35.320
<v Speaker 7>and quote.</v>

1472
01:26:36.850 --> 01:26:41.850
<v Speaker 6>Sewer is such an apt name too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>besides the bodies and the poison and </v>

1473
01:26:41.850 --> 01:26:45.070
<v Speaker 6>the decay and the lice and the rats have</v>
<v Speaker 6>not even dealt with them.</v>

1474
01:26:45.071 --> 01:26:48.430
<v Speaker 6>They're both absolutely beyond </v>
<v Speaker 6>imagination.</v>

1475
01:26:48.431 --> 01:26:49.960
<v Speaker 6>Living with the lions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>living with the rats.</v>

1476
01:26:50.290 --> 01:26:55.030
<v Speaker 6>You also have the problems of men </v>
<v Speaker 6>fighting in an inferno.</v>

1477
01:26:55.031 --> 01:27:00.031
<v Speaker 6>We're getting out of your trench meant a</v>
<v Speaker 6>pretty good chance of dying when you </v>

1478
01:27:00.031 --> 01:27:01.690
<v Speaker 6>have to go to the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Louis parked us writes quote,</v>

1479
01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:04.690
<v Speaker 6>and to make it worse,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as I've already described,</v>

1480
01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:06.470
<v Speaker 6>all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one after the other,</v>

1481
01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:09.280
<v Speaker 6>suffered from an epidemic of intestinal </v>
<v Speaker 6>disorders.</v>

1482
01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.680
<v Speaker 6>The resulting diarrhea sure cleaned us </v>
<v Speaker 6>out,</v>

1483
01:27:11.890 --> 01:27:16.890
<v Speaker 6>but in opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as soon as one of us got over at his </v>

1484
01:27:16.890 --> 01:27:19.681
<v Speaker 6>next door,</v>
<v Speaker 6>neighbor was afflicted with it and had </v>

1485
01:27:19.681 --> 01:27:20.650
<v Speaker 6>the bad luck to have to climb out of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>trench and head for the shell hole which</v>

1486
01:27:20.651 --> 01:27:22.570
<v Speaker 6>served as our latrine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of course,</v>

1487
01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:25.960
<v Speaker 6>we did this only in the last resort at </v>
<v Speaker 6>the last moment of agony,</v>

1488
01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:28.390
<v Speaker 6>stretching our guts until they were </v>
<v Speaker 6>about to burst.</v>

1489
01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:33.660
<v Speaker 6>One of us was surprised in the latrine </v>
<v Speaker 6>by one of these sudden fusel aids and </v>

1490
01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:37.561
<v Speaker 6>collapsed into his own excrement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So as not to expose oneself to similar </v>

1491
01:27:37.561 --> 01:27:40.780
<v Speaker 6>incidents,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some used sardine or monkey meat cans as</v>

1492
01:27:40.781 --> 01:27:42.910
<v Speaker 6>chamber pots,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it was not to have to leave.</v>

1493
01:27:42.911 --> 01:27:47.911
<v Speaker 6>One's hold in the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 6>won't even sacrificed his cast iron </v>

<v Speaker 7>How do you keep your sanity?</v>

1496
01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:55.490
<v Speaker 6>You have to risk your life to I'm in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>whole thing again.</v>

1497
01:27:55.491 --> 01:27:57.080
<v Speaker 6>Ellen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in Lincolnshire Battlefield,</v>

1498
01:27:57.081 --> 01:28:02.081
<v Speaker 6>there might've been one horrible day </v>
<v Speaker 6>where if you're unlucky enough to have </v>

1499
01:28:02.081 --> 01:28:03.110
<v Speaker 6>dysentery that day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a horrible day in the ranks.</v>

1500
01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:05.180
<v Speaker 6>It isn't a day after day after day </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

1501
01:28:05.181 --> 01:28:08.540
<v Speaker 6>These people are putting up with a </v>
<v Speaker 6>pounding on their psyche,</v>

1502
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:14.990
<v Speaker 6>but understanding what they went through</v>
<v Speaker 6>is in large part what makes this story </v>

1503
01:28:14.990 --> 01:28:18.890
<v Speaker 6>so incredibly compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The extremes of human experience,</v>

1504
01:28:18.891 --> 01:28:20.270
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I talk about it all the time.</v>

1505
01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:25.130
<v Speaker 6>There's a wonderful paragraph by </v>
<v Speaker 6>historian Eric Dorn,</v>

1506
01:28:25.131 --> 01:28:30.131
<v Speaker 6>Bros who tries to describe why this </v>
<v Speaker 6>isn't gratuitous to talk about this,</v>

1507
01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:35.920
<v Speaker 6>why it's part of being astounded by your</v>
<v Speaker 6>ancestors.</v>

1508
01:28:37.210 --> 01:28:37.620
<v Speaker 7>Here's what</v>

1509
01:28:37.810 --> 01:28:38.830
<v Speaker 6>Bros says,</v>

1510
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.590
<v Speaker 7>quote,</v>

1511
01:28:40.770 --> 01:28:45.770
<v Speaker 6>most historians today depart from the </v>
<v Speaker 6>traditional practice of omitting </v>

1512
01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:49.521
<v Speaker 6>casualty figures.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was once left out for respect of </v>

1513
01:28:49.521 --> 01:28:53.001
<v Speaker 6>the dead and to avoid any indecent hint </v>
<v Speaker 6>of criticizing or questioning the </v>

1514
01:28:53.001 --> 01:28:56.961
<v Speaker 6>sacrifices they made is now included in </v>
<v Speaker 6>order to eliminate the magnitude of the </v>

1515
01:28:56.961 --> 01:29:00.420
<v Speaker 6>horror men faced by citing numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In other words,</v>

1516
01:29:00.630 --> 01:29:05.630
<v Speaker 6>historians the process of turning back </v>
<v Speaker 6>towards describing what war was really </v>

1517
01:29:05.630 --> 01:29:10.131
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they do this despite the </v>

1518
01:29:10.131 --> 01:29:12.351
<v Speaker 6>understandable loading of the veterans </v>
<v Speaker 6>themselves to remember or speak about </v>

1519
01:29:12.351 --> 01:29:16.671
<v Speaker 6>traumatic experiences they have tried </v>
<v Speaker 6>usually unsuccessfully to suppress the </v>

1520
01:29:16.861 --> 01:29:19.380
<v Speaker 6>problems historians encounter with </v>
<v Speaker 6>casualty figures.</v>

1521
01:29:19.381 --> 01:29:24.381
<v Speaker 6>However,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially the astronomical numbers of </v>

1522
01:29:24.381 --> 01:29:27.201
<v Speaker 6>dead and wounded in 20th century wars is</v>
<v Speaker 6>that numbers have a numbing quality to </v>

1523
01:29:27.201 --> 01:29:29.160
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Although shocking to read initially,</v>

1524
01:29:29.370 --> 01:29:34.370
<v Speaker 6>they quickly lose descriptive </v>
<v Speaker 6>effectiveness as mines fail to grasp </v>

1525
01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:38.601
<v Speaker 6>horror in the abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in order to do historical justice to </v>

1526
01:29:38.601 --> 01:29:38.601
<v Speaker 6>combat on the ground.</v>

1527
01:29:38.601 --> 01:29:41.220
<v Speaker 6>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is necessary to go beyond the numbers</v>

1528
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:46.430
<v Speaker 6>to the gruesome eyewitness accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shaking off criticism that to go there </v>

1529
01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:50.811
<v Speaker 6>is gratuitous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Great War can only be fully </v>

1530
01:29:50.811 --> 01:29:50.811
<v Speaker 6>understood if all its aspects are </v>
<v Speaker 6>exposed.</v>

1531
01:29:51.090 --> 01:29:56.090
<v Speaker 6>Dimensions of the front experience that </v>
<v Speaker 6>not only affected soldiers' morale and </v>

1532
01:29:56.090 --> 01:30:00.501
<v Speaker 6>eventually the outcome of the war,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but also home fronts and they are </v>

1533
01:30:00.501 --> 01:30:02.340
<v Speaker 6>critically important to willingness to </v>
<v Speaker 6>continue shouldering the war effort.</v>

1534
01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:07.740
<v Speaker 6>All wars are horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bros writes tragedies for the dead,</v>

1535
01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:12.980
<v Speaker 6>their relatives and friends hobbling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sometimes disfiguring injuries for </v>

1536
01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:13.500
<v Speaker 6>others,</v>
<v Speaker 6>turning wives,</v>

1537
01:30:13.530 --> 01:30:18.530
<v Speaker 6>children and parents and the caregivers </v>
<v Speaker 6>for life and psychological mind fields </v>

1538
01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:20.490
<v Speaker 6>for veterans who may have escaped death </v>
<v Speaker 6>and injury,</v>

1539
01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:24.720
<v Speaker 6>but not the terrible memories with which</v>
<v Speaker 6>loved ones too are then forced to live.</v>

1540
01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:27.660
<v Speaker 6>The Great War was especially helacious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>However,</v>

1541
01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:32.840
<v Speaker 6>because it was the first to unleash the </v>
<v Speaker 6>full mechanized fury of sophisticated </v>

1542
01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:37.251
<v Speaker 6>industrial technology and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 6>men had never been asked to endure </v>

1543
01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:45.500
<v Speaker 6>anything quite like this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some of these French soldiers had to go </v>

1544
01:30:47.401 --> 01:30:51.030
<v Speaker 6>back to verdun more than one time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What does that do to you?</v>

1545
01:30:51.090 --> 01:30:56.090
<v Speaker 6>I read somewhere where one of them said </v>
<v Speaker 6>the first time you can kind of handle </v>

1546
01:30:56.090 --> 01:30:56.090
<v Speaker 6>because you don't know what you're in </v>
<v Speaker 6>for.</v>

1547
01:30:56.090 --> 01:30:59.871
<v Speaker 6>It's particularly hard when you're going</v>
<v Speaker 6>back to more door after you've been to </v>

1548
01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:02.961
<v Speaker 6>more door,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so happy to have survived and now you </v>

1549
01:31:02.961 --> 01:31:02.961
<v Speaker 6>get to take your chances all over again,</v>

1550
01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:09.360
<v Speaker 6>so the majority of the French army gets </v>
<v Speaker 6>a chance to rotate through this area at </v>

1551
01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:09.400
<v Speaker 6>least once and they never get over.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It.</v>

1552
01:31:10.210 --> 01:31:15.210
<v Speaker 6>Pattan himself will say about the Verdun</v>
<v Speaker 6>experienced to the French army quote,</v>

1553
01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:20.880
<v Speaker 6>the constant visions of death had </v>
<v Speaker 6>penetrated the French soldier with a </v>

1554
01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:23.590
<v Speaker 6>resignation that bordered on fatalism </v>
<v Speaker 6>and quote,</v>

1555
01:31:26.150 --> 01:31:30.650
<v Speaker 6>the fighting wind end for 10 months.</v>
<v Speaker 6>About half that time the Germans were on</v>

1556
01:31:30.651 --> 01:31:35.651
<v Speaker 6>the attack.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The other half the time the French were </v>

1557
01:31:35.651 --> 01:31:35.651
<v Speaker 6>on the attack and by the time it was </v>
<v Speaker 6>over,</v>

1558
01:31:35.651 --> 01:31:38.480
<v Speaker 6>this is disputed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but about a million total casualties.</v>

1559
01:31:38.481 --> 01:31:41.630
<v Speaker 6>Both sides added up together,</v>
<v Speaker 6>give or take 200,000.</v>

1560
01:31:41.631 --> 01:31:46.631
<v Speaker 6>Either way at the end of the war,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it will be mandated in the treaty that </v>

1561
01:31:49.041 --> 01:31:51.950
<v Speaker 6>win.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This battle field is cleared and it will</v>

1562
01:31:51.951 --> 01:31:55.100
<v Speaker 6>take decades just to get the bodies off </v>
<v Speaker 6>of it.</v>

1563
01:31:55.130 --> 01:31:59.560
<v Speaker 6>The shells are still there and many of </v>
<v Speaker 6>these areas are cordoned off until,</v>

1564
01:31:59.590 --> 01:32:00.220
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>probably</v>

1565
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:02.080
<v Speaker 1>a good 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 years from now.</v>

1566
01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:06.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm the treaty stipulated that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>French bodies were dug up and buried,</v>

1567
01:32:06.131 --> 01:32:10.540
<v Speaker 1>they needed to be buried singularly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>with white crosses for purity.</v>

1568
01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:16.050
<v Speaker 1>The Germans didn't have to be in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single grave and their graves were to </v>

1569
01:32:16.050 --> 01:32:20.851
<v Speaker 1>carry black crosses signifying shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The depth of emotion that Verdun created</v>

1570
01:32:26.461 --> 01:32:31.461
<v Speaker 1>in the immediate post war generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even in France today is unlike quite</v>

1571
01:32:31.770 --> 01:32:36.770
<v Speaker 1>any other military endevor French arms </v>
<v Speaker 1>have participated in</v>

1572
01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:44.320
<v Speaker 1>and the mythmaking about this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle starts before the fighting's even</v>

1573
01:32:44.321 --> 01:32:49.321
<v Speaker 1>done and there's a whole group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>revisionist historians who've been </v>

1574
01:32:49.321 --> 01:32:53.851
<v Speaker 1>trying ever since the battle happened to</v>
<v Speaker 1>poke holes in the myths that obscure the</v>

1575
01:32:54.191 --> 01:32:59.191
<v Speaker 1>reality of her done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got such a sacred hold on both </v>

1576
01:32:59.191 --> 01:33:01.390
<v Speaker 1>France and Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to separate the facts from the</v>

1577
01:33:01.391 --> 01:33:06.391
<v Speaker 1>fiction and there's a huge amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroism and sacrifice connected to this </v>

1578
01:33:06.391 --> 01:33:07.540
<v Speaker 1>event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's understandable that you would get,</v>

1579
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:13.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some mythmaking and the revisionist </v>

1580
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:14.200
<v Speaker 1>historians often portray Falcon high and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German commander.</v>

1581
01:33:14.201 --> 01:33:15.940
<v Speaker 1>And the one behind this plan as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>idiot,</v>

1582
01:33:16.980 --> 01:33:21.280
<v Speaker 1>it was dumb plan executed in competently</v>
<v Speaker 1>and after the war,</v>

1583
01:33:21.281 --> 01:33:22.690
<v Speaker 1>when people went to Falcon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heightened said,</v>

1584
01:33:22.691 --> 01:33:24.100
<v Speaker 1>what were you thinking there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1585
01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:25.600
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to kill a lot of people.</v>

1586
01:33:25.780 --> 01:33:30.780
<v Speaker 1>That was my goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mission accomplished a lot of these </v>

1587
01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:30.780
<v Speaker 1>revisionist historians.</v>

1588
01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:34.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm Paul Koski is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll say something like,</v>

1589
01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:38.950
<v Speaker 1>to make verdun out to be any worse than </v>
<v Speaker 1>any number of terrible world war one.</v>

1590
01:33:38.951 --> 01:33:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Battles is to play into the myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1591
01:33:40.541 --> 01:33:40.990
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1592
01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:45.820
<v Speaker 1>if being in a trench with the rain </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling on you with your feet up to your</v>

1593
01:33:45.821 --> 01:33:50.821
<v Speaker 1>knees in mud under shell fire and sniper</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire day after day is terrible.</v>

1594
01:33:51.371 --> 01:33:56.371
<v Speaker 1>While there's plenty of first world war </v>
<v Speaker 1>battles where as a soldier you would </v>

1595
01:33:56.371 --> 01:33:56.650
<v Speaker 1>have found yourself in that situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>with bodies all around.</v>

1596
01:33:56.651 --> 01:33:58.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's not that abnormal in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war.</v>

1597
01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:01.120
<v Speaker 1>And they're right about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1598
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:06.010
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's fairer to say that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>several really unbelievably horrible and</v>

1599
01:34:06.011 --> 01:34:09.850
<v Speaker 1>unprecedented battles in the first world</v>
<v Speaker 1>war that are equally hellacious.</v>

1600
01:34:09.851 --> 01:34:11.530
<v Speaker 1>And you would not want to be at any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1601
01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:16.660
<v Speaker 1>They each have their own awful unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>flavor to them that makes them different</v>

1602
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:19.180
<v Speaker 1>and nothing smells quite like for done.</v>

1603
01:34:19.570 --> 01:34:24.570
<v Speaker 1>And if you said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be at one of these horrible </v>

1604
01:34:24.570 --> 01:34:26.910
<v Speaker 1>battlefields for Dunn is the lowest on </v>
<v Speaker 1>my list for Dunn is the last place out </v>

1605
01:34:27.131 --> 01:34:31.780
<v Speaker 1>of all of them that I want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ask what Verdun achieved,</v>

1606
01:34:31.870 --> 01:34:36.870
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a wide variety of opinions on </v>

1607
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:40.651
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most popular is that it achieved </v>

1608
01:34:40.651 --> 01:34:43.021
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the broad symbols of the general </v>

1609
01:34:43.021 --> 01:34:46.741
<v Speaker 1>wastefulness of this war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a million people either are killed</v>

1610
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:52.590
<v Speaker 1>or wounded or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have never returned from that </v>

1611
01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:54.840
<v Speaker 1>battlefield and nothing of huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>importance.</v>

1612
01:34:54.850 --> 01:34:59.600
<v Speaker 1>It was gained because of that one thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that certainly did happen as it moved up</v>

1613
01:34:59.601 --> 01:35:04.601
<v Speaker 1>the timetable for several other battles </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to happen a little bit </v>

1614
01:35:04.601 --> 01:35:08.951
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when the French got pressed by the </v>

1615
01:35:08.951 --> 01:35:10.601
<v Speaker 1>Germans have ridden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said the British and they send to </v>

1616
01:35:10.601 --> 01:35:10.601
<v Speaker 1>the Russians.</v>

1617
01:35:10.601 --> 01:35:10.601
<v Speaker 1>You know those battles you were planning</v>
<v Speaker 1>on starting.</v>

1618
01:35:10.610 --> 01:35:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Could you move up the timetable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>start them sooner?</v>

1619
01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:16.910
<v Speaker 1>We could use the help over here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally,</v>

1620
01:35:17.630 --> 01:35:20.150
<v Speaker 1>the one thing in 1916 you're beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see,</v>

1621
01:35:20.151 --> 01:35:24.620
<v Speaker 1>and we've alluded to this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that these people have put up already</v>

1622
01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:28.610
<v Speaker 1>with a lot more pounding than we would </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably put up with today,</v>

1623
01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:32.930
<v Speaker 1>but there's a breaking point for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings in my mind.</v>

1624
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:38.350
<v Speaker 1>The breaking point that's coming was </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickened by the experience at Verdun </v>

1625
01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:44.440
<v Speaker 1>and we'd mentioned that the French had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>policy of rotating troops during the </v>

1626
01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:47.831
<v Speaker 1>battle to keep them fresh at Verdun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what that meant was virtually the </v>

1627
01:35:48.201 --> 01:35:50.570
<v Speaker 1>entire French army at one time or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

1628
01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:54.800
<v Speaker 1>was rotated through that sector for </v>
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>

1629
01:35:55.520 --> 01:36:00.520
<v Speaker 1>took the French and ratcheted up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>discontent levels in ways that were </v>

1630
01:36:01.251 --> 01:36:06.251
<v Speaker 1>probably out of proportion to what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have expected from a more normal </v>

1631
01:36:06.251 --> 01:36:06.251
<v Speaker 1>battle.</v>

1632
01:36:06.251 --> 01:36:10.000
<v Speaker 1>It got you closer to the breaking point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of pushing your adversary to </v>

1633
01:36:12.261 --> 01:36:17.261
<v Speaker 1>the point where their society literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>implodes is a thoroughly modern idea.</v>

1634
01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:23.440
<v Speaker 1>By 1916,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the military leaders in this </v>

1635
01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:26.120
<v Speaker 1>conflict see that as the end game in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this conflict.</v>

1636
01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:30.140
<v Speaker 1>The reason it's a thoroughly modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept isn't because people of the past</v>

1637
01:36:30.141 --> 01:36:35.141
<v Speaker 1>didn't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was because they could never take </v>

1638
01:36:35.141 --> 01:36:38.390
<v Speaker 1>enough damage to get to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we've said throughout this series,</v>

1639
01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:40.700
<v Speaker 1>nations in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>

1640
01:36:40.701 --> 01:36:45.701
<v Speaker 1>couldn't take a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones who could stand out like sore </v>

1641
01:36:45.701 --> 01:36:46.580
<v Speaker 1>thumbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Roman republic,</v>

1642
01:36:46.581 --> 01:36:49.040
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes it so unusual in the military</v>

1643
01:36:49.041 --> 01:36:54.041
<v Speaker 1>history sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could sustain defeat after defeat </v>

1644
01:36:54.041 --> 01:36:58.900
<v Speaker 1>after defeat and not capitulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could lose a battle of Kony.</v>

1645
01:36:59.301 --> 01:37:04.301
<v Speaker 1>They could lose a battle of Lake </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] in the same war and keep </v>

1646
01:37:04.301 --> 01:37:05.030
<v Speaker 1>coming back for more theory.</v>

1647
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1648
01:37:07.161 --> 01:37:11.420
<v Speaker 1>a generation before those defeats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexander the great defeats,</v>

1649
01:37:11.421 --> 01:37:14.960
<v Speaker 1>the massive and the greatest empire the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world has ever seen.</v>

1650
01:37:14.961 --> 01:37:17.660
<v Speaker 1>The Acumen did Persian empire with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of big shots.</v>

1651
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:21.830
<v Speaker 1>There's never enough time for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>society to implode.</v>

1652
01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:28.140
<v Speaker 1>A society collapsing at the foundation's</v>
<v Speaker 1>requires that they be able to stand </v>

1653
01:37:29.061 --> 01:37:31.700
<v Speaker 1>there and exchange enough punches to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that point.</v>

1654
01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:37.420
<v Speaker 1>By 1916,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grinding down of nations as well </v>

1655
01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:41.460
<v Speaker 1>underway as author David Fromkin says </v>
<v Speaker 1>the real war had become an economic and </v>

1656
01:37:42.591 --> 01:37:47.591
<v Speaker 1>social survival contest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the generals are beginning to </v>

1657
01:37:47.591 --> 01:37:51.170
<v Speaker 1>organize their strategies to quicken and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasten this outcome.</v>

1658
01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:56.620
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Falcon high and talks about you </v>

1659
01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:56.620
<v Speaker 1>know the idea using attrition</v>

1660
01:37:56.620 --> 01:38:00.060
<v Speaker 1>to bleed the French White,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he explains that you don't have to worry</v>

1661
01:38:00.061 --> 01:38:05.061
<v Speaker 1>about the Russians anymore because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're well on their way to having </v>

1662
01:38:05.061 --> 01:38:06.330
<v Speaker 1>their entire society collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1663
01:38:06.331 --> 01:38:08.790
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to all reports,</v>

1664
01:38:09.060 --> 01:38:13.950
<v Speaker 1>the domestic difficulties of the giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>empire are multiplying rapidly.</v>

1665
01:38:14.250 --> 01:38:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Even if we cannot perhaps expect a </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution in the grand style,</v>

1666
01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:22.820
<v Speaker 1>we're entitled to believe that Russia is</v>
<v Speaker 1>internal troubles will compel her to get</v>

1667
01:38:22.821 --> 01:38:26.340
<v Speaker 1>in within a relatively short period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this connection,</v>

1668
01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:30.240
<v Speaker 1>it may be taken for granted that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>will not revive her military reputation.</v>

1669
01:38:30.241 --> 01:38:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need not be anxious about that.</v>

1670
01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:39.080
<v Speaker 1>On the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is probable he writes that any such </v>

1671
01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:42.801
<v Speaker 1>attempt and the loss is it must involve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will only hasten the process of </v>

1672
01:38:42.801 --> 01:38:46.641
<v Speaker 1>disintegration and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should also point out that in the 19th</v>

1673
01:38:47.541 --> 01:38:48.500
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

1674
01:38:48.501 --> 01:38:52.070
<v Speaker 1>that kind of disintegration not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't the goal,</v>

1675
01:38:52.340 --> 01:38:57.340
<v Speaker 1>it would have been seen as a negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>byproduct in the era where a military </v>

1676
01:38:58.191 --> 01:39:03.191
<v Speaker 1>defeat meant that one general gave his </v>
<v Speaker 1>sword to the other general and we </v>

1677
01:39:03.191 --> 01:39:04.460
<v Speaker 1>exchanged some provinces are some </v>
<v Speaker 1>colonies or whatnot.</v>

1678
01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:07.490
<v Speaker 1>The goal wasn't for the society to </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapse.</v>

1679
01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.320
<v Speaker 1>It was now</v>

1680
01:39:11.490 --> 01:39:16.490
<v Speaker 1>and military leaders began to employ </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategies designed to make that outcome</v>

1681
01:39:16.861 --> 01:39:18.810
<v Speaker 1>a reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1682
01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:24.140
<v Speaker 1>when the war starts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British used their navy to clamp </v>

1683
01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:28.851
<v Speaker 1>down a blockade on Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the French don't look at that as a </v>

1684
01:39:28.951 --> 01:39:33.951
<v Speaker 1>very useful strategy because after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that's going to take a </v>

1685
01:39:33.951 --> 01:39:35.890
<v Speaker 1>long time and no one win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This war starts or you know,</v>

1686
01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:39.900
<v Speaker 1>a very small minority who turned out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be Cassandra's and prophetic.</v>

1687
01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:45.140
<v Speaker 1>No one thinks the war is going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>long enough for something like a </v>

1688
01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:47.850
<v Speaker 1>blockade to actually take effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by 1916,</v>

1689
01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:53.180
<v Speaker 1>everyone is starting to understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>those longterm anaconda like strangling </v>

1690
01:39:53.371 --> 01:39:58.371
<v Speaker 1>strategies are very viable and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British are not the only ones who can do</v>

1691
01:39:59.731 --> 01:40:01.710
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

1692
01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:06.750
<v Speaker 1>the Germans have a fleet to right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the point in the story where</v>

1693
01:40:06.751 --> 01:40:09.420
<v Speaker 1>it becomes worth talking about again for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a minute.</v>

1694
01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:14.310
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this German fleet was a key reason.</v>

1695
01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:16.240
<v Speaker 1>The tensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with Brittany,</v>

1696
01:40:16.241 --> 01:40:17.760
<v Speaker 1>increased in the prewar years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1697
01:40:17.761 --> 01:40:20.130
<v Speaker 1>It's called the Anglo German naval </v>
<v Speaker 1>tensions,</v>

1698
01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:25.640
<v Speaker 1>but it was considered to be worth it by </v>
<v Speaker 1>a kaiser and a government that thought </v>

1699
01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:27.720
<v Speaker 1>it was important to be able to hold your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own at sea.</v>

1700
01:40:27.721 --> 01:40:32.100
<v Speaker 1>So these ships were built and they cost </v>
<v Speaker 1>an amazing amount of money.</v>

1701
01:40:32.730 --> 01:40:35.970
<v Speaker 1>A huge amount of industrial capacity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucked up into this.</v>

1702
01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:37.120
<v Speaker 1>As we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

1703
01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:42.140
<v Speaker 1>You turn up at a basically friendly </v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain into an enemy and now that you </v>

1704
01:40:42.601 --> 01:40:47.601
<v Speaker 1>got what you wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sitting in port continually and </v>

1705
01:40:47.881 --> 01:40:50.930
<v Speaker 1>here you've got your country straining </v>
<v Speaker 1>every fiber you know,</v>

1706
01:40:51.130 --> 01:40:52.950
<v Speaker 1>to sacrifice for the war effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heck,</v>

1707
01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:57.960
<v Speaker 1>the civilians are starting to cut back </v>
<v Speaker 1>on their caloric intake and here's this </v>

1708
01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:01.171
<v Speaker 1>fleet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so expensive to build and every month </v>

1709
01:41:01.171 --> 01:41:01.270
<v Speaker 1>sucking up resources and sitting in </v>
<v Speaker 1>port.</v>

1710
01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:07.920
<v Speaker 1>This is the time in the story where </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Germans get a new admiral,</v>

1711
01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:13.680
<v Speaker 1>things start to happen on the surface </v>
<v Speaker 1>naval front for really the only time in </v>

1712
01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:13.690
<v Speaker 1>this war.</v>

1713
01:41:14.830 --> 01:41:17.620
<v Speaker 1>And if you are our nut for this period </v>
<v Speaker 1>like I am,</v>

1714
01:41:17.621 --> 01:41:22.621
<v Speaker 1>I like to call it the battleship era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere between 1890 ish in 1940 ish </v>

1715
01:41:23.351 --> 01:41:28.351
<v Speaker 1>about 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The era where you get these armored </v>

1716
01:41:28.351 --> 01:41:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Lavania fans that are just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

1717
01:41:29.141 --> 01:41:30.250
<v Speaker 1>they're fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1718
01:41:30.251 --> 01:41:35.251
<v Speaker 1>And they're such incredible vehicles </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you may have to fast forward this </v>

1719
01:41:35.251 --> 01:41:37.420
<v Speaker 1>show when I start going off on some </v>
<v Speaker 1>detailed tangent that,</v>

1720
01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:39.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only I find interesting.</v>

1721
01:41:39.730 --> 01:41:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1722
01:41:40.751 --> 01:41:45.751
<v Speaker 1>I think these vehicles are incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there is so little evidence of them </v>

1723
01:41:45.881 --> 01:41:49.900
<v Speaker 1>actually being used that on the few </v>
<v Speaker 1>occasions where it happens,</v>

1724
01:41:49.901 --> 01:41:53.320
<v Speaker 1>I tend to look at them rather deeply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only one occasion in history.</v>

1725
01:41:53.321 --> 01:41:56.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I count the Rusa Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>war pre dread.</v>

1726
01:41:56.411 --> 01:42:01.411
<v Speaker 1>I think only one occasion in history </v>
<v Speaker 1>where these armored ships from this era,</v>

1727
01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:06.780
<v Speaker 1>the 50 years battleship era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually fought the way these admirals </v>

1728
01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:10.390
<v Speaker 1>had envisioned they would in long lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles long lines,</v>

1729
01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:12.610
<v Speaker 1>stretching off to the horizon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1730
01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Lord Nelson Style pirates of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Caribbean style and facing a fleet.</v>

1731
01:42:16.930 --> 01:42:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Similarly arrayed and shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1732
01:42:18.971 --> 01:42:23.020
<v Speaker 1>in the distance between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That only happened once in this whole 50</v>

1733
01:42:23.021 --> 01:42:25.990
<v Speaker 1>year battleship era and only happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>once in this war.</v>

1734
01:42:25.991 --> 01:42:30.991
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's a battle in 1916 called </v>
<v Speaker 1>the battle of Jutland to Kooks like </v>

1735
01:42:31.391 --> 01:42:32.200
<v Speaker 1>yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Truly.</v>

1736
01:42:32.201 --> 01:42:34.660
<v Speaker 1>This is a fantastically interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter.</v>

1737
01:42:35.610 --> 01:42:37.570
<v Speaker 1>When we were thinking about organizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this story,</v>

1738
01:42:37.930 --> 01:42:38.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1739
01:42:38.271 --> 01:42:41.710
<v Speaker 1>you try to carve out places to take a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little direction,</v>

1740
01:42:41.711 --> 01:42:43.090
<v Speaker 1>change in a momentum change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1741
01:42:43.091 --> 01:42:48.091
<v Speaker 1>you go from the carnage of ridden and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those of you who know the story know </v>

1742
01:42:48.091 --> 01:42:51.661
<v Speaker 1>what's coming up in the future of it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take a little interlude to talk </v>

1743
01:42:51.661 --> 01:42:53.320
<v Speaker 1>about other elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just the naval side of this,</v>

1744
01:42:53.321 --> 01:42:58.321
<v Speaker 1>but also the fact that the navy really </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a wonderful canvas on which to </v>

1745
01:42:58.321 --> 01:43:01.801
<v Speaker 1>represent the technology of this era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how big of a deal that is to the </v>

1746
01:43:01.801 --> 01:43:03.970
<v Speaker 1>people here and that's a perpetual </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

1747
01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:04.510
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1748
01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Me going back in time and seeing what </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks to be ancient technology to US </v>

1749
01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:11.920
<v Speaker 1>looking at it the way the people back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then are looking at it,</v>

1750
01:43:11.921 --> 01:43:14.830
<v Speaker 1>to whom it's cutting edge stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1751
01:43:14.831 --> 01:43:17.260
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to think about the best way</v>

1752
01:43:17.261 --> 01:43:22.261
<v Speaker 1>to sort of explain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>create an analogy for how these people </v>

1753
01:43:22.261 --> 01:43:25.051
<v Speaker 1>see the fleets they have and the fleets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the navy's along with this new </v>

1754
01:43:25.051 --> 01:43:27.310
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These aircraft are the real cutting edge</v>

1755
01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:32.340
<v Speaker 1>technology out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why is because it's just </v>

1756
01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:34.360
<v Speaker 1>death to be too far behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I said,</v>

1757
01:43:34.361 --> 01:43:39.361
<v Speaker 1>the best navy from 1900 would lose to </v>
<v Speaker 1>several navies from 1914.</v>

1758
01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:45.300
<v Speaker 1>That's a mere 14 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think those 1914 navy's lose a </v>

1759
01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:45.970
<v Speaker 1>ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how quickly things are changing.</v>

1760
01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Robert Massey and his book dreadnought </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a great line where he says in 1900,</v>

1761
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:54.140
<v Speaker 1>and that's a mere 14 years before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war breaks out.</v>

1762
01:43:54.710 --> 01:43:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Every single British admiral commanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>a British battleship had been trained </v>

1763
01:44:00.290 --> 01:44:02.960
<v Speaker 1>when they came up in the navy and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>age of sail.</v>

1764
01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:06.790
<v Speaker 1>So that's an example of how cutting edge</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

1765
01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want a mental image,</v>

1766
01:44:09.131 --> 01:44:14.131
<v Speaker 1>think of the titanic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ship that struck the iceberg and </v>

1767
01:44:14.131 --> 01:44:14.131
<v Speaker 1>went down and everything that's from </v>
<v Speaker 1>this era.</v>

1768
01:44:14.131 --> 01:44:17.740
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a steam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>punky Sherlock Holmes.</v>

1769
01:44:17.741 --> 01:44:20.830
<v Speaker 1>He kind of feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think about it as.</v>

1770
01:44:20.831 --> 01:44:22.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are up in the command center,</v>

1771
01:44:22.661 --> 01:44:27.661
<v Speaker 1>one of these battleships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like star trek meets Sherlock </v>

1772
01:44:27.661 --> 01:44:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Holmes or steam punk and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of having a digital display,</v>

1773
01:44:30.251 --> 01:44:35.050
<v Speaker 1>you'd have one of those in around dials </v>
<v Speaker 1>with one of those arrows that looks like</v>

1774
01:44:35.051 --> 01:44:40.051
<v Speaker 1>the elevator Arrow in a nice New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>hotel that goes around on a gold </v>

1775
01:44:40.051 --> 01:44:40.051
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1776
01:44:40.051 --> 01:44:40.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1777
01:44:40.990 --> 01:44:42.250
<v Speaker 1>very beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

1778
01:44:42.251 --> 01:44:44.500
<v Speaker 1>These ships were beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>polished wood,</v>

1779
01:44:44.501 --> 01:44:49.501
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just gorgeous and they were </v>

1780
01:44:49.501 --> 01:44:49.501
<v Speaker 1>the cutting edge technology of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1781
01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:55.200
<v Speaker 1>And I had to resist comparing them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>space ships as a way to try to have us </v>

1782
01:44:56.651 --> 01:44:59.200
<v Speaker 1>feel like the people back then felt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know me,</v>

1783
01:44:59.201 --> 01:45:01.630
<v Speaker 1>that would just be so meta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's just like a star ship,</v>

1784
01:45:02.050 --> 01:45:04.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's a little like one but not </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough for the comparison.</v>

1785
01:45:04.661 --> 01:45:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I thought to myself,</v>

1786
01:45:05.741 --> 01:45:06.400
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1787
01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:08.520
<v Speaker 1>those people saw battleships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1788
01:45:08.530 --> 01:45:09.520
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as really cutting edge,</v>

1789
01:45:09.521 --> 01:45:14.521
<v Speaker 1>but not as much as we would spaceships </v>
<v Speaker 1>with an equal number of crew members on </v>

1790
01:45:14.521 --> 01:45:15.550
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a bigger deal.</v>

1791
01:45:15.551 --> 01:45:18.610
<v Speaker 1>But then I remembered the submarines</v>

1792
01:45:19.820 --> 01:45:20.870
<v Speaker 1>for the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1793
01:45:20.871 --> 01:45:24.440
<v Speaker 1>hard for us to get all wild about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to the people back then,</v>

1794
01:45:24.650 --> 01:45:29.650
<v Speaker 1>that is science fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very definition of the word right </v>

1795
01:45:29.650 --> 01:45:29.650
<v Speaker 1>out of Jules Verne's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,000</v>

1796
01:45:29.650 --> 01:45:33.370
<v Speaker 1>leagues under the sea and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden we have ships that go underwater.</v>

1797
01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:38.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like they have cloaking devices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They become invisible and worse,</v>

1798
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:43.990
<v Speaker 1>if you're a naval official back then is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they now carry new weapons that </v>

1799
01:45:45.441 --> 01:45:50.441
<v Speaker 1>threatened everything you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what really accounts for the </v>

1800
01:45:50.691 --> 01:45:53.870
<v Speaker 1>cautious nature of naval warfare in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>

1801
01:45:53.871 --> 01:45:58.871
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't the ships just all come out </v>

1802
01:45:58.871 --> 01:45:58.871
<v Speaker 1>blazing and everything while there's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these uncertainties?</v>

1803
01:45:59.660 --> 01:46:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Part of this period's attraction is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you begin to see a show down in naval </v>

1804
01:46:04.660 --> 01:46:08.540
<v Speaker 1>warfare when you haven't had any test of</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of this technology to long time.</v>

1805
01:46:08.541 --> 01:46:13.541
<v Speaker 1>No one knows what's going to happen when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get whole fleets out here blazing </v>

1806
01:46:13.541 --> 01:46:15.650
<v Speaker 1>away with this modern technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't happened before.</v>

1807
01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:20.950
<v Speaker 1>One of the things everyone's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scared about is you know these torpedoes</v>

1808
01:46:20.951 --> 01:46:22.540
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these minds,</v>

1809
01:46:22.541 --> 01:46:27.541
<v Speaker 1>you know these floating minds that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>lay in the water and then a ship runs </v>

1810
01:46:27.541 --> 01:46:30.541
<v Speaker 1>into them and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they explode because these weapons are </v>

1811
01:46:30.541 --> 01:46:30.541
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very cheap,</v>

1812
01:46:30.541 --> 01:46:35.011
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make a lot of them and they can </v>

1813
01:46:35.011 --> 01:46:36.570
<v Speaker 1>sync these massively expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1814
01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:41.200
<v Speaker 1>ships that take years to build and who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost as catastrophic.</v>

1815
01:46:41.470 --> 01:46:42.580
<v Speaker 1>They can sync those.</v>

1816
01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:45.980
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge change because in most </v>
<v Speaker 1>naval warfare,</v>

1817
01:46:46.250 --> 01:46:51.250
<v Speaker 1>generally there are exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you want to sync a expensive </v>

1818
01:46:51.250 --> 01:46:55.580
<v Speaker 1>first class ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you generally need either another </v>

1819
01:46:55.580 --> 01:46:57.150
<v Speaker 1>massive firstclass ship or a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other ones.</v>

1820
01:46:57.810 --> 01:46:59.940
<v Speaker 1>They have huge survival strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1821
01:46:59.941 --> 01:47:04.941
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can justify their cost and the </v>

1822
01:47:04.941 --> 01:47:04.941
<v Speaker 1>investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now all of a sudden,</v>

1823
01:47:04.941 --> 01:47:09.320
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill talks about the British </v>

1824
01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:09.320
<v Speaker 1>admiralty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just being petrified that you would turn</v>

1825
01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:14.181
<v Speaker 1>around one day and these great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge expensive ships that took forever </v>

1826
01:47:14.181 --> 01:47:17.451
<v Speaker 1>to build and that you only had a limited</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of were just disappearing in the </v>

1827
01:47:17.451 --> 01:47:17.451
<v Speaker 1>blink of an eye boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick explosion,</v>

1828
01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:21.210
<v Speaker 1>another ship gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when the war starts in like the</v>

1829
01:47:21.211 --> 01:47:24.990
<v Speaker 1>first couple of months that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lose a super dreadnought.</v>

1830
01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:30.140
<v Speaker 1>The Creme de la creme of the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>battleship forces or the HMS audacious </v>

1831
01:47:30.811 --> 01:47:32.550
<v Speaker 1>strikes a mine like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1832
01:47:32.551 --> 01:47:34.560
<v Speaker 1>a month or two after the war starts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1833
01:47:34.590 --> 01:47:36.240
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty brand new ship almost.</v>

1834
01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:37.530
<v Speaker 1>And Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes down.</v>

1835
01:47:37.531 --> 01:47:39.090
<v Speaker 1>One mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one battleship.</v>

1836
01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1837
01:47:40.981 --> 01:47:42.270
<v Speaker 1>if you're in the admiralty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going,</v>

1838
01:47:42.271 --> 01:47:43.440
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does this mean?</v>

1839
01:47:44.010 --> 01:47:48.050
<v Speaker 1>And then a submarine like sinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of old British cruisers,</v>

1840
01:47:48.090 --> 01:47:48.450
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

1841
01:47:48.451 --> 01:47:50.010
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean one right after another,</v>

1842
01:47:50.250 --> 01:47:55.250
<v Speaker 1>and now all of a sudden you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people who've got these big </v>

1843
01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:58.521
<v Speaker 1>expensive ships are petrified about </v>
<v Speaker 1>using them in military history as like </v>

1844
01:47:58.521 --> 01:47:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Martin van [inaudible] have spoken about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1845
01:47:59.851 --> 01:48:04.851
<v Speaker 1>We just have this strange dichotomy </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you spend so much money on these </v>

1846
01:48:04.851 --> 01:48:06.490
<v Speaker 1>vessels because they are very important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

1847
01:48:06.491 --> 01:48:08.820
<v Speaker 1>because you spend so much money on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to reach them.</v>

1848
01:48:08.970 --> 01:48:13.970
<v Speaker 1>And so you have the German navy in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British navy dealing with each other as </v>

1849
01:48:14.101 --> 01:48:17.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe two snipers hunting each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>would deal with each other,</v>

1850
01:48:17.670 --> 01:48:20.010
<v Speaker 1>waiting for the other side to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake.</v>

1851
01:48:20.011 --> 01:48:23.370
<v Speaker 1>And then when they do pouncing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is,</v>

1852
01:48:23.371 --> 01:48:28.080
<v Speaker 1>is that when the war starts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British clamp down that blockade and</v>

1853
01:48:28.081 --> 01:48:29.580
<v Speaker 1>that's all they need to do.</v>

1854
01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:32.730
<v Speaker 1>The pressures on the Germans to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about it.</v>

1855
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:34.980
<v Speaker 1>And as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Winston Churchill,</v>

1856
01:48:34.981 --> 01:48:36.450
<v Speaker 1>who was the civilian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1857
01:48:36.690 --> 01:48:40.140
<v Speaker 1>head of the navy for awhile in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict wrote down that really,</v>

1858
01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:42.990
<v Speaker 1>while there would've been a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantages to sending the,</v>

1859
01:48:43.050 --> 01:48:45.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>numerically superior British fleet to go</v>

1860
01:48:45.301 --> 01:48:50.301
<v Speaker 1>in there and just kick German tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The downside if you failed to do that </v>

1861
01:48:51.390 --> 01:48:53.370
<v Speaker 1>was so bad it wasn't worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1862
01:48:53.371 --> 01:48:53.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1863
01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:56.970
<v Speaker 1>we could get all these good things if we</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisively defeated the German.</v>

1864
01:48:56.971 --> 01:48:58.620
<v Speaker 1>But he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we lost,</v>

1865
01:48:58.650 --> 01:49:02.770
<v Speaker 1>and remember this is all untried </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology and naval combat,</v>

1866
01:49:02.771 --> 01:49:04.560
<v Speaker 1>it's weird and unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

1867
01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:09.830
<v Speaker 1>you could bring the superior fleet in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and somehow lose or just lose </v>

1868
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:12.720
<v Speaker 1>enough so that you don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>numerical advantage anymore.</v>

1869
01:49:12.721 --> 01:49:15.300
<v Speaker 1>You've got parody with the enemy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was unthinkable,</v>

1870
01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:19.020
<v Speaker 1>and Churchill said the chances of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening might not be great,</v>

1871
01:49:19.021 --> 01:49:21.450
<v Speaker 1>but if it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could cost us the whole war.</v>

1872
01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:24.570
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading that and thinking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

1873
01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:29.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a whole lot of interesting thoughts </v>

1874
01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:32.250
<v Speaker 1>come to mind if you believe what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill says about it.</v>

1875
01:49:32.670 --> 01:49:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Basically having the potential to end </v>
<v Speaker 1>the war.</v>

1876
01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how he explained it in his book,</v>

1877
01:49:36.901 --> 01:49:41.901
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the German navy were even to have a </v>

1878
01:49:41.901 --> 01:49:44.541
<v Speaker 1>nice victory against the British and cut</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the numerical superiority so that </v>

1879
01:49:44.541 --> 01:49:48.291
<v Speaker 1>they both have the same number of big </v>
<v Speaker 1>ships than the German navy would be to </v>

1880
01:49:48.291 --> 01:49:52.740
<v Speaker 1>interdict the stuff heading for Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Churchill says that that would </v>

1881
01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:55.360
<v Speaker 1>result in quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trade and food supply of the British</v>

1882
01:49:55.361 --> 01:50:00.361
<v Speaker 1>isles would have been paralyzed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our armies on the continent would have </v>

1883
01:50:00.361 --> 01:50:02.110
<v Speaker 1>been cut off from their base by superior</v>
<v Speaker 1>naval force.</v>

1884
01:50:02.350 --> 01:50:07.350
<v Speaker 1>All the transportation of the allies </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have been jeopardized and </v>

1885
01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:10.641
<v Speaker 1>hampered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States could not have </v>

1886
01:50:10.641 --> 01:50:10.641
<v Speaker 1>intervened in the war.</v>

1887
01:50:10.641 --> 01:50:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Starvation and invasion would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>descended upon the British.</v>

1888
01:50:12.281 --> 01:50:16.930
<v Speaker 1>People ruin under and final would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed the allied cause.</v>

1889
01:50:17.590 --> 01:50:21.370
<v Speaker 1>He says the great disparity of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>results at stake in a battle between the</v>

1890
01:50:21.371 --> 01:50:25.210
<v Speaker 1>British and German navy's can never be </v>
<v Speaker 1>excluded from our thoughts.</v>

1891
01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:31.500
<v Speaker 1>And so if you buy Churchill's theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means instead of being the most </v>

1892
01:50:32.051 --> 01:50:35.500
<v Speaker 1>secure of the great powers that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of us assume Britain is,</v>

1893
01:50:35.501 --> 01:50:37.890
<v Speaker 1>after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about an island nation to</v>

1894
01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:39.610
<v Speaker 1>country with a moat around it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1895
01:50:39.611 --> 01:50:41.170
<v Speaker 1>And then you add the greatest navy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

1896
01:50:41.171 --> 01:50:44.140
<v Speaker 1>Looks pretty secure to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Churchill's idea here is that,</v>

1897
01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:47.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're one lucky punch away from that</v>

1898
01:50:47.711 --> 01:50:52.711
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Changing to stay with our boxing </v>

1899
01:50:52.711 --> 01:50:52.780
<v Speaker 1>analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that's true,</v>

1900
01:50:53.290 --> 01:50:58.290
<v Speaker 1>the Germans maybe are justified in </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping that fleet safe and port in case</v>

1901
01:50:58.421 --> 01:50:59.800
<v Speaker 1>you need a lucky punch.</v>

1902
01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're losing the war elsewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you decide you'll send your ships on</v>

1903
01:51:04.121 --> 01:51:07.180
<v Speaker 1>a death run and take your chances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you get lucky,</v>

1904
01:51:07.181 --> 01:51:08.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you get a knockout blow.</v>

1905
01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:11.620
<v Speaker 1>If again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you buy into what Churchill saying,</v>

1906
01:51:11.621 --> 01:51:16.621
<v Speaker 1>it means that the Germans will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as they still have a fleet </v>

1907
01:51:16.621 --> 01:51:17.770
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain the ability to win the war with</v>

1908
01:51:17.771 --> 01:51:20.110
<v Speaker 1>a lucky punch at anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that fascinating.</v>

1909
01:51:20.111 --> 01:51:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Don't know if I believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but find it fascinating.</v>

1910
01:51:23.710 --> 01:51:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only time in this war that the </v>

1911
01:51:28.710 --> 01:51:30.970
<v Speaker 1>attempt at a lucky punch happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't thrown that way,</v>

1912
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:36.270
<v Speaker 1>but the only time that this decisive </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter that could be potentially </v>

1913
01:51:36.270 --> 01:51:38.680
<v Speaker 1>horrifying if it totally went the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>way for Britain.</v>

1914
01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:41.560
<v Speaker 1>The only time this happens is in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the story.</v>

1915
01:51:41.561 --> 01:51:44.170
<v Speaker 1>We're in now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1916,</v>

1916
01:51:44.230 --> 01:51:46.210
<v Speaker 1>and it happens because of that album we </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned earlier.</v>

1917
01:51:46.210 --> 01:51:51.210
<v Speaker 1>His name is Ryan Hart Shear and he takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>over in early 1916 and he feels about </v>

1918
01:51:51.311 --> 01:51:53.830
<v Speaker 1>the German fleet pretty much the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>way everyone else does.</v>

1919
01:51:54.250 --> 01:51:57.700
<v Speaker 1>It's time to earn your keep and let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>start acting more aggressively with it.</v>

1920
01:51:58.060 --> 01:51:59.920
<v Speaker 1>And so he'll start trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1921
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:02.410
<v Speaker 1>the best way to put it as trap the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British,</v>

1922
01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:05.950
<v Speaker 1>the British have more big ships than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>German.</v>

1923
01:52:05.951 --> 01:52:07.210
<v Speaker 1>So sheers ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1924
01:52:07.211 --> 01:52:10.750
<v Speaker 1>let's see if we can ambush small numbers</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those big ships,</v>

1925
01:52:11.110 --> 01:52:16.110
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed them and slowly but surely </v>
<v Speaker 1>widdled down the advantage in numbers </v>

1926
01:52:16.110 --> 01:52:20.221
<v Speaker 1>that the British have and it's one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these attempted traps that results in </v>

1927
01:52:20.891 --> 01:52:24.490
<v Speaker 1>this really only time for enthusiasts </v>
<v Speaker 1>like yours truly,</v>

1928
01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:29.880
<v Speaker 1>to see what these fleets could do in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>all out encounter with both sides,</v>

1929
01:52:31.630 --> 01:52:35.440
<v Speaker 1>hurling steel at the horizon and with </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these weapons that,</v>

1930
01:52:35.441 --> 01:52:37.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a spectator standpoint,</v>

1931
01:52:38.050 --> 01:52:40.960
<v Speaker 1>you're just dying to see what the heck </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can do.</v>

1932
01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:43.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's start with the guns.</v>

1933
01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:48.480
<v Speaker 1>The guns on these ships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same kind of guns you saw leveling </v>

1934
01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:49.760
<v Speaker 1>the Belgian fortune that the Germans </v>
<v Speaker 1>were using it for.</v>

1935
01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the big naval guns being used </v>

1936
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:54.830
<v Speaker 1>on land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1937
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:54.980
<v Speaker 1>why do you think they call them naval </v>
<v Speaker 1>guns?</v>

1938
01:52:54.981 --> 01:52:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These new battleships,</v>

1939
01:52:57.101 --> 01:53:00.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British are bringing in four or five</v>

1940
01:53:01.070 --> 01:53:06.070
<v Speaker 1>brand new ones that will fight in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Second World War Two that have 15 inch </v>

1941
01:53:06.070 --> 01:53:09.611
<v Speaker 1>guns and multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like eight to 1215 inch guns.</v>

1942
01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:12.110
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 inches of armor.</v>

1943
01:53:12.111 --> 01:53:14.120
<v Speaker 1>They were like 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>tons.</v>

1944
01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:16.100
<v Speaker 1>The new Queen Elizabeth Class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're called.</v>

1945
01:53:16.101 --> 01:53:19.130
<v Speaker 1>They can do like 25 knots if they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really smoking.</v>

1946
01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:25.540
<v Speaker 1>These are incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible modern warships and when you </v>

1947
01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:28.460
<v Speaker 1>realize that they can hurl a shell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>size of a small Volkswagen,</v>

1948
01:53:29.240 --> 01:53:34.240
<v Speaker 1>18 miles across the horizon at a target </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hundred feet wide while both </v>

1949
01:53:36.471 --> 01:53:41.471
<v Speaker 1>shooter and target are moving and hope </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hit it reasonably well.</v>

1950
01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:45.440
<v Speaker 1>That's shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Spanish American war,</v>

1951
01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:50.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less than 20 years before this time </v>

1952
01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:52.841
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would fire hundreds of shots at </v>

1953
01:53:52.841 --> 01:53:53.750
<v Speaker 1>about just less than three miles </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance.</v>

1954
01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:55.910
<v Speaker 1>And every now and then they'd score a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit,</v>

1955
01:53:55.940 --> 01:53:59.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds to get a few in the Russo,</v>

1956
01:53:59.451 --> 01:54:04.451
<v Speaker 1>Japanese war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they broke all records when they opened </v>

1957
01:54:04.451 --> 01:54:05.150
<v Speaker 1>fire at each other at eight miles </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance.</v>

1958
01:54:05.900 --> 01:54:08.840
<v Speaker 1>That's 11 years before the battle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jutland.</v>

1959
01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Eight miles breaking all records.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Battle of Jutland has ships that can</v>

1960
01:54:12.081 --> 01:54:17.081
<v Speaker 1>fire 18 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you even hit anything on the </v>

1961
01:54:17.081 --> 01:54:17.120
<v Speaker 1>horizon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1962
01:54:17.121 --> 01:54:19.580
<v Speaker 1>both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>British and German are incorporating,</v>

1963
01:54:19.581 --> 01:54:21.410
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like steam punk technology,</v>

1964
01:54:21.420 --> 01:54:26.420
<v Speaker 1>maybe a rudimentary fire control </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer you might call it and both </v>

1965
01:54:26.420 --> 01:54:30.911
<v Speaker 1>sides have different versions and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans have superior optics and so </v>

1966
01:54:30.911 --> 01:54:31.700
<v Speaker 1>they'll score the early hits in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1967
01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:36.760
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this encounter that happens in large </v>

1968
01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:39.671
<v Speaker 1>part because the British are reading the</v>
<v Speaker 1>naval communications of the Germans.</v>

1969
01:54:40.970 --> 01:54:45.970
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love the battle of Jutland for a </v>

1970
01:54:45.970 --> 01:54:48.370
<v Speaker 1>couple of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just because it's the battleship </v>

1971
01:54:48.370 --> 01:54:48.370
<v Speaker 1>encounter of the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because it's a rubber meets the</v>

1972
01:54:48.370 --> 01:54:53.201
<v Speaker 1>road moment a put up or shut up </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical acid test where all of the </v>

1973
01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:57.350
<v Speaker 1>military theories and the debates and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1974
01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:02.680
<v Speaker 1>the philosophical differences amongst </v>
<v Speaker 1>experts over the proper way to build </v>

1975
01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:06.731
<v Speaker 1>these ships and what naval battles going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like in the next war and all that </v>

1976
01:55:06.731 --> 01:55:09.020
<v Speaker 1>stuff leaves the realm of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretical and gets,</v>

1977
01:55:09.390 --> 01:55:14.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laboratory tested on the naval </v>

1978
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:16.430
<v Speaker 1>battlefield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The land powers already saw this happen </v>

1979
01:55:16.430 --> 01:55:19.541
<v Speaker 1>to them right at the start of the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their military land theories and all </v>

1980
01:55:19.541 --> 01:55:21.080
<v Speaker 1>that the people had speculated about for</v>
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>

1981
01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:25.880
<v Speaker 1>got their acid test in the first month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Places like the battles of the frontiers</v>

1982
01:55:25.881 --> 01:55:30.881
<v Speaker 1>where those sort of high minded all </v>
<v Speaker 1>academic debates at military war </v>

1983
01:55:30.881 --> 01:55:35.801
<v Speaker 1>colleges about whether or not charging </v>
<v Speaker 1>cavalry will have any sort of a role on </v>

1984
01:55:35.801 --> 01:55:37.040
<v Speaker 1>the modern battlefield with machine guns</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything.</v>

1985
01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:42.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean that kind of stuff gets tested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first month of the war and the </v>

1986
01:55:42.250 --> 01:55:43.620
<v Speaker 1>results are of course bloody and </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisive.</v>

1987
01:55:43.621 --> 01:55:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Even if they won't be absorbed right </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

1988
01:55:46.650 --> 01:55:49.530
<v Speaker 1>The naval side of this war hasn't had </v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of an acid test yet.</v>

1989
01:55:49.770 --> 01:55:54.770
<v Speaker 1>There've been little encounters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the Falkland Islands and other </v>

1990
01:55:54.770 --> 01:55:57.210
<v Speaker 1>one dog or bank between a few cruisers </v>
<v Speaker 1>here in a battle cruiser to there,</v>

1991
01:55:57.450 --> 01:55:59.640
<v Speaker 1>but nothing like what's going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Jutland.</v>

1992
01:56:00.090 --> 01:56:04.470
<v Speaker 1>And when you realize how careful these </v>
<v Speaker 1>admirals are being because of the nature</v>

1993
01:56:04.471 --> 01:56:09.471
<v Speaker 1>of naval combat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could provide an opportunity </v>

1994
01:56:09.471 --> 01:56:10.140
<v Speaker 1>for someone to get a lucky punch if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not careful.</v>

1995
01:56:10.141 --> 01:56:11.820
<v Speaker 1>So none of these admirals wants to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1996
01:56:11.970 --> 01:56:16.970
<v Speaker 1>unless they have an edge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless they have an advantage on their </v>

1997
01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:16.970
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>favorable conditions,</v>

1998
01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:21.171
<v Speaker 1>it would be called the British don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do anything because they've got </v>

1999
01:56:21.171 --> 01:56:21.990
<v Speaker 1>this blockade going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So worst case scenario,</v>

2000
01:56:21.991 --> 01:56:26.991
<v Speaker 1>if things just stay as they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are wearing the Germans down with </v>

2001
01:56:26.991 --> 01:56:26.991
<v Speaker 1>this blockade.</v>

2002
01:56:26.991 --> 01:56:31.640
<v Speaker 1>They're going to create the </v>
<v Speaker 1>disintegration of a state just like we </v>

2003
01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:32.210
<v Speaker 1>told you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2004
01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:34.230
<v Speaker 1>was the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now of these leaders,</v>

2005
01:56:34.231 --> 01:56:39.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the Germans begin to starve at home </v>

2006
01:56:39.231 --> 01:56:42.150
<v Speaker 1>and the caloric intake is already being </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduced for their civilians,</v>

2007
01:56:42.330 --> 01:56:47.330
<v Speaker 1>you will see revolution in the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this British strategy of blockade </v>

2008
01:56:47.330 --> 01:56:48.180
<v Speaker 1>will eventually bring Germany to its </v>
<v Speaker 1>knees.</v>

2009
01:56:48.510 --> 01:56:52.020
<v Speaker 1>So it's incumbent upon the Germans to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about that situation when they</v>

2010
01:56:52.021 --> 01:56:56.070
<v Speaker 1>get their new admiral Reinhardt's shear </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1916 who wants to be more aggressive?</v>

2011
01:56:56.250 --> 01:56:59.370
<v Speaker 1>He decides to create his own edge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2012
01:56:59.371 --> 01:57:03.570
<v Speaker 1>the conditions for his own advantage on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the naval battlefield.</v>

2013
01:57:03.810 --> 01:57:08.810
<v Speaker 1>So he sets traps and in late May 1916,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sets one for what he hopes will be a </v>

2014
01:57:09.991 --> 01:57:12.630
<v Speaker 1>detachment of big British warships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2015
01:57:12.631 --> 01:57:16.870
<v Speaker 1>get five or six battle cruisers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>entice them pastures,</v>

2016
01:57:16.871 --> 01:57:21.871
<v Speaker 1>submarines or into your mind fields or </v>
<v Speaker 1>into an area where they think they can </v>

2017
01:57:21.871 --> 01:57:26.481
<v Speaker 1>feast on some of your light forces and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then pounce on them with your big fleet </v>

2018
01:57:26.481 --> 01:57:27.720
<v Speaker 1>and that's what she plans to do.</v>

2019
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:32.990
<v Speaker 1>And so he sets out all these forces and </v>
<v Speaker 1>prepares this little ambush and what he </v>

2020
01:57:32.990 --> 01:57:35.670
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know is that the British,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said,</v>

2021
01:57:36.150 --> 01:57:38.520
<v Speaker 1>our reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these naval communications,</v>

2022
01:57:38.880 --> 01:57:43.880
<v Speaker 1>are the British the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>cryptographers on the planet or is that </v>

2023
01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:46.620
<v Speaker 1>just the 20th century?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of coloring my view because boy,</v>

2024
01:57:46.621 --> 01:57:48.630
<v Speaker 1>were they great in the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Second World War.</v>

2025
01:57:48.631 --> 01:57:52.350
<v Speaker 1>They will famously be reading all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>German enigma traffic among other things</v>

2026
01:57:52.650 --> 01:57:57.650
<v Speaker 1>in this war and the first couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>months the German naval codes fall into </v>

2027
01:57:57.650 --> 01:58:01.131
<v Speaker 1>their hands and while they may not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>deciphering every single message when </v>

2028
01:58:01.801 --> 01:58:06.801
<v Speaker 1>the entire German high seas fleet as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called 100 ships about decides to </v>

2029
01:58:07.621 --> 01:58:09.230
<v Speaker 1>way anchor and go out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2030
01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:12.180
<v Speaker 1>looking to play in the North Sea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British know about that.</v>

2031
01:58:12.181 --> 01:58:14.130
<v Speaker 1>There'll be big communication spikes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

2032
01:58:14.370 --> 01:58:16.590
<v Speaker 1>So when sheer decides to set this </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambush,</v>

2033
01:58:16.890 --> 01:58:19.260
<v Speaker 1>the British reading the naval codes tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fleet,</v>

2034
01:58:19.261 --> 01:58:19.710
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

2035
01:58:19.710 --> 01:58:24.060
<v Speaker 1>The Germans are out there and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that we know they're out there.</v>

2036
01:58:24.061 --> 01:58:25.980
<v Speaker 1>And so the British grand fleet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>

2037
01:58:25.981 --> 01:58:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we have the advantage.</v>

2038
01:58:27.391 --> 01:58:32.391
<v Speaker 1>We will trap the trappers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the British Grand Fleet,</v>

2039
01:58:32.431 --> 01:58:34.570
<v Speaker 1>which is like 28,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2040
01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:39.620
<v Speaker 1>super dreadnoughts and dreadnoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's the biggest fleet in the </v>

2041
01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:42.561
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the most powerful fleet in world </v>

2042
01:58:42.561 --> 01:58:43.180
<v Speaker 1>history up to this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in terms of size and tonnage,</v>

2043
01:58:43.181 --> 01:58:46.480
<v Speaker 1>it may be the biggest fleet ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It weighs anchor.</v>

2044
01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:51.720
<v Speaker 1>It starts making its way to where this </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambush point is and it leaves so early </v>

2045
01:58:52.601 --> 01:58:57.601
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's got all this advanced </v>

2046
01:58:57.601 --> 01:58:58.360
<v Speaker 1>information that it totally screws up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of ab role sheers ambush because his</v>

2047
01:58:58.370 --> 01:58:59.190
<v Speaker 1>forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2048
01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:02.880
<v Speaker 1>he had these submarines that were going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be outside the British ports and that</v>

2049
01:59:02.881 --> 01:59:04.570
<v Speaker 1>they could shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British ships,</v>

2050
01:59:04.571 --> 01:59:06.730
<v Speaker 1>as they left the harbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of that stuff's ready.</v>

2051
01:59:07.420 --> 01:59:12.420
<v Speaker 1>And so the British ships make their way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the rendezvous point where with the </v>

2052
01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:16.141
<v Speaker 1>Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're setting up another trafalgar </v>

2053
01:59:16.141 --> 01:59:16.141
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2054
01:59:16.141 --> 01:59:20.281
<v Speaker 1>if the British fleet emerges into view </v>
<v Speaker 1>and catches the German fleet there,</v>

2055
01:59:21.461 --> 01:59:23.860
<v Speaker 1>you could sink half of it before they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get away.</v>

2056
01:59:24.190 --> 01:59:29.190
<v Speaker 1>And then Murphy's law joins the battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Murphy's law takes center stage in this </v>

2057
01:59:30.611 --> 01:59:31.510
<v Speaker 1>encounter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2058
01:59:31.511 --> 01:59:36.511
<v Speaker 1>which would have made a great dress </v>
<v Speaker 1>rehearsal for early 20th century naval </v>

2059
01:59:36.511 --> 01:59:37.990
<v Speaker 1>warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

2060
01:59:37.991 --> 01:59:42.991
<v Speaker 1>it's opening night and you know you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>troubles on opening night with all of </v>

2061
01:59:43.091 --> 01:59:44.680
<v Speaker 1>the loose ends that haven't been fixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

2062
01:59:44.681 --> 01:59:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Imagine instead of opening night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing the dress rehearsal and yet</v>

2063
01:59:47.741 --> 01:59:51.010
<v Speaker 1>you have 250 ships in about 15 square </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles.</v>

2064
01:59:51.011 --> 01:59:56.011
<v Speaker 1>When these things come together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the things that can go wrong and </v>

2065
01:59:56.011 --> 01:59:56.920
<v Speaker 1>do go wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect this battle mightily.</v>

2066
01:59:56.921 --> 01:59:59.950
<v Speaker 1>And it's a good argument for why these </v>
<v Speaker 1>admirals are so cautious.</v>

2067
01:59:59.951 --> 02:00:00.850
<v Speaker 1>They know this.</v>

2068
02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:07.120
<v Speaker 1>So Murphy's law intervenes while the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British are about to pounce on the </v>

2069
02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:10.871
<v Speaker 1>Germans because the British send a </v>
<v Speaker 1>message back to their intelligence </v>

2070
02:00:10.871 --> 02:00:10.871
<v Speaker 1>service wanting a confirmation of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>or that.</v>

2071
02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:15.970
<v Speaker 1>And the intelligence people reading the </v>
<v Speaker 1>German naval codes tell them that they </v>

2072
02:00:15.970 --> 02:00:17.480
<v Speaker 1>made a mistake earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

2073
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German fleets not at sea like we </v>

2074
02:00:22.510 --> 02:00:22.510
<v Speaker 1>thought there's still safely important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about it.</v>

2075
02:00:22.940 --> 02:00:27.940
<v Speaker 1>So now these admirals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who five minutes ago knew where the </v>

2076
02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:28.250
<v Speaker 1>German fleet was and we're ready to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounce on it,</v>

2077
02:00:28.580 --> 02:00:32.990
<v Speaker 1>don't know they're there anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course they are.</v>

2078
02:00:33.710 --> 02:00:38.710
<v Speaker 1>And so now we have both main fleets </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to each other in the North Sea.</v>

2079
02:00:39.950 --> 02:00:43.070
<v Speaker 1>None of them aware of the other's </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

2080
02:00:45.720 --> 02:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>So the rhythm of this battle of Jutland </v>
<v Speaker 1>is wonderful,</v>

2081
02:00:48.871 --> 02:00:51.780
<v Speaker 1>starts off as a trap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flips into a counter trap,</v>

2082
02:00:51.781 --> 02:00:56.781
<v Speaker 1>and now it is serendipitously morphed </v>
<v Speaker 1>into an encounter battle and that's how </v>

2083
02:00:57.841 --> 02:01:02.841
<v Speaker 1>it gets started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>German light forces on one side of the </v>

2084
02:01:02.841 --> 02:01:07.081
<v Speaker 1>horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>British light forces on the other side </v>

2085
02:01:07.081 --> 02:01:09.331
<v Speaker 1>of horizon spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a civilian trawler between the two of </v>

2086
02:01:09.371 --> 02:01:14.371
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't see each other because </v>

2087
02:01:14.371 --> 02:01:15.601
<v Speaker 1>they're so far away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The curvature of the earth limits their </v>

2088
02:01:15.601 --> 02:01:15.601
<v Speaker 1>site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can both see the trawler.</v>

2089
02:01:15.601 --> 02:01:15.700
<v Speaker 1>So these light units,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2090
02:01:15.790 --> 02:01:17.560
<v Speaker 1>converge on the trawler to investigate </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2091
02:01:17.561 --> 02:01:22.561
<v Speaker 1>discovery each other's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts shooting and send messages back </v>

2092
02:01:22.561 --> 02:01:22.960
<v Speaker 1>to the main fleet saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what I have found over here on the</v>

2093
02:01:22.961 --> 02:01:25.570
<v Speaker 1>other side of the horizon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the enemy fleet,</v>

2094
02:01:25.630 --> 02:01:25.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2095
02:01:26.950 --> 02:01:31.950
<v Speaker 1>And so this creates like a war vortex </v>
<v Speaker 1>where all these naval forces start </v>

2096
02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>converging on this area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ships that arrive first are the </v>

2097
02:01:37.020 --> 02:01:40.400
<v Speaker 1>battlecruisers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an side of the story because the</v>

2098
02:01:40.401 --> 02:01:45.401
<v Speaker 1>battle cruisers are experiencing a test </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now and it's the test of whether </v>

2099
02:01:45.981 --> 02:01:50.981
<v Speaker 1>or not the admirals that backed this </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire design in the decades before this</v>

2100
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:57.070
<v Speaker 1>period were correct about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a theoretical argument until </v>

2101
02:01:57.531 --> 02:02:02.531
<v Speaker 1>there's data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there hasn't been a chance to have any </v>

2102
02:02:02.531 --> 02:02:02.531
<v Speaker 1>data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're going to have data.</v>

2103
02:02:02.531 --> 02:02:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Are these ships viable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2104
02:02:05.010 --> 02:02:06.290
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to know what they are.</v>

2105
02:02:06.291 --> 02:02:11.291
<v Speaker 1>A battle cruiser is a hybrid design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to combine the punching </v>

2106
02:02:11.661 --> 02:02:15.200
<v Speaker 1>power of a battleship with the speed of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a cruiser.</v>

2107
02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:19.880
<v Speaker 1>So if a battleship is like some giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>lion,</v>

2108
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:22.010
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or tiger,</v>

2109
02:02:22.370 --> 02:02:25.490
<v Speaker 1>these battle cruisers are more like </v>
<v Speaker 1>panthers.</v>

2110
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Now this is going to be confusing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they are all named after like </v>

2111
02:02:31.030 --> 02:02:34.091
<v Speaker 1>giant cats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the flagship of this battle </v>

2112
02:02:34.091 --> 02:02:34.490
<v Speaker 1>cruiser squadron on the British side is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lion.</v>

2113
02:02:34.490 --> 02:02:36.710
<v Speaker 1>So don't get confused if I start talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the lion.</v>

2114
02:02:37.090 --> 02:02:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that describes it pretty well.</v>

2115
02:02:39.890 --> 02:02:44.890
<v Speaker 1>The hypothetical problem here though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you had to give up to get the </v>

2116
02:02:44.991 --> 02:02:49.991
<v Speaker 1>speed of a cruiser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to give up the armor of the </v>

2117
02:02:49.991 --> 02:02:53.411
<v Speaker 1>battleship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we have here is a ship with all </v>

2118
02:02:53.411 --> 02:02:57.461
<v Speaker 1>the striking power of a battleship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one that can't take a punch by a </v>

2119
02:02:57.531 --> 02:03:02.531
<v Speaker 1>battleship or its counterparts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another battle cruiser.</v>

2120
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:05.600
<v Speaker 1>When this was pointed out before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

2121
02:03:05.601 --> 02:03:10.601
<v Speaker 1>the admirals who liked the battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>cruiser concept waved off this worry by </v>

2122
02:03:10.601 --> 02:03:13.160
<v Speaker 1>saying don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speed will be their armor.</v>

2123
02:03:13.670 --> 02:03:18.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the argument is because</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody knows if speed will be their </v>

2124
02:03:18.670 --> 02:03:20.270
<v Speaker 1>armor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These battlecruisers approach,</v>

2125
02:03:20.271 --> 02:03:25.271
<v Speaker 1>this battle at 26 or 27 knots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is amazingly fast for a ship their</v>

2126
02:03:26.001 --> 02:03:31.001
<v Speaker 1>size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are six of them on the British </v>

2127
02:03:31.001 --> 02:03:31.001
<v Speaker 1>side and five of them on the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

2128
02:03:31.001 --> 02:03:35.860
<v Speaker 1>And when they meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they begin to open fire and only about </v>

2129
02:03:35.860 --> 02:03:37.700
<v Speaker 1>like eight miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is short.</v>

2130
02:03:38.630 --> 02:03:41.030
<v Speaker 1>And the British have the longer range </v>
<v Speaker 1>guns by the way.</v>

2131
02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:46.240
<v Speaker 1>But don't open fire first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This becomes the first of many things </v>

2132
02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:47.120
<v Speaker 1>that the British admiral of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>battlecruisers,</v>

2133
02:03:47.121 --> 02:03:49.760
<v Speaker 1>a guy named beatty will be critiqued </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

2134
02:03:50.210 --> 02:03:51.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after this battle,</v>

2135
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:55.940
<v Speaker 1>the battle opens up at about 3:45</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the afternoon.</v>

2136
02:03:56.360 --> 02:04:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Visually it is hard to see the ships if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually see a picture of them at </v>

2137
02:04:02.841 --> 02:04:05.690
<v Speaker 1>full tilt are smoking like they're on </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

2138
02:04:05.900 --> 02:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>And when you have a bunch of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're putting tons of this dark suit </v>

2139
02:04:10.900 --> 02:04:11.000
<v Speaker 1>into the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Add to that,</v>

2140
02:04:11.001 --> 02:04:14.360
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we're over by Denmark in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the North Sea,</v>

2141
02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:16.970
<v Speaker 1>there's fog there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>squalls,</v>

2142
02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.250
<v Speaker 1>there's missed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's rain,</v>

2143
02:04:19.251 --> 02:04:22.700
<v Speaker 1>there's all kinds of things that inhibit</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to see very well.</v>

2144
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:27.790
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes one fleet will be in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>position where they see the other fleet </v>

2145
02:04:27.790 --> 02:04:29.360
<v Speaker 1>really well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other fleet doesn't see them and</v>

2146
02:04:29.361 --> 02:04:30.050
<v Speaker 1>vice versa.</v>

2147
02:04:30.050 --> 02:04:34.010
<v Speaker 1>So the part of being a good Amaryllis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to arrange your fleet so that the</v>

2148
02:04:34.011 --> 02:04:39.011
<v Speaker 1>other fleet is highlighted against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horizon or in some way makes them an </v>

2149
02:04:39.011 --> 02:04:40.680
<v Speaker 1>easier target and your fleet is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>obscured and hard to hit,</v>

2150
02:04:41.370 --> 02:04:46.370
<v Speaker 1>but ships had not tried to shoot at each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other and some of the ranges they're </v>

2151
02:04:46.370 --> 02:04:46.860
<v Speaker 1>going to try to shoot at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>

2152
02:04:48.090 --> 02:04:51.180
<v Speaker 1>When these battle cruisers start </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting at about 3:45,</v>

2153
02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:56.780
<v Speaker 1>the British shoot long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>initially over the heads of the German </v>

2154
02:04:56.780 --> 02:05:00.771
<v Speaker 1>ships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German ships are disconcertingly </v>

2155
02:05:00.771 --> 02:05:03.531
<v Speaker 1>accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They strike the battle cruiser Tiger </v>

2156
02:05:03.531 --> 02:05:06.060
<v Speaker 1>like six times in quick succession with </v>
<v Speaker 1>11 inch shells.</v>

2157
02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:11.970
<v Speaker 1>Then at 4:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>they strike the flagship,</v>

2158
02:05:12.180 --> 02:05:17.180
<v Speaker 1>the lion with Admiral Beatty on board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shells penetrate the Turret,</v>

2159
02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:21.900
<v Speaker 1>which is the sort of armored bubble that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that contains the big guns.</v>

2160
02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:26.040
<v Speaker 1>The touristy either explodes or catches </v>
<v Speaker 1>on fire and there are photographs,</v>

2161
02:05:26.041 --> 02:05:28.710
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have moments in the battle of Jutland.</v>

2162
02:05:28.711 --> 02:05:32.490
<v Speaker 1>They're not great and I always imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>them zoomed in and colorized,</v>

2163
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:37.790
<v Speaker 1>but you can see the lion burning and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks bad and admiral beatty didn't </v>

2164
02:05:38.371 --> 02:05:43.320
<v Speaker 1>realize at the time how closely he came </v>
<v Speaker 1>to being blown to kingdom come.</v>

2165
02:05:43.950 --> 02:05:48.950
<v Speaker 1>They'll find out later that a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was dying and who had lost both his </v>

2166
02:05:49.291 --> 02:05:52.020
<v Speaker 1>legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the lion,</v>

2167
02:05:52.230 --> 02:05:57.230
<v Speaker 1>saved the ship by flooding the magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last order he gave was to to flood </v>

2168
02:05:57.230 --> 02:06:01.620
<v Speaker 1>the whole area where the explosives or </v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep them from blowing the ship up.</v>

2169
02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if beatty was wondering what it would be</v>

2170
02:06:04.321 --> 02:06:09.321
<v Speaker 1>like to see one of these modern amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>ships explode,</v>

2171
02:06:09.780 --> 02:06:14.780
<v Speaker 1>he only had to wait about two minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you actually look at the moment by </v>

2172
02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:18.861
<v Speaker 1>moment rundown of this battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of the fun of naval </v>

2173
02:06:18.861 --> 02:06:21.501
<v Speaker 1>battles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these ships kept a very descriptive </v>

2174
02:06:21.501 --> 02:06:24.240
<v Speaker 1>and detailed logs about their movements </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment by moment by moment.</v>

2175
02:06:24.241 --> 02:06:29.241
<v Speaker 1>They've reconstructed this entire battle</v>
<v Speaker 1>from almost each individual ships </v>

2176
02:06:29.241 --> 02:06:32.811
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint and the part that strikes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you read a rundown is how quickly </v>

2177
02:06:32.811 --> 02:06:34.290
<v Speaker 1>everything is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So beatty suffers.</v>

2178
02:06:34.291 --> 02:06:37.350
<v Speaker 1>This hit on his own target at like 4:00,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two minutes later,</v>

2179
02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:41.790
<v Speaker 1>the HMS indefensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a somewhere in the 20,000</v>

2180
02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:45.840
<v Speaker 1>tons of battle cruiser explodes,</v>

2181
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:52.350
<v Speaker 1>just explodes in a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Churchill in the admiralty is </v>

2182
02:06:52.350 --> 02:06:53.680
<v Speaker 1>nightmare come true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in a blink of an eye,</v>

2183
02:06:53.950 --> 02:06:58.300
<v Speaker 1>you have a towering cloud reaching up </v>
<v Speaker 1>like 1500 feet.</v>

2184
02:06:58.330 --> 02:07:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Witnesses say you could see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2185
02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:06.000
<v Speaker 1>funnels and guns and everything shooting</v>
<v Speaker 1>up into the horizon and both sides.</v>

2186
02:07:07.631 --> 02:07:09.820
<v Speaker 1>German and British watched this happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>together</v>

2187
02:07:12.130 --> 02:07:16.840
<v Speaker 1>out of the more than 1000 sailors on </v>
<v Speaker 1>board the indivisible to survive.</v>

2188
02:07:17.500 --> 02:07:20.170
<v Speaker 1>It's hard not to include an account by </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them.</v>

2189
02:07:20.470 --> 02:07:25.470
<v Speaker 1>How do you not include an account of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>survivor of a ship who's magazine gets </v>

2190
02:07:25.481 --> 02:07:30.481
<v Speaker 1>penetrated and explodes with him on it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he was way up high in the top </v>

2191
02:07:30.481 --> 02:07:32.830
<v Speaker 1>observational area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>D Still Call that a crows nest.</v>

2192
02:07:32.831 --> 02:07:37.831
<v Speaker 1>He said he was 180 feet high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name is c Follmer,</v>

2193
02:07:38.290 --> 02:07:42.160
<v Speaker 1>and here's how he describes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>explosion of the hms into forgettable.</v>

2194
02:07:42.580 --> 02:07:47.580
<v Speaker 1>While he was on board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a terrific explosion aboard </v>

2195
02:07:47.580 --> 02:07:48.670
<v Speaker 1>the ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The magazines went.</v>

2196
02:07:48.940 --> 02:07:52.390
<v Speaker 1>I saw the guns go up in the air just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like matchsticks 12 inch guns.</v>

2197
02:07:52.391 --> 02:07:57.391
<v Speaker 1>They were bodies and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was beginning to settle down within </v>

2198
02:07:57.391 --> 02:08:01.801
<v Speaker 1>half a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ship turned right over and she was </v>

2199
02:08:01.801 --> 02:08:03.931
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 180 feet up and I was thrown well </v>

2200
02:08:03.931 --> 02:08:03.931
<v Speaker 1>clear of the ship.</v>

2201
02:08:03.931 --> 02:08:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise I would have been sucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>under.</v>

2202
02:08:05.050 --> 02:08:08.680
<v Speaker 1>I was practically unconscious turning </v>
<v Speaker 1>over really at last.</v>

2203
02:08:08.681 --> 02:08:10.960
<v Speaker 1>I came on top of the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I came up,</v>

2204
02:08:10.961 --> 02:08:14.410
<v Speaker 1>there was another fellow named Jimmy </v>
<v Speaker 1>Green and we got a piece of wood.</v>

2205
02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:18.490
<v Speaker 1>He was on one end and I was on the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>end a couple of minutes afterwards.</v>

2206
02:08:18.491 --> 02:08:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Some shells came over and Jim was minus </v>
<v Speaker 1>his head,</v>

2207
02:08:21.850 --> 02:08:26.850
<v Speaker 1>so I was left on my lonesome and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote now about 20 minutes after that,</v>

2208
02:08:30.550 --> 02:08:35.550
<v Speaker 1>the HMS Queen Mary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another one of these battle cruisers </v>

2209
02:08:35.550 --> 02:08:37.060
<v Speaker 1>explodes same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a little bit different.</v>

2210
02:08:37.061 --> 02:08:42.061
<v Speaker 1>I mean she gets hit and then there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>this pause and sailors are jumping into </v>

2211
02:08:42.061 --> 02:08:45.571
<v Speaker 1>the water and then she explodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have accounts from sailors who were </v>

2212
02:08:45.571 --> 02:08:49.351
<v Speaker 1>in the water who said that the sky was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden just filled with all </v>

2213
02:08:49.351 --> 02:08:52.381
<v Speaker 1>this massively heavy debris that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling down on them in the water and </v>

2214
02:08:52.391 --> 02:08:57.391
<v Speaker 1>they're all diving under the water </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to escape giant funnels and big </v>

2215
02:08:57.391 --> 02:08:59.890
<v Speaker 1>metal objects falling on them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a lot of them didn't escape.</v>

2216
02:09:00.100 --> 02:09:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than a thousand of these sailors on</v>

2217
02:09:03.221 --> 02:09:06.070
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A small handful rescued afterwards,</v>

2218
02:09:06.071 --> 02:09:11.071
<v Speaker 1>less than less than 25 and at one point </v>
<v Speaker 1>admiral beatty turns to a subordinate </v>

2219
02:09:11.781 --> 02:09:16.781
<v Speaker 1>and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there seems to be something wrong with </v>

2220
02:09:16.781 --> 02:09:16.781
<v Speaker 1>our bloody ships today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's right.</v>

2221
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:22.350
<v Speaker 1>They're not passing the acid test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hypothesis that you know was the </v>

2222
02:09:23.291 --> 02:09:26.580
<v Speaker 1>philosophical underpinnings of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire class of warships,</v>

2223
02:09:26.590 --> 02:09:29.980
<v Speaker 1>at least on the British side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is proving to be flawed.</v>

2224
02:09:31.420 --> 02:09:36.420
<v Speaker 1>They don't have enough armor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speed is not turning out to be their </v>

2225
02:09:36.551 --> 02:09:41.551
<v Speaker 1>armor and when their armor gets pierced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the way they're handling this </v>

2226
02:09:41.861 --> 02:09:46.861
<v Speaker 1>ammunition and the lack of flash </v>
<v Speaker 1>protectors and some other things means </v>

2227
02:09:46.861 --> 02:09:50.110
<v Speaker 1>that the magazine is catching on fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>and exploding way too easily and you can</v>

2228
02:09:50.111 --> 02:09:52.660
<v Speaker 1>tell that it's happening too easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm my German side.</v>

2229
02:09:52.661 --> 02:09:56.770
<v Speaker 1>It's not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sacrificed in some other areas,</v>

2230
02:09:56.771 --> 02:09:58.270
<v Speaker 1>their guns are smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2231
02:09:58.271 --> 02:10:01.050
<v Speaker 1>they're a little slower in order to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>slab,</v>

2232
02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:03.430
<v Speaker 1>some more armor over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these vulnerable points,</v>

2233
02:10:03.431 --> 02:10:08.431
<v Speaker 1>and they're not blowing up again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These Germans build ships like Mercedes </v>

2234
02:10:10.861 --> 02:10:15.861
<v Speaker 1>and they're taking a pounding while they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are running away.</v>

2235
02:10:17.140 --> 02:10:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Now that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you have to notice and </v>

2236
02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:22.140
<v Speaker 1>what's happening in these battles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know these ships are not stationary,</v>

2237
02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:23.860
<v Speaker 1>they're not anchored in staying in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same spot.</v>

2238
02:10:23.861 --> 02:10:27.070
<v Speaker 1>They're all moving and they're all </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving in a specific direction.</v>

2239
02:10:27.071 --> 02:10:30.790
<v Speaker 1>The British are chasing the Germans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans are moving away.</v>

2240
02:10:31.300 --> 02:10:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were the British admiral,</v>

2241
02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:35.480
<v Speaker 1>this makes perfect sense to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got the bigger ships,</v>

2242
02:10:35.481 --> 02:10:40.481
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And until they start exploding around </v>

2243
02:10:40.481 --> 02:10:40.481
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have more of them.</v>

2244
02:10:40.481 --> 02:10:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a bunch of big brand new,</v>

2245
02:10:41.661 --> 02:10:44.510
<v Speaker 1>the newest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most awesome battle ships in the world.</v>

2246
02:10:44.511 --> 02:10:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Their Queen Elizabeth Class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've already mentioned war spite,</v>

2247
02:10:48.501 --> 02:10:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Malaya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>valiant,</v>

2248
02:10:49.361 --> 02:10:52.340
<v Speaker 1>and all these famous ships that will all</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight in the second world war.</v>

2249
02:10:52.510 --> 02:10:55.460
<v Speaker 1>They are fresh off the docks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 inch guns,</v>

2250
02:10:55.461 --> 02:10:56.600
<v Speaker 1>30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>tons,</v>

2251
02:10:56.810 --> 02:11:01.810
<v Speaker 1>13 inches of armor and babies got them </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him so you darn right,</v>

2252
02:11:02.451 --> 02:11:03.860
<v Speaker 1>these Germans are going to run away.</v>

2253
02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Nevermind that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2254
02:11:05.631 --> 02:11:09.680
<v Speaker 1>I tried to communicate with those </v>
<v Speaker 1>battleships using flags.</v>

2255
02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:13.420
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about Murphy's law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interposing,</v>

2256
02:11:13.450 --> 02:11:18.450
<v Speaker 1>it's will on this battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of it has to do with things that </v>

2257
02:11:18.450 --> 02:11:18.450
<v Speaker 1>just look so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In hindsight.</v>

2258
02:11:18.450 --> 02:11:23.081
<v Speaker 1>You know these ships have radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes these admirals are not that </v>

2259
02:11:23.081 --> 02:11:24.110
<v Speaker 1>cool about using it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it has problems by the way,</v>

2260
02:11:24.111 --> 02:11:29.111
<v Speaker 1>so sometimes they're blameless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of times these animals are </v>

2261
02:11:29.111 --> 02:11:32.411
<v Speaker 1>like the old guy trying to use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer and there's so much more </v>

2262
02:11:32.411 --> 02:11:36.881
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with the way they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought up and the things that they did </v>

2263
02:11:36.881 --> 02:11:40.631
<v Speaker 1>in the maneuvers in peace time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways these ships </v>

2264
02:11:40.631 --> 02:11:43.640
<v Speaker 1>communicate is by running the orders of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the admiral up on a flagpole.</v>

2265
02:11:43.641 --> 02:11:46.250
<v Speaker 1>They have all these different flags and </v>
<v Speaker 1>each one means something different.</v>

2266
02:11:46.251 --> 02:11:49.130
<v Speaker 1>So when the admiral wants to communicate</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the fleet,</v>

2267
02:11:49.131 --> 02:11:54.131
<v Speaker 1>his orders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they run a flag up the flag pole on his </v>

2268
02:11:54.131 --> 02:11:54.131
<v Speaker 1>ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flagship,</v>

2269
02:11:54.131 --> 02:11:54.560
<v Speaker 1>and then every other ship is supposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2270
02:11:54.561 --> 02:11:59.561
<v Speaker 1>as they see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run up the same one and you get the </v>

2271
02:11:59.561 --> 02:11:59.561
<v Speaker 1>message across.</v>

2272
02:11:59.561 --> 02:12:02.470
<v Speaker 1>But this is a method that was used a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred years before in Lord Nelson's </v>

2273
02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:07.361
<v Speaker 1>time when they're fighting Napoleon at </v>
<v Speaker 1>ranges that are exponentially shorter.</v>

2274
02:12:08.841 --> 02:12:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exponentially shorter than the distances</v>

2275
02:12:11.301 --> 02:12:14.210
<v Speaker 1>in this battle without the smoke and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these other things.</v>

2276
02:12:14.211 --> 02:12:19.211
<v Speaker 1>And in the peace time training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seemed to work fine in the rigors of </v>

2277
02:12:19.211 --> 02:12:21.200
<v Speaker 1>combat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not working fine.</v>

2278
02:12:21.230 --> 02:12:26.230
<v Speaker 1>And the big battleships don't see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>flag change when beatty tells them to do</v>

2279
02:12:27.111 --> 02:12:28.250
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2280
02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:31.200
<v Speaker 1>they're not here when this battle first </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>

2281
02:12:31.220 --> 02:12:32.750
<v Speaker 1>they've been playing catch up the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottle,</v>

2282
02:12:32.751 --> 02:12:37.751
<v Speaker 1>but now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are arriving on the scene and their </v>

2283
02:12:37.751 --> 02:12:37.751
<v Speaker 1>shells are falling sort of by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans.</v>

2284
02:12:37.751 --> 02:12:40.760
<v Speaker 1>And now the British think they've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>these German battlecruisers pin down.</v>

2285
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Even if you know you're losing a few of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your battle cruisers while you chase </v>

2286
02:12:45.790 --> 02:12:48.881
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what they don't know is that those </v>

2287
02:12:48.881 --> 02:12:51.341
<v Speaker 1>battlecruisers are leading them into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mall of the entire German navy,</v>

2288
02:12:52.071 --> 02:12:54.050
<v Speaker 1>which is coming up from about 40 miles </v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

2289
02:12:54.051 --> 02:12:59.051
<v Speaker 1>moving towards them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What started off as the German trap </v>

2290
02:12:59.051 --> 02:13:03.850
<v Speaker 1>flipped into the British counter trap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved and morphed into the encounter </v>

2291
02:13:03.850 --> 02:13:08.261
<v Speaker 1>battle has now by almost improvisational</v>
<v Speaker 1>luck,</v>

2292
02:13:09.590 --> 02:13:14.590
<v Speaker 1>become a German ambush again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if successful,</v>

2293
02:13:15.290 --> 02:13:20.290
<v Speaker 1>the German fleet could wipe out four or </v>
<v Speaker 1>five battle cruisers and four of the </v>

2294
02:13:21.771 --> 02:13:25.340
<v Speaker 1>newest ships in the British navy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be,</v>

2295
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:28.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure Winston Churchill would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I could speak for him here,</v>

2296
02:13:28.670 --> 02:13:32.850
<v Speaker 1>a catastrophe and the Germans on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>verge of making it happen,</v>

2297
02:13:34.380 --> 02:13:39.380
<v Speaker 1>and then a light cruiser scouting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the British sees the entire German fleet</v>

2298
02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:47.780
<v Speaker 1>on the horizon and radios the message </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to Amarillo beatty and the grand </v>

2299
02:13:47.780 --> 02:13:52.551
<v Speaker 1>fleet under Admiral Jellicoe farther </v>
<v Speaker 1>away and beatty sees those Germans very </v>

2300
02:13:52.551 --> 02:13:56.820
<v Speaker 1>quickly too with the naked eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing he does when he realizes</v>

2301
02:13:56.821 --> 02:14:01.821
<v Speaker 1>he's been baited into this trap is turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>his battle cruisers a hundred and 80 </v>

2302
02:14:01.821 --> 02:14:04.500
<v Speaker 1>degrees in the other direction and start</v>
<v Speaker 1>booking out of there.</v>

2303
02:14:05.310 --> 02:14:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Murphy's law,</v>

2304
02:14:07.470 --> 02:14:10.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll say that many times in this battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>if I go too deeply into it,</v>

2305
02:14:10.950 --> 02:14:15.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once again he runs up the flag saying </v>

2306
02:14:15.950 --> 02:14:17.040
<v Speaker 1>turnaround and the big battleships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brand new ones don't see it and they</v>

2307
02:14:17.041 --> 02:14:21.030
<v Speaker 1>will end up exposed out there to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire German fleet for a while taking a</v>

2308
02:14:21.031 --> 02:14:25.710
<v Speaker 1>pounding and dishing one out too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be pointed out nonetheless,</v>

2309
02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:29.610
<v Speaker 1>what Admiral Beatty has done by turning </v>
<v Speaker 1>180 degrees away,</v>

2310
02:14:30.090 --> 02:14:35.090
<v Speaker 1>his turn himself into bait and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans are following and beatty is </v>

2311
02:14:36.211 --> 02:14:41.211
<v Speaker 1>running back towards his big fleet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is coming up from also about 40 </v>

2312
02:14:41.211 --> 02:14:45.591
<v Speaker 1>miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now he's flipped the ambush once </v>

2313
02:14:45.591 --> 02:14:48.441
<v Speaker 1>again and now the Germans are heading </v>
<v Speaker 1>toward the only fleet that is still </v>

2314
02:14:48.841 --> 02:14:51.840
<v Speaker 1>invisible on this naval battlefield to </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>

2315
02:14:52.590 --> 02:14:55.620
<v Speaker 1>The Germans don't know that the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>grand fleet is up ahead of them,</v>

2316
02:14:58.070 --> 02:15:01.490
<v Speaker 1>but now the British Grand Fleet knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Germans are coming.</v>

2317
02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:05.390
<v Speaker 1>An Admiral Jellicoe in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a very brave move.</v>

2318
02:15:05.391 --> 02:15:07.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's operating without enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

2319
02:15:07.161 --> 02:15:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>admiral beatty gets blamed for not given</v>

2320
02:15:09.671 --> 02:15:10.030
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2321
02:15:10.040 --> 02:15:15.040
<v Speaker 1>good positional information or whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of this falls into the </v>

2322
02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:16.250
<v Speaker 1>category of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a dress rehearsal to these guys.</v>

2323
02:15:16.251 --> 02:15:21.251
<v Speaker 1>A lot of their errors are the kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things they would have corrected if </v>

2324
02:15:21.251 --> 02:15:22.020
<v Speaker 1>they'd had a chance to practice it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2325
02:15:22.130 --> 02:15:25.370
<v Speaker 1>combat situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately these are a lot of,</v>

2326
02:15:25.371 --> 02:15:27.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't call them rookie mistakes,</v>

2327
02:15:27.441 --> 02:15:32.441
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you would correct these before the </v>

2328
02:15:32.441 --> 02:15:32.441
<v Speaker 1>next battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

2329
02:15:32.441 --> 02:15:35.480
<v Speaker 1>jellicoe takes a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deploys the entire British grand fleet,</v>

2330
02:15:35.481 --> 02:15:39.170
<v Speaker 1>which is more than 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ships over 15,</v>

2331
02:15:39.171 --> 02:15:42.410
<v Speaker 1>20 square miles of ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes 15 to 20 minutes.</v>

2332
02:15:42.411 --> 02:15:47.411
<v Speaker 1>That's how well trained this fleet is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he deploys the whole thing and he's </v>

2333
02:15:47.411 --> 02:15:50.120
<v Speaker 1>waiting for the Germans to arrive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans are now in the midst,</v>

2334
02:15:50.630 --> 02:15:51.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This battlefields,</v>

2335
02:15:51.620 --> 02:15:56.620
<v Speaker 1>very misty and you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll run through fog banks and you </v>

2336
02:15:56.620 --> 02:15:57.380
<v Speaker 1>won't see things for awhile and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans can't see what's going on.</v>

2337
02:15:58.310 --> 02:16:03.310
<v Speaker 1>And famously Amro hipper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the German admiral in charge of </v>

2338
02:16:03.310 --> 02:16:06.311
<v Speaker 1>the battlecruisers radios,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Admiral Shear the head of the entire </v>

2339
02:16:06.311 --> 02:16:08.810
<v Speaker 1>German navy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's with the German fleet here,</v>

2340
02:16:08.990 --> 02:16:13.990
<v Speaker 1>and he famously looks off into the mist </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tell sheer something lurks in that </v>

2341
02:16:13.990 --> 02:16:18.971
<v Speaker 1>soup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would do well not to thrust into it </v>

2342
02:16:18.971 --> 02:16:19.280
<v Speaker 1>too deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too late.</v>

2343
02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:24.780
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the German start taking some fire and</v>

2344
02:16:24.781 --> 02:16:29.781
<v Speaker 1>they don't know from where big guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden the missed </v>

2345
02:16:29.781 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 1>parts for a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

2346
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:34.840
<v Speaker 6>it's a nother British battlecruisers the</v>
<v Speaker 6>invincible.</v>

2347
02:16:35.830 --> 02:16:39.220
<v Speaker 6>And as soon as the mist parts in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>invincible becomes clear,</v>

2348
02:16:39.520 --> 02:16:44.520
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't take 90 seconds before big </v>

2349
02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:46.771
<v Speaker 6>German guns are opening fire,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the shells pouring down on the </v>

2350
02:16:46.771 --> 02:16:48.730
<v Speaker 6>invincible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And like the other two battle cruisers,</v>

2351
02:16:48.731 --> 02:16:50.350
<v Speaker 6>the invincible explodes.</v>

2352
02:16:51.850 --> 02:16:54.430
<v Speaker 6>So if anybody has forgotten in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>intervening,</v>

2353
02:16:54.820 --> 02:16:56.620
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hour or two,</v>

2354
02:16:56.650 --> 02:16:58.870
<v Speaker 6>since the earlier battlecruisers </v>
<v Speaker 6>exploded,</v>

2355
02:16:59.140 --> 02:17:01.780
<v Speaker 6>that this design is proving to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>somewhat flawed.</v>

2356
02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:07.020
<v Speaker 6>The explosion of the invincible before </v>
<v Speaker 6>the two main fleets collide is a </v>

2357
02:17:07.020 --> 02:17:09.400
<v Speaker 6>historical reminder.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nonetheless.</v>

2358
02:17:09.401 --> 02:17:14.401
<v Speaker 6>It's only soon after that that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Germans emerge from the mist to find the</v>

2359
02:17:15.041 --> 02:17:20.041
<v Speaker 6>entire deployed British fleet waiting </v>
<v Speaker 6>for them in like a crescent around the </v>

2360
02:17:20.921 --> 02:17:25.210
<v Speaker 6>horizon and sheer says the minute that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they can see what's happening,</v>

2361
02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:28.390
<v Speaker 6>the entire horizon erupts in a sheet of </v>
<v Speaker 6>flame.</v>

2362
02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:30.460
<v Speaker 6>Now these ships are a long way from each</v>
<v Speaker 6>other,</v>

2363
02:17:30.461 --> 02:17:34.330
<v Speaker 6>almost invisible to the naked eye,</v>
<v Speaker 6>smudges up against the horizon.</v>

2364
02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:39.600
<v Speaker 6>You see like the smoke of all the ships </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then you see like the flash of the </v>

2365
02:17:39.821 --> 02:17:43.210
<v Speaker 6>guns and just like lightening and </v>
<v Speaker 6>thunder where you see the lightening and</v>

2366
02:17:43.211 --> 02:17:45.100
<v Speaker 6>then there's this delay and then the </v>
<v Speaker 6>thunder arrives.</v>

2367
02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:50.220
<v Speaker 6>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You see this flash and it's silent and </v>

2368
02:17:50.220 --> 02:17:53.551
<v Speaker 6>then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the boom hits you after the shells have </v>

2369
02:17:53.551 --> 02:17:55.600
<v Speaker 6>already passed over and you know there </v>
<v Speaker 6>are destroyers in these battles.</v>

2370
02:17:55.601 --> 02:17:56.790
<v Speaker 6>We haven't even talked about all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>lights.</v>

2371
02:17:56.791 --> 02:17:58.110
<v Speaker 6>Ships running around,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2372
02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:01.420
<v Speaker 6>sort of parrying and like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a bunch of little gnats between the</v>

2373
02:18:01.421 --> 02:18:06.421
<v Speaker 6>battle fleet and these destroyers </v>
<v Speaker 6>sometimes describe what it's like when </v>

2374
02:18:06.421 --> 02:18:09.670
<v Speaker 6>these giant shells pass over their heads</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they say they sound like locomotives</v>

2375
02:18:09.850 --> 02:18:12.460
<v Speaker 6>when they screech over your little ships</v>
<v Speaker 6>head,</v>

2376
02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:15.310
<v Speaker 6>but when they fall in front of your </v>
<v Speaker 6>little ship,</v>

2377
02:18:15.311 --> 02:18:19.450
<v Speaker 6>you're like your little destroyer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They raise geysers of water,</v>

2378
02:18:19.810 --> 02:18:24.810
<v Speaker 6>sometimes 100,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sometimes 200 feet up into the air and </v>

2379
02:18:24.810 --> 02:18:27.850
<v Speaker 6>it's composed of tons of liquid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which then falls back down to earth.</v>

2380
02:18:27.851 --> 02:18:32.851
<v Speaker 6>And these destroyers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these little ships are sometimes beaten </v>

2381
02:18:32.851 --> 02:18:34.270
<v Speaker 6>up pretty severely by all this water </v>
<v Speaker 6>smashing back down into them.</v>

2382
02:18:34.271 --> 02:18:37.750
<v Speaker 6>Some people are splashed overboard and </v>
<v Speaker 6>all these kinds of things.</v>

2383
02:18:39.380 --> 02:18:44.380
<v Speaker 6>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Admiral Jellicoe has performed a famous </v>

2384
02:18:44.380 --> 02:18:48.371
<v Speaker 6>naval maneuver that you never want to be</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the receiving end of called crossing </v>

2385
02:18:48.371 --> 02:18:51.530
<v Speaker 6>the t where he's formed the top crossbar</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the t and poor shear.</v>

2386
02:18:51.531 --> 02:18:53.750
<v Speaker 6>And the Germans form the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2387
02:18:54.510 --> 02:18:59.510
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>vertical line of the t and every one of </v>

2388
02:18:59.510 --> 02:19:02.261
<v Speaker 6>the British ships can fire on the German</v>
<v Speaker 6>ships individually as they come to the </v>

2389
02:19:02.261 --> 02:19:04.610
<v Speaker 6>front of the line.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a disaster very quickly.</v>

2390
02:19:04.620 --> 02:19:08.000
<v Speaker 6>Sheer gets hit with more than 22 heavy </v>
<v Speaker 6>shells fast.</v>

2391
02:19:08.001 --> 02:19:13.001
<v Speaker 6>And within 10 minutes shear has quite </v>
<v Speaker 6>tactically adroitly by the way,</v>

2392
02:19:13.431 --> 02:19:18.431
<v Speaker 6>turned his fleet around and disappeared </v>
<v Speaker 6>back into the mist and once again </v>

2393
02:19:18.431 --> 02:19:19.460
<v Speaker 6>without radar and all that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff,</v>

2394
02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:20.660
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hard to,</v>

2395
02:19:20.820 --> 02:19:25.820
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>know where he is at that point and he </v>

2396
02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:27.251
<v Speaker 6>sends out a bunch of light units and </v>
<v Speaker 6>destroyers and what not to cover his </v>

2397
02:19:27.251 --> 02:19:27.251
<v Speaker 6>escape.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the,</v>

2398
02:19:27.251 --> 02:19:27.980
<v Speaker 6>the British can't just after them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they might</v>

2399
02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:30.230
<v Speaker 1>run into a bunch of torpedoes and mines </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>

2400
02:19:31.100 --> 02:19:36.100
<v Speaker 1>And then inexplicably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not too long after the sheer arrives </v>

2401
02:19:36.100 --> 02:19:39.941
<v Speaker 1>back into visual range and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people fire again and then sheer escapes</v>

2402
02:19:40.221 --> 02:19:43.610
<v Speaker 1>again because he got his t crossed for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>second time in one battle,</v>

2403
02:19:43.611 --> 02:19:48.611
<v Speaker 1>which is almost unheard of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows you jellicoe is pretty darn </v>

2404
02:19:48.611 --> 02:19:51.041
<v Speaker 1>good admiral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a little night action </v>

2405
02:19:51.041 --> 02:19:53.591
<v Speaker 1>between the light units,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but about this time admiral shares had </v>

2406
02:19:53.591 --> 02:19:55.280
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get your tea cross twice in one day.</v>

2407
02:19:55.580 --> 02:20:00.580
<v Speaker 1>It's time to call it a battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Shear in the Germans manage to limp </v>

2408
02:20:00.580 --> 02:20:00.580
<v Speaker 1>home</v>

2409
02:20:02.180 --> 02:20:05.060
<v Speaker 1>when all is said and done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British lose three battlecruisers,</v>

2410
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:10.270
<v Speaker 1>three armored cruisers and destroyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while one German battle cruiser,</v>

2411
02:20:10.670 --> 02:20:15.670
<v Speaker 1>one pre dreadnought battleships for </v>
<v Speaker 1>light cruisers and destroyers are sent </v>

2412
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:20.021
<v Speaker 1>to the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The casualties at Jutland are not </v>

2413
02:20:20.021 --> 02:20:22.520
<v Speaker 1>significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't hurt either navy badly.</v>

2414
02:20:22.970 --> 02:20:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British learned their lesson about </v>

2415
02:20:27.970 --> 02:20:27.970
<v Speaker 1>the battle cruiser design,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Germans are humbled,</v>

2416
02:20:28.610 --> 02:20:31.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't come out again in strength.</v>

2417
02:20:31.191 --> 02:20:36.191
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a little encounter here and </v>

2418
02:20:36.191 --> 02:20:36.191
<v Speaker 1>a little try there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2419
02:20:36.191 --> 02:20:38.671
<v Speaker 1>but this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gave it an attempt and they seemed </v>

2420
02:20:39.020 --> 02:20:44.020
<v Speaker 1>permanently shaken because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The German surface fleet will not </v>

2421
02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:48.971
<v Speaker 1>perform another militarily significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>move in the war.</v>

2422
02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:55.210
<v Speaker 1>The only part of the German navy that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be relevant for the rest of the</v>

2423
02:20:55.211 --> 02:21:00.211
<v Speaker 1>war is the part that uses torpedoes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go after.</v>

2424
02:21:00.401 --> 02:21:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Not military targets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but economic ones.</v>

2425
02:21:05.470 --> 02:21:10.470
<v Speaker 1>By 1916,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economic side of this war is coming </v>

2426
02:21:10.841 --> 02:21:11.710
<v Speaker 1>to the fore.</v>

2427
02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:19.000
<v Speaker 1>We begin to see what war on this scale </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like when it becomes part of the </v>

2428
02:21:21.231 --> 02:21:26.231
<v Speaker 1>normal life of all of these countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know this isn't a new phenomenon </v>

2429
02:21:26.361 --> 02:21:28.400
<v Speaker 1>anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By 1916,</v>

2430
02:21:28.580 --> 02:21:33.580
<v Speaker 1>by the middle of 1916,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been doing this for two years and </v>

2431
02:21:33.580 --> 02:21:37.931
<v Speaker 1>it's been sucking up more and more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the energy of these nation states that </v>

2432
02:21:37.931 --> 02:21:42.401
<v Speaker 1>are involved in the conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very unlike the way most wars by </v>

2433
02:21:42.401 --> 02:21:46.901
<v Speaker 1>these powers had been fought where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilian population might not even know </v>

2434
02:21:46.901 --> 02:21:51.311
<v Speaker 1>a war is happening if it was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they certainly weren't directly or </v>

2435
02:21:51.921 --> 02:21:55.220
<v Speaker 1>importantly impacted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This war is different.</v>

2436
02:21:56.360 --> 02:21:57.950
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's life or death.</v>

2437
02:21:59.120 --> 02:22:04.120
<v Speaker 1>The stakes are so high that everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved and the armies are requiring </v>

2438
02:22:04.120 --> 02:22:06.680
<v Speaker 1>such immense amounts of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2439
02:22:06.681 --> 02:22:11.681
<v Speaker 1>the Germans will call this material </v>
<v Speaker 1>schlock the war of material that the </v>

2440
02:22:11.681 --> 02:22:16.091
<v Speaker 1>entire civilian population and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>production capacity of all these </v>

2441
02:22:16.091 --> 02:22:18.140
<v Speaker 1>countries gets warped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to provide it.</v>

2442
02:22:19.420 --> 02:22:23.050
<v Speaker 1>As historian Gwynne Dyer says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

2443
02:22:23.470 --> 02:22:26.130
<v Speaker 1>it is significant that the phrase </v>
<v Speaker 1>homefront</v>

2444
02:22:26.460 --> 02:22:30.720
<v Speaker 6>came into use during World War One when </v>
<v Speaker 6>the role of munitions workers,</v>

2445
02:22:30.721 --> 02:22:35.721
<v Speaker 6>enough civilian production more </v>
<v Speaker 6>generally was becoming as important to </v>

2446
02:22:35.721 --> 02:22:39.411
<v Speaker 6>victory as the soldiers in the trenches </v>
<v Speaker 6>without a constant flow of supplies </v>

2447
02:22:39.411 --> 02:22:41.520
<v Speaker 6>equal to the vast consumption at the </v>
<v Speaker 6>front.</v>

2448
02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:45.940
<v Speaker 6>The soldiers would soon be helpless,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and since the mobilization of so huge,</v>

2449
02:22:45.941 --> 02:22:49.980
<v Speaker 6>a number of men left vast gaps in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>normal workforce,</v>

2450
02:22:50.250 --> 02:22:53.610
<v Speaker 6>France had put 20 percent of its entire </v>
<v Speaker 6>population into uniform,</v>

2451
02:22:53.880 --> 02:22:56.610
<v Speaker 6>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 6>18 percent and the other major powers,</v>

2452
02:22:56.611 --> 02:23:01.611
<v Speaker 6>not much less.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The remaining adult civilians had to be </v>

2453
02:23:01.611 --> 02:23:05.091
<v Speaker 6>directed by government into whatever </v>
<v Speaker 6>jobs were needed to keep production </v>

2454
02:23:05.091 --> 02:23:05.190
<v Speaker 6>going.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In effect,</v>

2455
02:23:05.370 --> 02:23:10.370
<v Speaker 6>the civilian economy he writes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was conscripted to the governments of </v>

2456
02:23:10.370 --> 02:23:13.530
<v Speaker 6>Europe quickly took control over labor </v>
<v Speaker 6>and raw materials,</v>

2457
02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:16.050
<v Speaker 6>imposed rationing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>scarce goods,</v>

2458
02:23:16.140 --> 02:23:21.140
<v Speaker 6>and created true war economies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Women flooded into factories to replace </v>

2459
02:23:21.140 --> 02:23:26.121
<v Speaker 6>the men at the front and most production</v>
<v Speaker 6>beyond the basic needs of subsistence </v>

2460
02:23:26.121 --> 02:23:28.440
<v Speaker 6>was diverted into the war effort and </v>
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>

2461
02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:31.890
<v Speaker 6>diyers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>also the one that said,</v>

2462
02:23:31.891 --> 02:23:33.630
<v Speaker 6>by this time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>

2463
02:23:33.960 --> 02:23:38.160
<v Speaker 6>battles had become an industrial </v>
<v Speaker 6>operation in reverse.</v>

2464
02:23:38.460 --> 02:23:42.510
<v Speaker 6>In which the rates of destruction at the</v>
<v Speaker 6>front matched the rates of production in</v>

2465
02:23:42.511 --> 02:23:44.670
<v Speaker 6>the industry's at home.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And to quote,</v>

2466
02:23:45.090 --> 02:23:49.350
<v Speaker 6>I think of guys like the British </v>
<v Speaker 6>military leader,</v>

2467
02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:54.440
<v Speaker 6>Hey meg,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or even the German military leader </v>

2468
02:23:54.440 --> 02:23:57.650
<v Speaker 6>General Eric Von Falcon Han and I think </v>
<v Speaker 6>about all these skills that they're </v>

2469
02:23:57.650 --> 02:24:02.151
<v Speaker 6>required to have now above and beyond </v>
<v Speaker 6>what you would think of as a normal </v>

2470
02:24:02.251 --> 02:24:05.400
<v Speaker 6>generals skills.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you saw this in earlier wars.</v>

2471
02:24:05.401 --> 02:24:10.401
<v Speaker 6>There's famous stories of General </v>
<v Speaker 6>Sherman in the civil war in the United </v>

2472
02:24:10.401 --> 02:24:14.780
<v Speaker 6>States being extra qualified for modern </v>
<v Speaker 6>warfare because of all these failed jobs</v>

2473
02:24:14.911 --> 02:24:19.911
<v Speaker 6>in private industry.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He'd had the taught him all these </v>

2474
02:24:19.911 --> 02:24:20.700
<v Speaker 6>lessons that no one knew at general </v>
<v Speaker 6>would need in modern warfare.</v>

2475
02:24:20.701 --> 02:24:22.740
<v Speaker 6>Things about logistics and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

2476
02:24:23.190 --> 02:24:26.310
<v Speaker 6>But by 1916,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you a guy like,</v>

2477
02:24:26.311 --> 02:24:28.630
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a cavalry commander.</v>

2478
02:24:28.631 --> 02:24:31.230
<v Speaker 6>It looks like he would be totally out of</v>
<v Speaker 6>his element,</v>

2479
02:24:31.650 --> 02:24:34.290
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dealing with the modern production needs</v>

2480
02:24:34.291 --> 02:24:37.010
<v Speaker 6>of warfare as indeed he was Falcon </v>
<v Speaker 6>Hines,</v>

2481
02:24:37.020 --> 02:24:38.820
<v Speaker 6>a bit more scientific of a guy.</v>

2482
02:24:39.060 --> 02:24:39.870
<v Speaker 6>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2483
02:24:39.871 --> 02:24:42.400
<v Speaker 6>I was trying to think if I were general </v>
<v Speaker 6>fall behind,</v>

2484
02:24:42.410 --> 02:24:43.830
<v Speaker 6>if this were a war game.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2485
02:24:43.831 --> 02:24:48.831
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I played a lot of those in my time and </v>

2486
02:24:48.831 --> 02:24:49.350
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I got a signed because I don't think</v>

2487
02:24:49.351 --> 02:24:50.810
<v Speaker 6>I would take Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2488
02:24:50.860 --> 02:24:53.580
<v Speaker 6>if I had a choice of which side of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>war game I wanted to play,</v>

2489
02:24:53.700 --> 02:24:57.210
<v Speaker 6>but let's say I get assigned to Germany </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I command and played Germany in this</v>

2490
02:24:57.211 --> 02:25:00.210
<v Speaker 6>war game and I'm Falcon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2491
02:25:00.390 --> 02:25:05.390
<v Speaker 6>the estimates are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially during this time period that </v>

2492
02:25:05.390 --> 02:25:05.670
<v Speaker 6>if you include the colonial subjects of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2493
02:25:05.700 --> 02:25:07.860
<v Speaker 6>of the powers in Europe during this time</v>
<v Speaker 6>period,</v>

2494
02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:13.160
<v Speaker 6>my enemies in this war,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I'm falling behind and have $750 </v>

2495
02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:18.051
<v Speaker 6>million people they can call on for </v>
<v Speaker 6>their value in their effort.</v>

2496
02:25:18.451 --> 02:25:23.451
<v Speaker 6>And in some cases their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My side of the alliance has about $150 </v>

2497
02:25:23.921 --> 02:25:24.370
<v Speaker 6>million.</v>

2498
02:25:25.390 --> 02:25:27.550
<v Speaker 1>My enemies have the greatest fleet in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

2499
02:25:27.551 --> 02:25:30.790
<v Speaker 1>And I just learned at the battle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jutland that my navy can't come anywhere</v>

2500
02:25:30.791 --> 02:25:31.540
<v Speaker 1>near touching them</v>

2501
02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:37.150
<v Speaker 1>and they've shut down all of my overseas</v>
<v Speaker 1>trade.</v>

2502
02:25:37.750 --> 02:25:40.540
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm General Falcon High and </v>
<v Speaker 1>already I'm sitting here going,</v>

2503
02:25:40.930 --> 02:25:45.930
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you look at the lineup in terms of </v>

2504
02:25:45.930 --> 02:25:47.020
<v Speaker 1>the kinds of countries in each alliance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2505
02:25:47.021 --> 02:25:52.021
<v Speaker 1>You have the British and the French and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians as the three big guys in </v>

2506
02:25:52.021 --> 02:25:55.150
<v Speaker 1>the allied Entente alliance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are all first rate powers.</v>

2507
02:25:55.151 --> 02:25:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Betsy power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>best land power,</v>

2508
02:25:57.360 --> 02:25:59.470
<v Speaker 1>biggest power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all three together.</v>

2509
02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they have a bunch of other </v>

2510
02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:05.530
<v Speaker 1>countries like Italy and smaller powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very powerful force.</v>

2511
02:26:05.531 --> 02:26:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Who Do I have on my side?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austria,</v>

2512
02:26:08.651 --> 02:26:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Hungary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bulgaria and Turkey.</v>

2513
02:26:10.781 --> 02:26:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of those powers are first rate.</v>

2514
02:26:14.290 --> 02:26:17.440
<v Speaker 1>At least the Turks aren't asking me for </v>
<v Speaker 1>help all the time.</v>

2515
02:26:17.441 --> 02:26:20.140
<v Speaker 1>If I'm Falcon nine though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're putting on a pretty brave fight.</v>

2516
02:26:20.141 --> 02:26:22.570
<v Speaker 1>They've managed to kick the British,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>

2517
02:26:22.630 --> 02:26:23.980
<v Speaker 1>South Africans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indians,</v>

2518
02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:27.510
<v Speaker 1>New Zealanders and Australians out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gullapalli in January,</v>

2519
02:26:27.530 --> 02:26:30.760
<v Speaker 1>1916.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's unexpected.</v>

2520
02:26:31.340 --> 02:26:33.830
<v Speaker 1>They've managed to beat the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces,</v>

2521
02:26:33.831 --> 02:26:38.831
<v Speaker 1>mostly Indian troops in a place called </v>
<v Speaker 1>coot and modern day Iraq trap them in a </v>

2522
02:26:38.831 --> 02:26:43.121
<v Speaker 1>fortress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're forced them to surrender and </v>

2523
02:26:43.121 --> 02:26:44.450
<v Speaker 1>took them on a death march,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really doesn't impact Falcon hind</v>

2524
02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:45.530
<v Speaker 1>very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One way or the other,</v>

2525
02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:50.800
<v Speaker 1>it's just nice for him to know that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Turks are winning as opposed to losing </v>

2526
02:26:50.800 --> 02:26:50.840
<v Speaker 1>because they are losing against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians,</v>

2527
02:26:50.841 --> 02:26:52.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's a mixed bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

2528
02:26:52.490 --> 02:26:57.490
<v Speaker 1>the Turks are tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are not quite a 20th century </v>

2529
02:26:57.490 --> 02:27:01.841
<v Speaker 1>army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those are all that's gravy to Falcon </v>

2530
02:27:01.841 --> 02:27:01.841
<v Speaker 1>Hein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bigger problem,</v>

2531
02:27:01.841 --> 02:27:04.130
<v Speaker 1>if you're [inaudible] hine is your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your close allies,</v>

2532
02:27:04.131 --> 02:27:07.460
<v Speaker 1>the Austro-hungarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a pain in the rear.</v>

2533
02:27:07.610 --> 02:27:12.610
<v Speaker 1>They don't listen to you to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're having fights with their main </v>

2534
02:27:12.610 --> 02:27:15.341
<v Speaker 1>military leaders and then they go do </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they want anyway and then they </v>

2535
02:27:15.341 --> 02:27:18.791
<v Speaker 1>screw up because they didn't follow your</v>
<v Speaker 1>advice and then they come to you and </v>

2536
02:27:18.791 --> 02:27:18.791
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you bail us out?</v>

2537
02:27:18.791 --> 02:27:23.200
<v Speaker 1>If you're falling behind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're a pain in the rear and he's </v>

2538
02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:25.541
<v Speaker 1>continually having to take scarce troop </v>
<v Speaker 1>from places like Verdun and instead </v>

2539
02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:31.360
<v Speaker 1>taking the train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sending them over east and and saving </v>

2540
02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:31.640
<v Speaker 1>the Hungarians Bacon.</v>

2541
02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Can't really blame them though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in big trouble anyway.</v>

2542
02:27:35.460 --> 02:27:37.680
<v Speaker 1>They may not have been a country in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1920,</v>

2543
02:27:37.681 --> 02:27:39.510
<v Speaker 1>even if there hadn't been a first world </v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

2544
02:27:39.780 --> 02:27:42.990
<v Speaker 1>They're made up of 11 major ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups in that state,</v>

2545
02:27:43.230 --> 02:27:48.230
<v Speaker 1>some of whom don't want to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their army is a microcosm of their </v>

2546
02:27:48.230 --> 02:27:52.611
<v Speaker 1>state and you've got troops who don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even want to be in your empire at times </v>

2547
02:27:53.790 --> 02:27:57.390
<v Speaker 1>on the front line that you're asking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>die for your empire.</v>

2548
02:27:57.420 --> 02:28:02.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're constantly getting into trouble </v>

2549
02:28:02.420 --> 02:28:05.871
<v Speaker 1>and as one German diplomat famously says</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Germany's situation with Austria </v>

2550
02:28:05.971 --> 02:28:10.020
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are fettered to a corpse were tied to</v>

2551
02:28:10.021 --> 02:28:13.140
<v Speaker 1>a dead guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the Austro-hungarian forced.</v>

2552
02:28:13.141 --> 02:28:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Now in your favor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're Falcon Hine,</v>

2553
02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:19.920
<v Speaker 1>you probably have the best army in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

2554
02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:21.890
<v Speaker 1>The 1916</v>

2555
02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:27.100
<v Speaker 6>German army is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a combination of the best aspects </v>

2556
02:28:27.621 --> 02:28:30.260
<v Speaker 6>of the 1914 force that Germany went to </v>
<v Speaker 6>war with,</v>

2557
02:28:31.010 --> 02:28:36.010
<v Speaker 6>but battle hardened by experience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's the way writer in Passingham </v>

2558
02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:37.520
<v Speaker 6>describes it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>

2559
02:28:38.120 --> 02:28:42.020
<v Speaker 6>it is true that the German army on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>western front by early 1916,</v>

2560
02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:45.290
<v Speaker 6>was more skilled and better equipped for</v>
<v Speaker 6>trench warfare.</v>

2561
02:28:45.291 --> 02:28:48.740
<v Speaker 6>The neither the British or the French.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is not too surprising.</v>

2562
02:28:48.741 --> 02:28:51.130
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as the British expeditionary force,</v>

2563
02:28:51.131 --> 02:28:54.800
<v Speaker 6>it only just expanded its army from </v>
<v Speaker 6>around 250,000</v>

2564
02:28:54.980 --> 02:28:59.980
<v Speaker 6>in 1914 to just over a million,</v>
<v Speaker 6>largely inexperienced men and the French</v>

2565
02:29:00.441 --> 02:29:05.441
<v Speaker 6>he writes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>had always been uncomfortable with the </v>

2566
02:29:05.441 --> 02:29:06.530
<v Speaker 6>notion of defensive operations rather </v>
<v Speaker 6>than the offensive spirit.</v>

2567
02:29:07.130 --> 02:29:08.330
<v Speaker 6>He then says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>

2568
02:29:08.630 --> 02:29:11.000
<v Speaker 6>many of the German veterans of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>inconclusive,</v>

2569
02:29:11.001 --> 02:29:16.001
<v Speaker 6>though bitter fighting at IPA,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Chappelle artois champagne and loose in </v>

2570
02:29:16.001 --> 02:29:20.141
<v Speaker 6>1915 had survived and stiffened,</v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't army that had been well led at </v>

2571
02:29:20.141 --> 02:29:23.300
<v Speaker 6>the sharp end and remained resolute </v>
<v Speaker 6>against allied efforts in the West.</v>

2572
02:29:23.570 --> 02:29:28.570
<v Speaker 6>It had come close to beating the Russian</v>
<v Speaker 6>armies on the eastern front in that </v>

2573
02:29:28.570 --> 02:29:28.570
<v Speaker 6>year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Also,</v>

2574
02:29:28.570 --> 02:29:30.530
<v Speaker 6>in short,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as John Terrain has noted,</v>

2575
02:29:30.740 --> 02:29:34.370
<v Speaker 6>it must never be forgotten that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>German army of that period was very good</v>

2576
02:29:34.371 --> 02:29:39.371
<v Speaker 6>indeed and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's what you bring to the table.</v>

2577
02:29:40.310 --> 02:29:45.310
<v Speaker 6>Is that enough?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is having the best army in the world </v>

2578
02:29:45.310 --> 02:29:45.920
<v Speaker 6>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And by the way,</v>

2579
02:29:45.921 --> 02:29:49.340
<v Speaker 6>that's something you traditionally think</v>
<v Speaker 6>of when you think of the French,</v>

2580
02:29:49.820 --> 02:29:52.540
<v Speaker 6>but it's safe to say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that since about 18,</v>

2581
02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:57.580
<v Speaker 6>70,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Germans have the best army in the </v>

2582
02:29:57.580 --> 02:29:59.951
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Will that compensate for all the </v>

2583
02:29:59.951 --> 02:30:01.370
<v Speaker 6>downsides of the central powers?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have hard to know.</v>

2584
02:30:01.970 --> 02:30:06.970
<v Speaker 6>One of the worst is the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>left hand and the right hand don't know </v>

2585
02:30:06.970 --> 02:30:07.010
<v Speaker 6>what each other are doing in the central</v>
<v Speaker 6>powers.</v>

2586
02:30:07.310 --> 02:30:09.230
<v Speaker 6>The Austrians go off the reservation all</v>
<v Speaker 6>the time.</v>

2587
02:30:09.231 --> 02:30:11.600
<v Speaker 6>Don't tell anybody what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't get any approval,</v>

2588
02:30:11.601 --> 02:30:15.530
<v Speaker 6>don't work together with anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's a handicap,</v>

2589
02:30:15.531 --> 02:30:20.531
<v Speaker 6>especially when the allies slash entente</v>
<v Speaker 6>forces are pretty darn good at this.</v>

2590
02:30:21.320 --> 02:30:26.320
<v Speaker 6>They have an agreement that they made in</v>
<v Speaker 6>1915 to come to the aid of each other </v>

2591
02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:29.651
<v Speaker 6>when hard pressed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when the Germans launch for done within </v>

2592
02:30:29.651 --> 02:30:32.981
<v Speaker 6>a month,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Russians come riding to the rescue </v>

2593
02:30:32.981 --> 02:30:35.681
<v Speaker 6>in Lithuania trying to help they launch </v>
<v Speaker 6>an offensive that they are clearly not </v>

2594
02:30:35.901 --> 02:30:40.901
<v Speaker 6>ready for and how could you be?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That would be a very short time in this </v>

2595
02:30:40.901 --> 02:30:43.700
<v Speaker 6>period to have planned and stocked up </v>
<v Speaker 6>for and carried out an offensive.</v>

2596
02:30:44.330 --> 02:30:46.180
<v Speaker 6>In March 19,</v>
<v Speaker 6>16,</v>

2597
02:30:46.190 --> 02:30:51.190
<v Speaker 6>the Russians throw human wave attacks at</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Germans and predictably get mowed </v>

2598
02:30:51.741 --> 02:30:52.910
<v Speaker 6>down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Germans,</v>

2599
02:30:53.210 --> 02:30:54.410
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>looking at the corpses,</v>

2600
02:30:54.411 --> 02:30:59.411
<v Speaker 6>thought these people totally untrained </v>
<v Speaker 6>cannon fodder as though the Russians </v>

2601
02:30:59.411 --> 02:31:03.221
<v Speaker 6>were willing to throw tons of human meat</v>
<v Speaker 6>at the Germans simply to scare them </v>

2602
02:31:03.831 --> 02:31:06.260
<v Speaker 6>enough so that they would pull some </v>
<v Speaker 6>units out of redundant,</v>

2603
02:31:06.261 --> 02:31:11.261
<v Speaker 6>takes some pressure off the French.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was so inept that some of the </v>

2604
02:31:11.261 --> 02:31:15.881
<v Speaker 6>casualties the Russian soldiers suffered</v>
<v Speaker 6>were because of being shelled by their </v>

2605
02:31:15.881 --> 02:31:16.220
<v Speaker 6>own sides.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Artillery,</v>

2606
02:31:16.221 --> 02:31:20.460
<v Speaker 6>which is always a tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and 12,000</v>

2607
02:31:20.460 --> 02:31:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Russian soldiers froze in one night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these were wounded,</v>

2608
02:31:25.830 --> 02:31:27.230
<v Speaker 1>bought a bunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were people that just,</v>

2609
02:31:27.270 --> 02:31:32.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're out there in the cold without the </v>

2610
02:31:32.270 --> 02:31:34.101
<v Speaker 1>proper stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Russian logistics are </v>

2611
02:31:34.101 --> 02:31:34.740
<v Speaker 1>traditionally pretty horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in this period.</v>

2612
02:31:35.100 --> 02:31:39.180
<v Speaker 1>It shows you the nature of operations </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2613
02:31:39.181 --> 02:31:43.020
<v Speaker 1>The Russians are not generally thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>of is handling these sorts of things.</v>

2614
02:31:43.021 --> 02:31:48.021
<v Speaker 1>Well and in March 1916,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't handle it well.</v>

2615
02:31:49.530 --> 02:31:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst part probably from the Russian</v>

2616
02:31:53.131 --> 02:31:58.131
<v Speaker 1>perspective though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is they went to all that trouble and it </v>

2617
02:31:58.131 --> 02:31:58.260
<v Speaker 1>didn't take any pressure off the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Verdun.</v>

2618
02:31:59.790 --> 02:32:04.770
<v Speaker 1>The follow up effort though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the Russians on June fourth,</v>

2619
02:32:04.771 --> 02:32:09.771
<v Speaker 1>1916 will be handled much better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprisingly well.</v>

2620
02:32:09.781 --> 02:32:14.781
<v Speaker 1>If you're a guy like Falcon Hein and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've written off with a lot of your </v>

2621
02:32:14.781 --> 02:32:18.471
<v Speaker 1>other generals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any chance the Russians have of doing </v>

2622
02:32:18.471 --> 02:32:20.490
<v Speaker 1>anything significant in 1916 on June </v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth,</v>

2623
02:32:20.491 --> 02:32:25.491
<v Speaker 1>1916,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians do something very </v>

2624
02:32:25.491 --> 02:32:27.591
<v Speaker 1>significant lead by their unquestionably</v>
<v Speaker 1>best general in the first world war.</v>

2625
02:32:28.380 --> 02:32:30.120
<v Speaker 1>A guy named Bruce Hill off.</v>

2626
02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:36.560
<v Speaker 1>We had mentioned in an earlier episode </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Russians simply couldn't </v>

2627
02:32:36.560 --> 02:32:37.320
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were.</v>

2628
02:32:37.350 --> 02:32:40.020
<v Speaker 1>They were okay sometimes on the defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they couldn't attack on.</v>

2629
02:32:40.021 --> 02:32:44.310
<v Speaker 1>The problem is always the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just have such an old fashioned,</v>

2630
02:32:44.311 --> 02:32:49.311
<v Speaker 1>not up to date logistic system that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>farther you moved away from where you </v>

2631
02:32:49.561 --> 02:32:54.561
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the harder it was to get the supplies </v>

2632
02:32:54.561 --> 02:32:56.901
<v Speaker 1>necessary for modern army to run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Brasil of is the most modern </v>

2633
02:32:57.331 --> 02:33:02.331
<v Speaker 1>commander the Russians have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been learning from fighting the </v>

2634
02:33:02.331 --> 02:33:04.500
<v Speaker 1>best army in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Germans all this time,</v>

2635
02:33:04.890 --> 02:33:09.890
<v Speaker 1>and even though he's a cavalry commander</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have a reputation for always </v>

2636
02:33:09.890 --> 02:33:13.011
<v Speaker 1>being sort of old fashioned Bursa love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embraces the new systems out there in </v>

2637
02:33:13.291 --> 02:33:14.610
<v Speaker 1>the new technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

2638
02:33:14.730 --> 02:33:18.150
<v Speaker 1>he does something almost no Russian army</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever does in the first world war.</v>

2639
02:33:18.151 --> 02:33:23.151
<v Speaker 1>He uses aircraft to help as spotters and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to locate positions behind the lines and</v>

2640
02:33:24.121 --> 02:33:29.121
<v Speaker 1>for reconnaissance right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's acting in a much more modern way </v>

2641
02:33:29.121 --> 02:33:33.111
<v Speaker 1>than Russian armies do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember we're talking about an army </v>

2642
02:33:33.111 --> 02:33:36.350
<v Speaker 1>that for the entire length of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>world war will still be wearing cloth </v>

2643
02:33:36.421 --> 02:33:41.421
<v Speaker 1>cap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never get metal helmets during the </v>

2644
02:33:41.421 --> 02:33:44.751
<v Speaker 1>duration of the first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a very old fresh fashioned </v>

2645
02:33:44.751 --> 02:33:47.781
<v Speaker 1>army law of takes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he can do that's modern and uses </v>

2646
02:33:47.781 --> 02:33:47.781
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2647
02:33:49.110 --> 02:33:53.490
<v Speaker 1>He launches his famous offensive named </v>
<v Speaker 1>after him on June fourth,</v>

2648
02:33:53.491 --> 02:33:56.940
<v Speaker 1>and he does so with a very modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>artillery barrage intense but short.</v>

2649
02:33:58.170 --> 02:34:01.860
<v Speaker 1>He's used all sorts of camouflage to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hide his intentions.</v>

2650
02:34:01.861 --> 02:34:06.861
<v Speaker 1>He went as far as painting fake trenches</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the ground behind his lines to </v>

2651
02:34:07.411 --> 02:34:10.920
<v Speaker 1>confuse the Germans and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Austro-hungarian is on the other side.</v>

2652
02:34:13.630 --> 02:34:18.630
<v Speaker 1>And when he launches his attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does so along an enormous front,</v>

2653
02:34:19.780 --> 02:34:21.740
<v Speaker 1>the eastern front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different than the western front,</v>

2654
02:34:21.741 --> 02:34:26.741
<v Speaker 1>and instead of being this really </v>
<v Speaker 1>constrained small area which they can </v>

2655
02:34:26.741 --> 02:34:27.820
<v Speaker 1>build a wall from side to side real </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily,</v>

2656
02:34:27.910 --> 02:34:31.540
<v Speaker 1>it's a huge area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's much more thinly defendant.</v>

2657
02:34:31.541 --> 02:34:36.541
<v Speaker 1>And what [inaudible] does is he attacks </v>
<v Speaker 1>across this giant front with a half </v>

2658
02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:41.020
<v Speaker 1>million men intending to break upon the </v>
<v Speaker 1>defenses of the central powers,</v>

2659
02:34:41.021 --> 02:34:46.021
<v Speaker 1>like a way of breaks on a breakwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And knowing that in many places his </v>

2660
02:34:46.021 --> 02:34:49.720
<v Speaker 1>forces will get pushed backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But where he meets weakness,</v>

2661
02:34:49.721 --> 02:34:54.721
<v Speaker 1>they should burst through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the way writer Gj Meyer explains </v>

2662
02:34:54.721 --> 02:34:59.580
<v Speaker 1>what happens on June fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within hours after the artillery </v>

2663
02:35:00.071 --> 02:35:05.071
<v Speaker 1>bombardments starts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have million Russian forces step </v>

2664
02:35:05.071 --> 02:35:08.350
<v Speaker 1>out of their trenches and moved toward </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mostly Austro-hungarian lines,</v>

2665
02:35:08.351 --> 02:35:13.351
<v Speaker 1>but they're a German troops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To quote his infantry when it attacked </v>

2666
02:35:13.351 --> 02:35:15.430
<v Speaker 1>on June fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>found the Austrians and confusion.</v>

2667
02:35:15.700 --> 02:35:19.180
<v Speaker 1>It's advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stunned them with its scope extending as</v>

2668
02:35:19.181 --> 02:35:23.090
<v Speaker 1>it did along the line of more than 250 </v>
<v Speaker 1>miles still loves.</v>

2669
02:35:23.091 --> 02:35:25.240
<v Speaker 1>The idea was that by attacking </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere,</v>

2670
02:35:25.360 --> 02:35:29.200
<v Speaker 1>he was sure to find holes somewhere and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he had moved his reserves,</v>

2671
02:35:29.260 --> 02:35:34.260
<v Speaker 1>scant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though they were close enough to the </v>

2672
02:35:34.260 --> 02:35:35.080
<v Speaker 1>front so that they could exploit </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities as soon as any appeared,</v>

2673
02:35:35.420 --> 02:35:40.420
<v Speaker 1>and he continues quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the result was from the first hour a</v>

2674
02:35:41.651 --> 02:35:46.651
<v Speaker 1>success of almost incredible magnitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Austro-hungarian Fourth Army </v>

2675
02:35:46.651 --> 02:35:50.110
<v Speaker 1>disintegrated when hit 71,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>of its men.</v>

2676
02:35:50.230 --> 02:35:53.440
<v Speaker 1>More than half the army were killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wounded or captured.</v>

2677
02:35:53.680 --> 02:35:58.060
<v Speaker 1>The seventh was wrecked even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely losing 133,000</v>

2678
02:35:58.061 --> 02:36:00.370
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the same almost everywhere.</v>

2679
02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:02.080
<v Speaker 1>After three days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bruce,</v>

2680
02:36:02.090 --> 02:36:05.050
<v Speaker 1>he found himself in possession of </v>
<v Speaker 1>300,000</v>

2681
02:36:05.051 --> 02:36:08.920
<v Speaker 1>prisoners before the end of the week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than half of the Austrian defenders</v>

2682
02:36:08.921 --> 02:36:13.921
<v Speaker 1>had become casualties and quote Brasil </v>
<v Speaker 1>have shattered the Austrians,</v>

2683
02:36:16.810 --> 02:36:19.270
<v Speaker 1>and then he ran into the typical </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

2684
02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Any Russian commander runs into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inability of the Russian army in </v>

2685
02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:29.251
<v Speaker 1>government to get him enough stuff fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough for him to not slow down and have</v>

2686
02:36:29.411 --> 02:36:30.730
<v Speaker 1>his offensive Peter out.</v>

2687
02:36:31.540 --> 02:36:36.540
<v Speaker 1>But this maneuver had a domino effect on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war because at Verdun Falcon Hein </v>

2688
02:36:39.690 --> 02:36:44.690
<v Speaker 1>now had a crisis on his hands in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>east where he was going to have to pull </v>

2689
02:36:44.690 --> 02:36:47.950
<v Speaker 1>troops out of Verdun to go save the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Austro-hungarian army,</v>

2690
02:36:47.951 --> 02:36:52.951
<v Speaker 1>which was disintegrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let's understand the </v>

2691
02:36:52.951 --> 02:36:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Austro-hungarian forces we told you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about those,</v>

2692
02:36:54.220 --> 02:36:59.220
<v Speaker 1>those troops who were a microcosm of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>empire as a whole who didn't want to be </v>

2693
02:36:59.220 --> 02:37:04.021
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had whole units and I mean </v>

2694
02:37:04.021 --> 02:37:07.140
<v Speaker 1>battalions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regiments of slobs throw down their </v>

2695
02:37:07.140 --> 02:37:11.311
<v Speaker 1>weapons and surrender to the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who by the way are Slavs to let us not </v>

2696
02:37:11.311 --> 02:37:14.971
<v Speaker 1>forget that this war began when a slavic</v>
<v Speaker 1>national assassinated austro-hungarian </v>

2697
02:37:16.521 --> 02:37:17.720
<v Speaker 1>heir to the throne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2698
02:37:17.900 --> 02:37:21.740
<v Speaker 1>And now we're asking slavs to fight for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that empire.</v>

2699
02:37:22.010 --> 02:37:24.560
<v Speaker 1>Many of them threw down their weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to die,</v>

2700
02:37:24.561 --> 02:37:26.600
<v Speaker 1>and they certainly do more die fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that empire,</v>

2701
02:37:26.750 --> 02:37:31.750
<v Speaker 1>and they certainly didn't want to die </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting for that empire against their </v>

2702
02:37:31.750 --> 02:37:31.910
<v Speaker 1>Slavic brethren.</v>

2703
02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:37.240
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these units are said to have </v>

2704
02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:37.240
<v Speaker 1>jumped into the trenches with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians,</v>

2705
02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:39.860
<v Speaker 1>turned around and trained their guns </v>
<v Speaker 1>back on the side.</v>

2706
02:37:39.861 --> 02:37:44.861
<v Speaker 1>They had just defected from the Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will manage to contain with their </v>

2707
02:37:44.901 --> 02:37:46.820
<v Speaker 1>wonderful army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russian threat,</v>

2708
02:37:47.450 --> 02:37:50.960
<v Speaker 1>and they will halt mercy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loves advance,</v>

2709
02:37:50.961 --> 02:37:55.961
<v Speaker 1>and even deal a defeat to the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but already the single minded focus of </v>

2710
02:37:57.620 --> 02:37:59.750
<v Speaker 1>falcon heights on Verdun has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>shattered.</v>

2711
02:38:00.110 --> 02:38:05.110
<v Speaker 1>The Russians who put in such a wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort in the brewster love offensive </v>

2712
02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:08.771
<v Speaker 1>and did such terrible damage to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Austrians suffered immensely though </v>

2713
02:38:08.771 --> 02:38:13.031
<v Speaker 1>while doing so well over a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties suffered in the brewery love </v>

2714
02:38:13.031 --> 02:38:17.860
<v Speaker 1>offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which once again takes the Russians and </v>

2715
02:38:17.860 --> 02:38:20.630
<v Speaker 1>begins to ratchet up the level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissatisfaction,</v>

2716
02:38:20.900 --> 02:38:23.780
<v Speaker 1>getting them closer and closer to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking point.</v>

2717
02:38:23.781 --> 02:38:26.780
<v Speaker 1>You can almost feel it in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1916,</v>

2718
02:38:27.020 --> 02:38:32.020
<v Speaker 1>a couple of these major powers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>within one good punch of going down in </v>

2719
02:38:33.051 --> 02:38:37.010
<v Speaker 1>the spring of 1916.</v>
<v Speaker 1>French military leader,</v>

2720
02:38:37.011 --> 02:38:42.011
<v Speaker 1>Joseph you offer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tells his British counterpart that </v>

2721
02:38:42.011 --> 02:38:42.290
<v Speaker 1>France is one of those nations</v>

2722
02:38:43.860 --> 02:38:46.350
<v Speaker 1>within a good shot of going down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

2723
02:38:46.750 --> 02:38:49.380
<v Speaker 1>you know by this time they've had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month or two at Verdun.</v>

2724
02:38:49.381 --> 02:38:54.381
<v Speaker 1>The French have suffered like 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties and at least this early two </v>

2725
02:38:55.201 --> 02:38:57.840
<v Speaker 1>months into 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody knows it yet.</v>

2726
02:38:57.841 --> 02:38:59.760
<v Speaker 1>At the battle of redundant looks like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the German leader,</v>

2727
02:38:59.761 --> 02:39:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Falcon Heinz plan to bleed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The French army white is working.</v>

2728
02:39:03.540 --> 02:39:06.000
<v Speaker 1>That's why you can't take your eyes off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first world war.</v>

2729
02:39:06.001 --> 02:39:11.001
<v Speaker 1>They're like two prize fighters and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think one guy's taken over the </v>

2730
02:39:11.001 --> 02:39:11.001
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other guidelines,</v>

2731
02:39:11.001 --> 02:39:13.320
<v Speaker 1>a good shot and somebodies knees buckle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the spring of Nineteen 16,</v>

2732
02:39:13.321 --> 02:39:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer tells Sir Douglas Haig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the current commander of British forces,</v>

2733
02:39:18.170 --> 02:39:23.170
<v Speaker 1>it's France whose knees had been buckled</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he urges Hague to start that summer </v>

2734
02:39:23.521 --> 02:39:27.180
<v Speaker 1>offensive that he's been planning for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time on the river somme early.</v>

2735
02:39:27.650 --> 02:39:29.190
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't start it early,</v>

2736
02:39:29.550 --> 02:39:34.240
<v Speaker 1>the French army will cease to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets so worked up.</v>

2737
02:39:34.241 --> 02:39:39.241
<v Speaker 1>We're told that he can only be consoled </v>
<v Speaker 1>and calmed down with lots of 1840 </v>

2738
02:39:40.421 --> 02:39:41.440
<v Speaker 1>brandy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2739
02:39:41.441 --> 02:39:46.441
<v Speaker 1>from the year 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 chauffeur needed good brandy to calm </v>

2740
02:39:46.441 --> 02:39:46.441
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

2741
02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haig speeds up the big offensive plan </v>

2742
02:39:52.781 --> 02:39:57.781
<v Speaker 1>for the summer of 1916.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Discussed with all the other allies in </v>

2743
02:39:57.781 --> 02:40:01.441
<v Speaker 1>late 1915,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a longterm plan and the going </v>

2744
02:40:01.441 --> 02:40:04.710
<v Speaker 1>gonna launch it early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This longterm plan results in the most </v>

2745
02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:09.550
<v Speaker 1>controversial piece from the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>standpoint of this whole war,</v>

2746
02:40:09.551 --> 02:40:13.360
<v Speaker 1>maybe of British military history in its</v>
<v Speaker 1>entirety.</v>

2747
02:40:14.130 --> 02:40:15.900
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Haig,</v>

2748
02:40:15.901 --> 02:40:20.901
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand that the field </v>
<v Speaker 1>marshal the Java was talking to is the </v>

2749
02:40:20.901 --> 02:40:24.441
<v Speaker 1>new guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like most of the great powers in </v>

2750
02:40:24.441 --> 02:40:25.980
<v Speaker 1>the first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By 1916,</v>

2751
02:40:25.981 --> 02:40:28.590
<v Speaker 1>they fired the person that got them into</v>
<v Speaker 1>this mess,</v>

2752
02:40:28.591 --> 02:40:30.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wars terrible.</v>

2753
02:40:30.750 --> 02:40:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's predictions were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's fighting it well,</v>

2754
02:40:34.201 --> 02:40:39.201
<v Speaker 1>so one by one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these countries are sac in the </v>

2755
02:40:39.201 --> 02:40:39.201
<v Speaker 1>people that got them into this mess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians dropped.</v>

2756
02:40:39.201 --> 02:40:43.311
<v Speaker 1>There's the Germans have falcon heights </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they got rid of unmold killed </v>

2757
02:40:43.311 --> 02:40:43.311
<v Speaker 1>while the war was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2758
02:40:43.311 --> 02:40:47.600
<v Speaker 1>in its early phases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French still have shopped for a </v>

2759
02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:47.600
<v Speaker 1>crazily enough.</v>

2760
02:40:47.850 --> 02:40:48.900
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2761
02:40:48.901 --> 02:40:53.730
<v Speaker 1>that reputation of the miracle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in 1914 will only carry you so far.</v>

2762
02:40:53.731 --> 02:40:58.731
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have long to go either and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the British in late 1950 and Sir John </v>

2763
02:40:58.890 --> 02:41:00.030
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we told you in the last episode,</v>

2764
02:41:00.240 --> 02:41:02.820
<v Speaker 1>the guy who gets his gig is a guy named </v>
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Haig.</v>

2765
02:41:03.390 --> 02:41:08.390
<v Speaker 1>It'll be a field marshal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's another one of these cavalry </v>

2766
02:41:08.390 --> 02:41:08.390
<v Speaker 1>commanders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was weird.</v>

2767
02:41:08.390 --> 02:41:13.281
<v Speaker 1>We have a war where cavalry becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you keep off to the side </v>

2768
02:41:13.281 --> 02:41:15.270
<v Speaker 1>and don't use because it just gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed and the horses are more important</v>

2769
02:41:15.271 --> 02:41:20.271
<v Speaker 1>to move stuff because crazily enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we haven't talked enough about this </v>

2770
02:41:20.271 --> 02:41:22.260
<v Speaker 1>and we'll get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horses are everywhere.</v>

2771
02:41:22.261 --> 02:41:26.130
<v Speaker 1>There's millions of them in this war and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their casualties too,</v>

2772
02:41:26.131 --> 02:41:29.280
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all these cavalry commanders,</v>

2773
02:41:29.281 --> 02:41:30.180
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey golf,</v>

2774
02:41:30.190 --> 02:41:35.190
<v Speaker 1>these guys have these visions that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to break the German lines </v>

2775
02:41:35.190 --> 02:41:38.831
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and then the cavalry is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go rushing in the hole we create and </v>

2776
02:41:38.831 --> 02:41:38.831
<v Speaker 1>go into the back.</v>

2777
02:41:38.831 --> 02:41:40.130
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the pre,</v>

2778
02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:42.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wehrmacht Armor,</v>

2779
02:41:42.481 --> 02:41:47.481
<v Speaker 1>Blitzkrieg version of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a strategy that's been used </v>

2780
02:41:47.481 --> 02:41:47.481
<v Speaker 1>throughout history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2781
02:41:47.790 --> 02:41:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes back to pre Alexander time,</v>

2782
02:41:51.311 --> 02:41:53.850
<v Speaker 1>smashed the cavalry into the hole and </v>
<v Speaker 1>roll up the lines.</v>

2783
02:41:53.940 --> 02:41:55.950
<v Speaker 1>It's blitzkrieg before you have motor </v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicles,</v>

2784
02:41:55.951 --> 02:41:59.520
<v Speaker 1>and that's what these cavalry commanders</v>
<v Speaker 1>are still dreaming of two years into the</v>

2785
02:41:59.521 --> 02:42:02.360
<v Speaker 1>war that puts the final nail into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffin,</v>

2786
02:42:02.361 --> 02:42:06.570
<v Speaker 1>into the idea that this cavalry has any </v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive role to play.</v>

2787
02:42:07.620 --> 02:42:12.620
<v Speaker 1>Although you have to remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still is the fastest moving thing on </v>

2788
02:42:12.620 --> 02:42:12.620
<v Speaker 1>the battlefield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In large numbers,</v>

2789
02:42:12.620 --> 02:42:14.750
<v Speaker 1>you're starting to get motor vehicles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2790
02:42:14.820 --> 02:42:17.730
<v Speaker 1>tough for the motor vehicles to handle </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrain and they're very unreliable.</v>

2791
02:42:17.731 --> 02:42:20.160
<v Speaker 1>Horses are still the fastest mobility </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

2792
02:42:20.161 --> 02:42:22.890
<v Speaker 1>so they're valuable just for that point </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

2793
02:42:22.891 --> 02:42:25.860
<v Speaker 1>They're very vulnerable though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the stories of,</v>

2794
02:42:26.010 --> 02:42:31.010
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of dead horses in the suffering of </v>

2795
02:42:31.010 --> 02:42:32.820
<v Speaker 1>animals in the story is under discussed.</v>

2796
02:42:33.870 --> 02:42:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Haig,</v>

2797
02:42:35.251 --> 02:42:37.870
<v Speaker 1>the new British cavalry commander,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2798
02:42:38.100 --> 02:42:43.100
<v Speaker 1>has at his disposal some of the largest </v>
<v Speaker 1>really the largest armies that Britain </v>

2799
02:42:43.100 --> 02:42:47.661
<v Speaker 1>has ever had ready to go to war because </v>
<v Speaker 1>those volunteers that started joining </v>

2800
02:42:48.001 --> 02:42:53.001
<v Speaker 1>when Lord Horacio Kitchener,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll remember the British military </v>

2801
02:42:53.001 --> 02:42:53.280
<v Speaker 1>leader from the beginning of the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy who,</v>

2802
02:42:53.281 --> 02:42:55.470
<v Speaker 1>when you see his picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>screams,</v>

2803
02:42:55.471 --> 02:42:57.990
<v Speaker 1>19th century man on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2804
02:42:58.190 --> 02:43:03.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the giant mustache from another </v>

2805
02:43:03.190 --> 02:43:04.941
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can almost see him in a British red </v>

2806
02:43:04.941 --> 02:43:06.831
<v Speaker 1>coat and he's the big face on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>recruiting poster telling Britain's </v>

2807
02:43:06.831 --> 02:43:10.700
<v Speaker 1>patriotic Britain's to sign up for king </v>
<v Speaker 1>and country and a shilling and kitchen </v>

2808
02:43:10.700 --> 02:43:14.720
<v Speaker 1>is another one of these prewar early war</v>
<v Speaker 1>generals and military leaders who's been</v>

2809
02:43:14.831 --> 02:43:16.410
<v Speaker 1>tarred by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2810
02:43:16.750 --> 02:43:18.250
<v Speaker 1>their conduct in the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

2811
02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:23.280
<v Speaker 1>they don't end up looking so genius like</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the first world war gets done with </v>

2812
02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:23.280
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2813
02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:25.330
<v Speaker 1>So as kitchener,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his reputation is starting to wane.</v>

2814
02:43:25.331 --> 02:43:30.331
<v Speaker 1>He still got one real feather in his cap</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's that those armies that he </v>

2815
02:43:30.331 --> 02:43:35.221
<v Speaker 1>helped recruit in 1914 in 1915 and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he is protected like a proud parent,</v>

2816
02:43:35.810 --> 02:43:37.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't send them to Gullapalli.</v>

2817
02:43:37.031 --> 02:43:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Don't send him to the western front </v>
<v Speaker 1>early.</v>

2818
02:43:38.381 --> 02:43:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Don't throw them in the meat grinder </v>
<v Speaker 1>like everything else,</v>

2819
02:43:40.871 --> 02:43:44.290
<v Speaker 1>save them and really make use of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriotic contribution.</v>

2820
02:43:44.291 --> 02:43:49.291
<v Speaker 1>These people want to win the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put them in a position where they </v>

2821
02:43:49.291 --> 02:43:51.871
<v Speaker 1>can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's done an admirable job of that in </v>

2822
02:43:51.871 --> 02:43:54.571
<v Speaker 1>about three weeks before those soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 1>known sometimes as the kitchen or armies</v>

2823
02:43:54.761 --> 02:43:59.761
<v Speaker 1>or the kitchen or divisions after him </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to lose the guy that was </v>

2824
02:43:59.761 --> 02:44:03.370
<v Speaker 1>probably most responsible for seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they weren't used up already in the</v>

2825
02:44:03.371 --> 02:44:08.371
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kitchener dies about three weeks before </v>

2826
02:44:08.371 --> 02:44:08.371
<v Speaker 1>his legions are thrown into the frame.</v>

2827
02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:14.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm told that it is the same as any one </v>

2828
02:44:14.351 --> 02:44:19.351
<v Speaker 1>of those big modern deaths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so so the same as a princess or lady </v>

2829
02:44:19.351 --> 02:44:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Diana dying or Winston Churchill dying </v>
<v Speaker 1>or JFK dying in the United States.</v>

2830
02:44:22.781 --> 02:44:24.760
<v Speaker 1>You say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember when that happened?</v>

2831
02:44:24.761 --> 02:44:27.340
<v Speaker 1>And Britain's of the period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember where they were when they heard</v>

2832
02:44:27.670 --> 02:44:32.670
<v Speaker 1>that Lord Horacio Kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're British military leader and </v>

2833
02:44:32.670 --> 02:44:34.090
<v Speaker 1>almost Demi God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least at the beginning of the war,</v>

2834
02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:39.360
<v Speaker 1>has gone down at sea while on a war ship</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the way to Russia on some military </v>

2835
02:44:40.271 --> 02:44:45.271
<v Speaker 1>mission and the boat goes down at night </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a force nine gail after hitting a </v>

2836
02:44:48.161 --> 02:44:51.730
<v Speaker 1>mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are survivors who say,</v>

2837
02:44:51.731 --> 02:44:56.731
<v Speaker 1>take this with a grain of salt that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw kitchener on the deck as the ship </v>

2838
02:44:56.731 --> 02:45:00.991
<v Speaker 1>went down in passively sort of accepting</v>
<v Speaker 1>his fate and just standing on the deck </v>

2839
02:45:00.991 --> 02:45:00.991
<v Speaker 1>as the ship goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2840
02:45:00.991 --> 02:45:05.940
<v Speaker 1>beneath the waves that really works with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole 19th century military leader </v>

2841
02:45:05.940 --> 02:45:06.430
<v Speaker 1>reputation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

2842
02:45:06.970 --> 02:45:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been conspiracy theories ever</v>

2843
02:45:09.281 --> 02:45:11.650
<v Speaker 1>since about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not,</v>

2844
02:45:11.950 --> 02:45:16.950
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the Great Conspiracy Know </v>
<v Speaker 1>Fountain heads to come out of the first </v>

2845
02:45:16.950 --> 02:45:16.990
<v Speaker 1>world war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

2846
02:45:16.991 --> 02:45:19.060
<v Speaker 1>it meant the three weeks later when </v>
<v Speaker 1>kitchener's,</v>

2847
02:45:19.190 --> 02:45:24.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parentally preserved armies are finally </v>

2848
02:45:24.190 --> 02:45:25.660
<v Speaker 1>thrown into the fray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not there to have any say in it.</v>

2849
02:45:26.740 --> 02:45:31.740
<v Speaker 1>The Guy who is is Douglas Haig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new guy now known to some in history</v>

2850
02:45:32.861 --> 02:45:37.861
<v Speaker 1>as the butcher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that should give you an idea of what </v>

2851
02:45:37.861 --> 02:45:40.000
<v Speaker 1>we're about to get into here on a wide </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of fronts.</v>

2852
02:45:41.140 --> 02:45:46.140
<v Speaker 1>This battle is won that Sir Douglas Haig</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been preparing for since the year </v>

2853
02:45:46.541 --> 02:45:51.541
<v Speaker 1>before when the French told him that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were in danger of disintegrating.</v>

2854
02:45:51.940 --> 02:45:56.940
<v Speaker 1>He's moving up something he's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on for awhile now and everyone </v>

2855
02:45:56.940 --> 02:46:00.961
<v Speaker 1>knows it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big 1916 offensive is no secret.</v>

2856
02:46:01.421 --> 02:46:06.421
<v Speaker 1>Hekaton newspapers basically means that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you find out all the ways that </v>

2857
02:46:06.421 --> 02:46:10.981
<v Speaker 1>everybody knew this was coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you wonder again how </v>

2858
02:46:10.981 --> 02:46:14.891
<v Speaker 1>intelligent it is to be launching </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that everybody knows is </v>

2859
02:46:14.891 --> 02:46:14.891
<v Speaker 1>coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it couldn't really be helped.</v>

2860
02:46:14.891 --> 02:46:19.400
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to fight at this spot on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Somme River with the British and the</v>

2861
02:46:19.401 --> 02:46:24.401
<v Speaker 1>French forces meet on the western front </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the where the British line ends </v>

2862
02:46:24.401 --> 02:46:28.721
<v Speaker 1>and the French line begins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where they're going to hold this </v>

2863
02:46:28.721 --> 02:46:31.541
<v Speaker 1>joint offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe for the sole reason that that's </v>

2864
02:46:31.541 --> 02:46:34.871
<v Speaker 1>where both armies are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a really silly reason to </v>

2865
02:46:34.871 --> 02:46:37.910
<v Speaker 1>attack the greatest defenses on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>western front,</v>

2866
02:46:37.911 --> 02:46:40.910
<v Speaker 1>which are the greatest defenses ever in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world right now.</v>

2867
02:46:40.911 --> 02:46:42.830
<v Speaker 1>These are defenses that make the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>Roman,</v>

2868
02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:44.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2869
02:46:44.061 --> 02:46:48.620
<v Speaker 1>lines that you would cross Europe with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these giant wall miner.</v>

2870
02:46:49.300 --> 02:46:54.300
<v Speaker 1>It has never been defensive like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Germans are at the point now where </v>

2871
02:46:54.300 --> 02:46:57.140
<v Speaker 1>they're building creature comforts into </v>
<v Speaker 1>their fortified line.</v>

2872
02:46:57.141 --> 02:46:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're putting wallpaper on and they've</v>

2873
02:46:59.121 --> 02:47:02.180
<v Speaker 1>got electric lights and ventilation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then no running water.</v>

2874
02:47:02.181 --> 02:47:07.181
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trenches or in some cases all lined </v>

2875
02:47:07.181 --> 02:47:10.421
<v Speaker 1>with wood boards done with about as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>thorough on this as the Germans are </v>

2876
02:47:10.421 --> 02:47:10.421
<v Speaker 1>known for.</v>

2877
02:47:10.421 --> 02:47:13.130
<v Speaker 1>These are huge modern fortifications in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>

2878
02:47:13.131 --> 02:47:18.131
<v Speaker 1>And these Germans on the other side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this line where the French and the </v>

2879
02:47:18.131 --> 02:47:21.071
<v Speaker 1>British are thinking about launching </v>
<v Speaker 1>this big 1916 offensive have bunkers </v>

2880
02:47:21.071 --> 02:47:24.851
<v Speaker 1>that are 30 and 40 feet underground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut into the chalk of these hills that </v>

2881
02:47:26.451 --> 02:47:31.451
<v Speaker 1>the Germans occupied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are looking down for months as the </v>

2882
02:47:31.581 --> 02:47:36.581
<v Speaker 1>British load up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the stuff you now need for a modern </v>

2883
02:47:36.581 --> 02:47:36.581
<v Speaker 1>offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that stuff.</v>

2884
02:47:36.581 --> 02:47:37.520
<v Speaker 1>We said that the German's needed at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Verdun,</v>

2885
02:47:37.910 --> 02:47:39.380
<v Speaker 1>the British need at the Somme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2886
02:47:39.381 --> 02:47:40.460
<v Speaker 1>The French too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

2887
02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:44.410
<v Speaker 1>They've laid five railroad lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2888
02:47:44.420 --> 02:47:48.560
<v Speaker 1>new tracks to the battlefield because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how often and how many trains are</v>

2889
02:47:48.561 --> 02:47:52.310
<v Speaker 1>going to be running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just unloading stuff for months,</v>

2890
02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:54.710
<v Speaker 1>$3,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million shells,</v>

2891
02:47:54.980 --> 02:47:59.980
<v Speaker 1>millions of tons of food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean crazy in engineering corps that </v>

2892
02:47:59.980 --> 02:48:00.890
<v Speaker 1>are building things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2893
02:48:00.891 --> 02:48:05.891
<v Speaker 1>full on permanent structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the Germans watched the whole </v>

2894
02:48:05.891 --> 02:48:06.560
<v Speaker 1>thing and plan for it and trained for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2895
02:48:06.830 --> 02:48:08.090
<v Speaker 1>they're having drills every day.</v>

2896
02:48:08.610 --> 02:48:13.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how quickly can we get up from our </v>

2897
02:48:13.610 --> 02:48:15.401
<v Speaker 1>underground bunker and get up to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trench and man the machine guns before </v>

2898
02:48:15.401 --> 02:48:15.401
<v Speaker 1>the British soldiers are on top of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2899
02:48:15.401 --> 02:48:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows this is coming and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows how it's going to be </v>

2900
02:48:20.170 --> 02:48:21.860
<v Speaker 1>fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British take these armies with many,</v>

2901
02:48:21.861 --> 02:48:24.020
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many green troops that had never been in</v>

2902
02:48:24.021 --> 02:48:27.050
<v Speaker 1>a battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts them in the trenches opposite these</v>

2903
02:48:27.051 --> 02:48:29.330
<v Speaker 1>German lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2904
02:48:29.390 --> 02:48:34.390
<v Speaker 1>a position so strong that Winston </v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill says it was undoubtedly the </v>

2905
02:48:35.781 --> 02:48:40.781
<v Speaker 1>strongest and most perfectly defended </v>
<v Speaker 1>position in the world and the quote,</v>

2906
02:48:42.680 --> 02:48:47.270
<v Speaker 1>and start bombarding it with artillery </v>
<v Speaker 1>starts June 20,</v>

2907
02:48:47.271 --> 02:48:47.900
<v Speaker 1>fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

2908
02:48:47.901 --> 02:48:48.740
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early.</v>

2909
02:48:48.741 --> 02:48:51.920
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of artillery.</v>

2910
02:48:52.850 --> 02:48:57.850
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the song becomes one of about four or </v>

2911
02:48:57.850 --> 02:49:00.641
<v Speaker 1>five first world war battles that </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete for like the Guinness Book of </v>

2912
02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:03.050
<v Speaker 1>World Records for the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>largest,</v>

2913
02:49:03.051 --> 02:49:04.370
<v Speaker 1>worst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more intense,</v>

2914
02:49:04.371 --> 02:49:05.360
<v Speaker 1>most numerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2915
02:49:05.450 --> 02:49:08.190
<v Speaker 1>pick your category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>artillery bombardment of the war</v>

2916
02:49:09.860 --> 02:49:10.540
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2917
02:49:10.570 --> 02:49:15.570
<v Speaker 1>as a history geek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be arguing it with my other </v>

2918
02:49:15.570 --> 02:49:15.570
<v Speaker 1>history geek friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2919
02:49:15.570 --> 02:49:15.570
<v Speaker 1>and it's always about criteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2920
02:49:15.570 --> 02:49:20.401
<v Speaker 1>Are we talking about the largest number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of shells fall throughout an entire </v>

2921
02:49:20.401 --> 02:49:20.401
<v Speaker 1>battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2922
02:49:20.401 --> 02:49:24.241
<v Speaker 1>40 to 60 million of verdun maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or are we talking about the most number </v>

2923
02:49:24.241 --> 02:49:28.081
<v Speaker 1>of shells used in the initial part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the battle or the most number of shells </v>

2924
02:49:28.081 --> 02:49:29.740
<v Speaker 1>dropped in the shortest period of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the smallest space.</v>

2925
02:49:29.741 --> 02:49:34.741
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's literally a measurement of how </v>

2926
02:49:34.741 --> 02:49:36.460
<v Speaker 1>many tons of shells fell on each square </v>
<v Speaker 1>meter of these battlefields.</v>

2927
02:49:36.461 --> 02:49:41.461
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you use that as your criterion for </v>

2928
02:49:41.461 --> 02:49:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Dunn is the worst artillery bombardment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2929
02:49:43.840 --> 02:49:45.820
<v Speaker 1>in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

2930
02:49:45.821 --> 02:49:50.821
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the psalm is in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument shows you the level of </v>

2931
02:49:50.821 --> 02:49:52.900
<v Speaker 1>artillery we're talking about here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when it opens up on the 24th,</v>

2932
02:49:53.950 --> 02:49:56.200
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's incredible and it's volume,</v>

2933
02:49:56.201 --> 02:49:57.760
<v Speaker 1>but the Germans laugh a little.</v>

2934
02:49:58.840 --> 02:50:03.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a huge bombardment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Germans are mostly underground </v>

2935
02:50:03.840 --> 02:50:05.800
<v Speaker 1>and under cover and most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombardment is,</v>

2936
02:50:05.801 --> 02:50:07.960
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shrapnel shells,</v>

2937
02:50:08.050 --> 02:50:11.740
<v Speaker 1>sounds like a little teeny point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it for a battle to turn on,</v>

2938
02:50:12.160 --> 02:50:14.980
<v Speaker 1>but had those shells been high explosive</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead,</v>

2939
02:50:14.981 --> 02:50:18.880
<v Speaker 1>or maybe even gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this battle may go another direction and</v>

2940
02:50:18.881 --> 02:50:22.510
<v Speaker 1>every historian brings up that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shrapnel was pretty much pointless.</v>

2941
02:50:23.880 --> 02:50:28.880
<v Speaker 1>It's remember it's like a giant hand </v>
<v Speaker 1>grenade or shotgun shell exploding in </v>

2942
02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:28.900
<v Speaker 1>the air and all these little pellets hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>

2943
02:50:28.901 --> 02:50:30.910
<v Speaker 1>It's devastating to infantry out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>open,</v>

2944
02:50:30.911 --> 02:50:32.350
<v Speaker 1>but the Germans aren't in the open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2945
02:50:33.580 --> 02:50:38.580
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the artillery is meant to do more than </v>

2946
02:50:38.580 --> 02:50:41.251
<v Speaker 1>just killed Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The artillery has to clear the </v>

2947
02:50:41.251 --> 02:50:44.881
<v Speaker 1>battlefield of all this stuff that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>there as defenses so that the troops on </v>

2948
02:50:44.881 --> 02:50:47.080
<v Speaker 1>the British side can actually get to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>German trenches.</v>

2949
02:50:47.470 --> 02:50:50.680
<v Speaker 1>It's full of barbed wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Man's land,</v>

2950
02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:54.370
<v Speaker 1>another trench than another no man's </v>
<v Speaker 1>land than another trench.</v>

2951
02:50:54.550 --> 02:50:59.550
<v Speaker 1>The trenches are all going uphill and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these no man's land areas besides being </v>

2952
02:50:59.550 --> 02:51:01.930
<v Speaker 1>filled with concrete bunkers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything we've told you about before,</v>

2953
02:51:01.931 --> 02:51:06.070
<v Speaker 1>the killing zones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have yards of barbed wires thick as</v>

2954
02:51:06.071 --> 02:51:06.640
<v Speaker 1>your finger.</v>

2955
02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:11.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a physical impediment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be overcome by the generals.</v>

2956
02:51:11.840 --> 02:51:16.840
<v Speaker 1>The generals have figured out in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>minds that an artillery barrage of this </v>

2957
02:51:16.840 --> 02:51:18.410
<v Speaker 1>caliber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amounts we're talking about here,</v>

2958
02:51:18.560 --> 02:51:21.140
<v Speaker 1>the barb wire will just explode into </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces.</v>

2959
02:51:21.170 --> 02:51:23.990
<v Speaker 1>They will not be an impediment when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>artillery barrages over,</v>

2960
02:51:24.210 --> 02:51:26.600
<v Speaker 1>except the shrapnel shells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really affect it.</v>

2961
02:51:28.440 --> 02:51:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a benefit to the artillery </v>

2962
02:51:33.440 --> 02:51:33.480
<v Speaker 1>barrage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though as we've quoted before,</v>

2963
02:51:33.481 --> 02:51:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon has this great line that comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in handy all the time.</v>

2964
02:51:36.181 --> 02:51:41.181
<v Speaker 1>That quantity has a quality all its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sheer intensity of this barrage </v>

2965
02:51:41.731 --> 02:51:46.731
<v Speaker 1>began to have an effect on the Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they were physically </v>

2966
02:51:46.731 --> 02:51:48.930
<v Speaker 1>protected from being injured by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It began to play on them.</v>

2967
02:51:48.931 --> 02:51:53.931
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know they've got something really </v>

2968
02:51:53.931 --> 02:51:55.140
<v Speaker 1>nasty awaiting them in their future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to try to put yourself in their</v>

2969
02:51:55.141 --> 02:51:56.160
<v Speaker 1>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

2970
02:51:56.730 --> 02:52:01.730
<v Speaker 1>They know that when this artillery </v>
<v Speaker 1>barrages over the British are going to </v>

2971
02:52:01.730 --> 02:52:05.661
<v Speaker 1>be on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been training for this moment </v>

2972
02:52:05.661 --> 02:52:05.661
<v Speaker 1>for months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2973
02:52:05.661 --> 02:52:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Run up the stairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How quickly can you get in front of the</v>

2974
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:10.980
<v Speaker 6>machine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>gun in time to stop the British from </v>

2975
02:52:10.980 --> 02:52:11.410
<v Speaker 6>taking over your trench so they're going</v>
<v Speaker 6>to either be killed,</v>

2976
02:52:11.610 --> 02:52:16.610
<v Speaker 6>bee grievously wounded,</v>
<v Speaker 6>see a friend killed or wounded or have </v>

2977
02:52:16.610 --> 02:52:17.920
<v Speaker 6>to kill some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're going to have a really nasty day</v>

2978
02:52:17.921 --> 02:52:20.680
<v Speaker 6>and they're very near future.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In the meantime,</v>

2979
02:52:20.830 --> 02:52:25.830
<v Speaker 6>you're going to have one of the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 6>artillery barrages and history going on </v>

2980
02:52:25.830 --> 02:52:29.520
<v Speaker 6>around you or younger who will be at </v>
<v Speaker 6>this battlefield in about a month and </v>

2981
02:52:29.520 --> 02:52:32.080
<v Speaker 6>see a an artillery barrage that is not </v>
<v Speaker 6>as bad as this one.</v>

2982
02:52:32.710 --> 02:52:35.320
<v Speaker 6>He will compare it to the roar of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>ocean.</v>

2983
02:52:36.310 --> 02:52:40.180
<v Speaker 6>He will say that there are no individual</v>
<v Speaker 6>sounds and he says he will.</v>

2984
02:52:40.270 --> 02:52:42.820
<v Speaker 6>It will achieve at times and last for </v>
<v Speaker 6>hours.</v>

2985
02:52:42.850 --> 02:52:47.350
<v Speaker 6>A demented intensity that he says when </v>
<v Speaker 6>it eventually calms down,</v>

2986
02:52:47.740 --> 02:52:51.550
<v Speaker 6>calms down to mere drum fire,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is,</v>

2987
02:52:51.551 --> 02:52:53.620
<v Speaker 6>you know the sound of a drum roll.</v>

2988
02:52:53.620 --> 02:52:55.270
<v Speaker 6>That's how fast the artillery shells are</v>
<v Speaker 6>dropping,</v>

2989
02:52:55.271 --> 02:52:56.800
<v Speaker 6>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even when it's the drum roll,</v>

2990
02:52:56.801 --> 02:52:59.530
<v Speaker 6>you can't pick out any individual </v>
<v Speaker 6>explosions.</v>

2991
02:52:59.531 --> 02:53:04.531
<v Speaker 6>It's just one big loud sound,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the demented theory that it reaches </v>

2992
02:53:04.531 --> 02:53:07.981
<v Speaker 6>sometimes blows that away literally.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's the kind of intensity these </v>

2993
02:53:08.321 --> 02:53:13.321
<v Speaker 6>soldiers are living with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>knowing that they've got this horrible </v>

2994
02:53:13.321 --> 02:53:15.811
<v Speaker 6>moment in their future and it goes on </v>
<v Speaker 6>for days and we're told that the German </v>

2995
02:53:15.811 --> 02:53:20.611
<v Speaker 6>soldiers who were kind of laughing at </v>
<v Speaker 6>the fact that the British were using </v>

2996
02:53:20.611 --> 02:53:22.780
<v Speaker 6>like 70 percent shrapnel shells on them </v>
<v Speaker 6>aren't laughing anymore.</v>

2997
02:53:23.860 --> 02:53:25.750
<v Speaker 6>They're getting tired and stressed and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2998
02:53:25.810 --> 02:53:30.040
<v Speaker 6>put yourself in the position of just not</v>
<v Speaker 6>sleeping for five days and now,</v>

2999
02:53:30.290 --> 02:53:32.620
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>add all the other things on top of that.</v>

3000
02:53:33.280 --> 02:53:35.320
<v Speaker 6>So there is an effect that this </v>
<v Speaker 6>artillery is having.</v>

3001
02:53:35.321 --> 02:53:37.720
<v Speaker 6>And the Germans all right about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3002
02:53:37.750 --> 02:53:40.570
<v Speaker 6>the British commander,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is part of the controversy.</v>

3003
02:53:40.960 --> 02:53:45.960
<v Speaker 6>We're told that there were lots of </v>
<v Speaker 6>people saying that this artillery </v>

3004
02:53:45.960 --> 02:53:46.360
<v Speaker 6>barrage was going to make this a cake </v>
<v Speaker 6>walk.</v>

3005
02:53:46.361 --> 02:53:48.010
<v Speaker 6>And you've heard that before,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3006
02:53:48.670 --> 02:53:52.150
<v Speaker 6>Don't all these battles between to sound</v>
<v Speaker 6>like isn't there a repetitiveness to the</v>

3007
02:53:52.151 --> 02:53:54.100
<v Speaker 6>story?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If there is,</v>

3008
02:53:54.430 --> 02:53:59.430
<v Speaker 6>you're getting the right feeling out of </v>
<v Speaker 6>it because that's how you know it's </v>

3009
02:53:59.430 --> 02:54:01.480
<v Speaker 6>always been played and it seems like the</v>
<v Speaker 6>people at the time felt too.</v>

3010
02:54:01.481 --> 02:54:02.830
<v Speaker 6>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not again,</v>

3011
02:54:02.950 --> 02:54:07.950
<v Speaker 6>haven't we seen this movie before?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The general seem to always just want </v>

3012
02:54:07.950 --> 02:54:08.410
<v Speaker 6>more stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Give us more artillery,</v>

3013
02:54:08.411 --> 02:54:10.180
<v Speaker 6>give us more men,</v>
<v Speaker 6>give us deeper defensive,</v>

3014
02:54:10.300 --> 02:54:11.710
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll fix this situation.</v>

3015
02:54:11.920 --> 02:54:14.830
<v Speaker 6>So here's the biggest artillery barrage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The British I've ever launched.</v>

3016
02:54:15.370 --> 02:54:17.320
<v Speaker 6>They shoot off 2 million shells in no </v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

3017
02:54:18.220 --> 02:54:20.950
<v Speaker 6>And just for comparison purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>100 years before this time,</v>

3018
02:54:20.951 --> 02:54:25.951
<v Speaker 6>at the battle of waterloo,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Napoleon is estimated to have had about </v>

3019
02:54:25.951 --> 02:54:26.440
<v Speaker 6>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>Canon balls with the French army.</v>

3020
02:54:27.010 --> 02:54:29.740
<v Speaker 6>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>2 million shells in a week or two versus</v>

3021
02:54:29.741 --> 02:54:30.810
<v Speaker 6>20,000.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

3022
02:54:31.210 --> 02:54:36.210
<v Speaker 6>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The level of artillery we're going to </v>

3023
02:54:36.210 --> 02:54:38.161
<v Speaker 6>see here and it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it lowers the commander's into this </v>

3024
02:54:38.161 --> 02:54:39.910
<v Speaker 6>sense that it's going to accomplish so </v>
<v Speaker 6>much more than it does.</v>

3025
02:54:40.930 --> 02:54:45.930
<v Speaker 6>It's the soldiers on the ground though </v>
<v Speaker 6>that produced the historical reminders </v>

3026
02:54:46.330 --> 02:54:50.650
<v Speaker 6>that most of them were too realistic and</v>
<v Speaker 6>to savvy and too cynical to buy into any</v>

3027
02:54:50.651 --> 02:54:55.651
<v Speaker 6>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Rosie thinking that generals could </v>

3028
02:54:55.651 --> 02:54:55.651
<v Speaker 6>afford to be rosy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The guys on the ground going in,</v>

3029
02:54:55.651 --> 02:55:00.060
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the first wave of this assault that the </v>

3030
02:55:00.060 --> 02:55:00.850
<v Speaker 6>Germans had been waiting for you for </v>
<v Speaker 6>months.</v>

3031
02:55:01.090 --> 02:55:06.090
<v Speaker 6>They know better and you can tell </v>
<v Speaker 6>because there are absolutely </v>

3032
02:55:06.090 --> 02:55:09.560
<v Speaker 6>heartbreaking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Last letters home that have made it into</v>

3033
02:55:09.561 --> 02:55:10.730
<v Speaker 6>the history books.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Peter Hearts,</v>

3034
02:55:10.731 --> 02:55:12.990
<v Speaker 6>wonderful book on the Great War,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3035
02:55:13.100 --> 02:55:18.100
<v Speaker 6>has one of these letters from a captain </v>
<v Speaker 6>Charles May who fights in the 22nd </v>

3036
02:55:18.100 --> 02:55:22.961
<v Speaker 6>Manchester Regiment and he's writing to </v>
<v Speaker 6>his wife right before he goes over the </v>

3037
02:55:22.961 --> 02:55:23.930
<v Speaker 6>top in this battle.</v>

3038
02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:25.340
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

3039
02:55:25.350 --> 02:55:27.470
<v Speaker 6>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>imagine,</v>

3040
02:55:27.800 --> 02:55:32.800
<v Speaker 6>imagine how it affects you to be in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>position of writing a letter like this.</v>

3041
02:55:33.351 --> 02:55:36.050
<v Speaker 6>I always think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's a permanent scar on your soul.</v>

3042
02:55:36.051 --> 02:55:39.530
<v Speaker 6>Even if you get the proverbial reprieve </v>
<v Speaker 6>from the governor,</v>

3043
02:55:39.531 --> 02:55:44.531
<v Speaker 6>right from Captain Charles may have the </v>
<v Speaker 6>22nd Manchester Regiment who's about to </v>

3044
02:55:44.901 --> 02:55:47.240
<v Speaker 6>go over the top on the first day of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>somme.</v>

3045
02:55:47.540 --> 02:55:48.860
<v Speaker 6>And writes his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>

3046
02:55:50.030 --> 02:55:52.760
<v Speaker 6>I must not allow myself to dwell on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>personal.</v>

3047
02:55:52.930 --> 02:55:55.340
<v Speaker 6>There is no room for it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here also,</v>

3048
02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:58.820
<v Speaker 6>it is demoralizing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I do not want to die.</v>

3049
02:55:59.210 --> 02:56:02.180
<v Speaker 6>Not that I mind for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If it'd be that I am to go,</v>

3050
02:56:02.181 --> 02:56:05.120
<v Speaker 6>I'm ready,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the thought that I may never see you</v>

3051
02:56:05.330 --> 02:56:08.900
<v Speaker 6>or are darling baby again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it turns my bowels to water.</v>

3052
02:56:09.230 --> 02:56:12.050
<v Speaker 6>I cannot think of it with even the </v>
<v Speaker 6>semblance of equanimity.</v>

3053
02:56:12.440 --> 02:56:15.200
<v Speaker 6>My one constellation is the happiness </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's been ours.</v>

3054
02:56:15.530 --> 02:56:20.530
<v Speaker 6>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my conscience is clear that I've always </v>

3055
02:56:20.530 --> 02:56:22.991
<v Speaker 6>tried to make life a joy to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know at least that if I go you will </v>

3056
02:56:22.991 --> 02:56:26.480
<v Speaker 6>not want that is something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it is the thought that we may be cut</v>

3057
02:56:26.481 --> 02:56:31.481
<v Speaker 6>off from one another which is so </v>
<v Speaker 6>terrible and that our baby may grow up </v>

3058
02:56:31.481 --> 02:56:34.070
<v Speaker 6>without my knowing her and without her </v>
<v Speaker 6>knowing me.</v>

3059
02:56:34.370 --> 02:56:38.720
<v Speaker 6>It's difficult to face and I know your </v>
<v Speaker 6>life without me would be a double blank,</v>

3060
02:56:38.950 --> 02:56:43.950
<v Speaker 6>yet you must never let it become holy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So for to you will be left the greatest </v>

3061
02:56:43.950 --> 02:56:46.220
<v Speaker 6>charge and all the world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the upbringing of our baby.</v>

3062
02:56:46.490 --> 02:56:49.040
<v Speaker 6>God blessed that child.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's the hope of life to me,</v>

3063
02:56:49.250 --> 02:56:54.250
<v Speaker 6>my darling are of law.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It may be that you will only have to </v>

3064
02:56:54.250 --> 02:56:55.670
<v Speaker 6>read these lines as ones of passing </v>
<v Speaker 6>interest.</v>

3065
02:56:55.940 --> 02:57:00.940
<v Speaker 6>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they may well be my last message to you </v>

3066
02:57:00.940 --> 02:57:04.810
<v Speaker 6>if they are no through all your life </v>
<v Speaker 6>that I loved you and baby with all my </v>

3067
02:57:04.810 --> 02:57:08.480
<v Speaker 6>heart and soul and that you to sweet </v>
<v Speaker 6>things were just all the world to me.</v>

3068
02:57:08.750 --> 02:57:09.470
<v Speaker 6>I pray,</v>
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>

3069
02:57:09.471 --> 02:57:13.040
<v Speaker 6>I may do my duty for I know that </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever that may entail,</v>

3070
02:57:13.250 --> 02:57:18.250
<v Speaker 6>you would not have it otherwise and to </v>
<v Speaker 6>quote and Peter Hard with remarkable </v>

3071
02:57:19.851 --> 02:57:24.851
<v Speaker 6>sensitivity as a postscript and says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quote Charles may the loving husband to </v>

3072
02:57:25.791 --> 02:57:29.810
<v Speaker 6>Bessie Mae and father to his baby,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pauline would indeed be killed.</v>

3073
02:57:29.811 --> 02:57:32.370
<v Speaker 6>The next day he is buried in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>dancing,</v>

3074
02:57:32.380 --> 02:57:33.920
<v Speaker 6>galley,</v>
<v Speaker 6>British cemetery,</v>

3075
02:57:34.150 --> 02:57:36.080
<v Speaker 6>small scale tragedies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>litter,</v>

3076
02:57:36.081 --> 02:57:41.081
<v Speaker 6>the history of war,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sad reminders that the necessities of </v>

3077
02:57:41.081 --> 02:57:44.441
<v Speaker 6>war ruined the lives of millions and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>quote it says,</v>

3078
02:57:44.901 --> 02:57:49.901
<v Speaker 6>we said all this pain from this war or </v>
<v Speaker 6>like pebbles dropped in water and the </v>

3079
02:57:50.031 --> 02:57:53.090
<v Speaker 6>ripples outward effect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The rest of these societies,</v>

3080
02:57:53.091 --> 02:57:55.040
<v Speaker 6>when you have millions of people </v>
<v Speaker 6>impacted like this,</v>

3081
02:57:55.520 --> 02:58:00.520
<v Speaker 6>the ripple effect effects tens or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 6>even hundreds of millions of people</v>

3082
02:58:02.490 --> 02:58:07.490
<v Speaker 1>for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The song becomes one of these pebbles </v>

3083
02:58:07.490 --> 02:58:10.970
<v Speaker 1>that's like ground zero for a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>ripple effect that will affect Britain.</v>

3084
02:58:11.760 --> 02:58:12.750
<v Speaker 1>To this day.</v>

3085
02:58:14.330 --> 02:58:19.330
<v Speaker 1>I try to think about what mental state I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be in after writing a letter like </v>

3086
02:58:19.330 --> 02:58:23.630
<v Speaker 1>that and when you think about millions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people,</v>

3087
02:58:23.750 --> 02:58:28.750
<v Speaker 1>young people mostly being in situations </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're writing a letter like </v>

3088
02:58:28.750 --> 02:58:30.560
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does that change?</v>

3089
02:58:30.561 --> 02:58:35.561
<v Speaker 1>You mean there are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticeable changes in this generation of</v>

3090
02:58:37.071 --> 02:58:40.850
<v Speaker 1>people in the four years during this </v>
<v Speaker 1>first World War I've been comparing this</v>

3091
02:58:40.851 --> 02:58:43.040
<v Speaker 1>period to a historical estuary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3092
02:58:43.041 --> 02:58:48.041
<v Speaker 1>Where one generation and another </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation sort of mingled the the old </v>

3093
02:58:48.041 --> 02:58:52.211
<v Speaker 1>world and the new world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it's more of a worm hole </v>

3094
02:58:52.211 --> 02:58:54.980
<v Speaker 1>through time and when this 19th century </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of people,</v>

3095
02:58:55.230 --> 02:58:57.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transitions through to the 20th century,</v>

3096
02:58:58.100 --> 02:59:03.100
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to make it intact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to suffer damage on the way </v>

3097
02:59:03.100 --> 02:59:07.121
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a birthing process to the </v>

3098
02:59:07.121 --> 02:59:07.640
<v Speaker 1>modern era and that can be bloody and </v>
<v Speaker 1>painful and potentially fatal to</v>

3099
02:59:10.030 --> 02:59:15.030
<v Speaker 1>the British have thought throughout this</v>
<v Speaker 1>war that they've taken large casualties </v>

3100
02:59:15.030 --> 02:59:17.530
<v Speaker 1>in the battles of 1915 places like </v>
<v Speaker 1>deliberately.</v>

3101
02:59:17.710 --> 02:59:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Those are large casualties for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British,</v>

3102
02:59:19.571 --> 02:59:24.571
<v Speaker 1>which are a traditionally naval power </v>
<v Speaker 1>and employee relatively by continental </v>

3103
02:59:24.571 --> 02:59:25.510
<v Speaker 1>standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small armies.</v>

3104
02:59:26.500 --> 02:59:31.500
<v Speaker 1>This was the first time they've had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>large enough army to suffer the kind of </v>

3105
02:59:31.500 --> 02:59:35.431
<v Speaker 1>casualties that some nations like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French or the Germans or the Russians </v>

3106
02:59:35.431 --> 02:59:39.190
<v Speaker 1>had been suffering this whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On July first 1916,</v>

3107
02:59:39.940 --> 02:59:44.940
<v Speaker 1>the shelling subsides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whistles blow and these troops in </v>

3108
02:59:44.940 --> 02:59:49.261
<v Speaker 1>the morning or told to get out of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>trenches and had across into no man's </v>

3109
02:59:49.261 --> 02:59:53.521
<v Speaker 1>land and continued to take the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>defenses and this is where they find out</v>

3110
02:59:56.140 --> 03:00:00.970
<v Speaker 1>that the assumptions made in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planning stages of this conflict haven't</v>

3111
03:00:00.971 --> 03:00:04.360
<v Speaker 1>come to pass the way the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>experts assumed they would.</v>

3112
03:00:05.560 --> 03:00:10.560
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>British forces on the very first day of </v>

3113
03:00:10.901 --> 03:00:14.350
<v Speaker 1>the battle of the somme will suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>60,000</v>

3114
03:00:14.351 --> 03:00:17.050
<v Speaker 1>casualties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,000</v>

3115
03:00:17.051 --> 03:00:22.051
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's never been a day like it in </v>

3116
03:00:22.051 --> 03:00:25.111
<v Speaker 1>British history and now all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can understand how the French felt </v>

3117
03:00:25.111 --> 03:00:28.390
<v Speaker 1>you on that August Day in 1914 when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffer 22,000</v>

3118
03:00:28.420 --> 03:00:33.420
<v Speaker 1>dead in an afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are thoroughly modern casualties </v>

3119
03:00:33.420 --> 03:00:37.951
<v Speaker 1>into people not accustomed to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are stunning and the fingers start </v>

3120
03:00:37.951 --> 03:00:40.090
<v Speaker 1>pointing immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the heck happened?</v>

3121
03:00:41.570 --> 03:00:46.570
<v Speaker 1>A generation of people who've felt this </v>
<v Speaker 1>visceral really have kept this debate </v>

3122
03:00:46.570 --> 03:00:48.800
<v Speaker 1>going and it continues between </v>
<v Speaker 1>historians even today.</v>

3123
03:00:49.790 --> 03:00:53.180
<v Speaker 1>What the hell happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's responsible for this?</v>

3124
03:00:53.930 --> 03:00:58.930
<v Speaker 1>What happened to the troops?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will they got out of the trenches only </v>

3125
03:00:58.930 --> 03:01:00.010
<v Speaker 1>to find that in most areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the that this</v>

3126
03:01:00.010 --> 03:01:04.750
<v Speaker 6>artillery would smash up the wire wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 6>true and the wire was there.</v>

3127
03:01:05.530 --> 03:01:10.530
<v Speaker 6>It was a physical impediment in no man's</v>
<v Speaker 6>land trapping troops in the open so they</v>

3128
03:01:10.931 --> 03:01:14.140
<v Speaker 6>could be raped by machine gun fire,</v>
<v Speaker 6>artillery fire too,</v>

3129
03:01:14.141 --> 03:01:19.141
<v Speaker 6>but mainly machine gunfire from those </v>
<v Speaker 6>Germans who were not as badly affected </v>

3130
03:01:19.141 --> 03:01:22.060
<v Speaker 6>by the artillery either as the planners </v>
<v Speaker 6>had assumed they would be.</v>

3131
03:01:23.860 --> 03:01:27.400
<v Speaker 6>Tens of thousands of British soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 6>are being mowed down all the time.</v>

3132
03:01:27.401 --> 03:01:31.990
<v Speaker 6>One German on the other side of this </v>
<v Speaker 6>human tragedy at the battle of the Somme</v>

3133
03:01:31.991 --> 03:01:34.510
<v Speaker 6>on the first day is quoted in Ian </v>
<v Speaker 6>passing in his book,</v>

3134
03:01:34.511 --> 03:01:37.330
<v Speaker 6>all the Kaiser's men and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>

3135
03:01:37.840 --> 03:01:41.530
<v Speaker 6>the leading wave of British troops was </v>
<v Speaker 6>now halfway across.</v>

3136
03:01:41.531 --> 03:01:45.550
<v Speaker 6>No Man's land.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Get ready was passed along our front and</v>

3137
03:01:45.551 --> 03:01:47.910
<v Speaker 6>heads appeared over each shell crater </v>
<v Speaker 6>edge,</v>

3138
03:01:47.911 --> 03:01:52.911
<v Speaker 6>just final positions were taken up for </v>
<v Speaker 6>the best view and machine guns mounted </v>

3139
03:01:52.911 --> 03:01:52.911
<v Speaker 6>firmly in place.</v>

3140
03:01:53.080 --> 03:01:56.380
<v Speaker 6>A moment later when the first British </v>
<v Speaker 6>line was within 100 yards,</v>

3141
03:01:56.560 --> 03:02:01.560
<v Speaker 6>the rattle of machine gun and rifle fire</v>
<v Speaker 6>broke out along our whole line of shell </v>

3142
03:02:01.560 --> 03:02:05.671
<v Speaker 6>holes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>followed soon after by deadly accurate </v>

3143
03:02:05.671 --> 03:02:06.760
<v Speaker 6>shellfire,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the advanced rapidly crumbled under this</v>

3144
03:02:06.761 --> 03:02:09.580
<v Speaker 6>hail of Shell and bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All along the line,</v>

3145
03:02:09.581 --> 03:02:12.220
<v Speaker 6>men could be seen throwing up their arms</v>
<v Speaker 6>and collapsing,</v>

3146
03:02:12.460 --> 03:02:15.280
<v Speaker 6>never to move again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The extended lines,</v>

3147
03:02:15.281 --> 03:02:19.180
<v Speaker 6>though badly shaken and with many gaps </v>
<v Speaker 6>now came on all the faster.</v>

3148
03:02:19.420 --> 03:02:22.390
<v Speaker 6>Instead of a leisurely walk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they covered the ground in short,</v>

3149
03:02:22.391 --> 03:02:27.391
<v Speaker 6>rushes at the double,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and within a few minutes the leading </v>

3150
03:02:27.391 --> 03:02:29.881
<v Speaker 6>troops had advanced to within a stone's </v>
<v Speaker 6>throw of our front trench again and </v>

3151
03:02:29.881 --> 03:02:34.681
<v Speaker 6>again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The extended lines of British infantry </v>

3152
03:02:34.681 --> 03:02:36.841
<v Speaker 6>broke against the German defense like </v>
<v Speaker 6>waves against a cliff only to be beaten </v>

3153
03:02:36.841 --> 03:02:41.101
<v Speaker 6>back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was an amazing spectacle of </v>

3154
03:02:41.101 --> 03:02:43.591
<v Speaker 6>unexampled,</v>
<v Speaker 6>gallantry courage and bulldog </v>

3155
03:02:43.591 --> 03:02:44.560
<v Speaker 6>determination on both sides and quote.</v>

3156
03:02:45.760 --> 03:02:48.070
<v Speaker 6>Now those are the troops who made it </v>
<v Speaker 6>through the wire.</v>

3157
03:02:48.460 --> 03:02:51.730
<v Speaker 6>There were places where gaps had been </v>
<v Speaker 6>blown in the wire.</v>

3158
03:02:51.940 --> 03:02:55.180
<v Speaker 6>The problem was as the troops would </v>
<v Speaker 6>congregate at those gaps because they're</v>

3159
03:02:55.181 --> 03:03:00.181
<v Speaker 6>the only way to the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then get stuck in giant backups as </v>

3160
03:03:00.181 --> 03:03:04.361
<v Speaker 6>as a small stream of troops made it </v>
<v Speaker 6>through the corridor and those those </v>

3161
03:03:04.361 --> 03:03:08.311
<v Speaker 6>backups in those globs of soldiers just </v>
<v Speaker 6>waiting for their chance to get through </v>

3162
03:03:08.311 --> 03:03:11.821
<v Speaker 6>the corridor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the wire would be mowed down by shell </v>

3163
03:03:11.821 --> 03:03:14.191
<v Speaker 6>fire and machine gun fire this day has </v>
<v Speaker 6>so affected the British,</v>

3164
03:03:14.411 --> 03:03:16.160
<v Speaker 6>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's their version of redundancy.</v>

3165
03:03:16.180 --> 03:03:19.660
<v Speaker 6>What ridden is to the French soul.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Psalm is to the British one,</v>

3166
03:03:19.780 --> 03:03:22.330
<v Speaker 6>and in his divided historians ever </v>
<v Speaker 6>since,</v>

3167
03:03:22.480 --> 03:03:26.260
<v Speaker 6>and you can see normally calm and sedate</v>
<v Speaker 6>rather cold.</v>

3168
03:03:26.261 --> 03:03:30.100
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes British historians lose their </v>
<v Speaker 6>head over this subject.</v>

3169
03:03:30.510 --> 03:03:31.750
<v Speaker 6>I mean John Keegan,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who,</v>

3170
03:03:31.751 --> 03:03:32.550
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've,</v>

3171
03:03:32.580 --> 03:03:34.600
<v Speaker 6>I've said it's not my favorite but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the,</v>

3172
03:03:34.660 --> 03:03:39.660
<v Speaker 6>the two world wars I think are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are his strong point and you can tell </v>

3173
03:03:39.660 --> 03:03:43.501
<v Speaker 6>he's a guy who's hung out with some of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the enlisted troops that were trapped </v>

3174
03:03:43.501 --> 03:03:48.000
<v Speaker 6>that day at the somme because their </v>
<v Speaker 6>continued anger and incredibility about </v>

3175
03:03:49.451 --> 03:03:50.980
<v Speaker 6>this whole thing has rubbed off on him.</v>

3176
03:03:51.070 --> 03:03:53.860
<v Speaker 6>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you were trapped there like a sitting</v>

3177
03:03:53.861 --> 03:03:55.360
<v Speaker 6>duck on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3178
03:03:55.500 --> 03:04:00.500
<v Speaker 6>an open plane in no man's land watching </v>
<v Speaker 6>your buddies get blown to bits and </v>

3179
03:04:00.500 --> 03:04:00.860
<v Speaker 6>you're freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You would be thinking to,</v>

3180
03:04:00.861 --> 03:04:03.410
<v Speaker 6>who the hell put me here?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who's responsible for this?</v>

3181
03:04:03.411 --> 03:04:05.240
<v Speaker 6>If I ever get out of this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>heads will roll.</v>

3182
03:04:05.710 --> 03:04:10.710
<v Speaker 6>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most of these British troops at this </v>

3183
03:04:10.710 --> 03:04:13.571
<v Speaker 6>battle or not have a class in British </v>
<v Speaker 6>society that could have made much of a </v>

3184
03:04:13.571 --> 03:04:17.260
<v Speaker 6>fuss,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they've got loyal defenders who </v>

3185
03:04:17.260 --> 03:04:17.260
<v Speaker 6>will,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when this is over,</v>

3186
03:04:17.260 --> 03:04:18.020
<v Speaker 6>Keegan's one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>

3187
03:04:18.890 --> 03:04:23.890
<v Speaker 6>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can just feel the anger when he </v>

3188
03:04:23.890 --> 03:04:23.890
<v Speaker 6>writes quote</v>

3189
03:04:24.140 --> 03:04:26.840
<v Speaker 6>in all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the British had lost about 60,000</v>

3190
03:04:27.020 --> 03:04:32.020
<v Speaker 6>of whom 21,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>have been killed most in the first hour </v>

3191
03:04:32.020 --> 03:04:35.801
<v Speaker 6>of the attack.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Perhaps the first minutes the trenches </v>

3192
03:04:35.801 --> 03:04:36.290
<v Speaker 6>wrote Robert Key.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fifty years later.</v>

3193
03:04:36.410 --> 03:04:41.410
<v Speaker 6>Now he's quoting Robert key quote where </v>
<v Speaker 6>the concentration camps of the first </v>

3194
03:04:41.410 --> 03:04:45.611
<v Speaker 6>world war now Keagan talks again and </v>
<v Speaker 6>though the analogy is what an academic </v>

3195
03:04:45.611 --> 03:04:50.381
<v Speaker 6>review or would call an historical,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there is something Treblinka like about </v>

3196
03:04:50.721 --> 03:04:55.721
<v Speaker 6>almost all accounts of the first of July</v>
<v Speaker 6>about these long dos lines of young men.</v>

3197
03:04:56.300 --> 03:05:01.300
<v Speaker 6>Shoddily uniformed heavily burdened </v>
<v Speaker 6>numbered about their next to identify </v>

3198
03:05:01.700 --> 03:05:06.700
<v Speaker 6>after they were killed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>plodding forward across a featureless </v>

3199
03:05:06.700 --> 03:05:10.031
<v Speaker 6>landscape to their own extermination.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Inside the barbed wire accounts of the </v>

3200
03:05:10.031 --> 03:05:11.000
<v Speaker 6>psalm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he writes,</v>

3201
03:05:11.270 --> 03:05:16.270
<v Speaker 6>producing readers and audiences much the</v>
<v Speaker 6>same range of emotions as do </v>

3202
03:05:16.270 --> 03:05:17.450
<v Speaker 6>descriptions of the running of </v>
<v Speaker 6>Auschwitz,</v>

3203
03:05:17.780 --> 03:05:20.390
<v Speaker 6>guilty fascination,</v>
<v Speaker 6>incredulity,</v>

3204
03:05:20.450 --> 03:05:21.770
<v Speaker 6>horror,</v>
<v Speaker 6>disgust,</v>

3205
03:05:21.890 --> 03:05:26.890
<v Speaker 6>pity and anger and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then he goes on to say that this is </v>

3206
03:05:26.890 --> 03:05:31.520
<v Speaker 6>not just from the peaceniks and </v>
<v Speaker 6>tenderhearted out there,</v>

3207
03:05:32.180 --> 03:05:37.180
<v Speaker 6>not just from the military historians </v>
<v Speaker 6>where you get it from either but he </v>

3208
03:05:37.180 --> 03:05:40.451
<v Speaker 6>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but from the professional troops to he </v>

3209
03:05:40.451 --> 03:05:40.451
<v Speaker 6>says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>

3210
03:05:40.451 --> 03:05:45.160
<v Speaker 6>anger is the response which the story of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Somme most commonly evokes among </v>

3211
03:05:45.160 --> 03:05:45.980
<v Speaker 6>professionals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>meaning soldiers.</v>

3212
03:05:46.400 --> 03:05:48.590
<v Speaker 6>Why did the commander's not do something</v>
<v Speaker 6>about it?</v>

3213
03:05:48.770 --> 03:05:53.770
<v Speaker 6>Why do they let the attack go on?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why did they not stop one battalion </v>

3214
03:05:53.770 --> 03:05:56.510
<v Speaker 6>following the wake of another to join it</v>
<v Speaker 6>in death and quote?</v>

3215
03:05:57.940 --> 03:06:00.130
<v Speaker 6>He then goes on to say that some </v>
<v Speaker 6>battalions were stopped,</v>

3216
03:06:00.370 --> 03:06:03.490
<v Speaker 6>but that's one of the things that so </v>
<v Speaker 6>many people got angry about is that once</v>

3217
03:06:03.491 --> 03:06:04.990
<v Speaker 6>you saw,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

3218
03:06:05.170 --> 03:06:09.610
<v Speaker 6>that the wire was still there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why did you let more lines of troops get</v>

3219
03:06:09.611 --> 03:06:14.611
<v Speaker 6>up out of the trenches and followed the </v>
<v Speaker 6>people who just got destroyed in front </v>

3220
03:06:14.611 --> 03:06:17.280
<v Speaker 6>of them?</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is how someone like,</v>

3221
03:06:17.281 --> 03:06:21.390
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Haig gets a reputation for a butcher.</v>

3222
03:06:23.280 --> 03:06:24.990
<v Speaker 6>Now I've gone out of my way in this </v>
<v Speaker 6>program.</v>

3223
03:06:24.991 --> 03:06:28.380
<v Speaker 6>I think you've probably noticed too in </v>
<v Speaker 6>1915,</v>

3224
03:06:28.410 --> 03:06:31.410
<v Speaker 6>cut these general slack because they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>learning,</v>

3225
03:06:31.411 --> 03:06:36.411
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is all new stuff and until you </v>

3226
03:06:36.411 --> 03:06:36.411
<v Speaker 6>experiment a little,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't know how to use it.</v>

3227
03:06:36.411 --> 03:06:40.640
<v Speaker 6>You don't know what it can do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but at what point can you start holding </v>

3228
03:06:40.651 --> 03:06:43.830
<v Speaker 6>these people accountable for not </v>
<v Speaker 6>learning?</v>

3229
03:06:45.780 --> 03:06:50.400
<v Speaker 6>There was a great line from the civilian</v>
<v Speaker 6>political leader,</v>

3230
03:06:50.401 --> 03:06:50.940
<v Speaker 6>Germany,</v>

3231
03:06:52.450 --> 03:06:56.850
<v Speaker 6>a guy named Beth [inaudible] and he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>telling Kaiser by the end of 1916,</v>

3232
03:06:56.851 --> 03:06:59.430
<v Speaker 6>he's talking about Falcon nine here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the German military leader,</v>

3233
03:06:59.880 --> 03:07:04.620
<v Speaker 6>but it could equally apply to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>military leaders in this war,</v>

3234
03:07:04.621 --> 03:07:07.310
<v Speaker 6>especially at this time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He asked the kaiser quote,</v>

3235
03:07:08.160 --> 03:07:13.160
<v Speaker 6>where does incompetency end and </v>
<v Speaker 6>criminality begin and to quote,</v>

3236
03:07:14.850 --> 03:07:19.850
<v Speaker 6>how many lives are you allowed to lose </v>
<v Speaker 6>experimenting before you learn your </v>

3237
03:07:19.850 --> 03:07:23.511
<v Speaker 6>lessons?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But there are a great many military </v>

3238
03:07:23.511 --> 03:07:23.790
<v Speaker 6>historians today who are trying once </v>
<v Speaker 6>again to say,</v>

3239
03:07:23.791 --> 03:07:25.200
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what they're doing.</v>

3240
03:07:25.500 --> 03:07:28.230
<v Speaker 6>We're still holding them to too high a </v>
<v Speaker 6>standard.</v>

3241
03:07:28.231 --> 03:07:31.770
<v Speaker 6>Too much hindsight going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's what Peter Harte writes,</v>

3242
03:07:31.800 --> 03:07:33.930
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for many people,</v>

3243
03:07:34.080 --> 03:07:38.700
<v Speaker 6>the Psalm and the equally ugly Verdun </v>
<v Speaker 6>have come to symbolize the great war.</v>

3244
03:07:38.880 --> 03:07:43.880
<v Speaker 6>Few child battles fought with other </v>
<v Speaker 6>people's lives by incompetence and </v>

3245
03:07:43.880 --> 03:07:45.390
<v Speaker 6>uncaring generals in particular for the </v>
<v Speaker 6>British.</v>

3246
03:07:45.391 --> 03:07:48.120
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the disaster of the first of July on the</v>

3247
03:07:48.121 --> 03:07:53.121
<v Speaker 6>Psalm has become the sole prism through </v>
<v Speaker 6>which the conduct of the whole of the </v>

3248
03:07:53.121 --> 03:07:53.340
<v Speaker 6>great war has been viewed.</v>

3249
03:07:53.730 --> 03:07:56.670
<v Speaker 6>There is no light and shade here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just a dark,</v>

3250
03:07:56.671 --> 03:08:00.180
<v Speaker 6>just spare the numbing horror of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>teaming casualties,</v>

3251
03:08:00.600 --> 03:08:05.340
<v Speaker 6>explanations of what went wrong and why </v>
<v Speaker 6>are thrust aside indeed in the past,</v>

3252
03:08:05.430 --> 03:08:10.430
<v Speaker 6>subdued references to a quote end quote,</v>
<v Speaker 6>learning curve for the generals have </v>

3253
03:08:10.711 --> 03:08:14.520
<v Speaker 6>been seen as an insult to the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There remains a widespread belief.</v>

3254
03:08:14.521 --> 03:08:19.521
<v Speaker 6>He writes that there must have been a </v>
<v Speaker 6>better way something else could or </v>

3255
03:08:19.521 --> 03:08:20.700
<v Speaker 6>should have been done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Someone must be blamed.</v>

3256
03:08:20.970 --> 03:08:24.090
<v Speaker 6>Much of this appropriate has fallen on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the head of Douglas Haig,</v>

3257
03:08:24.300 --> 03:08:27.300
<v Speaker 6>who has at times been reviled as a mass </v>
<v Speaker 6>murderer.</v>

3258
03:08:27.570 --> 03:08:32.570
<v Speaker 6>Yet this was the inevitable price of </v>
<v Speaker 6>engaging in continental warfare on the </v>

3259
03:08:32.570 --> 03:08:34.290
<v Speaker 6>main field of battle against the primary</v>
<v Speaker 6>enemy.</v>

3260
03:08:34.620 --> 03:08:37.620
<v Speaker 6>France was well accustomed to the pain </v>
<v Speaker 6>of continental warfare,</v>

3261
03:08:37.890 --> 03:08:41.880
<v Speaker 6>but for Britain it was a new experience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Germany had no exposed flanks,</v>

3262
03:08:42.030 --> 03:08:47.030
<v Speaker 6>just the imposing fortifications of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>western front defending their 1914 gains</v>

3263
03:08:47.371 --> 03:08:48.990
<v Speaker 6>rested from France and Belgium.</v>

3264
03:08:49.410 --> 03:08:54.410
<v Speaker 6>Unfortunately for all their tactical </v>
<v Speaker 6>improvement and technical innovations </v>

3265
03:08:54.410 --> 03:08:58.310
<v Speaker 6>that British were just simply not able </v>
<v Speaker 6>to breach those defenses or kill </v>

3266
03:08:58.310 --> 03:09:02.091
<v Speaker 6>sufficient Germans even in concert with </v>
<v Speaker 6>the French at Verdun to bring Germany to</v>

3267
03:09:02.401 --> 03:09:07.401
<v Speaker 6>its knees and to quote.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It also makes you wonder a little about </v>

3268
03:09:08.431 --> 03:09:13.431
<v Speaker 6>the quality of the human beings who are </v>
<v Speaker 6>commanding these endeavors were making </v>

3269
03:09:13.981 --> 03:09:18.981
<v Speaker 6>these plans and who are watching all </v>
<v Speaker 6>these people die and be wounded because </v>

3270
03:09:19.891 --> 03:09:21.000
<v Speaker 6>of these plans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In other words,</v>

3271
03:09:21.240 --> 03:09:23.730
<v Speaker 6>how bad does the general field the next </v>
<v Speaker 6>day?</v>

3272
03:09:24.390 --> 03:09:26.910
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not something you can easily figure</v>

3273
03:09:26.911 --> 03:09:27.870
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>

3274
03:09:27.871 --> 03:09:31.890
<v Speaker 6>John Keegan seems to be so angry at the </v>
<v Speaker 6>field marshal here.</v>

3275
03:09:32.070 --> 03:09:34.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm still for this conflict that he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

3276
03:09:35.040 --> 03:09:40.040
<v Speaker 6>he writes an answer to that question,</v>
<v Speaker 6>kind of what kind of man do you have to </v>

3277
03:09:40.040 --> 03:09:42.600
<v Speaker 6>be to suffer those kinds of casualties?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the next day think about continuing.</v>

3278
03:09:43.920 --> 03:09:44.790
<v Speaker 6>Keegan writes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>

3279
03:09:45.420 --> 03:09:45.970
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>meg,</v>

3280
03:09:46.020 --> 03:09:51.000
<v Speaker 6>whom his contemporaries found difficult </v>
<v Speaker 6>to know has become today and enigma,</v>

3281
03:09:51.330 --> 03:09:53.560
<v Speaker 6>the successful generals of the first </v>
<v Speaker 6>world war,</v>

3282
03:09:53.770 --> 03:09:58.150
<v Speaker 6>those who did not crack outright or </v>
<v Speaker 6>decline gradually into pessimism.</v>

3283
03:09:58.390 --> 03:10:03.390
<v Speaker 6>We're a hard lot as they had to be with </v>
<v Speaker 6>the casualty figures accumulating on </v>

3284
03:10:03.390 --> 03:10:07.501
<v Speaker 6>their desk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some nonetheless managed to combine </v>

3285
03:10:07.501 --> 03:10:09.980
<v Speaker 6>toughness of mind with some striking </v>
<v Speaker 6>human characteristic is y'all.</v>

3286
03:10:10.300 --> 03:10:13.840
<v Speaker 6>He says imperturbability,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hindenburg,</v>

3287
03:10:14.170 --> 03:10:15.880
<v Speaker 6>gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fall,</v>

3288
03:10:16.330 --> 03:10:19.000
<v Speaker 6>fire,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kemal certainty.</v>

3289
03:10:19.280 --> 03:10:24.280
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he says in whose public manner and </v>

3290
03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:26.200
<v Speaker 6>private diaries,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no concern for human suffering was or is</v>

3291
03:10:26.201 --> 03:10:31.201
<v Speaker 6>discernible,</v>
<v Speaker 6>compensated for his aloofness with </v>

3292
03:10:31.201 --> 03:10:33.760
<v Speaker 6>nothing whatsoever of the common touch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He seemed to move through the horrors of</v>

3293
03:10:33.761 --> 03:10:37.360
<v Speaker 6>the first world war as if guided by some</v>
<v Speaker 6>inner voice.</v>

3294
03:10:37.510 --> 03:10:42.510
<v Speaker 6>Speaking of a higher purpose and a </v>
<v Speaker 6>personal destiny that we now know he </v>

3295
03:10:42.510 --> 03:10:47.191
<v Speaker 6>says was not just appearance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Haig was a devoted both of spiritualist </v>

3296
03:10:47.191 --> 03:10:50.770
<v Speaker 6>practices and a fundamentalist religion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>As a young officer,</v>

3297
03:10:50.890 --> 03:10:55.890
<v Speaker 6>he had taken to attending seances where </v>
<v Speaker 6>the medium put him in touch with </v>

3298
03:10:55.890 --> 03:11:00.091
<v Speaker 6>Napoleon as commander in chief.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He fell under the influence of a </v>

3299
03:11:00.091 --> 03:11:03.451
<v Speaker 6>Presbyterian chaplain who's sermons </v>
<v Speaker 6>confirmed him in his belief that he was </v>

3300
03:11:03.451 --> 03:11:08.101
<v Speaker 6>in direct communication with God and had</v>
<v Speaker 6>a major part to play in a divine plan </v>

3301
03:11:08.101 --> 03:11:13.051
<v Speaker 6>for the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His own simple religion Keagan says he </v>

3302
03:11:13.051 --> 03:11:16.771
<v Speaker 6>was convinced was shared by his soldiers</v>
<v Speaker 6>who were inspired thereby to bear the </v>

3303
03:11:16.771 --> 03:11:20.350
<v Speaker 6>dangers and sufferings which were there </v>
<v Speaker 6>part of the war.</v>

3304
03:11:20.410 --> 03:11:22.900
<v Speaker 6>He was directing and quote,</v>

3305
03:11:24.050 --> 03:11:29.050
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>welcome to the controversy and the heat </v>

3306
03:11:29.400 --> 03:11:34.400
<v Speaker 6>that the battle of the Somme has </v>
<v Speaker 6>generated amongst those who write about </v>

3307
03:11:34.400 --> 03:11:35.220
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but justifiably so,</v>

3308
03:11:35.221 --> 03:11:40.221
<v Speaker 6>I think I'm truthfully,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there were military people who </v>

3309
03:11:40.491 --> 03:11:44.530
<v Speaker 6>were certainly willing to forgive </v>
<v Speaker 6>Douglas Haig for suffering.</v>

3310
03:11:44.531 --> 03:11:49.531
<v Speaker 6>60,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>casualties on the first day of the </v>

3311
03:11:49.531 --> 03:11:49.531
<v Speaker 6>battle of the somme.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If he didn't flick,</v>

3312
03:11:49.531 --> 03:11:51.130
<v Speaker 6>did something like 60,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the Germans.</v>

3313
03:11:52.100 --> 03:11:57.100
<v Speaker 6>Instead the British suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those kinds of casualty in the German </v>

3314
03:11:57.100 --> 03:11:58.340
<v Speaker 6>casualties may have been as low as </v>
<v Speaker 6>6,000.</v>

3315
03:11:59.210 --> 03:12:04.210
<v Speaker 6>12,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>is the high number of you sometimes see </v>

3316
03:12:04.210 --> 03:12:04.210
<v Speaker 6>split the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 6>say 8,000,</v>

3317
03:12:04.210 --> 03:12:05.330
<v Speaker 6>so take 60,</v>
<v Speaker 6>give eight.</v>

3318
03:12:05.331 --> 03:12:10.220
<v Speaker 6>You get your face ripped off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not exactly the position you want,</v>

3319
03:12:10.520 --> 03:12:12.410
<v Speaker 6>your brand new general,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the new blood.</v>

3320
03:12:12.411 --> 03:12:17.411
<v Speaker 6>The person is going to bring a new sense</v>
<v Speaker 6>of success to the war on the western </v>

3321
03:12:17.411 --> 03:12:17.870
<v Speaker 6>front.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All of a sudden,</v>

3322
03:12:17.871 --> 03:12:22.871
<v Speaker 6>Douglas Haig doesn't look a whole lot </v>
<v Speaker 6>better than the people who came before </v>

3323
03:12:22.871 --> 03:12:22.871
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Heck,</v>

3324
03:12:22.871 --> 03:12:24.440
<v Speaker 6>John French could have had your separate</v>
<v Speaker 6>60,000</v>

3325
03:12:24.441 --> 03:12:25.850
<v Speaker 6>casualties on the first day of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Somme,</v>

3326
03:12:25.851 --> 03:12:27.530
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The previous commander.</v>

3327
03:12:29.400 --> 03:12:34.400
<v Speaker 6>Now to put those numbers in perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I always have to do this for </v>

3328
03:12:34.400 --> 03:12:35.340
<v Speaker 6>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>60,000.</v>

3329
03:12:35.341 --> 03:12:36.610
<v Speaker 6>That's an amorphous number.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

3330
03:12:36.620 --> 03:12:41.620
<v Speaker 6>What does that compare to?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have to understand that the British </v>

3331
03:12:41.620 --> 03:12:44.421
<v Speaker 6>for 101 years by the battle of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>psalms time had been talking about a </v>

3332
03:12:44.421 --> 03:12:44.970
<v Speaker 6>horrible day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They'd suffered,</v>

3333
03:12:45.330 --> 03:12:47.190
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>finishing off Napoleon,</v>

3334
03:12:47.191 --> 03:12:48.600
<v Speaker 6>the waterloo,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right in 18,</v>

3335
03:12:48.610 --> 03:12:52.340
<v Speaker 6>15 on Napoleon killed 84 British</v>

3336
03:12:52.340 --> 03:12:57.340
<v Speaker 1>soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eighty 400 compared to 20 or 21 or </v>

3337
03:12:57.340 --> 03:12:58.160
<v Speaker 1>19,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's huge difference,</v>

3338
03:12:58.161 --> 03:13:00.380
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how about the Second World War?</v>

3339
03:13:00.381 --> 03:13:05.381
<v Speaker 1>You always think of the second world war</v>
<v Speaker 1>as being worse than the first when the </v>

3340
03:13:05.381 --> 03:13:08.750
<v Speaker 1>British and Americans landed on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beaches of Normandy on June six,</v>

3341
03:13:08.751 --> 03:13:10.760
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>44 for the famous Dj landings,</v>

3342
03:13:10.761 --> 03:13:15.761
<v Speaker 1>and then pushed inland a not enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention paid to key part of that whole</v>

3343
03:13:16.341 --> 03:13:16.790
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3344
03:13:16.791 --> 03:13:19.460
<v Speaker 1>widening at the bridge had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was hard combat.</v>

3345
03:13:19.461 --> 03:13:24.461
<v Speaker 1>It was historically hard combat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it took the British and the </v>

3346
03:13:24.461 --> 03:13:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Americans combined 20 days to reach </v>
<v Speaker 1>20,000</v>

3347
03:13:27.321 --> 03:13:31.460
<v Speaker 1>casualties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it took them 20 days combined British</v>

3348
03:13:31.461 --> 03:13:35.330
<v Speaker 1>and Americans to reach one third.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amount of casualties,</v>

3349
03:13:35.840 --> 03:13:38.750
<v Speaker 1>the British alone suffered on the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>day of the battle of the somme.</v>

3350
03:13:38.780 --> 03:13:40.730
<v Speaker 1>That's wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

3351
03:13:42.660 --> 03:13:47.660
<v Speaker 1>And it sounds like Verdun doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those numbers start to sound like what </v>

3352
03:13:47.660 --> 03:13:50.880
<v Speaker 1>the French are suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that horrible battle to bleed their army</v>

3353
03:13:50.881 --> 03:13:52.470
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3354
03:13:52.530 --> 03:13:57.530
<v Speaker 1>David Fromkin in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece to end all peace quotes Norman </v>

3355
03:13:57.530 --> 03:13:58.000
<v Speaker 1>stone about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3356
03:13:58.001 --> 03:14:02.190
<v Speaker 1>how large these battles were compared to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the people in Europe are used to.</v>

3357
03:14:02.191 --> 03:14:03.060
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

3358
03:14:04.020 --> 03:14:09.020
<v Speaker 1>it has been estimated that the total of </v>
<v Speaker 1>military and civilian casualties in all </v>

3359
03:14:10.741 --> 03:14:15.741
<v Speaker 1>of Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic and international conflicts in </v>

3360
03:14:15.741 --> 03:14:19.221
<v Speaker 1>the hundred years between 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 and 1915 was no greater than a single</v>

3361
03:14:20.701 --> 03:14:25.701
<v Speaker 1>day's combat losses in any of the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>battles of 1916 and quote,</v>

3362
03:14:28.510 --> 03:14:33.510
<v Speaker 1>that's an incredible statistic when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of all of the battles that </v>

3363
03:14:33.510 --> 03:14:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Europeans fought in Europe and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>colonies and all those things,</v>

3364
03:14:35.530 --> 03:14:40.530
<v Speaker 1>all of it put together and all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>European countries for a hundred years </v>

3365
03:14:41.110 --> 03:14:45.370
<v Speaker 1>doesn't equal one of the bad days at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Verdun or the somme.</v>

3366
03:14:47.570 --> 03:14:52.010
<v Speaker 1>The societies that could handle these </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of casualties were remarkable,</v>

3367
03:14:52.280 --> 03:14:57.280
<v Speaker 1>but they took their toll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you might imagine by the time five </v>

3368
03:14:57.280 --> 03:15:01.581
<v Speaker 1>months of the psalm is over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have another million casualties </v>

3369
03:15:01.581 --> 03:15:06.501
<v Speaker 1>basically in five months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So freedom gives you roughly about a </v>

3370
03:15:06.501 --> 03:15:10.611
<v Speaker 1>million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Psalm gives you roughly about a </v>

3371
03:15:10.611 --> 03:15:11.430
<v Speaker 1>million all at the same time.</v>

3372
03:15:12.940 --> 03:15:16.390
<v Speaker 1>The burn rate on the western front is </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrifying in 1916.</v>

3373
03:15:16.870 --> 03:15:21.870
<v Speaker 1>And remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these battles are like a lot of </v>

3374
03:15:21.870 --> 03:15:25.260
<v Speaker 1>littler battles sort of lumped together </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the somme.</v>

3375
03:15:25.261 --> 03:15:30.261
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans will counter attack in that </v>

3376
03:15:30.261 --> 03:15:33.141
<v Speaker 1>five month period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 300 times a ton of those </v>

3377
03:15:33.141 --> 03:15:34.440
<v Speaker 1>counterattacks in ancient times would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been a battle all by itself,</v>

3378
03:15:34.441 --> 03:15:39.441
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason why it's so hard to </v>

3379
03:15:39.441 --> 03:15:41.961
<v Speaker 1>follow the nature of these battles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill has an overall description </v>

3380
03:15:43.200 --> 03:15:48.200
<v Speaker 1>that is just horrifying of a conceptual </v>
<v Speaker 1>view of this that makes you understand </v>

3381
03:15:48.871 --> 03:15:50.010
<v Speaker 1>what really going on,</v>

3382
03:15:50.220 --> 03:15:55.220
<v Speaker 6>if you could view it sort of from space,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he writes about both the Somme and </v>

3383
03:15:55.220 --> 03:15:55.640
<v Speaker 6>verdun quote,</v>

3384
03:15:57.010 --> 03:16:00.550
<v Speaker 6>the anatomy of the battles of Verdun and</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Somme was the same.</v>

3385
03:16:00.880 --> 03:16:04.030
<v Speaker 6>A battlefield had been selected around </v>
<v Speaker 6>this battlefield.</v>

3386
03:16:04.031 --> 03:16:06.400
<v Speaker 6>Walls were built double,</v>
<v Speaker 6>triple,</v>

3387
03:16:06.401 --> 03:16:08.830
<v Speaker 6>quadruple,</v>
<v Speaker 6>have enormous cannon.</v>

3388
03:16:09.250 --> 03:16:14.250
<v Speaker 6>Behind these railways were constructed </v>
<v Speaker 6>to feed them and mountains are shells </v>

3389
03:16:14.250 --> 03:16:16.480
<v Speaker 6>were built up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All this was the work of months.</v>

3390
03:16:16.870 --> 03:16:19.390
<v Speaker 6>Thus,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the battlefield was completely encircled</v>

3391
03:16:19.510 --> 03:16:24.510
<v Speaker 6>by thousands of guns of all sizes and a </v>
<v Speaker 6>wide oval space prepared in their midst.</v>

3392
03:16:25.180 --> 03:16:30.180
<v Speaker 6>Through this awful arena,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all the divisions of each army battered </v>

3393
03:16:30.180 --> 03:16:34.711
<v Speaker 6>ceaselessly by the enveloping artillery </v>
<v Speaker 6>were made to pass in succession as if </v>

3394
03:16:34.841 --> 03:16:39.841
<v Speaker 6>they were in the teeth of interlocking </v>
<v Speaker 6>cog wheels grinding each other for month</v>

3395
03:16:39.851 --> 03:16:41.260
<v Speaker 6>after month,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he writes,</v>

3396
03:16:41.410 --> 03:16:46.410
<v Speaker 6>the ceaseless cannonade continued at its</v>
<v Speaker 6>utmost intensity and month after month,</v>

3397
03:16:46.731 --> 03:16:51.731
<v Speaker 6>the gallon divisions of heroic human </v>
<v Speaker 6>beings were torn to pieces in this </v>

3398
03:16:51.731 --> 03:16:53.950
<v Speaker 6>terrible rotation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then came the winter,</v>

3399
03:16:54.130 --> 03:16:59.130
<v Speaker 6>pouring down rain from the sky to clog </v>
<v Speaker 6>the feet of men and drawing veils of </v>

3400
03:16:59.130 --> 03:17:01.690
<v Speaker 6>missed before the Hawk eyes of their </v>
<v Speaker 6>artillery.</v>

3401
03:17:01.900 --> 03:17:06.900
<v Speaker 6>The arena as used to happen in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>coliseum in those miniature Roman days </v>

3402
03:17:06.900 --> 03:17:11.110
<v Speaker 6>was flooded with water.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A vast sea of in sanguine mage earned by</v>

3403
03:17:11.111 --> 03:17:16.111
<v Speaker 6>thousands of vehicles by hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 6>thousands of men and millions of shells </v>

3404
03:17:16.111 --> 03:17:18.760
<v Speaker 6>replaced the blasted dust.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Still,</v>

3405
03:17:18.970 --> 03:17:23.970
<v Speaker 6>the struggle continued still,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the remorseless wheels revolved still.</v>

3406
03:17:24.071 --> 03:17:27.400
<v Speaker 6>The auditorium of artillery roared at </v>
<v Speaker 6>last.</v>

3407
03:17:27.550 --> 03:17:31.030
<v Speaker 6>The legs of men could no longer move.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They wallowed in,</v>

3408
03:17:31.031 --> 03:17:36.031
<v Speaker 6>floundered helplessly in the slime.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They are food and ammunition lagged </v>

3409
03:17:36.031 --> 03:17:38.130
<v Speaker 6>behind them along the smash in choked </v>
<v Speaker 6>roadways.</v>

3410
03:17:39.440 --> 03:17:40.020
<v Speaker 6>And to quote,</v>

3411
03:17:41.920 --> 03:17:46.920
<v Speaker 6>I keep quoting Churchill because wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>that positively tolken ask by the way,</v>

3412
03:17:49.301 --> 03:17:54.301
<v Speaker 6>there are people who you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>say that Tolkien's experiences with the </v>

3413
03:17:54.301 --> 03:17:57.880
<v Speaker 6>first world war influenced in his way of</v>
<v Speaker 6>writing and thinking,</v>

3414
03:17:58.540 --> 03:18:03.540
<v Speaker 6>but if it did,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he would have been just one of millions </v>

3415
03:18:03.540 --> 03:18:05.050
<v Speaker 6>of other people that had their outlook </v>
<v Speaker 6>transformed by this conflict.</v>

3416
03:18:05.051 --> 03:18:06.130
<v Speaker 6>And how could you not?</v>

3417
03:18:08.050 --> 03:18:13.050
<v Speaker 6>As we said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you imagine writing that last letter </v>

3418
03:18:13.050 --> 03:18:14.650
<v Speaker 6>home where it's essentially a goodbye </v>
<v Speaker 6>letter that can change you,</v>

3419
03:18:14.651 --> 03:18:19.651
<v Speaker 6>can't it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I known a lot of people who've had </v>

3420
03:18:19.651 --> 03:18:21.511
<v Speaker 6>terminal illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 6>had months to know that death was in </v>

3421
03:18:21.511 --> 03:18:23.380
<v Speaker 6>their near future.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It often changes them.</v>

3422
03:18:23.860 --> 03:18:27.100
<v Speaker 6>It often creates this introspective </v>
<v Speaker 6>mood.</v>

3423
03:18:27.101 --> 03:18:32.101
<v Speaker 6>We're all of a sudden they're focusing </v>
<v Speaker 6>on subjects that people don't usually </v>

3424
03:18:32.101 --> 03:18:34.720
<v Speaker 6>spend hour after hour,</v>
<v Speaker 6>day after day,</v>

3425
03:18:34.721 --> 03:18:36.540
<v Speaker 6>focusing on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's right in front of them,</v>

3426
03:18:36.541 --> 03:18:38.740
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you have terminal cancer,</v>

3427
03:18:39.490 --> 03:18:43.870
<v Speaker 6>it's going to be on your mind and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinking about it changes you.</v>

3428
03:18:44.110 --> 03:18:49.110
<v Speaker 6>What if you had a terminal disease and </v>
<v Speaker 6>all of a sudden at the last minute the </v>

3429
03:18:49.110 --> 03:18:52.831
<v Speaker 6>doctors figured out a way to cure you </v>
<v Speaker 6>when you were dragged back from the </v>

3430
03:18:52.831 --> 03:18:55.651
<v Speaker 6>brink,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you'd spend a couple of months </v>

3431
03:18:55.651 --> 03:18:57.691
<v Speaker 6>thinking intensely about life and death </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the meaning of things and what you </v>

3432
03:18:57.731 --> 03:19:02.731
<v Speaker 6>would've done differently in all these </v>
<v Speaker 6>really heavy duty thoughts that most </v>

3433
03:19:02.731 --> 03:19:04.380
<v Speaker 6>people can only stand to think about in </v>
<v Speaker 6>short little bursts.</v>

3434
03:19:04.380 --> 03:19:07.360
<v Speaker 6>Usually there are exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>

3435
03:19:07.361 --> 03:19:11.380
<v Speaker 6>imagine millions of people during this </v>
<v Speaker 6>19,</v>

3436
03:19:11.381 --> 03:19:12.280
<v Speaker 6>14,</v>
<v Speaker 6>19,</v>

3437
03:19:12.281 --> 03:19:17.281
<v Speaker 6>18 period who would have found </v>
<v Speaker 6>themselves in a similar sort of a </v>

3438
03:19:17.281 --> 03:19:21.361
<v Speaker 6>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Pretty much sure they were going to die </v>

3439
03:19:21.361 --> 03:19:24.961
<v Speaker 6>in the near future.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll be horribly disfigured thinking </v>

3440
03:19:24.961 --> 03:19:27.301
<v Speaker 6>about the heaviest of subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 6>writing letters home to loved ones </v>

3441
03:19:27.301 --> 03:19:27.301
<v Speaker 6>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3442
03:19:27.301 --> 03:19:28.930
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to miss not knowing my baby </v>
<v Speaker 6>daughter,</v>

3443
03:19:28.931 --> 03:19:33.931
<v Speaker 6>and then some of them getting a reprieve</v>
<v Speaker 6>and getting a chance to live this life.</v>

3444
03:19:34.871 --> 03:19:39.640
<v Speaker 6>They were all but writing off during the</v>
<v Speaker 6>worst of these war experiences.</v>

3445
03:19:40.480 --> 03:19:45.480
<v Speaker 6>That is a searing personal experience </v>
<v Speaker 6>that millions of individual persons went</v>

3446
03:19:47.231 --> 03:19:52.231
<v Speaker 6>through.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How does that not change the society </v>

3447
03:19:52.231 --> 03:19:55.261
<v Speaker 6>when they go home and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the things about battles,</v>

3448
03:19:55.391 --> 03:19:58.090
<v Speaker 6>especially these first world war battles</v>
<v Speaker 6>is they're so dark,</v>

3449
03:19:58.091 --> 03:20:02.230
<v Speaker 6>aren't they and theirs so industrial and</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're so unbelievably horrifying.</v>

3450
03:20:02.230 --> 03:20:07.230
<v Speaker 6>The charnal houses,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Zombie graveyard feel of the </v>

3451
03:20:07.230 --> 03:20:10.441
<v Speaker 6>battlefields and the first world war </v>
<v Speaker 6>make that particularly in a mind </v>

3452
03:20:10.441 --> 03:20:13.480
<v Speaker 6>bending.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'll see a lot of art around the first</v>

3453
03:20:13.481 --> 03:20:18.481
<v Speaker 6>world war that shows corpses decaying </v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's not so you feel sympathy with </v>

3454
03:20:18.671 --> 03:20:23.671
<v Speaker 6>the dead figure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so that you understand what it was </v>

3455
03:20:23.671 --> 03:20:26.791
<v Speaker 6>like for those people living amongst all</v>
<v Speaker 6>those decaying corpse is to deal with </v>

3456
03:20:26.791 --> 03:20:31.231
<v Speaker 6>that reality.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Mind bending battles mind bending </v>

3457
03:20:31.231 --> 03:20:31.231
<v Speaker 6>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3458
03:20:31.231 --> 03:20:35.130
<v Speaker 6>You add all the incredible artillery,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is disorienting as as all get out </v>

3459
03:20:35.321 --> 03:20:40.321
<v Speaker 6>and then throw in bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pieces of bodies everywhere when you're </v>

3460
03:20:40.321 --> 03:20:40.321
<v Speaker 6>living,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as we've said,</v>

3461
03:20:40.321 --> 03:20:41.680
<v Speaker 6>it's a unique experience.</v>

3462
03:20:43.360 --> 03:20:48.360
<v Speaker 6>It's a form of hell and yet to someone </v>
<v Speaker 6>like yours truly that creates the </v>

3463
03:20:50.380 --> 03:20:55.380
<v Speaker 6>circumstances where human brotherly love</v>
<v Speaker 6>appears so like a light in the darkness.</v>

3464
03:21:01.270 --> 03:21:05.890
<v Speaker 6>Part of why battles are interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 6>study is because as you probably figured</v>

3465
03:21:05.891 --> 03:21:10.891
<v Speaker 6>out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can see the worst of human behavior </v>

3466
03:21:10.891 --> 03:21:12.961
<v Speaker 6>and man's inhumanity to man in them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you can also see these pieces of </v>

3467
03:21:13.721 --> 03:21:18.721
<v Speaker 6>humanity slip through and when they do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they are all the more bright and </v>

3468
03:21:19.001 --> 03:21:22.000
<v Speaker 6>noticeable because they're happening in </v>
<v Speaker 6>hell as opposed to,</v>

3469
03:21:22.020 --> 03:21:27.020
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something that happens in your </v>

3470
03:21:27.020 --> 03:21:27.020
<v Speaker 6>neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right little piece of humanity,</v>

3471
03:21:27.020 --> 03:21:30.271
<v Speaker 6>not that surprising in your neighborhood</v>
<v Speaker 6>probably makes your day a little </v>

3472
03:21:30.271 --> 03:21:33.301
<v Speaker 6>brighter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A piece of humanity in the hell have </v>

3473
03:21:33.301 --> 03:21:35.821
<v Speaker 6>these battlefields has a rejuvenating </v>
<v Speaker 6>effect for ones feel about man.</v>

3474
03:21:37.870 --> 03:21:42.870
<v Speaker 6>Take for example the sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These no man's land in the fighting </v>

3475
03:21:46.191 --> 03:21:49.700
<v Speaker 6>lines of the two sides on the western </v>
<v Speaker 6>front created something that the battles</v>

3476
03:21:49.701 --> 03:21:51.410
<v Speaker 6>have had forever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean in the Second World War,</v>

3477
03:21:51.411 --> 03:21:53.390
<v Speaker 6>you'd have these crossroads,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for example,</v>

3478
03:21:53.391 --> 03:21:55.580
<v Speaker 6>where some machine gunner had set up and</v>
<v Speaker 6>now all of a sudden,</v>

3479
03:21:55.740 --> 03:21:57.730
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was death to cross this crossroads,</v>

3480
03:21:57.740 --> 03:22:02.540
<v Speaker 6>but the western front is hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 6>miles of trench lines.</v>

3481
03:22:02.870 --> 03:22:07.870
<v Speaker 6>All of them with this dead zone in </v>
<v Speaker 6>between and on the really big fronts </v>

3482
03:22:07.870 --> 03:22:11.801
<v Speaker 6>where a lot was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was tons of drama in those dead </v>

3483
03:22:11.801 --> 03:22:14.330
<v Speaker 6>zones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Things would happen that would challenge</v>

3484
03:22:14.331 --> 03:22:18.110
<v Speaker 6>men's morality and what you're willing </v>
<v Speaker 6>to do.</v>

3485
03:22:18.111 --> 03:22:21.140
<v Speaker 6>A perfect example is in the battle of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the somme.</v>

3486
03:22:22.310 --> 03:22:25.310
<v Speaker 6>When the 60,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>casualties and a lot of other casualties</v>

3487
03:22:25.311 --> 03:22:26.990
<v Speaker 6>over the course of that battle are </v>
<v Speaker 6>happening,</v>

3488
03:22:27.350 --> 03:22:32.350
<v Speaker 6>the Germans are often taking pity on </v>
<v Speaker 6>their fellow human beings and the </v>

3489
03:22:32.350 --> 03:22:37.181
<v Speaker 6>British right about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean when these British attacks would </v>

3490
03:22:37.181 --> 03:22:42.141
<v Speaker 6>break against the German defenses and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the wounded would start back toward the </v>

3491
03:22:42.141 --> 03:22:45.891
<v Speaker 6>safety of their own trenches,</v>
<v Speaker 6>grabbing even worse wounded people with </v>

3492
03:22:45.891 --> 03:22:48.300
<v Speaker 6>them and trying to under machine guns </v>
<v Speaker 6>and artillery fire get back to their own</v>

3493
03:22:48.540 --> 03:22:53.540
<v Speaker 6>trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of times these Germans would just </v>

3494
03:22:53.540 --> 03:22:55.521
<v Speaker 6>stop shooting on the first terrible day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There were oftentimes where the machine </v>

3495
03:22:55.521 --> 03:22:56.970
<v Speaker 6>gunners in the officers would just say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stop,</v>

3496
03:22:57.090 --> 03:22:59.650
<v Speaker 6>let them get back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the human thing to do.</v>

3497
03:22:59.680 --> 03:22:59.980
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3498
03:23:00.760 --> 03:23:02.800
<v Speaker 6>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if they had just machine gun them,</v>

3499
03:23:03.160 --> 03:23:08.160
<v Speaker 6>that window surprised anybody either,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what do you do now about those </v>

3500
03:23:08.681 --> 03:23:13.681
<v Speaker 6>people who are stuck out there in no </v>
<v Speaker 6>man's land after the attack is over?</v>

3501
03:23:14.070 --> 03:23:16.960
<v Speaker 6>There are all sorts of stories about </v>
<v Speaker 6>people who will simply,</v>

3502
03:23:17.020 --> 03:23:19.660
<v Speaker 6>if they can drag themselves to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>nearest shell hole,</v>

3503
03:23:19.810 --> 03:23:23.080
<v Speaker 6>wrap themselves up in the tarp.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They keep to keep the rain out,</v>

3504
03:23:23.290 --> 03:23:28.290
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>open up a Bible and just die in those </v>

3505
03:23:28.290 --> 03:23:28.290
<v Speaker 6>shell holes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but when they don't,</v>

3506
03:23:28.420 --> 03:23:31.240
<v Speaker 6>they can often have a terrible effect on</v>
<v Speaker 6>the men in the trenches,</v>

3507
03:23:31.241 --> 03:23:36.241
<v Speaker 6>on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Apaches in the American south west </v>

3508
03:23:36.241 --> 03:23:40.171
<v Speaker 6>used to be able to make such good use of</v>
<v Speaker 6>hostages and if you threatened to </v>

3509
03:23:40.171 --> 03:23:42.400
<v Speaker 6>torture a hostage or you did torture a </v>
<v Speaker 6>hostage,</v>

3510
03:23:42.401 --> 03:23:45.850
<v Speaker 6>you could get all kinds of concessions </v>
<v Speaker 6>from the other side.</v>

3511
03:23:46.330 --> 03:23:51.330
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are hostages that fate is holding </v>

3512
03:23:51.330 --> 03:23:51.370
<v Speaker 6>in the middle of those no man's land </v>
<v Speaker 6>areas.</v>

3513
03:23:51.700 --> 03:23:56.700
<v Speaker 6>And what do you do when one of them </v>
<v Speaker 6>starts asking for help and they're </v>

3514
03:23:56.700 --> 03:23:59.950
<v Speaker 6>basically calling to you and your body's</v>
<v Speaker 6>from no man's land.</v>

3515
03:24:01.540 --> 03:24:06.540
<v Speaker 6>If you want to see their heroism and the</v>
<v Speaker 6>sacrifice that human beings can show in </v>

3516
03:24:06.941 --> 03:24:11.941
<v Speaker 6>in these hellish situations,</v>
<v Speaker 6>read the accounts over and over about </v>

3517
03:24:11.941 --> 03:24:15.781
<v Speaker 6>how men dealt with screams for help from</v>
<v Speaker 6>no man's land.</v>

3518
03:24:17.800 --> 03:24:22.800
<v Speaker 6>A perfect example of the kind of moral </v>
<v Speaker 6>dilemmas and self sacrifice that these </v>

3519
03:24:22.800 --> 03:24:27.040
<v Speaker 6>situations,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know create is the story that Robert</v>

3520
03:24:27.040 --> 03:24:32.040
<v Speaker 6>Graves tells in goodbye all that when he</v>
<v Speaker 6>was serving at the Somme on the western </v>

3521
03:24:32.040 --> 03:24:35.731
<v Speaker 6>front and a soldier named Samson gets </v>
<v Speaker 6>hit in the wave before graves is wave </v>

3522
03:24:36.611 --> 03:24:38.860
<v Speaker 6>goes over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So graves is just getting ready for this</v>

3523
03:24:38.861 --> 03:24:43.861
<v Speaker 6>intense experience himself of going over</v>
<v Speaker 6>the top of the trench with other human </v>

3524
03:24:43.861 --> 03:24:44.790
<v Speaker 6>beings right into the teeth of machine </v>
<v Speaker 6>gunfire.</v>

3525
03:24:44.970 --> 03:24:48.840
<v Speaker 6>And all of a sudden you hear the sound </v>
<v Speaker 6>of somebody from the last attack,</v>

3526
03:24:49.260 --> 03:24:54.260
<v Speaker 6>from no man's land.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know where it's death to stand up </v>

3527
03:24:54.260 --> 03:24:56.820
<v Speaker 6>and move around asking for help or </v>
<v Speaker 6>screaming out.</v>

3528
03:24:56.821 --> 03:24:58.470
<v Speaker 6>And here's what graves rights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember,</v>

3529
03:24:58.471 --> 03:25:00.720
<v Speaker 6>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's in the state himself and thinking,</v>

3530
03:25:00.721 --> 03:25:05.721
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've got to walk into machine gunfire </v>

3531
03:25:05.721 --> 03:25:05.970
<v Speaker 6>and I've just seen all these other </v>
<v Speaker 6>people die in front of me.</v>

3532
03:25:05.970 --> 03:25:08.190
<v Speaker 6>Quote,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my mouth was dry,</v>

3533
03:25:08.430 --> 03:25:11.580
<v Speaker 6>my eyes out of focus and my legs quaking</v>
<v Speaker 6>under me.</v>

3534
03:25:11.880 --> 03:25:15.210
<v Speaker 6>I found a water bottle full of Ramen,</v>
<v Speaker 6>drank about half a pint.</v>

3535
03:25:15.450 --> 03:25:17.820
<v Speaker 6>It quieted me in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My head remained clear.</v>

3536
03:25:18.210 --> 03:25:21.960
<v Speaker 6>Samson lay groaning about 20 yards </v>
<v Speaker 6>beyond the front trench.</v>

3537
03:25:22.200 --> 03:25:24.180
<v Speaker 6>Several attempts were made to rescue </v>
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>

3538
03:25:24.181 --> 03:25:29.181
<v Speaker 6>He'd been very badly hit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Three men got killed in those attempts </v>

3539
03:25:29.181 --> 03:25:31.230
<v Speaker 6>to officers in two men wounded in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>end,</v>

3540
03:25:31.350 --> 03:25:33.960
<v Speaker 6>his own orderly managed to crawl out to </v>
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>

3541
03:25:34.170 --> 03:25:38.640
<v Speaker 6>Samson waved him back saying he was </v>
<v Speaker 6>riddled through and not worth rescuing.</v>

3542
03:25:38.850 --> 03:25:43.200
<v Speaker 6>He sent his apologies to the company for</v>
<v Speaker 6>making such noise and the quote.</v>

3543
03:25:44.040 --> 03:25:46.680
<v Speaker 6>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this guy is out there screaming and it's</v>

3544
03:25:46.681 --> 03:25:51.681
<v Speaker 6>so driving his own comrades crazy that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they keep running out there to do </v>

3545
03:25:51.681 --> 03:25:54.780
<v Speaker 6>something and everyone who runs out </v>
<v Speaker 6>there to do something gets killed.</v>

3546
03:25:55.350 --> 03:25:57.540
<v Speaker 6>At what point,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're the wounded person,</v>

3547
03:25:57.960 --> 03:26:02.960
<v Speaker 6>do you try to just stop making noise so </v>
<v Speaker 6>that they don't keep trying to help you </v>

3548
03:26:02.960 --> 03:26:06.981
<v Speaker 6>out of sympathy when you probably are </v>
<v Speaker 6>dying anyway and now you've lost three </v>

3549
03:26:06.981 --> 03:26:10.800
<v Speaker 6>people or more simply trying to prevent </v>
<v Speaker 6>the inevitable you're going through.</v>

3550
03:26:11.070 --> 03:26:16.070
<v Speaker 6>So at night when we're told the no man's</v>
<v Speaker 6>land area comes to life and you know,</v>

3551
03:26:18.450 --> 03:26:20.430
<v Speaker 6>we're appears deserted during the </v>
<v Speaker 6>daytime.</v>

3552
03:26:20.431 --> 03:26:22.260
<v Speaker 6>At night,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the trench patrols go out.</v>

3553
03:26:22.620 --> 03:26:25.530
<v Speaker 6>The people who you know fix the barbed </v>
<v Speaker 6>wire,</v>

3554
03:26:25.710 --> 03:26:29.100
<v Speaker 6>the intelligence folks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the people conducting trench raids.</v>

3555
03:26:29.101 --> 03:26:31.620
<v Speaker 6>I mean supposedly there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>activity in the dark.</v>

3556
03:26:31.621 --> 03:26:36.621
<v Speaker 6>Even though star shells light up the sky</v>
<v Speaker 6>all the time at dark graves in his unit </v>

3557
03:26:39.240 --> 03:26:42.900
<v Speaker 6>moves out to go cleared any wounded in </v>
<v Speaker 6>front of their trenches.</v>

3558
03:26:42.901 --> 03:26:44.280
<v Speaker 6>And he writes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quote at dusk.</v>

3559
03:26:44.281 --> 03:26:47.880
<v Speaker 6>We all went out to get the wounded </v>
<v Speaker 6>leaving only centuries in the line.</v>

3560
03:26:48.120 --> 03:26:52.680
<v Speaker 6>The first dead body I came upon was </v>
<v Speaker 6>Samson's hit in 17 places.</v>

3561
03:26:53.010 --> 03:26:58.010
<v Speaker 6>I found that he had forced his knuckles </v>
<v Speaker 6>into his mouth to stop himself crying </v>

3562
03:26:58.010 --> 03:26:59.040
<v Speaker 6>out and attracting any more men to their</v>
<v Speaker 6>death.</v>

3563
03:26:59.610 --> 03:27:04.610
<v Speaker 6>And to quote,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so this poor man out there hit 17 times </v>

3564
03:27:05.400 --> 03:27:08.310
<v Speaker 6>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 6>horribly unable to keep from crying out,</v>

3565
03:27:08.550 --> 03:27:13.550
<v Speaker 6>can't stand the thought of attracting </v>
<v Speaker 6>anymore and men to rescue him and dies </v>

3566
03:27:13.741 --> 03:27:16.920
<v Speaker 6>with his hand in his mouth to keep from </v>
<v Speaker 6>crying.</v>

3567
03:27:16.920 --> 03:27:17.760
<v Speaker 6>I mean it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

3568
03:27:19.100 --> 03:27:20.900
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's the beauty that,</v>

3569
03:27:20.940 --> 03:27:25.940
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that finds its way into the horrific </v>

3570
03:27:25.940 --> 03:27:26.580
<v Speaker 6>ness of this war.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're that person's parent,</v>

3571
03:27:26.581 --> 03:27:28.860
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing to consoles you that </v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't make you feel any better,</v>

3572
03:27:28.861 --> 03:27:31.380
<v Speaker 6>but as a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you look at that and say,</v>

3573
03:27:31.650 --> 03:27:34.050
<v Speaker 6>there's something about that man's </v>
<v Speaker 6>sacrifice that's beautiful.</v>

3574
03:27:35.130 --> 03:27:39.750
<v Speaker 6>Now graves tells another story,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which not only shows the heroism and the</v>

3575
03:27:39.751 --> 03:27:44.751
<v Speaker 6>beauty of one of his compatriots,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the same sort of an attitude on the </v>

3576
03:27:44.751 --> 03:27:47.110
<v Speaker 6>part of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The British thought were the bad guys.</v>

3577
03:27:47.380 --> 03:27:48.340
<v Speaker 6>The Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as we said,</v>

3578
03:27:48.430 --> 03:27:50.440
<v Speaker 6>the Germans had been holding their fire </v>
<v Speaker 6>quite a bit.</v>

3579
03:27:51.020 --> 03:27:53.680
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>during this battle and you see it on the</v>

3580
03:27:53.681 --> 03:27:55.120
<v Speaker 6>French side.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the British side too.</v>

3581
03:27:55.121 --> 03:28:00.121
<v Speaker 6>I mean this is not abnormal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a little bit like that Christmas </v>

3582
03:28:00.121 --> 03:28:04.381
<v Speaker 6>truce we talked about in the 1914,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a era of this war were spontaneously </v>

3583
03:28:04.900 --> 03:28:09.900
<v Speaker 6>troops got up and sort of gave each </v>
<v Speaker 6>other a little Christmas love in between</v>

3584
03:28:10.031 --> 03:28:10.930
<v Speaker 6>the shellings,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

3585
03:28:11.350 --> 03:28:14.200
<v Speaker 6>You see this humanity appear even in </v>
<v Speaker 6>this hell.</v>

3586
03:28:14.470 --> 03:28:19.470
<v Speaker 6>Graves talks about another soldier in no</v>
<v Speaker 6>man's land who wakes up in a seemingly </v>

3587
03:28:22.101 --> 03:28:24.530
<v Speaker 6>dead and then all of a sudden is crying </v>
<v Speaker 6>for help,</v>

3588
03:28:25.190 --> 03:28:30.190
<v Speaker 6>and when this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 6>every man in his trench feels like he's </v>

3589
03:28:30.190 --> 03:28:34.271
<v Speaker 6>going through some sort of a moral </v>
<v Speaker 6>tasked and one man passes it with flying</v>

3590
03:28:34.551 --> 03:28:36.710
<v Speaker 6>colors.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Graves writes quote,</v>

3591
03:28:38.690 --> 03:28:42.770
<v Speaker 6>on the morning of the 27th,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a cry arose from no man's land.</v>

3592
03:28:43.040 --> 03:28:46.400
<v Speaker 6>A wounded soldier of the middle sex unit</v>
<v Speaker 6>had recovered consciousness.</v>

3593
03:28:46.401 --> 03:28:49.760
<v Speaker 6>After two days,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he lay close to the German wire.</v>

3594
03:28:50.030 --> 03:28:52.070
<v Speaker 6>Our men heard it and looked at each </v>
<v Speaker 6>other.</v>

3595
03:28:52.460 --> 03:28:55.400
<v Speaker 6>We had a tender hearted lance corporal </v>
<v Speaker 6>named Baxter.</v>

3596
03:28:55.700 --> 03:28:59.240
<v Speaker 6>He was the man to boil up a special </v>
<v Speaker 6>dixie for the centuries of his section.</v>

3597
03:28:59.241 --> 03:29:01.700
<v Speaker 6>When they came off duty,</v>
<v Speaker 6>made them a little soup or tea.</v>

3598
03:29:02.150 --> 03:29:04.730
<v Speaker 6>As soon as he heard the wounded </v>
<v Speaker 6>Middlesex man,</v>

3599
03:29:04.880 --> 03:29:08.570
<v Speaker 6>he ran along the trench calling for a </v>
<v Speaker 6>volunteer to help fetch him in.</v>

3600
03:29:08.870 --> 03:29:10.700
<v Speaker 6>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no one would go.</v>

3601
03:29:10.940 --> 03:29:13.280
<v Speaker 6>It was death to put one's head over the </v>
<v Speaker 6>parapet.</v>

3602
03:29:13.520 --> 03:29:18.520
<v Speaker 6>When he came running to ask me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I excused myself as being the only </v>

3603
03:29:18.520 --> 03:29:19.970
<v Speaker 6>officer in the company.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would come out with him at dusk.</v>

3604
03:29:20.030 --> 03:29:21.560
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not now.</v>

3605
03:29:21.770 --> 03:29:22.880
<v Speaker 6>So he went alone.</v>

3606
03:29:23.330 --> 03:29:27.530
<v Speaker 6>He jumped quickly over the parapet and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then strolled across no man's land,</v>

3607
03:29:27.531 --> 03:29:31.220
<v Speaker 6>waving a handkerchief.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Germans fire to frighten him,</v>

3608
03:29:31.221 --> 03:29:33.290
<v Speaker 6>but since he persisted,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they let him come.</v>

3609
03:29:33.291 --> 03:29:36.470
<v Speaker 6>Close.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Baxter continued toward them and when he</v>

3610
03:29:36.471 --> 03:29:41.471
<v Speaker 6>got to the Middlesex man stopped and </v>
<v Speaker 6>pointed to show the Germans what he was </v>

3611
03:29:41.471 --> 03:29:42.980
<v Speaker 6>at,</v>
<v Speaker 6>meaning what he was up to.</v>

3612
03:29:43.550 --> 03:29:48.550
<v Speaker 6>Then he dressed the man's wounds,</v>
<v Speaker 6>gave him a drink of rom and some </v>

3613
03:29:48.550 --> 03:29:50.840
<v Speaker 6>biscuits that he had with him and </v>
<v Speaker 6>promised to be back again at nightfall.</v>

3614
03:29:51.050 --> 03:29:54.740
<v Speaker 6>He did come back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Graves writes with a stretcher party and</v>

3615
03:29:54.741 --> 03:29:59.741
<v Speaker 6>the man eventually recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I recommended Baxter for the Victoria </v>

3616
03:29:59.741 --> 03:30:01.010
<v Speaker 6>Cross being the only officer who had </v>
<v Speaker 6>witnessed the action,</v>

3617
03:30:01.190 --> 03:30:06.190
<v Speaker 6>but the authorities thought it worth no </v>
<v Speaker 6>more than a distinguished conduct medal </v>

3618
03:30:06.190 --> 03:30:06.190
<v Speaker 6>and the quote</v>

3619
03:30:07.250 --> 03:30:12.250
<v Speaker 6>sounds worthy of a Victoria cross to me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's one of those incidents where </v>

3620
03:30:12.250 --> 03:30:15.230
<v Speaker 6>you see the opposite of man's </v>
<v Speaker 6>inhumanity.</v>

3621
03:30:15.231 --> 03:30:19.580
<v Speaker 6>Demand in an environment designed to </v>
<v Speaker 6>foster the former.</v>

3622
03:30:20.570 --> 03:30:22.310
<v Speaker 6>It stands out all the more,</v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't it?</v>

3623
03:30:23.380 --> 03:30:26.930
<v Speaker 6>That baxter could have easily been mowed</v>
<v Speaker 6>down and if you don't think it happens.</v>

3624
03:30:26.931 --> 03:30:31.931
<v Speaker 6>Remember three people were mowed down </v>
<v Speaker 6>trying to say that wounded Samson </v>

3625
03:30:31.931 --> 03:30:35.801
<v Speaker 6>character in the first graves story,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't help but wonder how my </v>

3626
03:30:36.861 --> 03:30:40.100
<v Speaker 6>generation would handle what these </v>
<v Speaker 6>people forced to do.</v>

3627
03:30:40.520 --> 03:30:42.590
<v Speaker 6>You think of the first day on the battle</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the somme.</v>

3628
03:30:42.860 --> 03:30:47.860
<v Speaker 6>Think of yourself in the second wave or </v>
<v Speaker 6>the third wave and you hear all this </v>

3629
03:30:48.951 --> 03:30:53.951
<v Speaker 6>stuff from the officers about all the </v>
<v Speaker 6>artillery will destroy everybody that </v>

3630
03:30:53.951 --> 03:30:57.421
<v Speaker 6>nobody will be left alive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then the first wave in front of you </v>

3631
03:30:57.421 --> 03:31:00.401
<v Speaker 6>units that you know go over the top and </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't even get near their objective </v>

3632
03:31:00.401 --> 03:31:01.010
<v Speaker 6>before they're cut to ribbons.</v>

3633
03:31:01.040 --> 03:31:06.040
<v Speaker 6>It's an absolute catastrophe and screw </v>
<v Speaker 6>up and everybody can see it happening </v>

3634
03:31:06.440 --> 03:31:08.780
<v Speaker 6>and then they turn into the next wave.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that's not you.</v>

3635
03:31:08.781 --> 03:31:13.781
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you're in the third and tell them </v>
<v Speaker 6>to go do the same thing and they do in </v>

3636
03:31:13.781 --> 03:31:13.781
<v Speaker 6>the same thing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3637
03:31:13.781 --> 03:31:17.390
<v Speaker 6>It's suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now they turn to you and they say,</v>

3638
03:31:17.391 --> 03:31:18.740
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's your unit turn.</v>

3639
03:31:19.670 --> 03:31:24.670
<v Speaker 6>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Forget cowardice for a second because </v>

3640
03:31:24.670 --> 03:31:26.780
<v Speaker 6>there are people who simply ran away or </v>
<v Speaker 6>who's nerves failed them or whatever.</v>

3641
03:31:27.200 --> 03:31:29.000
<v Speaker 6>This is not a question of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3642
03:31:29.420 --> 03:31:34.420
<v Speaker 6>what could you do physically?</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a question of what would you do?</v>

3643
03:31:36.750 --> 03:31:41.750
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think a lot of us would think to </v>

3644
03:31:41.750 --> 03:31:44.451
<v Speaker 6>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no way I'm surviving going out </v>

3645
03:31:44.451 --> 03:31:48.651
<v Speaker 6>onto that battlefield,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if this officer wasn't here telling </v>

3646
03:31:48.651 --> 03:31:51.330
<v Speaker 6>me to do this and my buddies and I just </v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of decided all together,</v>

3647
03:31:51.331 --> 03:31:54.000
<v Speaker 6>we're not doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe something would change.</v>

3648
03:31:54.001 --> 03:31:59.001
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of the first war novels to come out </v>

3649
03:31:59.001 --> 03:32:01.491
<v Speaker 6>of the first world war actually came out</v>
<v Speaker 6>during the first world war from a </v>

3650
03:32:01.491 --> 03:32:05.170
<v Speaker 6>Frenchman named Henri barbless,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and he wrote something where he as a </v>

3651
03:32:05.191 --> 03:32:07.890
<v Speaker 6>soldier had served already.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was a disabled veteran.</v>

3652
03:32:07.891 --> 03:32:12.891
<v Speaker 6>He wrote this piece while the war was </v>
<v Speaker 6>still going on and it's surprisingly </v>

3653
03:32:12.891 --> 03:32:16.920
<v Speaker 6>antiwar for the government to have put </v>
<v Speaker 6>up with it during the conflict and he </v>

3654
03:32:16.920 --> 03:32:21.201
<v Speaker 6>implied that the soldiers on both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the common soldiers should just agree </v>

3655
03:32:21.201 --> 03:32:23.460
<v Speaker 6>with each other that they're not going </v>
<v Speaker 6>to fight anymore.</v>

3656
03:32:23.600 --> 03:32:25.440
<v Speaker 6>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If they gave a war and no one came,</v>

3657
03:32:25.441 --> 03:32:27.390
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if the soldiers on both sides say,</v>

3658
03:32:27.600 --> 03:32:28.950
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the government's can tell us to fight,</v>

3659
03:32:28.951 --> 03:32:33.951
<v Speaker 6>but we're not fighting anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And Barbara said that in the book that </v>

3660
03:32:33.951 --> 03:32:37.050
<v Speaker 6>the truthfully the only people who </v>
<v Speaker 6>really understood what the French </v>

3661
03:32:37.050 --> 03:32:40.101
<v Speaker 6>soldier and the British soldier we're </v>
<v Speaker 6>going through in these hellish </v>

3662
03:32:40.101 --> 03:32:43.131
<v Speaker 6>conditions where the German soldiers on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the other side of the no man's land </v>

3663
03:32:43.131 --> 03:32:45.660
<v Speaker 6>living under the exact same hellish </v>
<v Speaker 6>conditions.</v>

3664
03:32:47.480 --> 03:32:52.480
<v Speaker 6>When the Germans don't fire on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>British who are getting their wounded </v>

3665
03:32:52.480 --> 03:32:54.170
<v Speaker 6>and a lot of times just because there's </v>
<v Speaker 6>this unwritten deal that says,</v>

3666
03:32:54.770 --> 03:32:59.770
<v Speaker 6>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 6>leave you alone right now to get your </v>

3667
03:32:59.770 --> 03:33:02.021
<v Speaker 6>wounded people out of there in the hopes</v>
<v Speaker 6>that when it's my wounded people in no </v>

3668
03:33:02.021 --> 03:33:03.110
<v Speaker 6>man's land and I'm trying to get them </v>
<v Speaker 6>out of there,</v>

3669
03:33:03.500 --> 03:33:08.500
<v Speaker 6>you'll let me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One of the real phenomenons of this war</v>

3670
03:33:10.160 --> 03:33:15.160
<v Speaker 6>is the fact that when left alone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of soldiers on both sides decided </v>

3671
03:33:15.161 --> 03:33:20.161
<v Speaker 6>to adopt what's what's officially known </v>
<v Speaker 6>as a live and let live attitude in this </v>

3672
03:33:20.471 --> 03:33:22.120
<v Speaker 6>war and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was common everywhere,</v>

3673
03:33:22.121 --> 03:33:25.450
<v Speaker 6>but the western front more than any </v>
<v Speaker 6>other where for example,</v>

3674
03:33:26.080 --> 03:33:31.080
<v Speaker 6>soldiers would be required and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>hated this job to go out at night and </v>

3675
03:33:31.361 --> 03:33:34.420
<v Speaker 6>put more barbed wire up in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 6>no man's land.</v>

3676
03:33:34.421 --> 03:33:38.010
<v Speaker 6>So you sneak out because it's dark and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you bring wire with and wire cutters and</v>

3677
03:33:38.011 --> 03:33:39.990
<v Speaker 6>all these things and you have to go hang</v>
<v Speaker 6>new wire.</v>

3678
03:33:40.080 --> 03:33:42.270
<v Speaker 6>It's an extremely dangerous job in both </v>
<v Speaker 6>sides.</v>

3679
03:33:42.271 --> 03:33:43.200
<v Speaker 6>Hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3680
03:33:43.920 --> 03:33:45.900
<v Speaker 6>So a lot of times they just wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>shoot.</v>

3681
03:33:46.470 --> 03:33:48.320
<v Speaker 6>At the other people who were putting </v>
<v Speaker 6>wire up,</v>

3682
03:33:48.330 --> 03:33:53.330
<v Speaker 6>now the officers hated this and one of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the big scandals was after the Christmas</v>

3683
03:33:54.121 --> 03:33:59.121
<v Speaker 6>truce,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the so called Christmas truce in 1914 </v>

3684
03:33:59.121 --> 03:34:01.221
<v Speaker 6>when both sides would have fraternized.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The officers had to make all these </v>

3685
03:34:01.221 --> 03:34:02.700
<v Speaker 6>arrangements so that next Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nothing like this happened again,</v>

3686
03:34:02.701 --> 03:34:06.510
<v Speaker 6>and the men had preserved a proper </v>
<v Speaker 6>fighting spirit would be the way most of</v>

3687
03:34:06.511 --> 03:34:10.890
<v Speaker 6>these militaries would phrase it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the troops often found a lot more to</v>

3688
03:34:10.891 --> 03:34:13.020
<v Speaker 6>like about each other than their own </v>
<v Speaker 6>officers.</v>

3689
03:34:14.810 --> 03:34:19.810
<v Speaker 6>Corporal Louis Bartos in the French army</v>
<v Speaker 6>writes about this incident where a flood</v>

3690
03:34:19.881 --> 03:34:24.881
<v Speaker 6>occurs and all of a sudden the trenches </v>
<v Speaker 6>on both sides of no man's land have to </v>

3691
03:34:24.881 --> 03:34:29.771
<v Speaker 6>clear and how you have one of those </v>
<v Speaker 6>moments where you just look at your </v>

3692
03:34:29.771 --> 03:34:32.921
<v Speaker 6>enemy and he looks at you and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>realize the socks and who put us into </v>

3693
03:34:33.291 --> 03:34:36.170
<v Speaker 6>this mess and why are we doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he almost writes,</v>

3694
03:34:36.171 --> 03:34:37.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Martez is a socialist.</v>

3695
03:34:37.701 --> 03:34:39.770
<v Speaker 6>Like a lot of these troops in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>trenches are.</v>

3696
03:34:40.040 --> 03:34:43.940
<v Speaker 6>So he has a worldview that kind of sees </v>
<v Speaker 6>the upper classes,</v>

3697
03:34:43.941 --> 03:34:48.320
<v Speaker 6>the corporate groups and all that is the</v>
<v Speaker 6>problem and that the average soldiers in</v>

3698
03:34:48.321 --> 03:34:53.321
<v Speaker 6>the trenches,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're all just kind of common workers </v>

3699
03:34:53.321 --> 03:34:55.691
<v Speaker 6>being exploited by the man and he writes</v>
<v Speaker 6>about this famous a flood that he </v>

3700
03:34:56.061 --> 03:34:58.880
<v Speaker 6>experiences and what it does and how it </v>
<v Speaker 6>freaks out,</v>

3701
03:34:59.120 --> 03:34:59.860
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in his mind,</v>

3702
03:34:59.890 --> 03:35:02.900
<v Speaker 6>the upper classes in the officer corps </v>
<v Speaker 6>that all of a sudden,</v>

3703
03:35:03.140 --> 03:35:08.140
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>both sides in this combat are starting </v>

3704
03:35:08.140 --> 03:35:09.170
<v Speaker 6>to have some sympathy for each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he writes quote.</v>

3705
03:35:11.080 --> 03:35:13.810
<v Speaker 6>But one night when the rain came down in</v>
<v Speaker 6>torrance,</v>

3706
03:35:14.020 --> 03:35:19.020
<v Speaker 6>the tide invaded our dugout and cascaded</v>
<v Speaker 6>down both sets of steps at the height of</v>

3707
03:35:19.691 --> 03:35:24.691
<v Speaker 6>the storm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some of the men had to devote all their </v>

3708
03:35:24.691 --> 03:35:27.271
<v Speaker 6>efforts to building a dam,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which the water then broke through in </v>

3709
03:35:27.271 --> 03:35:30.691
<v Speaker 6>three or four places.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We spent the rest of the night battling </v>

3710
03:35:30.691 --> 03:35:30.820
<v Speaker 6>the floodwaters.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The next day,</v>

3711
03:35:30.970 --> 03:35:34.030
<v Speaker 6>December 10th,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at many places along the front line,</v>

3712
03:35:34.031 --> 03:35:35.860
<v Speaker 6>the soldiers had to come out of their </v>
<v Speaker 6>trenches.</v>

3713
03:35:35.861 --> 03:35:39.070
<v Speaker 6>So as not to drown.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Germans had to do the same.</v>

3714
03:35:39.340 --> 03:35:44.340
<v Speaker 6>We therefore had the singular spectacle </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the two enemy armies facing each </v>

3715
03:35:44.340 --> 03:35:48.580
<v Speaker 6>other without firing a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Our common sufferings brought our hearts</v>

3716
03:35:48.581 --> 03:35:50.820
<v Speaker 6>together,</v>
<v Speaker 6>melted the hatreds,</v>

3717
03:35:51.490 --> 03:35:54.490
<v Speaker 6>nurtured sympathy between strangers and </v>
<v Speaker 6>adversaries.</v>

3718
03:35:54.730 --> 03:35:57.340
<v Speaker 6>Those who deny it are ignoring human </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychology,</v>

3719
03:35:57.610 --> 03:35:58.240
<v Speaker 6>French,</v>
<v Speaker 6>German,</v>

3720
03:35:58.241 --> 03:35:59.290
<v Speaker 6>and Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He writes,</v>

3721
03:35:59.500 --> 03:36:02.380
<v Speaker 6>looked at each other and saw that they </v>
<v Speaker 6>were all men.</v>

3722
03:36:02.560 --> 03:36:04.990
<v Speaker 6>No different from one another.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They smiled,</v>

3723
03:36:05.080 --> 03:36:08.560
<v Speaker 6>exchanged comments,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hands reached out and grasped.</v>

3724
03:36:08.710 --> 03:36:13.710
<v Speaker 6>We shared tobacco,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a canteen of coffee or wine if only we </v>

3725
03:36:13.710 --> 03:36:18.181
<v Speaker 6>spoke the same language.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One day he writes a huge devil of a </v>

3726
03:36:18.181 --> 03:36:20.350
<v Speaker 6>German,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stood up on a mound and gave a speech,</v>

3727
03:36:20.530 --> 03:36:22.960
<v Speaker 6>which only the Germans could understand </v>
<v Speaker 6>word for word,</v>

3728
03:36:23.170 --> 03:36:27.400
<v Speaker 6>but everyone knew what it meant because </v>
<v Speaker 6>he smashed his rifle on a tree stump,</v>

3729
03:36:27.640 --> 03:36:32.640
<v Speaker 6>breaking it into in a gesture of anger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Applause broke out on both sides and the</v>

3730
03:36:32.861 --> 03:36:37.861
<v Speaker 6>international was sung.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He says the national anthem of the </v>

3731
03:36:37.861 --> 03:36:39.040
<v Speaker 6>socialist cause I guess you could say </v>
<v Speaker 6>the workers,</v>

3732
03:36:39.041 --> 03:36:41.200
<v Speaker 6>cause he says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>quote,</v>

3733
03:36:41.440 --> 03:36:42.910
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if only you'd been there.</v>

3734
03:36:42.911 --> 03:36:46.780
<v Speaker 6>Mad King's bloody generals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fanatical ministers,</v>

3735
03:36:46.870 --> 03:36:51.870
<v Speaker 6>jingoistic journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Rear Echelon Patriots to contemplate </v>

3736
03:36:51.870 --> 03:36:54.220
<v Speaker 6>this sublime spectacle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it wasn't enough.</v>

3737
03:36:54.250 --> 03:36:57.280
<v Speaker 6>He says that the soldiers refused to </v>
<v Speaker 6>fight one another.</v>

3738
03:36:57.460 --> 03:37:02.460
<v Speaker 6>What was needed was for them to turn </v>
<v Speaker 6>back on the monsters who were pushing </v>

3739
03:37:02.460 --> 03:37:02.460
<v Speaker 6>them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one against the other,</v>

3740
03:37:02.460 --> 03:37:06.070
<v Speaker 6>and to cut them down like wild beasts </v>
<v Speaker 6>for not having done so.</v>

3741
03:37:06.220 --> 03:37:09.790
<v Speaker 6>How much longer would the killing go on?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Meanwhile,</v>

3742
03:37:09.820 --> 03:37:12.970
<v Speaker 6>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our big shot leaders were in a fearer.</v>

3743
03:37:13.090 --> 03:37:16.600
<v Speaker 6>What in the Lord's name would happen if </v>
<v Speaker 6>the soldiers refused to kill each other?</v>

3744
03:37:16.810 --> 03:37:21.400
<v Speaker 6>Our artillery men received orders to </v>
<v Speaker 6>fire on any assemblies of men which were</v>

3745
03:37:21.401 --> 03:37:24.220
<v Speaker 6>pointed out to them and to mow down </v>
<v Speaker 6>indiscriminately,</v>

3746
03:37:24.221 --> 03:37:25.030
<v Speaker 6>both French,</v>
<v Speaker 6>German,</v>

3747
03:37:25.031 --> 03:37:27.910
<v Speaker 6>and Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just like when an ancient circuses,</v>

3748
03:37:28.090 --> 03:37:33.090
<v Speaker 6>they slaughtered wild beast too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're too intelligent to tear each </v>

3749
03:37:33.090 --> 03:37:33.550
<v Speaker 6>other's throats out and devour each </v>
<v Speaker 6>other.</v>

3750
03:37:34.090 --> 03:37:39.090
<v Speaker 6>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he says once the front line was </v>

3751
03:37:39.090 --> 03:37:39.090
<v Speaker 6>established,</v>
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

3752
03:37:39.090 --> 03:37:42.421
<v Speaker 6>for better or worse,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was forbidden under penalty of death </v>

3753
03:37:42.421 --> 03:37:45.631
<v Speaker 6>to leave the trench.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Any active familiarity with the Germans </v>

3754
03:37:45.631 --> 03:37:45.790
<v Speaker 6>had to cease.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was over.</v>

3755
03:37:46.060 --> 03:37:48.730
<v Speaker 6>What was really needed was a second </v>
<v Speaker 6>biblical flood,</v>

3756
03:37:48.970 --> 03:37:53.970
<v Speaker 6>a universal deleuze to stop the war,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to appease all the anger and the bloody </v>

3757
03:37:53.970 --> 03:37:55.840
<v Speaker 6>madness of our leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who knows?</v>

3758
03:37:55.841 --> 03:37:58.770
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe one day in this corner of law,</v>

3759
03:37:58.930 --> 03:38:03.930
<v Speaker 6>they will raise a monument to </v>
<v Speaker 6>commemorate this spirit of fraternity </v>

3760
03:38:03.930 --> 03:38:08.040
<v Speaker 6>among men who shared a horror of war and</v>
<v Speaker 6>who were forced to kill each other </v>

3761
03:38:08.040 --> 03:38:12.211
<v Speaker 6>against their wills and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there are multiple accounts from </v>

3762
03:38:14.270 --> 03:38:16.850
<v Speaker 6>socialists,</v>
<v Speaker 6>soldiers that sound like that,</v>

3763
03:38:17.660 --> 03:38:22.660
<v Speaker 6>but it's more complex than that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and Philip Gibbs tries to make this </v>

3764
03:38:22.660 --> 03:38:25.190
<v Speaker 6>statement and now it can be told where </v>
<v Speaker 6>he talks about this horrible life.</v>

3765
03:38:25.191 --> 03:38:27.140
<v Speaker 6>These poor soldiers are forced to </v>
<v Speaker 6>endure,</v>

3766
03:38:27.680 --> 03:38:32.680
<v Speaker 6>but then about the complexity involved </v>
<v Speaker 6>in trying to make some statement that </v>

3767
03:38:32.680 --> 03:38:34.520
<v Speaker 6>the soldiers are all of one mind or </v>
<v Speaker 6>viewpoint about anything</v>

3768
03:38:36.000 --> 03:38:36.840
<v Speaker 6>we told you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ernst,</v>

3769
03:38:36.841 --> 03:38:41.841
<v Speaker 6>Young,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or the German goes through all this </v>

3770
03:38:41.841 --> 03:38:42.210
<v Speaker 6>terrible stuff and kind of finds it </v>
<v Speaker 6>uplifting.</v>

3771
03:38:43.230 --> 03:38:48.230
<v Speaker 6>Gibbs writes these horror stories and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then says this about the psalm and the </v>

3772
03:38:48.230 --> 03:38:48.570
<v Speaker 6>soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their quote,</v>

3773
03:38:50.300 --> 03:38:52.670
<v Speaker 6>but however deep the knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 6>tragedy,</v>

3774
03:38:52.820 --> 03:38:56.540
<v Speaker 6>a man would be a liar if he refused to </v>
<v Speaker 6>admit the heroism,</v>

3775
03:38:56.750 --> 03:39:00.830
<v Speaker 6>the gallantry of youth,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even the gaiety of men in these infernal</v>

3776
03:39:00.830 --> 03:39:05.830
<v Speaker 6>months.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Psychology on the somme was not simple </v>

3777
03:39:05.830 --> 03:39:05.870
<v Speaker 6>and straightforward.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Men were afraid,</v>

3778
03:39:06.140 --> 03:39:09.620
<v Speaker 6>but fear was not there dominating </v>
<v Speaker 6>emotion except in the worst hours.</v>

3779
03:39:09.890 --> 03:39:12.950
<v Speaker 6>Men hated this fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but found excitement in it,</v>

3780
03:39:13.160 --> 03:39:18.160
<v Speaker 6>often exultation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sometimes an intense stimulus of all </v>

3781
03:39:18.160 --> 03:39:20.420
<v Speaker 6>their senses and passions before </v>
<v Speaker 6>reaction and exhaustion.</v>

3782
03:39:20.720 --> 03:39:24.680
<v Speaker 6>Men became gibbering idiots with shell </v>
<v Speaker 6>shock as I saw some of them,</v>

3783
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:29.950
<v Speaker 6>but others rejoiced when they saw our </v>
<v Speaker 6>shells plowing into the enemy's </v>

3784
03:39:29.950 --> 03:39:33.941
<v Speaker 6>earthworks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>laughed at their own narrow escapes and </v>

3785
03:39:33.941 --> 03:39:35.570
<v Speaker 6>at grotesque comma,</v>
<v Speaker 6>calories of this monster is devil tree.</v>

3786
03:39:35.930 --> 03:39:38.150
<v Speaker 6>The officers he writes were proud of </v>
<v Speaker 6>their men,</v>

3787
03:39:38.330 --> 03:39:43.330
<v Speaker 6>eager for their honor and achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The men themselves were in rivalries </v>

3788
03:39:43.330 --> 03:39:45.770
<v Speaker 6>with other bodies of troops and proud of</v>
<v Speaker 6>their own prowess.</v>

3789
03:39:46.100 --> 03:39:48.980
<v Speaker 6>They were scoring full of all that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>enemy might do to them.</v>

3790
03:39:49.200 --> 03:39:51.380
<v Speaker 6>You get acknowledged his courage and </v>
<v Speaker 6>power.</v>

3791
03:39:51.530 --> 03:39:56.530
<v Speaker 6>They were quick to kill him and yet also</v>
<v Speaker 6>quick to give him a chance of life by </v>

3792
03:39:56.530 --> 03:39:58.850
<v Speaker 6>surrender and after that we're nine </v>
<v Speaker 6>times out of 10,</v>

3793
03:39:59.030 --> 03:40:02.060
<v Speaker 6>chivalrous and kindly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but incredibly brutal.</v>

3794
03:40:02.061 --> 03:40:06.050
<v Speaker 6>On the rare occasions when passion </v>
<v Speaker 6>overcame them at some tail of treachery,</v>

3795
03:40:07.200 --> 03:40:12.200
<v Speaker 6>they had the pride of a skilled laborer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He writes in his own craft as machine </v>

3796
03:40:12.211 --> 03:40:14.580
<v Speaker 6>gunners bombers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>raider trench,</v>

3797
03:40:14.581 --> 03:40:18.060
<v Speaker 6>motor men,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we're all keen to show their skill,</v>

3798
03:40:18.061 --> 03:40:23.061
<v Speaker 6>whatever the risks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were healthy animals with animal </v>

3799
03:40:23.061 --> 03:40:25.230
<v Speaker 6>courage as well as animal fear,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they had some of them,</v>

3800
03:40:25.440 --> 03:40:28.680
<v Speaker 6>a spiritual and moral fervor which made </v>
<v Speaker 6>them risk.</v>

3801
03:40:28.681 --> 03:40:33.420
<v Speaker 6>Death to save a comrade or to save a </v>
<v Speaker 6>position would have killed the fear that</v>

3802
03:40:33.421 --> 03:40:37.050
<v Speaker 6>tried to fetter them or lead men with </v>
<v Speaker 6>greater fear than theirs.</v>

3803
03:40:37.410 --> 03:40:42.410
<v Speaker 6>They live from hour to hour and forgot </v>
<v Speaker 6>the parallel or the misery that had </v>

3804
03:40:42.410 --> 03:40:45.060
<v Speaker 6>passed and did not forestall the future </v>
<v Speaker 6>by apprehension,</v>

3805
03:40:45.210 --> 03:40:50.210
<v Speaker 6>unless they were a sensitive mind with </v>
<v Speaker 6>the worst quality men might have in </v>

3806
03:40:50.210 --> 03:40:50.250
<v Speaker 6>modern warfare,</v>

3807
03:40:50.680 --> 03:40:55.680
<v Speaker 1>imagination and to quote well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>

3808
03:40:56.831 --> 03:41:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I can see being a downside if you are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trenches under fire,</v>

3809
03:41:01.600 --> 03:41:06.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at your watch as some of these </v>

3810
03:41:06.600 --> 03:41:07.450
<v Speaker 1>troops in the trenches did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saying I have 15 minutes left to live.</v>

3811
03:41:07.600 --> 03:41:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Now I have 10 minutes left to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I have five minutes left to live as </v>

3812
03:41:12.600 --> 03:41:13.360
<v Speaker 1>the countdown to going over the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

3813
03:41:13.960 --> 03:41:18.960
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see how that would drive you </v>

3814
03:41:18.960 --> 03:41:18.960
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

3815
03:41:18.960 --> 03:41:23.280
<v Speaker 1>we're getting to the part of the war </v>
<v Speaker 1>were the really imaginative minds can </v>

3816
03:41:23.591 --> 03:41:28.591
<v Speaker 1>begin to start to have an impact on </v>
<v Speaker 1>these brand new 20th century problems.</v>

3817
03:41:29.780 --> 03:41:33.220
<v Speaker 1>It only became apparent about two years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago when this war started.</v>

3818
03:41:33.520 --> 03:41:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Some of the solutions to the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first world war you know,</v>

3819
03:41:37.511 --> 03:41:42.430
<v Speaker 1>brings into play debut during the battle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Somme and they look once again,</v>

3820
03:41:42.431 --> 03:41:45.220
<v Speaker 1>this is going to make me be a sub theme </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the show unintentionally.</v>

3821
03:41:45.670 --> 03:41:47.950
<v Speaker 1>They looked like something out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>science fiction in this case,</v>

3822
03:41:48.280 --> 03:41:53.280
<v Speaker 1>hg wells or if you want to believe some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people go all the way back to Leonardo </v>

3823
03:41:53.280 --> 03:41:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Davinci.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who first come up with the </v>

3824
03:41:58.200 --> 03:42:00.640
<v Speaker 1>concept of if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a land ship,</v>

3825
03:42:01.630 --> 03:42:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Churchill and the navy called them land </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle ships.</v>

3826
03:42:05.200 --> 03:42:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we know them by the term tank </v>
<v Speaker 1>on tank is supposedly simply something </v>

3827
03:42:12.701 --> 03:42:17.701
<v Speaker 1>that caught on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was supposed to be a cover word so </v>

3828
03:42:17.701 --> 03:42:21.241
<v Speaker 1>that no one knew what was being worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>on in secret in the laboratories of the </v>

3829
03:42:21.241 --> 03:42:26.221
<v Speaker 1>allies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would suggest that this giant </v>

3830
03:42:26.221 --> 03:42:30.030
<v Speaker 1>armored tractor was intended to bring up</v>
<v Speaker 1>supply.</v>

3831
03:42:30.031 --> 03:42:31.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like water to the front line,</v>

3832
03:42:31.801 --> 03:42:34.170
<v Speaker 1>troops under fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a tank if you will,</v>

3833
03:42:34.171 --> 03:42:39.171
<v Speaker 1>a water tank on a battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these little battles that make up</v>

3834
03:42:40.831 --> 03:42:45.831
<v Speaker 1>all these giant battles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a part of the battle of the Somme on </v>

3835
03:42:45.831 --> 03:42:48.501
<v Speaker 1>September 15th and offensive to take a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular part of the battlefield is </v>

3836
03:42:48.501 --> 03:42:51.830
<v Speaker 1>launched and debuting are a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these tanks,</v>

3837
03:42:51.840 --> 03:42:53.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 or 40,</v>

3838
03:42:53.281 --> 03:42:55.710
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bunch of them broke down on the way.</v>

3839
03:42:58.350 --> 03:43:02.730
<v Speaker 1>You can instantly see that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution to the problem,</v>

3840
03:43:02.731 --> 03:43:04.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to your engineers when the war</v>

3841
03:43:04.561 --> 03:43:05.640
<v Speaker 1>starts and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

3842
03:43:05.641 --> 03:43:10.641
<v Speaker 1>we've got this barbed wire machine gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>artillery situation with no man's land </v>

3843
03:43:10.641 --> 03:43:12.380
<v Speaker 1>and these big trenches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to get past a.</v>

3844
03:43:12.480 --> 03:43:15.120
<v Speaker 1>put your mind to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come back with a design they did.</v>

3845
03:43:15.121 --> 03:43:20.121
<v Speaker 1>They've got a giant tractor and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>long that it can span most of these </v>

3846
03:43:20.970 --> 03:43:24.420
<v Speaker 1>trenches so it can go in and not get </v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped.</v>

3847
03:43:24.421 --> 03:43:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time it only goes about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>speed of a walking human being,</v>

3848
03:43:28.441 --> 03:43:30.530
<v Speaker 1>but the point isn't to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3849
03:43:30.610 --> 03:43:35.610
<v Speaker 1>drive around real fast everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is to not get killed while </v>

3850
03:43:35.610 --> 03:43:39.060
<v Speaker 1>you're crossing no man's land and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>get held up by barbed wire.</v>

3851
03:43:39.061 --> 03:43:42.900
<v Speaker 1>These things are designed to simply run </v>
<v Speaker 1>over barbed wire machine.</v>

3852
03:43:42.901 --> 03:43:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Gun Bullets won't hurt them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shrapnel won't hurt them and they'll get</v>

3853
03:43:47.361 --> 03:43:50.420
<v Speaker 1>to the other side and they'll wipe out </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong points and when they debut,</v>

3854
03:43:50.421 --> 03:43:52.970
<v Speaker 1>nobody has any idea what that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be like.</v>

3855
03:43:53.900 --> 03:43:58.900
<v Speaker 1>It's another one of those moments where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of bite your nails and you </v>

3856
03:43:58.900 --> 03:44:01.601
<v Speaker 1>watched the new technology in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not stuff developed in the last hundred </v>

3857
03:44:02.060 --> 03:44:03.620
<v Speaker 1>years that never had a chance to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>tested.</v>

3858
03:44:03.621 --> 03:44:06.620
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff developed specifically in response</v>

3859
03:44:06.621 --> 03:44:09.050
<v Speaker 1>to problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first world war you know,</v>

3860
03:44:09.051 --> 03:44:14.051
<v Speaker 1>brings up like no man's land and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>perform astoundingly well.</v>

3861
03:44:17.740 --> 03:44:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Now they break down a lot and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly uncomfortable for the people </v>

3862
03:44:22.991 --> 03:44:24.250
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are large too.</v>

3863
03:44:24.251 --> 03:44:29.251
<v Speaker 1>There's like 15 people in these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're like almost a boss and </v>

3864
03:44:29.251 --> 03:44:31.950
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a turret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have either a machine gunner coming</v>

3865
03:44:31.980 --> 03:44:34.000
<v Speaker 1>under the side or a couple of six </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounder guns,</v>

3866
03:44:34.001 --> 03:44:39.001
<v Speaker 1>which are about 57 millimeter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet the Germans don't know what </v>

3867
03:44:39.001 --> 03:44:42.991
<v Speaker 1>they're dealing with here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'd have stories of them </v>

3868
03:44:42.991 --> 03:44:42.991
<v Speaker 1>surrendering the tanks and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3869
03:44:42.991 --> 03:44:46.740
<v Speaker 1>the reaction on the part of the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>troops is either really excited and </v>

3870
03:44:46.740 --> 03:44:49.090
<v Speaker 1>happy or they almost laughing because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks kind of comical,</v>

3871
03:44:50.030 --> 03:44:52.930
<v Speaker 1>but in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we talked about earlier.</v>

3872
03:44:52.931 --> 03:44:57.931
<v Speaker 1>This is the star wars team punk imperial</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walker thing for real</v>

3873
03:45:00.710 --> 03:45:05.710
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill and the people who had backed </v>

3874
03:45:05.710 --> 03:45:05.820
<v Speaker 1>this idea from the time trench warfare </v>
<v Speaker 1>got started.</v>

3875
03:45:05.821 --> 03:45:10.821
<v Speaker 1>That's when the first plans were drawn </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in the ideas brainstormed for </v>

3876
03:45:10.821 --> 03:45:11.700
<v Speaker 1>something like this in the French were </v>
<v Speaker 1>working on a two by the way.</v>

3877
03:45:12.960 --> 03:45:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Churchill was mad and forever afterwards</v>
<v Speaker 1>yelled and screamed that this concept </v>

3878
03:45:17.960 --> 03:45:22.641
<v Speaker 1>could have really done a ton if they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>just waited till there were enough of </v>

3879
03:45:22.641 --> 03:45:23.340
<v Speaker 1>these land battleships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3880
03:45:23.370 --> 03:45:25.440
<v Speaker 1>to unleash and have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have it make a difference.</v>

3881
03:45:25.980 --> 03:45:28.200
<v Speaker 1>The counterargument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we also understand,</v>

3882
03:45:28.201 --> 03:45:30.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what if they don't work?</v>

3883
03:45:30.251 --> 03:45:35.251
<v Speaker 1>What if we don't know how they work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we do this if we don't have a </v>

3884
03:45:35.251 --> 03:45:38.340
<v Speaker 1>dress rehearsal before opening night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so churchill and the people on his side </v>

3885
03:45:38.340 --> 03:45:38.340
<v Speaker 1>are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3886
03:45:38.340 --> 03:45:43.081
<v Speaker 1>you wasted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should've been one big opening night </v>

3887
03:45:43.081 --> 03:45:44.350
<v Speaker 1>that broke the western front and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other side saying,</v>

3888
03:45:44.351 --> 03:45:45.130
<v Speaker 1>are you kidding me?</v>

3889
03:45:45.130 --> 03:45:47.380
<v Speaker 1>There is an open invitation and Murphy's</v>
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>

3890
03:45:48.370 --> 03:45:53.370
<v Speaker 1>but if you were looking to try to decide</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you liked your land battleship </v>

3891
03:45:53.370 --> 03:45:56.770
<v Speaker 1>concept in practice after it was debuted</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the battle of the somme,</v>

3892
03:45:56.771 --> 03:45:57.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to know,</v>

3893
03:45:57.911 --> 03:46:02.911
<v Speaker 1>his cavalry commander Douglas Haig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radioed back to corporate headquarters </v>

3894
03:46:03.330 --> 03:46:08.330
<v Speaker 1>into the British army and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want more of those tanks now.</v>

3895
03:46:09.460 --> 03:46:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Other things happened because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle of the somme.</v>

3896
03:46:12.161 --> 03:46:17.161
<v Speaker 1>Two and one was it was just it for poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric von Falcon Hein,</v>

3897
03:46:17.260 --> 03:46:22.260
<v Speaker 1>the head of the German military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember he's a guy who took over after </v>

3898
03:46:22.260 --> 03:46:25.291
<v Speaker 1>they sacked von Moltke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who they started the war with </v>

3899
03:46:25.291 --> 03:46:28.110
<v Speaker 1>and now like a bunch of leaders who own </v>
<v Speaker 1>a football team and continually like to </v>

3900
03:46:29.291 --> 03:46:32.830
<v Speaker 1>change coaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Falcon Heinz going to lose his gig.</v>

3901
03:46:34.240 --> 03:46:39.240
<v Speaker 1>He's got verdun on his scorecard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now he's got the song and then there's </v>

3902
03:46:39.240 --> 03:46:43.621
<v Speaker 1>this bruce law of offensive and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last straw is everybody's whispering </v>

3903
03:46:43.621 --> 03:46:47.581
<v Speaker 1>that Romania is going to get in the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't sound like a big deal to </v>

3904
03:46:47.581 --> 03:46:51.211
<v Speaker 1>us now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you actually look at the </v>

3905
03:46:51.211 --> 03:46:51.211
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially German Austro-hungarian,</v>

3906
03:46:51.211 --> 03:46:52.120
<v Speaker 1>the stuff from that side of Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3907
03:46:52.121 --> 03:46:53.810
<v Speaker 1>they're really like biting their nails </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

3908
03:46:54.280 --> 03:46:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Romania could get in the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half million bayonets.</v>

3909
03:46:56.650 --> 03:46:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody's really worried.</v>

3910
03:46:58.601 --> 03:47:03.601
<v Speaker 1>And apparently Kaiser Wilhelm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German emperor is really worried in </v>

3911
03:47:03.601 --> 03:47:03.601
<v Speaker 1>fucking hindsight now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>

3912
03:47:03.601 --> 03:47:04.510
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to come in anytime </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>

3913
03:47:04.511 --> 03:47:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Maybe later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

3914
03:47:05.330 --> 03:47:06.550
<v Speaker 1>but no time soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then boom,</v>

3915
03:47:06.551 --> 03:47:10.320
<v Speaker 1>almost right after he issues the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't be coming in.</v>

3916
03:47:10.340 --> 03:47:14.200
<v Speaker 1>They come in August 27th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3917
03:47:14.201 --> 03:47:15.720
<v Speaker 1>and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fall behind.</v>

3918
03:47:15.760 --> 03:47:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Get sacked.</v>

3919
03:47:18.610 --> 03:47:19.990
<v Speaker 1>The last card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3920
03:47:19.991 --> 03:47:24.991
<v Speaker 1>I love how he knows his emperor William </v>
<v Speaker 1>and William's little quirks about power </v>

3921
03:47:24.991 --> 03:47:26.860
<v Speaker 1>and Falcon Heinz last car that he plays </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

3922
03:47:27.160 --> 03:47:32.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you replace me with the people </v>

3923
03:47:32.160 --> 03:47:32.160
<v Speaker 1>everyone knew they were going to replace</v>
<v Speaker 1>it with.</v>

3924
03:47:32.160 --> 03:47:33.490
<v Speaker 1>If you replaced me with Hindenburg and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ludendorff,</v>

3925
03:47:33.491 --> 03:47:34.440
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not gonna.</v>

3926
03:47:34.460 --> 03:47:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Listen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the last chance you have of having </v>

3927
03:47:39.460 --> 03:47:39.460
<v Speaker 1>an influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My words,</v>

3928
03:47:39.460 --> 03:47:40.720
<v Speaker 1>but that's basically what he said to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kaiser.</v>

3929
03:47:40.721 --> 03:47:42.130
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't have any role in this at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

3930
03:47:42.250 --> 03:47:45.550
<v Speaker 1>You better stick with me because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>put Hindenburg and Ludendorff in charge,</v>

3931
03:47:45.790 --> 03:47:47.980
<v Speaker 1>they're going to tell you to go play </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your toys in the corner.</v>

3932
03:47:49.240 --> 03:47:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Apparently the kaiser felt like he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>no choice.</v>

3933
03:47:51.880 --> 03:47:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Sacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fond Falcon Hein,</v>

3934
03:47:54.250 --> 03:47:57.820
<v Speaker 1>who asks for a military command is </v>
<v Speaker 1>given.</v>

3935
03:47:57.850 --> 03:48:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Some people think almost as an insult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the command to go attack Romania,</v>

3936
03:48:03.130 --> 03:48:05.350
<v Speaker 1>which he didn't first see them coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the war.</v>

3937
03:48:05.590 --> 03:48:10.590
<v Speaker 1>He takes over a military command and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conducts a brilliant campaign against </v>

3938
03:48:10.871 --> 03:48:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Romania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conquering them quickly,</v>

3939
03:48:14.740 --> 03:48:15.880
<v Speaker 1>which makes you turn around and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

3940
03:48:15.890 --> 03:48:18.220
<v Speaker 1>why were we so scared of those Romanian </v>
<v Speaker 1>bayonets?</v>

3941
03:48:18.520 --> 03:48:20.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not the Romanians fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3942
03:48:20.051 --> 03:48:20.680
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3943
03:48:20.710 --> 03:48:25.420
<v Speaker 1>think about how that's like a minor </v>
<v Speaker 1>league team jumping into the middle of a</v>

3944
03:48:25.421 --> 03:48:29.390
<v Speaker 1>game against the perhaps army in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>

3945
03:48:29.391 --> 03:48:32.780
<v Speaker 1>So finally Romania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So unequipped for this without a ramp up</v>

3946
03:48:32.781 --> 03:48:37.781
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they just got smashed and the worst </v>

3947
03:48:37.781 --> 03:48:37.781
<v Speaker 1>part about the whole thing from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>allied standpoint,</v>

3948
03:48:37.781 --> 03:48:39.770
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the allies worked so hard to get Romania</v>

3949
03:48:39.771 --> 03:48:42.200
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The conflict is that one's Germany takes</v>

3950
03:48:42.201 --> 03:48:44.810
<v Speaker 1>over Romania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna lose that country of every</v>

3951
03:48:44.811 --> 03:48:49.811
<v Speaker 1>bit of wheat and oil and anything they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can take to offset the damage that the </v>

3952
03:48:49.971 --> 03:48:54.971
<v Speaker 1>British blockade is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a sense it's like they come upon </v>

3953
03:48:54.971 --> 03:48:58.181
<v Speaker 1>this Romanian store room and they loot </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing so it sort of backfires </v>

3954
03:48:58.400 --> 03:49:01.940
<v Speaker 1>on the allied cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

3955
03:49:02.390 --> 03:49:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Hindenburg and Ludendorff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this new command team,</v>

3956
03:49:05.271 --> 03:49:10.271
<v Speaker 1>the people who had been in charge on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern front for so long and sort of </v>

3957
03:49:10.271 --> 03:49:14.230
<v Speaker 1>being the armchair quarterbacks from </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there telling the rest of the </v>

3958
03:49:14.230 --> 03:49:17.771
<v Speaker 1>German command what they were doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong on the western front are now in </v>

3959
03:49:17.771 --> 03:49:20.381
<v Speaker 1>charge of among other things the western</v>
<v Speaker 1>front and they're going to bring a new </v>

3960
03:49:20.511 --> 03:49:25.511
<v Speaker 1>perspective and a different way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at things and they will </v>

3961
03:49:26.510 --> 03:49:30.080
<v Speaker 1>essentially command this German army for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the war.</v>

3962
03:49:32.190 --> 03:49:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long the rest of the war is going to</v>

3963
03:49:34.351 --> 03:49:39.351
<v Speaker 1>be able to go is an open question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As 1916 begins to wind up,</v>

3964
03:49:39.691 --> 03:49:44.691
<v Speaker 1>you begin to see the discontent ramping </v>
<v Speaker 1>up everywhere and on many different </v>

3965
03:49:44.691 --> 03:49:45.930
<v Speaker 1>fronts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you begin to see,</v>

3966
03:49:45.931 --> 03:49:47.610
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger really bite,</v>

3967
03:49:47.640 --> 03:49:51.090
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the famous winter of 1916 in Germany.</v>

3968
03:49:51.091 --> 03:49:54.120
<v Speaker 1>That's called the turnip winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which tells you right there what's going</v>

3969
03:49:54.121 --> 03:49:57.270
<v Speaker 1>on and all the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the exports from Romania you can get</v>

3970
03:49:57.271 --> 03:49:58.670
<v Speaker 1>aren't going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3971
03:49:58.800 --> 03:50:02.490
<v Speaker 1>make up for the overseas important needs</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Germany.</v>

3972
03:50:04.100 --> 03:50:07.100
<v Speaker 1>The Russians are in terrible trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

3973
03:50:07.101 --> 03:50:12.101
<v Speaker 1>this is a regime that almost got </v>
<v Speaker 1>overthrown 10 years before this time </v>

3974
03:50:12.101 --> 03:50:14.870
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have exactly the greatest,</v>

3975
03:50:14.930 --> 03:50:19.220
<v Speaker 1>most solid foundation anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These million casualties,</v>

3976
03:50:19.221 --> 03:50:21.470
<v Speaker 1>they suffer in 1916 at the Bristol off </v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive.</v>

3977
03:50:21.500 --> 03:50:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Among other things are taking its toll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>French soldiers are beginning to bleed </v>

3978
03:50:28.490 --> 03:50:31.220
<v Speaker 1>like sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they pass by their officers,</v>

3979
03:50:31.221 --> 03:50:35.420
<v Speaker 1>these replacements will come up marching</v>
<v Speaker 1>by and they'll just hear bleeding.</v>

3980
03:50:35.421 --> 03:50:40.421
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like sheep and lamb being led to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the slaughter as sort of as one author </v>

3981
03:50:40.421 --> 03:50:44.891
<v Speaker 1>puts it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm way that the troops can silently </v>

3982
03:50:44.891 --> 03:50:49.691
<v Speaker 1>protest what they feel is being done to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and on the home front you can,</v>

3983
03:50:50.230 --> 03:50:55.230
<v Speaker 1>you know the tragedy is beginning to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really seep in as more and more people </v>

3984
03:50:55.230 --> 03:50:57.380
<v Speaker 1>are personally affected for life by this</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict,</v>

3985
03:50:57.381 --> 03:51:01.940
<v Speaker 1>and obviously while this isn't the </v>
<v Speaker 1>textbook example,</v>

3986
03:51:01.941 --> 03:51:06.941
<v Speaker 1>I don't think most people find </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in in the same situation as </v>

3987
03:51:06.941 --> 03:51:09.440
<v Speaker 1>this German couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a story from the time period</v>

3988
03:51:09.441 --> 03:51:14.441
<v Speaker 1>from a British observer in Germany </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the war who was describing a </v>

3989
03:51:15.051 --> 03:51:20.051
<v Speaker 1>train trip where she saw a couple man </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a woman on the train and the stories</v>

3990
03:51:20.451 --> 03:51:24.020
<v Speaker 1>absolutely heartbreaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in so many ways shows where we are.</v>

3991
03:51:24.560 --> 03:51:29.560
<v Speaker 1>By the end of 1916 in this conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the observer says,</v>

3992
03:51:30.480 --> 03:51:35.480
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how poor woman the other day on the </v>

3993
03:51:35.480 --> 03:51:36.240
<v Speaker 1>train was holding up her hand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>counting the fingers on it.</v>

3994
03:51:36.241 --> 03:51:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

3995
03:51:37.920 --> 03:51:39.420
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

3996
03:51:39.780 --> 03:51:41.490
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

3997
03:51:41.850 --> 03:51:46.850
<v Speaker 1>Over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the passengers gradually began to smile </v>

3998
03:51:46.850 --> 03:51:48.480
<v Speaker 1>at her until at last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man sitting next to her said,</v>

3999
03:51:48.481 --> 03:51:51.150
<v Speaker 1>simply don't laugh at my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

4000
03:51:51.420 --> 03:51:54.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking her to the asylum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her wits are gone.</v>

4001
03:51:54.750 --> 03:51:59.750
<v Speaker 1>She's lost her five sons all killed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>action and quote,</v>

4002
03:52:02.180 --> 03:52:05.990
<v Speaker 1>when you really examine what's already </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened since August 19,</v>

4003
03:52:05.991 --> 03:52:10.991
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come away with the feeling that if </v>

4004
03:52:10.991 --> 03:52:15.200
<v Speaker 1>you had bet on a short war like so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

4005
03:52:15.830 --> 03:52:19.280
<v Speaker 1>you are amazed at the staying power of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these states,</v>

4006
03:52:19.310 --> 03:52:24.310
<v Speaker 1>many of whom didn't look that </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly stable when the war broke </v>

4007
03:52:24.310 --> 03:52:24.680
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

4008
03:52:24.681 --> 03:52:26.480
<v Speaker 1>as we've been saying throughout this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole program,</v>

4009
03:52:26.810 --> 03:52:31.810
<v Speaker 1>there's a limit to the endurance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone and we're about to enter the </v>

4010
03:52:31.810 --> 03:52:36.791
<v Speaker 1>point when nations crack and break and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the not too distant future get </v>

4011
03:52:38.721 --> 03:52:39.410
<v Speaker 1>knocked out.</v>

4012
03:52:46.950 --> 03:52:49.170
<v Speaker 8>If you think the show you just heard is </v>
<v Speaker 8>worth a dollar,</v>

4013
03:52:49.290 --> 03:52:52.230
<v Speaker 8>Dan and Ben would love to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A buck a show.</v>

4014
03:52:52.320 --> 03:52:55.350
<v Speaker 8>It's all we ask.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Go to Dan Carlin.com</v>

4015
03:52:55.351 --> 03:52:57.840
<v Speaker 8>for information on how to donate to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>show.</v>

4016
03:52:58.420 --> 03:53:03.420
<v Speaker 1>One of the justifiable criticisms you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can level at the show we just did was </v>

4017
03:53:03.521 --> 03:53:06.400
<v Speaker 1>that it focuses in ordinarily on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>western front.</v>

4018
03:53:08.690 --> 03:53:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I did that on purpose because to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about the extremes </v>

4019
03:53:13.690 --> 03:53:18.011
<v Speaker 1>of human experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that comes to my mind </v>

4020
03:53:18.011 --> 03:53:19.991
<v Speaker 1>when I think of the first world war is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation on the western front and </v>

4021
03:53:19.991 --> 03:53:21.620
<v Speaker 1>the trench war and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in that sense I'm not that different</v>

4022
03:53:21.621 --> 03:53:26.621
<v Speaker 1>than most British,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French and German historians who have </v>

4023
03:53:26.621 --> 03:53:26.621
<v Speaker 1>focused inordinately on the western </v>
<v Speaker 1>front,</v>

4024
03:53:26.621 --> 03:53:31.600
<v Speaker 1>but I think we all know that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of other things going on in this </v>

4025
03:53:31.600 --> 03:53:34.931
<v Speaker 1>conflict in a bunch of other theaters </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the same way I was able to avoid </v>

4026
03:53:36.590 --> 03:53:38.890
<v Speaker 1>talking about those other theaters for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>

4027
03:53:38.900 --> 03:53:40.190
<v Speaker 1>My goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jumping around.</v>

4028
03:53:40.191 --> 03:53:45.191
<v Speaker 1>We would do if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we try to get everything in there </v>

4029
03:53:45.191 --> 03:53:45.410
<v Speaker 1>would be more confusing than what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>already giving you,</v>

4030
03:53:45.411 --> 03:53:47.690
<v Speaker 1>which is more confusing than I like </v>
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

4031
03:53:48.200 --> 03:53:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could ignore her just like most </v>

4032
03:53:53.200 --> 03:53:53.200
<v Speaker 1>people in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France or heck,</v>

4033
03:53:53.200 --> 03:53:54.560
<v Speaker 1>even in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the United States,</v>

4034
03:53:54.561 --> 03:53:57.710
<v Speaker 1>when you open up a newspaper and in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>far corner of like page eight,</v>

4035
03:53:57.890 --> 03:54:02.890
<v Speaker 1>there's a little blurb about maybe some </v>
<v Speaker 1>obscure Arab tribe uprising in some.</v>

4036
03:54:04.040 --> 03:54:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Out of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>autumn in district or something doesn't </v>

4037
03:54:09.040 --> 03:54:10.430
<v Speaker 1>mean that much to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not thinking that much about it.</v>

4038
03:54:10.431 --> 03:54:12.890
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the western front is grinding up a whole</v>

4039
03:54:12.891 --> 03:54:17.891
<v Speaker 1>generation of Europeans and then in 1917</v>
<v Speaker 1>events in faraway peripheral places is </v>

4040
03:54:20.541 --> 03:54:25.541
<v Speaker 1>the way a lot of people in the West </v>
<v Speaker 1>might see them rise up and demand to be </v>

4041
03:54:25.541 --> 03:54:26.230
<v Speaker 1>taken seriously,</v>

4042
03:54:28.590 --> 03:54:33.590
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the Middle East in 1917 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>events that we are still shaking out to </v>

4043
03:54:34.381 --> 03:54:37.050
<v Speaker 1>this day that are in your headlines </v>
<v Speaker 1>daily,</v>

4044
03:54:37.740 --> 03:54:42.740
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the collapse of an ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>European regime which opens the door to </v>

4045
03:54:46.050 --> 03:54:51.050
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century's most radical regime </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking over in a major country.</v>

4046
03:54:54.340 --> 03:54:59.340
<v Speaker 1>So also in 1917 that the vortex of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war manages to suck in an </v>

4047
03:55:00.811 --> 03:55:05.811
<v Speaker 1>outside major power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That for almost a 150 years has managed </v>

4048
03:55:06.941 --> 03:55:10.720
<v Speaker 1>to stay out of direct involvement in </v>
<v Speaker 1>European affairs.</v>

4049
03:55:10.721 --> 03:55:13.780
<v Speaker 1>As one of their early presidents had </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

4050
03:55:14.350 --> 03:55:19.350
<v Speaker 1>the United States of America doesn't go </v>
<v Speaker 1>abroad in search of foreign monsters to </v>

4051
03:55:19.350 --> 03:55:24.241
<v Speaker 1>slay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in 1917 they decide we'll maybe just</v>

4052
03:55:24.311 --> 03:55:26.260
<v Speaker 1>this once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4053
03:55:26.680 --> 03:55:31.680
<v Speaker 1>to make the world safe for democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

4054
03:55:31.751 --> 03:55:36.751
<v Speaker 1>indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of our modern situations had the </v>

4055
03:55:36.971 --> 03:55:41.971
<v Speaker 1>seeds for them planted in 1917.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll get to all that and more in </v>

4056
03:55:46.001 --> 03:55:48.820
<v Speaker 1>part five of blueprint for Armageddon.</v>
