00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.250
<v Speaker 1>What you're about to hear is the sixth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and final part of a six part series on </v>

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.400
<v Speaker 1>the first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Traditionally,</v>

3
00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:08.290
<v Speaker 1>we suggest people listen to them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

4
00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:13.291
<v Speaker 1>but I realize not everyone's traditional</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there may be a few historical </v>

5
00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:15.790
<v Speaker 1>dyslexics out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that's the case,</v>

6
00:00:15.791 --> 00:00:17.980
<v Speaker 1>it might not matter to you the order you</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen in.</v>

7
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.070
<v Speaker 1>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please feel free to jump right in.</v>

8
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.380
<v Speaker 1>And for those of you who've heard the </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous episodes,</v>

9
00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:26.860
<v Speaker 1>welcome back to part six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we said,</v>

10
00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:31.861
<v Speaker 1>the final part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not counting an extra show of blueprint </v>

11
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:31.930
<v Speaker 1>for Armageddon,</v>

12
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 2>be some bus seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

13
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.930
<v Speaker 2>41 date which will live in infamy.</v>

14
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Eats</v>

15
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.530
<v Speaker 2>quiet please.</v>

16
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>The events</v>

17
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 3>that dude the figure from this time and </v>
<v Speaker 3>place,</v>

18
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 3>I take pride in the words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>been the Alina,</v>

19
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.690
<v Speaker 3>tear down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>complete collapse.</v>

20
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.900
<v Speaker 3>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>welcome.</v>

21
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:32.901
<v Speaker 3>This kind of examination because people </v>
<v Speaker 3>have got to know whether or not their </v>

22
00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:34.130
<v Speaker 3>president question well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a crop.</v>

23
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.380
<v Speaker 3>If we dig deep in our history and our </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctrine and remember we are not </v>

24
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 3>descended from fearful of man.</v>

25
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.030
<v Speaker 1>It's hardcore history.</v>

26
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>What's the most dangerous weapon in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>

27
00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.090
<v Speaker 1>I've had this discussion many times with</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people and I've seen it go all over</v>

28
00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:05.091
<v Speaker 1>the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but generally you focus on nuclear </v>

29
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:07.941
<v Speaker 1>weapons because that's an obvious thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to put in the number one spot for most </v>

30
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>dangerous weapon in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are some that are a little bit</v>

31
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:12.210
<v Speaker 1>more in city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't potentially worse.</v>

32
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Take for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological weapons.</v>

33
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Think about some of the worst plagues </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have ever infested mankind.</v>

34
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.730
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine human ingenuity and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>laboratory use to make such plagues </v>

35
00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>worse and now imagine releasing those </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon your enemy.</v>

36
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.170
<v Speaker 1>The reason they're so extra dangerous is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the way they spread and the </v>

37
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.900
<v Speaker 1>fact that once you open the Pandora's </v>
<v Speaker 1>box of biological warfare,</v>

38
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.660
<v Speaker 1>you generally lose the ability to shut </v>
<v Speaker 1>the box.</v>

39
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:47.661
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may exchange a few nuclear weapons </v>

40
00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:50.781
<v Speaker 1>with an opponent and decide to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you open up that box and unleashed </v>

41
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.200
<v Speaker 1>super small pox or what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't turn that off.</v>

42
00:02:55.201 --> 00:03:00.201
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another reason it's very dangerous is </v>

43
00:03:00.201 --> 00:03:02.781
<v Speaker 1>that super smallpox doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiate between the people you </v>

44
00:03:02.781 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>targeted and everyone else that it may </v>
<v Speaker 1>spread to.</v>

45
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit of a doomsday device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about how something like </v>

46
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 1>that could backfire on the very people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who decide to use it,</v>

47
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a little like deciding to get rid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your next door neighbor in your </v>

48
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.400
<v Speaker 1>apartment complex by burning down his </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

49
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.410
<v Speaker 1>The potential for the fire to hurt you </v>
<v Speaker 1>is very real,</v>

50
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes if you've run out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>options,</v>

51
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:31.021
<v Speaker 1>gambling like that might make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In late 1917 where we are in this story,</v>

52
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>even though we've been using sliding </v>
<v Speaker 1>timescale,</v>

53
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 1>that's about where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In late 1917,</v>

54
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:42.451
<v Speaker 1>the Germans are desperate enough to try </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things including the </v>

55
00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:46.921
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of biological warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead of using some sort of </v>

56
00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 1>contagious disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're using contagious ideas,</v>

57
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.340
<v Speaker 1>but you might be able to make a case </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in this situation an actual disease</v>

58
00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:57.850
<v Speaker 1>would have been preferable.</v>

59
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I think about this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about Napoleon,</v>

60
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.480
<v Speaker 1>the famous French emperor from late 17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds,</v>

61
00:04:05.481 --> 00:04:08.390
<v Speaker 1>early 18 hundreds who was such a force </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Europe.</v>

62
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon was someone who spread and </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual contagion and I remember </v>

63
00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:18.980
<v Speaker 1>professors in college suggesting that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this was the thing that scared the kings</v>

64
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 1>and czars and emperors of Europe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most about Napoleon because Napoleon </v>

65
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.910
<v Speaker 1>arose in the wake of the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution,</v>

66
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.160
<v Speaker 1>the era where Frenchman were infused </v>
<v Speaker 1>with these ideas of revolution,</v>

67
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.040
<v Speaker 1>of equality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Republican Ism,</v>

68
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 1>all these things that seem in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively moderate to people today,</v>

69
00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:44.321
<v Speaker 1>even beneficial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those were the scariest things on </v>

70
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:47.861
<v Speaker 1>earth to people who were kings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>emperors and czars and many of them </v>

71
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:51.761
<v Speaker 1>figured that they would eventually be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to throw the French out of these </v>

72
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:55.511
<v Speaker 1>territories and get their thrones back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were less sure about their </v>

73
00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:59.801
<v Speaker 1>ability to cleanse their population of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these dangerous radical ideas that </v>

74
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:02.000
<v Speaker 1>French occupying troops had spread to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

75
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many historians believe that the famous </v>

76
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary period in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 hundreds was the blossoming of seeds </v>

77
00:05:11.931 --> 00:05:16.931
<v Speaker 1>that were planted by Napoleon's troops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As they occupied all these countries </v>

78
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>talk to the locals and spread the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of an intellectual contagion.</v>

79
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.530
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're one of those types who would </v>

80
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.331
<v Speaker 1>view the ideas of the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution or the French revolution or </v>

81
00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:35.171
<v Speaker 1>the ideas of the thinkers who helped </v>
<v Speaker 1>prompt those revolutions as a negative </v>

82
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:37.580
<v Speaker 1>thing than perhaps you would view the 18</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds as an example,</v>

83
00:05:37.581 --> 00:05:40.130
<v Speaker 1>not of a seed flowering into some </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful plant,</v>

84
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.550
<v Speaker 1>but as a virus beginning to morph and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutate and evolve into new and maybe </v>

85
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.950
<v Speaker 1>more dangerous forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 18 hundreds is up until that time </v>

86
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.810
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost certainly the greatest period for</v>

87
00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.140
<v Speaker 1>intellectual examination of forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ever existed and part of it is </v>

88
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 1>because of the increase in communication</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how people all over Europe can begin</v>

89
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:07.931
<v Speaker 1>to have conferences and discussions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>write for magazines and newspapers that </v>

90
00:06:07.931 --> 00:06:11.711
<v Speaker 1>each other reeds and have all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempts at trying to apply rationality </v>

91
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.380
<v Speaker 1>and logic to the idea of government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because most of the governments in a </v>

92
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.941
<v Speaker 1>place like Europe at this time period </v>
<v Speaker 1>are things that have existed in one form</v>

93
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 1>or another for centuries.</v>

94
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some one in the distant past was a great</v>

95
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:35.861
<v Speaker 1>military leader who establishes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynasty who rules for hundreds of years </v>

96
00:06:35.861 --> 00:06:40.571
<v Speaker 1>and no one ever really asks whether or </v>
<v Speaker 1>not that's the right thing to do or </v>

97
00:06:40.571 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it's smart or anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

98
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.590
<v Speaker 1>In the 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people began to think along with changes</v>

99
00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:50.591
<v Speaker 1>in science and all kinds of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that may be people could come up </v>

100
00:06:50.591 --> 00:06:54.911
<v Speaker 1>with smarter approaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was wide disagreement though </v>

101
00:06:54.911 --> 00:06:58.961
<v Speaker 1>on what that smart approach might be and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the great figures of the 18 </v>

102
00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:02.831
<v Speaker 1>hundreds who played roles in this would </v>
<v Speaker 1>become extremely important figures in </v>

103
00:07:02.831 --> 00:07:04.820
<v Speaker 1>the 19 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

104
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.150
<v Speaker 1>someone who was involved in trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with a system that seemed to be </v>

105
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.141
<v Speaker 1>an improvement over what Europe was </v>
<v Speaker 1>living with in the 18 hundreds explodes </v>

106
00:07:14.141 --> 00:07:18.431
<v Speaker 1>in importance in 1917 exactly where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are in this first world war story.</v>

107
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.270
<v Speaker 1>He was renowned in his own day within </v>
<v Speaker 1>his own circles,</v>

108
00:07:24.271 --> 00:07:25.980
<v Speaker 1>but he certainly wasn't a household </v>
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>

109
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 1>He becomes a historical superstar in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1917 and there's a little bit of irony.</v>

110
00:07:31.771 --> 00:07:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Did that because in 1917,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this figure has been dead 34,</v>

111
00:07:36.091 --> 00:07:37.260
<v Speaker 1>35 years,</v>

112
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.370
<v Speaker 1>one of the best or one of the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of an idea,</v>

113
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.620
<v Speaker 1>depending on whether you consider a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>or dangerous,</v>

114
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.920
<v Speaker 1>is the fact that it doesn't die with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>originator.</v>

115
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.480
<v Speaker 1>In 1917,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden everybody starts hearing</v>

116
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:58.481
<v Speaker 1>the name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karl Marx marks is often credited with </v>

117
00:07:58.481 --> 00:08:02.971
<v Speaker 1>being the originator of modern communism</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Marxism,</v>

118
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.910
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's probably giving him a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little too much credit after all,</v>

119
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:12.180
<v Speaker 1>very few people come up with ideas out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of nowhere and marked like most people </v>

120
00:08:12.521 --> 00:08:15.250
<v Speaker 1>stood on the shoulders of giants with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his ideas.</v>

121
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.190
<v Speaker 1>He was reading guys like the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher,</v>

122
00:08:18.191 --> 00:08:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Hegel and a lot of other people,</v>

123
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.540
<v Speaker 1>but if a guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

124
00:08:22.541 --> 00:08:27.541
<v Speaker 1>goals and example of the intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>contagion than mark's is an example of </v>

125
00:08:27.541 --> 00:08:32.481
<v Speaker 1>someone who mutated it further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course perhaps the ironic tragedy</v>

126
00:08:34.411 --> 00:08:39.411
<v Speaker 1>of marks is that Marx didn't get to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the implementer of his ideas.</v>

127
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:44.900
<v Speaker 1>His ideas were adapted and morphed into </v>
<v Speaker 1>different forms.</v>

128
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Like many figures from history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could go back and show Karl Marx </v>

129
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 1>how he's treated in the history books </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the things associated with,</v>

130
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:01.910
<v Speaker 1>I think he might jump off a bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of figures like that who </v>

131
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:06.231
<v Speaker 1>are remembered for things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost a 180 degrees different than what</v>

132
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:11.871
<v Speaker 1>they devoted their lives to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Working for Marx thought he was doing </v>

133
00:09:11.871 --> 00:09:14.811
<v Speaker 1>good and yet today we think about his </v>
<v Speaker 1>role in the deaths of tens of millions </v>

134
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.320
<v Speaker 1>of people and the creation of some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst slave states in all human </v>

135
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.371
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you read Marx and find out what he </v>

136
00:09:25.371 --> 00:09:29.991
<v Speaker 1>was all about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what he was hoping to </v>

137
00:09:29.991 --> 00:09:34.010
<v Speaker 1>prevent and stop and eliminate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could bring Carl Marx back from the </v>

138
00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:37.370
<v Speaker 1>dead and have him analyze where things </v>
<v Speaker 1>went wrong.</v>

139
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:42.670
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be surprised at all if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>blamed a botched implementation for the </v>

140
00:09:44.181 --> 00:09:49.181
<v Speaker 1>way things turned out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We might argue that Marx's ideas from </v>

141
00:09:49.181 --> 00:09:52.091
<v Speaker 1>the get go were poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think he would probably say that </v>

142
00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:55.031
<v Speaker 1>you never got a chance to see what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted because he wasn't the guy that </v>

143
00:09:55.031 --> 00:09:56.030
<v Speaker 1>built the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the architect.</v>

144
00:09:56.031 --> 00:09:58.610
<v Speaker 1>May Be or maybe the last guy to design </v>
<v Speaker 1>blueprints.</v>

145
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.710
<v Speaker 1>The guy who actually built the dwelling </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a guy named Vladimir Lenin</v>

146
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:07.480
<v Speaker 1>and I'm reminded of a quote by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>writer,</v>

147
00:10:07.481 --> 00:10:12.481
<v Speaker 1>Algiers Huxley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how ideas end up influencing </v>

148
00:10:12.481 --> 00:10:17.311
<v Speaker 1>people and it's not so much a question </v>
<v Speaker 1>always of how many people but who they </v>

149
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:19.580
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huxley wrote quote,</v>

150
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.800
<v Speaker 1>it is possible to argue that the really </v>
<v Speaker 1>influential book is not that which </v>

151
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.001
<v Speaker 1>converts 10 millions of casual readers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather that which converts the very </v>

152
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.350
<v Speaker 1>few who at any given moment succeed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>seizing power marks and sorrel have been</v>

153
00:10:35.351 --> 00:10:40.351
<v Speaker 1>influential in the modern world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so much because they were best </v>

154
00:10:40.351 --> 00:10:41.800
<v Speaker 1>sellers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because among their few readers were</v>

155
00:10:41.801 --> 00:10:46.801
<v Speaker 1>two men called respectively Lennon and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mussolini and quote</v>

156
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.960
<v Speaker 1>Vladimir Lenin is the hinge point </v>
<v Speaker 1>between theory and application.</v>

157
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.470
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to modern day communism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the implementer.</v>

158
00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:03.471
<v Speaker 1>If mark's is the originator than Lennon </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the implementer and he's a figure </v>

159
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:08.630
<v Speaker 1>that combines some rather unusual </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities in one human being.</v>

160
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes the intellectual and the deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinker and the philosopher is a </v>

161
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.770
<v Speaker 1>different sort of human being than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>person of action.</v>

162
00:11:16.771 --> 00:11:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've heard of the man of action,</v>

163
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.030
<v Speaker 1>and oftentimes there are two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of people.</v>

164
00:11:21.031 --> 00:11:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Lenin is one of these strange </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals that possesses the qualities</v>

165
00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:27.570
<v Speaker 1>of both an intellectual and a person of </v>
<v Speaker 1>action,</v>

166
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:33.290
<v Speaker 1>and his dynamic abilities were </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognized even by the people who were </v>

167
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.430
<v Speaker 1>his opponents and take for example the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description of Lloyd George,</v>

168
00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:43.431
<v Speaker 1>the man who is the prime minister of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain during the second half of the </v>

169
00:11:43.431 --> 00:11:47.181
<v Speaker 1>first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George will write his memoirs in the </v>

170
00:11:47.181 --> 00:11:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen Thirties and he will say this </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Latimer Lennon quote,</v>

171
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:54.860
<v Speaker 1>he was a communist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Wilson fanaticism does not always </v>

172
00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.140
<v Speaker 1>endow it's possessor with great </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrative ability.</v>

173
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.880
<v Speaker 1>It is not incompatible with a genius for</v>
<v Speaker 1>government and no one can doubt that.</v>

174
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:05.881
<v Speaker 1>Lennon was one of the greatest leaders </v>
<v Speaker 1>of men ever thrown up in any epic and </v>

175
00:12:05.881 --> 00:12:05.881
<v Speaker 1>the quote.</v>

176
00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.200
<v Speaker 1>He then goes on to compare him to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>he calls a plague.</v>

177
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Bacillus.</v>

178
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Lenin was certainly a fanatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most revolutionaries are people who tend</v>

179
00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:21.580
<v Speaker 1>to not see too many shades of gray </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

180
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:26.581
<v Speaker 1>tend to be black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Winston Churchill famously defined a </v>

181
00:12:26.581 --> 00:12:29.950
<v Speaker 1>fanatic is someone who can't change </v>
<v Speaker 1>their mind and won't change the subject,</v>

182
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.720
<v Speaker 1>and Churchill had his own opinion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lenin and once again it evoked this idea</v>

183
00:12:34.721 --> 00:12:39.721
<v Speaker 1>of an intellectual contagion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also compared len into some sort of </v>

184
00:12:39.721 --> 00:12:43.531
<v Speaker 1>bacteria and he blamed the Germans for </v>
<v Speaker 1>unleashing it on Europe,</v>

185
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:50.640
<v Speaker 1>playing an active role in implementing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>form of germ warfare that would have </v>

186
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.590
<v Speaker 1>horrible effects down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill wrote,</v>

187
00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:01.620
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lennon was sent into Russia by the </v>

188
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.291
<v Speaker 1>Germans in the same way that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>send a file containing a culture of </v>

189
00:13:04.291 --> 00:13:08.310
<v Speaker 1>typhoid or Colorado to be poured in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>water supply of a great city and it </v>

190
00:13:08.351 --> 00:13:13.351
<v Speaker 1>worked with amazing accuracy and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That brings us to the third person who </v>

191
00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:19.681
<v Speaker 1>was very important in implementing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual contagion.</v>

192
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Warfare kind of approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The facilitator.</v>

193
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.040
<v Speaker 1>If march is the originator and linen is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the implementer,</v>

194
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Lennon needed some help to get to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where he could.</v>

195
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.730
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>

196
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
<v Speaker 1>anyone in the beginning of 1917,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vladimir Lenin is in exile.</v>

197
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.200
<v Speaker 1>He's living in Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next to a sausage factory on the second </v>

198
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.181
<v Speaker 1>floor of a rented flat with his wife </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to make a living in what you </v>

199
00:13:52.091 --> 00:13:55.840
<v Speaker 1>might call the professional </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary business.</v>

200
00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.800
<v Speaker 1>He'd like to get back to Russia in 1917 </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's apparent that huge things </v>

201
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.100
<v Speaker 1>are happening in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The czar has been overthrown.</v>

202
00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:08.101
<v Speaker 1>A provisional government is taken over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Lenin can't get from where he is to </v>

203
00:14:08.171 --> 00:14:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a war going on and there's a lot</v>

204
00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:14.350
<v Speaker 1>of territory in between Switzerland and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia to deal with,</v>

205
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.780
<v Speaker 1>and then he gets some help from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitator,</v>

206
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:25.300
<v Speaker 1>the leader of Germany's military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for the most part by this time,</v>

207
00:14:25.301 --> 00:14:27.700
<v Speaker 1>civilian government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric Luton,</v>

208
00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Dorf Ludin</v>

209
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.020
<v Speaker 1>door from the Germans have long been </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with Lennon's rise to power.</v>

210
00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:41.500
<v Speaker 1>The exact amount of responsibility that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany has in that story is debatable </v>

211
00:14:42.741 --> 00:14:47.741
<v Speaker 1>and has been debated since 1917.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons historians have a </v>

212
00:14:48.411 --> 00:14:53.411
<v Speaker 1>hard time nailing down definitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>answers is because it's one of those </v>

213
00:14:53.411 --> 00:14:58.151
<v Speaker 1>things that falls into the category of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we would call today covert </v>

214
00:14:58.151 --> 00:15:02.600
<v Speaker 1>operations or black ops top secret </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

215
00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:07.601
<v Speaker 1>both sides in the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to undermine the </v>

216
00:15:07.601 --> 00:15:10.811
<v Speaker 1>cohesiveness and the stability of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>opponents and it potentially wonderful </v>

217
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:16.091
<v Speaker 1>way to do that was to give money or arms</v>
<v Speaker 1>or sometimes military advisors to </v>

218
00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:21.761
<v Speaker 1>revolutionaries and insurrectionists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>break away groups and ethnic separatists</v>

219
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:28.630
<v Speaker 1>and people who lived in countries that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were colonies of some of the great </v>

220
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.931
<v Speaker 1>powers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who wanted their independence and </v>

221
00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:31.931
<v Speaker 1>both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>

222
00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:34.691
<v Speaker 1>we're doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of allegations about </v>

223
00:15:34.691 --> 00:15:35.330
<v Speaker 1>German involvement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

224
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.200
<v Speaker 1>in the famous Easter rising in 1916 in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland,</v>

225
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:42.350
<v Speaker 1>how much German support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's questionable too,</v>

226
00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:46.040
<v Speaker 1>and part of the reason why is nobody was</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly advertising.</v>

227
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Now these top secret affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the stories trace German </v>

228
00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:55.890
<v Speaker 1>involvement at least as far back as </v>
<v Speaker 1>1915.</v>

229
00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Most of those stories suggests that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was contacts with leftist individuals </v>

230
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:06.141
<v Speaker 1>who pointed out to the German government</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there were shared goals on the part</v>

231
00:16:06.601 --> 00:16:10.140
<v Speaker 1>of Germany and some of these Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary figures</v>

232
00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:12.990
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

233
00:16:12.991 --> 00:16:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Lennon and his particular offshoot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Communist,</v>

234
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream known as the Bolsheviks.</v>

235
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.010
<v Speaker 1>One of the things Lennon was calling for</v>
<v Speaker 1>was peace.</v>

236
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.400
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what the Germans wanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Russians.</v>

237
00:16:26.401 --> 00:16:30.420
<v Speaker 1>By 1917,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted the Russians out of the war.</v>

238
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:36.610
<v Speaker 1>The Russians were tying down millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>German troops on the eastern front that </v>

239
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:41.591
<v Speaker 1>the Germans would love to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>switch over to the western front to </v>

240
00:16:41.591 --> 00:16:43.940
<v Speaker 1>fight the exhausted French and British </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the Americans arrived in any sort</v>

241
00:16:43.941 --> 00:16:46.430
<v Speaker 1>of decisive numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

242
00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:50.060
<v Speaker 1>the big gamble here of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the Bolsheviks,</v>

243
00:16:50.061 --> 00:16:54.980
<v Speaker 1>while they may share a common goal in </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting Russia to leave the war,</v>

244
00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.640
<v Speaker 1>are not Germany's friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luton Dorf deciding to use them as a </v>

245
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.961
<v Speaker 1>tool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is akin to adding another boxer into the</v>

246
00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:06.200
<v Speaker 1>World War One.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boxing match.</v>

247
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.600
<v Speaker 1>We've used that analogy throughout this </v>
<v Speaker 1>series.</v>

248
00:17:08.601 --> 00:17:10.610
<v Speaker 1>The idea of two boxers fighting each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

249
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Part of Lewandowski gamble here is he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about introducing a third </v>

250
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:20.681
<v Speaker 1>box or into the ring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that wants to fight both the other </v>

251
00:17:20.681 --> 00:17:24.191
<v Speaker 1>two boxers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Luton Dorf has a pretty good idea </v>

252
00:17:24.191 --> 00:17:26.780
<v Speaker 1>that he'll go after the one Ludin door </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Germans are fighting first,</v>

253
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:33.090
<v Speaker 1>the Bolsheviks and Lennon or preaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>the equivalent of a global civil war.</v>

254
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.720
<v Speaker 1>If the American president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woodrow Wilson is calling the first </v>

255
00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.360
<v Speaker 1>world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war to end all wars,</v>

256
00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Lennon has his own idea of the war to </v>
<v Speaker 1>end all wars is Irish historian William </v>

257
00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Mulligan points out Lennon's idea of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>war to end all is revolutionary war.</v>

258
00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:58.240
<v Speaker 1>The Bolsheviks are calling for the poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the working classes of all nations </v>

259
00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.840
<v Speaker 1>to rise up and overthrow their rulers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany is only a little less vulnerable</v>

260
00:18:02.841 --> 00:18:04.760
<v Speaker 1>to that sort of message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Russia is.</v>

261
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.330
<v Speaker 1>This is why Ludina Dorf is playing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire,</v>

262
00:18:08.331 --> 00:18:13.331
<v Speaker 1>or in this case play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stands a really good chance of </v>

263
00:18:13.331 --> 00:18:17.861
<v Speaker 1>getting burned by this very same weapon </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he in 1917 decides to help use </v>

264
00:18:19.761 --> 00:18:24.761
<v Speaker 1>against Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actual means to get Lennon from </v>

265
00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland back to Russia is provided </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the Germans in April 19,</v>

266
00:18:29.961 --> 00:18:31.940
<v Speaker 1>17.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going backwards a little bit in</v>

267
00:18:31.941 --> 00:18:32.570
<v Speaker 1>this story.</v>

268
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:39.940
<v Speaker 1>The Germans provide a single sealed </v>
<v Speaker 1>train car for Lennon and his cohorts.</v>

269
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Historians have disagreed over who had </v>
<v Speaker 1>demanded that EBC yield.</v>

270
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Some say the Germans wanted this train </v>
<v Speaker 1>car sealed so that when Lennon and his </v>

271
00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.211
<v Speaker 1>cohorts are going through Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't intellectually infect the </v>

272
00:18:55.211 --> 00:18:58.541
<v Speaker 1>Germans on the way through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others say it was Lenin and the </v>

273
00:18:58.541 --> 00:19:01.541
<v Speaker 1>Bolsheviks who demanded it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last thing that they wanted was to </v>

274
00:19:01.541 --> 00:19:03.950
<v Speaker 1>have people in Russia find out that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were accepting help from the country.</v>

275
00:19:03.951 --> 00:19:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Russia was fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

276
00:19:05.991 --> 00:19:10.991
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who happen to be capitalists to </v>

277
00:19:10.991 --> 00:19:12.860
<v Speaker 1>nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whomever it was who made the decision as</v>

278
00:19:12.861 --> 00:19:17.861
<v Speaker 1>the train car goes through Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a famous incident where Lennon </v>

279
00:19:17.861 --> 00:19:20.981
<v Speaker 1>or one of his cohorts looks out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>window and happens to notice that there </v>

280
00:19:20.981 --> 00:19:25.361
<v Speaker 1>are no mature men anywhere to be seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's children and women and old people.</v>

281
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Germany's mature male population is </v>
<v Speaker 1>either dead or wounded or at the fronts,</v>

282
00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Lennon in his party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we'll have to board a ferry and go </v>

283
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:41.860
<v Speaker 1>by boat for a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they'll get back on another train.</v>

284
00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:46.780
<v Speaker 1>The train will then arrive in Petrograd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>formerly St Petersburg,</v>

285
00:19:46.781 --> 00:19:50.020
<v Speaker 1>the Russian capital just before midnight</v>
<v Speaker 1>on April 16th,</v>

286
00:19:50.021 --> 00:19:54.010
<v Speaker 1>1917.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There will be a crowd waiting to welcome</v>

287
00:19:54.011 --> 00:19:57.550
<v Speaker 1>him because like many other dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>radicals,</v>

288
00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Lenin is coming home from exile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Tsar for decades had been exiled and</v>

289
00:20:02.871 --> 00:20:07.871
<v Speaker 1>all these very formidable intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>contagions and those are the ones he </v>

290
00:20:08.111 --> 00:20:09.700
<v Speaker 1>wasn't executing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

291
00:20:09.701 --> 00:20:12.220
<v Speaker 1>Lennon's brother had been executed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the czar.</v>

292
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Now all these people were coming back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia at roughly the same time creating</v>

293
00:20:17.681 --> 00:20:22.681
<v Speaker 1>a seditious soup politically speaking in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia during this time period and </v>

294
00:20:23.171 --> 00:20:24.910
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia was ready for it.</v>

295
00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:30.790
<v Speaker 1>They're in this precarious situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the czar falls where you have sort</v>

296
00:20:30.791 --> 00:20:35.791
<v Speaker 1>of a moderate government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm known as the provisional government </v>

297
00:20:35.791 --> 00:20:40.261
<v Speaker 1>sharing power with these groups of </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers and peasants and workers who </v>

298
00:20:41.051 --> 00:20:46.051
<v Speaker 1>have gotten together and elected leaders</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who are sort of trying to lead from </v>

299
00:20:46.051 --> 00:20:50.341
<v Speaker 1>the bottom and they're sharing power and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not very comfortable sort of an </v>

300
00:20:50.341 --> 00:20:51.010
<v Speaker 1>arrangement with the provisional </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

301
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:56.460
<v Speaker 1>It is absolutely a setup for problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet you kind of have to feel a </v>

302
00:20:56.681 --> 00:20:58.180
<v Speaker 1>little bit for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

303
00:20:58.181 --> 00:21:00.400
<v Speaker 1>think about what these people are trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

304
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:05.730
<v Speaker 1>They are trying to run a country after </v>
<v Speaker 1>toppling the regime that had been in </v>

305
00:21:06.701 --> 00:21:11.701
<v Speaker 1>power for centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a tough thing to do in the best </v>

306
00:21:11.701 --> 00:21:14.020
<v Speaker 1>of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this isn't the best of times.</v>

307
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:19.170
<v Speaker 1>This is the equivalent of a bus </v>
<v Speaker 1>passenger trying to get ahold of the </v>

308
00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:22.291
<v Speaker 1>wheel when the bus is already careening </v>
<v Speaker 1>off a cliff and then you get a guy like </v>

309
00:21:22.291 --> 00:21:26.050
<v Speaker 1>lennon arriving and he gets off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform at a little before midnight and</v>

310
00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:28.420
<v Speaker 1>tells this enthusiastic crowd of </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporters.</v>

311
00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:34.740
<v Speaker 1>The periodical imperialist war is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of a civil war throughout </v>

312
00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.331
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worldwide socialist revolution has </v>

313
00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:41.200
<v Speaker 1>already dawned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany is seizing any day now.</v>

314
00:21:41.201 --> 00:21:43.870
<v Speaker 1>The whole of European capitalism may </v>
<v Speaker 1>crash.</v>

315
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Sailors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comrades.</v>

316
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.880
<v Speaker 1>We have to fight for a socialist </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution to fight until the </v>

317
00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.151
<v Speaker 1>proletariat winds fold victory long live</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worldwide socialist revolution and </v>

318
00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:59.930
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even Lennon's friends thought this way </v>

319
00:22:00.461 --> 00:22:03.370
<v Speaker 1>too optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

320
00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:08.850
<v Speaker 1>at that very moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the current Russian government power </v>

321
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:12.781
<v Speaker 1>sharing arrangement was trying to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and offensive against the </v>

322
00:22:12.781 --> 00:22:17.401
<v Speaker 1>Germans scheduled for July first with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>army that was sketchy at best.</v>

323
00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:24.871
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are Russia's provisional </v>

324
00:22:24.871 --> 00:22:25.660
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are between a rock and a hard place.</v>

325
00:22:25.661 --> 00:22:29.290
<v Speaker 1>In 1917,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are barely holding onto power.</v>

326
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:31.510
<v Speaker 1>You have strikes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have unrest,</v>

327
00:22:31.511 --> 00:22:36.511
<v Speaker 1>you have all kinds of problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now you have lennon here taking the </v>

328
00:22:36.511 --> 00:22:39.991
<v Speaker 1>already kind of extreme bolsheviks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing them into greater extremism.</v>

329
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:45.930
<v Speaker 1>He's calling for three main things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are impossible for the provisional </v>

330
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:48.190
<v Speaker 1>government to really contend with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is calling for peace,</v>

331
00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:53.550
<v Speaker 1>bread and land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a triple threat of a message that would </v>

332
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:58.351
<v Speaker 1>be effective across much of Europe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1917 and you have the provisional </v>

333
00:22:58.931 --> 00:23:00.370
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

334
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:06.510
<v Speaker 1>it has to prove to the British and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French that it's still a viable partner </v>

335
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:06.510
<v Speaker 1>in this war.</v>

336
00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.100
<v Speaker 1>They're funneling tons of subsidies to </v>
<v Speaker 1>this government.</v>

337
00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:14.910
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to convince the Germans and </v>

338
00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.200
<v Speaker 1>the central powers of the same fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just assume we're done and the</v>

339
00:23:17.201 --> 00:23:19.390
<v Speaker 1>best way to do that is to launch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>

340
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:25.080
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that this army might </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been willing to stay and defend </v>

341
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:30.600
<v Speaker 1>mother Russia soil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of them are not willing to go </v>

342
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.561
<v Speaker 1>on the offensive and run into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine guns and artillery barrages of </v>

343
00:23:34.561 --> 00:23:38.311
<v Speaker 1>the Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may not give a hoot about </v>

344
00:23:38.311 --> 00:23:41.590
<v Speaker 1>bolshevism or communism or any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they understand peace,</v>

345
00:23:41.591 --> 00:23:45.620
<v Speaker 1>bread and land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On July first,</v>

346
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:51.190
<v Speaker 4>the Curran ski offensive visits </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes called with the July </v>

347
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:54.671
<v Speaker 4>offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>led by the great Russian general Brazil </v>

348
00:23:54.671 --> 00:23:57.700
<v Speaker 4>of launches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an attack on a wide front against the </v>

349
00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:01.211
<v Speaker 4>Germans and the Austra Hungarians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It becomes a disaster.</v>

350
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.180
<v Speaker 4>This is the way historian Peter Harte </v>
<v Speaker 4>describes it,</v>

351
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.560
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after a two day bombardment,</v>

352
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:11.710
<v Speaker 4>the second bruce,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a love offensive attack began with a </v>

353
00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:13.410
<v Speaker 4>flourish with the attack of the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 4>seventh and 11th armies on the southwest</v>

354
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:18.520
<v Speaker 4>front.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the infantry went over the top on </v>

355
00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:18.560
<v Speaker 4>first July,</v>
<v Speaker 4>early results were promising,</v>

356
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:23.830
<v Speaker 4>but then everything started to go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The best and most loyal units had been </v>

357
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:27.761
<v Speaker 4>chosen as the assault troops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>While the follow up and reserve </v>

358
00:24:27.761 --> 00:24:28.850
<v Speaker 4>formations were far less committed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>indeed,</v>

359
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.660
<v Speaker 4>when it came to moving forwards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many regimens simply refused.</v>

360
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:37.930
<v Speaker 4>The attack petered out in ignominy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>further plan to were either canceled or </v>

361
00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:40.660
<v Speaker 4>abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then a vigorous austro-hungarian counter</v>

362
00:24:40.661 --> 00:24:43.610
<v Speaker 4>offensive was launched at Ternopil in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Galicia.</v>

363
00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:48.610
<v Speaker 4>On Nineteenth July,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Russians broke and retreated in </v>

364
00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:52.001
<v Speaker 4>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This disaster triggered the replacement </v>

365
00:24:52.001 --> 00:24:53.300
<v Speaker 4>of brucellosis commander in chief by </v>
<v Speaker 4>General Cornell Law.</v>

366
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:58.330
<v Speaker 4>On the first of August,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Russian army was falling apart and </v>

367
00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:02.111
<v Speaker 4>such attacks as had been carried out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only serve to call the few remaining </v>

368
00:25:02.111 --> 00:25:06.191
<v Speaker 4>loyalist units,</v>
<v Speaker 4>still willing to actively prosecute the </v>

369
00:25:06.191 --> 00:25:09.131
<v Speaker 4>war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The vast majority of Russian soldiers </v>

370
00:25:09.131 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 4>were now content to be passive </v>
<v Speaker 4>observers.</v>

371
00:25:09.321 --> 00:25:13.850
<v Speaker 4>At best indeed by the autumn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was estimated that some 2 million had</v>

372
00:25:13.851 --> 00:25:18.851
<v Speaker 4>deserted and quote for a while the </v>
<v Speaker 4>German high command in the </v>

373
00:25:19.341 --> 00:25:24.341
<v Speaker 4>Austro-hungarian high commanding courage</v>
<v Speaker 4>their troops to fraternize with Russian </v>

374
00:25:24.341 --> 00:25:26.780
<v Speaker 4>troops to sort of undermine their </v>
<v Speaker 4>willingness to fight.</v>

375
00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:32.080
<v Speaker 4>They stopped doing that when they found </v>
<v Speaker 4>out that the Russian troops were </v>

376
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.711
<v Speaker 4>spreading socialist and Bolshevik </v>
<v Speaker 4>propaganda back to the German and </v>

377
00:25:35.711 --> 00:25:37.730
<v Speaker 4>Austro-hungarian troops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nonetheless,</v>

378
00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:43.060
<v Speaker 4>what that disaster at the current ski </v>
<v Speaker 4>offensive did was essentially proved </v>

379
00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:48.641
<v Speaker 4>that Russia's army was done and opened </v>
<v Speaker 4>the door even more to the Bolshevik </v>

380
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:56.230
<v Speaker 4>message calling for peace writer Gj </v>
<v Speaker 4>Meyer describes a letter from Rudolf </v>

381
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.620
<v Speaker 4>Hess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who in the next World War will be one of</v>

382
00:26:03.621 --> 00:26:08.621
<v Speaker 4>Hitler's henchmen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>writing back to his parents about what </v>

383
00:26:08.621 --> 00:26:11.000
<v Speaker 4>the Russians are doing opposite the </v>
<v Speaker 4>German lines.</v>

384
00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:14.180
<v Speaker 4>They're basically fighting amongst </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

385
00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.360
<v Speaker 4>He writes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote yesterday,</v>

386
00:26:17.361 --> 00:26:21.200
<v Speaker 4>we saw heavy fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but only among the Russians themselves.</v>

387
00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.930
<v Speaker 4>A Russian officer came over and gave </v>
<v Speaker 4>himself up.</v>

388
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:27.140
<v Speaker 4>He spoke perfect German.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was born in bodden,</v>

389
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:32.230
<v Speaker 4>but he's a Russian citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He told us that whole battles are going </v>

390
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:35.831
<v Speaker 4>on behind their lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their officers are shooting each other </v>

391
00:26:35.831 --> 00:26:38.090
<v Speaker 4>and the soldiers are doing the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He founded all too ridiculous.</v>

392
00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:40.790
<v Speaker 4>They can all get lost as far as he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>concerned.</v>

393
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.070
<v Speaker 4>We invited him to eat with us and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>thanked us.</v>

394
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 4>He ate well</v>

395
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.380
<v Speaker 1>and drank plenty of tea before going </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

396
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.840
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of noise coming from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian side.</v>

397
00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:53.841
<v Speaker 1>Yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were fighting each other in the </v>

398
00:26:53.841 --> 00:26:56.121
<v Speaker 1>trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also heard shots coming from their </v>

399
00:26:56.121 --> 00:26:56.190
<v Speaker 1>infantry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were firing at each other,</v>

400
00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:01.430
<v Speaker 1>charming and cooled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lenin said that the Russian soldiers </v>

401
00:27:03.631 --> 00:27:08.631
<v Speaker 1>were voting for peace with their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The failure of the July offensive was </v>

402
00:27:09.601 --> 00:27:14.601
<v Speaker 1>another nail in the coffin for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>provisional government and added to the </v>

403
00:27:14.601 --> 00:27:18.651
<v Speaker 1>support of Lenin and the Bolsheviks who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were able to portray themselves as the </v>

404
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.270
<v Speaker 1>real alternative to the provisional </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

405
00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:24.750
<v Speaker 1>the one party that didn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and what was going on,</v>

406
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.180
<v Speaker 1>and the more Russians didn't like what </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going on.</v>

407
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.510
<v Speaker 1>The more the only choice to change that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to be the bolsheviks.</v>

408
00:27:30.511 --> 00:27:35.511
<v Speaker 1>And over the months between the February</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution that toppled the czar and </v>

409
00:27:35.511 --> 00:27:40.041
<v Speaker 1>just about November,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bolsheviks increased their support </v>

410
00:27:40.041 --> 00:27:44.510
<v Speaker 1>in these councils of peasants and </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers and workers known as the </v>

411
00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Soviets.</v>

412
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.990
<v Speaker 1>And on November seventh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

413
00:27:45.991 --> 00:27:50.991
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they moved in a triumph of superior </v>

414
00:27:51.421 --> 00:27:56.421
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were able to take over the most </v>

415
00:27:56.421 --> 00:28:00.051
<v Speaker 1>important government buildings in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian capital in a coup that most </v>

416
00:28:00.421 --> 00:28:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Russians awoke to find a fait accompli </v>
<v Speaker 1>already finished.</v>

417
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:10.250
<v Speaker 1>And the most radical government in power</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a major state since the French </v>

418
00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:14.490
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden,</v>

419
00:28:14.491 --> 00:28:19.491
<v Speaker 1>Lenin and the Bolsheviks were in charge </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Russia and marks and the other 19th </v>

420
00:28:22.831 --> 00:28:27.831
<v Speaker 1>century thinkers we're about to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ideas updated,</v>

421
00:28:28.021 --> 00:28:29.160
<v Speaker 1>evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morphed,</v>

422
00:28:29.161 --> 00:28:34.161
<v Speaker 1>and changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put into practice in what was about to </v>

423
00:28:34.161 --> 00:28:37.671
<v Speaker 1>become a giant human experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to most of old Europe,</v>

424
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:43.520
<v Speaker 1>this looked like a human experiment </v>
<v Speaker 1>conducted by a mad scientist to them.</v>

425
00:28:43.801 --> 00:28:48.801
<v Speaker 1>It looked like the second coming of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French revolution and Lenin and the </v>

426
00:28:48.801 --> 00:28:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Bolsheviks might as well have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>jacobins.</v>

427
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:56.120
<v Speaker 1>How long before the guillotines are </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought out and everyone starts getting </v>

428
00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:56.120
<v Speaker 1>their head chopped off.</v>

429
00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:02.390
<v Speaker 1>Within 24 or so hours of taking power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lennon starts to make good on some of </v>

430
00:29:02.851 --> 00:29:07.851
<v Speaker 1>his promises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Understand though Lennon's promises had </v>

431
00:29:07.851 --> 00:29:11.181
<v Speaker 1>a tactical purpose in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would end up in his mind helping to</v>

432
00:29:11.311 --> 00:29:14.520
<v Speaker 1>spread the revolution to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

433
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:20.300
<v Speaker 1>The fire caused by German General Ludin </v>
<v Speaker 1>doors attempt to burn down his </v>

434
00:29:20.881 --> 00:29:25.881
<v Speaker 1>neighbor's apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're beginning to fan the flames to a </v>

435
00:29:25.881 --> 00:29:29.991
<v Speaker 1>degree where many other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're likely to get burned Lennon's </v>

436
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:33.030
<v Speaker 1>decree on land set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Among other things,</v>

437
00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:38.300
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>private ownership of land shall be </v>

438
00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.001
<v Speaker 1>abolished forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All land shall become the property of </v>

439
00:29:41.001 --> 00:29:44.691
<v Speaker 1>the whole people and into the use of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who cultivated and cooled.</v>

440
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Then Lennon started spreading the sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of propaganda that most horrified the </v>

441
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.640
<v Speaker 1>powers who had been fighting the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>world war for more than three years.</v>

442
00:29:54.641 --> 00:29:55.720
<v Speaker 1>By this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

443
00:29:55.721 --> 00:30:00.721
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shall offer piece for the peoples of </v>

444
00:30:00.721 --> 00:30:03.040
<v Speaker 1>all the belligerent countries upon the </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis of the Soviet terms,</v>

445
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.890
<v Speaker 1>no annexations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no indemnities,</v>

446
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.650
<v Speaker 1>and the right of self determination of </v>
<v Speaker 1>peoples.</v>

447
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.290
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to our promise,</v>

448
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:16.440
<v Speaker 1>we shall publish and repudiate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>secret treaties and quote the secret </v>

449
00:30:17.051 --> 00:30:22.051
<v Speaker 1>treaties were the treaties amongst the </v>
<v Speaker 1>allied powers that were in the files of </v>

450
00:30:22.661 --> 00:30:27.661
<v Speaker 1>the winter palace and the Bolsheviks had</v>
<v Speaker 1>just taken over by making what was in </v>

451
00:30:29.051 --> 00:30:34.051
<v Speaker 1>those files public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Bolsheviks were pulling the </v>

452
00:30:34.051 --> 00:30:37.990
<v Speaker 1>wikileaks maneuver or the Edward Snowden</v>
<v Speaker 1>disclosure of their day.</v>

453
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:42.580
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another similarity to the release of the</v>

454
00:30:42.581 --> 00:30:45.760
<v Speaker 1>secret treaties and the Wiki leaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edward Snowden,</v>

455
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:50.920
<v Speaker 1>revelations of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the more modern era are the newspaper</v>

456
00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:53.680
<v Speaker 1>in Britain that released the information</v>
<v Speaker 1>to British readers.</v>

457
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:58.090
<v Speaker 1>It was the Manchester Guardian that </v>
<v Speaker 1>published in Britain.</v>

458
00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:02.590
<v Speaker 1>The secret treaty information that Leon </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trotsky,</v>

459
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:04.330
<v Speaker 1>the Bolsheviks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>released to the world,</v>

460
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.780
<v Speaker 1>that's the same newspaper in Britain </v>
<v Speaker 1>that took the lead almost 100 years </v>

461
00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:13.981
<v Speaker 1>later in revealing the Edward snowden </v>
<v Speaker 1>revelations as historians Michael Nyberg</v>

462
00:31:15.461 --> 00:31:20.461
<v Speaker 1>and David Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in their history of the eastern </v>

463
00:31:20.461 --> 00:31:23.221
<v Speaker 1>front in the first world war quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bolshevik leaders had little </v>

464
00:31:23.221 --> 00:31:25.480
<v Speaker 1>interest in working with the capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>Western allies.</v>

465
00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:30.810
<v Speaker 1>They soon publish the text of the secret</v>
<v Speaker 1>treaties and diplomatic understandings </v>

466
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:33.610
<v Speaker 1>that they found in the winter palace and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government archives.</v>

467
00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:38.940
<v Speaker 1>These agreements showed French and </v>
<v Speaker 1>British support for Russian territorial </v>

468
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:42.961
<v Speaker 1>gain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially at Turkey's expense with </v>

469
00:31:42.961 --> 00:31:45.481
<v Speaker 1>regard to Constantinople.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This seemingly revealed with the </v>

470
00:31:45.481 --> 00:31:48.781
<v Speaker 1>Bolsheviks had been arguing all along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely that the war had been fought for </v>

471
00:31:48.781 --> 00:31:50.830
<v Speaker 1>imperial interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not out of self defense.</v>

472
00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:56.160
<v Speaker 1>The publication of these terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed ally diplomats who had </v>

473
00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.220
<v Speaker 1>claimed in public that no such </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreements existed.</v>

474
00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:02.580
<v Speaker 1>This also anchored the Americans who had</v>
<v Speaker 1>advocated a piece without annexations </v>

475
00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:07.170
<v Speaker 1>and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new Bolshevik government began to </v>

476
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:12.780
<v Speaker 1>tell generals along the entire front </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Germans and Hungarians and </v>

477
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Turks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they should start making local </v>

478
00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:17.860
<v Speaker 1>peace treaties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They called for an armistice for 30 days</v>

479
00:32:17.861 --> 00:32:20.470
<v Speaker 1>along the entire front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden,</v>

480
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Russia was in the process of dropping </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the war.</v>

481
00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Lenin is supposed to have said a famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote that aptly describes the situation</v>

482
00:32:30.701 --> 00:32:32.200
<v Speaker 1>in November 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17.</v>

483
00:32:32.201 --> 00:32:32.830
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

484
00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:38.220
<v Speaker 1>there are decades when nothing happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are weeks when decades happen </v>

485
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 1>and quote and</v>

486
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.070
<v Speaker 4>look at the change in fortune for him </v>
<v Speaker 4>personally.</v>

487
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:49.030
<v Speaker 4>Six or seven months ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's living in a rented flat on the </v>

488
00:32:49.041 --> 00:32:52.820
<v Speaker 4>second floor next to a sausage factory </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Switzerland.</v>

489
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:55.670
<v Speaker 4>Now by November 19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>17,</v>

490
00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:59.990
<v Speaker 4>he's basically the guy in charge of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>largest nation on earth,</v>

491
00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:05.860
<v Speaker 4>but this leadership is not uncontested.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A Russian civil war starts almost </v>

492
00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:10.391
<v Speaker 4>immediately with the people who opposed </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lenin and the Bolsheviks and it will go </v>

493
00:33:10.391 --> 00:33:14.681
<v Speaker 4>on for several years and be terribly </v>
<v Speaker 4>bloody and drawing the great powers as </v>

494
00:33:14.681 --> 00:33:17.090
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It also will not include $50,</v>

495
00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:21.980
<v Speaker 4>million or more people who are counted </v>
<v Speaker 4>as the citizens of old Russia as some of</v>

496
00:33:21.981 --> 00:33:24.980
<v Speaker 4>these territories begin to break away </v>
<v Speaker 4>from Russia.</v>

497
00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:30.550
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the really dangerous things that </v>

498
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:32.880
<v Speaker 4>the new Bolshevik government professes </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a belief in self determination.</v>

499
00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:38.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are lots of different peoples who </v>

500
00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:38.560
<v Speaker 4>didn't want to be a part of the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 4>government,</v>

501
00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.100
<v Speaker 4>perhaps the fins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Poles,</v>

502
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:45.400
<v Speaker 4>the Ukrainians and others who were </v>
<v Speaker 4>starting to think maybe they would just </v>

503
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:45.400
<v Speaker 4>leave.</v>

504
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:51.100
<v Speaker 4>They were far from the only peoples who </v>
<v Speaker 4>were members of larger state entities </v>

505
00:33:51.531 --> 00:33:56.420
<v Speaker 4>around the world who thought that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>would like a crack itself determination.</v>

506
00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.200
<v Speaker 4>All these European countries that had </v>
<v Speaker 4>colonies were in the same position and </v>

507
00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:07.091
<v Speaker 4>there was no message more dangerous than</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that the time had come to </v>

508
00:34:07.091 --> 00:34:11.441
<v Speaker 4>perhaps allow all these people to decide</v>
<v Speaker 4>for themselves whether they wanted to </v>

509
00:34:11.441 --> 00:34:15.971
<v Speaker 4>stay colonies already the plague </v>
<v Speaker 4>bacillus begins to spread and </v>

510
00:34:16.701 --> 00:34:21.701
<v Speaker 4>threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just the allies and the entente </v>

511
00:34:21.701 --> 00:34:24.581
<v Speaker 4>powers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but soon the powers that made it </v>

512
00:34:24.581 --> 00:34:26.870
<v Speaker 4>possible for Lenin to get back and start</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fire in Russia to begin with.</v>

513
00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:33.130
<v Speaker 4>This is the point in the story where </v>
<v Speaker 4>Russia and communism veer off into their</v>

514
00:34:35.571 --> 00:34:37.730
<v Speaker 4>own tail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a very long,</v>

515
00:34:37.731 --> 00:34:41.510
<v Speaker 4>complex tale that impacts the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the 20th century.</v>

516
00:34:41.511 --> 00:34:46.511
<v Speaker 4>You can easily make the case that </v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps the most important longterm </v>

517
00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.590
<v Speaker 4>effect of the first world war is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>collapse of the Russian czar,</v>

518
00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.770
<v Speaker 4>an eventual replacement by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bolsheviks.</v>

519
00:34:55.670 --> 00:35:00.670
<v Speaker 4>It will eventually lead to Joseph Stalin</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the horrors of the Gulag and the </v>

520
00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:07.420
<v Speaker 4>Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a wonderfully prophetic line </v>

521
00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.600
<v Speaker 4>around the time of Karl Marx,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you can see how long before this time</v>

522
00:35:11.601 --> 00:35:15.440
<v Speaker 4>period that revolutionary thinkers like </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bakunin,</v>

523
00:35:15.441 --> 00:35:20.441
<v Speaker 4>we're saying quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you took the most ardent </v>

524
00:35:20.441 --> 00:35:22.040
<v Speaker 4>revolutionary vested him in absolute </v>
<v Speaker 4>power,</v>

525
00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:27.160
<v Speaker 4>within a year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would be worse than the tsar himself </v>

526
00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.180
<v Speaker 4>and quote and for all his high minded </v>
<v Speaker 4>rhetoric,</v>

527
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:34.600
<v Speaker 4>very quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vladimir Lenin was proving Bakunin </v>

528
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:37.230
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in late 19,</v>

529
00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 4>17,</v>
<v Speaker 4>early</v>

530
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:43.040
<v Speaker 1>1918,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that side of the Bolsheviks and the </v>

531
00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:46.671
<v Speaker 1>communist regime in Russia was still </v>
<v Speaker 1>debatable and unknown.</v>

532
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.010
<v Speaker 1>If you actually read their public </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouncements,</v>

533
00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.310
<v Speaker 1>they look like an almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

534
00:35:52.311 --> 00:35:53.040
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

535
00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.570
<v Speaker 1>in hindsight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sounds terrible,</v>

536
00:35:54.571 --> 00:35:59.571
<v Speaker 1>but almost a refreshing group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>idealists who refuse to play by the old </v>

537
00:36:00.211 --> 00:36:01.740
<v Speaker 1>cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard bitten,</v>

538
00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:04.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules of the European powers.</v>

539
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:10.430
<v Speaker 1>And to get an idea of how difficult it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to figure out what's going on there </v>

540
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:14.841
<v Speaker 1>and what these people are like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can look at diaries written during </v>

541
00:36:14.841 --> 00:36:17.340
<v Speaker 1>the time period where people try to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of what they're seeing in Russia.</v>

542
00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Take for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evelyn,</v>

543
00:36:18.781 --> 00:36:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Princess Blue Cheer and we've talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about her before.</v>

544
00:36:21.301 --> 00:36:26.301
<v Speaker 1>She's an English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wife of a German nobleman living in </v>

545
00:36:26.301 --> 00:36:30.201
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she kept a diary that's often </v>

546
00:36:30.201 --> 00:36:31.680
<v Speaker 1>referred to to give sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>impression of what's going on in Germany</v>

547
00:36:31.681 --> 00:36:32.510
<v Speaker 1>and the feelings that they have.</v>

548
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.920
<v Speaker 1>And she writes about this new government</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Russia.</v>

549
00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:39.360
<v Speaker 1>While the peace negotiations to end the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war in the east are going on,</v>

550
00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:44.930
<v Speaker 1>those negotiations will end up with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the most one sided treaties and all </v>

551
00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:45.280
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called [inaudible].</v>

552
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:50.870
<v Speaker 1>And the only reason it's so one sided is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the bolsheviks were in such danger </v>

553
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:53.070
<v Speaker 1>of getting overthrown before they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>consolidated power.</v>

554
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.670
<v Speaker 1>That eventually they just agree to one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the worst deals of all time.</v>

555
00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.940
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that the communist revolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>is soon going to come and sweep all </v>

556
00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:03.960
<v Speaker 1>these western European governments and </v>
<v Speaker 1>central European governments away.</v>

557
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so who cares what they agree to during </v>

558
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:11.910
<v Speaker 1>the negotiations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leon Trotsky and a man we've also quoted</v>

559
00:37:11.911 --> 00:37:14.310
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a key figure in the Bolshevik government</v>

560
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:18.090
<v Speaker 1>is negotiating this deal and blue shirt </v>
<v Speaker 1>writes in her diary.</v>

561
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:23.150
<v Speaker 1>In January in 1918,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the breast litoff's negotiation seemed </v>

562
00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:28.491
<v Speaker 1>likely to come to nothing as Trotsky </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be playing a double part and </v>

563
00:37:28.491 --> 00:37:32.991
<v Speaker 1>people say he's only toying with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>central powers to be better able to sow </v>

564
00:37:32.991 --> 00:37:36.120
<v Speaker 1>the seeds of sedition and rebellion </v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst the West European peoples.</v>

565
00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:41.420
<v Speaker 1>They say that already the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>prisoners had been set free in Russia </v>

566
00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:45.080
<v Speaker 1>and that common soldiers are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>placed in command over their former </v>

567
00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:45.750
<v Speaker 1>officers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She continues quote,</v>

568
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:48.660
<v Speaker 1>there are many different opinions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trotsky here,</v>

569
00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:53.790
<v Speaker 1>some calling him a dreamer and idealist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>others abusing him as a blood thirsty.</v>

570
00:37:53.791 --> 00:37:58.791
<v Speaker 1>Tyrant wills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a whole class of admirers who </v>

571
00:37:58.791 --> 00:38:01.761
<v Speaker 1>declare him to be the greatest man since</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ lived upon the earth and the </v>

572
00:38:01.761 --> 00:38:05.721
<v Speaker 1>profit of a new religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to regenerate mankind and </v>

573
00:38:05.721 --> 00:38:07.740
<v Speaker 1>create a new paradise after the delusion</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the war.</v>

574
00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what part this man may be </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to play in the future fates of </v>

575
00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:16.491
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some 120 years ago people were saying </v>

576
00:38:16.491 --> 00:38:19.281
<v Speaker 1>almost the same things have a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown little officer who out of the </v>

577
00:38:19.281 --> 00:38:23.511
<v Speaker 1>reign of terror and bloodshed developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the vampire emperor who almost </v>

578
00:38:23.511 --> 00:38:26.980
<v Speaker 1>succeeded in draining the blood of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe and quote.</v>

579
00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:28.740
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

580
00:38:28.741 --> 00:38:33.741
<v Speaker 1>is referencing Napoleon who grew out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the French revolution to people at the </v>

581
00:38:33.741 --> 00:38:38.301
<v Speaker 1>time period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the revolution in Russia </v>

582
00:38:38.301 --> 00:38:40.060
<v Speaker 1>kind of resembled and there are quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few similarities that are pointed out by</v>

583
00:38:40.061 --> 00:38:45.061
<v Speaker 1>various historians between the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>Revolution and the Napoleonic era and </v>

584
00:38:45.061 --> 00:38:46.810
<v Speaker 1>the era when the bolsheviks take charge </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Russia.</v>

585
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:52.020
<v Speaker 1>Take for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the stipulations that the </v>

586
00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Bolsheviks were making during the peace </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiations at Bressler task.</v>

587
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:59.100
<v Speaker 1>They wanted their troops to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right during the negotiations to </v>

588
00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:03.031
<v Speaker 1>fraternize with the German and Austrian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian soldiers on the other side of </v>

589
00:39:03.031 --> 00:39:04.780
<v Speaker 1>no man's land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did they want that?</v>

590
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Because they felt that just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon's troops spreading the ideas,</v>

591
00:39:09.521 --> 00:39:13.390
<v Speaker 1>the intellectual contagion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sedition of the French revolutionary</v>

592
00:39:13.391 --> 00:39:18.391
<v Speaker 1>ideas to the lands of the kings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Czars and emperors in,</v>

593
00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:21.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18th and early 19th century Europe,</v>

594
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:26.430
<v Speaker 1>the Bolsheviks assumed that their troops</v>
<v Speaker 1>would do the same thing to the Germans </v>

595
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:30.211
<v Speaker 1>and the ostrow Hungarians in early 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century Europe combined that with the </v>

596
00:39:30.221 --> 00:39:35.221
<v Speaker 1>impact that the release of the secret </v>
<v Speaker 1>treaty agreements was having and the </v>

597
00:39:35.221 --> 00:39:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Russian government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new Russian government,</v>

598
00:39:36.641 --> 00:39:38.500
<v Speaker 1>the idealistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least on the surface,</v>

599
00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:43.501
<v Speaker 1>new Russian government was doing amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>damage to the allied war effort by </v>

600
00:39:43.601 --> 00:39:46.930
<v Speaker 1>undercutting all the propaganda and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a help.</v>

601
00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:51.930
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other really idealistic power that </v>

602
00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:54.070
<v Speaker 1>was starting to have an impact on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world scene was across the Atlantic.</v>

603
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:57.190
<v Speaker 1>It was the United States and to the hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitten,</v>

604
00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:01.960
<v Speaker 1>cynical Bismarckian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real politic Europe of that day.</v>

605
00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:05.950
<v Speaker 1>It would have been hard for them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide who was more idealistic.</v>

606
00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:11.340
<v Speaker 1>The new Russian Bolshevik government or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the American government of Woodrow </v>

607
00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Wilson.</v>

608
00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:16.720
<v Speaker 1>In a sense though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to blame,</v>

609
00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:22.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain and France and these other </v>

610
00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:23.971
<v Speaker 1>European powers for the fact that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had gone into the war making agreements </v>

611
00:40:24.161 --> 00:40:29.161
<v Speaker 1>with each other and their allies for </v>
<v Speaker 1>carving up this territory or exchanging </v>

612
00:40:29.161 --> 00:40:33.991
<v Speaker 1>that territory because that was standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>operating procedure when the war started</v>

613
00:40:34.241 --> 00:40:35.360
<v Speaker 1>and had been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

614
00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:40.380
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 19th century is full of those kinds </v>

615
00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.811
<v Speaker 1>of conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is in just a couple of </v>

616
00:40:42.811 --> 00:40:44.200
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things have changed in so many ways.</v>

617
00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:49.560
<v Speaker 1>The first world war is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>transitionary period from the 19th to </v>

618
00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:53.221
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century and that includes </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like the proper and moral </v>

619
00:40:54.311 --> 00:40:59.311
<v Speaker 1>justifications for war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm part of the problem is that for </v>

620
00:40:59.311 --> 00:41:01.210
<v Speaker 1>three years now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the allies,</v>

621
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:06.600
<v Speaker 1>to name just one example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the central powers were doing similar </v>

622
00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:09.361
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had made the war aims out to be these </v>

623
00:41:09.361 --> 00:41:10.030
<v Speaker 1>high minded ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

624
00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:15.330
<v Speaker 1>The war to end all wars or making the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world safe for democracy or fighting,</v>

625
00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:17.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>German militarism.</v>

626
00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were all these very high </v>
<v Speaker 1>minded ideals.</v>

627
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:24.990
<v Speaker 1>So when you sell people on those ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they find out that really what </v>

628
00:41:25.031 --> 00:41:28.150
<v Speaker 1>those soldiers are dying for is much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more pedestrian,</v>

629
00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:29.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorts of ames,</v>

630
00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:35.450
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to square those two realities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

631
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:40.660
<v Speaker 1>there were nations involved in the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>world war that essentially had joined </v>

632
00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:41.330
<v Speaker 1>sides with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

633
00:41:41.331 --> 00:41:44.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alliance that promised them the best</v>

634
00:41:44.121 --> 00:41:45.620
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italy,</v>

635
00:41:45.621 --> 00:41:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Bulgaria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Romania,</v>

636
00:41:47.031 --> 00:41:50.870
<v Speaker 1>to name just three countries got into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this war for no other reason than,</v>

637
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:52.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one side or the other,</v>

638
00:41:52.461 --> 00:41:57.461
<v Speaker 1>promise them some territorial gain that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was more than the other side promised </v>

639
00:41:57.461 --> 00:42:01.651
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a very common reality from the </v>

640
00:42:01.651 --> 00:42:04.331
<v Speaker 1>19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of what changed that and made it </v>

641
00:42:04.331 --> 00:42:09.130
<v Speaker 1>unacceptable was the price that Europe </v>
<v Speaker 1>was being forced to pay for these </v>

642
00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:11.270
<v Speaker 1>territorial acquisitions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

643
00:42:11.271 --> 00:42:16.271
<v Speaker 1>a perfect example is 20 years before </v>
<v Speaker 1>this time period where we are now </v>

644
00:42:16.271 --> 00:42:16.271
<v Speaker 1>instead of 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>

645
00:42:16.271 --> 00:42:17.150
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late 1917.</v>

646
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you're in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>98 and you're the British army in an </v>

647
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:23.990
<v Speaker 1>area that's going to become part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

648
00:42:23.991 --> 00:42:28.991
<v Speaker 1>your colonial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the territories that you have direct or </v>

649
00:42:28.991 --> 00:42:29.810
<v Speaker 1>indirect control over in the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation of Sudan.</v>

650
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:34.010
<v Speaker 1>There was a very big battle called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Omdurman fought in 18,</v>

651
00:42:34.011 --> 00:42:39.011
<v Speaker 1>98.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Winston Churchill was there as a very </v>

652
00:42:39.011 --> 00:42:39.011
<v Speaker 1>young man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His first real exposure to violence,</v>

653
00:42:39.011 --> 00:42:40.460
<v Speaker 1>I think he killed a couple of people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that battle,</v>

654
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:45.080
<v Speaker 1>honor Omdurman had about 8,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>or so British troops and then they had a</v>

655
00:42:45.081 --> 00:42:47.810
<v Speaker 1>bunch of allies of theirs from Egypt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>places like that.</v>

656
00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Natives is not the right word because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think of like tribesmen but,</v>

657
00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:57.760
<v Speaker 1>but but troops from Egypt and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting people who were kind of </v>

658
00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:02.090
<v Speaker 1>tribesmen a bunch of Sudanese under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a leader in that country,</v>

659
00:43:02.091 --> 00:43:07.091
<v Speaker 1>more than 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them show up to this battle against </v>

660
00:43:07.091 --> 00:43:10.331
<v Speaker 1>this small group of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of British and British allies and using </v>

661
00:43:11.511 --> 00:43:14.900
<v Speaker 1>modern weaponry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including basically machine guns,</v>

662
00:43:14.901 --> 00:43:19.901
<v Speaker 1>modern rifles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's essentially in a Beta </v>

663
00:43:19.901 --> 00:43:22.391
<v Speaker 1>version of the first world war army that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain goes to war with and they're </v>

664
00:43:22.391 --> 00:43:25.961
<v Speaker 1>fighting guys who have muskets </v>
<v Speaker 1>practically and in one afternoon they </v>

665
00:43:27.461 --> 00:43:32.461
<v Speaker 1>inflict some 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>or more casual to use on the tribesmen </v>

666
00:43:32.461 --> 00:43:34.060
<v Speaker 1>and folks that they're facing.</v>

667
00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:36.500
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>

668
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:41.630
<v Speaker 1>5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>captured the rest wounded and the </v>

669
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:44.091
<v Speaker 1>British lose 45 to 50 British soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the endeavor,</v>

670
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:49.910
<v Speaker 1>45 to 50 and they just demolished this </v>
<v Speaker 1>native force when you're only losing </v>

671
00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:55.530
<v Speaker 1>that number of people for such great </v>
<v Speaker 1>gains.</v>

672
00:43:57.210 --> 00:44:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you don't always think too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much about the deeper questions involved</v>

673
00:44:02.311 --> 00:44:05.760
<v Speaker 1>in the cost because the cost isn't that </v>
<v Speaker 1>great and let's be honest,</v>

674
00:44:05.761 --> 00:44:10.761
<v Speaker 1>in this era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if those British soldiers had been </v>

675
00:44:10.761 --> 00:44:14.211
<v Speaker 1>wiping out Frenchman or Germans or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Swedes are people like themselves,</v>

676
00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:20.090
<v Speaker 1>there might've been more of an outrage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an era where sometimes the </v>

677
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:25.071
<v Speaker 1>killing of native peoples in other </v>
<v Speaker 1>places was not given the same sort of a </v>

678
00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:31.090
<v Speaker 1>sense of horror and outrage that killing</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who looked like yourself might</v>

679
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.440
<v Speaker 4>engender.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all understand how that might work.</v>

680
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:41.480
<v Speaker 4>And so instead of a battle of Omdurman </v>
<v Speaker 4>where the changing of territory was it </v>

681
00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:45.090
<v Speaker 4>relatively small affair with relatively </v>
<v Speaker 4>few casualties.</v>

682
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:46.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in late 1917,</v>

683
00:44:46.921 --> 00:44:49.740
<v Speaker 4>the Germans and the British in just one </v>
<v Speaker 4>battle in this war,</v>

684
00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:53.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>suffer between 200 and 500,000</v>

685
00:44:53.041 --> 00:44:57.620
<v Speaker 4>casualties each.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think of deeper,</v>

686
00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:02.890
<v Speaker 4>different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more fundamental questions when you not </v>

687
00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:06.251
<v Speaker 4>only suffer casualties like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you do so over and over and over </v>

688
00:45:06.251 --> 00:45:09.410
<v Speaker 4>again with no appreciable change,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing,</v>

689
00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:12.920
<v Speaker 4>certainly worth all that and you begin </v>
<v Speaker 4>asking fundamental questions about these</v>

690
00:45:12.921 --> 00:45:15.920
<v Speaker 4>treaties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You wrote an earlier time in this war,</v>

691
00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:21.400
<v Speaker 4>how many Frenchman is it worth losing to</v>
<v Speaker 4>regain the lost territories of Alsace </v>

692
00:45:21.681 --> 00:45:26.180
<v Speaker 4>and Lorraine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many German young people is it worth</v>

693
00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:31.720
<v Speaker 4>to hold onto Belgium?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many Austro-hungarian troops or </v>

694
00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:36.651
<v Speaker 4>conversely Italian troops you know is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that particular area near [inaudible] </v>

695
00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:42.860
<v Speaker 4>worth?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many diminutive lives in Indian </v>

696
00:45:43.231 --> 00:45:48.231
<v Speaker 4>lives in British lives?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is postwar British involvement in the </v>

697
00:45:48.231 --> 00:45:50.280
<v Speaker 4>Middle East worth?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

698
00:45:50.281 --> 00:45:52.830
<v Speaker 4>if it's the battle of Omdurman and we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking tiny numbers,</v>

699
00:45:52.831 --> 00:45:57.831
<v Speaker 4>it's certainly worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a number that you're going to </v>

700
00:45:57.831 --> 00:45:57.840
<v Speaker 4>get to when it's not</v>

701
00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:05.170
<v Speaker 4>and the first world war challenges a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of people to ask those kinds of </v>

702
00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:08.201
<v Speaker 4>questions and the people that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>operating under the same sort of </v>

703
00:46:08.201 --> 00:46:10.730
<v Speaker 4>mentality that would have been present </v>
<v Speaker 4>at a battle of Omdurman are red faced.</v>

704
00:46:10.731 --> 00:46:15.731
<v Speaker 4>When these treaties show up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>showing that that's just what they're </v>

705
00:46:15.731 --> 00:46:18.281
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They haven't changed yet and the </v>

706
00:46:18.281 --> 00:46:18.281
<v Speaker 4>treaties are going to have to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>fulfilled anyway.</v>

707
00:46:18.281 --> 00:46:23.200
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you didn't feel bad enough in late </v>

708
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.871
<v Speaker 4>1917 when the bolsheviks released this </v>
<v Speaker 4>information in January of 1918 in part </v>

709
00:46:26.391 --> 00:46:28.850
<v Speaker 4>because the bolsheviks did release this </v>
<v Speaker 4>information,</v>

710
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:34.270
<v Speaker 4>President Woodrow Wilson in the United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States released something called the 14 </v>

711
00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:37.010
<v Speaker 4>points.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the 14 points,</v>

712
00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:42.300
<v Speaker 4>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the Bolshevik move that makes the </v>

713
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:42.600
<v Speaker 4>rest of the world looked like a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>capitalists,</v>

714
00:46:42.601 --> 00:46:47.601
<v Speaker 4>warmongers is like a left hook.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The American move in 1918 in January.</v>

715
00:46:48.561 --> 00:46:52.760
<v Speaker 4>It's like a right cross right afterwards</v>
<v Speaker 4>to all these European old powers because</v>

716
00:46:52.761 --> 00:46:57.761
<v Speaker 4>the United States hitting from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the other side of the idealism </v>

717
00:46:57.761 --> 00:47:01.121
<v Speaker 4>scale are suggesting that you should </v>
<v Speaker 4>have a war based on things like mutual </v>

718
00:47:02.781 --> 00:47:03.620
<v Speaker 4>respect.</v>

719
00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:09.310
<v Speaker 4>Woodrow Wilson says Nice things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example about the Germans and how </v>

720
00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:12.280
<v Speaker 4>the Americans and the rest of the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>do not begrudge the Germans a shot at </v>

721
00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:12.830
<v Speaker 4>German greatness and all this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

722
00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:14.510
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>conciliatory stuff.</v>

723
00:47:14.511 --> 00:47:19.511
<v Speaker 4>If you're trying to have a deal and make</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody come to the table feeling </v>

724
00:47:19.511 --> 00:47:19.511
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

725
00:47:19.511 --> 00:47:23.201
<v Speaker 4>we can work together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're the French and you've </v>

726
00:47:23.201 --> 00:47:23.510
<v Speaker 4>already suffered more than a million </v>
<v Speaker 4>casualties against these people,</v>

727
00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:26.150
<v Speaker 4>you had a war against them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Regeneration in the past.</v>

728
00:47:26.151 --> 00:47:30.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're not really in the mood to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be very conciliatory and then Wilson</v>

729
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:35.400
<v Speaker 1>starts talking about stuff that's as </v>
<v Speaker 1>idealistic as anything the Bolsheviks </v>

730
00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.820
<v Speaker 1>are putting out and a lot of it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar.</v>

731
00:47:36.821 --> 00:47:41.821
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how Wilson leads into his 14 </v>

732
00:47:41.821 --> 00:47:45.451
<v Speaker 1>points and notice how often he talks </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a change in you know,</v>

733
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:50.910
<v Speaker 1>what we could maybe call today global </v>
<v Speaker 1>public opinion or international morality</v>

734
00:47:52.181 --> 00:47:57.181
<v Speaker 1>and values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says from the beginning of his </v>

735
00:47:57.181 --> 00:47:59.180
<v Speaker 1>statement that's gone down in history as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 14 points quote,</v>

736
00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:05.700
<v Speaker 1>it will be our wish and purpose that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>processes of peace when they are begun </v>

737
00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:10.890
<v Speaker 1>shall be absolutely open and they shall </v>
<v Speaker 1>involve and permit henceforth no secret </v>

738
00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:15.871
<v Speaker 1>understandings of any kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The day of conquest and aggrandizement </v>

739
00:48:15.871 --> 00:48:20.430
<v Speaker 1>is gone by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was also the day of secret </v>

740
00:48:20.430 --> 00:48:21.520
<v Speaker 1>covenance entered into in the interest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of particular governments.</v>

741
00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:25.780
<v Speaker 1>And likely at some unlooked for a moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>to upset the peace of the world.</v>

742
00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:31.100
<v Speaker 1>It is this happy fat now clear to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>view of every public man whose thoughts </v>

743
00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:33.520
<v Speaker 1>do not still linger in an age that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead and gone,</v>

744
00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:38.760
<v Speaker 1>which makes it possible for every nation</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose purposes are consistent with </v>

745
00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.840
<v Speaker 1>justice and the peace of the world to </v>
<v Speaker 1>avow,</v>

746
00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:43.960
<v Speaker 1>nor at any other time the objects it has</v>
<v Speaker 1>in view.</v>

747
00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:49.440
<v Speaker 1>And he then goes into you know the kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things he's talking about here that </v>

748
00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.360
<v Speaker 1>will make a difference in the postwar </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and that everybody should start to</v>

749
00:48:52.361 --> 00:48:54.160
<v Speaker 1>agree to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

750
00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:58.450
<v Speaker 1>as the number 1:14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one point in the 14 points,</v>

751
00:48:58.451 --> 00:49:03.451
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open covenance of peace openly arrived </v>

752
00:49:03.451 --> 00:49:07.591
<v Speaker 1>at after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which there shall be no private </v>

753
00:49:07.591 --> 00:49:07.591
<v Speaker 1>international understandings of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind,</v>

754
00:49:07.591 --> 00:49:10.720
<v Speaker 1>but diplomacy shall proceed always </v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>

755
00:49:10.721 --> 00:49:13.120
<v Speaker 1>and in the public view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to quote,</v>

756
00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:18.070
<v Speaker 1>can you imagine even the governments of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our world today?</v>

757
00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Even talking about doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that Jews had treaties with </v>

758
00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:27.000
<v Speaker 1>other countries and all the agreements </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be public and open to everyone.</v>

759
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:28.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's radical stuff.</v>

760
00:49:28.870 --> 00:49:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Even today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounded every bit like what the </v>

761
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Bolsheviks were calling for and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden you have all Europe.</v>

762
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.210
<v Speaker 1>The three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

763
00:49:37.211 --> 00:49:39.550
<v Speaker 1>five years ago was sitting at the height</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his fame.</v>

764
00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Everything was fine and now they've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>this on both sides of them from powerful</v>

765
00:49:44.681 --> 00:49:47.650
<v Speaker 1>nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real change in attitude.</v>

766
00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:52.890
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though it's not going to be allowed to </v>

767
00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:55.591
<v Speaker 1>change agreements that countries have </v>
<v Speaker 1>between each other and the juiciest </v>

768
00:49:55.601 --> 00:50:00.601
<v Speaker 1>stuff that came out of these secret </v>
<v Speaker 1>treaty released the the Edward Snowden </v>

769
00:50:00.601 --> 00:50:04.801
<v Speaker 1>like dumped to the Manchester Guardian </v>
<v Speaker 1>and others was the treaties that had </v>

770
00:50:04.801 --> 00:50:08.130
<v Speaker 1>been signed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them as late as 1916,</v>

771
00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.390
<v Speaker 1>the most famous is known as the Sikes </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pico agreement,</v>

772
00:50:10.391 --> 00:50:15.391
<v Speaker 1>but there are others that catalog the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great powers plan for ripping apart the </v>

773
00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Ottoman Empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the great powers on the allied side </v>

774
00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:24.511
<v Speaker 1>won the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were going to go totally imperial </v>

775
00:50:24.511 --> 00:50:26.320
<v Speaker 1>on the old empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Russians were going to finally,</v>

776
00:50:26.321 --> 00:50:29.780
<v Speaker 1>after hundreds of years of wanting it </v>
<v Speaker 1>get constantinople,</v>

777
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Istanbul later byzantium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once upon a time,</v>

778
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.470
<v Speaker 1>this great city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the controls,</v>

779
00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:41.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus and </v>

780
00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:41.730
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

781
00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:44.471
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the access to the Black Sea would be a </v>

782
00:50:44.471 --> 00:50:44.471
<v Speaker 1>huge coup.</v>

783
00:50:44.471 --> 00:50:46.940
<v Speaker 1>The Russians were prevented from doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this by the very British and French that</v>

784
00:50:46.941 --> 00:50:51.590
<v Speaker 1>they were now negotiating with to get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 18 fifties in the Crimean war,</v>

785
00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.530
<v Speaker 1>which propped up the Ottoman Empire for </v>
<v Speaker 1>another generation,</v>

786
00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.410
<v Speaker 1>but now the Russians were on the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>side as the French and the British.</v>

787
00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:02.590
<v Speaker 1>They had all decided that the Ottomans </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to go and they were all going to </v>

788
00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:03.110
<v Speaker 1>agree on what pieces they got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

789
00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:08.140
<v Speaker 1>the payoff for the Russians getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantinople on the regions around </v>

790
00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:11.891
<v Speaker 1>that was that the French and the British</v>
<v Speaker 1>would get to carve up much of what is </v>

791
00:51:11.891 --> 00:51:14.810
<v Speaker 1>now the modern Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't write me the email.</v>

792
00:51:14.811 --> 00:51:19.811
<v Speaker 1>I know that even saying the term Middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>East is a reference to their colonial </v>

793
00:51:19.811 --> 00:51:23.150
<v Speaker 1>past in that region because really if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were going to announce it properly,</v>

794
00:51:23.151 --> 00:51:26.180
<v Speaker 1>you should call it West Asia or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

795
00:51:26.181 --> 00:51:29.030
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't really denote the exact</v>
<v Speaker 1>area you're talking about.</v>

796
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.300
<v Speaker 1>You could get into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

797
00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:31.460
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the areas,</v>

798
00:51:31.461 --> 00:51:34.460
<v Speaker 1>I bet you could say double the lavant or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anatolia or Mesopotamia,</v>

799
00:51:34.461 --> 00:51:38.450
<v Speaker 1>but those are all just pieces of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>term Middle East encompasses.</v>

800
00:51:38.451 --> 00:51:40.730
<v Speaker 1>So I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's not the right phrase.</v>

801
00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know what we mean and certainly </v>

802
00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:48.221
<v Speaker 1>if we're going to talk about the era </v>
<v Speaker 1>where Middle East becomes the colonial </v>

803
00:51:48.221 --> 00:51:51.191
<v Speaker 1>term for the era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not start with the era where it </v>

804
00:51:51.191 --> 00:51:52.820
<v Speaker 1>becomes a colonial possession for non </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic powers,</v>

805
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:58.150
<v Speaker 1>the Sikes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pico agreement and others have France </v>

806
00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:00.401
<v Speaker 1>carving up large chunks of the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arab world and the British taking </v>

807
00:52:00.401 --> 00:52:05.321
<v Speaker 1>northern Iraq and I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the breathtaking they really are.</v>

808
00:52:07.041 --> 00:52:12.041
<v Speaker 1>And when the Bolsheviks released the </v>
<v Speaker 1>secret treaties and the Ottoman </v>

809
00:52:12.041 --> 00:52:14.360
<v Speaker 1>government reads the secret treaties to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own,</v>

810
00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:15.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>group of,</v>

811
00:52:15.551 --> 00:52:17.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobles is the wrong word,</v>

812
00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:20.990
<v Speaker 1>but governmental ministers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

813
00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Eugene Rogan says in his book that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this audible gasp as they hear </v>

814
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:29.210
<v Speaker 1>the plans that France and Britain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia have,</v>

815
00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:31.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the future of the Ottomans,</v>

816
00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:32.900
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be a slap on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrist.</v>

817
00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:37.900
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be dismemberment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the dismemberment of the Ottoman </v>

818
00:52:38.211 --> 00:52:43.211
<v Speaker 1>empire is what creates the modern Middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eastern world that is still such a part </v>

819
00:52:43.211 --> 00:52:47.621
<v Speaker 1>of our lives today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had said earlier that the Bolshevik </v>

820
00:52:47.621 --> 00:52:48.410
<v Speaker 1>revolution was probably the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

821
00:52:48.411 --> 00:52:51.170
<v Speaker 1>long lasting after shock from the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>world war.</v>

822
00:52:51.171 --> 00:52:55.520
<v Speaker 1>But maybe it's better to say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a list of three or four possible</v>

823
00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:57.650
<v Speaker 1>claimants to the throne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>

824
00:52:57.651 --> 00:53:02.651
<v Speaker 1>And maybe another one is the changes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are created in the Middle East </v>

825
00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:06.950
<v Speaker 1>because the Ottoman Empire is broken up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's remember,</v>

826
00:53:06.951 --> 00:53:11.951
<v Speaker 1>this is a 600 year old empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to overstate how long the </v>

827
00:53:13.461 --> 00:53:18.020
<v Speaker 1>structures and the type of rule by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ottoman impacted that area.</v>

828
00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:23.290
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a large area that was under </v>

829
00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Muslim control with a caliphate on paper</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least.</v>

830
00:53:25.501 --> 00:53:30.501
<v Speaker 1>And the leader of the religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least the Sunni branch of it in </v>

831
00:53:30.501 --> 00:53:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Turks ruled that region with an iron</v>

832
00:53:33.511 --> 00:53:34.080
<v Speaker 1>fist.</v>

833
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:39.530
<v Speaker 1>And yet at the same time it was in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process of having huge debates over </v>

834
00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:42.060
<v Speaker 1>modernization and keeping up with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the world.</v>

835
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:47.390
<v Speaker 1>And they were just a few years from </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding out that they sat at the top </v>

836
00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:51.480
<v Speaker 1>some of the world's greatest deposits of</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil on the planet,</v>

837
00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:56.930
<v Speaker 1>which some more conspiratorial </v>
<v Speaker 1>historians will will weave into the </v>

838
00:53:56.930 --> 00:54:01.101
<v Speaker 1>story and point out that it wasn't an </v>
<v Speaker 1>accident that the French and the </v>

839
00:54:01.101 --> 00:54:01.101
<v Speaker 1>British,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

840
00:54:01.101 --> 00:54:04.020
<v Speaker 1>we're deciding that it was worth tearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the Ottoman Empire at this point,</v>

841
00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:10.310
<v Speaker 1>but if they hadn't and somehow the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ottoman empire existed in another 10 or </v>

842
00:54:10.310 --> 00:54:13.470
<v Speaker 1>20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about the inheritance it was about</v>

843
00:54:13.471 --> 00:54:18.471
<v Speaker 1>to come into as a giant multiethnic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic state with oil wealth coming </v>

844
00:54:23.611 --> 00:54:24.480
<v Speaker 1>into the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just.</v>

845
00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:27.450
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating to ponder how different</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world might be,</v>

846
00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:30.330
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a member of the government</v>
<v Speaker 1>of autumn,</v>

847
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you hear the news about how you're </v>

848
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:36.870
<v Speaker 1>going to be dismembered as part of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>secret agreements that become public,</v>

849
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:40.350
<v Speaker 1>you're getting that information about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

850
00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:45.380
<v Speaker 1>maybe even a little less than a week on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heels of some other information.</v>

851
00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:50.810
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should have warned you that this was </v>

852
00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:52.461
<v Speaker 1>coming because everybody awoke to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>declaration that was published on </v>

853
00:54:52.461 --> 00:54:53.940
<v Speaker 1>November second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1917.</v>

854
00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:57.090
<v Speaker 1>That appeared in a bunch of newspapers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and kind of went viral,</v>

855
00:54:57.091 --> 00:55:02.091
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could say by the standards </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the early 20th century and the </v>

856
00:55:02.091 --> 00:55:05.190
<v Speaker 1>statements said this quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>His Majesty's government view with favor</v>

857
00:55:05.191 --> 00:55:10.191
<v Speaker 1>the establishment in Palestine of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>national home for the Jewish people and </v>

858
00:55:10.411 --> 00:55:15.411
<v Speaker 1>will use their best endeavors to </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitate the achievement of this </v>

859
00:55:15.411 --> 00:55:17.160
<v Speaker 1>object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It being clearly understood that nothing</v>

860
00:55:17.161 --> 00:55:22.161
<v Speaker 1>shall be done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which may prejudice the civil and </v>

861
00:55:22.161 --> 00:55:24.591
<v Speaker 1>religious rights of existing non Jewish </v>
<v Speaker 1>communities in Palestine or the rights </v>

862
00:55:24.591 --> 00:55:28.821
<v Speaker 1>and political status enjoyed by Jews in </v>
<v Speaker 1>any other countries and to quote so you </v>

863
00:55:29.491 --> 00:55:34.491
<v Speaker 1>get that on November second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the news on the eighth or the </v>

864
00:55:34.491 --> 00:55:34.491
<v Speaker 1>ninth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know about the sites,</v>

865
00:55:34.491 --> 00:55:39.441
<v Speaker 1>Pico agreement in the others that don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>just tear up your empire and give it to </v>

866
00:55:39.441 --> 00:55:41.700
<v Speaker 1>the victorious powers if they're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be victorious,</v>

867
00:55:41.701 --> 00:55:46.701
<v Speaker 1>that's still up in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also gives it to peoples who are </v>

868
00:55:46.701 --> 00:55:48.150
<v Speaker 1>currently in your empire.</v>

869
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most notably Arab people in a very </v>

870
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:57.900
<v Speaker 1>similar move to what the Germans had </v>
<v Speaker 1>done when they sent Vladimir Lenin to go</v>

871
00:55:57.901 --> 00:56:00.780
<v Speaker 1>into Russia and destabilize that </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

872
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:05.960
<v Speaker 1>The British had been working with </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjects of the Ottoman empire and </v>

873
00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:10.221
<v Speaker 1>encouraging them to rebel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were a couple of important Arab </v>

874
00:56:10.221 --> 00:56:14.121
<v Speaker 1>tribal leaders that were already sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking along those lines and may have </v>

875
00:56:14.121 --> 00:56:16.080
<v Speaker 1>had contact with the British even before</v>
<v Speaker 1>war broke out,</v>

876
00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.940
<v Speaker 1>who by 1915,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

877
00:56:17.941 --> 00:56:21.780
<v Speaker 1>16 were convinced to rebel against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ottoman overlords.</v>

878
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:27.080
<v Speaker 1>They had a lot of British help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They eventually went from a bunch of </v>

879
00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:30.640
<v Speaker 1>ragtag gorillas to a a relatively nasty </v>
<v Speaker 1>guerrilla force in the region.</v>

880
00:56:30.641 --> 00:56:35.641
<v Speaker 1>Although the impact that they had on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>war has been argued about forever with </v>

881
00:56:35.641 --> 00:56:36.550
<v Speaker 1>historians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very colorful story.</v>

882
00:56:36.551 --> 00:56:39.520
<v Speaker 1>It involves this person that's called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence of Arabia.</v>

883
00:56:39.521 --> 00:56:42.130
<v Speaker 1>They made a movie about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot more to that,</v>

884
00:56:42.131 --> 00:56:47.131
<v Speaker 1>including the most important people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were these two tribal families </v>

885
00:56:47.131 --> 00:56:50.110
<v Speaker 1>that the British were able to convince </v>
<v Speaker 1>to rebel against the Ottomans,</v>

886
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:51.730
<v Speaker 1>both of whom were important.</v>

887
00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:56.730
<v Speaker 1>One controlled the area around Mecca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other had a name now graces the </v>

888
00:56:58.091 --> 00:57:02.230
<v Speaker 1>front of the country that occupies the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabian peninsula.</v>

889
00:57:02.231 --> 00:57:07.231
<v Speaker 1>Saudi and the other family put kings on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thrones of multiple post World War </v>

890
00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:11.170
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle Eastern nations.</v>

891
00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:16.120
<v Speaker 1>The kings of Iraq came from this family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kings of places like Jordan,</v>

892
00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:19.180
<v Speaker 1>the current king of Jordan is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>descendant of this family.</v>

893
00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:23.560
<v Speaker 1>And that power emanated from this first </v>
<v Speaker 1>world war,</v>

894
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:28.590
<v Speaker 1>throwing their lot in with the allies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

895
00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:31.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaping the reward.</v>

896
00:57:31.121 --> 00:57:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be pointed out that the reward</v>

897
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:39.480
<v Speaker 1>was not what they'd planned and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British after the war found themselves </v>

898
00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:43.441
<v Speaker 1>in a rather uncomfortable position when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they realized that they had promised </v>

899
00:57:43.441 --> 00:57:47.551
<v Speaker 1>multiple things to multiple people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And oftentimes it was the same stuff.</v>

900
00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:52.270
<v Speaker 1>This will lead to some embarrassing </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments after the war,</v>

901
00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:55.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over questions about fine print and what</v>

902
00:57:55.451 --> 00:58:00.430
<v Speaker 1>was really sad and meant a Sir Henry </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilson who was the chief of the imperial</v>

903
00:58:00.431 --> 00:58:05.431
<v Speaker 1>general staff in 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 will tell another British general </v>

904
00:58:05.431 --> 00:58:05.431
<v Speaker 1>quote.</v>

905
00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:10.440
<v Speaker 1>We have made so many promises to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody in a contradictory sense that </v>

906
00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:15.061
<v Speaker 1>I cannot for the life of me see how we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get out of our president mess </v>

907
00:58:15.061 --> 00:58:16.450
<v Speaker 1>without breaking our word to somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>and quote.</v>

908
00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:22.110
<v Speaker 1>And it's easy to see why the Arabs had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been promised things and what it was </v>

909
00:58:22.110 --> 00:58:25.000
<v Speaker 1>hoped that they would do the rebellion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's been more argued about in is more</v>

910
00:58:25.001 --> 00:58:28.630
<v Speaker 1>interesting for historians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is trying to figure out what was,</v>

911
00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:31.810
<v Speaker 1>what was to be achieved by the Balfour </v>
<v Speaker 1>Declaration.</v>

912
00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:35.440
<v Speaker 1>And there are so many different </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationales that have been put forward.</v>

913
00:58:35.441 --> 00:58:38.620
<v Speaker 1>That could be a study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an interesting show in and of itself.</v>

914
00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:44.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it runs the gamut too from people who </v>

915
00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:44.230
<v Speaker 1>are suggesting that the reason the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British throw their weight behind,</v>

916
00:58:44.610 --> 00:58:46.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Jewish homeland in Palestine has to do</v>

917
00:58:46.871 --> 00:58:49.600
<v Speaker 1>with a personal relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish guy who helped,</v>

918
00:58:49.770 --> 00:58:52.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it easier to create a weapon.</v>

919
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:55.960
<v Speaker 1>There's another theory that it was hoped</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they could have a,</v>

920
00:58:55.961 --> 00:59:00.961
<v Speaker 1>the British,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the friendly people to occupy </v>

921
00:59:00.961 --> 00:59:03.481
<v Speaker 1>this important area to sort of help </v>
<v Speaker 1>guard Britain's imperial possessions in </v>

922
00:59:03.481 --> 00:59:05.920
<v Speaker 1>places like India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my favorite of the many,</v>

923
00:59:05.921 --> 00:59:09.460
<v Speaker 1>many theories out there for why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Balfour Declaration,</v>

924
00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:13.960
<v Speaker 1>this important benchmark moment in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of modern Zionism happened.</v>

925
00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:19.290
<v Speaker 1>My favorite is the antisemetic reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it might've happened that some </v>

926
00:59:19.290 --> 00:59:23.221
<v Speaker 1>people put forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that there were both a </v>

927
00:59:23.221 --> 00:59:25.720
<v Speaker 1>combination of real antisemites out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and people who were pretty </v>

928
00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:30.311
<v Speaker 1>educated in pretty sure that it was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>a canard when people said the Jews ruled</v>

929
00:59:30.951 --> 00:59:34.040
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just in case it wasn't,</v>

930
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:39.190
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be worth it just to be on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the safe side if we made sure that </v>

931
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Jewish public interest the world over </v>
<v Speaker 1>was on our side.</v>

932
00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:46.720
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British were even worried about </v>

933
00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:49.781
<v Speaker 1>rumors that the Germans were going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>offer the Jews a homeland if Jews sort </v>

934
00:59:49.931 --> 00:59:54.931
<v Speaker 1>of signed on with the German cars and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an effort to make sure that if the </v>

935
00:59:54.931 --> 00:59:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Jews controlled the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were on our side,</v>

936
00:59:56.690 --> 00:59:59.720
<v Speaker 1>that we were going to have a statement </v>
<v Speaker 1>made that said,</v>

937
00:59:59.721 --> 01:00:03.560
<v Speaker 1>we supported a return to Palestine for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jewish folks.</v>

938
01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:04.590
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without that,</v>

939
01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.980
<v Speaker 1>just that's the most perverse of all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>excuses,</v>

940
01:00:06.981 --> 01:00:11.981
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it did was plant a seed that later </v>

941
01:00:12.951 --> 01:00:15.860
<v Speaker 1>on we all understand will grow into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

942
01:00:15.861 --> 01:00:17.930
<v Speaker 1>the modern Middle East that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

943
01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:24.470
<v Speaker 1>There's also that one other little </v>
<v Speaker 1>element that of course plays a role in </v>

944
01:00:24.961 --> 01:00:29.961
<v Speaker 1>this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We mentioned it a little bit ago that </v>

945
01:00:29.961 --> 01:00:33.651
<v Speaker 1>turns this region from what you easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have suggested might be a </v>

946
01:00:34.651 --> 01:00:39.651
<v Speaker 1>backwater in the middle of nowhere after</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war was over with some important </v>

947
01:00:39.651 --> 01:00:44.301
<v Speaker 1>religious sacred sites and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not much going on in the way of </v>

948
01:00:44.301 --> 01:00:47.831
<v Speaker 1>resources or value or anything where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>great powers on the world stage would </v>

949
01:00:47.831 --> 01:00:51.891
<v Speaker 1>care much for this area and instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>transforms this region into perhaps the </v>

950
01:00:53.551 --> 01:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>most strategically valuable spot on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

951
01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:04.150
<v Speaker 1>It's because all of a sudden the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>realizes the importance that oil and </v>

952
01:01:05.451 --> 01:01:10.451
<v Speaker 1>petroleum is going to play in the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century world and everybody's sort of </v>

953
01:01:10.451 --> 01:01:14.951
<v Speaker 1>realize it at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of my favorite parts of the </v>

954
01:01:14.951 --> 01:01:19.301
<v Speaker 1>first world war story too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's so hard to figure out what </v>

955
01:01:19.301 --> 01:01:22.451
<v Speaker 1>people knew when there had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>visionaries all throughout the </v>

956
01:01:22.451 --> 01:01:27.251
<v Speaker 1>development of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Realization that oil was going to be </v>

957
01:01:27.251 --> 01:01:27.890
<v Speaker 1>huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

958
01:01:27.891 --> 01:01:31.160
<v Speaker 1>they start pumping this stuff and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>1840 [inaudible],</v>

959
01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:36.170
<v Speaker 1>50 [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 sixties and a bunch of different </v>

960
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:38.081
<v Speaker 1>places and refining it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the main reason it's important in </v>

961
01:01:38.081 --> 01:01:42.041
<v Speaker 1>the 18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the 18 hundreds is part of the </v>

962
01:01:42.041 --> 01:01:45.041
<v Speaker 1>industrial revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The industrial revolution was a </v>

963
01:01:45.041 --> 01:01:48.071
<v Speaker 1>revolution that functioned mostly with </v>
<v Speaker 1>coal as the energy source.</v>

964
01:01:48.081 --> 01:01:53.081
<v Speaker 1>Although steam was also used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that are making the decisions</v>

965
01:01:53.481 --> 01:01:58.340
<v Speaker 1>in the first world war are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>men in age groups who grew up in a world</v>

966
01:01:58.341 --> 01:02:00.380
<v Speaker 1>powered by coal and steam</v>

967
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:06.440
<v Speaker 1>oil was becoming quite valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for different reasons than energy.</v>

968
01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could still say it was </v>

969
01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>energy was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an illumination source and a lot </v>

970
01:02:13.790 --> 01:02:16.211
<v Speaker 1>of places they used it for light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also used it for lubrication and </v>

971
01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people did foresee what maybe you </v>

972
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:26.031
<v Speaker 1>could call the vehicular revolution that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first world war would so plainly </v>

973
01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>sort of put on steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was coming anyway,</v>

974
01:02:30.361 --> 01:02:35.361
<v Speaker 1>but you know how war tends to speed up </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological progress because while </v>

975
01:02:35.361 --> 01:02:39.741
<v Speaker 1>it's life or death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the famous stories of the first </v>

976
01:02:39.741 --> 01:02:43.281
<v Speaker 1>World War is the famous battle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marne story of the taxi cabs of Paris </v>

977
01:02:43.281 --> 01:02:48.050
<v Speaker 1>lining up to ferry troops to the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>hot spot on the battle front that was in</v>

978
01:02:48.451 --> 01:02:53.451
<v Speaker 1>near danger of breaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all the romantic story that </v>

979
01:02:53.451 --> 01:02:55.020
<v Speaker 1>helps illustrate one of the really early</v>
<v Speaker 1>trends in the first world war,</v>

980
01:02:55.021 --> 01:03:00.021
<v Speaker 1>the use of vehicles in to change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation on the battlefield for all of </v>

981
01:03:01.051 --> 01:03:01.950
<v Speaker 1>human history.</v>

982
01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Men have either been walking themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>or utilizing,</v>

983
01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:08.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural animal power in this battle.</v>

984
01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:13.700
<v Speaker 1>They were starting to use things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were powered by gasoline and you would </v>

985
01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:17.430
<v Speaker 1>go from cars and taxi cabs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two trucks,</v>

986
01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:21.750
<v Speaker 1>two tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have aircraft try to imagine,</v>

987
01:03:21.751 --> 01:03:25.140
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure Leonardo Davinci could do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>great sketch of it in the renaissance,</v>

988
01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:30.320
<v Speaker 1>but try to imagine aircraft that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>coal or steam powered.</v>

989
01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:36.620
<v Speaker 1>You kind of needed this dense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>portable energy source that became part </v>

990
01:03:37.081 --> 01:03:42.081
<v Speaker 1>of internal combustion engines and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff sort of happened during the </v>

991
01:03:42.271 --> 01:03:47.271
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The visionaries had been people like </v>

992
01:03:47.271 --> 01:03:51.171
<v Speaker 1>Churchill who had said convert the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British fleet to oil burning instead of </v>

993
01:03:51.171 --> 01:03:54.690
<v Speaker 1>coal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was ahead of his time in like 19.</v>

994
01:03:54.691 --> 01:03:59.691
<v Speaker 1>Oh eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British government was making deals </v>

995
01:03:59.691 --> 01:04:01.611
<v Speaker 1>with an oil company in Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the Anglo Persian oil </v>

996
01:04:01.611 --> 01:04:05.451
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very powerful and very important </v>

997
01:04:05.451 --> 01:04:07.281
<v Speaker 1>for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once again shows that some people </v>

998
01:04:07.281 --> 01:04:08.520
<v Speaker 1>were on top of this or as some </v>
<v Speaker 1>historians have suggested,</v>

999
01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:12.060
<v Speaker 1>they may have just been doing this for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lubrication and illumination value.</v>

1000
01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:14.880
<v Speaker 1>They may not have foreseen the vehicular</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution either,</v>

1001
01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:17.070
<v Speaker 1>but once it strikes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1002
01:04:17.071 --> 01:04:19.710
<v Speaker 1>even people who aren't all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>visionary can see,</v>

1003
01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:21.500
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1004
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:26.510
<v Speaker 1>oil is the coal of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I often think to myself,</v>

1005
01:04:26.911 --> 01:04:31.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you found the oil of the 21st </v>

1006
01:04:31.911 --> 01:04:35.631
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some clean burning immensely wonderful </v>

1007
01:04:35.631 --> 01:04:37.500
<v Speaker 1>replacement to oil that could do all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these fantastic things,</v>

1008
01:04:37.501 --> 01:04:42.090
<v Speaker 1>but it only appeared in a few separate </v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated regions.</v>

1009
01:04:42.091 --> 01:04:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Around the globe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think the governments of the</v>

1010
01:04:45.451 --> 01:04:50.451
<v Speaker 1>world would do today about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean here I've been critical of the </v>

1011
01:04:51.301 --> 01:04:56.301
<v Speaker 1>great powers for some of the horse </v>
<v Speaker 1>trading that was apparent in all their </v>

1012
01:04:56.461 --> 01:05:01.461
<v Speaker 1>war aims and have probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>overemphasized that to a degree </v>

1013
01:05:01.461 --> 01:05:03.660
<v Speaker 1>considering how much geopolitics did </v>
<v Speaker 1>play a role in economics,</v>

1014
01:05:03.661 --> 01:05:06.480
<v Speaker 1>did play a role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first world war had a lot of reasons</v>

1015
01:05:06.481 --> 01:05:11.481
<v Speaker 1>and the reasons that countries got into </v>
<v Speaker 1>it had a lot of different causes and </v>

1016
01:05:11.481 --> 01:05:14.481
<v Speaker 1>nuances as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the horse trading nature of </v>

1017
01:05:14.481 --> 01:05:17.040
<v Speaker 1>territories that seems to stand out so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much to modern.</v>

1018
01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:24.700
<v Speaker 4>It does make me think however,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that if that 21st century version of oil</v>

1019
01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:29.970
<v Speaker 4>were found tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in limited amounts and in limited </v>

1020
01:05:29.970 --> 01:05:30.610
<v Speaker 4>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1021
01:05:30.670 --> 01:05:35.670
<v Speaker 4>I do wonder whether our governments </v>
<v Speaker 4>would act any differently in terms of </v>

1022
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:38.050
<v Speaker 4>the way they would approach it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then that first world war leadership,</v>

1023
01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:44.400
<v Speaker 4>if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine that what they learned </v>

1024
01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.790
<v Speaker 4>from the first world war is not what to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do or what not to do,</v>

1025
01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:51.360
<v Speaker 4>but perhaps have a better sense of how </v>
<v Speaker 4>you justify what you do in the first </v>

1026
01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:56.881
<v Speaker 4>World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our modern sensibilities and to the </v>

1027
01:05:56.881 --> 01:05:59.581
<v Speaker 4>changing sensibilities of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It all seemed a little too naked </v>

1028
01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:03.481
<v Speaker 4>sometimes once it was exposed to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>light of day and yet it's hard to blame </v>

1029
01:06:03.641 --> 01:06:08.641
<v Speaker 4>any of these powers for doing whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>it took to see to it that you could get </v>

1030
01:06:09.971 --> 01:06:14.971
<v Speaker 4>yourself some of this new 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 4>version of coal because it could </v>

1031
01:06:16.031 --> 01:06:21.031
<v Speaker 4>literally be a matter of life or death </v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of remaining a great power and </v>

1032
01:06:22.931 --> 01:06:26.470
<v Speaker 4>as normally happens in the lottery for </v>
<v Speaker 4>natural resources.</v>

1033
01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:31.740
<v Speaker 4>Some places we're blessed with lots of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff and other places with almost </v>

1034
01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:36.181
<v Speaker 4>none.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The United States is one of the first </v>

1035
01:06:36.181 --> 01:06:39.481
<v Speaker 4>places where the first grade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's the Saudi Arabia of the </v>

1036
01:06:39.481 --> 01:06:41.050
<v Speaker 4>first grade oil boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the United States.</v>

1037
01:06:41.051 --> 01:06:44.950
<v Speaker 4>They find it in Pennsylvania initially </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then in a ton of other places.</v>

1038
01:06:44.951 --> 01:06:49.951
<v Speaker 4>The United States is one of the great </v>
<v Speaker 4>oil producing nations of all time and </v>

1039
01:06:49.951 --> 01:06:52.810
<v Speaker 4>they really come into their own right </v>
<v Speaker 4>when the oil really takes off.</v>

1040
01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.280
<v Speaker 4>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very late 18,</v>

1041
01:06:54.281 --> 01:06:55.600
<v Speaker 4>hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>early 19 hundreds.</v>

1042
01:06:56.230 --> 01:07:01.230
<v Speaker 4>Russia also has some wonderful reserves </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have been under development from </v>

1043
01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:05.791
<v Speaker 4>very early on in Baku in places in </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's now a parts of Azerbaijan and the</v>

1044
01:07:06.251 --> 01:07:09.070
<v Speaker 4>problem they were having of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as this Bolshevik revolution,</v>

1045
01:07:09.071 --> 01:07:12.550
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these out of the way places on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Russian periphery.</v>

1046
01:07:12.551 --> 01:07:17.551
<v Speaker 4>We're deciding maybe to go on their own </v>
<v Speaker 4>and take the oil with them,</v>

1047
01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:21.020
<v Speaker 4>so temporary problems for the Russians </v>
<v Speaker 4>in who,</v>

1048
01:07:21.021 --> 01:07:26.021
<v Speaker 4>but what that does is create a situation</v>
<v Speaker 4>where there's a giant wonderful supply </v>

1049
01:07:27.431 --> 01:07:32.431
<v Speaker 4>of oil sitting there with no big </v>
<v Speaker 4>government controlling it temporarily </v>

1050
01:07:32.431 --> 01:07:37.261
<v Speaker 4>because the bolsheviks yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their whole thing is in disorder and </v>

1051
01:07:37.261 --> 01:07:38.020
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to get a handle on things</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're preaching self determination</v>

1052
01:07:38.021 --> 01:07:39.490
<v Speaker 4>and people are taking them up on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>offer.</v>

1053
01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:44.490
<v Speaker 4>And Bach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was all of a sudden you're going to </v>

1054
01:07:44.490 --> 01:07:44.490
<v Speaker 4>break away and become part of some maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>Azerbaijani state.</v>

1055
01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:49.740
<v Speaker 4>That is just too much of a temptation </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a bunch of great powers that look at</v>

1056
01:07:50.381 --> 01:07:55.381
<v Speaker 4>it and think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet I could get there with an army if </v>

1057
01:07:55.381 --> 01:07:57.520
<v Speaker 4>I tried hard enough and what if we could</v>
<v Speaker 4>seize the oil fields of buck?</v>

1058
01:07:57.521 --> 01:08:02.521
<v Speaker 4>Who the only other good source anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>around Europe was in Romania and about </v>

1059
01:08:04.181 --> 01:08:09.181
<v Speaker 4>1917.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the great powers realize we got to </v>

1060
01:08:09.181 --> 01:08:11.110
<v Speaker 4>get ourselves some oil and the British </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the French and the Germans.</v>

1061
01:08:11.111 --> 01:08:13.270
<v Speaker 4>Three of the great powers on the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage.</v>

1062
01:08:13.271 --> 01:08:18.271
<v Speaker 4>When the first world war started,</v>
<v Speaker 4>none of them have good access to large </v>

1063
01:08:18.271 --> 01:08:22.060
<v Speaker 4>amounts of oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to suggest that there is any </v>

1064
01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:28.180
<v Speaker 4>bigger national security concern for </v>
<v Speaker 4>those nations at this point than to </v>

1065
01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:32.531
<v Speaker 4>secure themselves a supply of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>century's great energy source and the </v>

1066
01:08:33.891 --> 01:08:38.891
<v Speaker 4>one that's needed to power the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>cutting edge weapons that you need to </v>

1067
01:08:38.891 --> 01:08:42.020
<v Speaker 4>win any war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's easy to be critical</v>

1068
01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:45.600
<v Speaker 4>of these people pursuing these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>policies,</v>

1069
01:08:45.601 --> 01:08:50.601
<v Speaker 4>but look at what the stakes are and from</v>
<v Speaker 4>a purely real politique down and dirty </v>

1070
01:08:53.670 --> 01:08:58.670
<v Speaker 4>standard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the arguments for imperialism in this </v>

1071
01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:01.560
<v Speaker 4>case make a certain kind of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean what they're saying,</v>

1072
01:09:01.561 --> 01:09:04.640
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>amongst British politicians,</v>

1073
01:09:04.641 --> 01:09:08.550
<v Speaker 4>some of whom do not want to go in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>control these areas.</v>

1074
01:09:08.551 --> 01:09:12.180
<v Speaker 4>The prime minister before the current </v>
<v Speaker 4>prime minister in 1917,</v>

1075
01:09:12.181 --> 01:09:13.590
<v Speaker 4>Herbert Asquith,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1076
01:09:13.591 --> 01:09:18.591
<v Speaker 4>he didn't want anything to do with this </v>
<v Speaker 4>region and all of its problems and </v>

1077
01:09:18.591 --> 01:09:21.771
<v Speaker 4>factionalism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the Arab tribes that were </v>

1078
01:09:21.771 --> 01:09:24.261
<v Speaker 4>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting on Britain's side as part of </v>

1079
01:09:24.261 --> 01:09:24.300
<v Speaker 4>the Arab revolt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're only part of the Arabs out there.</v>

1080
01:09:24.301 --> 01:09:29.301
<v Speaker 4>There were a lot of other areas that </v>
<v Speaker 4>were very loyal to the Ottoman </v>

1081
01:09:29.301 --> 01:09:32.241
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had a Sunni and Shiite issues to </v>

1082
01:09:32.241 --> 01:09:32.520
<v Speaker 4>deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean to to ask what it looked like,</v>

1083
01:09:32.521 --> 01:09:37.521
<v Speaker 4>a hornet's nest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he had a hard time fighting against </v>

1084
01:09:37.521 --> 01:09:41.301
<v Speaker 4>the people on the other side of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>argument who were making the point that </v>

1085
01:09:41.301 --> 01:09:44.901
<v Speaker 4>you were then going to simply see </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever could be taken from the </v>

1086
01:09:44.901 --> 01:09:49.851
<v Speaker 4>Ottomans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once they were gone to your great power </v>

1087
01:09:49.851 --> 01:09:51.990
<v Speaker 4>rivals mean the French will go in then </v>
<v Speaker 4>and take the oil perhaps,</v>

1088
01:09:51.991 --> 01:09:56.991
<v Speaker 4>and then they're strengthened while you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are weakened and you don't have any </v>

1089
01:09:56.991 --> 01:10:01.251
<v Speaker 4>access to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Cole of the 20th century has asked </v>

1090
01:10:01.251 --> 01:10:02.310
<v Speaker 4>with eventually said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1091
01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:03.320
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

1092
01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:08.390
<v Speaker 4>if we were to leave the other nations to</v>
<v Speaker 4>scramble for Turkey without taking </v>

1093
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:10.680
<v Speaker 4>anything ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should not be doing our duty.</v>

1094
01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:11.880
<v Speaker 4>End Quote,</v>

1095
01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.290
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if not,</v>

1096
01:10:15.291 --> 01:10:20.291
<v Speaker 4>having access to your own oil meant that</v>
<v Speaker 4>your country would fall to a second </v>

1097
01:10:20.961 --> 01:10:25.961
<v Speaker 4>class status.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there would have been a lot of </v>

1098
01:10:25.961 --> 01:10:28.930
<v Speaker 4>people in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a democratic government who would have </v>

1099
01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:32.960
<v Speaker 4>said that it was their politicians duty </v>
<v Speaker 4>to see that that didn't happen.</v>

1100
01:10:34.170 --> 01:10:39.170
<v Speaker 4>Now the last time we checked in with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>story in the Middle East and all that </v>

1101
01:10:39.170 --> 01:10:43.551
<v Speaker 4>area concerning the Ottomans fighting </v>
<v Speaker 4>against the British and the French and </v>

1102
01:10:43.551 --> 01:10:47.031
<v Speaker 4>the British Dominion troops from places </v>
<v Speaker 4>like India and South Africa and </v>

1103
01:10:47.031 --> 01:10:48.000
<v Speaker 4>Australia and New Zealand and places </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

1104
01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:51.210
<v Speaker 4>that the war hadn't been going </v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly well.</v>

1105
01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:56.630
<v Speaker 4>The Turks were tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put up a pretty darn good </v>

1106
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:58.050
<v Speaker 4>resistance for a country that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be basically done,</v>

1107
01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:01.050
<v Speaker 4>having just fought a couple of wars </v>
<v Speaker 4>previously,</v>

1108
01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:03.510
<v Speaker 4>economics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're in a disaster and everything,</v>

1109
01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:06.990
<v Speaker 4>and instead the Turks put up a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>darn spirited resistance.</v>

1110
01:11:06.991 --> 01:11:08.910
<v Speaker 4>They've got the Germans in there helping</v>
<v Speaker 4>them to,</v>

1111
01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:14.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>modernize a little here and there and </v>

1112
01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:16.521
<v Speaker 4>the British simply were not and who </v>
<v Speaker 4>could be for the logistical challenges </v>

1113
01:11:16.891 --> 01:11:21.891
<v Speaker 4>that trying to maintain large armies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which the British didn't tend to </v>

1114
01:11:21.891 --> 01:11:23.310
<v Speaker 4>maintain in the field anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>throughout their history,</v>

1115
01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:26.760
<v Speaker 4>in the middle of the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the challenges were huge.</v>

1116
01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:31.760
<v Speaker 4>The Turks were tough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The British essentially had to retreat </v>

1117
01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:35.601
<v Speaker 4>from politically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got trapped in a place called </v>

1118
01:11:35.601 --> 01:11:38.230
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we told you in an earlier episode </v>

1119
01:11:38.230 --> 01:11:38.880
<v Speaker 4>and had to surrender.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was not exactly their finest hour,</v>

1120
01:11:38.881 --> 01:11:43.881
<v Speaker 4>but in their defense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of their effort is in the meat </v>

1121
01:11:43.881 --> 01:11:43.890
<v Speaker 4>grinder area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On the western front.</v>

1122
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:49.230
<v Speaker 4>This is an area that some people </v>
<v Speaker 4>referred to as a side show,</v>

1123
01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:55.610
<v Speaker 4>and this gets back to the argument we've</v>
<v Speaker 4>mentioned earlier between those in the </v>

1124
01:11:55.610 --> 01:11:59.361
<v Speaker 4>allied camp that called themselves or </v>
<v Speaker 4>were called Westerners and the others </v>

1125
01:11:59.361 --> 01:12:03.030
<v Speaker 4>who were called easterners,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people whose ideas said that the western</v>

1126
01:12:03.031 --> 01:12:08.031
<v Speaker 4>front,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the meat grinder is the focal point of </v>

1127
01:12:08.031 --> 01:12:08.031
<v Speaker 4>the war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be decided there,</v>

1128
01:12:08.031 --> 01:12:12.890
<v Speaker 4>so taking troops and sending them to any</v>
<v Speaker 4>other part of the war is to work against</v>

1129
01:12:13.801 --> 01:12:15.780
<v Speaker 4>what you need to be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is breaking through it.</v>

1130
01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:18.270
<v Speaker 4>The key point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other group,</v>

1131
01:12:18.271 --> 01:12:23.271
<v Speaker 4>the easterners believed that throwing </v>
<v Speaker 4>troops into the meat grinder where </v>

1132
01:12:23.271 --> 01:12:27.381
<v Speaker 4>things were stalemated was a callus </v>
<v Speaker 4>waste of lives when there were </v>

1133
01:12:27.381 --> 01:12:30.540
<v Speaker 4>vulnerable points all on the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>map.</v>

1134
01:12:30.541 --> 01:12:33.600
<v Speaker 4>That could be exploited,</v>
<v Speaker 4>easier places to go.</v>

1135
01:12:33.810 --> 01:12:38.810
<v Speaker 4>Winston Churchill in the Second World </v>
<v Speaker 4>War was always looking for the soft </v>

1136
01:12:38.810 --> 01:12:40.680
<v Speaker 4>underbelly of Europe was the way the </v>
<v Speaker 4>phrased was turned.</v>

1137
01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:45.920
<v Speaker 4>In the first World War,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were easterners looking for the </v>

1138
01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:48.321
<v Speaker 4>soft underbelly of Europe and the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>argument I've ever heard for who was </v>

1139
01:12:49.021 --> 01:12:51.390
<v Speaker 4>right because I was looking at Lloyd </v>
<v Speaker 4>George,</v>

1140
01:12:51.391 --> 01:12:54.660
<v Speaker 4>his memoirs the other day and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 years after the war,</v>

1141
01:12:54.661 --> 01:12:59.661
<v Speaker 4>he still justifying and wagging a finger</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the face of the westerners saying we </v>

1142
01:12:59.661 --> 01:13:01.350
<v Speaker 4>were right and the westerners are saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they were right.</v>

1143
01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:05.640
<v Speaker 4>The German General Ludina [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 4>had pointed out that yes,</v>

1144
01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:10.820
<v Speaker 4>the West and the western front meat </v>
<v Speaker 4>grinder was where the war would be </v>

1145
01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:13.020
<v Speaker 4>decided,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if there was a catastrophe on any of</v>

1146
01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:17.460
<v Speaker 4>the other fronts in the war that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would impact German power on the western</v>

1147
01:13:17.461 --> 01:13:20.940
<v Speaker 4>front leading to a loss there so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were interconnected.</v>

1148
01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:25.350
<v Speaker 4>All these non western front battles are </v>
<v Speaker 4>sideshows.</v>

1149
01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:29.280
<v Speaker 4>Unless those fronts collapsed and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a disaster.</v>

1150
01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:35.270
<v Speaker 4>In 1917.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The British who have changed generals </v>

1151
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:39.260
<v Speaker 4>and who have now put a meticulous effort</v>
<v Speaker 4>into just slowly but surely building up </v>

1152
01:13:40.651 --> 01:13:43.800
<v Speaker 4>the infrastructure that you need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>maintain an army in the field.</v>

1153
01:13:43.801 --> 01:13:48.801
<v Speaker 4>They're mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just think of the pipelines of water </v>

1154
01:13:48.801 --> 01:13:52.260
<v Speaker 4>that they build for miles upon miles </v>
<v Speaker 4>upon miles to go out to where the troops</v>

1155
01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:57.261
<v Speaker 4>are going to have to be in trench lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the amount of effort that's </v>

1156
01:13:57.261 --> 01:14:00.351
<v Speaker 4>required,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the buildup of troops and everything </v>

1157
01:14:00.351 --> 01:14:01.950
<v Speaker 4>else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but by 1917 they begin to push the Turks</v>

1158
01:14:01.951 --> 01:14:04.530
<v Speaker 4>back everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're 19,</v>

1159
01:14:04.531 --> 01:14:09.531
<v Speaker 4>17,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and especially the latter half of the </v>

1160
01:14:09.531 --> 01:14:11.541
<v Speaker 4>year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sees multiple victories on the part of </v>

1161
01:14:11.541 --> 01:14:12.700
<v Speaker 4>the British led allied forces in places </v>
<v Speaker 4>like Mesopotamia</v>

1162
01:14:12.730 --> 01:14:13.600
<v Speaker 1>and Palestine,</v>

1163
01:14:15.130 --> 01:14:20.130
<v Speaker 1>lots of outflanking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some wonderfully clever spy maneuvers </v>

1164
01:14:20.130 --> 01:14:24.871
<v Speaker 1>and some fantastic bravery and audacity </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the part of some of these dominion </v>

1165
01:14:25.301 --> 01:14:27.400
<v Speaker 1>mounted infantry forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1166
01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:33.060
<v Speaker 1>end up creating a situation where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British high command can see Jerusalem,</v>

1167
01:14:33.491 --> 01:14:38.491
<v Speaker 1>the holy city of holy cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right sacred to at least three major </v>

1168
01:14:38.491 --> 01:14:38.560
<v Speaker 1>religions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>

1169
01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and Judaism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can see Jerusalem within range and </v>

1170
01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:44.260
<v Speaker 1>they know that they're going to take it </v>
<v Speaker 1>if this,</v>

1171
01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:45.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>momentum continues,</v>

1172
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:51.510
<v Speaker 1>but after dealing with passion Dale and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mud and the blood and the shock and </v>

1173
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:54.550
<v Speaker 1>the sense of never ending war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just wraps up in mid November.</v>

1174
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Lloyd George asks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>British General Allenby if he can manage</v>

1175
01:14:59.351 --> 01:15:04.351
<v Speaker 1>to capture the holy city by Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says it will be a great Christmas </v>

1176
01:15:04.351 --> 01:15:06.800
<v Speaker 1>present for the British people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little pick me up if you will.</v>

1177
01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:12.160
<v Speaker 1>After all of the horribleness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lloyd George gets his wish granted on </v>

1178
01:15:12.951 --> 01:15:17.780
<v Speaker 1>December 11th with the British and </v>
<v Speaker 1>allied forces already in the city,</v>

1179
01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:23.260
<v Speaker 1>they receive a surrender notice from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkish representative who writes,</v>

1180
01:15:23.451 --> 01:15:28.451
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>due to the severity of the siege of the </v>

1181
01:15:28.451 --> 01:15:31.851
<v Speaker 1>city and the suffering that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful country has endured from your </v>

1182
01:15:31.851 --> 01:15:35.220
<v Speaker 1>heavy guns and for fear that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>deadly bombs will hit the holy places.</v>

1183
01:15:35.610 --> 01:15:39.290
<v Speaker 1>We are forced to hand over to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city through Hussein Al Husseini,</v>

1184
01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:44.300
<v Speaker 1>the mayor of Jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hoping that you will protect Jerusalem </v>

1185
01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:46.320
<v Speaker 1>the way we have protected it for more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than 500 years</v>

1186
01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:52.420
<v Speaker 1>and quote doesn't that note sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it all home in terms of the </v>

1187
01:15:54.521 --> 01:15:59.521
<v Speaker 1>immense age of some of these nation </v>
<v Speaker 1>states that we're dealing with here.</v>

1188
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:05.310
<v Speaker 1>There's a ton of irony and symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the allied forces captured </v>

1189
01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:09.871
<v Speaker 1>Jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start with the fact that Christians had </v>

1190
01:16:09.871 --> 01:16:13.561
<v Speaker 1>captured Jerusalem before in 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>99 during the first crusade was a very </v>

1191
01:16:14.451 --> 01:16:17.300
<v Speaker 1>big deal at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>followed by a terrible massacre,</v>

1192
01:16:17.301 --> 01:16:20.780
<v Speaker 1>but the Christians managed to hold the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city for a couple hundred years.</v>

1193
01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:26.800
<v Speaker 1>The Islamic general salary in the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurred by the way we'll retake the </v>

1194
01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:28.850
<v Speaker 1>city during the third crusade and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>late 12 hundreds.</v>

1195
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:34.270
<v Speaker 1>There will be a major crusade in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle Ages launched against these very </v>

1196
01:16:34.521 --> 01:16:39.521
<v Speaker 1>Ottomans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when there are a lot younger </v>

1197
01:16:39.521 --> 01:16:42.851
<v Speaker 1>and more vigorous of an empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now Christian forces were once again</v>

1198
01:16:44.291 --> 01:16:48.800
<v Speaker 1>moving into this city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the propaganda</v>

1199
01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:52.040
<v Speaker 1>possibilities of an event like this are </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge,</v>

1200
01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:56.000
<v Speaker 1>but it also has some real world postwar </v>
<v Speaker 1>implications.</v>

1201
01:16:56.001 --> 01:16:59.930
<v Speaker 1>You know that old line that possession </v>
<v Speaker 1>is nine tenths of the law?</v>

1202
01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will certainly be the case after </v>

1203
01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.451
<v Speaker 1>the war when the British are involved in</v>
<v Speaker 1>not always wonderfully nice negotiations</v>

1204
01:17:07.491 --> 01:17:11.330
<v Speaker 1>with the French and people are locals in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that region over who gets what.</v>

1205
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:17.770
<v Speaker 1>There had been some agreements during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the war that Palestine and Jerusalem </v>

1206
01:17:17.770 --> 01:17:21.491
<v Speaker 1>should be internationalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British didn't like that idea as </v>

1207
01:17:21.491 --> 01:17:25.181
<v Speaker 1>much after the war and since they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones governing there since December </v>

1208
01:17:25.181 --> 01:17:25.820
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>

1209
01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:29.510
<v Speaker 1>gave them a unique ability to decide how</v>
<v Speaker 1>things were going to go,</v>

1210
01:17:29.511 --> 01:17:34.511
<v Speaker 1>so important in a real world sense to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire affair and its importance of </v>

1211
01:17:35.811 --> 01:17:40.811
<v Speaker 1>the entry into this holiest of cities </v>
<v Speaker 1>was understood and stage manage to a </v>

1212
01:17:40.811 --> 01:17:44.480
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British government had some ideas on</v>

1213
01:17:44.481 --> 01:17:49.481
<v Speaker 1>the way we would say today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the optics or the visual should go in </v>

1214
01:17:49.481 --> 01:17:50.000
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>98,</v>

1215
01:17:50.001 --> 01:17:55.001
<v Speaker 1>the German emperor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kaiser had visited Jerusalem again </v>

1216
01:17:55.001 --> 01:17:58.571
<v Speaker 1>with lots of visuals and optics and lots</v>
<v Speaker 1>of photographs and lots of propaganda </v>

1217
01:17:58.571 --> 01:18:02.600
<v Speaker 1>benefits for doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he kind of offended some of the </v>

1218
01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:07.301
<v Speaker 1>religious folks by not really seeming </v>
<v Speaker 1>humble enough in the face of such </v>

1219
01:18:07.301 --> 01:18:10.430
<v Speaker 1>intense sacredness for three of the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>religions on the planet.</v>

1220
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:15.970
<v Speaker 1>There was even a story that the Turks </v>
<v Speaker 1>had to destroy a part of the ancient </v>

1221
01:18:15.970 --> 01:18:16.130
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1222
01:18:16.131 --> 01:18:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Israeli part of the walls to make room </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Kaiser's car.</v>

1223
01:18:20.331 --> 01:18:22.070
<v Speaker 1>So He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he could bring the car in.</v>

1224
01:18:22.071 --> 01:18:27.071
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it certainly made him look bad and </v>

1225
01:18:27.071 --> 01:18:30.431
<v Speaker 1>before Alan b becomes the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian conqueror in more than 500 </v>

1226
01:18:30.561 --> 01:18:35.561
<v Speaker 1>years to walk into Jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets a little advice from British </v>

1227
01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:41.020
<v Speaker 1>General Robertson who tells him in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>telegram quote in the event of Jerusalem</v>

1228
01:18:41.121 --> 01:18:46.121
<v Speaker 1>being occupied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be of considerable political </v>

1229
01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:49.241
<v Speaker 1>importance if you on officially entering</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city dismount at the city gate and </v>

1230
01:18:49.851 --> 01:18:54.851
<v Speaker 1>enter on foot German emperor Rodin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the same went round a better man </v>

1231
01:18:55.401 --> 01:18:59.210
<v Speaker 1>than he walked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Advantage of contrast in conduct will be</v>

1232
01:18:59.211 --> 01:19:04.211
<v Speaker 1>obvious and quote by December 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17.</v>

1233
01:19:06.170 --> 01:19:11.170
<v Speaker 1>It looks as though it won't take a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot for the British and the French and </v>

1234
01:19:11.170 --> 01:19:15.071
<v Speaker 1>the dominion forces to strike at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Turks and just sort of pushed the entire</v>

1235
01:19:15.261 --> 01:19:16.460
<v Speaker 1>house of cards over.</v>

1236
01:19:17.150 --> 01:19:22.150
<v Speaker 1>And in some ways the Turks are not doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves any good because when the </v>

1237
01:19:22.150 --> 01:19:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Russians pulled out of the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it leaves a ton of territories that have</v>

1238
01:19:25.041 --> 01:19:27.110
<v Speaker 1>lots of Turks in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1239
01:19:27.111 --> 01:19:32.111
<v Speaker 1>open for Turkish conquest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Turks are sending armies that </v>

1240
01:19:32.111 --> 01:19:35.531
<v Speaker 1>might be better used against the British</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the French into this territory were </v>

1241
01:19:35.531 --> 01:19:39.350
<v Speaker 1>places like Armenia and Azerbaijan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all those places are in order to get new</v>

1242
01:19:39.351 --> 01:19:42.050
<v Speaker 1>territory while they're losing old </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

1243
01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not the French and the </v>

1244
01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.601
<v Speaker 1>British can just push over the house of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cards now becomes a bit of a moot point </v>

1245
01:19:49.601 --> 01:19:53.600
<v Speaker 1>because very early into 1918 when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>finishing touches on any idea to do that</v>

1246
01:19:53.601 --> 01:19:58.601
<v Speaker 1>would have to be in play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden everything is needed </v>

1247
01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:02.810
<v Speaker 1>back on the western front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allenby is going to have his forces,</v>

1248
01:20:02.811 --> 01:20:07.811
<v Speaker 1>his best forces ripped from him and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforcements or extra force is added </v>

1249
01:20:07.811 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 1>because all of</v>

1250
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:12.980
<v Speaker 4>a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just when everything looked like the </v>

1251
01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:14.250
<v Speaker 4>United States was going to come in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>turn the tide of the war,</v>

1252
01:20:14.850 --> 01:20:19.850
<v Speaker 4>the Germans attempt to turn the tide of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the war first and we mentioned before </v>

1253
01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:27.080
<v Speaker 4>the real differences in sorted the feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the ebb and the flow and the rhythm </v>

1254
01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:31.970
<v Speaker 4>of the two world wars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first and the second world wars in </v>

1255
01:20:31.970 --> 01:20:35.961
<v Speaker 4>the Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a certain point where where </v>

1256
01:20:35.961 --> 01:20:36.720
<v Speaker 4>the outcome of the war was no longer in </v>
<v Speaker 4>doubt,</v>

1257
01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:40.680
<v Speaker 4>but it was quite a ways between that </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment and the end of the war,</v>

1258
01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:44.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably safe to say like late 19,</v>

1259
01:20:44.251 --> 01:20:47.580
<v Speaker 4>43,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone knows that the Germans in their</v>

1260
01:20:47.581 --> 01:20:52.581
<v Speaker 4>site or not winning that war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one knows how many people are going </v>

1261
01:20:52.581 --> 01:20:52.770
<v Speaker 4>to have to die before the outcome is </v>
<v Speaker 4>finally settled,</v>

1262
01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:54.900
<v Speaker 4>but everyone knows what the outcome's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be.</v>

1263
01:20:55.020 --> 01:21:00.020
<v Speaker 4>You can concoct some real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real long shots scenarios where the </v>

1264
01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:03.591
<v Speaker 4>Germans for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get atomic weapons first or something </v>

1265
01:21:03.591 --> 01:21:03.591
<v Speaker 4>like that and change the course of </v>
<v Speaker 4>history,</v>

1266
01:21:03.591 --> 01:21:07.380
<v Speaker 4>but by and large it was a moot point </v>
<v Speaker 4>past a certain period,</v>

1267
01:21:07.381 --> 01:21:08.340
<v Speaker 4>probably late 43.</v>

1268
01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:10.200
<v Speaker 4>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first world war.</v>

1269
01:21:10.201 --> 01:21:13.080
<v Speaker 4>His rhythm was completely unlike that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were,</v>

1270
01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:18.700
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you wanted to say who had the </v>

1271
01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:21.471
<v Speaker 4>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of the time it was the allied </v>

1272
01:21:21.471 --> 01:21:22.950
<v Speaker 4>forces continually putting their weight </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the other side and wearing them down,</v>

1273
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:27.780
<v Speaker 4>but the other side led by Germany would </v>
<v Speaker 4>strike out and lash out at certain times</v>

1274
01:21:27.781 --> 01:21:29.680
<v Speaker 4>with huge blows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1275
01:21:29.690 --> 01:21:32.010
<v Speaker 4>that easily could have knocked the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>side out.</v>

1276
01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:36.540
<v Speaker 4>The last of these Germany throws in </v>
<v Speaker 4>early 19,</v>

1277
01:21:36.541 --> 01:21:39.720
<v Speaker 4>18.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even the members of Germany's,</v>

1278
01:21:39.721 --> 01:21:41.520
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>upper military caste.</v>

1279
01:21:41.521 --> 01:21:46.290
<v Speaker 4>We're calling it the last card.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I have to set a few things up before</v>

1280
01:21:46.291 --> 01:21:49.200
<v Speaker 4>we understand about this last card </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>

1281
01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.230
<v Speaker 4>The first is understanding where the war</v>
<v Speaker 4>is at this point.</v>

1282
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:55.830
<v Speaker 4>Germany's got some good stuff happening </v>
<v Speaker 4>and some bad stuff happening.</v>

1283
01:21:55.831 --> 01:21:59.820
<v Speaker 4>We just mentioned one of the bad things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The situation with their Turkish ally in</v>

1284
01:21:59.821 --> 01:22:02.130
<v Speaker 4>the Middle East is starting to turn for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the worst,</v>

1285
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:02.550
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1286
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:04.920
<v Speaker 4>The latter part of 1917.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not so great,</v>

1287
01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:10.670
<v Speaker 4>but that is offset by good things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>had been happening in that same time </v>

1288
01:22:10.670 --> 01:22:10.680
<v Speaker 4>period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've said is so important.</v>

1289
01:22:10.681 --> 01:22:11.580
<v Speaker 4>October,</v>
<v Speaker 4>November,</v>

1290
01:22:11.581 --> 01:22:12.960
<v Speaker 4>December.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In 1917,</v>

1291
01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:16.440
<v Speaker 4>the Germans send,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually not that much,</v>

1292
01:22:16.441 --> 01:22:21.441
<v Speaker 4>but it made a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some help to their austro-hungarian </v>

1293
01:22:21.441 --> 01:22:24.141
<v Speaker 4>allies who have been fighting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Italians forever in the region of the </v>

1294
01:22:24.141 --> 01:22:28.461
<v Speaker 4>river is Sanzo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have had 11 battles of the zero to </v>

1295
01:22:28.501 --> 01:22:33.501
<v Speaker 4>this point in the war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you can tell how much things are </v>

1296
01:22:33.501 --> 01:22:33.501
<v Speaker 4>moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1297
01:22:33.501 --> 01:22:35.700
<v Speaker 4>It's a stalemate on these Alpine peaks </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they're cutting,</v>

1298
01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:37.890
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hideouts into the ice.</v>

1299
01:22:37.891 --> 01:22:40.260
<v Speaker 4>It's this crazy alpine war they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting,</v>

1300
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:44.500
<v Speaker 4>but both sides are really tired and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Italian troops are really tired of,</v>

1301
01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:46.290
<v Speaker 4>of the guy who's been running the show </v>
<v Speaker 4>for them,</v>

1302
01:22:46.291 --> 01:22:48.390
<v Speaker 4>the general in charge of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of their effort.</v>

1303
01:22:48.391 --> 01:22:53.391
<v Speaker 4>He's really sort of a stickler and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've had it with them and they and </v>

1304
01:22:53.391 --> 01:22:57.831
<v Speaker 4>they've been like their austro-hungarian</v>
<v Speaker 4>enemies putting up with a lot for years </v>

1305
01:22:57.831 --> 01:22:58.980
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of senseless deaths.</v>

1306
01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:00.240
<v Speaker 4>It's just been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been terrible.</v>

1307
01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:02.100
<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden the German </v>
<v Speaker 4>send,</v>

1308
01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:04.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven or eight divisions there to act as</v>

1309
01:23:04.651 --> 01:23:09.651
<v Speaker 4>sort of the edge of another offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The twelfth I Sanzo but it gets known by</v>

1310
01:23:10.811 --> 01:23:15.811
<v Speaker 4>a different name because it stands out </v>
<v Speaker 4>from the other 11 battles of the </v>

1311
01:23:15.811 --> 01:23:19.021
<v Speaker 4>assault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's often called the battle of </v>

1312
01:23:19.021 --> 01:23:19.021
<v Speaker 4>corporate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Righto.</v>

1313
01:23:19.021 --> 01:23:22.170
<v Speaker 4>And the reason it stands out from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other battles of the Assad is because </v>

1314
01:23:22.170 --> 01:23:26.311
<v Speaker 4>this time something decisive happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Italians get smashed and who can </v>

1315
01:23:28.691 --> 01:23:31.690
<v Speaker 4>blame them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Germans are once again using an even</v>

1316
01:23:31.691 --> 01:23:36.340
<v Speaker 4>more perfected version of new tactics </v>
<v Speaker 4>and new artillery methods,</v>

1317
01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:37.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as we said before,</v>

1318
01:23:37.811 --> 01:23:41.140
<v Speaker 4>what you're quickly watching occur in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the four years of the first world war as</v>

1319
01:23:41.141 --> 01:23:45.400
<v Speaker 4>you're watching these armies transform </v>
<v Speaker 4>from something more like you know,</v>

1320
01:23:45.401 --> 01:23:50.401
<v Speaker 4>the Franco Prussian war in the 18 </v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies to something more like the </v>

1321
01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:55.630
<v Speaker 4>Second World War and you can see it as </v>
<v Speaker 4>the tactics develop year after year from</v>

1322
01:23:55.631 --> 01:24:00.631
<v Speaker 4>stupidly walking into machine gun fire </v>
<v Speaker 4>and ordered rows of men to wear </v>

1323
01:24:00.631 --> 01:24:01.120
<v Speaker 4>infiltration.</v>

1324
01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:06.120
<v Speaker 4>Tactics are taking over and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning to see a lot of the same </v>

1325
01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:09.630
<v Speaker 4>methods being employed by these armies </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the very first time that every army </v>

1326
01:24:09.630 --> 01:24:13.240
<v Speaker 4>in the world still uses today involving </v>
<v Speaker 4>fire and movement and mutual support and</v>

1327
01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:17.650
<v Speaker 4>bypassing strong points.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the Germans do this to the poor,</v>

1328
01:24:17.651 --> 01:24:21.430
<v Speaker 4>Italians and the Italians get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean 300,000</v>

1329
01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:26.431
<v Speaker 4>people surrender.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how bad it is and yet the </v>

1330
01:24:26.431 --> 01:24:28.780
<v Speaker 4>Italians are able to move like 60 miles </v>
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

1331
01:24:28.781 --> 01:24:32.740
<v Speaker 4>Reform their lines keep from falling </v>
<v Speaker 4>apart.</v>

1332
01:24:32.770 --> 01:24:34.510
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In a way it help for the British and the</v>

1333
01:24:34.511 --> 01:24:39.511
<v Speaker 4>French.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to take troops again from the </v>

1334
01:24:39.511 --> 01:24:39.640
<v Speaker 4>western front to bolster this other </v>
<v Speaker 4>area,</v>

1335
01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:44.641
<v Speaker 4>but what it means is by the end of 1917,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Germans have knocked out a bunch of </v>

1336
01:24:46.781 --> 01:24:51.781
<v Speaker 4>their opponents in this war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you look at how they started the </v>

1337
01:24:51.781 --> 01:24:53.170
<v Speaker 4>war with all these enemies against them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at what they've done in 1915,</v>

1338
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:58.171
<v Speaker 4>they knock out Serbia in 1916,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they knock out Romania in 1917.</v>

1339
01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:04.740
<v Speaker 4>They've just knocked out Russia from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>war and given Italy such a bloody lip </v>

1340
01:25:05.801 --> 01:25:10.801
<v Speaker 4>that nothing is going to happen down </v>
<v Speaker 4>there for awhile and now in early 1918 </v>

1341
01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:17.040
<v Speaker 4>for the first time in the war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Germans face the British and the </v>

1342
01:25:17.111 --> 01:25:20.620
<v Speaker 4>French without a whole lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>distractions.</v>

1343
01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:26.220
<v Speaker 4>They don't have the Russians on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other side and they have a small window </v>

1344
01:25:27.761 --> 01:25:32.761
<v Speaker 4>of opportunity before millions of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans started arriving in Europe to </v>

1345
01:25:33.551 --> 01:25:38.551
<v Speaker 4>swamp them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the way Winston Churchill </v>

1346
01:25:38.710 --> 01:25:42.730
<v Speaker 4>describes the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the setup we'll say,</v>

1347
01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:47.940
<v Speaker 4>and then I'm going to contrast that with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way adults Hitler does and remember </v>

1348
01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:51.430
<v Speaker 4>that both of these people are writing to</v>
<v Speaker 4>specific audiences.</v>

1349
01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:55.630
<v Speaker 4>Churchill's writing to people who are in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1350
01:25:55.631 --> 01:25:58.200
<v Speaker 4>especially British and American </v>
<v Speaker 4>audiences and really,</v>

1351
01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:00.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a super patriotic,</v>

1352
01:26:00.011 --> 01:26:05.011
<v Speaker 4>romantic sort of an approach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hitler is writing this material for a </v>

1353
01:26:05.011 --> 01:26:09.191
<v Speaker 4>bunch of bitter war veterans who still </v>
<v Speaker 4>ache over what they experienced and and </v>

1354
01:26:11.181 --> 01:26:15.860
<v Speaker 4>this feeling of betrayal and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bitterness since the war ended,</v>

1355
01:26:15.861 --> 01:26:17.780
<v Speaker 4>so they have different audiences they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>writing for,</v>

1356
01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:21.890
<v Speaker 4>but contrasting their styles and the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>they set this up is intriguing.</v>

1357
01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:27.820
<v Speaker 4>Here's how Churchill describes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation and remember and remember the </v>

1358
01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:31.331
<v Speaker 4>end of 1917,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the British are still in shock from the </v>

1359
01:26:31.331 --> 01:26:33.190
<v Speaker 4>battle that they still call passion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dale Churchill</v>

1360
01:26:33.190 --> 01:26:33.730
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

1361
01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:40.480
<v Speaker 4>as the passion Dale struggled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>died away in the storms and mud of </v>

1362
01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:43.931
<v Speaker 4>winter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The military rulers of Germany address </v>

1363
01:26:43.931 --> 01:26:47.021
<v Speaker 4>themselves to a new situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The collapse of Russia had enabled them </v>

1364
01:26:47.021 --> 01:26:51.041
<v Speaker 4>to transport a million men and 3000 guns</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the eastern to the western front </v>

1365
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:53.510
<v Speaker 4>for the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Therefore,</v>

1366
01:26:53.511 --> 01:26:58.511
<v Speaker 4>since the invasion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they found themselves possessed of a </v>

1367
01:26:58.511 --> 01:26:59.480
<v Speaker 4>definite superiority over the allies in </v>
<v Speaker 4>France,</v>

1368
01:26:59.750 --> 01:27:04.750
<v Speaker 4>but the superiority was fleeting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The United States had declared war and </v>

1369
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:05.780
<v Speaker 4>was arming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but had not yet arrived.</v>

1370
01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:09.410
<v Speaker 4>Once the great masses of American </v>
<v Speaker 4>manhood could be trained,</v>

1371
01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:11.090
<v Speaker 4>equipped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>transported,</v>

1372
01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:16.180
<v Speaker 4>and brought into the line of battle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the numerical advantage Germany had </v>

1373
01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:18.830
<v Speaker 4>gained from the destruction of Russia </v>
<v Speaker 4>would be more than counterbalanced.</v>

1374
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:21.650
<v Speaker 4>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the German main headquarters,</v>

1375
01:27:21.651 --> 01:27:26.651
<v Speaker 4>new the grave losses the British army </v>
<v Speaker 4>had suffered at Passchendaele and felt </v>

1376
01:27:26.651 --> 01:27:30.761
<v Speaker 4>themselves entitled to count upon a </v>
<v Speaker 4>marked decline in its strength and </v>

1377
01:27:30.761 --> 01:27:31.700
<v Speaker 4>fighting quality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lastly,</v>

1378
01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:36.820
<v Speaker 4>the amazing character of the German </v>
<v Speaker 4>Austrian victory over the Italians at </v>

1379
01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:39.970
<v Speaker 4>corporate reddough glittered temptingly </v>
<v Speaker 4>end quote.</v>

1380
01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:45.680
<v Speaker 4>He then goes on to say it would have </v>
<v Speaker 4>been a great time for the Germans to </v>

1381
01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:46.640
<v Speaker 4>open negotiations with us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead,</v>

1382
01:27:46.641 --> 01:27:47.780
<v Speaker 4>they chose to attack</v>

1383
01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.940
<v Speaker 4>and before we get to Hitler's view of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the situation,</v>

1384
01:27:51.941 --> 01:27:53.560
<v Speaker 4>it's worth asking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1385
01:27:53.561 --> 01:27:57.610
<v Speaker 4>what were the Germans fighting for?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did they hope to achieve?</v>

1386
01:27:57.611 --> 01:28:02.350
<v Speaker 4>What was the best case scenario in any </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of end to the war?</v>

1387
01:28:02.530 --> 01:28:07.530
<v Speaker 4>And this is another difference between </v>
<v Speaker 4>the first and the second world wars in </v>

1388
01:28:07.530 --> 01:28:10.801
<v Speaker 4>the Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As soon as the Americans had said that </v>

1389
01:28:10.801 --> 01:28:14.100
<v Speaker 4>unconditional surrender,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was supposed to be the victory </v>

1390
01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:15.190
<v Speaker 4>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it made the war.</v>

1391
01:28:15.191 --> 01:28:20.191
<v Speaker 4>One of those conflicts where you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to get what's called a </v>

1392
01:28:20.191 --> 01:28:20.191
<v Speaker 4>carthaginian piece,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1393
01:28:20.191 --> 01:28:25.051
<v Speaker 4>reminiscent of how the Romans in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>third punic wars treated the city of </v>

1394
01:28:25.051 --> 01:28:26.620
<v Speaker 4>Carthage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>total destruction,</v>

1395
01:28:26.710 --> 01:28:28.330
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The total occupation,</v>

1396
01:28:28.510 --> 01:28:33.510
<v Speaker 4>total submission and domination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unconditional surrender are the piece </v>

1397
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:37.651
<v Speaker 4>turns and the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like so much of the stuff that went on </v>

1398
01:28:37.651 --> 01:28:41.731
<v Speaker 4>during this time period,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the surrender was going to everyone </v>

1399
01:28:41.731 --> 01:28:42.980
<v Speaker 4>presumed going to be some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>negotiated a.</v>

1400
01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:48.160
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be a bargaining session </v>
<v Speaker 4>and both sides are fighting to be the </v>

1401
01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:50.380
<v Speaker 4>superior person at the bargaining table,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1402
01:28:50.381 --> 01:28:55.381
<v Speaker 4>The one who can insist on better terms </v>
<v Speaker 4>as general Ludendorff,</v>

1403
01:28:55.621 --> 01:29:00.621
<v Speaker 4>the German military leader points out </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're fighting for and why they </v>

1404
01:29:00.621 --> 01:29:01.530
<v Speaker 4>have to keep attacking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He quote,</v>

1405
01:29:02.610 --> 01:29:06.120
<v Speaker 4>Germany could only make the enemy </v>
<v Speaker 4>inclined to piece by fighting.</v>

1406
01:29:06.570 --> 01:29:11.000
<v Speaker 4>It was first of all necessary to shake </v>
<v Speaker 4>the position of Lloyd George and Clemen,</v>

1407
01:29:11.001 --> 01:29:14.160
<v Speaker 4>so by a military victory before that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>

1408
01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:15.720
<v Speaker 4>Piece was not to be thought of.</v>

1409
01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:17.020
<v Speaker 5>End Quote.</v>

1410
01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:23.420
<v Speaker 4>Now let's remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What ludendorff means is that he needs </v>

1411
01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:24.900
<v Speaker 4>this military victory to get the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>peace he wants.</v>

1412
01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:26.640
<v Speaker 4>Write a piece that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1413
01:29:26.641 --> 01:29:31.290
<v Speaker 4>gives Germany either director or de </v>
<v Speaker 4>facto control of places like Belgium for</v>

1414
01:29:31.291 --> 01:29:36.291
<v Speaker 4>example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's his bargaining position in any </v>

1415
01:29:36.291 --> 01:29:37.440
<v Speaker 4>sort of agreement that ends the war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they're fighting for and the</v>

1416
01:29:37.441 --> 01:29:42.441
<v Speaker 4>other side is too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although more and more one of the </v>

1417
01:29:42.441 --> 01:29:45.261
<v Speaker 4>conditions that the Americans and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>British and the French are insisting on </v>

1418
01:29:45.261 --> 01:29:46.560
<v Speaker 4>is that the German form of government </v>
<v Speaker 4>has to change.</v>

1419
01:29:46.650 --> 01:29:51.650
<v Speaker 4>They can't be a monarchy anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that may leave Germany still alive,</v>

1420
01:29:51.991 --> 01:29:56.991
<v Speaker 4>but it means if you are the emperor of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germany or any of these high ranking </v>

1421
01:29:56.991 --> 01:29:57.870
<v Speaker 4>people that are a part of the German </v>
<v Speaker 4>monarchy,</v>

1422
01:29:58.350 --> 01:30:00.990
<v Speaker 4>it might as well be total war against </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1423
01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:04.080
<v Speaker 4>Germany may live on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're not going to be a part of it.</v>

1424
01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:08.430
<v Speaker 4>Out of Hitler is a soldier in the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>world war,</v>

1425
01:30:08.431 --> 01:30:11.730
<v Speaker 4>as we had mentioned earlier in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mine Comp,</v>

1426
01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:16.760
<v Speaker 4>which is written for this German veteran</v>
<v Speaker 4>audience and postwar audience that we </v>

1427
01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:20.751
<v Speaker 4>mentioned a little earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He talks about the sculptures and the </v>

1428
01:30:20.751 --> 01:30:24.441
<v Speaker 4>sugars and all these people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning to sort of stab the German </v>

1429
01:30:24.751 --> 01:30:27.120
<v Speaker 4>army in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>From the home front,</v>

1430
01:30:27.150 --> 01:30:29.660
<v Speaker 4>that's the way it's portrayed and when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you read lewd doors,</v>

1431
01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:32.730
<v Speaker 4>a memoirs to written during a similar </v>
<v Speaker 4>time period,</v>

1432
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:37.910
<v Speaker 4>he has the same thing going where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know the reason that the German troops </v>

1433
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:42.321
<v Speaker 4>are in danger is not because the enemy </v>
<v Speaker 4>will hurt them because they're sort of </v>

1434
01:30:42.321 --> 01:30:46.161
<v Speaker 4>this victorious entity on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>battlefield and it's because the home </v>

1435
01:30:46.161 --> 01:30:46.161
<v Speaker 4>front,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll let them down.</v>

1436
01:30:46.410 --> 01:30:51.410
<v Speaker 4>And before you know Hitler's sums up the</v>
<v Speaker 4>situation that we're facing right here </v>

1437
01:30:51.410 --> 01:30:55.221
<v Speaker 4>at the beginning of 1918,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes off on some strikes that are </v>

1438
01:30:55.221 --> 01:30:57.630
<v Speaker 4>taking place during this time period in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germany.</v>

1439
01:30:58.170 --> 01:31:01.050
<v Speaker 4>There's a naval strike that happens in </v>
<v Speaker 4>1917.</v>

1440
01:31:01.170 --> 01:31:06.170
<v Speaker 4>That's disconcerting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then several hundred thousand </v>

1441
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:09.510
<v Speaker 4>munitions workers go on strike right at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the beginning of the new year in 1918.</v>

1442
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:11.280
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

1443
01:31:11.281 --> 01:31:14.100
<v Speaker 4>when the German government punishes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ringleaders of the strikes,</v>

1444
01:31:14.101 --> 01:31:16.110
<v Speaker 4>they send them to the front as </v>
<v Speaker 4>punishment,</v>

1445
01:31:16.111 --> 01:31:21.111
<v Speaker 4>but that means that they're infiltrating</v>
<v Speaker 4>now these military units and they're </v>

1446
01:31:21.111 --> 01:31:24.621
<v Speaker 4>infiltrating them with these ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Luton Dorff and Hitler Tie right to </v>

1447
01:31:24.931 --> 01:31:27.330
<v Speaker 4>Bolshevism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Hitler ties Bolshevism by the way,</v>

1448
01:31:27.331 --> 01:31:27.960
<v Speaker 4>the Jews.</v>

1449
01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:34.160
<v Speaker 4>So right there you begin to see the </v>
<v Speaker 4>origins of the stab in the back theory,</v>

1450
01:31:34.161 --> 01:31:36.890
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and here's the way Hitler in his,</v>

1451
01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:38.360
<v Speaker 4>in his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1452
01:31:38.361 --> 01:31:40.190
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bestselling book,</v>

1453
01:31:40.191 --> 01:31:44.830
<v Speaker 4>Mine comp describes the situation the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germans found themselves in after they'd</v>

1454
01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:47.120
<v Speaker 4>given the Italians the bloody nose at </v>
<v Speaker 4>corporate rental,</v>

1455
01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:52.240
<v Speaker 4>after they've knocked all these other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people out of the war and after finding </v>

1456
01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:52.240
<v Speaker 4>out you know that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>attack</v>

<v Speaker 5>quote</v>

1458
01:31:55.110 --> 01:32:00.110
<v Speaker 4>toward the end of 1917,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the low point of the army's seems to </v>

1459
01:32:00.110 --> 01:32:02.950
<v Speaker 4>have passed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole army took fresh hope and fresh</v>

1460
01:32:02.951 --> 01:32:04.690
<v Speaker 4>courage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After the Russian collapse,</v>

1461
01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:10.020
<v Speaker 4>the conviction that the war would end </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the victory of Germany after all </v>

1462
01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:12.160
<v Speaker 4>began to seize the troops more and more </v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1463
01:32:12.161 --> 01:32:16.870
<v Speaker 4>singing could be heard and the calamity </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jane's became rarer again,</v>

1464
01:32:16.871 --> 01:32:20.530
<v Speaker 4>people believed in the future of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>father land and the quote,</v>

1465
01:32:21.630 --> 01:32:26.630
<v Speaker 4>the calamity Jane are these sculptures </v>
<v Speaker 4>and shirkers and people who say anti </v>

1466
01:32:26.630 --> 01:32:29.760
<v Speaker 4>patriotic things or or negative things </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the war effort.</v>

1467
01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:30.870
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

1468
01:32:31.230 --> 01:32:33.900
<v Speaker 4>especially the Italian collapse of </v>
<v Speaker 4>autumn,</v>

1469
01:32:33.901 --> 01:32:38.280
<v Speaker 4>1917 had had the most wonderful effect </v>
<v Speaker 4>in this victory.</v>

1470
01:32:38.370 --> 01:32:43.370
<v Speaker 4>We saw proof of the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 4>breaking through the front even aside </v>

1471
01:32:43.370 --> 01:32:47.541
<v Speaker 4>from the Russian theater of war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a glorious faith float again into the </v>

1472
01:32:47.541 --> 01:32:49.830
<v Speaker 4>hearts of the millions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enabled them to await spring 19,</v>

1473
01:32:49.831 --> 01:32:54.831
<v Speaker 4>18 with relief and confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The photo was visibly depressed in this </v>

1474
01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:57.780
<v Speaker 4>winter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He remained quieter than usual.</v>

1475
01:32:57.930 --> 01:33:01.050
<v Speaker 4>This was the lull before the storm and </v>
<v Speaker 4>quote</v>

1476
01:33:02.630 --> 01:33:07.630
<v Speaker 4>than Hitler sums up his view of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment and what the allies were facing </v>

1477
01:33:08.121 --> 01:33:10.550
<v Speaker 4>now with a sort of Germany unleashed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

1478
01:33:10.551 --> 01:33:15.551
<v Speaker 4>quote in the winter of 1917 to 1918,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dark clouds appeared for the first time </v>

1479
01:33:16.701 --> 01:33:20.040
<v Speaker 4>in the firmament of the allied world for</v>
<v Speaker 4>nearly four years.</v>

1480
01:33:20.041 --> 01:33:22.220
<v Speaker 4>They had been assailing the German </v>
<v Speaker 4>warrior,</v>

1481
01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:25.670
<v Speaker 4>and had been unable to encompass his </v>
<v Speaker 4>downfall and all this.</v>

1482
01:33:25.671 --> 01:33:28.910
<v Speaker 4>While the German had only his shield arm</v>
<v Speaker 4>free for defense.</v>

1483
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:32.570
<v Speaker 4>While the sword was obliged to strike </v>
<v Speaker 4>now in the east,</v>

1484
01:33:32.630 --> 01:33:34.850
<v Speaker 4>now in the south,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now at last,</v>

1485
01:33:34.851 --> 01:33:39.851
<v Speaker 4>the giants back was free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Streams of blood had flown before he </v>

1486
01:33:39.851 --> 01:33:41.330
<v Speaker 4>administered final defeat to one of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>foes.</v>

1487
01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:46.570
<v Speaker 4>Now in the West.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He Shield was going to be joined by his </v>

1488
01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:46.570
<v Speaker 4>sword.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Up until then,</v>

1489
01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:51.221
<v Speaker 4>the enemy had been unable to break his </v>
<v Speaker 4>defense and now he himself was facing </v>

1490
01:33:51.221 --> 01:33:55.781
<v Speaker 4>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The enemy feared him and trembled for </v>

1491
01:33:55.781 --> 01:33:56.480
<v Speaker 4>their victory and the quote</v>

1492
01:33:58.180 --> 01:33:59.080
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in one sense,</v>

1493
01:33:59.081 --> 01:34:04.081
<v Speaker 4>this is a post first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hitler putting a rosy picture on this </v>

1494
01:34:04.081 --> 01:34:04.450
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1495
01:34:04.451 --> 01:34:08.680
<v Speaker 4>with peer we were going to defeat them </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then stabbed in the back by the Jews</v>

1496
01:34:08.681 --> 01:34:09.610
<v Speaker 4>and Bolsheviks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1497
01:34:09.970 --> 01:34:14.970
<v Speaker 4>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some truth to a couple of these </v>

1498
01:34:14.970 --> 01:34:14.970
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

1499
01:34:14.970 --> 01:34:19.920
<v Speaker 4>the Bolsheviks were having an influence </v>
<v Speaker 4>on Germany and that attempt by Ludin </v>

1500
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:23.130
<v Speaker 4>Dorf to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1501
01:34:23.131 --> 01:34:28.131
<v Speaker 4>get rid of his next door neighbor in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>apartment complex by burning his </v>

1502
01:34:28.131 --> 01:34:31.000
<v Speaker 4>apartment down is beginning to change </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germany a little bit in Luton.</v>

1503
01:34:31.001 --> 01:34:33.280
<v Speaker 4>Dorf writes about this in his memoirs in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a way,</v>

1504
01:34:33.370 --> 01:34:36.490
<v Speaker 4>remember writing years later so we can </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretend to have hindsight.</v>

1505
01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:39.880
<v Speaker 4>He basically acts like he understood the</v>
<v Speaker 4>risk was dangerous.</v>

1506
01:34:39.970 --> 01:34:44.380
<v Speaker 4>He thought they could contain the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bolshevik intellectual contagion,</v>

1507
01:34:44.381 --> 01:34:49.381
<v Speaker 4>but he knew that there was a chance it </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't work out that way and there's </v>

1508
01:34:49.381 --> 01:34:53.161
<v Speaker 4>something to that in terms of why the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germans were all of a sudden beginning </v>

1509
01:34:53.161 --> 01:34:57.451
<v Speaker 4>to start to show real cracks in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>facade of the home front and some of </v>

1510
01:34:59.701 --> 01:35:01.470
<v Speaker 4>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it should be pointed out that a guy like</v>

1511
01:35:01.471 --> 01:35:03.360
<v Speaker 4>Luton door for Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things are Bolsheviks,</v>

1512
01:35:03.810 --> 01:35:06.720
<v Speaker 4>are probably more like Social Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1513
01:35:06.721 --> 01:35:09.960
<v Speaker 4>mild socialists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to a guy like lewd Neidorf,</v>

1514
01:35:09.961 --> 01:35:14.961
<v Speaker 4>anyone who's thinking that the war might</v>
<v Speaker 4>have gone on too long or that Germany </v>

1515
01:35:14.961 --> 01:35:19.371
<v Speaker 4>instead of an emperor might do better </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a representative democracy or a </v>

1516
01:35:19.371 --> 01:35:21.300
<v Speaker 4>republic or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That to them is traitorous and radical,</v>

1517
01:35:21.301 --> 01:35:23.250
<v Speaker 4>so you might as well be a Bolshevik</v>

1518
01:35:24.670 --> 01:35:29.670
<v Speaker 4>nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about what these people are going </v>

1519
01:35:29.670 --> 01:35:29.670
<v Speaker 4>through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Four years of war.</v>

1520
01:35:29.670 --> 01:35:33.180
<v Speaker 4>All these countries in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrificing their future with each </v>

1521
01:35:33.180 --> 01:35:37.231
<v Speaker 4>generation of youngsters that they call </v>
<v Speaker 4>up and throw into the mall and they're </v>

1522
01:35:37.231 --> 01:35:41.611
<v Speaker 4>sacrificing their past to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're cannibalizing their country's </v>

1523
01:35:41.860 --> 01:35:44.110
<v Speaker 4>historical in longterm assets.</v>

1524
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:48.750
<v Speaker 4>We've quoted the English wife of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>German nobleman princess blue shirt.</v>

1525
01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.790
<v Speaker 4>Evelyn Belushi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>writing in her diary,</v>

1526
01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:54.210
<v Speaker 4>she told this story that is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>heartbreaking about,</v>

1527
01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:59.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that the Germans don't have </v>

1528
01:35:59.420 --> 01:36:00.771
<v Speaker 4>enough ammunition anymore and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>starting to go into the society and and </v>

1529
01:36:00.771 --> 01:36:04.641
<v Speaker 4>take things to meltdown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One historian I read said that during </v>

1530
01:36:04.641 --> 01:36:09.171
<v Speaker 4>this period more than 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>church bells were melted down and </v>

1531
01:36:09.171 --> 01:36:10.770
<v Speaker 4>princess blueshift tells a story about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1532
01:36:10.890 --> 01:36:11.910
<v Speaker 4>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

1533
01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:17.540
<v Speaker 4>there are other signs too pathetic in </v>
<v Speaker 4>their way of the increasing scarcity of </v>

1534
01:36:17.551 --> 01:36:22.380
<v Speaker 4>metal for everywhere the old church </v>
<v Speaker 4>bells and even the organ pipes are being</v>

1535
01:36:22.381 --> 01:36:25.470
<v Speaker 4>dragged from the churches and turned </v>
<v Speaker 4>into ammunition.</v>

1536
01:36:25.710 --> 01:36:26.250
<v Speaker 4>Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1537
01:36:26.251 --> 01:36:29.130
<v Speaker 4>into the scarcity of oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sanctuary lamp,</v>

1538
01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:34.220
<v Speaker 4>such a dear familiar sight in Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 4>churches may no longer shed it's tender </v>

1539
01:36:34.220 --> 01:36:36.990
<v Speaker 4>light before the tabernacle in a small </v>
<v Speaker 4>town near here.</v>

1540
01:36:37.170 --> 01:36:39.810
<v Speaker 4>A sad little ceremony took place the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other day.</v>

1541
01:36:40.050 --> 01:36:45.050
<v Speaker 4>The Ancient Church Bell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which had rung the people from the </v>

1542
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:48.141
<v Speaker 4>cradle to the grave for 300 years and </v>
<v Speaker 4>more was requisitioned by the military </v>

1543
01:36:48.141 --> 01:36:51.420
<v Speaker 4>authorities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The grief felt by the inhabitants was so</v>

1544
01:36:51.421 --> 01:36:56.421
<v Speaker 4>great that they determined to do their </v>
<v Speaker 4>ancient friend all the honor they could </v>

1545
01:36:56.421 --> 01:36:59.010
<v Speaker 4>and after having performed the regular </v>
<v Speaker 4>funeral service for the debt over it,</v>

1546
01:36:59.250 --> 01:37:04.250
<v Speaker 4>a procession was formed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>headed by the priest in his vestments </v>

1547
01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:08.360
<v Speaker 4>and his acolytes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>swinging their incense and the </v>

1548
01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:10.821
<v Speaker 4>inhabitants following the bell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was covered with wreaths and </v>

1549
01:37:10.821 --> 01:37:14.361
<v Speaker 4>flowers and hand it over to the military</v>
<v Speaker 4>authorities under tiers and </v>

1550
01:37:14.361 --> 01:37:18.231
<v Speaker 4>protestations and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I look at that story is kind of symbolic</v>

1551
01:37:19.281 --> 01:37:24.281
<v Speaker 4>of you know the greatness of old Europe </v>
<v Speaker 4>at the height and the high water marks </v>

1552
01:37:24.281 --> 01:37:28.621
<v Speaker 4>if its wealth and civilization and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds of years of glorious past </v>

1553
01:37:29.721 --> 01:37:34.721
<v Speaker 4>behind them sort of girding the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>society being ripped apart and thrown </v>

1554
01:37:36.231 --> 01:37:41.231
<v Speaker 4>into the mall and the furnace to provide</v>
<v Speaker 4>the implements that are needed to fight </v>

1555
01:37:41.231 --> 01:37:45.860
<v Speaker 4>the war that is destroying its high </v>
<v Speaker 4>place on the world stage.</v>

1556
01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:51.380
<v Speaker 4>This is a sort of tragic irony that </v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't confined to Germany.</v>

1557
01:37:51.381 --> 01:37:56.381
<v Speaker 4>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is how Britain and France and </v>

1558
01:37:56.381 --> 01:37:56.381
<v Speaker 4>Russia and all these old line powers </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of.</v>

1559
01:37:56.381 --> 01:37:58.890
<v Speaker 4>They're trapped in this conflict now </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is chewing up their wealth,</v>

1560
01:37:59.610 --> 01:38:02.340
<v Speaker 4>destabilizing the structures of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>society,</v>

1561
01:38:02.341 --> 01:38:07.341
<v Speaker 4>and once again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking the next class of draftees who </v>

1562
01:38:07.341 --> 01:38:10.791
<v Speaker 4>reach now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>18 years old and throwing them into the </v>

1563
01:38:10.791 --> 01:38:14.661
<v Speaker 4>meat grinder to think of the pressure on</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people who are commanding all </v>

1564
01:38:14.661 --> 01:38:16.620
<v Speaker 4>these armies on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on both sides.</v>

1565
01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:22.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean Ludin door if you can't help but </v>
<v Speaker 4>think about this guy because he's the </v>

1566
01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:23.820
<v Speaker 4>one who gets to decide how you play </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germany's last card,</v>

1567
01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:25.560
<v Speaker 4>the central powers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>last card.</v>

1568
01:38:25.561 --> 01:38:30.561
<v Speaker 4>Think of the people that are counting on</v>
<v Speaker 4>him from a completely human experiment.</v>

1569
01:38:30.931 --> 01:38:35.931
<v Speaker 4>Imagine the stress and responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 4>that falls on this one guy shoulders </v>

1570
01:38:36.301 --> 01:38:41.301
<v Speaker 4>more than anyone else on that side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously he's got help and staffs and </v>

1571
01:38:41.301 --> 01:38:41.730
<v Speaker 4>you know other people to consultant what</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you,</v>

1572
01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:46.080
<v Speaker 4>but basically the number one person's </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility is his.</v>

1573
01:38:47.730 --> 01:38:52.730
<v Speaker 4>He's got to plan the biggest battle in </v>
<v Speaker 4>world history and the stakes are </v>

1574
01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:57.760
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1575
01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:03.330
<v Speaker 4>This is the biggest encounter between,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1576
01:39:03.331 --> 01:39:08.331
<v Speaker 4>the cutting edge militaries of the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>that has ever happened and that's what </v>

1577
01:39:08.331 --> 01:39:11.751
<v Speaker 4>Ludendorff is planning and it's an </v>
<v Speaker 4>immensely complicated affair with with </v>

1578
01:39:11.751 --> 01:39:12.720
<v Speaker 4>details beyond belief</v>

1579
01:39:14.190 --> 01:39:19.190
<v Speaker 4>mean Luton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dorf will start moving troops from the </v>

1580
01:39:19.190 --> 01:39:23.331
<v Speaker 4>eastern front who had been fighting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Russians on trains all the way over to </v>

1581
01:39:23.331 --> 01:39:24.540
<v Speaker 4>the west before the Russians even sign a</v>
<v Speaker 4>peace treaty.</v>

1582
01:39:25.410 --> 01:39:28.590
<v Speaker 4>By the spring of 1918,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's moved a million German soldiers who</v>

1583
01:39:28.591 --> 01:39:33.591
<v Speaker 4>had been fighting the Russians over to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the West where they can now be used </v>

1584
01:39:33.591 --> 01:39:35.100
<v Speaker 4>against the French and the British,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the German army in the West.</v>

1585
01:39:35.101 --> 01:39:40.101
<v Speaker 4>Numbers over 3 million soldiers by </v>
<v Speaker 4>spring 1918 and Luton Dorf has a plan </v>

1586
01:39:41.761 --> 01:39:43.170
<v Speaker 4>that he's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1587
01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:48.200
<v Speaker 4>put into place that that involves </v>
<v Speaker 4>throwing multiple punches at the French </v>

1588
01:39:48.331 --> 01:39:53.331
<v Speaker 4>and the British like a five punch </v>
<v Speaker 4>combination and he's going to use about </v>

1589
01:39:53.331 --> 01:39:57.500
<v Speaker 4>a million soldiers to form the fist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael named after St Michael is the </v>

1590
01:39:58.621 --> 01:40:03.621
<v Speaker 4>first of these punches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the entire affair will sometimes be </v>

1591
01:40:03.621 --> 01:40:07.191
<v Speaker 4>called the 1918 spring offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The German soldiers referred to it.</v>

1592
01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:10.710
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it's just a great battle in </v>
<v Speaker 4>France that shows you how big it's going</v>

1593
01:40:10.711 --> 01:40:12.330
<v Speaker 4>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One part of it,</v>

1594
01:40:12.350 --> 01:40:14.550
<v Speaker 4>sometimes referred to as the peace </v>
<v Speaker 4>offensive,</v>

1595
01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:18.630
<v Speaker 4>and sometimes the entire affair is </v>
<v Speaker 4>called the Kaiser Schlock.</v>

1596
01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:24.280
<v Speaker 4>The emperor's battle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Historians have been fascinated by these</v>

1597
01:40:24.281 --> 01:40:27.790
<v Speaker 4>series of battles ever since for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of major reasons.</v>

1598
01:40:29.020 --> 01:40:32.410
<v Speaker 4>One is the scope and the other other </v>
<v Speaker 4>stakes.</v>

1599
01:40:33.670 --> 01:40:35.920
<v Speaker 4>This is the largest battle the world's </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever seen.</v>

1600
01:40:35.921 --> 01:40:40.921
<v Speaker 4>The complexity is unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's very hard battle to follow </v>

1601
01:40:40.921 --> 01:40:44.440
<v Speaker 4>or explain or talk about it in the front</v>
<v Speaker 4>will be miles long.</v>

1602
01:40:44.441 --> 01:40:49.441
<v Speaker 4>It will involve millions of men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The complexity in terms of trying to </v>

1603
01:40:50.471 --> 01:40:54.160
<v Speaker 4>plan and arrange and get ready for one</v>

1604
01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:57.070
<v Speaker 1>of these big offensives in five or six </v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

1605
01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:02.100
<v Speaker 1>which is your planning window is perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most complex task human beings have </v>

1606
01:41:03.461 --> 01:41:08.461
<v Speaker 1>ever attempted to tackle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you could say that there are </v>

1607
01:41:08.461 --> 01:41:11.290
<v Speaker 1>bigger things like trying to create a </v>
<v Speaker 1>global society,</v>

1608
01:41:11.291 --> 01:41:12.640
<v Speaker 1>which we're in the process of doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

1609
01:41:12.641 --> 01:41:17.641
<v Speaker 1>That's very hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can do that over time and build </v>

1610
01:41:17.641 --> 01:41:19.690
<v Speaker 1>on the achievements of previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations and sort of evolve towards a</v>

1611
01:41:19.691 --> 01:41:23.410
<v Speaker 1>solution to a complex problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people have a time window and it's</v>

1612
01:41:23.411 --> 01:41:28.411
<v Speaker 1>short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the Kaiser schlock done within five </v>

1613
01:41:28.411 --> 01:41:31.921
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom's got to be ready on the 21st of </v>

1614
01:41:31.921 --> 01:41:31.921
<v Speaker 1>March.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

1615
01:41:31.921 --> 01:41:34.231
<v Speaker 1>Get it done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just the attempts to keep the </v>

1616
01:41:34.231 --> 01:41:37.780
<v Speaker 1>allies in the dark about where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming are complex as heck.</v>

1617
01:41:38.290 --> 01:41:43.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will move troops and equipment at </v>

1618
01:41:43.290 --> 01:41:45.031
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will cover up the artillery gun </v>

1619
01:41:45.031 --> 01:41:45.610
<v Speaker 1>wheels with cloth so you can't hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1620
01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:49.280
<v Speaker 1>They will roused out the civilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>population and all these towns and March</v>

1621
01:41:49.281 --> 01:41:51.130
<v Speaker 1>them around in all directions to </v>
<v Speaker 1>confuse,</v>

1622
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:52.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allied observers,</v>

1623
01:41:54.510 --> 01:41:58.590
<v Speaker 1>they will scramble and use false radio </v>
<v Speaker 1>messages and just because you know,</v>

1624
01:41:58.591 --> 01:42:02.160
<v Speaker 1>this is sort of a transition period in </v>
<v Speaker 1>history just to cover all their bases.</v>

1625
01:42:02.161 --> 01:42:04.470
<v Speaker 1>They will also pull out the carrier </v>
<v Speaker 1>pigeons,</v>

1626
01:42:04.710 --> 01:42:08.730
<v Speaker 1>including carrier pigeons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>captured from the other side,</v>

1627
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:11.550
<v Speaker 1>put false notes in the little </v>
<v Speaker 1>compartment,</v>

1628
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:14.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their leg and send them off.</v>

1629
01:42:15.150 --> 01:42:17.010
<v Speaker 1>That's called covering all your bases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1630
01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:21.150
<v Speaker 1>But think of the planning and complexity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the work that goes on.</v>

1631
01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:26.130
<v Speaker 1>The other fascinating aspect to </v>
<v Speaker 1>historians are the stakes.</v>

1632
01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:31.470
<v Speaker 1>When do you have stakes like this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest war and human history,</v>

1633
01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:36.800
<v Speaker 1>and as one historian put it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ludina door from the Germans have six </v>

1634
01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:37.680
<v Speaker 1>months to change the course of the war </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

1635
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:43.070
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the numerical advantage the Americans </v>

1636
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:46.131
<v Speaker 1>will provide will be overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have this window of opportunity </v>

1637
01:42:46.131 --> 01:42:50.330
<v Speaker 1>and it's an all or nothing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My southern historians have argued that </v>

1638
01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:51.150
<v Speaker 1>the Germans should have just gone on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive here,</v>

1639
01:42:51.151 --> 01:42:56.151
<v Speaker 1>dug in and made the allied forces fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>until 1920 or 1921,</v>

1640
01:42:58.420 --> 01:43:03.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the mounting losses would force </v>

1641
01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:03.420
<v Speaker 1>them into some sort of a favorable </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece.</v>

1642
01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:05.940
<v Speaker 1>But that kind of ignores how bad things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are on the home front,</v>

1643
01:43:05.941 --> 01:43:10.941
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if the German army can withstand </v>

1644
01:43:10.941 --> 01:43:11.400
<v Speaker 1>these allied attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to lose the people back at</v>

1645
01:43:11.430 --> 01:43:14.730
<v Speaker 1>home for a year past the infamous turnip</v>
<v Speaker 1>winter.</v>

1646
01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:17.190
<v Speaker 1>What happens when the turnip winter is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good old days,</v>

1647
01:43:17.191 --> 01:43:19.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pollutant or from the Germans.</v>

1648
01:43:19.861 --> 01:43:22.830
<v Speaker 1>Don't just put this attack together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're excited about it.</v>

1649
01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:26.670
<v Speaker 1>The German troops are almost ecstatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The morale is sky high.</v>

1650
01:43:26.671 --> 01:43:30.570
<v Speaker 1>They want a chance to win the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why this first punch operation,</v>

1651
01:43:30.571 --> 01:43:35.571
<v Speaker 1>Michael,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so important because this is the </v>

1652
01:43:35.571 --> 01:43:35.571
<v Speaker 1>punch where all the optimism is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

1653
01:43:35.571 --> 01:43:37.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's drinking the Koolaid.</v>

1654
01:43:38.250 --> 01:43:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Luton Dorf decides to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know up his gamble ante a little bit</v>

1655
01:43:42.451 --> 01:43:47.451
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only is he gambling with this </v>

1656
01:43:47.451 --> 01:43:47.451
<v Speaker 1>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's going to,</v>

1657
01:43:47.451 --> 01:43:50.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially pull out the rocket fuel </v>

1658
01:43:50.970 --> 01:43:53.930
<v Speaker 1>from the great mass of he goes through </v>
<v Speaker 1>and calms his army for the best man,</v>

1659
01:43:54.321 --> 01:43:59.321
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The healthiest and strongest that ones </v>

1660
01:43:59.321 --> 01:43:59.321
<v Speaker 1>are the highest morale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The veterans who weren't cynical yet,</v>

1661
01:43:59.480 --> 01:44:04.480
<v Speaker 1>all these people who are better than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the herd and pulls them out and </v>

1662
01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:06.560
<v Speaker 1>puts them into special units and gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>them the best weapons.</v>

1663
01:44:06.561 --> 01:44:11.561
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled away from the great mass of </v>

1664
01:44:11.561 --> 01:44:12.080
<v Speaker 1>people and the special training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they called special training.</v>

1665
01:44:12.081 --> 01:44:17.081
<v Speaker 1>In the first world war today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would call standard training in a </v>

1666
01:44:17.081 --> 01:44:18.200
<v Speaker 1>modern military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They called them storm trooper tactics.</v>

1667
01:44:18.201 --> 01:44:23.201
<v Speaker 1>We call them fire and move tactics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and every army in the world uses them </v>

1668
01:44:23.201 --> 01:44:24.740
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

1669
01:44:24.741 --> 01:44:28.520
<v Speaker 1>what Ludendorff has done here is create </v>
<v Speaker 1>an initial advantage,</v>

1670
01:44:28.770 --> 01:44:33.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for himself because his best troops are </v>

1671
01:44:33.770 --> 01:44:36.401
<v Speaker 1>going to go up against the great mass of</v>
<v Speaker 1>French and British troops that they run </v>

1672
01:44:36.401 --> 01:44:36.401
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

1673
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:41.170
<v Speaker 1>They will give out the lion's share of </v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties to the French and the British</v>

1674
01:44:41.171 --> 01:44:43.810
<v Speaker 1>and the allies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they will also take the lion's share</v>

1675
01:44:43.811 --> 01:44:48.280
<v Speaker 1>of casualties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a gamble because when Ludin Dorf</v>

1676
01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:53.320
<v Speaker 1>uses these best troops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to use them up and if they </v>

1677
01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:57.001
<v Speaker 1>haven't won by that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be left with the not best </v>

1678
01:44:57.001 --> 01:45:01.470
<v Speaker 1>troops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leftovers people who've had their </v>

1679
01:45:01.470 --> 01:45:02.970
<v Speaker 1>best weapons stripped from them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>given to the other guys.</v>

1680
01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:05.140
<v Speaker 1>People who haven't been trained in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>latest tactics,</v>

1681
01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:09.820
<v Speaker 1>people who would expect it are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>simply move up and occupied the trenches</v>

1682
01:45:09.821 --> 01:45:14.620
<v Speaker 1>that have already been conquered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a Campbell and on March 21st.</v>

1683
01:45:14.920 --> 01:45:19.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not a gamble Ludina and has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about because he's got all these </v>

1684
01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:21.630
<v Speaker 1>storm trooper and assault units.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1685
01:45:21.631 --> 01:45:26.631
<v Speaker 1>waiting for the moment to jump off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>synchronizing their watches and waiting </v>

1686
01:45:27.341 --> 01:45:32.341
<v Speaker 1>for what will be the largest cannonade </v>
<v Speaker 1>in history to kickoff on March 21st </v>

1687
01:45:35.111 --> 01:45:40.111
<v Speaker 1>operation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael begins the first punch of the </v>

1688
01:45:40.111 --> 01:45:42.271
<v Speaker 1>German multi punch combination aimed </v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily at the British.</v>

1689
01:45:44.110 --> 01:45:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Some 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>artillery pieces will open fire at about</v>

1690
01:45:49.541 --> 01:45:51.250
<v Speaker 1>dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere in the 4:00</v>

1691
01:45:51.251 --> 01:45:51.700
<v Speaker 1>hour</v>

1692
01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:58.000
<v Speaker 1>they will only fire only it's forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're under fire,</v>

1693
01:45:58.001 --> 01:46:03.001
<v Speaker 1>they'll only fire for about four hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what's called a hurricane </v>

1694
01:46:03.001 --> 01:46:03.640
<v Speaker 1>bombardment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very different than what the allies were</v>

1695
01:46:03.641 --> 01:46:08.641
<v Speaker 1>doing through most of the war where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>will bombard for weeks on end sometimes </v>

1696
01:46:08.641 --> 01:46:11.890
<v Speaker 1>right at the Somme in 1916.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big artillery battle,</v>

1697
01:46:11.891 --> 01:46:16.891
<v Speaker 1>they'll fire one point 7 million shells </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first week and it's famous </v>

1698
01:46:16.891 --> 01:46:17.080
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

1699
01:46:17.081 --> 01:46:22.081
<v Speaker 1>think of how many shells that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every first world war major </v>

1700
01:46:22.081 --> 01:46:22.590
<v Speaker 1>offensive outdoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earlier ones in,</v>

1701
01:46:22.591 --> 01:46:24.280
<v Speaker 1>in this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fire,</v>

1702
01:46:24.370 --> 01:46:29.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a contest like a statistic in </v>

1703
01:46:29.370 --> 01:46:29.380
<v Speaker 1>the Guinness Book of World Records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they fire one point,</v>

1704
01:46:29.381 --> 01:46:34.381
<v Speaker 1>1 million shells in four hours and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>conducted like a symphony of death.</v>

1705
01:46:36.610 --> 01:46:39.250
<v Speaker 1>The Germans had brought in all of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

1706
01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:42.700
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could call the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>stars to this battle.</v>

1707
01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:48.120
<v Speaker 1>One of them is this artillery conductor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Georg Brooke Miller,</v>

1708
01:46:48.401 --> 01:46:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I think his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his nickname is breakthrough mueller</v>

1709
01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:57.740
<v Speaker 1>and he has a whole theory and that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been perfecting on how to use these </v>

1710
01:46:57.740 --> 01:47:00.621
<v Speaker 1>artillery barrages and part of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory involves the idea that you don't </v>

1711
01:47:00.621 --> 01:47:03.510
<v Speaker 1>need to destroy the enemy positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what it's always been done.</v>

1712
01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:07.020
<v Speaker 1>All you need to do is neutralize them </v>
<v Speaker 1>all you need to do with that machine gun</v>

1713
01:47:07.021 --> 01:47:12.021
<v Speaker 1>nest to stop them from shooting long </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that the infantry doesn't get </v>

1714
01:47:12.021 --> 01:47:13.920
<v Speaker 1>killed on the way to taking out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine gun nest themselves.</v>

1715
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:19.550
<v Speaker 1>So he uses a lot more gas first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he has a whole order that all this </v>

1716
01:47:20.341 --> 01:47:21.150
<v Speaker 1>comes into me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First.</v>

1717
01:47:21.151 --> 01:47:23.490
<v Speaker 1>He shoots the gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't kill you,</v>

1718
01:47:23.491 --> 01:47:28.491
<v Speaker 1>but it's like tear gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you gag and vomit and it makes </v>

1719
01:47:28.491 --> 01:47:31.791
<v Speaker 1>you rip off your gas masks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then he hits you with the phosgene </v>

1720
01:47:31.791 --> 01:47:33.510
<v Speaker 1>gas that if you're not wearing your gas </v>
<v Speaker 1>mask kills you.</v>

1721
01:47:34.570 --> 01:47:37.860
<v Speaker 1>He'll also use mustard gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a long lasting,</v>

1722
01:47:37.861 --> 01:47:42.861
<v Speaker 1>so it's like spraying the the ant spray </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will still kill the ants a week </v>

1723
01:47:42.861 --> 01:47:43.200
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's dried up,</v>

1724
01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:48.560
<v Speaker 1>the mustard gas is shot at all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>important crossroads and areas and </v>

1725
01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:52.791
<v Speaker 1>heights and observation posts so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>either you get out or you're so covered </v>

1726
01:47:53.071 --> 01:47:58.071
<v Speaker 1>up and gas masks and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hardly function and the Germans </v>

1727
01:47:58.071 --> 01:47:58.320
<v Speaker 1>just want you to be impeded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1728
01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:03.320
<v Speaker 1>You just have to be not functioning long</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough for the waves of German soldiers </v>

1729
01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:06.000
<v Speaker 1>to be free and clear to overrun your </v>
<v Speaker 1>physicians.</v>

1730
01:48:07.020 --> 01:48:12.020
<v Speaker 1>It also has the added benefit of not </v>
<v Speaker 1>making the terrain in front of your </v>

1731
01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:15.480
<v Speaker 1>advancing troops look like the cratered </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface of the moon.</v>

1732
01:48:16.770 --> 01:48:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Large shell craters have become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>barrier all its own in previous battles.</v>

1733
01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:25.880
<v Speaker 1>In this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German artillery was going to </v>

1734
01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:27.861
<v Speaker 1>minimize that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep the way open for a quick and </v>

1735
01:48:27.861 --> 01:48:31.311
<v Speaker 1>shocking advance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The artillery opens fire on March 21st.</v>

1736
01:48:32.910 --> 01:48:37.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's strange to say that they're </v>

1737
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.910
<v Speaker 1>surprised because everyone knew this was</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming,</v>

1738
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:39.720
<v Speaker 1>but the surprises in the intensity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the locations and whatnot,</v>

1739
01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:45.350
<v Speaker 1>the Kaiser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emperor of Germany and the face of </v>

1740
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:48.801
<v Speaker 1>the German military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hindenburg or reportedly at the battle </v>

1741
01:48:48.801 --> 01:48:52.610
<v Speaker 1>and the Kaiser was known to have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>wooden tower that's sort of like a </v>

1742
01:48:52.610 --> 01:48:54.810
<v Speaker 1>ranger station erected so he could try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see a battle,</v>

1743
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:57.780
<v Speaker 1>which was something that in the 19th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century wouldn't have been that strange.</v>

1744
01:48:57.780 --> 01:49:02.780
<v Speaker 1>People came out with picnic baskets in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first major battle of the US civil </v>

1745
01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:07.131
<v Speaker 1>war to watch and the Kaiser and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hindenburg were supposedly at this </v>

1746
01:49:07.171 --> 01:49:12.171
<v Speaker 1>battle to watch it unfold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Winston Churchill was also there when </v>

1747
01:49:12.171 --> 01:49:16.041
<v Speaker 1>the cannonade opened up and you get this</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling that he's a [inaudible] figure </v>

1748
01:49:16.041 --> 01:49:18.000
<v Speaker 1>that he's just not gonna miss any big </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical event.</v>

1749
01:49:18.001 --> 01:49:23.001
<v Speaker 1>If he can avoid that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was at this battle too and he </v>

1750
01:49:23.001 --> 01:49:24.690
<v Speaker 1>gives one of the original and much </v>
<v Speaker 1>quoted accounts of what it was like.</v>

1751
01:49:24.691 --> 01:49:25.200
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1752
01:49:25.201 --> 01:49:30.201
<v Speaker 1>he was walking around and everyone was </v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for something to happen and he </v>

1753
01:49:30.201 --> 01:49:30.240
<v Speaker 1>woke up from his sleep somewhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>4:00</v>

1754
01:49:30.241 --> 01:49:35.241
<v Speaker 1>hour and who's relatively silent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then boom quote.</v>

1755
01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly after what seemed about a half </v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour,</v>

1756
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:44.040
<v Speaker 1>the silence was broken by six or seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>very loud and very heavy explosion.</v>

1757
01:49:44.041 --> 01:49:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Several miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought they were are 12 inch guns,</v>

1758
01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 1>but they were</v>

1759
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:53.040
<v Speaker 4>probably mines and then exactly as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>pianist runs his hand across the </v>

1760
01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:56.500
<v Speaker 4>keyboard from treble to base their rows </v>
<v Speaker 4>and less than one minute.</v>

1761
01:49:56.650 --> 01:50:00.550
<v Speaker 4>The most tremendous cannonade I shall </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever here and quote.</v>

1762
01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:06.960
<v Speaker 4>He said that quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the weight and intensity of the </v>

1763
01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:08.140
<v Speaker 4>bombardment surpassed anything which </v>
<v Speaker 4>anyone had ever known before,</v>

1764
01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:14.200
<v Speaker 4>and to quote Ernst Junger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the German soldier we've talked about </v>

1765
01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:16.270
<v Speaker 4>sometimes in the story is also at this </v>
<v Speaker 4>battle.</v>

1766
01:50:16.810 --> 01:50:21.810
<v Speaker 4>He's on the opposite side of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shelling rights and not even the side </v>

1767
01:50:21.810 --> 01:50:25.201
<v Speaker 4>that's being shelled and he says that it</v>
<v Speaker 4>made every other event he'd been to in </v>

1768
01:50:25.201 --> 01:50:26.320
<v Speaker 4>this war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looked like a tea party,</v>

1769
01:50:26.321 --> 01:50:28.930
<v Speaker 4>and he was at many of the big battles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1770
01:50:29.530 --> 01:50:34.530
<v Speaker 4>A tea party.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said that the shelling seemed to </v>

1771
01:50:34.530 --> 01:50:36.880
<v Speaker 4>suspend the laws of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

1772
01:50:36.881 --> 01:50:41.881
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't light a match or anything </v>

1773
01:50:41.881 --> 01:50:43.591
<v Speaker 4>because the shock waves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even as far away as the German troops </v>

1774
01:50:43.591 --> 01:50:43.591
<v Speaker 4>were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would blow it right out.</v>

1775
01:50:43.630 --> 01:50:48.630
<v Speaker 4>He says that if you looked over to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>enemy lines I'll use saw is rolling </v>

1776
01:50:48.630 --> 01:50:52.471
<v Speaker 4>clouds of flame and it looked like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way the desert looks when you look in </v>

1777
01:50:52.481 --> 01:50:55.660
<v Speaker 4>the distance and the heat is shimmering </v>
<v Speaker 4>and makes you almost see Mirages.</v>

1778
01:50:55.661 --> 01:50:57.880
<v Speaker 4>He said that that's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1779
01:50:58.030 --> 01:51:03.030
<v Speaker 4>on the side of the people being shelled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The effect on the British troops is </v>

1780
01:51:04.211 --> 01:51:09.211
<v Speaker 4>almost like being punched drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A private in the first West Yorkshire </v>

1781
01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:12.700
<v Speaker 4>Regiment who was there explained it this</v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

1782
01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:15.790
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody could stand more than three hours</v>

1783
01:51:15.791 --> 01:51:19.150
<v Speaker 4>of sustained shelling before they </v>
<v Speaker 4>started feeling sleepy and numb.</v>

1784
01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:22.660
<v Speaker 4>You're hammered after three hours and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're there for the picking.</v>

1785
01:51:22.661 --> 01:51:27.661
<v Speaker 4>When he comes over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a bit like being under an </v>

1786
01:51:27.661 --> 01:51:30.151
<v Speaker 4>anesthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't put a lot of resistance up on </v>

1787
01:51:30.151 --> 01:51:31.900
<v Speaker 4>the other fronts I'd been on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There had been so much of our resistance</v>

1788
01:51:31.901 --> 01:51:36.901
<v Speaker 4>that whenever Jerry opened up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our artillery opened up and quieted him </v>

1789
01:51:36.901 --> 01:51:37.930
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was no retaliation.</v>

1790
01:51:37.930 --> 01:51:41.530
<v Speaker 4>This time he had a free do at us and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

1791
01:51:42.670 --> 01:51:47.020
<v Speaker 4>I should point out that the Germans </v>
<v Speaker 4>called the British Tommy and the British</v>

1792
01:51:47.021 --> 01:51:50.290
<v Speaker 4>called the Germans Jerry often,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's how that happens.</v>

1793
01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:55.870
<v Speaker 4>Historian Alexander Watson quotes a </v>
<v Speaker 4>German battalion,</v>

1794
01:51:55.871 --> 01:52:00.871
<v Speaker 4>Dr Ernst determine who recorded that men</v>
<v Speaker 4>reacted to shelling quote for the most </v>

1795
01:52:01.841 --> 01:52:05.540
<v Speaker 4>part with the feeling of enormous </v>
<v Speaker 4>sleepiness and quote,</v>

1796
01:52:05.930 --> 01:52:10.930
<v Speaker 4>and then said that you get both </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotional and physical changes in men </v>

1797
01:52:10.930 --> 01:52:15.481
<v Speaker 4>who are being shelled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So think about the people on the </v>

1798

<v Speaker 4>receiving end of what's about to be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground attack after they've experienced </v>

1799
01:52:17.851 --> 01:52:19.810
<v Speaker 4>something that does this to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Witterman says,</v>

1800
01:52:19.811 --> 01:52:23.020
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the eyes pop out of their sockets.</v>

1801
01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:28.260
<v Speaker 4>The expression becomes fixed and glassy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The facial skin loses all of its red </v>

1802
01:52:28.451 --> 01:52:30.700
<v Speaker 4>color.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The skin becomes yellow,</v>

1803
01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:34.720
<v Speaker 4>the cheekbones protrude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The lifts are shut tight and sticky,</v>

01:52:34.721 --> 01:52:37.300
<v Speaker 4>spittle tax up the tongue to the roof of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mouth.</v>

1805
01:52:37.630 --> 01:52:40.300
<v Speaker 4>The heart works in short convulsive </v>
<v Speaker 4>beats.</v>

1806
01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:43.120
<v Speaker 4>Breathing becomes slower from time to </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1807
01:52:43.121 --> 01:52:45.950
<v Speaker 4>A cold shutter runs through the body and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the teeth chatter,</v>

1808
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:51.160
<v Speaker 1>every spoken word is felt as agony and </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote Watson goes to point out that </v>

1809
01:52:52.731 --> 01:52:57.731
<v Speaker 1>surveys had shown that the troops were </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly scared of artillery and </v>

1810
01:52:57.731 --> 01:52:59.830
<v Speaker 1>unsettled by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He writes,</v>

1811
01:52:59.831 --> 01:53:00.190
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

1812
01:53:01.770 --> 01:53:06.770
<v Speaker 4>not only did artillery cause more </v>
<v Speaker 4>casualties than any other weapon on the </v>

1813
01:53:06.770 --> 01:53:08.010
<v Speaker 4>western front,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but those injuries that it did inflict.</v>

1814
01:53:08.011 --> 01:53:13.011
<v Speaker 4>We're often grievous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Contemporary psychiatrist agreed that </v>

1815
01:53:13.011 --> 01:53:16.800
<v Speaker 4>men's primary fear was not death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but mutilation wounds to the stomach,</v>

1816
01:53:16.801 --> 01:53:21.801
<v Speaker 4>jaw and dyes were particularly dreaded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is that significant that artillery </v>

1817
01:53:21.801 --> 01:53:24.540
<v Speaker 4>fire was more likely than any other </v>
<v Speaker 4>weapon to cause head wounds.</v>

1818
01:53:24.750 --> 01:53:29.750
<v Speaker 4>Moreover,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shells were terrifying because as </v>

1819
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.750
<v Speaker 4>lieutenants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>st lagers,</v>

1820
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:33.530
<v Speaker 4>somewhat coyly observed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they could make such a mess of one and </v>

1821
01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:35.310
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watson continues quote,</v>

1822
01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:37.740
<v Speaker 4>the weapon eviscerated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maimed,</v>

1823
01:53:37.741 --> 01:53:42.741
<v Speaker 4>and disfigured body parts could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>scattered over wide distances and legs </v>

1824
01:53:42.741 --> 01:53:45.480
<v Speaker 4>and arms blown into trees by the force </v>
<v Speaker 4>of explosions.</v>

1825
01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:48.390
<v Speaker 4>Such sites were obviously extremely </v>
<v Speaker 4>disturbing,</v>

1826
01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:51.150
<v Speaker 4>especially when the victims were friends</v>
<v Speaker 4>or comrades.</v>

1827
01:53:51.390 --> 01:53:55.320
<v Speaker 4>As lieutenant boxall remarked quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have seen a shell fall into the</v>

1828
01:53:55.321 --> 01:53:59.010
<v Speaker 4>midst of six men and packed three of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them away in a sandbag,</v>

1829
01:53:59.250 --> 01:54:02.370
<v Speaker 4>one wonders whether anything matters and</v>
<v Speaker 4>to quote</v>

1830
01:54:04.730 --> 01:54:09.410
<v Speaker 1>this is when you realize though that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are veterans in this combat</v>

1831
01:54:09.411 --> 01:54:14.411
<v Speaker 1>and that this makes a huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people have been hardened to their</v>

1832
01:54:14.541 --> 01:54:19.541
<v Speaker 1>current state by degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by seeing many horrible things in the </v>

1833
01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:25.720
<v Speaker 1>past and living through situations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>while they might not be as extreme as </v>

1834
01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:28.910
<v Speaker 1>what they're about to go through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our smaller versions on the way there,</v>

1835
01:54:28.911 --> 01:54:33.911
<v Speaker 1>it's like lifting a smaller amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight on your way up to lifting a </v>

1836
01:54:33.911 --> 01:54:37.361
<v Speaker 1>greater amount of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like taking a week civilian </v>

1837
01:54:37.361 --> 01:54:40.871
<v Speaker 1>like yours truly and throwing him into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kaiser sherlocked tomorrow and then </v>

1838
01:54:40.871 --> 01:54:43.010
<v Speaker 1>expecting him to endure under shell </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

1839
01:54:44.070 --> 01:54:47.700
<v Speaker 1>And while there are certainly people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fell apart under shell fire,</v>

1840
01:54:47.701 --> 01:54:50.160
<v Speaker 1>broken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ran under shall fire lost their minds.</v>

1841
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:51.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to shell shock.</v>

1842
01:54:51.511 --> 01:54:54.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the amazing story here,</v>

1843
01:54:54.061 --> 01:54:59.061
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is what has amazed </v>
<v Speaker 1>people throughout history since it </v>

1844
01:54:59.061 --> 01:54:59.061
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the vast,</v>

1845
01:54:59.061 --> 01:55:04.041
<v Speaker 1>vast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vast majority of people stayed there in </v>

1846
01:55:04.041 --> 01:55:07.161
<v Speaker 1>those positions and took it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having the logical part of their brain </v>

1847
01:55:08.770 --> 01:55:13.770
<v Speaker 1>and self control somehow overriding </v>
<v Speaker 1>their animal instincts that must have </v>

1848
01:55:13.770 --> 01:55:15.160
<v Speaker 1>been screaming at them to simply flea.</v>

1849
01:55:16.990 --> 01:55:21.990
<v Speaker 1>But as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people had been hardened by what </v>

1850
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:24.200
<v Speaker 1>they'd seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1851
01:55:24.201 --> 01:55:26.330
<v Speaker 1>the very day before March,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

1852
01:55:26.331 --> 01:55:28.520
<v Speaker 1>first before this artillery barrage </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

1853
01:55:28.850 --> 01:55:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Ernst Junger is in a shell hole in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively safe part of the line.</v>

1854
01:55:36.710 --> 01:55:41.710
<v Speaker 1>He and an officer are in one and a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of manner in the big shell hole </v>

1855
01:55:41.710 --> 01:55:43.470
<v Speaker 1>next to his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an amphitheater he says,</v>

1856
01:55:43.740 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 1>and they're</v>

1857
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:46.650
<v Speaker 4>sort of having a meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's stack their weapons and it's</v>

1858
01:55:46.651 --> 01:55:51.651
<v Speaker 4>calm and they're shell fire going on and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then all of a sudden sort of a random </v>

1859
01:55:51.651 --> 01:55:55.251
<v Speaker 4>stray shell falls into that big crater </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's built like an amphitheater that </v>

1860
01:55:55.251 --> 01:56:00.021
<v Speaker 4>had 100 men in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's maybe the most gruesome upsetting </v>

1861
01:56:00.891 --> 01:56:04.100
<v Speaker 4>part of youngers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gruesome and upsetting story.</v>

1862
01:56:04.101 --> 01:56:07.610
<v Speaker 4>And he says after the explosion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so freaked him out.</v>

1863
01:56:07.611 --> 01:56:08.960
<v Speaker 4>And this is Ernst Junger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't.</v>

1864
01:56:08.961 --> 01:56:10.640
<v Speaker 4>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the Veterans Veterans,</v>

1865
01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:13.880
<v Speaker 4>he goes tearing off running in a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a panic before.</v>

1866
01:56:13.881 --> 01:56:18.881
<v Speaker 4>Eventually he'll stop himself and </v>
<v Speaker 4>realizes he should go back and try to </v>

1867
01:56:18.881 --> 01:56:18.881
<v Speaker 4>help some of those men.</v>

1868
01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:21.980
<v Speaker 4>But then that same orange junger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1869
01:56:21.981 --> 01:56:23.540
<v Speaker 4>that next morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is,</v>

1870
01:56:23.541 --> 01:56:28.541
<v Speaker 4>12,</v>
<v Speaker 4>15 hours afterwards is going to be </v>

1871
01:56:28.541 --> 01:56:29.360
<v Speaker 4>sitting in his jumping off point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>synchronizing his watch,</v>

1872
01:56:29.361 --> 01:56:32.570
<v Speaker 4>watching this artillery drop on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>British and getting ready to go over the</v>

1873
01:56:32.571 --> 01:56:37.571
<v Speaker 4>top and attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's amazing is when he does so he </v>

1874
01:56:37.641 --> 01:56:42.641
<v Speaker 4>does so in an almost giddy fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to describe the,</v>

1875
01:56:43.890 --> 01:56:45.830
<v Speaker 4>the mood that these soldiers going over </v>
<v Speaker 4>the top,</v>

1876
01:56:46.130 --> 01:56:47.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>suggest during this battle.</v>

1877
01:56:47.661 --> 01:56:52.661
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ernst young or is not necessarily </v>

1878
01:56:52.661 --> 01:56:52.661
<v Speaker 4>representative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he says everybody else,</v>

1879
01:56:52.661 --> 01:56:54.020
<v Speaker 4>we're sort of kind of on the edge of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sanity,</v>

1880
01:56:54.021 --> 01:56:59.021
<v Speaker 4>almost busy work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But at the same time he says that they </v>

1881
01:56:59.021 --> 01:57:02.561
<v Speaker 4>would talk to each other and it would </v>
<v Speaker 4>only come out in little fragments of </v>

1882
01:57:02.561 --> 01:57:02.561
<v Speaker 4>sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

1883
01:57:02.561 --> 01:57:04.760
<v Speaker 4>anybody who was observing us would think</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were incredibly happy</v>

1884
01:57:06.460 --> 01:57:11.460
<v Speaker 4>and at the same time he's talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this rage that's coming over him and he </v>

1885
01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:14.621
<v Speaker 4>squeezes his eyes and the tears are </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming out and he's ready to hurt </v>

1886
01:57:14.621 --> 01:57:18.131
<v Speaker 4>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what's funny when you read it is it </v>

1887
01:57:18.141 --> 01:57:23.141
<v Speaker 4>kind of reminds you something that may </v>
<v Speaker 4>be in the back of your head you knew </v>

1888
01:57:23.141 --> 01:57:24.890
<v Speaker 4>already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think when we look at these modern</v>

1889
01:57:24.891 --> 01:57:28.120
<v Speaker 4>soldiers coming from Nice backgrounds </v>
<v Speaker 4>like ourselves and you know,</v>

1890
01:57:28.130 --> 01:57:30.800
<v Speaker 4>well trained and educated and all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>kinds of things,</v>

1891
01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:36.280
<v Speaker 4>we somehow assume that the very </v>
<v Speaker 4>tendencies that we will freely admit </v>

1892
01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:41.021
<v Speaker 4>that ancient peoples had and vikings hat</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all these kinds of peoples that </v>

1893
01:57:41.021 --> 01:57:41.960
<v Speaker 4>could get up into a busy work rage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1894
01:57:41.961 --> 01:57:46.961
<v Speaker 4>and kill a victim and stand up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>celebrate in it and enjoy being a </v>

1895
01:57:46.961 --> 01:57:50.531
<v Speaker 4>warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That somehow because we have aircraft </v>

1896
01:57:50.531 --> 01:57:52.250
<v Speaker 4>and artillery machine guns and a nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that it's all gone.</v>

1897
01:57:53.830 --> 01:57:57.220
<v Speaker 4>And in some people it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in some people it's not.</v>

1898
01:57:57.820 --> 01:58:02.820
<v Speaker 4>And Ernst Junger goes looking for </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone to kill when he jumps out of </v>

1899
01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:07.051
<v Speaker 4>these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jumping off points after the artillery </v>

1900
01:58:07.051 --> 01:58:07.690
<v Speaker 4>barrage lifts in the German Army,</v>
<v Speaker 4>attacks on March 21st,</v>

1901
01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:13.320
<v Speaker 4>the big sweep at Operation Michael.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's foggy by the way.</v>

1902
01:58:14.020 --> 01:58:19.020
<v Speaker 4>This will be one of the things that Luke</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dorf will get lucky with a couple of </v>

1903
01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:21.991
<v Speaker 4>times in his multi punch combination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fog is not great for the German </v>

1904
01:58:21.991 --> 01:58:22.450
<v Speaker 4>attackers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes it difficult,</v>

1905
01:58:22.690 --> 01:58:26.620
<v Speaker 4>but it's a nightmare for the defenders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Germans are using what are sometimes</v>

1906
01:58:26.621 --> 01:58:31.621
<v Speaker 4>called infiltration tactics and if it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>foggy infiltration tactics are a lot </v>

1907
01:58:31.621 --> 01:58:34.150
<v Speaker 4>more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The British have setup all these defense</v>

1908
01:58:34.151 --> 01:58:39.151
<v Speaker 4>zones with crossing machine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gun fire and all these things were all </v>

1909
01:58:39.151 --> 01:58:39.250
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all these different defense readouts can</v>

1910
01:58:39.251 --> 01:58:44.251
<v Speaker 4>help each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but because of the they can't see </v>

1911
01:58:44.251 --> 01:58:46.741
<v Speaker 4>anything and then all of a sudden the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germans are jumping into the trenches </v>

1912
01:58:49.291 --> 01:58:53.160
<v Speaker 4>where the British soldiers are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You catching them totally off guard</v>

1913
01:58:54.620 --> 01:58:57.620
<v Speaker 4>historian Peter Harte quotes Captain </v>
<v Speaker 4>Charles Miller,</v>

1914
01:58:57.621 --> 01:59:00.740
<v Speaker 4>who was on the line as the German's </v>
<v Speaker 4>approach for their initial attack.</v>

1915
01:59:00.741 --> 01:59:02.450
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before 9:00</v>

1916
01:59:02.450 --> 01:59:05.060
<v Speaker 4>AM on the morning of the 21st through </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fog and says quote.</v>

1917
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:09.110
<v Speaker 4>The first attackers were into the trench</v>
<v Speaker 4>long before the [inaudible] lifted.</v>

1918
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:12.590
<v Speaker 4>I was so occupied with the flanks that I</v>
<v Speaker 4>barely saw them before.</v>

1919
01:59:12.591 --> 01:59:16.310
<v Speaker 4>They appeared out of the mist and leapt </v>
<v Speaker 4>down into the trench in a moment.</v>

1920
01:59:16.311 --> 01:59:18.560
<v Speaker 4>We were all mixed up in hand to hand </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting.</v>

1921
01:59:18.860 --> 01:59:21.260
<v Speaker 4>I had two men coming at me with their </v>
<v Speaker 4>bayonets,</v>

1922
01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:26.440
<v Speaker 4>one of whom I think I shot with my </v>
<v Speaker 4>revolver while a sergeant standing just </v>

1923
01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:28.580
<v Speaker 4>behind me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shot the other at point blank range with</v>

1924
01:59:28.581 --> 01:59:31.940
<v Speaker 4>his rifle barrel over my shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but almost at the same second,</v>

1925
01:59:32.090 --> 01:59:37.090
<v Speaker 4>a German stick bomb came whistling into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the trench from the parapet right into </v>

1926
01:59:37.090 --> 01:59:39.710
<v Speaker 4>the bunch of us and killed or wounded </v>
<v Speaker 4>practically the whole lot of us,</v>

1927
01:59:39.890 --> 01:59:44.890
<v Speaker 4>English and German alike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether it was actually this bomb or a </v>

1928
01:59:44.890 --> 01:59:45.920
<v Speaker 4>bayonet stabbed that gave me the wound </v>
<v Speaker 4>in my neck.</v>

1929
01:59:45.921 --> 01:59:47.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might've been either</v>

1930
01:59:48.210 --> 01:59:49.620
<v Speaker 4>for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were clear,</v>

1931
01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:52.170
<v Speaker 4>but there was a nasty little shambles </v>
<v Speaker 4>around us.</v>

1932
01:59:52.350 --> 01:59:54.900
<v Speaker 4>Sergeant Ad Cock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who had just saved my life.</v>

1933
01:59:55.050 --> 02:00:00.050
<v Speaker 4>Having his head blown off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt awfully weak and discovered that </v>

1934
02:00:00.050 --> 02:00:00.870
<v Speaker 4>a river of blood was flowing from my </v>
<v Speaker 4>neck.</v>

1935
02:00:01.110 --> 02:00:06.110
<v Speaker 4>I tried to bandage it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the bandage wouldn't hold before </v>

1936
02:00:06.110 --> 02:00:09.501
<v Speaker 4>they attacked us again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They brought up some trench mortars and </v>

1937
02:00:09.501 --> 02:00:10.920
<v Speaker 4>knocked seven bells out of us than </v>
<v Speaker 4>swarmed into the trench.</v>

1938
02:00:11.190 --> 02:00:16.190
<v Speaker 4>By that time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were only a handful of us left on </v>

1939
02:00:16.190 --> 02:00:18.321
<v Speaker 4>our feet and all I suppose wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got another wound from a stick bomb </v>

1940
02:00:18.321 --> 02:00:20.760
<v Speaker 4>which put a bit of metal into my thigh </v>
<v Speaker 4>before I collapsed.</v>

1941
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:26.000
<v Speaker 4>I tried to give the surrender signal and</v>
<v Speaker 4>hoped I succeeded thereby in saving a </v>

1942
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.000
<v Speaker 4>few lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had done our best and to quote,</v>

1943
02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:35.050
<v Speaker 4>and one of the things that happens with </v>
<v Speaker 4>these modern battles is that they really</v>

1944
02:00:35.051 --> 02:00:40.051
<v Speaker 4>turn into hundreds of smaller encounters</v>
<v Speaker 4>that when you add them up together equal</v>

1945
02:00:40.461 --> 02:00:45.461
<v Speaker 4>this big thing going on over 40 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you read the accounts of these </v>

1946
02:00:45.461 --> 02:00:45.520
<v Speaker 4>battles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they all sound like,</v>

1947
02:00:45.790 --> 02:00:50.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and 10 guys took that machine gun </v>

1948
02:00:50.790 --> 02:00:54.120
<v Speaker 4>nest 100 yards away and it took us three</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours and we lost two men and we killed </v>

1949
02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:55.060
<v Speaker 4>everybody in the machine gun nest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we continued to move on.</v>

1950
02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:57.340
<v Speaker 4>That's an encounter in this war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1951
02:00:57.670 --> 02:01:02.670
<v Speaker 4>So every time you read one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sounds like an isolated little </v>

1952
02:01:02.670 --> 02:01:02.670
<v Speaker 4>incident.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

1953
02:01:02.670 --> 02:01:05.140
<v Speaker 4>younger when he comes upon the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>enemy soldier,</v>

1954
02:01:05.141 --> 02:01:09.670
<v Speaker 4>he sees on March 21st it's this private </v>
<v Speaker 4>encounter,</v>

1955
02:01:09.671 --> 02:01:14.671
<v Speaker 4>this moment where youngers in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>almost buzzard mood that he just talked </v>

1956
02:01:14.771 --> 02:01:15.550
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Giddy,</v>

1957
02:01:15.551 --> 02:01:18.880
<v Speaker 4>they'd been drinking alcohol there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>punch drunk from all the artillery.</v>

1958
02:01:18.881 --> 02:01:21.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just a sensory overload and he sees</v>

1959
02:01:21.611 --> 02:01:23.980
<v Speaker 4>this enemy and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote.</v>

1960
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:28.780
<v Speaker 4>Then I saw my first enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a figure in Brown,</v>

1961
02:01:28.781 --> 02:01:32.830
<v Speaker 4>uniform wounded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently crouched 20 paces away in the</v>

1962
02:01:32.831 --> 02:01:36.100
<v Speaker 4>middle of the battered path with his </v>
<v Speaker 4>hands propped on the ground.</v>

1963
02:01:36.430 --> 02:01:38.950
<v Speaker 4>I turned a corner and we caught sight of</v>
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>

1964
02:01:39.170 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 4>I saw him jump</v>

1965
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:43.520
<v Speaker 1>as I approached and stare at me with </v>
<v Speaker 1>gaping eyes while I,</v>

1966
02:01:43.521 --> 02:01:47.600
<v Speaker 1>with my face behind my pistol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stocked up to him slowly and coldly.</v>

1967
02:01:47.930 --> 02:01:51.020
<v Speaker 1>A bloody scene with no witnesses was </v>
<v Speaker 1>about to happen.</v>

1968
02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:54.650
<v Speaker 1>It was a relief to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally to have the photo in front of me</v>

1969
02:01:54.651 --> 02:01:59.651
<v Speaker 1>and within reach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I set the mouth of the pistol at the </v>

1970
02:01:59.651 --> 02:02:02.471
<v Speaker 1>man's temple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was too frightened to move while my </v>

1971
02:02:02.471 --> 02:02:05.741
<v Speaker 1>other fist grabbed hold of his tunic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling metals and badges of rank and </v>

1972
02:02:05.741 --> 02:02:10.181
<v Speaker 1>officer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He must have held some command post in </v>

1973
02:02:10.181 --> 02:02:10.250
<v Speaker 1>these trenches with the plaintiff's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound.</v>

1974
02:02:10.370 --> 02:02:13.310
<v Speaker 1>He reached into his pocket not to pull </v>
<v Speaker 1>out a weapon,</v>

1975
02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:16.880
<v Speaker 1>but a photograph which he held up to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw him on it,</v>

1976
02:02:17.180 --> 02:02:20.660
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by numerous family all </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing on a terrorist.</v>

1977
02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:24.170
<v Speaker 1>It was a plea from another world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Later,</v>

1978
02:02:24.171 --> 02:02:27.350
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was blind chance that I let</v>
<v Speaker 1>him go and plunged onward.</v>

1979
02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:30.650
<v Speaker 1>That one man of all often appeared in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

1980
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:34.760
<v Speaker 1>I hope that meant he got to see his </v>
<v Speaker 1>homeland again and to quote</v>

1981
02:02:36.580 --> 02:02:41.580
<v Speaker 1>so even in the blind rage of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>busywork moment that younger had </v>

1982
02:02:43.001 --> 02:02:48.001
<v Speaker 1>described earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was able to pull himself from the </v>

1983
02:02:48.001 --> 02:02:50.770
<v Speaker 1>brink and answer that plea from another </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and let that soldier live.</v>

1984
02:02:51.850 --> 02:02:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Mercy could be a dangerous commodity on </v>
<v Speaker 1>a battlefield like this.</v>

1985
02:02:56.120 --> 02:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>It was very normal for soldiers going </v>
<v Speaker 1>past something like a bunker that might </v>

1986
02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:05.701
<v Speaker 1>have enemy troops in it to just simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw grenades down the stairs into the </v>

1987
02:03:05.701 --> 02:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>bunker and not worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just keep on moving.</v>

1988
02:03:07.930 --> 02:03:12.930
<v Speaker 1>There were also a killings in hot blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the time it was normal.</v>

1989
02:03:14.171 --> 02:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if troops kept firing at you all the way</v>

1990
02:03:17.201 --> 02:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>up until you were almost on top of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then tried to surrender,</v>

1991
02:03:20.141 --> 02:03:25.141
<v Speaker 1>good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was killing in cold blood too on </v>

1992
02:03:25.141 --> 02:03:28.261
<v Speaker 1>all sides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by and large when they could both </v>

1993
02:03:28.261 --> 02:03:32.371
<v Speaker 1>sides like to take prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of these armies surrendered in </v>

1994
02:03:32.371 --> 02:03:36.751
<v Speaker 1>large numbers though was quite unusual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a mark of what a great first day </v>

1995
02:03:36.971 --> 02:03:41.971
<v Speaker 1>operation Michael has is that it sees a </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge amount of British troops </v>

1996
02:03:41.971 --> 02:03:43.960
<v Speaker 1>surrendering in numbers that you never </v>
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

1997
02:03:43.990 --> 02:03:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Twenty 1000 of them on the first day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>17,000</v>

1998
02:03:48.521 --> 02:03:53.521
<v Speaker 1>of these people had been casualties due </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that for our initial bombardment so </v>

1999
02:03:54.551 --> 02:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>you can see how their nerves are shot in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some cases</v>

2000
02:03:59.100 --> 02:04:04.100
<v Speaker 1>that they are infected by all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical symptoms that we called it </v>

2001
02:04:04.100 --> 02:04:07.791
<v Speaker 1>earlier and that they're just stunned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Historian John Keegan tells a story of a</v>

2002
02:04:10.211 --> 02:04:13.780
<v Speaker 1>British machine gunner who must've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty representative of this day,</v>

2003
02:04:13.781 --> 02:04:18.781
<v Speaker 1>who is mowing down German soldiers like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ernst Junger as they approach his </v>

2004
02:04:18.781 --> 02:04:23.101
<v Speaker 1>machine gun position and Keegan quotes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the soldier as saying quote.</v>

2005
02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:27.820
<v Speaker 1>I thought we'd stopped them when I felt </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bump in the back.</v>

2006
02:04:28.090 --> 02:04:32.140
<v Speaker 1>I turned around and there was a German </v>
<v Speaker 1>officer with a revolver in my back.</v>

2007
02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Come along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tommy,</v>

2008
02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:36.640
<v Speaker 1>you've done enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I turned round and then said,</v>

2009
02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:38.220
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

2010
02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:42.450
<v Speaker 4>I know what I would've done if I had </v>
<v Speaker 4>been held up by a machine gunner and had</v>

2011
02:04:42.451 --> 02:04:45.270
<v Speaker 4>that revolver in my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a finished him off.</v>

2012
02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:48.810
<v Speaker 4>He must have been a real gentleman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was 20 past 10.</v>

2013
02:04:48.990 --> 02:04:53.990
<v Speaker 4>I know to the minute because I looked at</v>
<v Speaker 4>my watch end quote and if you actually </v>

2014
02:04:55.231 --> 02:05:00.231
<v Speaker 4>had to surrender to Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know while this offensive was going </v>

2015
02:05:00.231 --> 02:05:01.050
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it could be a very near run thing.</v>

2016
02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:06.220
<v Speaker 4>British private Alfred Gross is captured</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the 22nd of March,</v>

2017
02:05:06.221 --> 02:05:09.880
<v Speaker 4>so the next day with a boy as he </v>
<v Speaker 4>described him,</v>

2018
02:05:09.881 --> 02:05:14.881
<v Speaker 4>but a soldier nonetheless who's badly </v>
<v Speaker 4>hit in the head and he's bleeding and </v>

2019
02:05:14.921 --> 02:05:19.921
<v Speaker 4>gross writes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote the area we cross swept by rifle </v>

2020
02:05:19.921 --> 02:05:21.820
<v Speaker 4>and machine gun fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We crawl an escape it.</v>

2021
02:05:22.030 --> 02:05:25.480
<v Speaker 4>The boy is in pain and crying presently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He jumps up.</v>

2022
02:05:25.690 --> 02:05:27.190
<v Speaker 4>Here they come,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he cries.</v>

2023
02:05:27.250 --> 02:05:28.750
<v Speaker 4>I pull him down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who?</v>

2024
02:05:28.810 --> 02:05:30.790
<v Speaker 4>I asked Jerry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

2025
02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:33.610
<v Speaker 4>I look cautiously up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is right enough.</v>

2026
02:05:33.611 --> 02:05:38.290
<v Speaker 4>The first wave almost on top of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and quote grouches account continues.</v>

2027
02:05:38.730 --> 02:05:40.480
<v Speaker 4>Quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>leave it to me.</v>

2028
02:05:40.481 --> 02:05:41.650
<v Speaker 4>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're done.</v>

2029
02:05:41.710 --> 02:05:44.170
<v Speaker 4>We're prisoners now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do whatever I tell you.</v>

2030
02:05:44.350 --> 02:05:48.370
<v Speaker 4>I wait a second and then up I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and take your helmet off.</v>

2031
02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:51.160
<v Speaker 4>We do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the German in front of me says,</v>

2032
02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:54.010
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>raises his rifle and takes aim.</v>

2033
02:05:54.220 --> 02:05:57.400
<v Speaker 4>I muttered to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope to God he won't pull that trigger</v>

2034
02:05:57.700 --> 02:05:59.210
<v Speaker 4>for 10 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We remain.</v>

2035
02:05:59.211 --> 02:06:03.730
<v Speaker 4>So then he lowers his rifle and says </v>
<v Speaker 4>what I take to be wounded.</v>

2036
02:06:04.210 --> 02:06:05.530
<v Speaker 4>I nod and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

2037
02:06:05.531 --> 02:06:07.750
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He beckons and we approach.</v>

2038
02:06:07.870 --> 02:06:10.210
<v Speaker 4>We still have our equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dawn and the Germans,</v>

2039
02:06:10.211 --> 02:06:12.490
<v Speaker 4>other shouts pointing to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>slip it off.</v>

2040
02:06:12.520 --> 02:06:16.090
<v Speaker 4>I cried at the boy doing it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The German has spared us.</v>

2041
02:06:16.270 --> 02:06:19.570
<v Speaker 4>Would we have spared him under the </v>
<v Speaker 4>circumstances God knows,</v>

2042
02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:21.550
<v Speaker 4>perhaps not and to quote,</v>

2043
02:06:23.250 --> 02:06:27.180
<v Speaker 4>but that same sort of gallantry you see </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the German side in cases like this is</v>

2044
02:06:27.181 --> 02:06:30.870
<v Speaker 4>present on the French side and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>British side and the Russian side.</v>

2045
02:06:30.871 --> 02:06:35.871
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a human element coming forth in </v>

2046
02:06:35.871 --> 02:06:38.901
<v Speaker 4>the midst of all this evil and of course</v>
<v Speaker 4>just as something to juxtaposition the </v>

2047
02:06:38.901 --> 02:06:42.921
<v Speaker 4>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see the killing of prisoners by all </v>

2048
02:06:42.921 --> 02:06:46.791
<v Speaker 4>sides as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ian Passingham calls March 21st the day </v>

2049
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:52.910
<v Speaker 4>of the opening of the Michael Offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first punch in the multi punch </v>

2050
02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:52.910
<v Speaker 4>combination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2051
02:06:52.910 --> 02:06:57.261
<v Speaker 4>That the Germans are going to throw one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the most dramatic days of the whole </v>

2052
02:06:57.261 --> 02:07:00.291
<v Speaker 4>war and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote in the event,</v>

2053
02:07:00.721 --> 02:07:05.721
<v Speaker 4>and despite numerous tales of heroic </v>
<v Speaker 4>last stands and daring do the 21st of </v>

2054
02:07:05.721 --> 02:07:08.160
<v Speaker 4>March was a disastrous day for Hague's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>B,</v>

2055
02:07:08.161 --> 02:07:09.990
<v Speaker 4>e,</v>
<v Speaker 4>f meaning the British forces.</v>

2056
02:07:10.260 --> 02:07:12.780
<v Speaker 4>It was the bloodiest day of the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>world war.</v>

2057
02:07:12.990 --> 02:07:15.870
<v Speaker 4>There were over 78,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>casualties,</v>

2058
02:07:16.020 --> 02:07:19.710
<v Speaker 4>almost 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>on each side though the storm troops had</v>

2059
02:07:19.711 --> 02:07:24.711
<v Speaker 4>advanced in one or two places up to 10 </v>
<v Speaker 4>miles by the end of the day in the </v>

2060
02:07:24.711 --> 02:07:25.200
<v Speaker 4>south.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Overall 20,</v>

2061
02:07:25.201 --> 02:07:30.201
<v Speaker 4>first of March was a day of great </v>
<v Speaker 4>sacrifice and confusion and quote 78,000</v>

2062
02:07:32.241 --> 02:07:36.040
<v Speaker 4>casualties in one day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's your new world's record</v>

2063
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:39.490
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The horrible battle of Waterloo,</v>

2064
02:07:39.530 --> 02:07:43.840
<v Speaker 1>100 years previously had seen maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>60,000</v>

2065
02:07:43.841 --> 02:07:48.841
<v Speaker 1>casualties on the first day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was no second day at the </v>

2066
02:07:48.841 --> 02:07:53.080
<v Speaker 1>battle of Waterloo operation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael led to 78,000</v>

2067
02:07:53.081 --> 02:07:58.081
<v Speaker 1>casualties on the first day of the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>punch of a multi punch combination that </v>

2068
02:07:58.081 --> 02:08:01.400
<v Speaker 1>would go on for months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Randall Gray,</v>

2069
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:06.430
<v Speaker 1>who wrote a piece on the Kaiser Slot </v>
<v Speaker 1>said it was quote the greatest and most </v>

2070
02:08:06.430 --> 02:08:10.250
<v Speaker 1>intense battle ever fought by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British army and quote.</v>

2071
02:08:11.210 --> 02:08:12.380
<v Speaker 1>He also said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

2072
02:08:12.770 --> 02:08:16.280
<v Speaker 1>it certainly represented the most awful </v>
<v Speaker 1>non-nuclear,</v>

2073
02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:21.340
<v Speaker 1>but chemical fighting or deal undergone </v>
<v Speaker 1>by 20th century soldiers with the </v>

2074
02:08:21.441 --> 02:08:26.441
<v Speaker 1>possible exception of some 1941,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1945 eastern front battles and the Iran </v>

2075
02:08:27.350 --> 02:08:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Iraq war and the quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always try to remind myself that what </v>

2076
02:08:34.461 --> 02:08:37.220
<v Speaker 1>these soldiers went through with these </v>
<v Speaker 1>battles,</v>

2077
02:08:37.970 --> 02:08:42.240
<v Speaker 1>scarred them forever and and and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know there's a difference.</v>

2078
02:08:42.241 --> 02:08:44.430
<v Speaker 1>We should understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there are a lot of people who go to</v>

2079
02:08:44.431 --> 02:08:46.140
<v Speaker 1>war who never see any combat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

2080
02:08:46.410 --> 02:08:50.190
<v Speaker 1>who deal with paperwork or logistics or </v>
<v Speaker 1>supply and they're all very important,</v>

2081
02:08:50.191 --> 02:08:55.191
<v Speaker 1>but the people who come home after this </v>
<v Speaker 1>war and change the psyche of the world,</v>

2082
02:08:56.881 --> 02:08:58.260
<v Speaker 1>the writers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thinkers,</v>

2083
02:08:58.590 --> 02:09:03.590
<v Speaker 1>just just the everyday people whose </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitudes have been shocked into a </v>

2084
02:09:03.590 --> 02:09:07.341
<v Speaker 1>different paradigm by what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience in this combat go through </v>

2085
02:09:07.341 --> 02:09:08.940
<v Speaker 1>things that have to haunt them.</v>

2086
02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:12.950
<v Speaker 1>I was particularly moved in one of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>kaiser shocked battles.</v>

2087
02:09:12.951 --> 02:09:17.951
<v Speaker 1>A German soldier under artillery barrage</v>
<v Speaker 1>talks about what happened to him and </v>

2088
02:09:18.471 --> 02:09:23.471
<v Speaker 1>when you think about him having to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this memory the rest of his life </v>

2089
02:09:23.471 --> 02:09:23.690
<v Speaker 1>and how it altered him on a personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

2090
02:09:23.870 --> 02:09:28.870
<v Speaker 1>and then imagine millions of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>had seen equally scarring events in </v>

2091
02:09:29.121 --> 02:09:32.150
<v Speaker 1>their lives who went on to help create </v>
<v Speaker 1>this postwar world.</v>

2092
02:09:32.480 --> 02:09:37.480
<v Speaker 1>And you can see how this war dug deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the psyche of 20th century </v>

2093
02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:39.980
<v Speaker 1>civilization and gouged out a permanent </v>
<v Speaker 1>wound.</v>

2094
02:09:41.660 --> 02:09:45.110
<v Speaker 1>The soldiers under French artillery fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one of these battles.</v>

2095
02:09:45.111 --> 02:09:45.950
<v Speaker 1>And he writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

2096
02:09:46.730 --> 02:09:49.580
<v Speaker 1>French shells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>began to hit to the right and left of us</v>

2097
02:09:49.790 --> 02:09:54.790
<v Speaker 1>leaving human forms writhing in agony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our advanced came to a stop and after </v>

2098
02:09:54.831 --> 02:09:56.960
<v Speaker 1>hesitating a few minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we drew back.</v>

2099
02:09:56.961 --> 02:10:01.961
<v Speaker 1>While the artillery fire followed us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ripping large gashes in our formation.</v>

2100
02:10:02.270 --> 02:10:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Soon the French drum firing Gulf dust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The air was filled with gas and flying </v>

2101
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:10.190
<v Speaker 1>pieces of steel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We automatically mounted the machine gun</v>

2102
02:10:10.191 --> 02:10:12.200
<v Speaker 1>for action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like animals,</v>

2103
02:10:12.201 --> 02:10:16.070
<v Speaker 1>we burrowed into the earth as if trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to find protection deepen its bosom.</v>

2104
02:10:16.370 --> 02:10:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Something struck my back where I carried</v>
<v Speaker 1>my gas mask,</v>

2105
02:10:19.311 --> 02:10:24.311
<v Speaker 1>but I did not pay attention to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A steel splinter broke the handle of my </v>

2106
02:10:24.311 --> 02:10:26.630
<v Speaker 1>spade and another knocked the remains </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of my hand.</v>

2107
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:29.600
<v Speaker 1>I kept digging with my bare hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ducking my head.</v>

2108
02:10:29.601 --> 02:10:34.601
<v Speaker 1>Every time a shell exploded nearby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a boy to my side hit in the arm and </v>

2109
02:10:34.601 --> 02:10:35.450
<v Speaker 1>cried out for help.</v>

2110
02:10:35.660 --> 02:10:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I crawled over to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rip the sleeves of his coat and shirt </v>

2111
02:10:40.660 --> 02:10:41.720
<v Speaker 1>open and started to bind the bleeding </v>
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>

2112
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:45.020
<v Speaker 1>The gas was now so thick that I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardly discern what I was doing.</v>

2113
02:10:45.230 --> 02:10:47.930
<v Speaker 1>My eyes began to water and I felt as if </v>
<v Speaker 1>I would choke.</v>

2114
02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:51.710
<v Speaker 1>I reached for my gas mask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling it out of its container and then</v>

2115
02:10:51.711 --> 02:10:54.410
<v Speaker 1>notice to my horror that a splinter had </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone through it,</v>

2116
02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:58.790
<v Speaker 1>leaving a large hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had seen death thousands of times,</v>

2117
02:10:59.060 --> 02:11:02.540
<v Speaker 1>stared it in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but never experienced the fear I felt.</v>

2118
02:11:02.541 --> 02:11:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Then immediately I reverted to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>primitive.</v>

2119
02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:10.540
<v Speaker 1>I felt like an animal cornered by </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunters with the instinct of self </v>

2120
02:11:10.540 --> 02:11:12.330
<v Speaker 1>preservation upper most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My eyes fell on the boy who's armed.</v>

2121
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I had bandaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow he'd managed to put the gas mask</v>

2122
02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:20.920
<v Speaker 1>on his face with his one good arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I leapt at him and in the next moment </v>

2123
02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:23.210
<v Speaker 1>had ripped the gas masks from his face </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a feeble gesture.</v>

2124
02:11:23.211 --> 02:11:26.930
<v Speaker 1>He tried to wrench it from my grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then fell back exhausted.</v>

2125
02:11:27.140 --> 02:11:32.140
<v Speaker 1>The last thing I saw before putting on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mask where his pleading eyes and to </v>

2126
02:11:32.140 --> 02:11:32.140
<v Speaker 1>quote</v>

2127
02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:35.400
<v Speaker 1>that's related in Peter Hearts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful book,</v>

2128
02:11:35.401 --> 02:11:40.401
<v Speaker 1>the Great War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has such a way of finding those </v>

2129
02:11:40.401 --> 02:11:43.131
<v Speaker 1>incidents that when you read about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they they boggle your mind and then you </v>

2130
02:11:43.131 --> 02:11:46.540
<v Speaker 1>can go forget about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but imagine the guy who has to live with</v>

2131
02:11:46.541 --> 02:11:51.540
<v Speaker 1>that the rest of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those kinds of moments that the extremes</v>

2132
02:11:51.541 --> 02:11:56.290
<v Speaker 1>of human experience where these moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>choices are thrust in your face like the</v>

2133
02:11:56.290 --> 02:12:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Ernst Young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do I shoot this guy before he shows </v>

2134
02:12:01.290 --> 02:12:03.201
<v Speaker 1>me the picture of his family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of what makes these wars </v>

2135
02:12:03.201 --> 02:12:06.741
<v Speaker 1>fascinating is how do people behave when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are under this kind of intense </v>

2136
02:12:08.251 --> 02:12:10.830
<v Speaker 1>pressure and strange extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>

2137
02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:13.410
<v Speaker 1>This is what's happening at the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

2138
02:12:13.860 --> 02:12:18.860
<v Speaker 1>At the big picture level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This last card played by the Germans </v>

2139
02:12:18.860 --> 02:12:23.661
<v Speaker 1>here has been shockingly effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British fifth army,</v>

2140
02:12:24.031 --> 02:12:29.031
<v Speaker 1>which let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in no position to be taking on a </v>

2141
02:12:29.031 --> 02:12:30.900
<v Speaker 1>German force like this at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had been recovering from a previous</v>

2142
02:12:30.901 --> 02:12:35.901
<v Speaker 1>battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were holding too large a part of </v>

2143
02:12:35.901 --> 02:12:37.851
<v Speaker 1>the front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had infrastructure and defenses </v>

2144
02:12:37.851 --> 02:12:39.960
<v Speaker 1>that needed some work and then they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>hit with this force in this,</v>

2145
02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:44.990
<v Speaker 1>in this violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it immediately shoves them </v>

2146
02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:44.990
<v Speaker 1>backwards.</v>

2147
02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:49.600
<v Speaker 1>The Germans penetrate the first line of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their defenses in an hour or two.</v>

2148
02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:52.360
<v Speaker 1>They're into the second line of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>defenses by lunchtime.</v>

2149
02:12:52.810 --> 02:12:57.810
<v Speaker 1>This causes the first of several of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call soil your underpants moments that</v>

2150
02:13:00.251 --> 02:13:05.251
<v Speaker 1>are part of the Kaiser Schlock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the multi punch combination of Luton </v>

2151
02:13:05.251 --> 02:13:10.021
<v Speaker 1>doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the second day of the battle </v>

2152
02:13:10.210 --> 02:13:13.840
<v Speaker 1>historian hold your irving says that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting is intense.</v>

2153
02:13:13.841 --> 02:13:17.860
<v Speaker 1>It's hand to hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's it's close combat with grenades and</v>

2154
02:13:17.861 --> 02:13:18.850
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's brutal,</v>

2155
02:13:19.450 --> 02:13:21.010
<v Speaker 1>and he writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

2156
02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:26.790
<v Speaker 1>after two days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ludendorff mobile and attack divisions </v>

2157
02:13:26.790 --> 02:13:30.540
<v Speaker 1>had decimated golf's fifth army and </v>
<v Speaker 1>driven the British almost 40 miles </v>

2158
02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:32.430
<v Speaker 1>behind the song and the croisette canal.</v>

2159
02:13:32.610 --> 02:13:35.580
<v Speaker 4>Haig had lost 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>killed and wounded,</v>

2160
02:13:35.790 --> 02:13:39.510
<v Speaker 4>90,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>prisoners of war and 1300 guns.</v>

2161
02:13:39.750 --> 02:13:42.570
<v Speaker 4>Most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his defenses had been ruptured.</v>

2162
02:13:42.750 --> 02:13:46.590
<v Speaker 4>A 50 mile gap driven through his lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Open field,</v>

2163
02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:51.680
<v Speaker 4>lay ahead of the Germans and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this initial advance has morale </v>

2164
02:13:53.521 --> 02:13:58.521
<v Speaker 4>skyrocketing amongst the Kaiser and some</v>
<v Speaker 4>around him pulled your says,</v>

2165
02:13:59.011 --> 02:13:59.400
<v Speaker 4>quote</v>

2166
02:14:00.550 --> 02:14:01.900
<v Speaker 4>wilhelm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The second rushed,</v>

2167
02:14:01.901 --> 02:14:05.830
<v Speaker 4>congratulations to the troops and </v>
<v Speaker 4>admonish them to push on.</v>

2168
02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:08.030
<v Speaker 4>This is the kaiser talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now quote,</v>

2169
02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:10.540
<v Speaker 4>much has been accomplished,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much more.</v>

2170
02:14:10.541 --> 02:14:14.830
<v Speaker 4>Still remains to be conquered and quote </v>
<v Speaker 4>her vague continues.</v>

2171
02:14:14.831 --> 02:14:19.831
<v Speaker 4>Quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Kaiser ordered schools closed in </v>

2172
02:14:19.831 --> 02:14:22.531
<v Speaker 4>Germany to mark the victory in quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He presented Hindenburg with the Iron </v>

2173
02:14:23.530 --> 02:14:28.530
<v Speaker 4>Cross with golden rays last given to </v>
<v Speaker 4>prince blue shirt for reducing pressure </v>

2174
02:14:28.530 --> 02:14:32.731
<v Speaker 4>of Napoleon and wilhelm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The second informed his entourage over </v>

2175
02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:33.120
<v Speaker 4>champagne.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That quote,</v>

2176
02:14:33.460 --> 02:14:36.250
<v Speaker 4>if an English delegation came to sue for</v>
<v Speaker 4>peace,</v>

2177
02:14:36.370 --> 02:14:41.370
<v Speaker 4>it must kneel before the German standard</v>
<v Speaker 4>for it was a question here of a victory </v>

2178
02:14:41.370 --> 02:14:45.781
<v Speaker 4>of the monarchy over democracy and quote</v>
<v Speaker 4>glutened door for sure at his kaiser </v>

2179
02:14:46.151 --> 02:14:49.060
<v Speaker 4>that the British army had been defeated </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the quote,</v>

2180
02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:55.870
<v Speaker 4>but many in the upper echelons of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germany's military were much more sober </v>

2181
02:14:55.870 --> 02:15:00.701
<v Speaker 4>about what was happening here and </v>
<v Speaker 4>realize that at the pace they were </v>

2182
02:15:00.701 --> 02:15:02.090
<v Speaker 4>getting chewed up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was going to be a problem.</v>

2183
02:15:02.850 --> 02:15:06.060
<v Speaker 4>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was going to break first?</v>

2184
02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:11.420
<v Speaker 4>This is like this boxing match,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which we've compared this entire war to </v>

2185
02:15:11.420 --> 02:15:15.861
<v Speaker 4>throughout this entire series.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have two exhausted fighters here in </v>

2186
02:15:15.861 --> 02:15:15.861
<v Speaker 4>the German high command is kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking,</v>

2187
02:15:15.861 --> 02:15:20.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we really don't have that much left and </v>

2188
02:15:20.690 --> 02:15:20.690
<v Speaker 4>then some of the German high command or </v>
<v Speaker 4>countering with.</v>

2189
02:15:20.690 --> 02:15:21.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but neither do they.</v>

2190
02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:28.340
<v Speaker 4>The fifth army will be forced to pull </v>
<v Speaker 4>back when they pull back.</v>

2191
02:15:28.341 --> 02:15:30.920
<v Speaker 4>The army next to them has to pull back </v>
<v Speaker 4>the third army.</v>

2192
02:15:30.921 --> 02:15:32.900
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise they'll lose contact with each</v>
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

2193
02:15:34.290 --> 02:15:39.290
<v Speaker 4>The problem is is that both these armies</v>
<v Speaker 4>are attached to a French army and this </v>

2194
02:15:39.361 --> 02:15:44.361
<v Speaker 4>is the first crisis that erupts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a breach about to open up </v>

2195
02:15:45.121 --> 02:15:46.740
<v Speaker 4>between the British and the French </v>
<v Speaker 4>armies.</v>

2196
02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:51.860
<v Speaker 4>Splitting those armies would be huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This brings us to what the heck is Luke </v>

2197
02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:54.750
<v Speaker 4>Dorf trying to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2198
02:15:54.751 --> 02:15:57.000
<v Speaker 4>What's his plan here in this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kaiser sherlocked?</v>

2199
02:15:57.390 --> 02:15:59.970
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the big controversies of the</v>

2200
02:15:59.971 --> 02:16:04.971
<v Speaker 4>war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Theoretically he wants to punch a hole </v>

2201
02:16:04.971 --> 02:16:05.520
<v Speaker 4>in the line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>surround the British,</v>

2202
02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:10.640
<v Speaker 4>push the British up like a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>falling dominoes all the way back up to </v>

2203
02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:14.241
<v Speaker 4>the English Channel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thereby changing the entire complexion </v>

2204
02:16:14.241 --> 02:16:15.530
<v Speaker 4>of the war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's flexible.</v>

2205
02:16:16.990 --> 02:16:20.200
<v Speaker 4>He has this saying that has often been </v>
<v Speaker 4>quoted afterwards because this is one of</v>

2206
02:16:20.201 --> 02:16:25.201
<v Speaker 4>the things ludendorff gets the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>critiqued about where he says in terms </v>

2207
02:16:25.201 --> 02:16:28.090
<v Speaker 4>of the strategy and tactics for this big</v>
<v Speaker 4>multi punch combination quote,</v>

2208
02:16:28.420 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 4>we will punch hole and</v>

2209
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:35.010
<v Speaker 1>then we will see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did it that way in Russia and the </v>

2210
02:16:35.010 --> 02:16:38.431
<v Speaker 1>court and he and Hindenburg did kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that when they were commanding the </v>

2211
02:16:38.431 --> 02:16:38.830
<v Speaker 1>eastern front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go in there,</v>

2212
02:16:38.831 --> 02:16:40.910
<v Speaker 1>they'd punch a hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd roll up a Russian army,</v>

2213
02:16:40.911 --> 02:16:45.911
<v Speaker 1>do a bazillion casualties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do that long enough and </v>

2214
02:16:45.911 --> 02:16:47.140
<v Speaker 1>eventually a rickety Russian state falls</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

2215
02:16:47.141 --> 02:16:52.141
<v Speaker 1>But this is France and Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you really sort of gambling that </v>

2216
02:16:52.141 --> 02:16:53.920
<v Speaker 1>you're going to open up this whole and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just going to fall apart?</v>

2217
02:16:54.730 --> 02:16:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Well alluded doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Attitude is that I'm not going to fall </v>

2218
02:16:59.730 --> 02:17:03.091
<v Speaker 1>for the mistakes of my predecessors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people who you know have this one </v>

2219
02:17:03.091 --> 02:17:06.721
<v Speaker 1>place they want to attack and they run </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a brick wall and they just keep </v>

2220
02:17:06.721 --> 02:17:06.940
<v Speaker 1>throwing more troops into the meat </v>
<v Speaker 1>grinder in front of that brick wall.</v>

2221
02:17:06.941 --> 02:17:09.100
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to do that when we break</v>
<v Speaker 1>through somewhere.</v>

2222
02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:14.160
<v Speaker 1>We're going to reinforce success and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is supposed to be part of the </v>

2223
02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:17.821
<v Speaker 1>latest German ideas about the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what happens if the breakthrough </v>

2224
02:17:17.821 --> 02:17:19.600
<v Speaker 1>comes at a spot where there's not that </v>
<v Speaker 1>much of war,</v>

2225
02:17:19.601 --> 02:17:21.950
<v Speaker 1>winning quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2226
02:17:21.951 --> 02:17:26.951
<v Speaker 1>goals anywhere nearby because the bulge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some even call it a breakthrough that </v>

2227
02:17:28.331 --> 02:17:33.331
<v Speaker 1>the Germans have against the British.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifth Army happens at a place where </v>

2228
02:17:33.331 --> 02:17:35.680
<v Speaker 1>there's not anything close by that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to win you the war.</v>

2229
02:17:36.520 --> 02:17:38.110
<v Speaker 1>All those places had been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2230
02:17:38.111 --> 02:17:41.740
<v Speaker 1>extra specially defended by the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>troops in the best defense is the reason</v>

2231
02:17:41.741 --> 02:17:46.060
<v Speaker 1>that the Germans breakthrough here is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there wasn't some very important</v>

2232
02:17:46.061 --> 02:17:51.061
<v Speaker 1>object nearby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Germans are moving so far that </v>

2233
02:17:51.061 --> 02:17:54.991
<v Speaker 1>eventually they run into one a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the roads and railways all come </v>

2234
02:17:54.991 --> 02:17:55.510
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A French city name I'm.</v>

2235
02:17:55.511 --> 02:18:00.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's at this point that something </v>

2236
02:18:00.511 --> 02:18:03.500
<v Speaker 1>that's been an issue for the entire war </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to a,</v>

2237
02:18:04.030 --> 02:18:09.030
<v Speaker 1>an almost fatal head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is the fact that there is no </v>

2238
02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:14.200
<v Speaker 1>coordinated allied leadership at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>because at this point,</v>

2239
02:18:14.410 --> 02:18:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Douglas Haig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British military commander on the </v>

2240
02:18:19.410 --> 02:18:19.410
<v Speaker 1>scene would like help from the French.</v>

2241
02:18:19.410 --> 02:18:23.610
<v Speaker 1>In this crisis situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please send me troops and historians </v>

2242
02:18:23.610 --> 02:18:23.610
<v Speaker 1>have argued about whether or not they </v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

2243
02:18:23.610 --> 02:18:28.591
<v Speaker 1>Some historians nowadays say they not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only did they did it before they were </v>

2244
02:18:28.591 --> 02:18:29.110
<v Speaker 1>even asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they did it in larger numbers.</v>

2245
02:18:29.870 --> 02:18:34.870
<v Speaker 1>They were British historians that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>always said the French were very stingy </v>

2246
02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:37.921
<v Speaker 1>with extra troops and put Hagen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a situation where the worst possible </v>

2247
02:18:37.921 --> 02:18:38.290
<v Speaker 1>thing could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the soil,</v>

2248
02:18:38.291 --> 02:18:43.291
<v Speaker 1>your underpants moment indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Haig was asking for troops from a </v>

2249
02:18:43.721 --> 02:18:45.570
<v Speaker 1>guy named Pataki who had his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>worried.</v>

2250
02:18:45.571 --> 02:18:50.571
<v Speaker 1>He was worried he'd gotten an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence that the Germans had </v>

2251
02:18:50.571 --> 02:18:51.490
<v Speaker 1>another fist that was poised to attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>near Paris,</v>

2252
02:18:51.491 --> 02:18:54.580
<v Speaker 1>and as far as potassium was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was his number one concern.</v>

2253
02:18:55.780 --> 02:19:00.780
<v Speaker 1>There's a meeting on March 26th and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>historians have described Hague's mood </v>

2254
02:19:00.941 --> 02:19:05.941
<v Speaker 1>at this point as near panic as he runs </v>
<v Speaker 1>up against this brick wall where he's </v>

2255
02:19:06.611 --> 02:19:11.611
<v Speaker 1>not getting the kind of help he feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>like he needs and he's in a crisis </v>

2256
02:19:11.611 --> 02:19:11.611
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

2257
02:19:11.611 --> 02:19:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Eric Dorn grows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says quote gaps also opened between the </v>

2258
02:19:16.150 --> 02:19:18.130
<v Speaker 1>British and the French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Across the EU is river sending.</v>

2259
02:19:18.131 --> 02:19:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Hey Gunton near panic as he ordered </v>
<v Speaker 1>trenches dug to protect the channel.</v>

2260
02:19:22.301 --> 02:19:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Ports shifted six divisions from his </v>
<v Speaker 1>northern armies,</v>

2261
02:19:25.331 --> 02:19:30.200
<v Speaker 1>including three from the front line and </v>
<v Speaker 1>implored pitocin to rush 20 divisions.</v>

2262
02:19:30.470 --> 02:19:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Now he's quoting the head of the general</v>
<v Speaker 1>staff.</v>

2263
02:19:32.391 --> 02:19:34.240
<v Speaker 1>The British general staffs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sir Henry Wilson Quote,</v>

2264
02:19:34.460 --> 02:19:38.010
<v Speaker 1>Hague is cowed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said Wilson on March 25th quote.</v>

2265
02:19:38.210 --> 02:19:40.790
<v Speaker 1>He said that unless the whole of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French army came up,</v>

2266
02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:45.940
<v Speaker 1>we were beaten and it would be better to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make peace on any terms we could and the</v>

2267
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:52.270
<v Speaker 1>seriousness of this situation finally </v>
<v Speaker 1>leads the allied Entente powers to </v>

2268
02:19:54.260 --> 02:19:59.260
<v Speaker 1>disregard questions of sovereignty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>jealous guarding of have rights and </v>

2269
02:19:59.260 --> 02:20:03.851
<v Speaker 1>privileges and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally decide to nominate and </v>

2270
02:20:03.851 --> 02:20:07.460
<v Speaker 1>finally approved somebody whose job it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be not so much to be the boss,</v>

2271
02:20:07.461 --> 02:20:12.461
<v Speaker 1>but to be the guy that coordinates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this honor goes to the French </v>

2272
02:20:12.461 --> 02:20:13.010
<v Speaker 1>military leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ferdinand Foshan.</v>

2273
02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:16.340
<v Speaker 1>We had talked about him in an earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode.</v>

2274
02:20:16.430 --> 02:20:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Very aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>energetic,</v>

2275
02:20:19.970 --> 02:20:24.970
<v Speaker 1>brave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the first things he'll do is </v>

2276
02:20:24.970 --> 02:20:28.421
<v Speaker 1>issue an order that says that there will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be no retreat from this important French</v>

2277
02:20:29.180 --> 02:20:31.010
<v Speaker 1>city that Ludendorff is going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>after.</v>

2278
02:20:31.011 --> 02:20:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2279
02:20:32.900 --> 02:20:37.900
<v Speaker 1>that people have to die where they stand</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically not one step back and he will </v>

2280
02:20:38.271 --> 02:20:40.970
<v Speaker 1>dole out the reinforcements as he sees </v>
<v Speaker 1>fit,</v>

2281
02:20:40.971 --> 02:20:45.971
<v Speaker 1>but he's going to be very stingy and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>generals like Haig will think that he's </v>

2282
02:20:45.971 --> 02:20:47.840
<v Speaker 1>stingy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lloyd George,</v>

2283
02:20:47.841 --> 02:20:50.450
<v Speaker 1>the British Prime Minister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writes in his memoir as though that that</v>

2284
02:20:50.451 --> 02:20:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Fascia was being a gambler and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what generals often have to be.</v>

2285
02:20:53.661 --> 02:20:55.670
<v Speaker 1>How often have we said that dwarfs </v>
<v Speaker 1>gambler,</v>

2286
02:20:55.970 --> 02:21:00.970
<v Speaker 1>but would fatia is gambling on is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he can be stingy with these reserves and</v>

2287
02:21:01.071 --> 02:21:06.071
<v Speaker 1>that these generals can manage without </v>
<v Speaker 1>them or manage without what they really </v>

2288
02:21:06.071 --> 02:21:06.071
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

2289
02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:08.720
<v Speaker 1>I Mean Hague's upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't get 20 divisions.</v>

2290
02:21:08.721 --> 02:21:12.320
<v Speaker 1>20 divisions is a huge force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No wonder you can't get 20 division.</v>

2291
02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Fatia is trying to safeguard and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stockpile a reserve force.</v>

2292
02:21:17.901 --> 02:21:20.720
<v Speaker 1>People that could just stay back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay in good health,</v>

2293
02:21:20.721 --> 02:21:22.340
<v Speaker 1>ready to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chomping at the bit,</v>

2294
02:21:22.610 --> 02:21:27.610
<v Speaker 1>and then unleash a counter attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the German offensive is like the </v>

2295
02:21:27.610 --> 02:21:31.631
<v Speaker 1>wave that washes up on the beach and </v>
<v Speaker 1>loses its momentum right before it sinks</v>

2296
02:21:31.761 --> 02:21:34.030
<v Speaker 1>back into the surf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you want to launch a counter</v>

2297
02:21:34.031 --> 02:21:36.290
<v Speaker 1>offensive with fresh troops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the enemy's exhausted,</v>

2298
02:21:36.980 --> 02:21:41.980
<v Speaker 1>what Foshe sees in this multiplex hunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>combination of Luton do offices an </v>

2299
02:21:42.411 --> 02:21:47.411
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to win the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let the Germans punch themselves out </v>

2300
02:21:47.411 --> 02:21:48.830
<v Speaker 1>here and then take it to them with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh force.</v>

2301
02:21:48.831 --> 02:21:53.831
<v Speaker 1>Once they're exhausted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that fresh force can only be built </v>

2302
02:21:53.831 --> 02:21:56.651
<v Speaker 1>by being stingy with reserves when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like Hagar worried that he's </v>

2303
02:21:56.651 --> 02:21:59.711
<v Speaker 1>about to be pushed into the sea and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French and the British were about to </v>

2304
02:21:59.711 --> 02:21:59.830
<v Speaker 1>lose contact and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2305
02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:01.430
<v Speaker 1>middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle part of this front,</v>

2306
02:22:02.600 --> 02:22:04.900
<v Speaker 1>there is desperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2307
02:22:05.180 --> 02:22:05.870
<v Speaker 1>heroic.</v>

2308
02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:08.120
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about some of the fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this battle,</v>

2309
02:22:08.180 --> 02:22:09.440
<v Speaker 1>it's the Kinda thing where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2310
02:22:09.441 --> 02:22:14.150
<v Speaker 1>you have the last four guys with the gun</v>
<v Speaker 1>overrun fighting to the last man to give</v>

2311
02:22:14.151 --> 02:22:15.380
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2312
02:22:15.381 --> 02:22:17.420
<v Speaker 1>another hour of safety while they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2313
02:22:17.421 --> 02:22:20.120
<v Speaker 1>move back to reserve positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2314
02:22:20.121 --> 02:22:22.910
<v Speaker 1>it's really frantic heroic stuff and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans are striving.</v>

2315
02:22:22.911 --> 02:22:27.390
<v Speaker 1>They know this is the war winning or war</v>
<v Speaker 1>losing moment and they're giving it.</v>

2316
02:22:27.391 --> 02:22:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all in the casualties are outrageous.</v>

2317
02:22:31.100 --> 02:22:36.100
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people talk about this time </v>
<v Speaker 1>period as the end of trench warfare in </v>

2318
02:22:36.100 --> 02:22:40.311
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of open warfare again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which hasn't existed on the western </v>

2319
02:22:40.311 --> 02:22:41.400
<v Speaker 1>front since the war started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you had like six months of it and</v>

2320
02:22:41.401 --> 02:22:46.401
<v Speaker 1>the casualties were terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then everything went down </v>

2321
02:22:46.401 --> 02:22:49.970
<v Speaker 1>underground and into the trenches </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was the only way to stay </v>

2322
02:22:49.970 --> 02:22:50.670
<v Speaker 1>alive with all that lead flying up </v>
<v Speaker 1>above,</v>

2323
02:22:51.250 --> 02:22:52.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground level.</v>

2324
02:22:52.680 --> 02:22:55.570
<v Speaker 1>And now we've had reverted to open </v>
<v Speaker 1>warfare again in the troop.</v>

2325
02:22:55.571 --> 02:23:00.571
<v Speaker 1>Seemed happy to be moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is also much more dangerous </v>

2326
02:23:00.571 --> 02:23:01.800
<v Speaker 1>because those trenches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're there for a reason.</v>

2327
02:23:01.801 --> 02:23:06.801
<v Speaker 1>They protected you from the kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties that you're starting to see </v>

2328
02:23:06.801 --> 02:23:08.280
<v Speaker 1>right here at Kaiser Schlock with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>resumption of open warfare.</v>

2329
02:23:08.281 --> 02:23:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Again comes the kind of casualties that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we hadn't seen for awhile.</v>

2330
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Something happens on March 23rd that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2331
02:23:17.370 --> 02:23:22.370
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to put it in a proper context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is people in Paris start </v>

2332
02:23:23.601 --> 02:23:26.720
<v Speaker 1>seeing and hearing explosions out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowhere,</v>

2333
02:23:27.320 --> 02:23:32.320
<v Speaker 1>decent size explosions to and in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting sort of twist.</v>

2334
02:23:33.330 --> 02:23:36.630
<v Speaker 1>The explosion comes with no sound of any</v>
<v Speaker 1>shell or anything.</v>

2335
02:23:36.631 --> 02:23:38.100
<v Speaker 1>There's just nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then boom,</v>

2336
02:23:38.420 --> 02:23:39.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something goes up in smoke</v>

2337
02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:46.320
<v Speaker 1>and it's puzzling for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people in Paris can't figure out </v>

2338
02:23:46.320 --> 02:23:46.320
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were,</v>

2339
02:23:46.320 --> 02:23:50.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are books that talk about this </v>

2340
02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:51.451
<v Speaker 1>where people will be in cafes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speculating on what's causing the </v>

2341
02:23:51.451 --> 02:23:52.540
<v Speaker 1>explosions and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aircraft is what everybody was thinking,</v>

2342
02:23:52.541 --> 02:23:54.910
<v Speaker 1>but the skies were clear and there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>no aircraft.</v>

2343
02:23:55.450 --> 02:24:00.450
<v Speaker 1>And then one of the theories floated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these people in cafes that were </v>

2344
02:24:00.450 --> 02:24:02.410
<v Speaker 1>quoted was that the Germans had somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>smuggled in artillery piece,</v>

2345
02:24:02.710 --> 02:24:07.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>secretly hiding it in some forest or </v>

2346
02:24:07.710 --> 02:24:09.811
<v Speaker 1>something within range of Paris because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was so obviously an artillery piece </v>

2347
02:24:09.811 --> 02:24:10.210
<v Speaker 1>or a bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

2348
02:24:10.780 --> 02:24:15.780
<v Speaker 1>what the French will figure out is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are being shelled from a cannon </v>

2349
02:24:17.470 --> 02:24:22.470
<v Speaker 1>firing from the German side of the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the German side of the line is way </v>

2350
02:24:22.470 --> 02:24:26.230
<v Speaker 1>farther than the range of any other gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>that anyone's ever heard of.</v>

2351
02:24:27.300 --> 02:24:31.070
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that Paris is not being </v>
<v Speaker 1>shelled by one gun,</v>

2352
02:24:31.130 --> 02:24:36.130
<v Speaker 1>but probably multiple guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're called the Paris gun and </v>

2353
02:24:36.130 --> 02:24:39.670
<v Speaker 1>they're being shelled from a distance of</v>
<v Speaker 1>75 miles.</v>

2354
02:24:40.390 --> 02:24:45.390
<v Speaker 1>The gun can reportedly shoot 81 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to give you an idea of how long that</v>

2355
02:24:45.581 --> 02:24:50.581
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the longer range guns you will </v>

2356
02:24:50.581 --> 02:24:52.660
<v Speaker 1>ever run into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the 16 inch guns on the American Iowa</v>

2357
02:24:52.661 --> 02:24:57.160
<v Speaker 1>class battleships and they can shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I recall correctly,</v>

2358
02:24:57.580 --> 02:25:02.580
<v Speaker 1>between 25 and 30 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking about a gun that </v>

2359
02:25:02.580 --> 02:25:07.051
<v Speaker 1>shoots twice as far easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a barrel that is a hundred feet</v>

2360
02:25:08.470 --> 02:25:13.470
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to have a special crane like </v>

2361
02:25:13.470 --> 02:25:13.470
<v Speaker 1>device that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2362
02:25:13.470 --> 02:25:17.200
<v Speaker 1>that sits over the gun and holds the </v>
<v Speaker 1>barrel up and keeps it from drooping.</v>

2363
02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:24.510
<v Speaker 1>The shell that it shoots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am told is the thing that humans ever </v>

2364
02:25:25.631 --> 02:25:30.631
<v Speaker 1>launched into the stratosphere and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distances were so long that the gunners </v>

2365
02:25:31.681 --> 02:25:36.681
<v Speaker 1>had to reportedly account for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rotation of the earth in their </v>

2366
02:25:36.681 --> 02:25:40.641
<v Speaker 1>calculations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But their calculations couldn't be that </v>

2367
02:25:40.641 --> 02:25:45.140
<v Speaker 1>targeted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these people could only shoot it </v>

2368
02:25:45.140 --> 02:25:47.040
<v Speaker 1>cities and that accounts for why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shell sort of landed randomly.</v>

2369
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:52.670
<v Speaker 1>The worst occasion is a is a much talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about still incident during a holiday </v>

2370
02:25:53.161 --> 02:25:58.161
<v Speaker 1>when people were in church and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these shells came crashing through the </v>

2371
02:25:58.161 --> 02:26:01.431
<v Speaker 1>roof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploded in the church and killed like </v>

2372
02:26:01.431 --> 02:26:01.431
<v Speaker 1>80 or 90 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was awful,</v>

2373
02:26:01.540 --> 02:26:06.540
<v Speaker 1>but over the course of the conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would only dish out a little more </v>

2374
02:26:06.540 --> 02:26:08.890
<v Speaker 1>than 800 casualties in less than 300 </v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths,</v>

2375
02:26:08.891 --> 02:26:13.891
<v Speaker 1>which you know isn't wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you have a giant artillery piece </v>

2376
02:26:13.891 --> 02:26:18.061
<v Speaker 1>shelling your city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you would assume worse after </v>

2377
02:26:18.061 --> 02:26:18.910
<v Speaker 1>awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some historians say this is all part</v>

2378
02:26:18.911 --> 02:26:23.260
<v Speaker 1>of a of a concerted effort that what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans are trying to do with their army</v>

2379
02:26:23.261 --> 02:26:28.261
<v Speaker 1>is shock the allies into a pro German </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece and shelling parish as a way of of</v>

2380
02:26:29.680 --> 02:26:32.230
<v Speaker 1>of working the other flank sort of on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2381
02:26:33.800 --> 02:26:37.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm pushing you British armies back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm shelling Paris and believe me,</v>

2382
02:26:37.251 --> 02:26:40.340
<v Speaker 1>it certainly makes clear to the French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stakes involved here.</v>

2383
02:26:40.520 --> 02:26:42.530
<v Speaker 1>The Germans are close enough to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>shelling Paris.</v>

2384
02:26:44.530 --> 02:26:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The key to this battle is going to be </v>

2385
02:26:49.530 --> 02:26:51.130
<v Speaker 1>how the generals utilize the reserves </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have.</v>

2386
02:26:51.131 --> 02:26:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Not to get too technical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2387
02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:57.600
<v Speaker 1>but in this level of warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when troops are fighting each other in </v>

2388
02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:00.451
<v Speaker 1>modern combat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're wearing each other down and </v>

2389
02:27:00.451 --> 02:27:03.151
<v Speaker 1>whittling away their strength and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>generals have at their disposal troops </v>

2390
02:27:03.151 --> 02:27:07.831
<v Speaker 1>that they're holding back and where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>decide to commit those troops as part of</v>

2391
02:27:07.931 --> 02:27:12.931
<v Speaker 1>the art of generalship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of what wins or loses battles </v>

2392
02:27:12.931 --> 02:27:13.600
<v Speaker 1>and it's part of what the generals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>so concerned about.</v>

2393
02:27:13.601 --> 02:27:18.601
<v Speaker 1>When they launched these offensives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least half the offensives half the </v>

2394
02:27:18.601 --> 02:27:21.781
<v Speaker 1>punches we'll throw in Kaiser sherlocked</v>
<v Speaker 1>are nothing but efforts to divert </v>

2395
02:27:22.840 --> 02:27:25.630
<v Speaker 1>reserves from where he really wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>punch,</v>

2396
02:27:27.060 --> 02:27:28.740
<v Speaker 1>but we're alluding to have decided to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

2397
02:27:28.890 --> 02:27:30.120
<v Speaker 1>is to throw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2398
02:27:30.180 --> 02:27:32.940
<v Speaker 1>some of these vital and limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>reserves,</v>

2399
02:27:32.941 --> 02:27:34.950
<v Speaker 1>which are all these wonderful storm </v>
<v Speaker 1>troopers.</v>

2400
02:27:35.460 --> 02:27:36.790
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2401
02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Ernst Junger says they're all kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

2402
02:27:38.701 --> 02:27:42.810
<v Speaker 1>long haired sort of wild man as opposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the sort of buzz cut Germans.</v>

2403
02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:45.240
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to talk about storm </v>
<v Speaker 1>troop culture.</v>

2404
02:27:45.241 --> 02:27:49.350
<v Speaker 1>I had understood them to be members of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the of the best and brightest,</v>

2405
02:27:49.351 --> 02:27:54.351
<v Speaker 1>simply pulled out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but younger makes him sound like some </v>

2406
02:27:54.351 --> 02:27:56.691
<v Speaker 1>sort of ultra cool set of long haired </v>
<v Speaker 1>German viking youngsters or something.</v>

2407
02:27:58.440 --> 02:27:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a ton of them,</v>

2408
02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:01.410
<v Speaker 1>so where are you going to use them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luton.</v>

2409
02:28:01.411 --> 02:28:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Dorf decides to throw them into where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the British army,</v>

2410
02:28:04.021 --> 02:28:09.021
<v Speaker 1>the fifth army and the Third Army where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're bulging back like 40 miles and </v>

2411
02:28:09.021 --> 02:28:10.560
<v Speaker 1>see if you can smash through to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>important railway junction,</v>

2412
02:28:11.780 --> 02:28:16.780
<v Speaker 1>but he runs into the same problems that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the British and the French could have </v>

2413
02:28:16.780 --> 02:28:21.011
<v Speaker 1>warned him about that these first world </v>
<v Speaker 1>war armies run into when they try to </v>

2414
02:28:21.261 --> 02:28:24.440
<v Speaker 1>launch a fences and continue them day </v>
<v Speaker 1>after day after day.</v>

2415
02:28:24.890 --> 02:28:28.010
<v Speaker 1>They simply break down and they break </v>
<v Speaker 1>down on multiple levels.</v>

2416
02:28:29.180 --> 02:28:34.180
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the logistical and supply problems are </v>

2417
02:28:34.180 --> 02:28:36.230
<v Speaker 1>immense and their immense for the armies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that still have a lot of good stuff like</v>

2418
02:28:36.231 --> 02:28:38.930
<v Speaker 1>the British and the French to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans who were down to like,</v>

2419
02:28:39.500 --> 02:28:44.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horses that are underfed and not even </v>

2420
02:28:44.500 --> 02:28:47.231
<v Speaker 1>enough of them to try to move supply up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These battles are huge challenges.</v>

2421
02:28:48.410 --> 02:28:53.410
<v Speaker 1>At one point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these really important German </v>

2422
02:28:53.410 --> 02:28:55.661
<v Speaker 1>armies and sort of ironic ended up </v>
<v Speaker 1>conquering and pushing into the </v>

2423
02:28:55.661 --> 02:29:00.131
<v Speaker 1>territory that they had deliberately </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed in a scorched earth policy to </v>

2424
02:29:01.221 --> 02:29:04.880
<v Speaker 1>hamper their opponents and now they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to operate in it.</v>

2425
02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:10.120
<v Speaker 1>The German army right next door to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>army that moved through the scorched </v>

2426
02:29:10.120 --> 02:29:12.881
<v Speaker 1>earth territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up going through the old som </v>

2427
02:29:12.881 --> 02:29:13.420
<v Speaker 1>battlefield with all its craters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>barbed wire and you know,</v>

2428
02:29:13.660 --> 02:29:15.980
<v Speaker 1>the graveyards of the dead and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2429
02:29:16.220 --> 02:29:18.680
<v Speaker 1>so both these armies were kind of in bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrain.</v>

2430
02:29:18.681 --> 02:29:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Now they're attacking and more and more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2431
02:29:21.111 --> 02:29:26.111
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the allies are resisting heroically and </v>

2432
02:29:26.111 --> 02:29:29.441
<v Speaker 1>the supply is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The German army's starving in some cases</v>

2433
02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:34.370
<v Speaker 1>and you know when you read like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>memoirs of Luton door feel,</v>

2434
02:29:34.371 --> 02:29:35.580
<v Speaker 1>say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well supply.</v>

2435
02:29:35.581 --> 02:29:39.710
<v Speaker 1>I didn't keep up or some little comment </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that as a reason why you know these</v>

2436
02:29:39.711 --> 02:29:44.711
<v Speaker 1>battles bogged down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you actually read accounts of </v>

2437
02:29:44.711 --> 02:29:47.630
<v Speaker 1>what these troops who are desperately </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get the guns and the bullets,</v>

2438
02:29:47.631 --> 02:29:52.120
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly even the food to </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people who are at what they called</v>

2439
02:29:52.121 --> 02:29:54.500
<v Speaker 1>the tip of the spear or the head of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>snake.</v>

2440
02:29:54.500 --> 02:29:59.500
<v Speaker 1>The combat troops are actually fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're being shelled and shot at while </v>

2441
02:29:59.500 --> 02:30:03.410
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They try to overcome supply difficulties</v>

2442
02:30:04.040 --> 02:30:05.870
<v Speaker 1>that once you hear them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sit there and go,</v>

2443
02:30:05.871 --> 02:30:06.740
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a miracle.</v>

2444
02:30:06.741 --> 02:30:11.741
<v Speaker 1>They got as far as they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Historian Alexander Watson has a </v>

2445
02:30:11.901 --> 02:30:16.901
<v Speaker 1>reminiscence by one of these German </v>
<v Speaker 1>supply troops who realizes that winning </v>

2446
02:30:18.171 --> 02:30:21.470
<v Speaker 1>or losing the war requires that they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>their stuff up to the front,</v>

2447
02:30:21.471 --> 02:30:26.471
<v Speaker 1>but listen to what they have to contend </v>
<v Speaker 1>with and then magnify this across an </v>

2448
02:30:27.081 --> 02:30:32.081
<v Speaker 1>entire 40 or 50 mile front as they try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to move forward and continue to keep </v>

2449
02:30:32.091 --> 02:30:36.080
<v Speaker 1>this momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the supply lines get stretched longer</v>

2450
02:30:37.040 --> 02:30:39.380
<v Speaker 1>and the German says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

2451
02:30:40.870 --> 02:30:43.510
<v Speaker 4>I have the feeling that we've been </v>
<v Speaker 4>marching in the wrong direction.</v>

2452
02:30:43.780 --> 02:30:48.780
<v Speaker 4>We asked on several occasions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but don't receive any useful </v>

2453
02:30:48.780 --> 02:30:48.780
<v Speaker 4>information,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in the meantime,</v>

2454
02:30:48.780 --> 02:30:53.581
<v Speaker 4>Tommy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their pet name for the British recall </v>

2455
02:30:53.581 --> 02:30:56.430
<v Speaker 4>begins to shoot and not at all badly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thus right on ahead and come upon too </v>

2456
02:30:56.430 --> 02:31:00.220
<v Speaker 4>recently shot up carts and two dead </v>
<v Speaker 4>horses through a miracle.</v>

2457
02:31:00.221 --> 02:31:05.221
<v Speaker 4>The driver remains unhurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They warned us that we should not drive </v>

2458
02:31:05.221 --> 02:31:08.911
<v Speaker 4>past for in front it's hell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what can you do therefore forwards?</v>

2459
02:31:09.490 --> 02:31:10.300
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>however,</v>

2460
02:31:10.301 --> 02:31:15.301
<v Speaker 4>the way begins to get bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thick mud makes forward progress </v>

2461
02:31:15.301 --> 02:31:19.081
<v Speaker 4>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And soon we have a supply column stuck </v>

2462
02:31:19.081 --> 02:31:21.811
<v Speaker 4>fast in front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A Saxon bridging unit cannot go any </v>

2463
02:31:21.811 --> 02:31:23.430
<v Speaker 4>further.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It approaches us and gets stuck.</v>

2464
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:26.160
<v Speaker 4>We therefore harness the horses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>push,</v>

2465
02:31:26.310 --> 02:31:28.980
<v Speaker 4>make room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unload the bridging unit stuff,</v>

2466
02:31:29.010 --> 02:31:31.770
<v Speaker 4>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all in the deepest darkness and with the</v>

2467
02:31:31.771 --> 02:31:33.120
<v Speaker 4>least possible noise.</v>

2468
02:31:33.420 --> 02:31:35.760
<v Speaker 4>In addition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the shells crash around,</v>

2469
02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:39.120
<v Speaker 4>but one no longer worries about them </v>
<v Speaker 4>after much effort,</v>

2470
02:31:39.121 --> 02:31:44.121
<v Speaker 4>the wagons or got back on the road and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we think now the comrade in his column </v>

2471
02:31:44.121 --> 02:31:48.650
<v Speaker 4>who missed their way can go on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no just then a narrow gauge train </v>

2472
02:31:49.471 --> 02:31:54.471
<v Speaker 4>comes rushing along.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Irresponsible chaps have thrown </v>

2473
02:31:54.471 --> 02:31:57.681
<v Speaker 4>munitions on the rails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One jolt and the train is derailed on </v>

2474
02:31:57.681 --> 02:32:01.911
<v Speaker 4>exactly that street along which we have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to pass what to do with unspeakable </v>

2475
02:32:02.371 --> 02:32:04.950
<v Speaker 4>effort to munitions which are jammed at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the front,</v>

2476
02:32:04.951 --> 02:32:07.980
<v Speaker 4>are removed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The derailed carriage is lifted by means</v>

2477
02:32:07.981 --> 02:32:12.981
<v Speaker 4>of a winch and then the route is free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the vehicles can get through and </v>

2478
02:32:12.981 --> 02:32:17.151
<v Speaker 4>they start up again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We then come to the worst part of the </v>

2479
02:32:17.151 --> 02:32:20.301
<v Speaker 4>road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thick clay allows us to go forward only </v>

2480
02:32:20.301 --> 02:32:22.560
<v Speaker 4>gradually at every moment a wagon and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's driver gets stuck.</v>

2481
02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:27.800
<v Speaker 4>Reserved teams are sent forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bridges over streams are especially </v>

2482
02:32:27.800 --> 02:32:29.670
<v Speaker 4>difficult to cross and on top of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're under heavy fire</v>

2483
02:32:30.170 --> 02:32:35.170
<v Speaker 1>and to quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that the troops aren't </v>

2484
02:32:35.170 --> 02:32:39.931
<v Speaker 1>getting supplies becomes part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why they can't continue to push </v>

2485
02:32:39.931 --> 02:32:44.371
<v Speaker 1>on at the pace that the German high </v>
<v Speaker 1>command wants them to push on the pace </v>

2486
02:32:44.371 --> 02:32:46.330
<v Speaker 1>that they're going to have to push on if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to achieve these objectives.</v>

2487
02:32:47.940 --> 02:32:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Princess Evelyn blue shirt or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>English wife of the German nobleman who </v>

2488
02:32:52.940 --> 02:32:56.630
<v Speaker 1>quoted a few times before as a story </v>
<v Speaker 1>about letters that their family was </v>

2489
02:32:57.151 --> 02:33:02.151
<v Speaker 1>receiving from family members who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>in these battles and when you read them,</v>

2490
02:33:03.270 --> 02:33:08.270
<v Speaker 1>you hear about an army that is literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>starving and exhausted.</v>

2491
02:33:10.110 --> 02:33:10.980
<v Speaker 1>She writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

2492
02:33:12.850 --> 02:33:16.870
<v Speaker 4>they say that no words can describe the </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrors of what they've been through.</v>

2493
02:33:17.110 --> 02:33:19.660
<v Speaker 4>They write that they're almost dying of </v>
<v Speaker 4>starvation.</v>

2494
02:33:19.870 --> 02:33:23.710
<v Speaker 4>They say they advanced so rapidly that </v>
<v Speaker 4>no provisions could reach them and their</v>

2495
02:33:23.711 --> 02:33:28.711
<v Speaker 4>division was five days and nights </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting incessantly without food or </v>

2496
02:33:28.711 --> 02:33:32.851
<v Speaker 4>even sleep at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And those of their companies who were </v>

2497
02:33:32.851 --> 02:33:33.340
<v Speaker 4>not killed or wounded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>died of exhaustion.</v>

2498
02:33:33.550 --> 02:33:37.390
<v Speaker 4>And it is only by a miracle that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves are left to tell the tale.</v>

2499
02:33:37.630 --> 02:33:39.850
<v Speaker 4>There letter ends with the significant </v>
<v Speaker 4>words,</v>

2500
02:33:39.880 --> 02:33:44.880
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>send us some food somehow as quickly as </v>

2501
02:33:44.880 --> 02:33:44.880
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or we also show them</v>

2502
02:33:44.900 --> 02:33:46.970
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>End Quote.</v>

2503
02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:52.040
<v Speaker 1>She then comments about the situation in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little village where she lives,</v>

2504
02:33:52.850 --> 02:33:56.390
<v Speaker 4>the peasants and village people received</v>
<v Speaker 4>the news that sometimes one,</v>

2505
02:33:56.570 --> 02:33:59.930
<v Speaker 4>sometimes even two of their sons had </v>
<v Speaker 4>been killed on the same day.</v>

2506
02:34:00.140 --> 02:34:01.490
<v Speaker 4>It has been wholesale slaughter</v>

2507
02:34:01.550 --> 02:34:06.300
<v Speaker 1>of light and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Given that situation,</v>

2508
02:34:06.900 --> 02:34:11.900
<v Speaker 1>it's not hard to understand how once </v>
<v Speaker 1>these troops began to push forward into </v>

2509
02:34:14.910 --> 02:34:19.910
<v Speaker 1>allied controlled area and see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>supply dumps and the stores and all </v>

2510
02:34:22.511 --> 02:34:24.070
<v Speaker 1>these things that the allied troops </v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

2511
02:34:24.071 --> 02:34:25.360
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you read their accounts,</v>

2512
02:34:25.390 --> 02:34:28.150
<v Speaker 1>they think they were suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2513
02:34:28.151 --> 02:34:33.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading one where the guy </v>

2514
02:34:33.151 --> 02:34:33.151
<v Speaker 1>said British soldier saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2515
02:34:33.151 --> 02:34:33.730
<v Speaker 1>we're eating dog biscuits were </v>
<v Speaker 1>practically starving,</v>

2516
02:34:34.210 --> 02:34:37.870
<v Speaker 1>but these Germans come across with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>British forces have.</v>

2517
02:34:38.770 --> 02:34:43.770
<v Speaker 1>And they just stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some cases Gj Meyer quotes a famous </v>

2518
02:34:44.101 --> 02:34:44.610
<v Speaker 1>piece</v>

2519
02:34:45.930 --> 02:34:50.930
<v Speaker 1>about a soldier investigating why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>advance wasn't moving forward.</v>

2520
02:34:51.780 --> 02:34:56.320
<v Speaker 1>A German captain writing about events on</v>
<v Speaker 1>March 26th St.</v>

2521
02:34:56.410 --> 02:35:01.410
<v Speaker 1>quote today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the advance of our infantry stopped </v>

2522
02:35:01.410 --> 02:35:01.410
<v Speaker 1>nearer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll bear.</v>

2523
02:35:01.410 --> 02:35:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Nobody could understand why our airmen </v>
<v Speaker 1>had reported no enemy between our bear.</v>

2524
02:35:04.830 --> 02:35:05.520
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2525
02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:09.570
<v Speaker 1>the enemy's guns were only firing now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and again on the very edge of affairs.</v>

2526
02:35:09.780 --> 02:35:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Our way seemed entirely clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I jumped into a car with orders to find </v>

2527
02:35:14.780 --> 02:35:16.080
<v Speaker 1>out what was causing the stoppage at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>front.</v>

2528
02:35:16.500 --> 02:35:20.100
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I got near the town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I began to see curious sites,</v>

2529
02:35:20.370 --> 02:35:25.370
<v Speaker 1>strange figures who looked very little </v>
<v Speaker 1>like soldiers and certainly showed no </v>

2530
02:35:25.370 --> 02:35:27.510
<v Speaker 1>signs of advancing were making their way</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

2531
02:35:27.750 --> 02:35:30.890
<v Speaker 1>There were men driving cows before them </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a line.</v>

2532
02:35:31.140 --> 02:35:36.140
<v Speaker 1>Others who carried a hen under one arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a box of note paper under the other </v>

2533
02:35:36.140 --> 02:35:38.220
<v Speaker 1>men carrying a bottle of wine under </v>
<v Speaker 1>their arm.</v>

2534
02:35:38.220 --> 02:35:42.450
<v Speaker 1>And another one opened in their hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man who had torn a silk drawing room,</v>

2535
02:35:42.451 --> 02:35:47.451
<v Speaker 1>curtain Rod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're dragging it to the rear as a </v>

2536
02:35:47.451 --> 02:35:49.590
<v Speaker 1>useful piece of loot men with writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper and colored notebooks.</v>

2537
02:35:49.591 --> 02:35:54.591
<v Speaker 1>Evidently they'd founded desirable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sack a or shop men dressed up in comic </v>

2538
02:35:55.201 --> 02:35:58.140
<v Speaker 1>disguise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men with top hats on their heads,</v>

2539
02:35:58.320 --> 02:36:01.290
<v Speaker 1>men staggering men who could hardly </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk.</v>

2540
02:36:01.530 --> 02:36:06.530
<v Speaker 1>When I got into the town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the streets were running with wine out </v>

2541
02:36:06.530 --> 02:36:09.831
<v Speaker 1>of a seller came a lieutenant of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second marine division helpless and in </v>

2542
02:36:09.831 --> 02:36:11.550
<v Speaker 1>despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked him what is going to happen?</v>

2543
02:36:11.700 --> 02:36:13.500
<v Speaker 1>It was essential for them to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

2544
02:36:13.501 --> 02:36:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He replied solemnly and emphatically.</v>

2545
02:36:16.890 --> 02:36:21.090
<v Speaker 1>I cannot get my men out of the seller </v>
<v Speaker 1>without bloodshed and to quote,</v>

2546
02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:25.980
<v Speaker 1>but in addition to the logistical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>supply exhaustion,</v>

2547
02:36:25.981 --> 02:36:30.981
<v Speaker 1>there's another kind of exhaustion that </v>
<v Speaker 1>plays into all these world war one </v>

2548
02:36:30.981 --> 02:36:34.101
<v Speaker 1>offensives and it's human exhaustion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the part where human beings simply </v>

2549
02:36:35.021 --> 02:36:37.350
<v Speaker 1>come to the end of their limit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2550
02:36:37.370 --> 02:36:42.370
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you can fight a battle the way you </v>

2551
02:36:42.370 --> 02:36:42.370
<v Speaker 1>want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you rotate people out.</v>

2552
02:36:42.370 --> 02:36:44.620
<v Speaker 1>So after a unit is so tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not useful anymore,</v>

2553
02:36:44.820 --> 02:36:49.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take them out of the line and you </v>

2554
02:36:49.820 --> 02:36:49.820
<v Speaker 1>replace them by fresh troops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in these battles,</v>

2555
02:36:49.820 --> 02:36:51.010
<v Speaker 1>and especially on the German side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was very difficult to do</v>

2556
02:36:52.140 --> 02:36:55.770
<v Speaker 1>and they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the same troops are fighting for days</v>

2557
02:36:55.771 --> 02:36:57.690
<v Speaker 1>and they're dropping where they stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2558
02:36:58.050 --> 02:36:59.630
<v Speaker 1>if you believe the princess blue shirt </v>
<v Speaker 1>letter,</v>

2559
02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:01.110
<v Speaker 1>they're dying from exhaustion,</v>

2560
02:37:03.010 --> 02:37:07.900
<v Speaker 1>but if you think about how being this </v>
<v Speaker 1>tired affects your ability to resist and</v>

2561
02:37:07.901 --> 02:37:12.901
<v Speaker 1>your willingness to continue onward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're sitting in the comfort of </v>

2562
02:37:13.061 --> 02:37:17.960
<v Speaker 1>our recording studio here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed by these people's ability to</v>

2563
02:37:17.961 --> 02:37:22.961
<v Speaker 1>put up with the shelling and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions and the dead bodies and all </v>

2564
02:37:22.961 --> 02:37:26.750
<v Speaker 1>that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's when you think of them having</v>

2565
02:37:26.751 --> 02:37:31.751
<v Speaker 1>a full belly and a good night's sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine it when you haven't slept in </v>

2566
02:37:31.751 --> 02:37:35.840
<v Speaker 1>days and you're starving to death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Second World War.</v>

2567
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Some of these armies will sometimes use </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like amphetamines to prolong the </v>

2568
02:37:40.990 --> 02:37:44.330
<v Speaker 1>amount of time people could endure </v>
<v Speaker 1>before they hit the exhaustion point.</v>

2569
02:37:44.750 --> 02:37:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it blamed by some historians </v>
<v Speaker 1>for some of the more infamous massacres.</v>

2570
02:37:49.370 --> 02:37:52.550
<v Speaker 1>You have troops that had been up for 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>days straight using speed.</v>

2571
02:37:52.880 --> 02:37:57.880
<v Speaker 1>They might not be as rational or as I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>collected as,</v>

2572
02:37:58.641 --> 02:38:00.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might've been 12 days previously.</v>

2573
02:38:03.810 --> 02:38:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm part of why these exhausted soldiers</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't able to force anything to a </v>

2574
02:38:08.810 --> 02:38:10.350
<v Speaker 1>conclusion that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're moving forward.</v>

2575
02:38:10.470 --> 02:38:12.450
<v Speaker 1>They've been successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been reinforced.</v>

2576
02:38:13.020 --> 02:38:16.440
<v Speaker 1>But they don't have any mobility </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout all of human history.</v>

2577
02:38:16.441 --> 02:38:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Cavalry had sort of played the role of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they needed.</v>

2578
02:38:19.651 --> 02:38:24.651
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that could rush forward and </v>

2579
02:38:24.651 --> 02:38:26.871
<v Speaker 1>attack retreating or troops who are at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least pulling back really so you know </v>

2580
02:38:26.871 --> 02:38:31.430
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of chaos in the enemy rear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Germans need tanks and they need </v>

2581
02:38:31.430 --> 02:38:34.890
<v Speaker 1>armored personnel carriers and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't have it for another world war.</v>

2582
02:38:36.030 --> 02:38:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Their opponents do have these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They unveiled the tank a year before </v>

2583
02:38:41.030 --> 02:38:45.741
<v Speaker 1>this time period and they've become </v>
<v Speaker 1>better and are getting continually </v>

2584
02:38:45.741 --> 02:38:49.821
<v Speaker 1>better at figuring out how to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Initially the German high command had </v>

2585
02:38:49.821 --> 02:38:53.721
<v Speaker 1>scoffed at this whole tank idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're taking it more and more </v>

2586
02:38:53.721 --> 02:38:53.721
<v Speaker 1>seriously as time goes on.</v>

2587
02:38:53.730 --> 02:38:58.730
<v Speaker 1>They wish they had some tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I bet because these exhausted </v>

2588
02:38:58.730 --> 02:39:01.821
<v Speaker 1>soldiers are only able to march forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>historian John Terraine considers this </v>

2589
02:39:02.041 --> 02:39:07.041
<v Speaker 1>to have been almost criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the German high command launches </v>

2590
02:39:07.041 --> 02:39:11.811
<v Speaker 1>these offensives to win the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't give the troops any way to </v>

2591
02:39:11.811 --> 02:39:11.811
<v Speaker 1>exploit their victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2592
02:39:11.811 --> 02:39:14.190
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the year would show,</v>

2593
02:39:14.370 --> 02:39:18.420
<v Speaker 1>the days of cavalry is an arm of </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploitation on the modern battlefield.</v>

2594
02:39:18.421 --> 02:39:23.340
<v Speaker 1>We're over yet feeble as it was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cavalry was the only exploiting arm that</v>

2595
02:39:23.341 --> 02:39:28.341
<v Speaker 1>existed for the Germans to launch an </v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive intended to win the war with </v>

2596
02:39:28.341 --> 02:39:32.250
<v Speaker 1>none at all was not just foolish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was criminal end quote,</v>

2597
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:38.000
<v Speaker 1>and it would allow the enemy to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>reserves and help,</v>

2598
02:39:38.001 --> 02:39:43.001
<v Speaker 1>and the French have unleashed divisions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of troops that come to the aid to and </v>

2599
02:39:43.001 --> 02:39:45.950
<v Speaker 1>the resistance of the allies will </v>
<v Speaker 1>stiffen heroically,</v>

2600
02:39:46.150 --> 02:39:51.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of this important railway </v>

2601
02:39:51.150 --> 02:39:51.260
<v Speaker 1>juncture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Germans would run out of gas.</v>

2602
02:39:51.270 --> 02:39:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would be like that wave that lost </v>

2603
02:39:56.270 --> 02:39:59.081
<v Speaker 1>the momentum at the end of the beach and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luton Dorf years later.</v>

2604
02:39:59.901 --> 02:40:04.901
<v Speaker 1>Writing in his memoir is about what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows is this important moment in his </v>

2605
02:40:04.901 --> 02:40:05.960
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany's history,</v>

2606
02:40:05.961 --> 02:40:10.961
<v Speaker 1>world history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that he's been criticized for a ton </v>

2607
02:40:10.961 --> 02:40:12.440
<v Speaker 1>and here's the way he puts it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In his memoirs,</v>

2608
02:40:12.441 --> 02:40:16.320
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the enemy's line was now becoming denser</v>

2609
02:40:16.470 --> 02:40:19.050
<v Speaker 1>and in places they were even attacking </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

2610
02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:22.140
<v Speaker 1>While our armies were no longer strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to overcome them,</v>

2611
02:40:22.141 --> 02:40:26.550
<v Speaker 1>unaided the ammunition was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient and supply became difficult.</v>

2612
02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:31.760
<v Speaker 1>The repair of roads and railways was </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking too long in spite of all of our </v>

2613
02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:35.241
<v Speaker 1>preparations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You then goes on to say it was an </v>

2614
02:40:35.241 --> 02:40:39.381
<v Speaker 1>established fact that the enemy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance was beyond our strength and </v>

2615
02:40:39.570 --> 02:40:44.570
<v Speaker 1>quote on April Fifth Ludendorff calls </v>
<v Speaker 1>off Operation Michael.</v>

2616
02:40:48.170 --> 02:40:53.170
<v Speaker 1>He's inflicted 178,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties on the British Bam in 15 </v>

2617
02:40:53.871 --> 02:40:57.150
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>77,000</v>

2618
02:40:57.180 --> 02:41:02.180
<v Speaker 1>on the French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he suffered between 230 and 250,000</v>

2619
02:41:03.171 --> 02:41:08.171
<v Speaker 1>casualties himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a man who launched this whole attack</v>

2620
02:41:08.780 --> 02:41:13.780
<v Speaker 1>out of a fear that American </v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforcements were going to come and </v>

2621
02:41:13.780 --> 02:41:16.751
<v Speaker 1>swamp the Germans through sheer numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't trade lives at this rate and </v>

2622
02:41:16.751 --> 02:41:18.610
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alluded.</v>

2623
02:41:18.620 --> 02:41:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Dorf knows that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's going to continue to punch </v>

2624
02:41:23.620 --> 02:41:26.861
<v Speaker 1>because that's his plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's hoping to land a clean shot </v>

2625
02:41:26.861 --> 02:41:26.861
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>

2626
02:41:28.610 --> 02:41:31.610
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that there was so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>invested in Michael.</v>

2627
02:41:32.510 --> 02:41:35.420
<v Speaker 1>These offenses that had been planned for</v>
<v Speaker 1>months always do the best.</v>

2628
02:41:35.421 --> 02:41:37.700
<v Speaker 1>The troops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morale was always at its highest.</v>

2629
02:41:39.930 --> 02:41:44.930
<v Speaker 1>The failure was disheartening and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead on the German side come </v>

2630
02:41:44.930 --> 02:41:48.660
<v Speaker 1>disproportionately from their very best </v>
<v Speaker 1>handpicked troops.</v>

2631
02:41:50.490 --> 02:41:55.490
<v Speaker 1>When you decide to use most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rocket fuel and the very first punch,</v>

2632
02:41:55.561 --> 02:41:58.050
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a ton left for subsequent</v>
<v Speaker 1>punches,</v>

2633
02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:03.090
<v Speaker 1>and at this point Luton door starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting really pointed,</v>

2634
02:42:03.091 --> 02:42:06.540
<v Speaker 1>not so nice questions from subordinates </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what's he thinking here?</v>

2635
02:42:06.930 --> 02:42:11.930
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of Lewd and door staff is turning </v>

2636
02:42:12.451 --> 02:42:17.451
<v Speaker 1>against him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're openly questioning his decision </v>

2637
02:42:17.451 --> 02:42:21.741
<v Speaker 1>making in these situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least one of [inaudible] responses to</v>

2638
02:42:21.961 --> 02:42:26.961
<v Speaker 1>his rebellious staff members made it </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the history books he supposed to </v>

2639
02:42:26.961 --> 02:42:29.660
<v Speaker 1>have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one historian described it as acidly</v>

2640
02:42:30.270 --> 02:42:33.840
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the purpose of your croaking?</v>

2641
02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:39.320
<v Speaker 1>What do you want from me and my now to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclude peace at any price and quote,</v>

2642
02:42:41.070 --> 02:42:45.960
<v Speaker 1>they'll hum von Liebig who will be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>field marshal in the next world.</v>

2643
02:42:45.961 --> 02:42:50.961
<v Speaker 1>War is openly critical of Luton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dorff and then says that on March 30,</v>

2644
02:42:51.841 --> 02:42:55.350
<v Speaker 1>first he totally lost his nerves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

2645
02:42:56.340 --> 02:43:01.290
<v Speaker 1>this is sorta the way they described a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous breakdown back then,</v>

2646
02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:06.920
<v Speaker 1>and if Ludendorff had had one here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he may have had another one or he may </v>

2647
02:43:08.011 --> 02:43:13.011
<v Speaker 1>have had the first one later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is going to be an increasingly </v>

2648
02:43:13.011 --> 02:43:15.280
<v Speaker 1>period ahead for Luton Dorff and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>already showing signs of cracking.</v>

2649
02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:20.280
<v Speaker 1>If he'd had one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that would just put him as the </v>

2650
02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:23.100
<v Speaker 1>second German military leader in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>war to have a nervous breakdown.</v>

2651
02:43:23.110 --> 02:43:28.110
<v Speaker 1>The original architect who had to carry </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the plan to win the war at the very </v>

2652
02:43:28.110 --> 02:43:28.110
<v Speaker 1>start of the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have on mold.</v>

2653
02:43:28.110 --> 02:43:33.070
<v Speaker 1>He also lost his nerves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you say to yourself,</v>

2654
02:43:33.071 --> 02:43:35.320
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does it matter?</v>

2655
02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:40.920
<v Speaker 1>But if gluten Dorf is still basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy making all these decisions on </v>

2656
02:43:40.920 --> 02:43:45.120
<v Speaker 1>what to do with all these punches and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to react when opportunities are </v>

2657
02:43:45.120 --> 02:43:47.380
<v Speaker 1>crises erupt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his state of mind is key and if it isn't</v>

2658
02:43:47.381 --> 02:43:50.350
<v Speaker 1>clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's his decision making going to be?</v>

2659
02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:55.810
<v Speaker 1>It gets questioned increasingly as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue onward.</v>

2660
02:43:55.811 --> 02:44:00.370
<v Speaker 1>The Second Punch arrives on April ninth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so right after Michael is called off,</v>

2661
02:44:00.670 --> 02:44:03.340
<v Speaker 1>they launched Georgette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of these punches,</v>

2662
02:44:03.341 --> 02:44:04.600
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has its own name.</v>

2663
02:44:04.690 --> 02:44:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Georgette was supposed to be George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's been scaled back,</v>

2664
02:44:07.841 --> 02:44:12.841
<v Speaker 1>hence Georgette,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the huge losses that the </v>

2665
02:44:12.841 --> 02:44:13.930
<v Speaker 1>first punch cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans,</v>

2666
02:44:14.800 --> 02:44:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Georgette is launched in the north in </v>
<v Speaker 1>flanders against in a really strong </v>

2667
02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:21.040
<v Speaker 1>defenses where they've been fighting for</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2668
02:44:21.580 --> 02:44:24.220
<v Speaker 1>These defenses had been weakened </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat though because when the Germans</v>

2669
02:44:24.221 --> 02:44:26.180
<v Speaker 1>were busy throwing their first punch </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hagen,</v>

2670
02:44:26.210 --> 02:44:31.210
<v Speaker 1>the British were rushing every unit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could spare down to where the </v>

2671
02:44:31.210 --> 02:44:32.440
<v Speaker 1>fighting was and a bunch of those units </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been up here in Flanders.</v>

2672
02:44:32.800 --> 02:44:35.260
<v Speaker 1>A lot of what Ludendorff is going to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with these punches,</v>

2673
02:44:35.740 --> 02:44:37.470
<v Speaker 1>as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr,</v>

2674
02:44:37.560 --> 02:44:40.180
<v Speaker 1>create diversions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be the equivalent in a boxing match</v>

2675
02:44:40.181 --> 02:44:43.780
<v Speaker 1>of throwing a punch at someone's body to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get them to pull their hands down,</v>

2676
02:44:43.870 --> 02:44:46.510
<v Speaker 1>opening up their head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go to another punch.</v>

2677
02:44:47.470 --> 02:44:49.960
<v Speaker 1>This is where Ludina Dorf really wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to win the war though,</v>

2678
02:44:49.961 --> 02:44:52.240
<v Speaker 1>because up in the north here in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Flanders,</v>

2679
02:44:52.241 --> 02:44:57.241
<v Speaker 1>his goal are the channel ports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These ports right on the other side of </v>

2680
02:44:57.241 --> 02:44:59.890
<v Speaker 1>the English Channel from Great Britain </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are supplying everything,</v>

2681
02:44:59.891 --> 02:45:03.220
<v Speaker 1>the entire British army and in fact all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the stuff that they're bringing in,</v>

2682
02:45:03.640 --> 02:45:08.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to share with the French and everything </v>

2683
02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:08.640
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a key area.</v>

2684
02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows it and when Georgette </v>
<v Speaker 1>strikes,</v>

2685
02:45:09.610 --> 02:45:10.490
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luton,</v>

2686
02:45:10.491 --> 02:45:15.491
<v Speaker 1>Doris got foggy weather helping him out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and once again he somehow strikes units </v>

2687
02:45:15.491 --> 02:45:16.990
<v Speaker 1>that are just shouldn't be in the line </v>
<v Speaker 1>of fire.</v>

2688
02:45:16.991 --> 02:45:20.740
<v Speaker 1>They were actually moved to what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought was a quiet part of the line and</v>

2689
02:45:20.741 --> 02:45:25.741
<v Speaker 1>then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have another German hurricane </v>

2690
02:45:25.741 --> 02:45:27.511
<v Speaker 1>bombardment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have still some storm troopers left </v>

2691
02:45:27.511 --> 02:45:29.350
<v Speaker 1>who were pursuing through this fog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a poor Portuguese division.</v>

2692
02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:33.160
<v Speaker 1>This is truly becoming a world war now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're supposed to be leaving.</v>

2693
02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:38.160
<v Speaker 1>The front that day gets just </v>
<v Speaker 1>disintegrates in front of the artillery </v>

2694
02:45:38.321 --> 02:45:40.480
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A British unit pulls back and you have a</v>

2695
02:45:40.481 --> 02:45:44.590
<v Speaker 1>very similar situation to exactly how </v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael started this German penetration,</v>

2696
02:45:44.710 --> 02:45:49.710
<v Speaker 1>another soil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your underpants moment when Haig once </v>

2697
02:45:49.710 --> 02:45:53.101
<v Speaker 1>again pleads for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No help from the French and he gets </v>

2698
02:45:53.101 --> 02:45:55.690
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's sort of stingy in his mind.</v>

2699
02:45:55.691 --> 02:46:00.691
<v Speaker 1>How much he gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember Fatia squirreling away troops </v>

2700
02:46:00.691 --> 02:46:03.811
<v Speaker 1>for this counterattack he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>launch when the Germans are totally </v>

2701
02:46:03.811 --> 02:46:06.781
<v Speaker 1>punched out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he has to gamble that he can be </v>

2702
02:46:06.781 --> 02:46:08.500
<v Speaker 1>stingy with troops and not have Haig </v>
<v Speaker 1>fold up.</v>

2703
02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:11.630
<v Speaker 1>No one knows whether or not that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

2704
02:46:11.810 --> 02:46:16.810
<v Speaker 1>Haig issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his most famous speeches or </v>

2705
02:46:16.810 --> 02:46:17.210
<v Speaker 1>proclamations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you would say,</v>

2706
02:46:17.211 --> 02:46:22.211
<v Speaker 1>it's called the backs to the wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>proclamation and it is literally one of </v>

2707
02:46:22.211 --> 02:46:25.250
<v Speaker 1>those stand or die orders to the troops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very famous,</v>

2708
02:46:25.251 --> 02:46:29.690
<v Speaker 1>very stirring and rousing when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation is grim quote.</v>

2709
02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Many amongst us are now tired to those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that victory will belong to </v>

2710
02:46:35.230 --> 02:46:39.530
<v Speaker 1>the side which holds out the longest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The French army is moving rapidly and in</v>

2711
02:46:39.531 --> 02:46:43.070
<v Speaker 1>great force to our support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no other course open to watch,</v>

2712
02:46:43.071 --> 02:46:48.071
<v Speaker 1>but to fight it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every position must be held to the last </v>

2713
02:46:48.071 --> 02:46:51.581
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There must be no retirement with our </v>

2714
02:46:51.581 --> 02:46:52.730
<v Speaker 1>backs to the wall and believing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice of our cause.</v>

2715
02:46:52.880 --> 02:46:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Each one of us must fight onto the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The safety of our homes and the freedom </v>

2716
02:46:57.880 --> 02:47:02.471
<v Speaker 1>of man kind of like depends upon the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conduct of each one of us at this </v>

2717
02:47:02.471 --> 02:47:05.940
<v Speaker 1>critical moment in the quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless.</v>

2718
02:47:06.450 --> 02:47:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doodoo,</v>

2719
02:47:07.260 --> 02:47:12.260
<v Speaker 1>ferocious resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to think of both sides </v>

2720
02:47:12.260 --> 02:47:15.261
<v Speaker 1>is absolutely straining to the maximum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British and the French are able to </v>

2721
02:47:15.691 --> 02:47:16.980
<v Speaker 1>hold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>

2722
02:47:18.410 --> 02:47:22.670
<v Speaker 1>the logistical supplies and the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhaustion and the casualty levels,</v>

2723
02:47:23.080 --> 02:47:28.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy the momentum of the German </v>

2724
02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:28.080
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2725
02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:28.080
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a mirror image.</v>

2726
02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:34.760
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing that the allies have</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to face the last couple of years </v>

2727
02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:36.540
<v Speaker 1>when they tried to launch a fences and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then continue to maintain the momentum.</v>

2728
02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Georgette gets to within five miles of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>key objective and both sides by the way.</v>

2729
02:47:46.791 --> 02:47:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be mind numbing.</v>

2730
02:47:48.681 --> 02:47:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Suffer another 110,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties each.</v>

2731
02:47:53.030 --> 02:47:54.560
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get your mind around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

2732
02:47:54.561 --> 02:47:55.520
<v Speaker 1>I always think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2733
02:47:55.521 --> 02:48:00.521
<v Speaker 1>you figure 50 to 60,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people fill up your average sports </v>

2734
02:48:00.521 --> 02:48:01.310
<v Speaker 1>stadium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're a hundred and 10,000</v>

2735
02:48:01.311 --> 02:48:02.930
<v Speaker 1>number is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2736
02:48:02.931 --> 02:48:05.780
<v Speaker 1>a couple of sports stadiums and George </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet by the way is small.</v>

2737
02:48:05.810 --> 02:48:09.880
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's named Georgette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big encounters are giving you,</v>

2738
02:48:09.970 --> 02:48:13.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multi hundreds of thousands of people on</v>

2739
02:48:13.971 --> 02:48:16.670
<v Speaker 1>May 27th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost a month later.</v>

2740
02:48:16.910 --> 02:48:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Luton door throws the third punch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a month later because it took that </v>

2741
02:48:21.910 --> 02:48:26.051
<v Speaker 1>long to in a refit and reorganize and </v>
<v Speaker 1>send replacements and have people in the</v>

2742
02:48:26.961 --> 02:48:30.170
<v Speaker 1>hospital that didn't have major wounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>get sent back to the front.</v>

2743
02:48:30.550 --> 02:48:35.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean the exhaustion was such that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>took a month to recover so that they </v>

2744
02:48:35.550 --> 02:48:38.591
<v Speaker 1>could launch another one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>punches and it's called operation blue </v>

2745
02:48:38.591 --> 02:48:42.050
<v Speaker 1>shirt and within a couple of days the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French are discussing,</v>

2746
02:48:42.051 --> 02:48:46.000
<v Speaker 1>abandoning Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving the government to Bordeaux.</v>

2747
02:48:47.290 --> 02:48:52.290
<v Speaker 1>The British are panicked that if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French fold up here and it's a real </v>

2748
02:48:52.960 --> 02:48:57.960
<v Speaker 1>possibility that they will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the British army will be trapped on</v>

2749
02:48:58.120 --> 02:48:59.860
<v Speaker 1>the continent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on French soil.</v>

2750
02:49:00.040 --> 02:49:05.040
<v Speaker 1>They will be hostages in the minds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these people that we're </v>

2751
02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:08.730
<v Speaker 1>discussing coming up with a plan to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the troops out of France,</v>

2752
02:49:09.150 --> 02:49:14.150
<v Speaker 1>hostages to a an arm twisting German </v>
<v Speaker 1>peace agreement right before the </v>

2753
02:49:15.241 --> 02:49:20.241
<v Speaker 1>Americans can come and save Europe with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their massive numbers of people the </v>

2754
02:49:20.761 --> 02:49:25.761
<v Speaker 1>British would have had to knuckle under </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the French were defeated in their </v>

2755
02:49:25.761 --> 02:49:29.391
<v Speaker 1>army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in its hundreds of thousands or low </v>

2756
02:49:29.391 --> 02:49:31.440
<v Speaker 1>millions be held by the Germans for </v>
<v Speaker 1>leverage.</v>

2757
02:49:33.970 --> 02:49:38.970
<v Speaker 1>What we've seen happen here is a replay </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what we saw in both Michael and </v>

2758
02:49:38.970 --> 02:49:42.721
<v Speaker 1>George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet where the Germans again have an </v>

2759
02:49:42.721 --> 02:49:44.401
<v Speaker 1>initial breakthrough that shocking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike operation Michael were the </v>

2760
02:49:45.371 --> 02:49:50.371
<v Speaker 1>Germans broke through and there really </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't any super fantastic goal that </v>

2761
02:49:50.371 --> 02:49:52.090
<v Speaker 1>they could strike at this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they breakthrough,</v>

2762
02:49:52.370 --> 02:49:57.190
<v Speaker 1>it's near Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The French capital Luton.</v>

2763
02:49:57.200 --> 02:50:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Dorf decides to reinforce this attack as</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian passing him labels him,</v>

2764
02:50:00.891 --> 02:50:02.690
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's a pretty good label for</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2765
02:50:03.020 --> 02:50:06.890
<v Speaker 1>He says he's ever the opportunist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never the strategist,</v>

2766
02:50:08.490 --> 02:50:11.160
<v Speaker 1>but that can be taken kind of as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>compliment to Luton.</v>

2767
02:50:11.161 --> 02:50:16.161
<v Speaker 1>Dorf thinks that the ID of pinning </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself down to one standard recipe,</v>

2768
02:50:16.211 --> 02:50:18.440
<v Speaker 1>your set of rules or objectives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2769
02:50:18.450 --> 02:50:21.180
<v Speaker 1>decreases flexibility and he makes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>move toward Paris.</v>

2770
02:50:21.181 --> 02:50:24.300
<v Speaker 1>And we have this crisis again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another soil your underpants moment.</v>

2771
02:50:26.230 --> 02:50:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Ferdinand farash provides as many troops</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he can without totally destroying his</v>

2772
02:50:30.221 --> 02:50:32.830
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to have a counter attack in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the near future.</v>

2773
02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:39.000
<v Speaker 1>The Americans unready untrained get </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown into the mix because of the </v>

2774
02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:40.480
<v Speaker 1>desperation of the times</v>

2775
02:50:42.260 --> 02:50:42.900
<v Speaker 1>they'll fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2776
02:50:42.901 --> 02:50:45.590
<v Speaker 1>a small encounter at Chateau t area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called.</v>

2777
02:50:45.591 --> 02:50:50.591
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll fight a famous battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>in American military history called </v>

2778
02:50:50.591 --> 02:50:52.430
<v Speaker 1>beetle wood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Americans,</v>

2779
02:50:52.431 --> 02:50:54.170
<v Speaker 1>when they get into combat for the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

2780
02:50:54.560 --> 02:50:57.560
<v Speaker 1>they fight like the Europeans fought in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1914.</v>

2781
02:50:58.780 --> 02:51:00.610
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not particularly enamored with,</v>

2782
02:51:00.640 --> 02:51:03.020
<v Speaker 1>with European warfare of what they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen and what they've,</v>

2783
02:51:03.021 --> 02:51:08.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the friendship tried to train them and </v>

2784
02:51:08.021 --> 02:51:08.021
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd rather storm up San Juan Hill and</v>

2785
02:51:08.021 --> 02:51:09.740
<v Speaker 1>simply take these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are we being so,</v>

2786
02:51:10.010 --> 02:51:12.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conniving about it.</v>

2787
02:51:12.081 --> 02:51:13.050
<v Speaker 1>And why are we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2788
02:51:13.051 --> 02:51:18.051
<v Speaker 1>just go up and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a little dash and a little American </v>

2789
02:51:18.051 --> 02:51:20.591
<v Speaker 1>aggressiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll clear out these trenches and </v>

2790
02:51:20.591 --> 02:51:21.170
<v Speaker 1>then these Germans will be on the run </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of this.</v>

2791
02:51:21.440 --> 02:51:26.090
<v Speaker 1>The Americans are taking 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 level casualties.</v>

2792
02:51:26.520 --> 02:51:27.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean they'll suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

2793
02:51:27.741 --> 02:51:30.890
<v Speaker 1>casualties at Bella would boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the war.</v>

2794
02:51:32.120 --> 02:51:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Initial German reports say that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans are almost suicidally,</v>

2795
02:51:35.900 --> 02:51:38.180
<v Speaker 1>brave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good marksman,</v>

2796
02:51:38.181 --> 02:51:41.870
<v Speaker 1>but clumsily lead and the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>artillery,</v>

2797
02:51:42.260 --> 02:51:44.270
<v Speaker 1>which is mostly stuff they borrowed from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French.</v>

2798
02:51:44.271 --> 02:51:46.070
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any of their own heavy </v>
<v Speaker 1>artillery,</v>

2799
02:51:46.310 --> 02:51:49.910
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know how to do basic things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the European armies do all the time now,</v>

2800
02:51:49.911 --> 02:51:54.911
<v Speaker 1>like a creeping barrage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sort of level of cooperation and </v>

2801
02:51:54.911 --> 02:51:57.800
<v Speaker 1>sophistication isn't yet part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>American arsenal,</v>

2802
02:51:58.280 --> 02:52:03.280
<v Speaker 1>but it makes it hard to conduct battles </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the Europeans do at this point.</v>

2803
02:52:03.861 --> 02:52:08.861
<v Speaker 1>Luton door says his fear about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans is that they can go and take </v>

2804
02:52:09.341 --> 02:52:14.341
<v Speaker 1>over a quiet parts of the line from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French and British soldiers that are </v>

2805
02:52:14.341 --> 02:52:16.600
<v Speaker 1>currently there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing those soldiers to be moved into</v>

2806
02:52:16.601 --> 02:52:18.460
<v Speaker 1>positions where they can fight the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans.</v>

2807
02:52:19.630 --> 02:52:24.630
<v Speaker 1>But there are 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans a day arriving in France.</v>

2808
02:52:25.750 --> 02:52:28.750
<v Speaker 1>There are almost 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>by this time.</v>

2809
02:52:28.750 --> 02:52:33.610
<v Speaker 1>In the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there will be 250,000</v>

2810
02:52:33.670 --> 02:52:38.670
<v Speaker 1>every month for the foreseeable future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the emperor and great military </v>

2811
02:52:38.670 --> 02:52:40.420
<v Speaker 1>leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon said about troops,</v>

2812
02:52:40.810 --> 02:52:45.810
<v Speaker 1>quantity has a quality all its own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what Lewd endorphins going to find </v>

2813
02:52:45.810 --> 02:52:48.760
<v Speaker 1>out is that the Americans make damn good</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers,</v>

2814
02:52:50.170 --> 02:52:55.170
<v Speaker 1>the Canadians and the Australians do two</v>
<v Speaker 1>and several historians,</v>

2815
02:52:55.811 --> 02:53:00.811
<v Speaker 1>John Keegan among them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have started saying that by this point </v>

2816
02:53:00.811 --> 02:53:03.961
<v Speaker 1>in the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Canadian and Australian divisions </v>

2817
02:53:03.961 --> 02:53:04.600
<v Speaker 1>are the shock armies of the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>army.</v>

2818
02:53:04.870 --> 02:53:08.950
<v Speaker 1>The British had lost a ton of their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>units in 1916 at the somme.</v>

2819
02:53:08.951 --> 02:53:13.951
<v Speaker 1>And at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Canadians and the Australians are </v>

2820
02:53:13.951 --> 02:53:14.020
<v Speaker 1>healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>

2821
02:53:14.021 --> 02:53:19.021
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still getting sorted the pick of </v>

2822
02:53:19.021 --> 02:53:19.630
<v Speaker 1>the litter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas these British formations involve</v>

2823
02:53:19.631 --> 02:53:22.930
<v Speaker 1>a lot more people that if you had your </v>
<v Speaker 1>druthers,</v>

2824
02:53:23.170 --> 02:53:24.940
<v Speaker 1>should be back in civilian life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2825
02:53:24.941 --> 02:53:28.900
<v Speaker 1>with kids or still finishing up school </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it might be.</v>

2826
02:53:29.850 --> 02:53:34.850
<v Speaker 1>When the Canadians and Australians are </v>
<v Speaker 1>so important at this point in the war </v>

2827
02:53:34.850 --> 02:53:36.340
<v Speaker 1>that the German intelligence pays </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to where they are.</v>

2828
02:53:36.940 --> 02:53:38.020
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2829
02:53:38.410 --> 02:53:43.410
<v Speaker 1>I read somewhere that said that if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>German intelligence saw that the </v>

2830
02:53:43.410 --> 02:53:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Canadians and the Australian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2831
02:53:43.410 --> 02:53:47.761
<v Speaker 1>divisions were right by each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew that some offensive was going </v>

2832
02:53:47.761 --> 02:53:50.801
<v Speaker 1>to happen right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One German soldier quoted after being </v>

2833
02:53:50.801 --> 02:53:52.160
<v Speaker 1>captured by the Canadians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2834
02:53:52.240 --> 02:53:53.830
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been shocked because he said,</v>

2835
02:53:53.831 --> 02:53:55.930
<v Speaker 1>we thought you were up north,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2836
02:53:55.931 --> 02:53:56.320
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2837
02:53:56.321 --> 02:54:01.321
<v Speaker 1>they monitored where they were when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans captured the Americans.</v>

2838
02:54:01.720 --> 02:54:06.720
<v Speaker 1>What had so impressed them was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>combination of how strong and healthy </v>

2839
02:54:07.030 --> 02:54:09.410
<v Speaker 1>the Americans were compared to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2840
02:54:09.580 --> 02:54:14.580
<v Speaker 1>the way that the soldiers that they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>either encountering or living with war </v>

2841
02:54:14.580 --> 02:54:18.310
<v Speaker 1>and also that the equipment was so nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pristine and you know,</v>

2842
02:54:18.311 --> 02:54:23.311
<v Speaker 1>they marveled at the quality of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>leather and the belt buckles and all </v>

2843
02:54:23.311 --> 02:54:23.311
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

2844
02:54:23.311 --> 02:54:27.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] the German army stuff at </v>

2845
02:54:27.570 --> 02:54:27.590
<v Speaker 1>this point is we'll trash their kit as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be called,</v>

2846
02:54:27.591 --> 02:54:29.800
<v Speaker 1>as is trashed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guns and whatnot are still good.</v>

2847
02:54:29.801 --> 02:54:34.801
<v Speaker 1>But in terms of clothing and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German army is looking pretty </v>

2848
02:54:34.801 --> 02:54:38.161
<v Speaker 1>ragged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be two incidents that are </v>

2849
02:54:38.161 --> 02:54:41.011
<v Speaker 1>celebrated in American history that show</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attitude of the Americans is we've </v>

2850
02:54:41.011 --> 02:54:43.870
<v Speaker 1>always celebrated it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One comes during a,</v>

2851
02:54:43.900 --> 02:54:48.900
<v Speaker 1>one of these early battles that involve </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans where they're going into </v>

2852
02:54:48.900 --> 02:54:51.181
<v Speaker 1>action with the French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a moment in time where the </v>

2853
02:54:51.181 --> 02:54:53.311
<v Speaker 1>French decided to call a tactical </v>
<v Speaker 1>retreat because sometimes that's the </v>

2854
02:54:53.311 --> 02:54:53.311
<v Speaker 1>right move to make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2855
02:54:53.311 --> 02:54:53.590
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the playbook.</v>

2856
02:54:53.890 --> 02:54:56.920
<v Speaker 1>And they advise the American captain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Marine captain,</v>

2857
02:54:56.921 --> 02:54:58.510
<v Speaker 1>I believe that he should do the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2858
02:54:58.750 --> 02:55:00.820
<v Speaker 1>And he famously says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>retreat.</v>

2859
02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we only just got here.</v>

2860
02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:08.880
<v Speaker 1>And then there's another famous incident</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has gone down into American </v>

2861
02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:08.880
<v Speaker 1>military law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2862
02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:11.060
<v Speaker 1>from these early battles where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans do too.</v>

2863
02:55:11.060 --> 02:55:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Their impetuosity and suicidal bravery </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the German commander might say,</v>

2864
02:55:17.090 --> 02:55:20.630
<v Speaker 1>get themselves in trouble under fire and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tall grass with a machine gun,</v>

2865
02:55:20.631 --> 02:55:22.310
<v Speaker 1>pinning them down and mowing people </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

2866
02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:25.550
<v Speaker 1>And at a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of their officers and old marine who</v>

2867
02:55:25.551 --> 02:55:30.551
<v Speaker 1>had been at all the classic pre first </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War marine encounters that had </v>

2868
02:55:30.551 --> 02:55:34.361
<v Speaker 1>recently happened from the Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>American war to the Philippines to </v>

2869
02:55:34.361 --> 02:55:37.841
<v Speaker 1>Central America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all that kind of stuff is supposed </v>

2870
02:55:37.841 --> 02:55:37.841
<v Speaker 1>to have stood up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started walking forward,</v>

2871
02:55:37.841 --> 02:55:40.310
<v Speaker 1>firing his weapon from the hip and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yelling at all the soldiers that were on</v>

2872
02:55:40.311 --> 02:55:42.500
<v Speaker 1>their stomachs in the tall grass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on you.</v>

2873
02:55:42.501 --> 02:55:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Sons of bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to live forever?</v>

2874
02:55:45.560 --> 02:55:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ending is a mirror image of the </v>

2875
02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:53.831
<v Speaker 1>other punches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical and human exhaustion combined </v>

2876
02:55:53.831 --> 02:55:57.731
<v Speaker 1>with logistical and supply nightmares </v>
<v Speaker 1>combined with heroic resistance.</v>

2877
02:55:57.771 --> 02:55:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't emphasize enough.</v>

2878
02:55:59.870 --> 02:56:03.620
<v Speaker 1>These battles on both sides are fought </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the ultimate know,</v>

2879
02:56:03.790 --> 02:56:06.410
<v Speaker 1>sort of frenzied striving.</v>

2880
02:56:06.410 --> 02:56:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I can't describe it any other way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Germans are starting to get </v>

2881
02:56:11.410 --> 02:56:12.320
<v Speaker 1>weaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we said,</v>

2882
02:56:12.321 --> 02:56:17.321
<v Speaker 1>they burned their rocket fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're down to people that they had </v>

2883
02:56:17.321 --> 02:56:21.520
<v Speaker 1>planned to be the troops that you put in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trenches that the better troops had </v>

2884
02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:26.111
<v Speaker 1>already conquered to serve in the rear </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just kind of be the last line of </v>

2885
02:56:26.111 --> 02:56:30.041
<v Speaker 1>defense and and a lot of their best </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons were taken and given to the </v>

2886
02:56:30.041 --> 02:56:32.801
<v Speaker 1>other troops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've never been trained in the new </v>

2887
02:56:32.801 --> 02:56:32.801
<v Speaker 1>fire and movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the storm troop tactics.</v>

2888
02:56:32.801 --> 02:56:37.420
<v Speaker 1>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the people now who have to </v>

2889
02:56:37.420 --> 02:56:39.011
<v Speaker 1>make the last few of these punches work </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the better troops at a higher state</v>

2890
02:56:39.081 --> 02:56:42.350
<v Speaker 1>of morale at a better time couldn't make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happen.</v>

2891
02:56:43.190 --> 02:56:46.640
<v Speaker 1>The fourth punches thrown June ninth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called [inaudible] now.</v>

2892
02:56:47.260 --> 02:56:52.260
<v Speaker 1>And this time you don't see that initial</v>
<v Speaker 1>period where the Germans are able to,</v>

2893
02:56:53.080 --> 02:56:58.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make great progress before they're </v>

2894
02:56:58.080 --> 02:56:58.080
<v Speaker 1>stopped here.</v>

2895
02:56:58.080 --> 02:57:00.460
<v Speaker 1>They're just stopped by this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Kaiser sherlocked has cost the </v>

2896
02:57:00.460 --> 02:57:03.740
<v Speaker 1>German army between half a million and </v>
<v Speaker 1>750,000</v>

2897
02:57:03.741 --> 02:57:08.741
<v Speaker 1>casualties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember this punch of theirs that they </v>

2898
02:57:08.991 --> 02:57:12.000
<v Speaker 1>were going to throw was about a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2899
02:57:12.001 --> 02:57:14.000
<v Speaker 1>a million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300,000</v>

2900
02:57:14.090 --> 02:57:19.090
<v Speaker 1>man fist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now it's condition is a little like </v>

2901
02:57:19.090 --> 02:57:23.531
<v Speaker 1>what the condition of your fist would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had been throwing it multiple </v>

2902
02:57:23.531 --> 02:57:26.120
<v Speaker 1>times into a hard object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First it gets nicked,</v>

2903
02:57:26.600 --> 02:57:28.940
<v Speaker 1>then it gets sliced up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts to bleed,</v>

2904
02:57:29.420 --> 02:57:34.420
<v Speaker 1>and then it starts to break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that wasn't enough,</v>

2905
02:57:34.431 --> 02:57:39.431
<v Speaker 1>there are two other things impacting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability of the German army to continue </v>

2906
02:57:39.431 --> 02:57:43.541
<v Speaker 1>to fight like this one is perhaps the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst disease in human history.</v>

2907
02:57:43.911 --> 02:57:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Certainly top five on anyone's list in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of nasty epidemics,</v>

2908
02:57:48.800 --> 02:57:53.800
<v Speaker 1>it's known to history as the Spanish flu</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it probably killed between 50 and </v>

2909
02:57:57.400 --> 02:58:02.400
<v Speaker 1>100 million people at a time when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population was less than 2 billion.</v>

2910
02:58:04.430 --> 02:58:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Some 500 million people will come down </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it and in June and July right at </v>

2911
02:58:10.640 --> 02:58:12.950
<v Speaker 1>the time when all these encounters are </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking place,</v>

2912
02:58:12.951 --> 02:58:17.951
<v Speaker 1>a half million German soldiers have it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in addition to an actual contagion.</v>

2913
02:58:20.210 --> 02:58:23.360
<v Speaker 1>They're dealing in the German army now </v>
<v Speaker 1>with an intellectual one.</v>

2914
02:58:24.830 --> 02:58:29.830
<v Speaker 1>The fire that Dorf had started in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>next door neighbors apartment is now </v>

2915
02:58:31.010 --> 02:58:36.010
<v Speaker 1>coming home to roost and as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is so hard to figure out from the </v>

2916
02:58:36.010 --> 02:58:36.230
<v Speaker 1>memoirs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2917
02:58:36.231 --> 02:58:39.020
<v Speaker 1>how much of these people are actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>bolsheviks,</v>

2918
02:58:39.260 --> 02:58:44.260
<v Speaker 1>how much of them are much more moderate </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialists and how much of it or just </v>

2919
02:58:44.260 --> 02:58:45.500
<v Speaker 1>people that have decided that the war </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be over.</v>

2920
02:58:45.620 --> 02:58:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Guys like Ludendorff and Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put them all in the same category </v>

2921
02:58:50.620 --> 02:58:54.380
<v Speaker 1>and by 1918 is the replacements are </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming to these German units.</v>

2922
02:58:54.381 --> 02:58:59.381
<v Speaker 1>When they need reinforcements from home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are people that have been touched.</v>

2923
02:59:00.830 --> 02:59:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Shall we say by the intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>contagion,</v>

2924
02:59:05.090 --> 02:59:10.090
<v Speaker 1>let loose in Russia by the German high </v>
<v Speaker 1>command to undermine their willingness </v>

2925
02:59:10.161 --> 02:59:15.161
<v Speaker 1>to continue the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they're part of these German </v>

2926
02:59:15.161 --> 02:59:19.280
<v Speaker 1>units.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Author Adam Hochschild writes some stuff</v>

2927
02:59:19.281 --> 02:59:24.281
<v Speaker 1>on the Americans and then shifts gears </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards this intellectual contagion </v>

2928
02:59:24.471 --> 02:59:28.610
<v Speaker 1>issue that Dorf endorphins sort of in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>car makes sort of sense.</v>

2929

<v Speaker 4>in addition to confronting Americans,</v>

2931
02:59:33.961 --> 02:59:37.200
<v Speaker 4>eager for battle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the German high command found danger and</v>

2932
02:59:37.201 --> 02:59:42.201
<v Speaker 4>another quarter the impact of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Russian revolution was beginning to </v>

2933
02:59:42.201 --> 02:59:45.150
<v Speaker 4>ripple through the German army.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As its divisions of eastern front troops</v>

2934
02:59:45.151 --> 02:59:50.151
<v Speaker 4>were transported to France and Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the generals discovered that </v>

2935
02:59:50.151 --> 02:59:54.141
<v Speaker 4>revolutionary ideas had come with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having read German language newspapers </v>

2936

<v Speaker 4>front became rotten with bolshevism.</v>

2940
03:00:07.800 --> 03:00:12.540
<v Speaker 4>A senior German general told an American</v>
<v Speaker 4>newspaper after the war quote,</v>

2941
03:00:12.810 --> 03:00:15.180
<v Speaker 4>we got to the point where we did not </v>
<v Speaker 4>dare transfer.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Hochschild continues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

2944
03:00:20.790 --> 03:00:23.940
<v Speaker 4>soldiers shipped to the western front,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turned rowdy,</v>

2945
03:00:24.120 --> 03:00:28.200
<v Speaker 4>firing shots from train windows and from</v>
<v Speaker 4>one troop train in May,</v>

2946
03:00:28.201 --> 03:00:33.201
<v Speaker 4>19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>18 carrying 631 men 83 deserted along </v>

2947
03:00:33.201 --> 03:00:38.091
<v Speaker 4>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cynical troops chocked capital for </v>

2948
03:00:38.091 --> 03:00:39.360
<v Speaker 4>flanders on the side of the railway </v>
<v Speaker 4>cars,</v>

2949
03:00:39.600 --> 03:00:44.190
<v Speaker 4>taking them west and in half a dozen </v>
<v Speaker 4>German cities underground network sprang</v>

2950
03:00:44.191 --> 03:00:49.191
<v Speaker 4>up to aid deserters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>left sympathizers provided men with </v>

2951
03:00:49.191 --> 03:00:49.470
<v Speaker 4>shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>money,</v>

2952
03:00:49.560 --> 03:00:54.560
<v Speaker 4>forged papers and ration cards and </v>
<v Speaker 4>instructions on the best spots to slip </v>

2953
03:00:54.560 --> 03:00:57.630
<v Speaker 4>across the border into neutral Holland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And quote</v>

2954
03:00:59.510 --> 03:01:00.800
<v Speaker 1>a little over a month</v>

2955
03:01:00.800 --> 03:01:05.420
<v Speaker 5>after the fourth German Punch denies now</v>
<v Speaker 5>is halted quickly.</v>

2956
03:01:06.020 --> 03:01:09.560
<v Speaker 5>Ludin Dorf throws the fifth punch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

2957
03:01:09.561 --> 03:01:14.561
<v Speaker 5>he's planning on a sixth punch up in </v>
<v Speaker 5>flanders again where Georgette just </v>

2958
03:01:15.291 --> 03:01:18.800
<v Speaker 5>failed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But first this fifth punch maybe to draw</v>

2959
03:01:18.830 --> 03:01:22.460
<v Speaker 5>reserves away from Flanders and to who </v>
<v Speaker 5>knows,</v>

2960
03:01:22.461 --> 03:01:24.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>punch a hole and see what happens.</v>

2961
03:01:25.460 --> 03:01:28.370
<v Speaker 5>It's known to history as the second </v>
<v Speaker 5>battle of the Marne.</v>

2962
03:01:29.430 --> 03:01:34.430
<v Speaker 5>And the reason why people remember this </v>
<v Speaker 5>name so well is because instead of the </v>

2963
03:01:34.581 --> 03:01:39.581
<v Speaker 5>Germans breaking through and having this</v>
<v Speaker 5>early success at the second battle of </v>

2964
03:01:39.581 --> 03:01:41.930
<v Speaker 5>the Marne,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they get hammered back.</v>

2965
03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:46.790
<v Speaker 5>They launch a pincer movement at a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at a couple of French cities in one side</v>

2966
03:01:46.791 --> 03:01:48.890
<v Speaker 5>of the pincer is immediately stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The other side,</v>

2967
03:01:49.310 --> 03:01:50.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>goes on for a couple of days,</v>

2968
03:01:50.960 --> 03:01:53.090
<v Speaker 5>slow grinding advance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then it stopped.</v>

2969
03:01:53.420 --> 03:01:58.420
<v Speaker 5>And then the French military leader,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Generalissimo now of the allied on </v>

2970
03:01:59.091 --> 03:02:04.091
<v Speaker 5>ton forces,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ferdinand foshe launches a counter </v>

2971
03:02:04.091 --> 03:02:04.700
<v Speaker 5>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

2972
03:02:04.701 --> 03:02:09.701
<v Speaker 5>historians disagree over whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 5>this counterattack counts as the </v>

2973
03:02:09.701 --> 03:02:12.170
<v Speaker 5>beginning of the big counter attack that</v>
<v Speaker 5>foss has been saving up for.</v>

2974
03:02:12.350 --> 03:02:17.350
<v Speaker 5>Some say it does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Others say that this counter attack is </v>

2975
03:02:17.350 --> 03:02:19.550
<v Speaker 5>more something designed to stop this </v>
<v Speaker 5>battle.</v>

2976
03:02:19.730 --> 03:02:22.160
<v Speaker 5>And the next countertack is the </v>
<v Speaker 5>beginning of the big push.</v>

2977
03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:28.000
<v Speaker 5>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 5>within two days of the second battle of </v>

2978
03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:30.670
<v Speaker 5>the Marne being launched by Luton Dorf,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the allies are counterattacking</v>

2979
03:02:31.880 --> 03:02:35.930
<v Speaker 1>and they're doing it using essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>second world war tactics.</v>

2980
03:02:38.520 --> 03:02:43.520
<v Speaker 1>They hit the Germans in the flank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hit a part of the salient that's a </v>

2981
03:02:43.771 --> 03:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>rear area essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Germans are,</v>

2982
03:02:45.901 --> 03:02:50.901
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to cut down some wheat </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they've just advanced into because </v>

2983
03:02:50.901 --> 03:02:54.681
<v Speaker 1>they're starving and then with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>warning at all and artillery barrage </v>

2984
03:02:56.170 --> 03:03:00.000
<v Speaker 1>just starts and instead of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2985
03:03:00.010 --> 03:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>hitting various positions all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

2986
03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:07.440
<v Speaker 1>the shells instantly come together to </v>
<v Speaker 1>form one of those creeping barrages,</v>

2987
03:03:08.410 --> 03:03:13.410
<v Speaker 1>those walls of explosions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the creeping barrage instantly </v>

2988
03:03:13.410 --> 03:03:17.731
<v Speaker 1>starts moving forward like a giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving hurricane heading toward German </v>

2989
03:03:19.391 --> 03:03:24.391
<v Speaker 1>troops behind this hurricane of shells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This wall of explosions is a giant smoke</v>

2990
03:03:27.631 --> 03:03:32.631
<v Speaker 1>screen and charging out of a forest </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they've been hiding our hundreds </v>

2991
03:03:33.981 --> 03:03:35.090
<v Speaker 1>of light tanks</v>

2992
03:03:36.550 --> 03:03:40.630
<v Speaker 1>followed by infantry and with aircrafts </v>
<v Speaker 1>swooping down,</v>

2993
03:03:40.780 --> 03:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>conducting what we call now ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack missions,</v>

2994
03:03:44.530 --> 03:03:47.830
<v Speaker 1>which is something that did not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist three years previously.</v>

2995
03:03:48.820 --> 03:03:52.080
<v Speaker 1>These tanks didn't either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only are these tanks and you know,</v>

2996
03:03:52.140 --> 03:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of them in one place is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncommon.</v>

2997
03:03:54.670 --> 03:03:58.940
<v Speaker 1>These are a new kind of tanked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a light tank that even Ludin Dorf has to</v>

2998
03:03:58.941 --> 03:04:03.941
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge in his memoirs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made a big difference because they're </v>

2999
03:04:03.941 --> 03:04:04.930
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3000
03:04:05.750 --> 03:04:08.840
<v Speaker 1>they can move at the speed of a jogging </v>
<v Speaker 1>man where the heavy tanks,</v>

3001
03:04:08.841 --> 03:04:13.841
<v Speaker 1>which are the size of a school bus and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have 15 to 20 people in the move at the </v>

3002
03:04:13.841 --> 03:04:18.341
<v Speaker 1>speed of a walking man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of the tanks at once make a </v>

3003
03:04:18.341 --> 03:04:21.881
<v Speaker 1>huge difference as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what their job is is to go take out </v>

3004
03:04:21.881 --> 03:04:24.380
<v Speaker 1>the things that are so damaging to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>infantry,</v>

3005
03:04:24.590 --> 03:04:27.200
<v Speaker 1>thereby making it safe for the infantry </v>
<v Speaker 1>to advance.</v>

3006
03:04:27.200 --> 03:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Remember what the first World War did </v>
<v Speaker 1>was combined a bunch of new weapons </v>

3007
03:04:32.200 --> 03:04:36.131
<v Speaker 1>systems together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The changed everything to have the most </v>

3008
03:04:36.131 --> 03:04:37.370
<v Speaker 1>important of them were machine guns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>barbed wire.</v>

3009
03:04:38.150 --> 03:04:41.960
<v Speaker 1>The first thing these tanks do is crush </v>
<v Speaker 1>the barbed wire and go after the machine</v>

3010
03:04:41.961 --> 03:04:46.961
<v Speaker 1>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Machine guns can't hurt the tanks and </v>

3011
03:04:46.961 --> 03:04:46.961
<v Speaker 1>what they basically do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they often don't even use their guns.</v>

3012
03:04:46.961 --> 03:04:49.730
<v Speaker 1>They often just drive right over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine gun nest,</v>

3013
03:04:49.731 --> 03:04:52.580
<v Speaker 1>any of their crushed the people inside </v>
<v Speaker 1>or force them to flee,</v>

3014
03:04:52.940 --> 03:04:57.940
<v Speaker 1>but this opens up the battlefield for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the infantry who are following close </v>

3015
03:04:57.940 --> 03:05:01.661
<v Speaker 1>behind Luton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dorf also mentions in his memoirs that </v>

3016
03:05:01.661 --> 03:05:06.551
<v Speaker 1>the French are using.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He calls them tanks that hold infantry </v>

3017
03:05:06.680 --> 03:05:09.800
<v Speaker 1>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this infantry drives up in the tank onto</v>

3018
03:05:09.801 --> 03:05:12.740
<v Speaker 1>the battlefield.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dismounts sets up a machine gun nest and</v>

3019
03:05:12.741 --> 03:05:14.960
<v Speaker 1>the and the tank goes back to pick up </v>
<v Speaker 1>more infantry.</v>

3020
03:05:15.020 --> 03:05:17.870
<v Speaker 1>He's basically describing armored </v>
<v Speaker 1>personnel carriers.</v>

3021
03:05:18.740 --> 03:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>These generals throughout this war have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been accused of being unimaginative.</v>

3022
03:05:24.291 --> 03:05:29.291
<v Speaker 1>Butchers are figuring out how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome the challenges of early 20th </v>

3023
03:05:30.321 --> 03:05:34.190
<v Speaker 1>century warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Germans on their side have some very</v>

3024
03:05:34.191 --> 03:05:35.990
<v Speaker 1>forward thinking generals who are good </v>
<v Speaker 1>at this.</v>

3025
03:05:36.170 --> 03:05:38.480
<v Speaker 1>The allies do to one of them's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian guy,</v>

3026
03:05:38.481 --> 03:05:40.570
<v Speaker 1>another is an Australian general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3027
03:05:40.680 --> 03:05:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Korean monash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're coming up with new tactics.</v>

3028
03:05:44.360 --> 03:05:49.360
<v Speaker 1>The French have generals who were coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with new tactics and together they </v>

3029
03:05:49.360 --> 03:05:52.640
<v Speaker 1>are overcoming the traditional things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that slow down and offense,</v>

3030
03:05:53.930 --> 03:05:56.630
<v Speaker 1>you might call it a form of Provo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Blitzkrieg,</v>

3031
03:05:58.310 --> 03:06:00.670
<v Speaker 1>American soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elton Emac,</v>

3032
03:06:00.671 --> 03:06:05.671
<v Speaker 1>and was at this counter attack and had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been told that there wouldn't be a </v>

3033
03:06:05.671 --> 03:06:07.730
<v Speaker 1>preliminary barrage that this wall of </v>
<v Speaker 1>steel,</v>

3034
03:06:07.731 --> 03:06:12.731
<v Speaker 1>this moving wall of steel would just </v>
<v Speaker 1>appear instantly and in the infantry </v>

3035
03:06:12.731 --> 03:06:15.230
<v Speaker 1>would rushing afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he describes the situation like this</v>

3036
03:06:15.710 --> 03:06:16.160
<v Speaker 1>quote.</v>

3037
03:06:16.700 --> 03:06:21.700
<v Speaker 1>One instant there was silence and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world went mad in a smashing burst </v>

3038
03:06:21.700 --> 03:06:23.660
<v Speaker 1>of sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men caught off.</v>

3039
03:06:23.661 --> 03:06:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Balance were hurled to the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which shook against the guns minds.</v>

3040
03:06:28.220 --> 03:06:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Stupefied refused all function for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment and rebuild everything within 100</v>

3041
03:06:33.561 --> 03:06:38.561
<v Speaker 1>yards was nod in bitter tearing bites at</v>
<v Speaker 1>men and trees and wire.</v>

3042
03:06:39.170 --> 03:06:43.880
<v Speaker 1>The stately forest melted beneath a </v>
<v Speaker 1>raging storm of fire and steel,</v>

3043
03:06:44.150 --> 03:06:49.150
<v Speaker 1>heavy branches and tree trunks crush the</v>
<v Speaker 1>life out for men who coward among the </v>

3044
03:06:49.150 --> 03:06:51.650
<v Speaker 1>roots for shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One heard a furious,</v>

3045
03:06:51.680 --> 03:06:55.160
<v Speaker 1>awful screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the shell fire rolled away,</v>

3046
03:06:55.350 --> 03:07:00.350
<v Speaker 1>then mad waves of charging infantry came</v>
<v Speaker 1>after it mopping up and quote this </v>

3047
03:07:02.981 --> 03:07:07.981
<v Speaker 1>allied counter offensive puts an end to </v>
<v Speaker 1>all those punches that the German army </v>

3048
03:07:08.351 --> 03:07:13.110
<v Speaker 1>had been throwing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ludendorff will very quickly cancel that</v>

3049
03:07:13.111 --> 03:07:18.111
<v Speaker 1>punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was thinking about throwing up in </v>

3050
03:07:18.111 --> 03:07:20.091
<v Speaker 1>flanders again and he'll put the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>army on the defensive and the German </v>

3051
03:07:20.091 --> 03:07:23.280
<v Speaker 1>army has now reached a point in this war</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

3052
03:07:23.430 --> 03:07:25.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it in a lot of wars actually,</v>

3053
03:07:25.261 --> 03:07:30.261
<v Speaker 1>but it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that point when you're not </v>

3054
03:07:30.261 --> 03:07:30.780
<v Speaker 1>defeated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can no longer when,</v>

3055
03:07:32.410 --> 03:07:36.580
<v Speaker 1>how you play that card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when your Delta is very interesting</v>

3056
03:07:39.220 --> 03:07:43.240
<v Speaker 1>and once again makes us wonder about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3057
03:07:43.241 --> 03:07:48.241
<v Speaker 1>how sound the mind of the man who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to play this card is during this </v>

3058
03:07:50.681 --> 03:07:55.681
<v Speaker 1>time period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luton Dorf has been spotted by </v>

3059
03:07:55.681 --> 03:07:55.681
<v Speaker 1>subordinates crying.</v>

3060
03:07:56.810 --> 03:08:01.810
<v Speaker 1>At one point they will carefully </v>
<v Speaker 1>convinced him to go see a psychiatrist </v>

3061
03:08:03.270 --> 03:08:05.750
<v Speaker 1>and the exchange is actually almost a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little comical.</v>

3062
03:08:05.751 --> 03:08:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3063
03:08:06.261 --> 03:08:08.750
<v Speaker 1>these are human beings and we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some sympathy,</v>

3064
03:08:08.751 --> 03:08:11.900
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychiatrist is saying things like,</v>

3065
03:08:11.901 --> 03:08:13.820
<v Speaker 1>you never get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never smelled the air.</v>

3066
03:08:13.821 --> 03:08:15.230
<v Speaker 1>What was the last time you had some good</v>
<v Speaker 1>food?</v>

3067
03:08:15.231 --> 03:08:15.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3068
03:08:15.660 --> 03:08:16.730
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just sort of a,</v>

3069
03:08:16.731 --> 03:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>you never think about yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ludendorff is going,</v>

3070
03:08:18.801 --> 03:08:19.340
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

3071
03:08:19.341 --> 03:08:20.030
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

3072
03:08:20.210 --> 03:08:22.220
<v Speaker 1>It's all true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what can I do?</v>

3073
03:08:22.330 --> 03:08:26.210
<v Speaker 1>And then later says that the war has </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken everything.</v>

3074
03:08:27.560 --> 03:08:30.890
<v Speaker 1>In one sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not exaggerating.</v>

3075
03:08:31.610 --> 03:08:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Soon after the German Michael Offensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>Starts,</v>

3076
03:08:35.601 --> 03:08:40.601
<v Speaker 1>Luton Dorf motors into territory that </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been recently conquered by the </v>

3077
03:08:40.601 --> 03:08:45.011
<v Speaker 1>Germans and some of this ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>contained graves and Luton door pulls up</v>

3078
03:08:45.681 --> 03:08:47.140
<v Speaker 1>in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story goes,</v>

3079
03:08:47.540 --> 03:08:50.450
<v Speaker 1>has them dig up the remains in one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the graves,</v>

3080
03:08:50.780 --> 03:08:53.360
<v Speaker 1>and he identifies his son,</v>

3081
03:08:54.810 --> 03:08:59.810
<v Speaker 1>also named Eric Luton Dorf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a stepson actually,</v>

3082
03:09:00.300 --> 03:09:05.300
<v Speaker 1>but supposedly he was as close to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>as biological sons and this was the </v>

3083
03:09:05.300 --> 03:09:09.021
<v Speaker 1>second son that he'd lost in this war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also the second pilot,</v>

3084
03:09:11.040 --> 03:09:16.040
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting to sort of compare and </v>

3085
03:09:16.040 --> 03:09:16.710
<v Speaker 1>contrast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the last war where you see a lot</v>

3086
03:09:17.070 --> 03:09:18.450
<v Speaker 1>of famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>

3087
03:09:18.451 --> 03:09:21.330
<v Speaker 1>important people lose their children in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the war.</v>

3088
03:09:22.380 --> 03:09:27.380
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of another time period </v>
<v Speaker 1>after this where it's been anything </v>

3089
03:09:27.380 --> 03:09:27.380
<v Speaker 1>quite like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3090
03:09:27.380 --> 03:09:28.920
<v Speaker 1>not only just alluded to or Flus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two step sons,</v>

3091
03:09:28.950 --> 03:09:32.640
<v Speaker 1>but just off the top of my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prime minister who Britain,</v>

3092
03:09:32.950 --> 03:09:37.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went through the first two or so years </v>

3093
03:09:37.950 --> 03:09:37.950
<v Speaker 1>of the war with Herbert Asquith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lost a son,</v>

3094
03:09:37.950 --> 03:09:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Ferdinand Foshe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the generalist demo of the allies.</v>

3095
03:09:39.691 --> 03:09:44.691
<v Speaker 1>He lost a son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And famously when he had been told the </v>

3096
03:09:44.691 --> 03:09:47.721
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was busy in the middle of an </v>

3097
03:09:47.721 --> 03:09:47.721
<v Speaker 1>offensive and doing stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was told the news,</v>

3098
03:09:47.721 --> 03:09:51.111
<v Speaker 1>he gave himself a half hour to grieve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>composed himself and got back to work.</v>

3099
03:09:51.690 --> 03:09:54.000
<v Speaker 1>Theodore Roosevelt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the famous junkie,</v>

3100
03:09:54.320 --> 03:09:56.920
<v Speaker 1>encouraged his kids to get involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then last one,</v>

3101
03:09:58.270 --> 03:09:59.260
<v Speaker 1>a pilot also.</v>

3102
03:10:01.270 --> 03:10:06.020
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to know how much losing his </v>
<v Speaker 1>second son in this war affected Luton.</v>

3103
03:10:06.030 --> 03:10:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Dorf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm tempted to feel it gets just one </v>

3104
03:10:11.030 --> 03:10:12.040
<v Speaker 1>more straw weighing down the camel's </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

3105
03:10:12.790 --> 03:10:14.450
<v Speaker 1>And he's in one of these positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3106
03:10:14.451 --> 03:10:19.451
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always fascinated by the extreme </v>

3107
03:10:19.451 --> 03:10:21.340
<v Speaker 1>human situations and Luton Doris in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those positions now in history.</v>

3108
03:10:21.341 --> 03:10:26.341
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of people who've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>in them whether under this extreme </v>

3109
03:10:26.341 --> 03:10:29.041
<v Speaker 1>crushing stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always wonder how much they can </v>

3110
03:10:29.041 --> 03:10:31.321
<v Speaker 1>take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is there a limit that everyone has </v>

3111
03:10:31.321 --> 03:10:33.961
<v Speaker 1>or could you plug some other person with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some other personality type in the </v>

3112
03:10:33.961 --> 03:10:37.801
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ludendorff scene and have them do </v>

3113
03:10:37.801 --> 03:10:37.801
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>May Look at adults.</v>

3114
03:10:37.801 --> 03:10:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Hitler in the last four months of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Second World War.</v>

3115
03:10:39.761 --> 03:10:44.761
<v Speaker 1>He's under this crushing sword of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Damocles pressure and he's this palsy </v>

3116
03:10:45.340 --> 03:10:50.340
<v Speaker 1>rec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you put someone else in that role </v>

3117
03:10:50.340 --> 03:10:50.340
<v Speaker 1>and had them do much better?</v>

3118
03:10:50.340 --> 03:10:52.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where the limits of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>endurance are,</v>

3119
03:10:53.860 --> 03:10:57.610
<v Speaker 1>but you know it's a question that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>valid across the board.</v>

3120
03:10:57.611 --> 03:11:00.520
<v Speaker 1>You don't just want to ask it about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people at the top of the food chain,</v>

3121
03:11:00.521 --> 03:11:05.521
<v Speaker 1>like the lewd endorse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also want to ask it about the </v>

3122
03:11:05.521 --> 03:11:07.810
<v Speaker 1>soldiers collectively in the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long can they endure,</v>

3123
03:11:08.440 --> 03:11:10.570
<v Speaker 1>and also about the people back home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

3124
03:11:10.990 --> 03:11:15.550
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that this war really </v>
<v Speaker 1>inaugurated as the idea of total war,</v>

3125
03:11:16.030 --> 03:11:18.610
<v Speaker 1>although you can go back to other times </v>
<v Speaker 1>in history and you see it,</v>

3126
03:11:18.611 --> 03:11:23.611
<v Speaker 1>but in the modern era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>total war means the involvement of the </v>

3127
03:11:23.611 --> 03:11:27.270
<v Speaker 1>what's called the home front and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are needed in this endeavor </v>

3128
03:11:27.270 --> 03:11:27.520
<v Speaker 1>because they produce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if nothing else,</v>

3129
03:11:27.790 --> 03:11:29.410
<v Speaker 1>you know all the munitions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

3130
03:11:29.411 --> 03:11:31.510
<v Speaker 1>The troops at the front need to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

3131
03:11:31.810 --> 03:11:34.750
<v Speaker 1>What happens when they reach the limits </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their endurance.</v>

3132
03:11:37.330 --> 03:11:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this last part of the war in the last </v>

3133
03:11:42.330 --> 03:11:46.260
<v Speaker 1>couple of months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll be known as the hundred days is </v>

3134
03:11:46.260 --> 03:11:46.260
<v Speaker 1>one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3135
03:11:46.260 --> 03:11:50.450
<v Speaker 1>it's not a heavily studied part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war because it's not like the trench </v>

3136
03:11:50.450 --> 03:11:55.141
<v Speaker 1>warfare part of the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's one of those occurrences that </v>

3137
03:11:55.141 --> 03:11:59.280
<v Speaker 1>that when you read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it brings strange emotions to the fore </v>

3138
03:12:00.250 --> 03:12:05.250
<v Speaker 1>because what you're watching is a sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a doomed effort and the costs of the </v>

3139
03:12:07.511 --> 03:12:12.511
<v Speaker 1>doomed effort are beyond belief and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you watch it,</v>

3140
03:12:12.521 --> 03:12:17.521
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what to think because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something unbelievably admirable</v>

3141
03:12:18.940 --> 03:12:23.940
<v Speaker 1>about the people in this story's </v>
<v Speaker 1>willingness to sacrifice all for </v>

3142
03:12:24.820 --> 03:12:29.820
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of you just screams out at what</v>

3143
03:12:31.491 --> 03:12:34.230
<v Speaker 1>appears to a person not in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

3144
03:12:34.231 --> 03:12:36.540
<v Speaker 1>And let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raised on much more cynical,</v>

3145
03:12:36.541 --> 03:12:39.180
<v Speaker 1>modern values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What appears to be,</v>

3146
03:12:39.540 --> 03:12:43.160
<v Speaker 1>frankly not that smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3147
03:12:43.161 --> 03:12:47.960
<v Speaker 1>If you think that the war is over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are looking at it from the early 20,</v>

3148
03:12:47.961 --> 03:12:52.961
<v Speaker 1>first century as we are and you watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>these go through unbelievable things to </v>

3149
03:12:53.421 --> 03:12:54.950
<v Speaker 1>prolong it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3150
03:12:54.951 --> 03:12:59.951
<v Speaker 1>one second longer or something you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>help but feel like you want to scream </v>

3151
03:12:59.951 --> 03:13:01.910
<v Speaker 1>out against the collective waste of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

3152
03:13:02.600 --> 03:13:04.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know that this is done,</v>

3153
03:13:04.521 --> 03:13:08.330
<v Speaker 1>why let this continue and it's a strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

3154
03:13:08.331 --> 03:13:13.331
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something heroic about the last </v>

3155
03:13:13.331 --> 03:13:14.660
<v Speaker 1>several months of the war</v>

3156
03:13:15.730 --> 03:13:18.090
<v Speaker 1>and one side of the heroism and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3157
03:13:18.150 --> 03:13:20.320
<v Speaker 1>and again for people in the 21st </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

3158
03:13:20.321 --> 03:13:20.890
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3159
03:13:20.910 --> 03:13:25.910
<v Speaker 1>it's a little strange because we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second world war intervening in the </v>

3160
03:13:25.910 --> 03:13:28.981
<v Speaker 1>way we think about things in the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>world war really had a good and evil </v>

3161
03:13:28.981 --> 03:13:32.041
<v Speaker 1>feel to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first world war was sold as a good </v>

3162
03:13:32.041 --> 03:13:33.370
<v Speaker 1>and evil war and the people at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>period kind of treated it that way,</v>

3163
03:13:33.580 --> 03:13:36.940
<v Speaker 1>but a hundred years later as we are now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look back on it and see.</v>

3164
03:13:37.210 --> 03:13:41.290
<v Speaker 1>It's really not a good evil war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really more of a old line,</v>

3165
03:13:41.291 --> 03:13:42.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>power of politics,</v>

3166
03:13:42.661 --> 03:13:43.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>international relations.</v>

3167
03:13:43.781 --> 03:13:44.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3168
03:13:44.230 --> 03:13:48.280
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty representative in the much </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger scale,</v>

3169
03:13:48.310 --> 03:13:50.140
<v Speaker 1>the kind of wars people have always </v>
<v Speaker 1>fought.</v>

3170
03:13:53.350 --> 03:13:58.350
<v Speaker 1>And once you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can begin to see everyone's </v>

3171
03:13:58.350 --> 03:13:58.720
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice in a certain light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I said,</v>

3172
03:13:59.680 --> 03:14:04.680
<v Speaker 1>in a strange way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the light that these people sacrifice </v>

3173
03:14:04.680 --> 03:14:07.860
<v Speaker 1>really takes on in the last several </v>
<v Speaker 1>months of the war is his heroism and the</v>

3174
03:14:08.501 --> 03:14:13.501
<v Speaker 1>very old grand sense of the term and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a sort of a doomed heroism.</v>

3175
03:14:15.750 --> 03:14:17.430
<v Speaker 1>And as we said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3176
03:14:17.431 --> 03:14:21.330
<v Speaker 1>there's a very toll can ask feeling to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first world war.</v>

3177
03:14:21.331 --> 03:14:24.030
<v Speaker 1>And many people will say that that's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>an accident token.</v>

3178
03:14:24.031 --> 03:14:25.950
<v Speaker 1>As we've mentioned in an earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode,</v>

3179
03:14:26.460 --> 03:14:31.460
<v Speaker 1>was in this war as a soldier started </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing the stuff that would become </v>

3180
03:14:31.460 --> 03:14:33.010
<v Speaker 1>things like the Lord of the rings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3181
03:14:33.030 --> 03:14:38.030
<v Speaker 1>in this conflict based certain scenes of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lord of the rings on things he'd </v>

3182
03:14:38.030 --> 03:14:41.811
<v Speaker 1>seen in this war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way that token sort of underpins</v>

3183
03:14:42.961 --> 03:14:47.961
<v Speaker 1>his whole Lord of the rings story is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>last alliance of the grand old peoples </v>

3184
03:14:49.161 --> 03:14:54.161
<v Speaker 1>that used to be so powerful to take down</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark power and then you know,</v>

3185
03:14:55.741 --> 03:14:59.190
<v Speaker 1>one of two things can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either they could lose to the dark power</v>

3186
03:14:59.191 --> 03:15:04.191
<v Speaker 1>and everything will be covered in </v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness or they can beat the dark </v>

3187
03:15:04.191 --> 03:15:07.431
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in so doing will so damage </v>

3188
03:15:07.431 --> 03:15:08.060
<v Speaker 1>themselves that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3189
03:15:08.070 --> 03:15:10.980
<v Speaker 1>high water mark on the world stage will </v>
<v Speaker 1>also be over.</v>

3190
03:15:10.980 --> 03:15:15.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a doomed victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of what we're watching </v>

3191
03:15:15.980 --> 03:15:20.331
<v Speaker 1>in these last couple of months of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war were a frightfully high amount of </v>

3192
03:15:21.241 --> 03:15:26.241
<v Speaker 1>damage is being done to all sides in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this effort to bring what's now a </v>

3193
03:15:26.241 --> 03:15:30.681
<v Speaker 1>foregone conclusion to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people are dying over terms.</v>

3194
03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we kill enough of the enemy to make </v>

3195
03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:38.880
<v Speaker 1>them give us a little more leeway on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this point in a peace treaty?</v>

3196
03:15:39.630 --> 03:15:41.280
<v Speaker 1>That's what these people are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>dying for.</v>

3197
03:15:41.700 --> 03:15:46.700
<v Speaker 1>But they're dying in such large numbers </v>
<v Speaker 1>that these will be mortal wounds really </v>

3198
03:15:47.341 --> 03:15:52.341
<v Speaker 1>to the British and the French empires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if mortal wounds in terms of </v>

3199
03:15:52.341 --> 03:15:53.100
<v Speaker 1>replaceability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because eventually you can replace those</v>

3200
03:15:53.101 --> 03:15:58.101
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may be mortal wounds on an imperial </v>

3201
03:15:58.101 --> 03:16:01.581
<v Speaker 1>psyche whose cost was now appearing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be unsustainable.</v>

3202
03:16:04.350 --> 03:16:09.350
<v Speaker 1>On August eighth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the allied powers launched the long </v>

3203
03:16:09.350 --> 03:16:13.311
<v Speaker 1>awaited counterattack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the punch back against the exhausted </v>

3204
03:16:13.311 --> 03:16:18.261
<v Speaker 1>German forces in the hopes that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>snap back like a rubber band.</v>

3205
03:16:18.751 --> 03:16:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Everything that they had taken in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past couple of months,</v>

3206
03:16:22.020 --> 03:16:24.480
<v Speaker 1>they have washed up to the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beach as we said,</v>

3207
03:16:24.481 --> 03:16:28.410
<v Speaker 1>the tide that had run out of momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on August eighth,</v>

3208
03:16:28.950 --> 03:16:33.950
<v Speaker 1>they were hit with such extreme violence</v>
<v Speaker 1>in in several places that Ludin door,</v>

3209
03:16:36.030 --> 03:16:40.680
<v Speaker 1>we'll call it the black day of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>German army in the history of this war,</v>

3210
03:16:41.880 --> 03:16:46.880
<v Speaker 1>and he'll call it that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not so much because the Germans were </v>

3211
03:16:46.880 --> 03:16:49.020
<v Speaker 1>smashed and pushed backward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were,</v>

3212
03:16:49.770 --> 03:16:54.770
<v Speaker 1>but because it seemed to be the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>real confirmation that the morale limits</v>

3213
03:16:56.491 --> 03:16:59.400
<v Speaker 1>had been reached.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least for some of these soldiers.</v>

3214
03:17:00.910 --> 03:17:03.250
<v Speaker 1>There were a ton of surrenders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

3215
03:17:03.251 --> 03:17:08.251
<v Speaker 1>which is what had happened a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks before when the French had </v>

3216
03:17:08.251 --> 03:17:08.620
<v Speaker 1>launched that battle with all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>light tanks.</v>

3217
03:17:08.621 --> 03:17:13.621
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Germans surrendered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they did again here and they didn't </v>

3218
03:17:13.621 --> 03:17:16.111
<v Speaker 1>surrender in ones or twos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know guys that had been cornered in </v>

3219
03:17:16.111 --> 03:17:20.551
<v Speaker 1>shell holes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They came in groups heavily armed men </v>

3220
03:17:20.551 --> 03:17:25.030
<v Speaker 1>led by junior officers who would </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrender to the first allied officer.</v>

3221
03:17:25.031 --> 03:17:25.900
<v Speaker 1>They ran into</v>

3222
03:17:27.370 --> 03:17:28.300
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50,</v>

3223
03:17:28.301 --> 03:17:30.470
<v Speaker 1>75 men at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was it.</v>

3224
03:17:30.600 --> 03:17:33.190
<v Speaker 1>It was a sign of something different </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Germans didn't do this.</v>

3225
03:17:33.220 --> 03:17:36.730
<v Speaker 1>It was a sign that we were reaching the </v>
<v Speaker 1>limits of endurance.</v>

3226
03:17:36.731 --> 03:17:41.731
<v Speaker 1>At least for some of these units.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The army had become brittle and on </v>

3227
03:17:41.731 --> 03:17:44.050
<v Speaker 1>August eighth you see that because some </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of the army held firm,</v>

3228
03:17:44.350 --> 03:17:46.390
<v Speaker 1>but when you're trying to keep a solid </v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

3229
03:17:46.660 --> 03:17:51.660
<v Speaker 1>if it gives away anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the enemy streams through that and then </v>

3230
03:17:51.660 --> 03:17:53.680
<v Speaker 1>surrounds all the other position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turning them into little islands amongst</v>

3231
03:17:53.681 --> 03:17:58.681
<v Speaker 1>the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of my favorite stories from </v>

3232
03:17:58.681 --> 03:18:01.681
<v Speaker 1>August eighth because it really brings </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward this sense of confusion is I'm </v>

3233
03:18:02.310 --> 03:18:07.310
<v Speaker 1>an officer in the second line of Defense</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's in a bunker on a telephone trying </v>

3234
03:18:07.310 --> 03:18:09.730
<v Speaker 1>to get news of what the heck's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could hear stuff.</v>

3235
03:18:10.750 --> 03:18:13.690
<v Speaker 1>It's foggy that day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of like Mother Nature,</v>

3236
03:18:13.980 --> 03:18:16.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to equal the odds because it had</v>

3237
03:18:16.301 --> 03:18:18.820
<v Speaker 1>been foggy through so many of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>punches.</v>

3238
03:18:18.820 --> 03:18:20.590
<v Speaker 1>The Germans had recently thrown in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

3239
03:18:20.620 --> 03:18:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

3240
03:18:21.401 --> 03:18:23.110
<v Speaker 1>spring offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems only fair.</v>

3241
03:18:23.320 --> 03:18:25.000
<v Speaker 1>It would be foggy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3242
03:18:25.001 --> 03:18:26.350
<v Speaker 1>the day the allies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>countertack,</v>

3243
03:18:26.410 --> 03:18:29.890
<v Speaker 1>and it is in that bunker commander says </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even see 10 feet out there.</v>

3244
03:18:30.700 --> 03:18:35.700
<v Speaker 1>And then as he's on the phone trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what's going on in aid comes </v>

3245
03:18:35.700 --> 03:18:36.700
<v Speaker 1>down the stairs and says that the lines </v>
<v Speaker 1>are broken and the enemy is,</v>

3246
03:18:36.850 --> 03:18:37.360
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>

3247
03:18:37.420 --> 03:18:40.810
<v Speaker 1>has bypassed this readout and is behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3248
03:18:41.020 --> 03:18:46.020
<v Speaker 1>And he says that before the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking even gets the whole message </v>

3249
03:18:46.020 --> 03:18:48.961
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grenades are rolling down his into </v>

3250
03:18:48.961 --> 03:18:50.050
<v Speaker 1>his bunker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

3251
03:18:50.051 --> 03:18:52.240
<v Speaker 1>the enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are already throwing grenades.</v>

3252
03:18:52.680 --> 03:18:56.140
<v Speaker 1>So to sum up how August eighth looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the allies,</v>

3253
03:18:56.141 --> 03:18:57.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the north up,</v>

3254
03:18:57.390 --> 03:18:57.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3255
03:18:58.210 --> 03:19:00.910
<v Speaker 1>the British who are using the Canadians </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Australians as we said,</v>

3256
03:19:00.911 --> 03:19:05.911
<v Speaker 1>as sort of shock armies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use 500 plus tanks.</v>

3257
03:19:06.070 --> 03:19:07.690
<v Speaker 1>And most of them are the big heavy ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3258
03:19:07.840 --> 03:19:12.840
<v Speaker 1>that are like school buses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they have the aircraft come in and </v>

3259
03:19:12.840 --> 03:19:14.260
<v Speaker 1>do the ground attack missions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the infantry come out,</v>

3260
03:19:14.261 --> 03:19:15.490
<v Speaker 1>they use the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3261
03:19:15.491 --> 03:19:20.491
<v Speaker 1>the wall of shelves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no preliminary bombardment and </v>

3262
03:19:20.491 --> 03:19:21.850
<v Speaker 1>German units just break in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3263
03:19:23.170 --> 03:19:25.140
<v Speaker 1>The French have success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3264
03:19:25.150 --> 03:19:30.150
<v Speaker 1>in theirs that they launch a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours later and the allies are pushing </v>

3265
03:19:30.150 --> 03:19:34.891
<v Speaker 1>through German lines and making what by </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war standards is great </v>

3266
03:19:35.711 --> 03:19:40.711
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's how historian Nick Lloyd </v>

3267
03:19:40.711 --> 03:19:40.711
<v Speaker 1>describes the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

3268
03:19:40.711 --> 03:19:43.270
<v Speaker 1>eighth August would be one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable days of the war.</v>

3269
03:19:43.510 --> 03:19:46.090
<v Speaker 1>Although the position of all units was </v>
<v Speaker 1>not known.</v>

3270
03:19:46.270 --> 03:19:51.270
<v Speaker 1>The ally to salted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>driven between six and eight miles into </v>

3271
03:19:51.270 --> 03:19:52.870
<v Speaker 1>German lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shattering the second army and unhinging</v>

3272
03:19:52.871 --> 03:19:57.640
<v Speaker 1>the flank of the 18th army on its left </v>
<v Speaker 1>German casualties had been staggering.</v>

3273
03:19:57.910 --> 03:20:01.480
<v Speaker 1>The official history estimated that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were as high as 48,000</v>

3274
03:20:01.481 --> 03:20:03.700
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including 33,000</v>

3275
03:20:03.701 --> 03:20:08.701
<v Speaker 1>missing or taken prisoner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>400 guns had been lost as well as </v>

3276
03:20:08.701 --> 03:20:12.931
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of machine guns and trench </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortars for the battalions in the front </v>

3277
03:20:12.931 --> 03:20:16.711
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often only small groups of survivors </v>

3278
03:20:16.711 --> 03:20:16.711
<v Speaker 1>remained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He then continues,</v>

3279
03:20:16.711 --> 03:20:21.391
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>numerous frontline battalions had been </v>

3280
03:20:21.391 --> 03:20:24.151
<v Speaker 1>reduced to the size of companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that remained were clusters of </v>

3281
03:20:24.151 --> 03:20:27.961
<v Speaker 1>shellshocked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men there will utterly broken their </v>

3282
03:20:27.961 --> 03:20:28.240
<v Speaker 1>faces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grimy their eyes,</v>

3283
03:20:28.270 --> 03:20:30.100
<v Speaker 1>glassy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>staring straight ahead.</v>

3284
03:20:30.310 --> 03:20:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Their stories were always the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Horrifying accounts of iron monsters </v>

3285
03:20:35.310 --> 03:20:39.901
<v Speaker 1>clinking out of the mists towards them </v>
<v Speaker 1>of mass infantry attacks of being cut </v>

3286
03:20:39.901 --> 03:20:43.270
<v Speaker 1>off and surrounded of waiting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter attacks that never came.</v>

3287
03:20:43.540 --> 03:20:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Some did not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps could not say anything at </v>

3288
03:20:48.540 --> 03:20:48.600
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ludina doors,</v>

3289
03:20:48.601 --> 03:20:53.601
<v Speaker 1>worst nightmare was it seemed coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>true and quote in his memoirs is very </v>

3290
03:20:57.011 --> 03:20:59.290
<v Speaker 1>suspect and take it with a grain of salt</v>
<v Speaker 1>memoirs,</v>

3291
03:20:59.830 --> 03:21:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Ludin Dorf claims to have sent an </v>
<v Speaker 1>observer to go and check out the scene </v>

3292
03:21:05.170 --> 03:21:08.500
<v Speaker 1>where these units were breaking and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

3293
03:21:08.501 --> 03:21:13.501
<v Speaker 1>the observer came back and said that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>troops at the front line were yelling at</v>

3294
03:21:14.050 --> 03:21:16.690
<v Speaker 1>the reserves as they came up to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>their place.</v>

3295
03:21:17.290 --> 03:21:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Black legs strike breakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're prolonging the war,</v>

3296
03:21:23.170 --> 03:21:26.830
<v Speaker 1>and Luton Dorf pointed out that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was no way to hide.</v>

3297
03:21:26.831 --> 03:21:31.831
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the changes in the fighting </v>

3298
03:21:31.831 --> 03:21:31.870
<v Speaker 1>efficiency as he called it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the troops,</v>

3299
03:21:32.110 --> 03:21:34.510
<v Speaker 1>they become brittle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't depend on some of them.</v>

3300
03:21:35.580 --> 03:21:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Ludina says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

3301
03:21:36.791 --> 03:21:38.110
<v Speaker 1>that I warned you about this all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3302
03:21:38.111 --> 03:21:42.040
<v Speaker 1>It's the bolshevism taking hold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to shoot more of them maybe as</v>

3303
03:21:42.041 --> 03:21:46.940
<v Speaker 1>a way to stiffen the defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then he says that this convinced him</v>

3304
03:21:46.941 --> 03:21:51.941
<v Speaker 1>that the war had to be ended and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>some history say that the Kaiser a day </v>

3305
03:21:52.791 --> 03:21:55.820
<v Speaker 1>or two later comes to the conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>after talking with them that the war had</v>

3306
03:21:55.821 --> 03:21:58.820
<v Speaker 1>to be ended and then other histories say</v>
<v Speaker 1>other things.</v>

3307
03:21:58.821 --> 03:22:00.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how to describe all of</v>

3308
03:22:00.771 --> 03:22:05.771
<v Speaker 1>the uncertainties as people try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what really happened as </v>

3309
03:22:05.771 --> 03:22:06.920
<v Speaker 1>opposed to what ended up in the history </v>
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

3310
03:22:08.030 --> 03:22:13.030
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of evidence to suggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Ludin Dorff was more of a hard </v>

3311
03:22:13.030 --> 03:22:16.100
<v Speaker 1>liner and held out until much later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you see how again,</v>

3312
03:22:16.140 --> 03:22:21.140
<v Speaker 1>the sacrifice that's going to be made </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he may be drags his feet on </v>

3313
03:22:21.351 --> 03:22:23.030
<v Speaker 1>peace negotiations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

3314
03:22:23.390 --> 03:22:25.520
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard thing to justify after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

3315
03:22:25.670 --> 03:22:28.940
<v Speaker 1>If a decision like that costs an extra </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred or 200,000</v>

3316
03:22:28.941 --> 03:22:33.941
<v Speaker 1>casualties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you look your countrymen in the </v>

3317
03:22:33.941 --> 03:22:33.941
<v Speaker 1>eye 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 years later?</v>

3318
03:22:33.941 --> 03:22:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if I were in Luton doors,</v>

3319
03:22:36.590 --> 03:22:41.590
<v Speaker 1>shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might try after the war to shade </v>

3320
03:22:41.590 --> 03:22:43.991
<v Speaker 1>things in the best light to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean one of the tragedies during this </v>

3321
03:22:43.991 --> 03:22:48.281
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a German general who is </v>

3322
03:22:48.281 --> 03:22:50.621
<v Speaker 1>looking at the incoming list of 18 year </v>
<v Speaker 1>olds and entire age group now being </v>

3323
03:22:50.901 --> 03:22:55.901
<v Speaker 1>called up again to be thrown into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>law of this war when it's already </v>

3324
03:22:55.901 --> 03:22:58.250
<v Speaker 1>decided and he'll say too bad about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>young blood.</v>

3325
03:23:00.020 --> 03:23:05.020
<v Speaker 1>If one of those members of that new crop</v>
<v Speaker 1>of young bloods was your son and you </v>

3326
03:23:05.020 --> 03:23:08.060
<v Speaker 1>lost him in that war afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading Luton,</v>

3327
03:23:08.070 --> 03:23:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Doris memoirs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might not be too pleased either.</v>

3328
03:23:11.990 --> 03:23:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the black day of the German army </v>

3329
03:23:16.990 --> 03:23:19.901
<v Speaker 1>on August eighth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the allies will launch a series of </v>

3330
03:23:19.901 --> 03:23:23.780
<v Speaker 1>regular hammer blows at the Germans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all pretty darn awful in between</v>

3331
03:23:23.781 --> 03:23:26.210
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's tons of fighting going on.</v>

3332
03:23:26.211 --> 03:23:27.920
<v Speaker 1>You know the taking of this machine gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>nest,</v>

3333
03:23:27.921 --> 03:23:32.921
<v Speaker 1>the moving into this valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty much constant somewhere up </v>

3334
03:23:32.921 --> 03:23:32.921
<v Speaker 1>and down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the line,</v>

3335
03:23:32.921 --> 03:23:37.361
<v Speaker 1>pressure on the German army and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties because now we've reverted </v>

3336
03:23:37.361 --> 03:23:39.680
<v Speaker 1>back to open warfare again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are not hiding in trenches,</v>

3337
03:23:39.681 --> 03:23:44.681
<v Speaker 1>which let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are safer than being up above the </v>

3338
03:23:44.681 --> 03:23:48.341
<v Speaker 1>trenches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why you had trenches to begin </v>

3339
03:23:48.341 --> 03:23:50.591
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the casualties just go through the </v>

3340
03:23:50.591 --> 03:23:52.691
<v Speaker 1>roof again at a point in the war where </v>
<v Speaker 1>really they're fighting for improved </v>

3341
03:23:55.370 --> 03:23:57.350
<v Speaker 1>terms of an armistice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3342
03:23:57.360 --> 03:23:59.870
<v Speaker 1>and Ludina doors not exactly moving all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fast.</v>

3343
03:23:59.870 --> 03:24:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly the Kaiser wants to open up </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiations with the Netherlands,</v>

3344
03:24:03.650 --> 03:24:06.830
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really taken off so fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're thinking in your head,</v>

3345
03:24:06.831 --> 03:24:09.110
<v Speaker 1>as you look back on this tragedy every </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

3346
03:24:09.590 --> 03:24:12.170
<v Speaker 1>you know all these people dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just want them to hurry rush.</v>

3347
03:24:12.171 --> 03:24:13.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a time limit here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3348
03:24:13.461 --> 03:24:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Every day you get a little closer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>armageddon.</v>

3349
03:24:17.750 --> 03:24:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Armageddon is exactly what historian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Hart called this period of the </v>

3350
03:24:22.750 --> 03:24:26.531
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the period after the black day of the </v>

3351
03:24:26.531 --> 03:24:26.531
<v Speaker 1>German army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>August eighth,</v>

3352
03:24:26.531 --> 03:24:28.940
<v Speaker 1>when multiple punches keep knocking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans backward,</v>

3353
03:24:28.941 --> 03:24:33.110
<v Speaker 1>eventually knocking them back into those</v>
<v Speaker 1>prepared defenses that they had,</v>

3354
03:24:33.430 --> 03:24:38.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move forward from months ago and </v>

3355
03:24:38.430 --> 03:24:38.450
<v Speaker 1>everybody takes up their positions again</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the allies smashed through that</v>

3356
03:24:39.560 --> 03:24:42.560
<v Speaker 1>heart says quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the allied armies,</v>

3357
03:24:42.740 --> 03:24:43.830
<v Speaker 1>British,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French,</v>

3358
03:24:43.890 --> 03:24:48.030
<v Speaker 1>American and Belgian moved forward along</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the western front.</v>

3359
03:24:48.330 --> 03:24:49.600
<v Speaker 1>They were winning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

3360
03:24:49.830 --> 03:24:54.830
<v Speaker 1>but casualties were still high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a truly murderous form of </v>

3361
03:24:54.830 --> 03:24:58.941
<v Speaker 1>warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a sobering statistic that of the </v>

3362
03:24:58.941 --> 03:25:01.641
<v Speaker 1>one point 2 million men serving in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British expeditionary force between </v>

3363
03:25:02.130 --> 03:25:02.580
<v Speaker 1>August and November,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

3364
03:25:02.581 --> 03:25:05.430
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some 360,000</v>

3365
03:25:05.431 --> 03:25:08.610
<v Speaker 1>of them became casualties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was unsustainable.</v>

3366
03:25:08.790 --> 03:25:10.800
<v Speaker 1>The B e,</v>
<v Speaker 1>F was being consumed.</v>

3367
03:25:10.980 --> 03:25:12.930
<v Speaker 1>The French and Americans were also </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

3368
03:25:12.931 --> 03:25:15.450
<v Speaker 1>This was armageddon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>End Quote.</v>

3369
03:25:17.240 --> 03:25:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it reminds you of an almost tokenistic </v>

3370
03:25:22.240 --> 03:25:23.720
<v Speaker 1>situation where the good guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they win,</v>

3371
03:25:23.721 --> 03:25:25.940
<v Speaker 1>are going to be a shadow of their former</v>
<v Speaker 1>selves,</v>

3372
03:25:27.250 --> 03:25:32.250
<v Speaker 1>but if it was bad for the allies who at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least knew that they were going to win </v>

3373
03:25:32.250 --> 03:25:35.791
<v Speaker 1>this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about what it was like for the </v>

3374
03:25:35.791 --> 03:25:38.131
<v Speaker 1>people who are enduring with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that whatever they were </v>

3375
03:25:38.131 --> 03:25:41.770
<v Speaker 1>fighting for is already a moot point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me In passing him writes,</v>

3376
03:25:41.771 --> 03:25:45.190
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the Kaisers men were now utterly</v>

3377
03:25:45.191 --> 03:25:50.191
<v Speaker 1>resigned to the prospect of defeat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>despair that they fought on in places </v>

3378
03:25:50.191 --> 03:25:54.661
<v Speaker 1>with such tenacity and in such good </v>
<v Speaker 1>order and never ceases to impress an </v>

3379

<v Speaker 1>amaze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many that either witnessed it then or </v>

3380
03:25:58.321 --> 03:26:00.871
<v Speaker 1>consider it today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was also a truly awful </v>

3381
03:26:00.871 --> 03:26:03.961
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soldiers bemoaned their plight and he </v>

3382
03:26:03.961 --> 03:26:05.830
<v Speaker 1>quotes a German soldier during these </v>
<v Speaker 1>last hundred days of the war.</v>

3383
03:26:06.660 --> 03:26:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Our artillery is fired out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have too few horses are fresh troops </v>

3384
03:26:11.660 --> 03:26:16.411
<v Speaker 1>are anemic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boys in need of rest who cannot carry a </v>

3385
03:26:16.411 --> 03:26:17.950
<v Speaker 1>pack but merely know how to die by </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands.</v>

3386
03:26:18.250 --> 03:26:23.250
<v Speaker 1>They understand nothing about warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They simply go and let themselves be </v>

3387
03:26:23.250 --> 03:26:27.151
<v Speaker 1>shot down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The summer of 1918 has been the most </v>

3388
03:26:27.151 --> 03:26:30.391
<v Speaker 1>bloody and the most terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every man here knows we are losing the </v>

3389
03:26:30.391 --> 03:26:31.750
<v Speaker 1>war still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The campaign goes on,</v>

3390
03:26:31.990 --> 03:26:34.750
<v Speaker 1>the dying goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to quote</v>

3391
03:26:36.310 --> 03:26:38.830
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another guy who might not want to</v>

3392
03:26:38.831 --> 03:26:40.780
<v Speaker 1>read Luton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doris Morris.</v>

3393
03:26:40.781 --> 03:26:42.640
<v Speaker 1>After the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the war,</v>

3394
03:26:42.641 --> 03:26:44.970
<v Speaker 1>the great German historian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>military historian,</v>

3395
03:26:44.980 --> 03:26:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Hans Dell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brooke,</v>

3396
03:26:45.761 --> 03:26:50.761
<v Speaker 1>will be a scathing critique of Luton </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dorff and with the same kind of rage </v>

3397
03:26:50.761 --> 03:26:55.111
<v Speaker 1>that anyone might have from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation and even that side of the </v>

3398
03:26:55.111 --> 03:26:58.861
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you realize that maybe several </v>

3399
03:26:58.861 --> 03:26:59.350
<v Speaker 1>hundred thousand casualties were </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary.</v>

3400
03:27:00.760 --> 03:27:05.760
<v Speaker 1>As we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weird human emotion that comes into </v>

3401
03:27:05.760 --> 03:27:08.971
<v Speaker 1>play though is that when you look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifices and the endurance of these </v>

3402
03:27:08.971 --> 03:27:11.950
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't help but notice the heroism in</v>

3403
03:27:11.951 --> 03:27:12.550
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3404
03:27:12.590 --> 03:27:14.350
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange thing,</v>

3405
03:27:16.320 --> 03:27:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Lloyd George knows that though the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British prime minister in his memoirs in</v>

3406
03:27:19.441 --> 03:27:24.441
<v Speaker 1>a part that you can't really spin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes out of his way to just talk about </v>

3407
03:27:24.441 --> 03:27:27.570
<v Speaker 1>how amazing the whole thing was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

3408
03:27:27.571 --> 03:27:32.571
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ceaseless body blows delivered with </v>

3409
03:27:32.571 --> 03:27:36.531
<v Speaker 1>increasing power by the allied forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left the German army breathless and </v>

3410
03:27:36.531 --> 03:27:41.211
<v Speaker 1>helpless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is fair to acknowledge that they </v>

3411
03:27:41.211 --> 03:27:42.550
<v Speaker 1>retreated fighting for every kilometer </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they ultimately</v>

3412
03:27:42.550 --> 03:27:46.540
<v Speaker 4>had to concede.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was not a chase and hardly a pursuit,</v>

3413
03:27:46.780 --> 03:27:48.670
<v Speaker 4>starved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>decimated,</v>

3414
03:27:48.790 --> 03:27:53.790
<v Speaker 4>despairing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The German soldiers fought on making us </v>

3415
03:27:53.790 --> 03:27:57.481
<v Speaker 4>pay a heavy price for every mile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We wrestled from them throughout the </v>

3416
03:27:57.481 --> 03:28:01.171
<v Speaker 4>whole war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Germans had shown themselves dowdy </v>

3417
03:28:01.171 --> 03:28:03.691
<v Speaker 4>fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was nothing finer in their </v>

3418
03:28:03.691 --> 03:28:06.031
<v Speaker 4>record than the pluck with which they </v>
<v Speaker 4>continue to withstand us in the hour of </v>

3419
03:28:06.031 --> 03:28:06.730
<v Speaker 4>their defeat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They could not,</v>

3420
03:28:06.731 --> 03:28:10.420
<v Speaker 4>but know that they were beaten at home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their families were starving.</v>

3421
03:28:10.720 --> 03:28:14.110
<v Speaker 4>Yet in the month of October,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the last whole month of the war,</v>

3422
03:28:14.320 --> 03:28:17.400
<v Speaker 4>the British forces in France suffered </v>
<v Speaker 4>over 120,000</v>

3423
03:28:17.410 --> 03:28:22.180
<v Speaker 4>battle casualties as evidence of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>resistance they encountered between July</v>

3424
03:28:22.181 --> 03:28:27.181
<v Speaker 4>first and the conclusion of hostilities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the British battle casualties in </v>

3425
03:28:27.181 --> 03:28:30.991
<v Speaker 4>fighting a beaten pho and a foe that </v>
<v Speaker 4>knew he was beaten on every front </v>

3426
03:28:31.090 --> 03:28:36.090
<v Speaker 4>totaled 430,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>killed wounded prisoners and missing </v>

3427
03:28:36.090 --> 03:28:39.700
<v Speaker 4>during practically the same period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The French lost 531,000</v>

3428
03:28:39.701 --> 03:28:44.701
<v Speaker 4>men and the Americans over 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>let us do honor to a brave people with </v>

3429
03:28:45.431 --> 03:28:47.830
<v Speaker 4>whom we've had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one deadly quarrel.</v>

3430
03:28:48.040 --> 03:28:53.040
<v Speaker 4>They fought to the end with desperate </v>
<v Speaker 4>valor and quote American historian Scott</v>

3431
03:28:55.590 --> 03:29:00.590
<v Speaker 4>Stevenson wrote quote to be a German </v>
<v Speaker 4>defender in the path of a major allied </v>

3432
03:29:01.021 --> 03:29:05.940
<v Speaker 4>attack late in the war was to experience</v>
<v Speaker 4>the horrors of Dante's inferno</v>

3433
03:29:07.360 --> 03:29:11.200
<v Speaker 4>and quote and truthfully,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you read the stories,</v>

3434
03:29:11.830 --> 03:29:14.860
<v Speaker 4>they sound like they could come from any</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of this nightmare.</v>

3435
03:29:15.700 --> 03:29:20.050
<v Speaker 4>The worst tragedy here is that you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>the feeling like all of this is,</v>

3436
03:29:20.700 --> 03:29:23.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming after the time when this conflict</v>

3437
03:29:23.021 --> 03:29:27.010
<v Speaker 4>should be ended already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If the whole thing is already tragic.</v>

3438
03:29:27.011 --> 03:29:28.690
<v Speaker 4>This is the extra tragic part.</v>

3439
03:29:30.110 --> 03:29:33.980
<v Speaker 4>Historian Nick Lloyd talks about a </v>
<v Speaker 4>German gunner named Ernst Keel.</v>

3440
03:29:33.981 --> 03:29:38.981
<v Speaker 4>Meyer who recorded in his diary about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fighting going on in late September,</v>

3441
03:29:39.141 --> 03:29:42.380
<v Speaker 4>early October.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He writes about his experience of coming</v>

3442
03:29:42.381 --> 03:29:45.380
<v Speaker 4>under sustained British artillery </v>
<v Speaker 4>bombardment,</v>

3443
03:29:45.381 --> 03:29:50.381
<v Speaker 4>including a direct hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He talks about three men and says that </v>

3444
03:29:50.381 --> 03:29:52.730
<v Speaker 4>they were quote torn apart beyond </v>
<v Speaker 4>recognition.</v>

3445
03:29:53.340 --> 03:29:54.770
<v Speaker 4>And then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh Lord,</v>

3446
03:29:54.771 --> 03:29:56.840
<v Speaker 4>what a Monday morning and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

3447
03:29:57.110 --> 03:30:00.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm firing on gun number four all day in</v>
<v Speaker 4>between,</v>

3448
03:30:00.831 --> 03:30:04.400
<v Speaker 4>we picked up the pieces of bone and </v>
<v Speaker 4>flesh and put them in a box.</v>

3449
03:30:04.640 --> 03:30:09.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm mark them with a red pencil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my companion at all times so that the </v>

3450
03:30:09.640 --> 03:30:13.691
<v Speaker 4>cemetery official will know as their </v>
<v Speaker 4>metal plates with names and ranks could </v>

3451
03:30:13.691 --> 03:30:15.830
<v Speaker 4>not be found.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Try to pick up three heads,</v>

3452
03:30:15.950 --> 03:30:20.690
<v Speaker 4>six arms and feet and whatever else </v>
<v Speaker 4>there is left from your friends then.</v>

3453
03:30:20.790 --> 03:30:23.330
<v Speaker 4>And the historian Nick Lloyd Wright's </v>
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

3454
03:30:23.990 --> 03:30:28.990
<v Speaker 4>Keel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meyer was understandably traumatized by </v>

3455
03:30:28.990 --> 03:30:28.990
<v Speaker 4>his experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Quote,</v>

3456
03:30:29.180 --> 03:30:31.580
<v Speaker 4>if that's how three of us die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wrote,</v>

3457
03:30:31.790 --> 03:30:34.010
<v Speaker 4>I hope their families will never find </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

3458
03:30:34.400 --> 03:30:35.150
<v Speaker 4>And to quote,</v>

3459
03:30:37.070 --> 03:30:39.530
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as we've done it earlier in this piece,</v>

3460
03:30:39.531 --> 03:30:44.531
<v Speaker 4>I want to emphasize that these are the </v>
<v Speaker 4>survivors who go home and make the post </v>

3461
03:30:46.341 --> 03:30:50.630
<v Speaker 4>first world war world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the user water in their memory banks.</v>

3462
03:30:50.660 --> 03:30:55.660
<v Speaker 4>These are what they carry with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are what influenced their </v>

3463
03:30:55.660 --> 03:30:55.820
<v Speaker 4>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their standards,</v>

3464
03:30:56.060 --> 03:30:59.900
<v Speaker 4>their expectations and influences what </v>
<v Speaker 4>they want.</v>

3465
03:31:00.410 --> 03:31:05.410
<v Speaker 4>The bitterness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is part of of what odd off Hitler </v>

3466
03:31:05.410 --> 03:31:07.190
<v Speaker 4>is trying to touch in his audience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>reading his book,</v>

3467
03:31:07.191 --> 03:31:12.191
<v Speaker 4>mine comp is the sort of bitterness that</v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences like this generate and they </v>

3468
03:31:12.591 --> 03:31:15.680
<v Speaker 4>do so in an entire generation after this</v>
<v Speaker 4>war,</v>

3469
03:31:15.980 --> 03:31:19.670
<v Speaker 4>the British and the French will also </v>
<v Speaker 4>have their poets and they're writers and</v>

3470
03:31:19.671 --> 03:31:24.671
<v Speaker 4>they're thinkers and they're politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean when one wonders why they seem so</v>

3471
03:31:24.771 --> 03:31:27.590
<v Speaker 4>willing to do whatever it took before </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Second World War,</v>

3472
03:31:27.800 --> 03:31:30.830
<v Speaker 4>even if it did involve what we call </v>
<v Speaker 4>today appeasement,</v>

3473
03:31:31.160 --> 03:31:36.160
<v Speaker 4>look at what were in those people's </v>
<v Speaker 4>memory banks doing all those </v>

3474
03:31:36.160 --> 03:31:40.511
<v Speaker 4>negotiations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The vast majority of the people that </v>

3475
03:31:40.511 --> 03:31:43.961
<v Speaker 4>will be in decision making positions </v>
<v Speaker 4>militarily and politically where people </v>

3476
03:31:43.961 --> 03:31:48.731
<v Speaker 4>who were in the first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at what they went through </v>

3477
03:31:48.770 --> 03:31:50.180
<v Speaker 4>and think of how it changed them</v>

3478
03:31:52.140 --> 03:31:55.350
<v Speaker 4>as autumn was beginning to turn to </v>
<v Speaker 4>November in 1918.</v>

3479
03:31:55.590 --> 03:32:00.590
<v Speaker 4>Optimists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're beginning to think that this work </v>

3480
03:32:00.590 --> 03:32:00.590
<v Speaker 4>could be won in 19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>19.</v>

3481
03:32:00.590 --> 03:32:03.240
<v Speaker 4>Pessimists still pointed out maybe 19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 was more realistic.</v>

3482
03:32:03.540 --> 03:32:06.510
<v Speaker 4>If the Germans began a step by step dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a defense,</v>

3483
03:32:06.511 --> 03:32:08.070
<v Speaker 4>they could hold out for a long time.</v>

3484
03:32:09.650 --> 03:32:11.000
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's worth pointing out too because it's</v>

3485
03:32:11.001 --> 03:32:16.001
<v Speaker 4>kind of important that the Germans </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't on German soil yet they're </v>

3486
03:32:16.001 --> 03:32:18.971
<v Speaker 4>retreating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're still on conquered </v>

3487
03:32:18.971 --> 03:32:20.831
<v Speaker 4>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something that they will continually </v>

3488
03:32:20.831 --> 03:32:20.831
<v Speaker 4>tell themselves was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3489
03:32:20.831 --> 03:32:25.630
<v Speaker 4>a a sign that they were never defeated </v>
<v Speaker 4>and something politicians after the war </v>

3490
03:32:25.630 --> 03:32:30.311
<v Speaker 4>will play up to write the never defeated</v>
<v Speaker 4>German army always on conquered </v>

3491
03:32:30.311 --> 03:32:33.731
<v Speaker 4>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're being battered pillar to </v>

3492
03:32:33.731 --> 03:32:33.731
<v Speaker 4>post during this last hundred days </v>
<v Speaker 4>offensive.</v>

3493
03:32:34.700 --> 03:32:37.730
<v Speaker 4>They will retreat at one point to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>old Hindenburg line.</v>

3494
03:32:37.731 --> 03:32:39.920
<v Speaker 4>These great defenses are going to make a</v>
<v Speaker 4>stand.</v>

3495
03:32:39.921 --> 03:32:44.921
<v Speaker 4>They'll never break the Hindenburg line </v>
<v Speaker 4>and an American and French forces </v>

3496
03:32:44.921 --> 03:32:47.981
<v Speaker 4>breakthrough the Hindenburg line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ironically though,</v>

3497
03:32:48.771 --> 03:32:53.771
<v Speaker 4>considering all of the debates the </v>
<v Speaker 4>allied commanders and politicians had </v>

3498
03:32:53.771 --> 03:32:55.370
<v Speaker 4>been having for years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the eastern or Western or debate,</v>

3499
03:32:55.371 --> 03:32:57.080
<v Speaker 4>where do you put the troops?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where do you win the war?</v>

3500
03:32:57.081 --> 03:33:02.081
<v Speaker 4>Western front or someplace else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's someplace else that collapses </v>

3501
03:33:02.081 --> 03:33:02.081
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>

3502
03:33:03.020 --> 03:33:05.780
<v Speaker 4>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's what's called the Balkan front,</v>

3503
03:33:05.781 --> 03:33:09.890
<v Speaker 4>and for years the allies had been slowly</v>
<v Speaker 4>but surely building up forces in a place</v>

3504
03:33:09.891 --> 03:33:12.380
<v Speaker 4>called Salonika in Greece and doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing with the.</v>

3505
03:33:12.381 --> 03:33:17.381
<v Speaker 4>Mainly the British especially joked that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were the gardeners of Salonica </v>

3506
03:33:18.450 --> 03:33:22.130
<v Speaker 4>because they were just sitting around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A Greek army eventually joins the French</v>

3507
03:33:22.131 --> 03:33:24.850
<v Speaker 4>and British army that's there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the army of Serbia.</v>

3508
03:33:24.860 --> 03:33:29.860
<v Speaker 4>Remember Serbia has been conquered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taken over out of the war now for a </v>

3509
03:33:29.860 --> 03:33:30.230
<v Speaker 4>couple of years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but their army fled with the king at the</v>

3510
03:33:30.231 --> 03:33:33.320
<v Speaker 4>head and they've been reconstituted here</v>
<v Speaker 4>at Salonica,</v>

3511
03:33:33.710 --> 03:33:38.710
<v Speaker 4>but more people are dying from malaria </v>
<v Speaker 4>there than any military fighting and </v>

3512
03:33:38.710 --> 03:33:38.710
<v Speaker 4>then all of</v>

3513
03:33:38.710 --> 03:33:39.750
<v Speaker 1>a sudden in September 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

3514
03:33:40.020 --> 03:33:44.970
<v Speaker 1>the allies strike there against a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Bulgarians who are poorly supplied,</v>

3515
03:33:44.971 --> 03:33:49.971
<v Speaker 1>poorly motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and certainly not ready to be hit by </v>

3516
03:33:49.971 --> 03:33:52.701
<v Speaker 1>what is now more than 400,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>allied troops and they collapse.</v>

3517
03:33:54.470 --> 03:33:59.470
<v Speaker 1>This imperils everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's funny because if you read the </v>

3518
03:33:59.470 --> 03:34:02.751
<v Speaker 1>Western history is written by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British and the French and the </v>

3519
03:34:02.751 --> 03:34:02.751
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clear that to them,</v>

3520
03:34:02.751 --> 03:34:05.760
<v Speaker 1>this is a side show thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It barely gets a mention sometimes,</v>

3521
03:34:06.030 --> 03:34:09.810
<v Speaker 1>but if you read German accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a catastrophe.</v>

3522
03:34:10.260 --> 03:34:13.290
<v Speaker 1>They get their oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of their food from this area.</v>

3523
03:34:13.980 --> 03:34:18.980
<v Speaker 1>This will certainly be the last car for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ostrow Hungarians who are teetering </v>

3524
03:34:18.980 --> 03:34:22.650
<v Speaker 1>anyway because this is right by them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Ottoman Empire,</v>

3525
03:34:22.850 --> 03:34:25.020
<v Speaker 1>you know is one second away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsing too.</v>

3526
03:34:25.260 --> 03:34:30.260
<v Speaker 1>This is sort of a final straw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's when Bulgaria drops out of the </v>

3527
03:34:30.260 --> 03:34:34.020
<v Speaker 1>war and September 29th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Luton door finally breaks down.</v>

3528
03:34:34.860 --> 03:34:35.520
<v Speaker 1>No ifs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ands,</v>

3529
03:34:35.521 --> 03:34:40.521
<v Speaker 1>or buts about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes to the Kaiser and says that the </v>

3530
03:34:40.521 --> 03:34:42.360
<v Speaker 1>war must be ended right away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need in our midst us right now.</v>

3531
03:34:42.420 --> 03:34:46.350
<v Speaker 1>I can't guarantee that the army will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to stand another 24 hours.</v>

3532
03:34:47.400 --> 03:34:49.710
<v Speaker 1>The German government contacts Woodrow </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wilson,</v>

3533
03:34:49.711 --> 03:34:51.960
<v Speaker 1>hoping that they can get a nice deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Americans,</v>

3534
03:34:51.961 --> 03:34:54.390
<v Speaker 1>whereas the British and the French are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not feeling very charitable.</v>

3535
03:34:54.750 --> 03:34:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Wilson still has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has his idealistic 14 points out there </v>

3536
03:34:59.750 --> 03:35:00.120
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the Germans can get that deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

3537
03:35:00.130 --> 03:35:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Looks a lot better to them while they </v>
<v Speaker 1>retreating than it did while they were </v>

3538
03:35:05.130 --> 03:35:05.130
<v Speaker 1>advancing</v>

3539
03:35:06.600 --> 03:35:10.770
<v Speaker 1>and as German military historian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hans Dell Brooke Rights,</v>

3540
03:35:10.771 --> 03:35:15.750
<v Speaker 1>and this is the most painful event he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever lived through,</v>

3541
03:35:16.350 --> 03:35:21.350
<v Speaker 1>and he writes this at the time to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>German public and as the editor of the </v>

3542
03:35:21.631 --> 03:35:26.631
<v Speaker 1>book points out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something that would have been </v>

3543
03:35:26.631 --> 03:35:26.631
<v Speaker 1>censored three weeks before he wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3544
03:35:26.631 --> 03:35:29.080
<v Speaker 1>It was so anti war or defeatist or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to say,</v>

3545
03:35:29.081 --> 03:35:34.081
<v Speaker 1>but now at this point in the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's allowed to openly say something </v>

3546
03:35:34.081 --> 03:35:35.970
<v Speaker 1>like this quote.</v>

3547
03:35:37.210 --> 03:35:39.730
<v Speaker 4>The same day I completed the previous </v>
<v Speaker 4>volume,</v>

3548
03:35:39.880 --> 03:35:42.610
<v Speaker 4>the most terrible fate we feared </v>
<v Speaker 4>overcame us.</v>

3549
03:35:42.880 --> 03:35:46.030
<v Speaker 4>Our Se front in the Balkans broke </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely open.</v>

3550
03:35:46.240 --> 03:35:49.300
<v Speaker 4>The Bulgarians were defeated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their king abdicated,</v>

3551
03:35:49.420 --> 03:35:51.520
<v Speaker 4>and the army of the entente that it's so</v>
<v Speaker 4>long.</v>

3552
03:35:51.521 --> 03:35:55.960
<v Speaker 4>Defendant Salonica was on the march to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Danube River in Syria.</v>

3553
03:35:55.961 --> 03:36:00.961
<v Speaker 4>The English not only fought but </v>
<v Speaker 4>destroyed a Turkish army and took </v>

3554
03:36:00.961 --> 03:36:04.351
<v Speaker 4>Damascus in Constantinople.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The German allied Turkish government of </v>

3555
03:36:04.351 --> 03:36:08.461
<v Speaker 4>ever Talmud is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will not be long before the English </v>

3556
03:36:08.461 --> 03:36:09.790
<v Speaker 4>fleet has free access to the Black Sea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Austria,</v>

3557
03:36:09.791 --> 03:36:13.270
<v Speaker 4>Hungary is also in full disillusion on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the western front.</v>

3558
03:36:13.480 --> 03:36:18.480
<v Speaker 4>Our hope that the enemy offensive would </v>
<v Speaker 4>not pass through our siegfried line is </v>

3559
03:36:18.480 --> 03:36:20.860
<v Speaker 4>unfulfilled under heavy losses of </v>
<v Speaker 4>prisoners and material,</v>

3560
03:36:21.010 --> 03:36:23.560
<v Speaker 4>our army retreats from one place to </v>
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>

3561
03:36:23.770 --> 03:36:28.770
<v Speaker 4>the superiority of our combined enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only in men but also in material </v>

3562
03:36:28.770 --> 03:36:33.630
<v Speaker 4>airplanes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tanks and munitions far exceeds </v>

3563
03:36:33.630 --> 03:36:36.061
<v Speaker 4>expectations and calculations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we remember how strong we to the </v>

3564
03:36:36.061 --> 03:36:36.880
<v Speaker 4>world this past spring</v>

3565
03:36:37.030 --> 03:36:42.030
<v Speaker 1>and our battlefield successes from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>21st of March through June are sudden </v>

3566
03:36:42.030 --> 03:36:46.381
<v Speaker 1>reverses hard to believe and quote on </v>
<v Speaker 1>October 30th.</v>

3567
03:36:46.931 --> 03:36:51.931
<v Speaker 1>The Ottomans drop out of the war on </v>
<v Speaker 1>November third.</v>

3568
03:36:53.670 --> 03:36:58.100
<v Speaker 1>The Austrians do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While all this is going on,</v>

3569
03:36:58.101 --> 03:37:03.101
<v Speaker 1>you have this very weird almost month </v>
<v Speaker 1>long period where negotiations are </v>

3570
03:37:03.261 --> 03:37:08.261
<v Speaker 1>opening and going on behind the scenes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and everybody begins to get the </v>

3571
03:37:08.261 --> 03:37:09.560
<v Speaker 1>impression that things are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the mood is quickening.</v>

3572
03:37:09.561 --> 03:37:12.590
<v Speaker 1>The war is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is winding to some sort of a conclusion,</v>

3573
03:37:12.591 --> 03:37:14.690
<v Speaker 1>but people are still dying in mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

3574
03:37:16.370 --> 03:37:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Some in the higher ups of the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>navy decide that if the war is going to </v>

3575
03:37:21.370 --> 03:37:25.861
<v Speaker 1>end like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German navy is going to go out </v>

3576
03:37:25.861 --> 03:37:29.080
<v Speaker 1>heroically and they come up with an idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>for an imperial navy death ride to </v>

3577
03:37:32.270 --> 03:37:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Sally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out with everything you have taken on </v>

3578
03:37:37.270 --> 03:37:39.881
<v Speaker 1>the British fleet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when a giant head to head </v>

3579
03:37:39.881 --> 03:37:40.580
<v Speaker 1>battle and go down fighting and take as </v>
<v Speaker 1>many of them with you as you can,</v>

3580
03:37:42.050 --> 03:37:47.050
<v Speaker 1>which sounds heroic and wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're some admiral somewhere when </v>

3581
03:37:47.050 --> 03:37:51.491
<v Speaker 1>news that this is what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaches the sailors in the fleet though </v>

3582
03:37:51.491 --> 03:37:53.240
<v Speaker 1>who can also see that the war is winding</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

3583
03:37:53.241 --> 03:37:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's going to get to go home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible,</v>

3584
03:37:55.281 --> 03:38:00.281
<v Speaker 1>but it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they find out they get to be </v>

3585
03:38:00.281 --> 03:38:02.030
<v Speaker 1>part of some death ride to save some </v>
<v Speaker 1>honor for a fleet that isn't going to be</v>

3586
03:38:02.031 --> 03:38:05.930
<v Speaker 1>around whether the death ride happens or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

3587
03:38:05.960 --> 03:38:08.390
<v Speaker 1>In a months time they say no</v>

3588
03:38:09.830 --> 03:38:14.830
<v Speaker 1>and they begin to rebel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Riot is not too strong of a word.</v>

3589
03:38:15.501 --> 03:38:19.010
<v Speaker 1>First they have mutineers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mutineers are captured.</v>

3590
03:38:19.370 --> 03:38:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Then the rest of the fleets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sailors get upset about the mutineers </v>

3591
03:38:24.370 --> 03:38:24.370
<v Speaker 1>and long story short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they end up,</v>

3592
03:38:24.500 --> 03:38:25.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running through the streets,</v>

3593
03:38:25.730 --> 03:38:30.730
<v Speaker 1>taking over the naval city of Keel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they send out runners to other </v>

3594
03:38:31.311 --> 03:38:34.640
<v Speaker 1>nearby cities and they begin to spread </v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea,</v>

3595
03:38:34.641 --> 03:38:39.641
<v Speaker 1>not that dissimilar from ideas that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>being spread in Russia the year before.</v>

3596
03:38:40.970 --> 03:38:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Here is the fire from Luton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doris Neighbor's apartment,</v>

3597
03:38:45.831 --> 03:38:47.810
<v Speaker 1>finally taking flame in Germany</v>

3598
03:38:49.220 --> 03:38:54.220
<v Speaker 1>and there's been a lot of analysis as to</v>
<v Speaker 1>how Bolshevik oriented some of this is </v>

3599
03:38:54.220 --> 03:38:58.600
<v Speaker 1>and the truth is most of it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The left in Germany runs the gamut from </v>

3600
03:38:58.600 --> 03:39:03.461
<v Speaker 1>mild Social Democrats all the way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardcore what are called spartacists and</v>

3601
03:39:03.770 --> 03:39:08.770
<v Speaker 1>everything in between and part of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>will happen over the next six months in </v>

3602
03:39:08.770 --> 03:39:12.641
<v Speaker 1>Germany will happen because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement on the left at all as to what </v>

3603
03:39:12.641 --> 03:39:15.440
<v Speaker 1>should happen except that they're pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>darn unified about one thing.</v>

3604
03:39:15.830 --> 03:39:20.830
<v Speaker 1>The war shouldn't happen anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as these people spread to other </v>

3605
03:39:20.830 --> 03:39:24.080
<v Speaker 1>locations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>city after city goes revolutionary.</v>

3606
03:39:25.490 --> 03:39:30.490
<v Speaker 1>The great journalist Philip Gibbs who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was with the allied entente armies as </v>

3607
03:39:30.490 --> 03:39:33.821
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they battered the Germans back </v>

3608
03:39:33.821 --> 03:39:33.821
<v Speaker 1>towards Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3609
03:39:33.821 --> 03:39:33.980
<v Speaker 1>thinks everything they've been</v>

3610
03:39:33.980 --> 03:39:35.660
<v Speaker 4>through through these years of war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He writes,</v>

3611
03:39:35.661 --> 03:39:39.080
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thought of all the losses on the way</v>

3612
03:39:39.200 --> 03:39:43.190
<v Speaker 4>and evolve the futility of this strife </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoked at one's heart.</v>

3613
03:39:43.640 --> 03:39:45.890
<v Speaker 4>What fools the Germans had been?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

3614
03:39:45.891 --> 03:39:49.490
<v Speaker 4>Tragic fools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a mad villainy there had been among</v>

3615
03:39:49.491 --> 03:39:53.780
<v Speaker 4>rival dynasties and powers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>politicians and people's to lead to this</v>

3616
03:39:53.781 --> 03:39:56.840
<v Speaker 4>massacre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What had one gained out of it all?</v>

3617
03:39:57.080 --> 03:40:02.080
<v Speaker 4>Nothing except ruin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing except great death and poverty </v>

3618
03:40:02.080 --> 03:40:05.750
<v Speaker 4>and remorse and revolt and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and as the German armies are collapsing,</v>

3619
03:40:05.840 --> 03:40:08.480
<v Speaker 4>gibbs points out that it's not a moment </v>
<v Speaker 4>too soon.</v>

3620
03:40:08.600 --> 03:40:09.320
<v Speaker 4>He writes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

3621
03:40:10.160 --> 03:40:15.160
<v Speaker 4>the British Army could not have gone </v>
<v Speaker 4>much farther after November 11th when </v>

3622
03:40:15.160 --> 03:40:17.120
<v Speaker 4>the our misdose brought us to a halt for</v>
<v Speaker 4>three months.</v>

3623
03:40:17.121 --> 03:40:20.900
<v Speaker 4>Our troops had fought incessantly </v>
<v Speaker 4>storming many villages strongly.</v>

3624
03:40:20.901 --> 03:40:24.680
<v Speaker 4>Garrison with machine gunners crossing </v>
<v Speaker 4>many canals under heavy fire,</v>

3625
03:40:24.830 --> 03:40:29.270
<v Speaker 4>losing many comrades all along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The pace could not have been kept up.</v>

3626
03:40:29.540 --> 03:40:32.000
<v Speaker 4>There is a limit even to the valor of </v>
<v Speaker 4>British troops.</v>

3627
03:40:32.001 --> 03:40:33.680
<v Speaker 4>And for a time we had reached that </v>
<v Speaker 4>limit,</v>

3628
03:40:34.310 --> 03:40:39.310
<v Speaker 4>there were not many divisions who could </v>
<v Speaker 4>have staggered onto new attacks without </v>

3629
03:40:39.310 --> 03:40:41.840
<v Speaker 4>rest and relief.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He then goes on to talk about the French</v>

3630
03:40:41.990 --> 03:40:45.160
<v Speaker 4>and the Americans and then says quote </v>
<v Speaker 4>before them,</v>

3631
03:40:45.170 --> 03:40:50.170
<v Speaker 4>the German troops were in revolt at last</v>
<v Speaker 4>against the bloody futile sacrifices of </v>

3632
03:40:50.901 --> 03:40:55.901
<v Speaker 4>their manhood and people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a blinding light had come to them </v>

3633
03:40:55.901 --> 03:40:59.620
<v Speaker 4>revealing the criminality of their war </v>
<v Speaker 4>lords in this great swindle against </v>

3634
03:40:59.620 --> 03:41:03.821
<v Speaker 4>their race.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was defeat and agony which </v>

3635
03:41:03.821 --> 03:41:06.731
<v Speaker 4>enlightened them as most people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even ourselves are enlightened only by </v>

3636
03:41:06.731 --> 03:41:08.870
<v Speaker 4>suffering and disillusionment and never </v>
<v Speaker 4>buy successes.</v>

3637
03:41:09.680 --> 03:41:14.680
<v Speaker 4>And quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you read mine comp this moment in the</v>

3638
03:41:15.321 --> 03:41:20.321
<v Speaker 4>war is the crucible of Hitler's life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he says,</v>

3639
03:41:20.571 --> 03:41:23.050
<v Speaker 4>basically what Gibbs said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3640
03:41:23.051 --> 03:41:28.051
<v Speaker 4>when he finds out about what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is recovering from a gas attack in </v>

3641
03:41:28.191 --> 03:41:33.191
<v Speaker 4>the hospital and he finds out that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>war is essentially winding down to in </v>

3642
03:41:33.341 --> 03:41:38.341
<v Speaker 4>our misdose and the German government </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the allies and especially Woodrow </v>

3643
03:41:38.341 --> 03:41:38.900
<v Speaker 4>Wilson or negotiating back and forth as </v>
<v Speaker 4>people die.</v>

3644
03:41:39.020 --> 03:41:44.020
<v Speaker 4>And Hitler freaks out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he writes about it in mind </v>

3645
03:41:44.020 --> 03:41:48.000
<v Speaker 4>comp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In a way that is tactically brilliant,</v>

3646
03:41:48.050 --> 03:41:53.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean Hitler is a demagogue of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>highest order and knows exactly what </v>

3647
03:41:53.301 --> 03:41:57.230
<v Speaker 4>buttons to push in his audience and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>knows that this audience,</v>

3648
03:41:57.440 --> 03:41:58.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 years,</v>

3649
03:41:58.460 --> 03:42:03.460
<v Speaker 4>15 years after the war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not even that long in some cases are </v>

3650
03:42:03.460 --> 03:42:07.880
<v Speaker 4>still in shock and denial and disbelief </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the bitterness that they're drowning</v>

3651
03:42:07.881 --> 03:42:11.990
<v Speaker 4>in thinking of what was lost and who </v>
<v Speaker 4>they knew who was lost in the limbs that</v>

3652
03:42:11.991 --> 03:42:14.180
<v Speaker 4>they had lost and the lives that had </v>
<v Speaker 4>changed.</v>

3653
03:42:14.450 --> 03:42:19.450
<v Speaker 4>He knew that those buttons were ripe for</v>
<v Speaker 4>exploiting and yet at the same time </v>

3654
03:42:20.181 --> 03:42:23.240
<v Speaker 4>demagogue and manipulator though he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hitler,</v>

3655
03:42:23.241 --> 03:42:28.241
<v Speaker 4>understood those buttons really well </v>
<v Speaker 4>because those were actually the same </v>

3656
03:42:28.241 --> 03:42:31.590
<v Speaker 4>buttons that he was so affected by.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wrote this in mind comp and remember,</v>

3657
03:42:31.591 --> 03:42:32.070
<v Speaker 4>imagine</v>

3658
03:42:32.070 --> 03:42:35.400
<v Speaker 1>reading this as one of those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there without an alarm.</v>

3659
03:42:35.580 --> 03:42:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen years after the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tortured by that experience still Hitler</v>

3660
03:42:41.881 --> 03:42:42.540
<v Speaker 1>says quote,</v>

3661
03:42:43.600 --> 03:42:46.240
<v Speaker 4>and so it had all been in vain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in vain.</v>

3662
03:42:46.241 --> 03:42:49.390
<v Speaker 4>All the sacrifices and privations in </v>
<v Speaker 4>vain.</v>

3663
03:42:49.391 --> 03:42:53.680
<v Speaker 4>The hunger and thirst of months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which were often endless in vain.</v>

3664
03:42:53.681 --> 03:42:56.770
<v Speaker 4>The hours in which with mortal fear </v>
<v Speaker 4>clutching our hearts,</v>

3665
03:42:56.771 --> 03:43:01.771
<v Speaker 4>we nevertheless did our duty and in vain</v>
<v Speaker 4>the deaths of two millions who died </v>

3666
03:43:01.771 --> 03:43:06.750
<v Speaker 4>would not the graves of all the hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 4>of thousands open the graves of those </v>

3667
03:43:06.750 --> 03:43:08.860
<v Speaker 4>who have faith in the fatherland had </v>
<v Speaker 4>marched fourth,</v>

3668
03:43:08.861 --> 03:43:13.861
<v Speaker 4>never to return,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would they not open and send the silent </v>

3669
03:43:13.861 --> 03:43:17.731
<v Speaker 4>mud and blood covered heroes back as </v>
<v Speaker 4>spirits of vengeance to the homeland </v>

3670
03:43:17.731 --> 03:43:22.290
<v Speaker 4>which had cheated them with such mockery</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the highest sacrifices which a man </v>

3671
03:43:22.290 --> 03:43:24.460
<v Speaker 4>can make to his people in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had they died for this,</v>

3672
03:43:24.730 --> 03:43:29.730
<v Speaker 4>the soldiers of August and September 19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>14 was it for this in the autumn of the </v>

3673
03:43:30.520 --> 03:43:33.970
<v Speaker 4>same year that the volunteer regiments </v>
<v Speaker 4>marched out after their old comrades.</v>

3674
03:43:34.210 --> 03:43:38.230
<v Speaker 4>Was it for this that the boys have 17 </v>
<v Speaker 4>sank into the earth of flanders.</v>

3675
03:43:38.620 --> 03:43:43.620
<v Speaker 4>Was this the meaning of the sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 4>which the German mother made to the </v>

3676
03:43:43.620 --> 03:43:45.400
<v Speaker 4>father,</v>
<v Speaker 4>land with sore heart as she let her best</v>

3677
03:43:45.401 --> 03:43:48.430
<v Speaker 4>love boys march off never to see them </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

3678
03:43:48.760 --> 03:43:53.110
<v Speaker 4>Did all this happen only so that a gang </v>
<v Speaker 4>of wretched criminals could lay hands on</v>

3679
03:43:53.111 --> 03:43:53.850
<v Speaker 4>the fatherland</v>

3680
03:43:54.850 --> 03:43:59.840
<v Speaker 1>end quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This bitterness was not just on the side</v>

3681
03:43:59.841 --> 03:44:04.841
<v Speaker 1>of the central powers who lost this war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though corporate Louis Bar toss in the </v>

3682
03:44:04.841 --> 03:44:06.890
<v Speaker 1>French army is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if nothing else,</v>

3683
03:44:06.950 --> 03:44:10.850
<v Speaker 1>almost in sympathy with the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>veterans.</v>

3684
03:44:11.570 --> 03:44:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Many of these people felt cheated by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing,</v>

3685
03:44:14.660 --> 03:44:19.410
<v Speaker 1>disillusioned by the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploited even barter.</v>

3686
03:44:19.411 --> 03:44:24.411
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like he feels more sympathy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>his German enemy than he does for the </v>

3687
03:44:24.891 --> 03:44:29.891
<v Speaker 1>people you know that in his mind anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bartos is a socialist and believes that </v>

3688
03:44:29.891 --> 03:44:31.760
<v Speaker 1>the people running the world are kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the enemy.</v>

3689
03:44:32.420 --> 03:44:33.170
<v Speaker 1>He writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote.</v>

3690
03:44:33.800 --> 03:44:38.800
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the great drama was reaching its </v>

3691
03:44:38.800 --> 03:44:40.430
<v Speaker 4>conclusion alone against 20 nations </v>
<v Speaker 4>baying after her Rena.</v>

3692
03:44:40.431 --> 03:44:42.680
<v Speaker 4>Fantastic clamor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Germany,</v>

3693
03:44:42.770 --> 03:44:47.140
<v Speaker 4>so proud in 1914 now on its knees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>asked for mercy,</v>

3694
03:44:47.330 --> 03:44:52.330
<v Speaker 4>asked for armistice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this way of fleeing the war didn't </v>

3695
03:44:52.330 --> 03:44:54.860
<v Speaker 4>appeal to the striped sleeves who didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>have their fill of crosses.</v>

3696
03:44:54.920 --> 03:44:56.030
<v Speaker 4>Metals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stars,</v>

3697
03:44:56.031 --> 03:44:57.020
<v Speaker 4>stripes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ribbons,</v>

3698
03:44:57.021 --> 03:44:59.330
<v Speaker 4>honors and glories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For these folks,</v>

3699
03:44:59.450 --> 03:45:04.450
<v Speaker 4>war had to end with total disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For the German army against which Jenna </v>

3700
03:45:04.940 --> 03:45:07.040
<v Speaker 4>Waterloo and sit down would be mere </v>
<v Speaker 4>skirmishes.</v>

3701
03:45:07.310 --> 03:45:12.310
<v Speaker 4>Thousands of captured cannon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hundreds of thousands of captured </v>

3702
03:45:12.310 --> 03:45:16.100
<v Speaker 4>bushes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shattered enemy forces streaming back </v>

3703
03:45:16.100 --> 03:45:18.521
<v Speaker 4>across the Rhine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bridges pursued with bayonets at their </v>

3704
03:45:18.521 --> 03:45:21.521
<v Speaker 4>backs by our soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our regimens entering the great cities </v>

3705
03:45:21.521 --> 03:45:21.620
<v Speaker 4>beyond the rhine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flags,</v>

3706
03:45:21.621 --> 03:45:26.621
<v Speaker 4>fluttering bands playing here was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>apotheosis dreamed of not only by our </v>

3707
03:45:26.621 --> 03:45:28.010
<v Speaker 4>great warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but by the government,</v>

3708
03:45:28.100 --> 03:45:30.040
<v Speaker 4>almost all the press,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost all</v>

3709
03:45:30.040 --> 03:45:31.630
<v Speaker 1>the Embas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gays and back in the rear.</v>

3710
03:45:31.631 --> 03:45:36.631
<v Speaker 1>All those who had nothing more to lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>or who had more to gain by continuing </v>

3711
03:45:36.631 --> 03:45:37.990
<v Speaker 1>the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did a 100,000,</v>

3712
03:45:38.110 --> 03:45:40.420
<v Speaker 1>200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>more cadavers matter,</v>

3713
03:45:40.510 --> 03:45:43.450
<v Speaker 1>a few more months of unimaginable </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering to bear.</v>

3714
03:45:44.350 --> 03:45:47.440
<v Speaker 1>Did that matter for those who were far </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the slug fest,</v>

3715
03:45:48.310 --> 03:45:50.590
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to accomplish this monstrous dream,</v>

3716
03:45:50.591 --> 03:45:55.591
<v Speaker 1>the so called allied government sought </v>
<v Speaker 1>to delay for as long as possible the </v>

3717
03:45:55.591 --> 03:45:59.881
<v Speaker 1>hour of the last cannon shot by </v>
<v Speaker 1>requiring Germany to repeat its demands </v>

3718
03:45:59.881 --> 03:46:03.460
<v Speaker 1>for our Mr several times for simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions of form and formulas.</v>

3719
03:46:04.060 --> 03:46:07.030
<v Speaker 1>He says during that time in an orgy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>murder,</v>

3720
03:46:07.031 --> 03:46:12.031
<v Speaker 1>bloodletting and burning the whole front</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in flames from eap to bell for </v>

3721
03:46:12.031 --> 03:46:16.081
<v Speaker 1>without exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the regimens were thrown into the </v>

3722
03:46:16.081 --> 03:46:17.310
<v Speaker 1>assault on the German machine guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

3723
03:46:17.311 --> 03:46:22.311
<v Speaker 1>the German army's been back on all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>points of contact without letting their </v>

3724
03:46:22.311 --> 03:46:25.170
<v Speaker 1>line be broken and their retreat didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn into a rout and quote</v>

3725
03:46:26.790 --> 03:46:31.790
<v Speaker 1>what you hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is admiration from a soldier to a </v>

3726
03:46:31.790 --> 03:46:35.721
<v Speaker 1>soldier and sort of a shared </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding that when it came right </v>

3727
03:46:35.721 --> 03:46:38.910
<v Speaker 1>down to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know truces could be called and they</v>

3728
03:46:38.911 --> 03:46:42.660
<v Speaker 1>could go in the middle of no man's land </v>
<v Speaker 1>and share tobacco in chocolate with each</v>

3729
03:46:42.661 --> 03:46:47.661
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people that has bartos had said </v>

3730
03:46:47.661 --> 03:46:50.640
<v Speaker 1>earlier in the work force them to fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other against their will,</v>

3731
03:46:51.020 --> 03:46:55.470
<v Speaker 1>would continue the conflict until things</v>
<v Speaker 1>were just the way they wanted and people</v>

3732
03:46:55.471 --> 03:47:00.471
<v Speaker 1>will die until the absolute last minute </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this conflict.</v>

3733
03:47:01.231 --> 03:47:03.870
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will die for decades afterwards.</v>

3734
03:47:05.100 --> 03:47:10.100
<v Speaker 1>The Germans will finally work out a deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Woodrow Wilson and the allies and </v>

3735
03:47:10.100 --> 03:47:14.271
<v Speaker 1>the entente.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to get rid of their form of </v>

3736
03:47:14.271 --> 03:47:14.850
<v Speaker 1>government and transitioned to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>republic Ludin.</v>

3737
03:47:14.851 --> 03:47:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Dorf offers his resignation at the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of days of October.</v>

3738
03:47:19.711 --> 03:47:24.711
<v Speaker 1>It's accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He dons a disguise and flees the </v>

3739
03:47:24.711 --> 03:47:24.711
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

3740
03:47:24.711 --> 03:47:29.090
<v Speaker 1>The Kaiser is told that he has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>abdicate to save lives in the end,</v>

3741
03:47:29.131 --> 03:47:30.780
<v Speaker 1>the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he tries not to,</v>

3742
03:47:31.440 --> 03:47:36.440
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of he says stabbed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back too and kind of forced to and and </v>

3743
03:47:36.440 --> 03:47:37.920
<v Speaker 1>he flees to the Netherlands and now this</v>
<v Speaker 1>new German government,</v>

3744
03:47:37.921 --> 03:47:42.921
<v Speaker 1>which has been sort of left behind as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>land mine by guys like Ludendorff </v>

3745
03:47:43.310 --> 03:47:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Ludendorff famously said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

3746
03:47:44.911 --> 03:47:47.100
<v Speaker 1>blaming the socialist and the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>back home.</v>

3747
03:47:47.220 --> 03:47:49.560
<v Speaker 1>You know that they did this stab in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

3748
03:47:49.561 --> 03:47:54.561
<v Speaker 1>So let them pick up the pieces and let </v>
<v Speaker 1>them get blamed by signing all the </v>

3749
03:47:54.561 --> 03:47:58.131
<v Speaker 1>surrender and our Mr papers and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of the way Ludina started spinning </v>

3750
03:47:58.131 --> 03:48:02.841
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing from minute one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler picked up on that and entire </v>

3751
03:48:02.841 --> 03:48:07.131
<v Speaker 1>German political movement will play off </v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that these people who signed </v>

3752
03:48:07.531 --> 03:48:10.380
<v Speaker 1>the peace agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the traders of November,</v>

3753
03:48:10.980 --> 03:48:15.980
<v Speaker 1>were the ones who lost the war and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was never lost at the front by the </v>

3754
03:48:15.980 --> 03:48:15.990
<v Speaker 1>soldiers.</v>

3755
03:48:16.290 --> 03:48:21.290
<v Speaker 1>This will set the stage for the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict and when the actual peace </v>

3756
03:48:22.141 --> 03:48:23.670
<v Speaker 1>agreement is signed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sealed,</v>

3757
03:48:23.671 --> 03:48:25.890
<v Speaker 1>and delivered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which won't happen for quite a while.</v>

3758
03:48:25.891 --> 03:48:27.890
<v Speaker 1>There'll be long negotiations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

3759
03:48:27.891 --> 03:48:32.891
<v Speaker 1>19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The results are so punitive that people </v>

3760
03:48:33.531 --> 03:48:38.531
<v Speaker 1>will realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward thinkers will realize and will </v>

3761
03:48:38.531 --> 03:48:41.081
<v Speaker 1>say at the time that this does nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>but delay the decision and that they </v>

3762
03:48:42.241 --> 03:48:47.241
<v Speaker 1>will be so many embittered elements </v>
<v Speaker 1>after this treaty assigned the one that </v>

3763
03:48:47.241 --> 03:48:49.610
<v Speaker 1>will actually end the first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be a series of treaties actually</v>

3764
03:48:50.120 --> 03:48:53.690
<v Speaker 1>that you're guaranteeing another world </v>
<v Speaker 1>war in the near future,</v>

3765
03:48:54.980 --> 03:48:59.120
<v Speaker 1>yet one can't help but think of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>men in uniform,</v>

3766
03:48:59.121 --> 03:49:04.121
<v Speaker 1>especially those in combat units at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>front who were just glad that they were </v>

3767
03:49:05.271 --> 03:49:10.271
<v Speaker 1>going to have a future and at the 11th </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour of the 11th Day of the 11th month,</v>

3768
03:49:14.360 --> 03:49:15.080
<v Speaker 1>11:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>AM,</v>

3769
03:49:15.081 --> 03:49:16.880
<v Speaker 1>November 11th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

3770
03:49:17.150 --> 03:49:22.150
<v Speaker 1>18 on many different fronts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers greeted this moment,</v>

3771
03:49:25.581 --> 03:49:26.810
<v Speaker 1>this agreed moment.</v>

3772
03:49:26.810 --> 03:49:29.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a little strange when the war would</v>
<v Speaker 1>end in advance.</v>

3773
03:49:31.460 --> 03:49:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Historian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldier and politician,</v>

3774
03:49:33.261 --> 03:49:35.630
<v Speaker 1>John Buchan was there at one part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>front.</v>

3775
03:49:35.810 --> 03:49:38.830
<v Speaker 1>The minute the war ended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what he wrote,</v>

3776
03:49:39.800 --> 03:49:44.800
<v Speaker 1>quote at two minutes to 11 opposite the </v>
<v Speaker 1>South African Brigade at the eastern </v>

3777
03:49:45.711 --> 03:49:47.840
<v Speaker 1>most point reached by the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>army's,</v>

3778
03:49:48.170 --> 03:49:52.340
<v Speaker 1>a German machine gunner after firing off</v>
<v Speaker 1>a belt without a pause,</v>

3779
03:49:52.580 --> 03:49:55.340
<v Speaker 1>was seeing to stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take off his helmet,</v>

3780
03:49:55.580 --> 03:49:58.430
<v Speaker 1>bow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then walk slowly to the rear.</v>

3781
03:49:58.700 --> 03:50:03.700
<v Speaker 1>There came a second of expect in silence</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then a curious rippling sound which </v>

3782
03:50:03.951 --> 03:50:08.180
<v Speaker 1>observers far behind the front likened </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the noise of a light wind.</v>

3783
03:50:08.720 --> 03:50:13.720
<v Speaker 1>It was the sound of men cheering from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the voltage to the sea and quote,</v>

3784
03:50:16.160 --> 03:50:21.160
<v Speaker 1>the future may have been poisoned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least these people would be there</v>

3785
03:50:21.261 --> 03:50:26.261
<v Speaker 1>to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>November 11th will be celebrated after </v>

3786
03:50:26.261 --> 03:50:31.181
<v Speaker 1>the war has armistice day and will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrated with a wide mix and range of </v>

3787
03:50:32.361 --> 03:50:35.480
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The war,</v>

3788
03:50:35.481 --> 03:50:39.470
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had taken the geo political chess map of</v>

3789
03:50:39.471 --> 03:50:44.471
<v Speaker 1>the world that had been basically in </v>
<v Speaker 1>place since Napoleon's defeat 100 years </v>

3790
03:50:44.471 --> 03:50:46.250
<v Speaker 1>before and throw it up in the air</v>

3791
03:50:48.100 --> 03:50:53.100
<v Speaker 1>and as the pieces fell back down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth and people tried to reconstruct a </v>

3792
03:50:54.221 --> 03:50:57.970
<v Speaker 1>new world really because countries had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been totally removed from the map.</v>

3793
03:50:58.810 --> 03:51:03.810
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people were going to suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason that the first world </v>

3794
03:51:03.810 --> 03:51:08.761
<v Speaker 1>war is so important to our modern time </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's a little like a giant </v>

3795
03:51:09.971 --> 03:51:12.670
<v Speaker 1>bundle of firecrackers that when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>light it off,</v>

3796
03:51:13.030 --> 03:51:18.030
<v Speaker 1>nice big chunks of firecrackers blow off</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the distance and continue to explode </v>

3797
03:51:18.030 --> 03:51:19.180
<v Speaker 1>sometimes with more violence than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>original.</v>

3798
03:51:19.181 --> 03:51:20.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what the Second World War </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

3799
03:51:20.831 --> 03:51:25.831
<v Speaker 1>right at direct successor Bolshevism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>which leads to the Cold War.</v>

3800
03:51:27.060 --> 03:51:32.060
<v Speaker 1>The situation in the Middle East and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil and the colonial impact.</v>

3801
03:51:33.660 --> 03:51:37.950
<v Speaker 1>The thing about the first world war is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it wasn't quite armageddon yet.</v>

3802
03:51:38.820 --> 03:51:43.820
<v Speaker 1>The very things that probably were </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to create an absolute global </v>

3803
03:51:44.041 --> 03:51:47.190
<v Speaker 1>holocaust hadn't yet entered into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

3804
03:51:47.191 --> 03:51:52.191
<v Speaker 1>Things like nuclear weapons for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you can safely say looking </v>

3805
03:51:52.191 --> 03:51:56.331
<v Speaker 1>at it that what the first world war was </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a blueprint for Armageddon.</v>

3806
03:52:04.690 --> 03:52:09.690
<v Speaker 1>If this were a book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this would sort of be the postscript </v>

3807
03:52:09.690 --> 03:52:12.480
<v Speaker 1>section I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the most interesting aspects </v>

3808
03:52:12.480 --> 03:52:15.820
<v Speaker 1>of the first world war is what came </v>
<v Speaker 1>right afterwards,</v>

3809
03:52:15.821 --> 03:52:18.430
<v Speaker 1>sort of as a result of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changed so much,</v>

3810
03:52:18.580 --> 03:52:20.950
<v Speaker 1>so the catalyst for change itself is </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

3811
03:52:21.160 --> 03:52:23.260
<v Speaker 1>but the change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it ushered in this fascinating</v>

3812
03:52:24.860 --> 03:52:28.760
<v Speaker 1>start with the fact that all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the map of Europe,</v>

3813
03:52:28.761 --> 03:52:31.940
<v Speaker 1>the Great Geo political chess board that</v>
<v Speaker 1>had existed forever,</v>

3814
03:52:31.941 --> 03:52:36.941
<v Speaker 1>was thrown up in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally scattered and all of a sudden </v>

3815
03:52:36.941 --> 03:52:38.200
<v Speaker 1>pieces fell down that hadn't existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3816
03:52:38.310 --> 03:52:39.460
<v Speaker 1>in a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden,</v>

3817
03:52:39.470 --> 03:52:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Poland was back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There hadn't been a Poland for quite </v>

3818
03:52:44.470 --> 03:52:46.931
<v Speaker 1>some time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden there was going to be </v>

3819
03:52:46.931 --> 03:52:46.931
<v Speaker 1>like a checklist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slovakia.</v>

3820
03:52:46.931 --> 03:52:48.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are places that used to be part of</v>

3821
03:52:48.471 --> 03:52:53.471
<v Speaker 1>larger empires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those empires were smashed by this </v>

3822
03:52:53.471 --> 03:52:53.471
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austria,</v>

3823
03:52:53.471 --> 03:52:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Hungary alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you break that up,</v>

3824
03:52:54.351 --> 03:52:59.351
<v Speaker 1>you get a bunch of new countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you break the Ottoman Empire up,</v>

3825
03:52:59.541 --> 03:53:01.250
<v Speaker 1>you get the modern Middle East,</v>

3826
03:53:02.970 --> 03:53:07.970
<v Speaker 1>you break Germany up and you get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments for the Second World War,</v>

3827
03:53:09.181 --> 03:53:14.181
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get dancing and you get the sudeten </v>

3828
03:53:14.181 --> 03:53:16.540
<v Speaker 1>land and what's also a parent at the end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the first world war is you get this </v>

3829
03:53:17.461 --> 03:53:22.260
<v Speaker 1>period of people who are trying to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>the game the way it's always been played</v>

3830
03:53:22.261 --> 03:53:23.850
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could make an argument,</v>

3831
03:53:23.851 --> 03:53:28.680
<v Speaker 1>always will be played,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people who are trying to utilize the</v>

3832
03:53:28.681 --> 03:53:30.990
<v Speaker 1>flip side of bitterness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you could say,</v>

3833
03:53:30.991 --> 03:53:35.991
<v Speaker 1>to create a better world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked earlier about Woodrow Wilson </v>

3834
03:53:35.991 --> 03:53:39.531
<v Speaker 1>and his idealism or fake idealism </v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on which woodrow Wilson you buy </v>

3835
03:53:39.531 --> 03:53:40.590
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless,</v>

3836
03:53:40.920 --> 03:53:45.660
<v Speaker 1>when you sell a war on the idea that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a war to end all wars,</v>

3837
03:53:46.140 --> 03:53:51.140
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that becomes powerful hype </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to at least make a good </v>

3838
03:53:51.140 --> 03:53:53.460
<v Speaker 1>argument around if you want to play </v>
<v Speaker 1>things the old fashioned way.</v>

3839
03:53:54.210 --> 03:53:55.740
<v Speaker 1>The British and the French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

3840
03:53:57.000 --> 03:54:02.000
<v Speaker 1>make out like winners in the war when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to the territory that they </v>

3841
03:54:03.331 --> 03:54:05.610
<v Speaker 1>acquired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When when the Ottoman Empire broke up,</v>

3842
03:54:05.790 --> 03:54:09.540
<v Speaker 1>all those new countries didn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>get full independence.</v>

3843
03:54:09.541 --> 03:54:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Most of them had a sort of a compromise </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty.</v>

3844
03:54:12.331 --> 03:54:16.620
<v Speaker 1>Is that a good way to put it with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French or the British Empire in charge,</v>

3845
03:54:17.760 --> 03:54:20.790
<v Speaker 1>that 20th century version of coal thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil.</v>

3846
03:54:21.270 --> 03:54:24.760
<v Speaker 1>The British will miraculously ended up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a ton of it,</v>

3847
03:54:26.400 --> 03:54:31.400
<v Speaker 1>but the Americans and others had pushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas like self determination and the </v>

3848
03:54:31.400 --> 03:54:33.030
<v Speaker 1>British had sorta mild that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they kind of believed it too.</v>

3849
03:54:33.031 --> 03:54:38.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things where as the </v>

3850
03:54:38.031 --> 03:54:40.730
<v Speaker 1>prime minister had said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he kind of would have been remiss if he </v>

3851
03:54:40.730 --> 03:54:40.980
<v Speaker 1>didn't grab some of that area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just let the French habit.</v>

3852
03:54:41.010 --> 03:54:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all kind of realized it didn't look</v>

3853
03:54:43.231 --> 03:54:45.210
<v Speaker 1>that great with a new set of values in </v>
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>

3854
03:54:45.510 --> 03:54:50.510
<v Speaker 1>but self-determination became this weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to know who deserves their own </v>

3855
03:54:50.551 --> 03:54:54.090
<v Speaker 1>place and and how can you use self </v>
<v Speaker 1>determination as a weapon.</v>

3856
03:54:54.091 --> 03:54:59.091
<v Speaker 1>Hitler would use it against one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>territories that was created out of </v>

3857
03:54:59.091 --> 03:55:01.290
<v Speaker 1>whole cloth by the World War One peace </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreements place called checklist.</v>

3858
03:55:01.291 --> 03:55:06.291
<v Speaker 1>Slovakia within that place was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory that had a majority of </v>

3859
03:55:06.291 --> 03:55:10.311
<v Speaker 1>Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was called the sudeten land and </v>

3860
03:55:10.311 --> 03:55:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Hitler would turn the arguments of </v>
<v Speaker 1>idealism and self determination on their</v>

3861
03:55:13.321 --> 03:55:14.190
<v Speaker 1>head when you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3862
03:55:14.191 --> 03:55:16.200
<v Speaker 1>if self determination is what you really</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in,</v>

3863
03:55:16.380 --> 03:55:21.380
<v Speaker 1>those Germans in the sudeten land should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be allowed to come back to Germany and </v>

3864
03:55:21.380 --> 03:55:21.480
<v Speaker 1>bring their land with them.</v>

3865
03:55:23.030 --> 03:55:26.450
<v Speaker 1>This would turn out to be a big problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what are called the interwar years.</v>

3866
03:55:26.690 --> 03:55:31.100
<v Speaker 1>It would hamstring an entity that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>truly idealistic,</v>

3867
03:55:31.160 --> 03:55:36.160
<v Speaker 1>like the League of nations setup after </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first world war by the people who </v>

3868
03:55:36.160 --> 03:55:37.610
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said on the flip side,</v>

3869
03:55:37.611 --> 03:55:41.270
<v Speaker 1>sort of have the global bipolar mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of being bitter.</v>

3870
03:55:41.450 --> 03:55:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Their attitude about the first world war</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a sort of a never again,</v>

3871
03:55:45.260 --> 03:55:49.820
<v Speaker 1>out of food and things like the League </v>
<v Speaker 1>of nations and collective security.</v>

3872
03:55:50.000 --> 03:55:55.000
<v Speaker 1>We're going to ensure that the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>never had a tragedy like that happen </v>

3873
03:55:55.000 --> 03:55:58.571
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We emphasize the bitterness at the end </v>

3874
03:55:58.571 --> 03:56:00.200
<v Speaker 1>of the last program because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitterness helps play into the next war,</v>

3875
03:56:00.530 --> 03:56:05.530
<v Speaker 1>but there were a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't bitter and it's only fair to </v>

3876
03:56:05.530 --> 03:56:05.530
<v Speaker 1>point that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

3877
03:56:05.530 --> 03:56:07.460
<v Speaker 1>you had people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times these were officers too.</v>

3878
03:56:07.461 --> 03:56:12.461
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting to note who were so </v>
<v Speaker 1>proud of their war service and what </v>

3879
03:56:12.461 --> 03:56:13.220
<v Speaker 1>happened and and justifiably so.</v>

3880
03:56:13.220 --> 03:56:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Look what these people endured wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>take anything away from anyone.</v>

3881
03:56:17.450 --> 03:56:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Some people straight up enjoy the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

3882
03:56:20.810 --> 03:56:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Ernst Junger has a piece in his book </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he does something that I think </v>

3883
03:56:25.810 --> 03:56:28.670
<v Speaker 1>many people throughout history have done</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're at giant historical events.</v>

3884
03:56:28.671 --> 03:56:33.350
<v Speaker 1>When you're at a great battle and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know you're watching history unfold,</v>

3885
03:56:33.530 --> 03:56:38.530
<v Speaker 1>sometimes there's a powerful feeling in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and especially when you think </v>

3886
03:56:38.530 --> 03:56:42.611
<v Speaker 1>you're playing a part in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the 50th anniversary of the Normandy </v>

3887
03:56:42.611 --> 03:56:42.800
<v Speaker 1>landings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a d day,</v>

3888
03:56:42.801 --> 03:56:47.801
<v Speaker 1>I remember there was a newspaper article</v>
<v Speaker 1>published by an army psychiatrist who </v>

3889
03:56:48.351 --> 03:56:53.351
<v Speaker 1>was talking about these kinds of moments</v>
<v Speaker 1>in soldiers' lives and said that for </v>

3890
03:56:53.351 --> 03:56:58.010
<v Speaker 1>many of the men you know who were at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know de day in the Second World War,</v>

3891
03:56:58.250 --> 03:57:00.260
<v Speaker 1>that was the greatest experience of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives.</v>

3892
03:57:00.261 --> 03:57:05.261
<v Speaker 1>The greatest event they would take part </v>
<v Speaker 1>in historian Neil Ferguson.</v>

3893
03:57:05.411 --> 03:57:10.411
<v Speaker 1>In his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pity of war describes the </v>

3894
03:57:10.411 --> 03:57:13.951
<v Speaker 1>remembrances of a couple of soldiers who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were probably representative of a whole </v>

3895
03:57:13.951 --> 03:57:17.260
<v Speaker 1>lot of these soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one's a Canadian private talking about,</v>

3896
03:57:17.660 --> 03:57:19.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the first world war was to him,</v>

3897
03:57:19.511 --> 03:57:22.910
<v Speaker 1>and he said it was quote the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure of my life,</v>

3898
03:57:23.150 --> 03:57:28.150
<v Speaker 1>the memories of which will remain with </v>
<v Speaker 1>me for the remainder of my days and I </v>

3899
03:57:28.150 --> 03:57:29.690
<v Speaker 1>would not have missed it for anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>and quote.</v>

3900
03:57:30.900 --> 03:57:35.900
<v Speaker 1>It also had this sort of momentous </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling that was sometimes tough to in a</v>

3901
03:57:37.111 --> 03:57:42.111
<v Speaker 1>recapture and private life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ferguson also quoted another soldier </v>

3902
03:57:42.111 --> 03:57:42.480
<v Speaker 1>that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

3903
03:57:43.110 --> 03:57:47.840
<v Speaker 1>everything that happened after the war </v>
<v Speaker 1>was an anticlimax and to quote,</v>

3904
03:57:49.000 --> 03:57:51.880
<v Speaker 1>in some ways the war was enhance </v>
<v Speaker 1>anticlimax.</v>

3905
03:57:53.290 --> 03:57:58.290
<v Speaker 1>So many people went to fight based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas like the war to end all wars and </v>

3906
03:57:59.561 --> 03:58:04.561
<v Speaker 1>yet people who were rather far sighted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there were plenty of them before the</v>

3907
03:58:04.931 --> 03:58:08.410
<v Speaker 1>smoke had even cleared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're predicting the second world war.</v>

3908
03:58:08.411 --> 03:58:11.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean the general release Cmo of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>allied on ton forces.</v>

3909
03:58:11.621 --> 03:58:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Ferdinand foshe had said when he saw the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Versailles peace treaty,</v>

3910
03:58:16.121 --> 03:58:21.121
<v Speaker 1>this is not peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a 20 year armistice and by the </v>

3911
03:58:21.121 --> 03:58:25.111
<v Speaker 1>way was almost 20 years exactly 21.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked to the British and the French </v>

3912
03:58:26.501 --> 03:58:29.920
<v Speaker 1>like they made out well with territories</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were able to take over,</v>

3913
03:58:30.520 --> 03:58:35.520
<v Speaker 1>but they were both in terms of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>great power status,</v>

3914
03:58:36.220 --> 03:58:40.970
<v Speaker 1>mortally wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The eventual cost of this war especially</v>

3915
03:58:40.971 --> 03:58:43.100
<v Speaker 1>falls on Britain's shoulders more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>any others.</v>

3916
03:58:43.101 --> 03:58:48.101
<v Speaker 1>They were sort of the banker of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>allied side and they are still are or </v>

3917
03:58:48.101 --> 03:58:52.991
<v Speaker 1>were recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if there are still </v>

3918
03:58:52.991 --> 03:58:54.401
<v Speaker 1>outstanding loans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was only in the last few months </v>

3919
03:58:54.401 --> 03:58:57.310
<v Speaker 1>that they paid off one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outstanding first world war debts that </v>

3920
03:58:57.310 --> 03:58:57.310
<v Speaker 1>were still out there</v>

3921
03:58:57.480 --> 03:59:02.480
<v Speaker 1>as we had said in the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the center of World Trade and </v>

3922
03:59:02.480 --> 03:59:05.781
<v Speaker 1>banking transferred from London to New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York during this conflict and as a </v>

3923
03:59:06.061 --> 03:59:11.061
<v Speaker 1>result of the financial transfer of </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth from the old world to the new </v>

3924
03:59:11.061 --> 03:59:15.111
<v Speaker 1>world that this conflict required as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>had said about token.</v>

3925
03:59:15.451 --> 03:59:17.370
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>

3926
03:59:17.930 --> 03:59:22.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peoples of the free peoples of middle </v>

3927
03:59:22.930 --> 03:59:23.700
<v Speaker 1>earth destroying themselves to take down</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark Lord.</v>

3928
03:59:23.701 --> 03:59:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's gone.</v>

3929
03:59:25.110 --> 03:59:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Imperial Germany's no threat to anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

3930
03:59:28.290 --> 03:59:33.290
<v Speaker 1>but France and Britain to name just two </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries or me not even to go into </v>

3931
03:59:33.290 --> 03:59:37.611
<v Speaker 1>Russia's backyard and mentioned them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>France and Britain will never quite be </v>

3932
03:59:37.611 --> 03:59:39.950
<v Speaker 1>what they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians.</v>

3933
03:59:39.951 --> 03:59:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Needless to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm aren't going to be what they are.</v>

3934
03:59:42.681 --> 03:59:47.681
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be living under a </v>
<v Speaker 1>communist regime for decades.</v>

3935
03:59:48.140 --> 03:59:53.140
<v Speaker 1>The Tsar and his family in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>1918 will be executed by the Bolsheviks.</v>

3936
03:59:54.711 --> 03:59:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Every last one of them and the cook,</v>

3937
03:59:58.280 --> 04:00:02.810
<v Speaker 1>the United States comes out of the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well actually they're,</v>

3938
04:00:02.811 --> 04:00:06.800
<v Speaker 1>they're on the receiving end of all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>old world wealth for example,</v>

3939
04:00:07.670 --> 04:00:12.670
<v Speaker 1>but for Americans it was quite a change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a change that had really started with </v>

3940
04:00:12.670 --> 04:00:14.180
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish American war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3941
04:00:14.181 --> 04:00:17.840
<v Speaker 1>20 or so years before the first world </v>
<v Speaker 1>war when the United States started going</v>

3942
04:00:17.841 --> 04:00:21.120
<v Speaker 1>abroad and involving themselves more </v>
<v Speaker 1>overseas.</v>

3943
04:00:21.121 --> 04:00:26.121
<v Speaker 1>The first world war solidified that </v>
<v Speaker 1>trend and even though after the war </v>

3944
04:00:26.121 --> 04:00:26.720
<v Speaker 1>there would be this mood that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3945
04:00:26.780 --> 04:00:29.640
<v Speaker 1>we're not doing that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could tell that it's.</v>

3946
04:00:29.940 --> 04:00:34.940
<v Speaker 1>It was sort of like virginity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a barrier had been crossed and you </v>

3947
04:00:34.940 --> 04:00:36.810
<v Speaker 1>really just couldn't go back to the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>things were.</v>

3948
04:00:36.811 --> 04:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>We'd find that out as Americans in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Second World War.</v>

3949
04:00:41.870 --> 04:00:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Americans also got to experience other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that would not be uncommon in </v>

3950
04:00:46.870 --> 04:00:50.831
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things like sedition and espionage acts </v>

3951
04:00:50.831 --> 04:00:53.600
<v Speaker 1>imposed by the Wilson Administration </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to prevent criticism of the war,</v>

3952
04:00:53.780 --> 04:00:58.780
<v Speaker 1>antiwar activities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminalized laws that are still on the </v>

3953
04:00:58.780 --> 04:01:02.681
<v Speaker 1>books and still used today that most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people look back on and still think that</v>

3954
04:01:02.871 --> 04:01:05.960
<v Speaker 1>those were extreme overreaches of </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential authority.</v>

3955
04:01:06.650 --> 04:01:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3956
04:01:08.181 --> 04:01:10.550
<v Speaker 1>it was the first world war and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>threat was there.</v>

3957
04:01:12.910 --> 04:01:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

3958
04:01:14.651 --> 04:01:19.651
<v Speaker 1>it would be the United States or Japan </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I would nominate for the big </v>

3959
04:01:19.651 --> 04:01:20.170
<v Speaker 1>victories in these wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan had a relatively easy run of.</v>

3960
04:01:20.171 --> 04:01:23.650
<v Speaker 1>It took over anything that was over in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their territory that was German and then</v>

3961
04:01:23.651 --> 04:01:28.651
<v Speaker 1>started moving in more to the Asian </v>
<v Speaker 1>mainland already in charge of a lot of </v>

3962
04:01:28.651 --> 04:01:33.241
<v Speaker 1>Korean folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started taking over territory that </v>

3963
04:01:33.241 --> 04:01:36.091
<v Speaker 1>would eventually morphed into what some </v>
<v Speaker 1>historians now considered to be the </v>

3964
04:01:36.091 --> 04:01:37.870
<v Speaker 1>really early stages of the Second World </v>
<v Speaker 1>War.</v>

3965
04:01:38.500 --> 04:01:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Because by the time the second world war</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks out,</v>

3966
04:01:41.831 --> 04:01:46.831
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese had been involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting with the Chinese for years and </v>

3967
04:01:46.831 --> 04:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>some fighting with the Russians to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey will continue to have problems </v>

3968
04:01:50.550 --> 04:01:53.740
<v Speaker 1>with violence and ethnic conflict and </v>
<v Speaker 1>modernism.</v>

3969
04:01:54.790 --> 04:01:56.660
<v Speaker 1>The fighting will never really stop over</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3970
04:01:56.680 --> 04:02:01.570
<v Speaker 1>in Anatolia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that country will continue to strive</v>

3971
04:02:01.600 --> 04:02:05.590
<v Speaker 1>towards a more a national state hood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll go through a period,</v>

3972
04:02:05.920 --> 04:02:07.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under Kemal Ataturk,</v>

3973
04:02:07.571 --> 04:02:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Mustafa Kemal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3974
04:02:09.100 --> 04:02:10.780
<v Speaker 1>that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And their history.</v>

3975
04:02:11.170 --> 04:02:16.170
<v Speaker 1>They'll also have to begin to live down </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the things that were done during</v>

3976
04:02:17.501 --> 04:02:20.380
<v Speaker 1>the first world war and famously to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Armenians,</v>

3977
04:02:20.381 --> 04:02:23.380
<v Speaker 1>but also to people like a Syrian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christians,</v>

3978
04:02:23.620 --> 04:02:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Greeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Turks had an ethnic problem that </v>

3979
04:02:28.620 --> 04:02:31.000
<v Speaker 1>they dealt with sometimes in a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy handed manner.</v>

3980
04:02:31.810 --> 04:02:35.410
<v Speaker 1>The Austro-hungarian is also had an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic problem.</v>

3981
04:02:35.920 --> 04:02:40.920
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with the Habsburg rulers that had </v>

3982
04:02:40.920 --> 04:02:42.580
<v Speaker 1>been in power for centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were wiped away as a result of this war.</v>

3983
04:02:44.130 --> 04:02:49.130
<v Speaker 1>And the idea of self determination that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hitler would be able to use about the </v>

3984
04:02:49.130 --> 04:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>sudeten land and whatnot would begin to </v>
<v Speaker 1>raise ugly sort of questions in places </v>

3985
04:02:54.901 --> 04:02:59.901
<v Speaker 1>like India controlled by the British.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not necessarily because the Indians </v>

3986
04:03:00.031 --> 04:03:05.031
<v Speaker 1>wanted it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to clean up after the war is one </v>

3987
04:03:07.981 --> 04:03:12.981
<v Speaker 1>of the great efforts of modern times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First you have the bodies to deal with,</v>

3988
04:03:14.900 --> 04:03:19.900
<v Speaker 1>then you have the damage to the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the cleanup that </v>

3989
04:03:19.900 --> 04:03:21.460
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3990
04:03:21.461 --> 04:03:26.461
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the collective populations of all </v>

3991
04:03:26.461 --> 04:03:26.860
<v Speaker 1>these countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emotional cleanup,</v>

3992
04:03:26.861 --> 04:03:28.610
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the getting past it.</v>

3993
04:03:29.890 --> 04:03:34.890
<v Speaker 1>All of these societies that were heavily</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in the first world war will </v>

3994
04:03:34.890 --> 04:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of disabled veterans around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will be a very visible reminder.</v>

3995
04:03:38.770 --> 04:03:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gets to just put this behind them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and walk away unscathed.</v>

3996
04:03:45.600 --> 04:03:50.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam hochschild in his book relates that</v>

3997
04:03:50.161 --> 04:03:53.040
<v Speaker 1>dates from the time of these last German</v>
<v Speaker 1>offensive,</v>

3998
04:03:53.041 --> 04:03:55.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big last card being played.</v>

3999
04:03:55.530 --> 04:04:00.530
<v Speaker 1>That is a perfect example of what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in hundreds of thousands of </v>

4000
04:04:01.891 --> 04:04:02.550
<v Speaker 1>homes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4001
04:04:02.551 --> 04:04:03.750
<v Speaker 1>there's no question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was that many.</v>

4002
04:04:03.751 --> 04:04:05.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm just playing that number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Safe</v>

4003
04:04:06.700 --> 04:04:11.700
<v Speaker 1>harsh child talks about these cards that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the officers would send to family </v>

4004
04:04:11.700 --> 04:04:16.030
<v Speaker 1>members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>informing them that their child or loved</v>

4005
04:04:16.031 --> 04:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>one was dead or missing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

4006
04:04:18.701 --> 04:04:19.060
<v Speaker 1>quote</v>

4007
04:04:19.900 --> 04:04:24.900
<v Speaker 4>cards float out in a ceaseless stream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when it came to Stephen Hog houses,</v>

4008
04:04:25.091 --> 04:04:26.980
<v Speaker 4>younger brother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his parents,</v>

4009
04:04:27.100 --> 04:04:32.100
<v Speaker 4>like so many others,</v>
<v Speaker 4>simply received word that in the new </v>

4010
04:04:32.100 --> 04:04:33.710
<v Speaker 4>German offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 23 year old Paul was quote,</v>

4011
04:04:33.940 --> 04:04:36.580
<v Speaker 4>missing presumed killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>End Quote.</v>

4012
04:04:37.240 --> 04:04:42.240
<v Speaker 4>He had been seen fighting than falling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When his units position was overrun </v>

4013
04:04:42.240 --> 04:04:46.950
<v Speaker 4>several months later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the family's hopes were raised when a </v>

4014
04:04:46.950 --> 04:04:49.621
<v Speaker 4>fellow officer passed on a rumor that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Paul was wounded and a prisoner in </v>

4015
04:04:49.621 --> 04:04:52.240
<v Speaker 4>Germany with male going through contacts</v>
<v Speaker 4>in neutral countries.</v>

4016
04:04:52.360 --> 04:04:55.120
<v Speaker 4>Steven got in touch with a passivist </v>
<v Speaker 4>committee in Berlin.</v>

4017
04:04:55.320 --> 04:05:00.320
<v Speaker 4>Quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was very glad to be able to set on </v>

4018
04:05:00.320 --> 04:05:01.030
<v Speaker 4>foot by this means in search for my </v>
<v Speaker 4>brother Paul,</v>

4019
04:05:01.150 --> 04:05:03.610
<v Speaker 4>alas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No trace of him could be found.</v>

4020
04:05:03.820 --> 04:05:08.820
<v Speaker 4>My poor mother for over six months </v>
<v Speaker 4>persisted in the Fonda belief that Paul </v>

4021
04:05:08.820 --> 04:05:11.860
<v Speaker 4>would return and quote hochschild </v>
<v Speaker 4>continues.</v>

4022
04:05:12.160 --> 04:05:17.160
<v Speaker 4>During that time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Margaret hobhouse never ceased to write </v>

4023
04:05:17.160 --> 04:05:18.010
<v Speaker 4>letters to her son,</v>
<v Speaker 4>although they eventually came back,</v>

4024
04:05:18.011 --> 04:05:21.340
<v Speaker 4>marked undeliverable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>returned to sender.</v>

4025
04:05:21.840 --> 04:05:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Paul's body was never found and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

4026
04:05:27.770 --> 04:05:32.000
<v Speaker 1>but lots and lots of other peoples were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're still being found.</v>

4027
04:05:33.470 --> 04:05:38.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how much of the really </v>

4028
04:05:38.470 --> 04:05:42.551
<v Speaker 1>nasty stuff to get into on a program </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this because you don't want to be </v>

4029
04:05:42.551 --> 04:05:45.140
<v Speaker 1>gratuitous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you do want to be able to do is</v>

4030
04:05:45.141 --> 04:05:48.710
<v Speaker 1>in your mind's eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what these people are seeing,</v>

4031
04:05:48.711 --> 04:05:49.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we always say,</v>

4032
04:05:49.701 --> 04:05:52.010
<v Speaker 1>you can't experience or understand what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going through,</v>

4033
04:05:52.011 --> 04:05:56.480
<v Speaker 1>but you can try to have the tiniest </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit of emotional sympathy,</v>

4034
04:05:56.840 --> 04:06:01.840
<v Speaker 1>but you kind of have to see things </v>
<v Speaker 1>through their eyes and what they're </v>

4035
04:06:01.840 --> 04:06:04.661
<v Speaker 1>seeing is permanently scarring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who have to clean up after </v>

4036
04:06:04.671 --> 04:06:08.720
<v Speaker 1>this war are sometimes as traumatized as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that have to fight it.</v>

4037
04:06:09.800 --> 04:06:14.690
<v Speaker 1>After these last big German offensives </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that last story dealt with,</v>

4038
04:06:15.350 --> 04:06:16.100
<v Speaker 1>the boy missing</v>

4039
04:06:16.100 --> 04:06:21.100
<v Speaker 4>and presumed killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people who were killed had to be </v>

4040
04:06:21.100 --> 04:06:24.170
<v Speaker 4>picked up by somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>An American soldier named Robert Hoffman</v>

4041
04:06:24.500 --> 04:06:29.500
<v Speaker 4>in August 19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>18 was one of those somebody one day he </v>

4042
04:06:29.500 --> 04:06:32.660
<v Speaker 4>writes quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you ever smell a dead mouse?</v>

4043
04:06:32.990 --> 04:06:37.990
<v Speaker 4>That will give you about as much idea of</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a group of long dead soldiers </v>

4044
04:06:37.990 --> 04:06:41.981
<v Speaker 4>smells like as will one grain of sand </v>
<v Speaker 4>give you an idea of Atlantic city's </v>

4045
04:06:41.981 --> 04:06:44.780
<v Speaker 4>beaches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A group of men were sent to hill two,</v>

4046
04:06:44.781 --> 04:06:45.230
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four,</v>

4047
04:06:45.231 --> 04:06:50.231
<v Speaker 4>to make a reconnaissance to report on </v>
<v Speaker 4>conditions there as well as to bury the </v>

4048
04:06:50.231 --> 04:06:52.010
<v Speaker 4>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The story was a very pathetic one.</v>

4049
04:06:52.011 --> 04:06:55.430
<v Speaker 4>He says the men were still lying there </v>
<v Speaker 4>nearly two weeks later,</v>

4050
04:06:55.431 --> 04:07:00.431
<v Speaker 4>just as they'd fallen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I knew all of these men intimately and </v>

4051
04:07:00.431 --> 04:07:01.640
<v Speaker 4>it was indeed painful to learn of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>condition.</v>

4052
04:07:01.850 --> 04:07:06.850
<v Speaker 4>Some had apparently lived for some time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had tried to dress their own wounds or </v>

4053
04:07:06.850 --> 04:07:08.720
<v Speaker 4>their comrades addressed them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but later they died.</v>

4054
04:07:08.720 --> 04:07:13.720
<v Speaker 4>There I was especially pleased that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>capture of the German soldiers had made </v>

4055
04:07:13.720 --> 04:07:15.650
<v Speaker 4>it possible to bring back all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wounded in our sector.</v>

4056
04:07:15.890 --> 04:07:20.890
<v Speaker 4>Many of the men had been pumped full of </v>
<v Speaker 4>machine gun bullets shot almost beyond </v>

4057
04:07:20.890 --> 04:07:22.130
<v Speaker 4>recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred or so bullets,</v>

4058
04:07:22.310 --> 04:07:24.800
<v Speaker 4>even in a dead man's body is not a </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty sight.</v>

4059
04:07:25.190 --> 04:07:27.830
<v Speaker 4>One of our men was lying with a German </v>
<v Speaker 4>bayonet through him.</v>

4060
04:07:28.040 --> 04:07:33.040
<v Speaker 4>Not unlike a pin through a large beetle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bayonets are hard to remove when once </v>

4061
04:07:33.040 --> 04:07:35.640
<v Speaker 4>they've been caught between the ribs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially the Sawtooth Bay,</v>

4062
04:07:35.641 --> 04:07:38.510
<v Speaker 4>and that's many of the Germans carried </v>
<v Speaker 4>to dislodge them.</v>

4063
04:07:38.511 --> 04:07:41.660
<v Speaker 4>It's usually necessary to shoot once or </v>
<v Speaker 4>more to loosen the bay and net.</v>

4064
04:07:42.020 --> 04:07:45.230
<v Speaker 4>This German had not waited,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but left his gun and passed on.</v>

4065
04:07:45.560 --> 04:07:48.290
<v Speaker 4>The little Italian boy was lying on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>barbed wire.</v>

4066
04:07:48.470 --> 04:07:51.140
<v Speaker 4>His eyes open and his helmet hanging </v>
<v Speaker 4>back on his head.</v>

4067
04:07:51.560 --> 04:07:56.560
<v Speaker 4>There had been so much shrapnel that </v>
<v Speaker 4>some of the bodies were torn beyond </v>

4068
04:07:56.560 --> 04:07:59.351
<v Speaker 4>recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was the first experience at </v>

4069
04:07:59.351 --> 04:08:00.050
<v Speaker 4>handling and burying the dead for many </v>
<v Speaker 4>of our men.</v>

4070
04:08:00.350 --> 04:08:03.980
<v Speaker 4>It was a trying experience as I was to </v>
<v Speaker 4>personally find somewhat later.</v>

4071
04:08:05.390 --> 04:08:10.390
<v Speaker 4>He then goes on to say there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 4>more pitiful than a battlefield after a </v>

4072
04:08:10.390 --> 04:08:10.390
<v Speaker 4>battle.</v>

4073
04:08:12.140 --> 04:08:12.860
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pitiful.</v>

4074
04:08:12.861 --> 04:08:13.460
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

4075
04:08:14.900 --> 04:08:19.760
<v Speaker 4>but dangerous is another term we might </v>
<v Speaker 4>use because this cleanup is ongoing.</v>

4076
04:08:19.761 --> 04:08:24.761
<v Speaker 4>Even now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a good side and a downside for </v>

4077
04:08:24.761 --> 04:08:26.930
<v Speaker 4>the cleanup process with having a war </v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't move.</v>

4078
04:08:27.590 --> 04:08:31.460
<v Speaker 4>The great mass of Europe and places </v>
<v Speaker 4>elsewhere were spared.</v>

4079
04:08:31.940 --> 04:08:36.940
<v Speaker 4>The total sort of ruiness war that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>second world war brought to so many </v>

4080
04:08:36.940 --> 04:08:40.661
<v Speaker 4>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the places where the war was </v>

4081
04:08:40.661 --> 04:08:40.940
<v Speaker 4>actually fought were devastated and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>just devastated,</v>

4082
04:08:40.941 --> 04:08:43.700
<v Speaker 4>permanently scarred,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe permanently ruined.</v>

4083
04:08:44.060 --> 04:08:47.240
<v Speaker 4>Certainly for several foreseeable </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifetimes.</v>

4084
04:08:47.390 --> 04:08:52.390
<v Speaker 4>Author Donovan Webster wrote a whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>book on the state of those battlefields </v>

4085
04:08:52.491 --> 04:08:55.790
<v Speaker 4>in earlier wars today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the most polluted,</v>

4086
04:08:56.180 --> 04:09:01.180
<v Speaker 4>most dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most impossible to imagine them ever </v>

4087
04:09:01.180 --> 04:09:04.961
<v Speaker 4>cleaning up are all these ones that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first world war fought on the western </v>

4088
04:09:04.961 --> 04:09:08.060
<v Speaker 4>front in these places where things </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't move for years because the shells</v>

4089
04:09:08.090 --> 04:09:13.090
<v Speaker 4>buried themselves in the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what the exact </v>

4090
04:09:13.090 --> 04:09:14.160
<v Speaker 4>percentage that they that they estimated</v>

4091
04:09:14.280 --> 04:09:17.490
<v Speaker 1>the number of duds versus the number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>good shells were,</v>

4092
04:09:18.060 --> 04:09:23.060
<v Speaker 1>but since 1946 French specialists have </v>
<v Speaker 1>removed 18 million shells and they </v>

4093
04:09:27.661 --> 04:09:32.400
<v Speaker 1>estimate that there's another 12 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>just around Verdun.</v>

4094
04:09:33.840 --> 04:09:36.840
<v Speaker 1>The biggest shells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those Paris gun shells,</v>

4095
04:09:36.841 --> 04:09:39.750
<v Speaker 1>the duds from those are so deep in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth,</v>

4096
04:09:39.780 --> 04:09:43.320
<v Speaker 1>they won't even make their way to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface for 60 years.</v>

4097
04:09:45.580 --> 04:09:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds and hundreds of these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who go and try to clean up these areas </v>

4098
04:09:50.580 --> 04:09:52.000
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There've been farmers killed,</v>

4099
04:09:52.001 --> 04:09:57.001
<v Speaker 1>there were like 35 killed in one year </v>
<v Speaker 1>when their tractors were hitting shells </v>

4100
04:09:57.001 --> 04:09:57.880
<v Speaker 1>and some of these shells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you might imagine,</v>

4101
04:09:58.300 --> 04:10:03.300
<v Speaker 1>are chemical weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problems that these people have </v>

4102
04:10:03.300 --> 04:10:07.171
<v Speaker 1>trying to reclaim the areas are so bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they just have cordoned off the </v>

4103
04:10:07.171 --> 04:10:10.351
<v Speaker 1>area since the war and millions upon </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of acres of France and part of </v>

4104
04:10:10.571 --> 04:10:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Belgium are just shut down too </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>

4105
04:10:13.630 --> 04:10:18.630
<v Speaker 1>so it's like the world's biggest garbage</v>
<v Speaker 1>dump with human beings all ground up </v>

4106
04:10:18.630 --> 04:10:23.011
<v Speaker 1>through it and then it's littered with </v>
<v Speaker 1>booby trapped explosives and chemical </v>

4107
04:10:23.011 --> 04:10:24.620
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck cleaning that moon scape up.</v>

4108
04:10:26.530 --> 04:10:31.530
<v Speaker 1>The Germans had thought that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>signing something more like an </v>

4109
04:10:31.530 --> 04:10:33.310
<v Speaker 1>armistice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more like a succession of hostilities,</v>

4110
04:10:33.490 --> 04:10:38.490
<v Speaker 1>more like some deal along the lines of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they thought Woodrow Wilson was </v>

4111
04:10:38.490 --> 04:10:42.331
<v Speaker 1>talking about in the 14 points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they ended up with was more like a </v>

4112
04:10:42.331 --> 04:10:46.210
<v Speaker 1>surrender and truly given their military</v>
<v Speaker 1>condition.</v>

4113
04:10:46.211 --> 04:10:48.280
<v Speaker 1>That's probably what they should have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been doing,</v>

4114
04:10:48.970 --> 04:10:53.970
<v Speaker 1>but even as the war was winding down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ludendorff changed his mind at the last </v>

4115
04:10:55.240 --> 04:11:00.240
<v Speaker 1>minute and wanted to restart the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict right before the armistice </v>

4116
04:11:00.240 --> 04:11:00.710
<v Speaker 1>actually took effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't that have been,</v>

4117
04:11:00.711 --> 04:11:01.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

4118
04:11:01.481 --> 04:11:03.310
<v Speaker 1>What if scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

4119
04:11:03.311 --> 04:11:08.311
<v Speaker 1>his army was ready to go home and in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of cases was going home by the end </v>

4120
04:11:08.311 --> 04:11:12.720
<v Speaker 1>and the Germans had at least a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that they thought were shirking </v>

4121
04:11:12.720 --> 04:11:16.080
<v Speaker 1>or not listening to orders or simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>refusing to fight anymore the deal at </v>

4122
04:11:16.241 --> 04:11:21.241
<v Speaker 1>the end of the war and the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Germans thought they were </v>

4123
04:11:21.241 --> 04:11:24.241
<v Speaker 1>getting versus what they actually got </v>
<v Speaker 1>was one of the seeds that sews the </v>

4124
04:11:24.241 --> 04:11:27.661
<v Speaker 1>future bitterness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The German navy manages to sort of give </v>

4125
04:11:27.661 --> 04:11:30.910
<v Speaker 1>the middle finger to the allies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4126
04:11:30.911 --> 04:11:34.270
<v Speaker 1>the year after the war is over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're transferring their fleet to</v>

4127
04:11:34.271 --> 04:11:39.271
<v Speaker 1>Britain as part of the mandated things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they had to do with the peace </v>

4128
04:11:39.271 --> 04:11:44.131
<v Speaker 1>treaty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they intentionally sink a bunch of </v>

4129
04:11:44.131 --> 04:11:44.131
<v Speaker 1>the ships.</v>

4130
04:11:44.230 --> 04:11:47.950
<v Speaker 1>So they may have rioted against their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own officers at the end of the war.</v>

4131
04:11:48.190 --> 04:11:53.190
<v Speaker 1>But that didn't mean they wanted the </v>
<v Speaker 1>former enemy to end up in possession of </v>

4132
04:11:53.190 --> 04:11:57.271
<v Speaker 1>their vessels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd also like to quickly mention </v>

4133
04:11:58.160 --> 04:12:03.160
<v Speaker 1>something that I think you're aware of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been throughout this whole </v>

4134
04:12:03.160 --> 04:12:05.711
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ripples of pain that these wars </v>

4135
04:12:05.711 --> 04:12:10.031
<v Speaker 1>and all these deaths and maimings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering's caused the number of people </v>

4136
04:12:10.031 --> 04:12:14.920
<v Speaker 1>in a relating to the or civilian who </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced the horribleness and how </v>

4137
04:12:14.920 --> 04:12:19.090
<v Speaker 1>that just radiates across societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go read the.</v>

4138
04:12:19.250 --> 04:12:24.250
<v Speaker 1>The artists have this postwar generation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and sometimes it's just so </v>

4139
04:12:24.250 --> 04:12:25.210
<v Speaker 1>incredibly haunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4140
04:12:25.211 --> 04:12:26.200
<v Speaker 1>you'll read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll talk about,</v>

4141
04:12:26.201 --> 04:12:31.201
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are all these women who </v>

4142
04:12:31.201 --> 04:12:31.201
<v Speaker 1>sweethearts or patrol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people that,</v>

4143
04:12:31.260 --> 04:12:36.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they maybe would've married somewhere </v>

4144
04:12:36.260 --> 04:12:37.801
<v Speaker 1>down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't exist because they died in the </v>

4145
04:12:37.801 --> 04:12:37.801
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they ended up spinsters.</v>

4146
04:12:37.801 --> 04:12:41.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean just decades of pain in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rippling through the societies and a </v>

4147
04:12:43.531 --> 04:12:48.531
<v Speaker 1>sense of loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And oftentimes in some of these nation </v>

4148
04:12:48.531 --> 04:12:51.260
<v Speaker 1>states plagued by chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4149
04:12:51.261 --> 04:12:53.680
<v Speaker 1>as they tried to find their new path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4150
04:12:53.681 --> 04:12:58.681
<v Speaker 1>Germany is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rushes and even better one people we're </v>

4151
04:12:58.681 --> 04:13:02.461
<v Speaker 1>often confused and sometimes caught up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the wheels of things that they had no</v>

4152
04:13:03.971 --> 04:13:08.971
<v Speaker 1>control over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How'd you like to be some civilian </v>

4153
04:13:08.971 --> 04:13:11.650
<v Speaker 1>living in a country that went fascist on</v>
<v Speaker 1>you or Bolshevik on you,</v>

4154
04:13:12.280 --> 04:13:13.450
<v Speaker 1>where that fell apart?</v>

4155
04:13:15.210 --> 04:13:20.210
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to point out that the problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this story that we did here is the </v>

4156
04:13:21.931 --> 04:13:25.110
<v Speaker 1>same problem you often run into if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4157
04:13:25.111 --> 04:13:27.840
<v Speaker 1>read or speak in the English language </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want to,</v>

4158
04:13:28.310 --> 04:13:33.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a hold of something about the first </v>

4159
04:13:33.310 --> 04:13:35.361
<v Speaker 1>world war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've often said that doing these </v>

4160
04:13:35.361 --> 04:13:37.701
<v Speaker 1>programs has given me the most sympathy </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the people who actually write these </v>

4161
04:13:39.241 --> 04:13:43.680
<v Speaker 1>books and create the materials that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>use as sources for this program,</v>

4162
04:13:43.681 --> 04:13:48.681
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because once you try to do even a pale </v>

4163
04:13:48.681 --> 04:13:51.280
<v Speaker 1>imitation of what they're trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you instantly see,</v>

4164
04:13:51.330 --> 04:13:52.890
<v Speaker 1>have all your questions answered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4165
04:13:52.891 --> 04:13:53.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4166
04:13:53.221 --> 04:13:58.221
<v Speaker 1>why didn't they do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you start to do this kind of a </v>

4167
04:13:58.221 --> 04:13:58.221
<v Speaker 1>show yourself and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

4168
04:13:58.221 --> 04:14:00.750
<v Speaker 1>how am I ever going to include this </v>
<v Speaker 1>without screwing something up?</v>

4169
04:14:01.080 --> 04:14:06.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's anybody who got really </v>

4170
04:14:06.080 --> 04:14:06.080
<v Speaker 1>shafted in this story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4171
04:14:06.080 --> 04:14:10.401
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can think of numerous peoples who </v>

4172
04:14:10.401 --> 04:14:10.401
<v Speaker 1>deserved a ton more time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we alluded to it earlier.</v>

4173
04:14:10.401 --> 04:14:12.570
<v Speaker 1>The French are an enormous part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

4174
04:14:12.571 --> 04:14:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even get to Clemons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's inexcusable,</v>

4175
04:14:15.061 --> 04:14:17.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you even get away with that?</v>

4176
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Carlin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I can say is look how long this </v>

4177
04:14:22.030 --> 04:14:22.920
<v Speaker 1>series is now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4178
04:14:23.430 --> 04:14:27.300
<v Speaker 1>I left out tons of stuff to get it down </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this enormous length.</v>

4179
04:14:27.301 --> 04:14:32.301
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that terrible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what about the people in the </v>

4180
04:14:32.301 --> 04:14:32.301
<v Speaker 1>Balkans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4181
04:14:32.301 --> 04:14:34.911
<v Speaker 1>This is where the whole war begins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the people who've had an </v>

4182
04:14:34.911 --> 04:14:36.210
<v Speaker 1>amazing history right before the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>world war.</v>

4183
04:14:36.250 --> 04:14:41.250
<v Speaker 1>They are finding themselves in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>national identity and consciousness is </v>

4184
04:14:41.250 --> 04:14:41.250
<v Speaker 1>all coming together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4185
04:14:41.250 --> 04:14:45.270
<v Speaker 1>it's a fantastically both traumatic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatic time of change.</v>

4186
04:14:45.271 --> 04:14:45.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4187
04:14:45.670 --> 04:14:47.400
<v Speaker 1>it's colorful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

4188
04:14:48.660 --> 04:14:50.690
<v Speaker 1>The situation in the Middle East with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ottomans and,</v>

4189
04:14:50.840 --> 04:14:51.350
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

4190
04:14:51.351 --> 04:14:56.351
<v Speaker 1>and the modern Middle East beginning to </v>
<v Speaker 1>form Africa got totally shafted in this </v>

4191
04:14:56.351 --> 04:15:01.341
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could have been a whole podcast series </v>

4192
04:15:01.341 --> 04:15:04.011
<v Speaker 1>on the first World War in Africa and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Far East is busy setting the stage for </v>

4193
04:15:04.011 --> 04:15:08.451
<v Speaker 1>the Pacific War and the Second World War</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we dealt with it minimally as a </v>

4194
04:15:09.501 --> 04:15:09.950
<v Speaker 1>point of</v>

4195
04:15:09.980 --> 04:15:14.980
<v Speaker 4>explanation though I might point out the</v>
<v Speaker 4>lack of good English works on this </v>

4196
04:15:16.821 --> 04:15:19.910
<v Speaker 4>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a lot of quotes from Germans,</v>

4197
04:15:19.911 --> 04:15:22.910
<v Speaker 4>a lot of quotes from British folks and </v>
<v Speaker 4>their dominions.</v>

4198
04:15:23.060 --> 04:15:28.060
<v Speaker 4>A lot of quotes from the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are not a ton of good books even </v>

4199
04:15:28.060 --> 04:15:31.781
<v Speaker 4>on the French where you get a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>firsthand accounts from soldiers are </v>

4200
04:15:31.781 --> 04:15:34.751
<v Speaker 4>their experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found one really good one and we've </v>

4201
04:15:34.751 --> 04:15:37.811
<v Speaker 4>used it in the show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if that guy wasn't at the battle </v>

4202
04:15:37.811 --> 04:15:39.941
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden the sources are hard to </v>

4203
04:15:39.941 --> 04:15:40.940
<v Speaker 4>come by.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Love to have more from the Russian side,</v>

4204
04:15:41.270 --> 04:15:45.740
<v Speaker 4>the Balkans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Ottomans to Africa would be great to</v>

4205
04:15:46.790 --> 04:15:51.790
<v Speaker 4>finally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were some subjects we could have </v>

4206
04:15:51.790 --> 04:15:51.790
<v Speaker 4>gone into more deeply that I know a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of you want.</v>

4207
04:15:52.040 --> 04:15:55.760
<v Speaker 4>I mean some of you people geek out about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the military side of history is I do.</v>

4208
04:15:56.360 --> 04:16:00.080
<v Speaker 4>We did do some discussions on airplanes </v>
<v Speaker 4>that didn't make it into the show.</v>

4209
04:16:00.081 --> 04:16:05.081
<v Speaker 4>We did some deeper stuff on the war </v>
<v Speaker 4>ships that did make it into another </v>

4210
04:16:05.081 --> 04:16:09.401
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those will all be rolled together with </v>

4211
04:16:09.401 --> 04:16:12.070
<v Speaker 4>some other popery I put together in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>extra show whenever we get that out and </v>

4212
04:16:12.070 --> 04:16:13.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm not promising when that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got another one of the real,</v>

4213
04:16:14.120 --> 04:16:19.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>regular history shows to start working </v>

4214
04:16:19.120 --> 04:16:19.120
<v Speaker 4>on right away because you folks have </v>
<v Speaker 4>been patient with me.</v>

4215
04:16:19.120 --> 04:16:21.770
<v Speaker 4>This one took longer than any we've ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>had in the past and will.</v>

4216
04:16:21.771 --> 04:16:24.320
<v Speaker 4>I guess you could probably see why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go look at the reading list.</v>

4217
04:16:24.620 --> 04:16:28.700
<v Speaker 4>Be Nice to do a subject that is not as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well documented next time.</v>

4218
04:16:29.120 --> 04:16:30.980
<v Speaker 4>Thank you for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
