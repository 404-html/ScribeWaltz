1
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.140
<v Speaker 1>It's hardcore history.</v>

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I've been podcasting since like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stone Age,</v>

3
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>2005 and way back then and for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time afterwards I kind of considered all</v>

4
00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:21.901
<v Speaker 1>the other people who were podcasting as </v>
<v Speaker 1>my colleagues were not really in the </v>

5
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:22.660
<v Speaker 1>sort of industry where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yes,</v>

6
00:00:22.661 --> 00:00:27.661
<v Speaker 1>my colleagues and we published papers or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the normal idea of of what you </v>

7
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:28.540
<v Speaker 1>might consider a colleague to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really felt the same.</v>

8
00:00:28.541 --> 00:00:33.541
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're struggling through the same </v>

9
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:34.861
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning the same thing as running into </v>

10
00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:36.661
<v Speaker 1>each other in places either in person or</v>
<v Speaker 1>digitally these days.</v>

11
00:00:37.061 --> 00:00:42.061
<v Speaker 1>Of course it's a lot harder to call </v>
<v Speaker 1>every podcast or your colleague when I </v>

12
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:44.020
<v Speaker 1>think I saw a number recently that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>north of 500,000</v>

13
00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:49.021
<v Speaker 1>podcast or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the person I'm about to talk to is </v>

14
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:51.190
<v Speaker 1>undoubtedly my podcast colleague </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

15
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>well heck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a history podcast or so right </v>

16
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in a pretty pretty small gene pool</v>

17
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.250
<v Speaker 1>and he is one of the great podcasters </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever is the history of Rome.</v>

18
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.620
<v Speaker 1>PODCAST is legendary in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sort of makes him the audio,</v>

19
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.800
<v Speaker 1>the modern audio equivalent of Edward </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gibbon,</v>

20
00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:14.290
<v Speaker 1>where he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes into like the length and breadth</v>

21
00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:19.291
<v Speaker 1>of the entire Roman experience to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall of the western empire.</v>

22
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>It's hugely popular and one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts that should be in some section </v>

23
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.311
<v Speaker 1>of the hall of fame someday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His other one is an amazingly ambitious </v>

24
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:31.360
<v Speaker 1>project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he pulls off wonderfully.</v>

25
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>And judging from the success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.970
<v Speaker 1>everyone seems to like revolutions where</v>
<v Speaker 1>he looks at different revolutions.</v>

27
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 1>So it'll be very interesting to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Duncan today about his new book,</v>

28
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.210
<v Speaker 1>the storm before the storm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't know enough about this,</v>

29
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.020
<v Speaker 1>his book will educate you wonderfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He show,</v>

30
00:01:53.021 --> 00:01:55.360
<v Speaker 1>of course is available out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did a,</v>

31
00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.420
<v Speaker 1>the longest series we ever did was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this period of Roman history in death </v>

32
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.360
<v Speaker 1>throes of the republic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's lots of stuff out there,</v>

33
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>but I have a feeling most of you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>already going to know a ton of this </v>

34
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.241
<v Speaker 1>stuff because Rome is wildly popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the first questions I </v>

35
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:12.640
<v Speaker 1>ask my history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast colleague,</v>

36
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.960
<v Speaker 1>the Great Mike Duncan.</v>

37
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Once upon a time I wanted to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast on Cleopatra and I sat down,</v>

38
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>decided it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordered a bunch of books,</v>

39
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:32.061
<v Speaker 1>and then tried to figure out where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should start the story of Cleopatra and </v>

40
00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:36.741
<v Speaker 1>every time I would go backwards I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>find a domino connected to another </v>

41
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>domino.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another domino long story short that</v>

42
00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:43.791
<v Speaker 1>show I wanted to do Cleopatra about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the show I wanted to do about </v>

43
00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:48.021
<v Speaker 1>Cleopatra turned into the longest series</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've ever done because you have to go </v>

44
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:49.790
<v Speaker 1>all the way back to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>a long way in Roman history for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamics to become,</v>

46
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even remotely clear and people tend to </v>

47
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.160
<v Speaker 1>focus on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>if this is the titanic story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual sinking of the ship.</v>

49
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 1>But Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your new book,</v>

50
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:06.601
<v Speaker 1>the storm before the storm is about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>iceberg and the striking of the iceberg,</v>

51
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell us a little bit about,</v>

52
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this story that most people don't know </v>

53
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.580
<v Speaker 1>as well as the actual sinking of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ship.</v>

54
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way that I put it in my book is the </v>

55
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.641
<v Speaker 2>storm before the storm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of the end of the Roman </v>

56
00:03:22.641 --> 00:03:24.510
<v Speaker 2>republic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it covers the period from 1:46</v>

57
00:03:24.511 --> 00:03:29.511
<v Speaker 2>BC around there to about 78 BC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the death of Sala and it covers</v>

58
00:03:30.121 --> 00:03:33.810
<v Speaker 2>the couple of generations before Julius </v>
<v Speaker 2>Caesar comes along,</v>

59
00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:37.650
<v Speaker 2>before Octavian comes along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before Antony and Cleopatra are around,</v>

60
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to start looking as you say it,</v>

61
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.500
<v Speaker 2>the things that led up to the collapse </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Roman republic rather than just </v>

62
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.340
<v Speaker 2>jumping right into it and you say it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

63
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.350
<v Speaker 2>people like to focus on the sinking of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ship.</v>

64
00:03:49.351 --> 00:03:50.610
<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

65
00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that jumping into Cesar is like jumping </v>

66
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 2>into a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

67
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the third act,</v>

68
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:56.960
<v Speaker 2>at the beginning of the third act where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

69
00:03:56.961 --> 00:03:57.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is,</v>

70
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loud and crazy and people are fighting </v>

71
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.211
<v Speaker 2>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And obviously people are really </v>

72
00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:05.211
<v Speaker 2>passionately committed to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

73
00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:08.961
<v Speaker 2>or the other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you don't know how it got to this </v>

74
00:04:08.961 --> 00:04:08.961
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what,</v>

75
00:04:08.961 --> 00:04:13.031
<v Speaker 2>what were the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were the problems that led the </v>

76
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:15.981
<v Speaker 2>republic to be so brittle that it could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be blown apart a couple of generations </v>

77
00:04:15.981 --> 00:04:20.691
<v Speaker 2>later and that's what I hope that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book is able to explore and then when </v>

78
00:04:20.691 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 2>you read it and you have completed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

79
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.550
<v Speaker 2>then you'll have a much richer </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of why we,</v>

80
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.500
<v Speaker 2>why what happens with Caesar happens.</v>

81
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about why we even care what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to Caesar.</v>

82
00:04:33.201 --> 00:04:38.201
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little amazed at the not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern but ongoing public interest and </v>

83
00:04:39.051 --> 00:04:43.340
<v Speaker 1>remember a public that is generally not </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought to be all that history,</v>

84
00:04:43.341 --> 00:04:48.341
<v Speaker 1>knowledgeable or even cared that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and yet we can continually </v>

85
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:50.210
<v Speaker 1>publish books and make movies and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have discussions that,</v>

86
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.340
<v Speaker 1>that draw comparisons to this republic </v>
<v Speaker 1>for more than 2000 years ago.</v>

87
00:04:55.341 --> 00:05:00.341
<v Speaker 1>What do you think accounts for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>enduring interest on the part of even </v>

88
00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:02.930
<v Speaker 1>lay people to this place where if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it,</v>

89
00:05:02.931 --> 00:05:07.931
<v Speaker 1>no one should even be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They shouldn't be in the front of </v>

90
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:07.931
<v Speaker 1>anyone's mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen hundred,</v>

91
00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:08.540
<v Speaker 1>2000 years ago.</v>

92
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.530
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good question.</v>

93
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

94
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people like us,</v>

95
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:15.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

96
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.270
<v Speaker 2>it's so inherently interesting that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost weird to step back and say like,</v>

97
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:23.110
<v Speaker 2>why would anybody be interested in Rome </v>
<v Speaker 2>because Rome is,</v>

98
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 2>at least to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So inherently interesting.</v>

99
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what it gets to is that people </v>

100
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people know that Rome was this ancient,</v>

101
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.870
<v Speaker 2>powerful civilization and it almost is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the epitome of what a imperial power is,</v>

102
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:46.381
<v Speaker 2>what civilizational power is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that it lasted for a thousand </v>

103
00:05:46.381 --> 00:05:47.230
<v Speaker 2>years or more if you include the </v>
<v Speaker 2>byzantines.</v>

104
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.560
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Rome is always going to have a </v>

105
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 2>place in the collective imagination as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you go.</v>

106
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:59.521
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you're at all interested in </v>

107
00:05:59.521 --> 00:06:01.930
<v Speaker 2>history at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go to sort of the big and </v>

108
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.821
<v Speaker 2>important parts of history and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always going to then wind up in </v>

109
00:06:03.821 --> 00:06:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Rome and specifically where people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to wind up is that,</v>

110
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.640
<v Speaker 2>is that era between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say the arrival of Julius Caesar </v>

111
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 2>and like the death of Nero ran at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>death of the Julio Cottey and dynasty,</v>

112
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:19.571
<v Speaker 2>that particular era of Roman history in </v>
<v Speaker 2>part because it's so well documented and</v>

113
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 2>we know so much about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

114
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 2>is always going to be the place where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people go a to.</v>

115
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 2>If they become interested in Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where they're going to wind up.</v>

116
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.310
<v Speaker 2>And it's a lot the same way that I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that no matter what,</v>

117
00:06:32.311 --> 00:06:37.311
<v Speaker 2>like the Napoleonic age is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>permanently something that people keep </v>

118
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 2>going back to and back to even 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years later.</v>

119
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:39.590
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

120
00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:41.340
<v Speaker 2>this is just like some obscure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

121
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 2>kind of temporary French empire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>

122
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 2>there is something about the force of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the personalities and the force of the,</v>

123
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 2>the political power that is being </v>
<v Speaker 2>expressed.</v>

124
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:52.390
<v Speaker 2>That's always going to draw people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

125
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

126
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.880
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see that with Napoleon just like I see</v>

127
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:58.750
<v Speaker 1>that with a Hitler or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even the Genghis Khan,</v>

128
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.760
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to me the difference is the length </v>

129
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.461
<v Speaker 1>of it instead of one supreme figure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is searing across the pages of the </v>

130
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:10.490
<v Speaker 1>history book and there are innately </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

131
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.310
<v Speaker 1>You have numerous figures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

132
00:07:13.311 --> 00:07:18.311
<v Speaker 1>just going through your book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one fascinating individual that </v>

133
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:20.520
<v Speaker 1>seems to be almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

134
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think about what the quota of </v>

135
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 1>great men should be in any given </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization during any given time,</v>

136
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.500
<v Speaker 1>the period disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your book seems to be an era where </v>

137
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.980
<v Speaker 1>humanity in that place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that time is exceeding its normal </v>

138
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.760
<v Speaker 1>quota of fascinating August human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

139
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.390
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

140
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.630
<v Speaker 2>And it's always been a bit surprising to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

141
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

142
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.470
<v Speaker 2>having gone through the history of Rome </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

143
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.230
<v Speaker 2>gone through the entire history of Rome </v>
<v Speaker 2>and pretty minute detail,</v>

144
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

145
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.780
<v Speaker 2>that particular period between the Pi </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then Maurice and Sala was always,</v>

146
00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was always a period that I wanted to</v>

147
00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:00.020
<v Speaker 2>come back to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

148
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.090
<v Speaker 2>I kinda had to put a pin in it very </v>
<v Speaker 2>early on and was like,</v>

149
00:08:03.091 --> 00:08:03.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

150
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:08.570
<v Speaker 2>this is an era that's gonna be a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be worth coming back to </v>

151
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.060
<v Speaker 2>and to have nobody really have written </v>
<v Speaker 2>the book that I wrote,</v>

152
00:08:12.061 --> 00:08:16.410
<v Speaker 2>which is let's just focus on this 50 or </v>
<v Speaker 2>60 year period all on its own.</v>

153
00:08:16.411 --> 00:08:21.411
<v Speaker 2>I won't make this the first couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>chapters and a larger book about the </v>

154
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:21.411
<v Speaker 2>fall of the republic.</v>

155
00:08:21.411 --> 00:08:24.480
<v Speaker 2>I won't make it one chapter in a larger </v>
<v Speaker 2>history about,</v>

156
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just Roman civilization.</v>

157
00:08:26.011 --> 00:08:28.890
<v Speaker 2>But to really like hone in on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular period.</v>

158
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:30.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

159
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:30.910
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd always kind of,</v>

160
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:35.950
<v Speaker 2>I would watch the lists with one I like </v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody going to finally discover </v>

161
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:37.410
<v Speaker 2>that this is a great untapped wealth of </v>
<v Speaker 2>material,</v>

162
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:38.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nobody,</v>

163
00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.680
<v Speaker 2>nobody quite put it together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was able to step in and,</v>

164
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:46.730
<v Speaker 2>and now I hope deliver a book that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>explain why.</v>

165
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.380
<v Speaker 2>I think when people end the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be like,</v>

166
00:08:49.381 --> 00:08:51.390
<v Speaker 2>why hasn't this been covered in more </v>
<v Speaker 2>detail?</v>

167
00:08:51.391 --> 00:08:53.940
<v Speaker 2>I think that'll be one of the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions coming out of it for people.</v>

168
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love your subtitle,</v>

169
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:57.480
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of the end of the Roman </v>
<v Speaker 1>republic.</v>

170
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 2>It sounds Churchill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ian,</v>

171
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:00.240
<v Speaker 2>but you maybe you could have called it </v>
<v Speaker 2>also,</v>

172
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

173
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:06.160
<v Speaker 2>the era when things broke because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that really is kind of what it was,</v>

174
00:09:06.161 --> 00:09:11.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can see like you were talking </v>

175
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:11.161
<v Speaker 2>about in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

176
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:11.161
<v Speaker 2>the Romans didn't have this written </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution.</v>

177
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:15.801
<v Speaker 2>They had sort of a set of conduct rules </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were just innately understood by </v>

178
00:09:16.741 --> 00:09:19.560
<v Speaker 2>everyone in customs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when they broke that,</v>

179
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

180
00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:25.281
<v Speaker 2>there is no written constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once someone violates the way we do </v>

181
00:09:25.281 --> 00:09:25.710
<v Speaker 2>things right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way of the elders,</v>

182
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all bets are off,</v>

183
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:29.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seemed that way.</v>

184
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were there,</v>

185
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:36.270
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this thing like when Rome </v>

186
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:36.670
<v Speaker 2>triumphs and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what happens in 1:46</v>

187
00:09:36.671 --> 00:09:38.080
<v Speaker 2>BC for people that aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

188
00:09:38.081 --> 00:09:43.081
<v Speaker 2>caught up with this is that Rome </v>
<v Speaker 2>conquered carthage for the last time.</v>

189
00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Their great rival.</v>

190
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean Hannibal during the second punic </v>
<v Speaker 2>war,</v>

191
00:09:46.091 --> 00:09:49.640
<v Speaker 2>that's about 50 years or so in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

192
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:54.930
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're great rivalry with carthage is </v>

193
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:54.930
<v Speaker 2>now over and Rome has emerged </v>
<v Speaker 2>victorious.</v>

194
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:59.220
<v Speaker 2>They also decide to just outright </v>
<v Speaker 2>conquer and annex grease into the Roman </v>

195
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.150
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at this point in 1:46</v>

196
00:10:01.151 --> 00:10:06.151
<v Speaker 2>BC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rome is without question the strongest </v>

197
00:10:06.151 --> 00:10:09.541
<v Speaker 2>power in the Mediterranean world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's going to be able to challenge </v>

198
00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:13.261
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is something about this trial </v>

199
00:10:13.261 --> 00:10:16.450
<v Speaker 2>actually opens up a whole host of new </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems for the Republican,</v>

200
00:10:16.451 --> 00:10:21.451
<v Speaker 2>for the leadership of the product that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they just sort of start to fail to </v>

201
00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:24.300
<v Speaker 2>address and fail to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it creates a powerfully new,</v>

202
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:29.310
<v Speaker 2>like confrontational style of domestic </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics that had never really existed </v>

203
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:34.171
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Roman Senate and the Roman elites </v>

204
00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:34.570
<v Speaker 2>had always been pretty clubby with each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

205
00:10:34.571 --> 00:10:35.620
<v Speaker 2>They had always been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

206
00:10:35.621 --> 00:10:36.720
<v Speaker 2>there are some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

207
00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.100
<v Speaker 2>will ultimately make compromises with </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

208
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we don't all agree on something,</v>

209
00:10:41.111 --> 00:10:42.610
<v Speaker 2>we'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just put it to bed.</v>

210
00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:48.180
<v Speaker 2>And what happens after 1:46</v>
<v Speaker 2>is you start having these leaders start </v>

211
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:51.361
<v Speaker 2>to break away and start to tap into new </v>
<v Speaker 2>energies that are floating around out </v>

212
00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:55.351
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with this new confrontational style </v>

213
00:10:55.351 --> 00:10:55.351
<v Speaker 2>of Roman politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

214
00:10:55.351 --> 00:11:00.091
<v Speaker 2>people start abandoning those old </v>
<v Speaker 2>unwritten norms and unspoken a modes of </v>

215
00:11:00.671 --> 00:11:03.490
<v Speaker 2>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once you start down that road,</v>

216
00:11:03.491 --> 00:11:06.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean tell you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can pull out of it what,</v>

217
00:11:06.321 --> 00:11:08.950
<v Speaker 2>what happened to the Romans is that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were not able to pull out of it.</v>

218
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:14.490
<v Speaker 2>And if you start going down this road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ultimately discovered that even </v>

219
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.420
<v Speaker 2>written laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even following written laws,</v>

220
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:19.330
<v Speaker 2>is merely accustomed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's merely a norm.</v>

221
00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

222
00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:25.290
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing about a piece of paper </v>
<v Speaker 2>with laws written on it that compels me </v>

223
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.460
<v Speaker 2>to do anything to follow that law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just simply,</v>

224
00:11:27.461 --> 00:11:31.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm giving it power with my own because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how we do things.</v>

225
00:11:31.061 --> 00:11:34.140
<v Speaker 2>But if somebody say as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

226
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:37.570
<v Speaker 2>an army or a gun or a baseball bat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

227
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.590
<v Speaker 2>that actually is the ultimate definer of</v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

228
00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:46.710
<v Speaker 2>It's just brute force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So once you start giving up on sort of </v>

229
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.710
<v Speaker 2>what you would call,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

230
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:51.510
<v Speaker 2>minor unspoken rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eventually will get to the point </v>

231
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 2>where everybody has to admit that only </v>
<v Speaker 2>brute force is really what's at play.</v>

232
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that line,</v>

233
00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.110
<v Speaker 1>whether it was really sad or not that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

234
00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:03.230
<v Speaker 1>history doesn't repeat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it sometimes rhymes and I look at </v>

235
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.430
<v Speaker 1>the Roman republic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like everyone does and you know,</v>

236
00:12:05.431 --> 00:12:07.390
<v Speaker 1>it's hard not to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

237
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:12.710
<v Speaker 1>patterns and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and similar dynamics and I think if for </v>

238
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.630
<v Speaker 1>no other reason than because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>another commercial republic that's large</v>

239
00:12:15.631 --> 00:12:20.631
<v Speaker 1>and imperial and right there you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have some things that look </v>

240
00:12:20.631 --> 00:12:21.060
<v Speaker 1>similar and we all understand that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you look a little beneath the surface,</v>

241
00:12:21.061 --> 00:12:22.560
<v Speaker 1>there's a ton of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

242
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean slavery outright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery for example.</v>

243
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:30.410
<v Speaker 1>But you point out in your book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought it was interesting you </v>

244
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:32.661
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were drawn comparisons to if the US </v>

245
00:12:32.661 --> 00:12:36.060
<v Speaker 1>and the Roman republic are following a </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar charted course,</v>

246
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:41.090
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where would we be now in terms of where </v>

247
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.810
<v Speaker 1>the Romans were?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you talk a little about that?</v>

248
00:12:42.811 --> 00:12:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Because I thought that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

249
00:12:43.831 --> 00:12:46.620
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the punic wars is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world wars and whatnot,</v>

250
00:12:46.621 --> 00:12:49.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a fascinating way to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to a conclusion saying,</v>

251
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.880
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done this,</v>

252
00:12:50.881 --> 00:12:51.960
<v Speaker 1>we've done this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done this,</v>

253
00:12:51.961 --> 00:12:56.961
<v Speaker 1>we haven't done this yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where do you put us in the book </v>

254
00:12:56.961 --> 00:12:56.961
<v Speaker 1>compared to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

255
00:12:56.961 --> 00:12:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Roman history in a similar place.</v>

256
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:01.570
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all,</v>

257
00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:06.571
<v Speaker 2>all caveats aside that this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not actually the way that </v>

258
00:13:06.571 --> 00:13:07.860
<v Speaker 2>history works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not like in some.</v>

259
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.620
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're speculating wildly and it responds</v>

260
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.700
<v Speaker 1>to absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

261
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:15.030
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>

262
00:13:15.031 --> 00:13:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to my show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

263
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

264
00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:23.701
<v Speaker 2>So let's say that the Roman Empire is </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there and there was like a thousand </v>

265
00:13:23.701 --> 00:13:28.320
<v Speaker 2>years worth of history and we're sitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>here in the United States or in the </v>

266
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.981
<v Speaker 2>West.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally at the beginning of the 21st </v>

267
00:13:31.981 --> 00:13:31.981
<v Speaker 2>century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to say like,</v>

268
00:13:31.981 --> 00:13:31.981
<v Speaker 2>w,</v>
<v Speaker 2>w what,</v>

269
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:35.050
<v Speaker 2>what is there that we can look to in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Roman history is,</v>

270
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:40.080
<v Speaker 2>is there a period in time that we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>look to that is more analogous to our </v>

271
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.400
<v Speaker 2>own situation than another and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

272
00:13:42.401 --> 00:13:45.760
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot by process of elimination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

273
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:46.700
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

274
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:51.670
<v Speaker 2>are we a brand new little city state </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has just recently been colonized or</v>

275
00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:52.780
<v Speaker 2>founded by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

276
00:13:52.781 --> 00:13:56.290
<v Speaker 2>a group of a dissident and vagabonds and</v>
<v Speaker 2>escaped slaves,</v>

277
00:13:56.291 --> 00:14:01.291
<v Speaker 2>like know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happened 400 years ago in our own </v>

278
00:14:01.291 --> 00:14:01.291
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be,</v>

279
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:06.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the early days of the colonization of </v>

280
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:06.640
<v Speaker 2>North America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

281
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.530
<v Speaker 2>are we at a stage where a group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgruntled aristocrats overthrows the </v>

282
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.611
<v Speaker 2>king and establishes a new king list </v>
<v Speaker 2>republic that is more or less an elite </v>

283
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:16.180
<v Speaker 2>lead oligarchy.</v>

284
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

285
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:18.910
<v Speaker 2>that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anything,</v>

286
00:14:18.911 --> 00:14:19.440
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

287
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:20.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the founding fathers,</v>

288
00:14:20.621 --> 00:14:23.120
<v Speaker 2>that's the American revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

289
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.730
<v Speaker 2>then what Rome does is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it emerges as,</v>

290
00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:28.240
<v Speaker 2>as a new republic and over the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of hundred years,</v>

291
00:14:28.241 --> 00:14:33.070
<v Speaker 2>it starts to expand slowly across Italy </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a series of a series of wars.</v>

292
00:14:33.071 --> 00:14:38.071
<v Speaker 2>There collectively dub the Sam night </v>
<v Speaker 2>wars that wind up with Rome being the </v>

293
00:14:38.071 --> 00:14:41.710
<v Speaker 2>most dominant power in the Italian </v>
<v Speaker 2>peninsula on the Italian peninsula.</v>

294
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:46.030
<v Speaker 2>So it was the United States a recently </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerged regional power.</v>

295
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

296
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:52.020
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that anybody would </v>

297
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.671
<v Speaker 2>describe the United States as a recently</v>
<v Speaker 2>emerged regional power and all of that </v>

298
00:14:53.671 --> 00:14:54.560
<v Speaker 2>probably corresponds to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

299
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:59.710
<v Speaker 2>our slow and steady conquest of North </v>
<v Speaker 2>America and everything that we did to </v>

300
00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:00.950
<v Speaker 2>the American Indians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

301
00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:05.300
<v Speaker 2>battling with Mexico and taking their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire north half of their country.</v>

302
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.970
<v Speaker 2>And then you even get later on and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

303
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:13.390
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after that Rome goes to war with </v>

304
00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Carthage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes to war with Greece,</v>

305
00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.050
<v Speaker 2>goes to war in Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they emerge as this dominant,</v>

306
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:20.170
<v Speaker 2>what you might call a global power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least in the context of the </v>

307
00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:20.170
<v Speaker 2>Mediterranean.</v>

308
00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:24.670
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States isn't even there </v>

309
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:24.670
<v Speaker 2>because we did all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

310
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.060
<v Speaker 2>we are one of the acknowledged great </v>
<v Speaker 2>powers.</v>

311
00:15:26.061 --> 00:15:29.030
<v Speaker 2>And especially after the Cold War in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 nineties,</v>

312
00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.990
<v Speaker 2>you were describing the United States as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hyper power almost.</v>

313
00:15:31.991 --> 00:15:34.970
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's been tempered quite a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit in the last few years,</v>

314
00:15:34.971 --> 00:15:39.971
<v Speaker 2>but certainly we're not finding our </v>
<v Speaker 2>footing for the first time as a global </v>

315
00:15:39.971 --> 00:15:41.240
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been dealing with those issues.</v>

316
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

317
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.150
<v Speaker 2>since the end of world war two and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the Cold War.</v>

318
00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:47.300
<v Speaker 2>So then you push forward a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>more and you say,</v>

319
00:15:47.301 --> 00:15:49.040
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well has the republic,</v>

320
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:50.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have we collapsed into a,</v>

321
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:54.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a generations long civil war war,</v>

322
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.320
<v Speaker 2>a war Lord has in effect a emerged </v>
<v Speaker 2>victorious from and set himself up as a </v>

323
00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:01.040
<v Speaker 2>dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

324
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:06.160
<v Speaker 2>that hasn't happened yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we haven't gotten to that point </v>

325
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:06.770
<v Speaker 2>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the republic has not yet collapsed,</v>

326
00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:09.710
<v Speaker 2>and I certainly don't believe that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>republic has collapsed.</v>

327
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you say,</v>

328
00:16:11.991 --> 00:16:16.991
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe the United States is kind of </v>

329
00:16:16.991 --> 00:16:19.001
<v Speaker 2>now roughly in this same setting where </v>
<v Speaker 2>after Rome had emerged as a global </v>

330
00:16:19.001 --> 00:16:20.030
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before the republic collapsed,</v>

331
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.400
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look at this era.</v>

332
00:16:22.401 --> 00:16:24.500
<v Speaker 2>It's the beginning of the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>republic,</v>

333
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.630
<v Speaker 2>which is right after this period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1:46</v>

334
00:16:26.631 --> 00:16:31.631
<v Speaker 2>BC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which as we said earlier in the show </v>

335
00:16:31.631 --> 00:16:34.770
<v Speaker 2>earlier in this interview was because </v>
<v Speaker 2>already a period that is inherently </v>

336
00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.740
<v Speaker 2>fascinating in its own right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as it turns out,</v>

337
00:16:36.741 --> 00:16:41.741
<v Speaker 2>I think that they were dealing with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of issues that you could say the </v>

338
00:16:41.741 --> 00:16:44.240
<v Speaker 2>United States is dealing with right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's worth going through what the</v>

339
00:16:44.241 --> 00:16:47.000
<v Speaker 2>Romans went through and how they </v>
<v Speaker 2>responded to it.</v>

340
00:16:47.001 --> 00:16:48.140
<v Speaker 2>And maybe it could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

341
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.440
<v Speaker 2>maybe it could influence how we decide </v>
<v Speaker 2>to deal with our own problems.</v>

342
00:16:51.441 --> 00:16:51.740
<v Speaker 2>Today.</v>

343
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:57.570
<v Speaker 1>I was playing a silly game while I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading your book is to remind me of a </v>

344
00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.660
<v Speaker 1>bunch of things that I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't looked at in a while and,</v>

345
00:16:59.661 --> 00:17:04.661
<v Speaker 1>and the battles over public land and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution of land to veterans and all</v>

346
00:17:04.901 --> 00:17:07.450
<v Speaker 1>that stuff in the problem that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romans were having,</v>

347
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.690
<v Speaker 1>keeping armies in the field when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were essentially,</v>

348
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:13.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscripts is not really the right word,</v>

349
00:17:13.571 --> 00:17:17.380
<v Speaker 1>but farmer armies that had to go home </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tend to their home.</v>

350
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:22.710
<v Speaker 1>We're now on long service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand miles away from home and the </v>

351
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:24.400
<v Speaker 1>farm's going to hack and how long can </v>
<v Speaker 1>you maintain?</v>

352
00:17:24.401 --> 00:17:25.540
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

353
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:30.690
<v Speaker 1>if we tried to run our current foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy in the United States with a </v>

354
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:34.330
<v Speaker 1>military that was operating with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>draft situation that we had,</v>

355
00:17:34.331 --> 00:17:37.870
<v Speaker 1>say in the 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we could do it,</v>

356
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:41.320
<v Speaker 1>how much does the dynamic of having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

357
00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of veterans coming home from </v>

358
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:46.570
<v Speaker 1>these wars and having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

359
00:17:46.571 --> 00:17:51.571
<v Speaker 1>real gripes about the situation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they find themselves in the fact that </v>

360
00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:55.731
<v Speaker 1>they might have to go back in service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that their homes are falling </v>

361
00:17:55.731 --> 00:17:56.940
<v Speaker 1>apart while they're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to talk a little about that dynamic</v>

362
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.180
<v Speaker 2>check.</v>

363
00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Reminds me a little the fry core in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany or the bonus marchers in our own</v>

364
00:18:02.861 --> 00:18:03.400
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

365
00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.690
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of long service military </v>
<v Speaker 1>veterans angry with nothing to do.</v>

366
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like a recipe for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

367
00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.050
<v Speaker 1>political change.</v>

368
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

369
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:18.100
<v Speaker 2>I would say so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what what is happening is it's one </v>

370
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:18.410
<v Speaker 2>of these situations where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

371
00:18:18.411 --> 00:18:21.590
<v Speaker 2>the Romans or had been more or less </v>
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>

372
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.920
<v Speaker 2>what you might call a glorified militia </v>
<v Speaker 2>were you were,</v>

373
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.140
<v Speaker 2>you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would enter into the service,</v>

374
00:18:27.141 --> 00:18:28.410
<v Speaker 2>you would actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

375
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.890
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

376
00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.230
<v Speaker 2>if harvest time came and everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 2>still fighting each other,</v>

377
00:18:31.231 --> 00:18:36.231
<v Speaker 2>like both sides would quit the field and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody would go home and harvest </v>

378
00:18:36.231 --> 00:18:39.491
<v Speaker 2>their fields.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these imperial wars of expansion </v>

379
00:18:39.491 --> 00:18:41.330
<v Speaker 2>that Rome got caught in a yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starts to take the poor,</v>

380
00:18:41.331 --> 00:18:43.910
<v Speaker 2>the lower class citizens away from their</v>
<v Speaker 2>farms,</v>

381
00:18:43.911 --> 00:18:46.550
<v Speaker 2>away from their families for longer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer periods of time.</v>

382
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.200
<v Speaker 2>And so this period of triumph is for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

383
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.480
<v Speaker 2>for the Roman state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the republic itself as an entity.</v>

384
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.200
<v Speaker 2>The Senate and the people of Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

385
00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:02.020
<v Speaker 2>turns out to be fairly economically </v>
<v Speaker 2>disastrous for a lot of these lower </v>

386
00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.140
<v Speaker 2>class a Roman citizens.</v>

387
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.060
<v Speaker 2>They're going to start to lose their </v>
<v Speaker 2>farms.</v>

388
00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:08.000
<v Speaker 2>They're going to start to get bought out</v>
<v Speaker 2>by wealthy neighbors because you take,</v>

389
00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:11.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd rather take some money and get out</v>

390
00:19:11.031 --> 00:19:13.130
<v Speaker 2>while you can then watch it all go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ruin.</v>

391
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.190
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really does.</v>

392
00:19:15.191 --> 00:19:15.920
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the bonus,</v>

393
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.380
<v Speaker 2>the bonus marchers are a good example of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

394
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:21.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which happened right before,</v>

395
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:22.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

396
00:19:22.101 --> 00:19:27.101
<v Speaker 2>right in the midst of the Great </v>
<v Speaker 2>Depression here in the United States is </v>

397
00:19:27.101 --> 00:19:28.280
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had these grievances,</v>

398
00:19:28.281 --> 00:19:33.281
<v Speaker 2>they had these legitimate grievances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their families had had these farms for </v>

399
00:19:33.281 --> 00:19:34.250
<v Speaker 2>in perpetuity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

400
00:19:34.251 --> 00:19:39.251
<v Speaker 2>going back into the misty eras of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>early republic or even the kingdom days </v>

401
00:19:39.251 --> 00:19:41.060
<v Speaker 2>and they've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're now starting to lose all of that</v>

402
00:19:41.061 --> 00:19:46.061
<v Speaker 2>and their traditional ways of life are </v>
<v Speaker 2>being upset and they are feeling that </v>

403
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:50.740
<v Speaker 2>the Senate and the government of Rome is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

404
00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.780
<v Speaker 2>they are consolidating all of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>massive imperial wealth.</v>

405
00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.200
<v Speaker 2>But none of it seems to be trickling </v>
<v Speaker 2>down to the poor farmers,</v>

406
00:19:57.201 --> 00:20:00.810
<v Speaker 2>to the poorer citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have a,</v>

407
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.840
<v Speaker 2>you have a situation where these new </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaders,</v>

408
00:20:02.841 --> 00:20:03.920
<v Speaker 2>as I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

409
00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.710
<v Speaker 2>you can start to break out and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

410
00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a noble leader,</v>

411
00:20:08.631 --> 00:20:09.290
<v Speaker 2>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

412
00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:12.290
<v Speaker 2>I think that there's an opportunity for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me here to,</v>

413
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:17.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get enormous political influence and </v>

414
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.611
<v Speaker 2>political power and political popularity</v>
<v Speaker 2>by promising these people who have all </v>

415
00:20:20.611 --> 00:20:21.170
<v Speaker 2>these grievances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to,</v>

416
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to solve your problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to go to the rich.</v>

417
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.990
<v Speaker 2>We're going to take their land by </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically by force.</v>

418
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.140
<v Speaker 2>We're going to chop it up and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to redistribute it to all of you.</v>

419
00:20:30.141 --> 00:20:32.960
<v Speaker 2>This is an incredibly popular thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be done.</v>

420
00:20:32.961 --> 00:20:37.961
<v Speaker 2>And this opens the new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like pop goolarri style of Roman </v>

421
00:20:37.961 --> 00:20:42.431
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is instead of this elite noble </v>

422
00:20:42.431 --> 00:20:43.730
<v Speaker 2>consensus being the driver of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies,</v>

423
00:20:43.731 --> 00:20:48.731
<v Speaker 2>it's directly appealing to the rural </v>
<v Speaker 2>peasants in the urban plebs who are </v>

424
00:20:48.731 --> 00:20:53.521
<v Speaker 2>feeling negative effects from Rome's </v>
<v Speaker 2>imperial tramp rather than a bunch of </v>

425
00:20:53.521 --> 00:20:53.770
<v Speaker 2>positive effects.</v>

426
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it brings up the age old question.</v>

427
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:59.320
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to get your opinion on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a guy who's talked about roam as much</v>

428
00:20:59.321 --> 00:21:03.070
<v Speaker 1>or more than anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can think of the idea that,</v>

429
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:08.200
<v Speaker 1>that these people who appealed to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular crowd or were they really,</v>

430
00:21:09.761 --> 00:21:11.890
<v Speaker 1>was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that a real position or was that,</v>

431
00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just had latched onto a political,</v>

432
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

433
00:21:15.401 --> 00:21:17.380
<v Speaker 1>when they put their finger in the wind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out,</v>

434
00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:22.381
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this cause of giving land to the </v>

435
00:21:22.381 --> 00:21:22.381
<v Speaker 1>veterans is popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll do that.</v>

436
00:21:22.381 --> 00:21:23.740
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if I look at it as a,</v>

437
00:21:23.741 --> 00:21:28.741
<v Speaker 1>as a novice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these reformers look more real </v>

438
00:21:28.741 --> 00:21:29.700
<v Speaker 1>than others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

439
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.000
<v Speaker 1>do you have a feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like,</v>

440
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ks and Tiberias groggy.</v>

441
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me those seem people always like to </v>

442
00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:39.010
<v Speaker 1>compare them to the Kennedy brothers </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's ridiculous.</v>

443
00:21:39.011 --> 00:21:41.890
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time you have two </v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers both assassinated,</v>

444
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:47.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both that a lot of people were able to </v>

445
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.230
<v Speaker 1>romantically put a lot of hopes in and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lionize afterwards.</v>

446
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you look at those guys as,</v>

447
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:54.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as sincere reformers or are they all </v>

448
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:54.940
<v Speaker 1>charlatans work in a political angle?</v>

449
00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

450
00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:57.890
<v Speaker 2>or are none of them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

451
00:21:57.891 --> 00:21:58.370
<v Speaker 2>I had no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

452
00:21:58.371 --> 00:22:00.130
<v Speaker 2>I have an answer to this because now </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

453
00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.810
<v Speaker 2>now I've gone through it and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you point out,</v>

454
00:22:02.811 --> 00:22:07.811
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the great debates in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Roman history generally,</v>

455
00:22:07.881 --> 00:22:10.610
<v Speaker 2>and also just like world history in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general is,</v>

456
00:22:10.611 --> 00:22:12.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are these various popular reformers,</v>

457
00:22:12.861 --> 00:22:17.861
<v Speaker 2>are they merely cynical demagogues or </v>
<v Speaker 2>are they genuinely interested in </v>

458
00:22:17.861 --> 00:22:19.250
<v Speaker 2>reforming the state?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

459
00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:22.670
<v Speaker 2>and certainly even while they were still</v>
<v Speaker 2>alive,</v>

460
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.470
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their um,</v>

461
00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.000
<v Speaker 2>their allies were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

462
00:22:26.001 --> 00:22:26.570
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

463
00:22:26.571 --> 00:22:31.571
<v Speaker 2>they're driven by lofty ideals and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a genuine regard for the people and </v>

464
00:22:31.571 --> 00:22:33.620
<v Speaker 2>their enemies are producing pamphlet to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the say,</v>

465
00:22:33.621 --> 00:22:34.460
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

466
00:22:34.461 --> 00:22:36.680
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to make themselves the </v>
<v Speaker 2>new kings of Rome.</v>

467
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:38.970
<v Speaker 2>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

468
00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:44.080
<v Speaker 2>I do come down on it about the Grok.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I in particular that I think that they </v>

469
00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.380
<v Speaker 2>were interested in genuine reform.</v>

470
00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.820
<v Speaker 2>There was no like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>altruism at work here.</v>

471
00:22:49.821 --> 00:22:50.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about like,</v>

472
00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:56.170
<v Speaker 2>hi Roman politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of altruism going </v>

473
00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.970
<v Speaker 2>around out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that they saw simultaneously</v>

474
00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.470
<v Speaker 2>that a path to personal power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what they were after,</v>

475
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.420
<v Speaker 2>they were incredibly ambitious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

476
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:10.570
<v Speaker 2>could simultaneously solve a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems that Rome was now dealing with </v>

477
00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:13.470
<v Speaker 2>as it transitioned from being merely an </v>
<v Speaker 2>Italian city state.</v>

478
00:23:13.471 --> 00:23:16.460
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one among many to like the rulers of the</v>

479
00:23:16.461 --> 00:23:19.010
<v Speaker 2>entire Mediterranean world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

480
00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.840
<v Speaker 2>but they existed on a spectrum where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same,</v>

481
00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:24.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same meal,</v>

482
00:23:24.951 --> 00:23:29.780
<v Speaker 2>you have popolare energy coming out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rural peasants or the urban plebs,</v>

483
00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:35.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the lower equestrian classes that </v>

484
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:35.080
<v Speaker 2>have a lot of wealth but don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of,</v>

485
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>input politically,</v>

486
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:41.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those can be harnessed by people like </v>

487
00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.261
<v Speaker 2>the Grok I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can also be harnessed by </v>

488
00:23:44.261 --> 00:23:44.261
<v Speaker 2>cynical demagogues who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

489
00:23:44.261 --> 00:23:46.400
<v Speaker 2>are just there to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're angry.</v>

490
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.280
<v Speaker 2>I know that you're angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to help you channel that anger</v>

491
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to tell you who's to blame</v>
<v Speaker 2>for all of your problems.</v>

492
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:57.641
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm going to point you at the </v>

493
00:23:57.641 --> 00:23:57.641
<v Speaker 2>people who I'm telling you are to blame </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

494
00:23:57.641 --> 00:23:57.641
<v Speaker 2>And a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

495
00:23:57.641 --> 00:24:02.531
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who are to blame for it are </v>

496
00:24:02.531 --> 00:24:03.980
<v Speaker 2>my personal enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can use that same sort of,</v>

497
00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.040
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes quite a revolutionary energy.</v>

498
00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can start to use that and manipulate</v>

499
00:24:10.251 --> 00:24:15.251
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's never fair to say that </v>

500
00:24:15.251 --> 00:24:17.060
<v Speaker 2>all of them are sincere reformers and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or all of them are cynical demagogues.</v>

501
00:24:17.061 --> 00:24:22.061
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite a mix of the two and people </v>

502
00:24:22.061 --> 00:24:22.220
<v Speaker 2>are going to land on a spectrum and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>

503
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people bring up the Kennedy Brothers for</v>

504
00:24:25.401 --> 00:24:30.401
<v Speaker 2>the Rock Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't really hold a lot of </v>

505
00:24:30.401 --> 00:24:30.401
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

506
00:24:30.401 --> 00:24:32.120
<v Speaker 2>but if there is anybody in American </v>
<v Speaker 2>history who does look like the Rock,</v>

507
00:24:32.121 --> 00:24:34.290
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the roosevelts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

508
00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:39.480
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what theater Roosevelt and Franklin </v>

509
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.970
<v Speaker 2>Roosevelt and that the progressive </v>
<v Speaker 2>reforms that they were making,</v>

510
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.240
<v Speaker 2>both of them were incredibly ambitious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of them wanted to be president.</v>

511
00:24:44.241 --> 00:24:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Both of them kind of wanted to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>president forever.</v>

512
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:46.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

513
00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:48.890
<v Speaker 1>and they were called traitors to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

514
00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were,</v>

515
00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:50.800
<v Speaker 2>of course they were the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

516
00:24:50.801 --> 00:24:53.320
<v Speaker 2>And so they're very similar to the GROK </v>
<v Speaker 2>I in that way that they were,</v>

517
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:54.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inner inner,</v>

518
00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:56.980
<v Speaker 2>inner circle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobility and uh,</v>

519
00:24:57.250 --> 00:25:02.250
<v Speaker 2>they're using all of their power and </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth and influence to really disrupt </v>

520
00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:06.481
<v Speaker 2>what the elites have going for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think if anybody is out there in </v>

521
00:25:06.481 --> 00:25:07.780
<v Speaker 2>American history that does look like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>

522
00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:08.710
<v Speaker 2>it's probably the Roosevelt.</v>

523
00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm enjoying the analogy comparison too </v>

524
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:13.880
<v Speaker 1>much to stop now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you can give me,</v>

525
00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.350
<v Speaker 1>have you ever thought about some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these other figures in your book and </v>

526
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:19.170
<v Speaker 1>thought about American examples?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

527
00:25:19.171 --> 00:25:22.110
<v Speaker 1>I can look at like a huey long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

528
00:25:22.111 --> 00:25:24.990
<v Speaker 1>and see someone that maybe would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>fit back into the Roman things.</v>

529
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.770
<v Speaker 1>I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it Manchester?</v>

530
00:25:26.771 --> 00:25:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Manchester's book on Macarthur and </v>
<v Speaker 1>American Caesar.</v>

531
00:25:29.071 --> 00:25:30.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always comparisons.</v>

532
00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:25:31.321 --> 00:25:33.690
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the Solos in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>maurices and Cato,</v>

534
00:25:33.691 --> 00:25:36.630
<v Speaker 1>the elder and all those folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have any analogies that you often</v>

535
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:39.180
<v Speaker 1>think of when you think of some of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>major figures?</v>

536
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to,</v>

537
00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to rain on anybody's parade,</v>

538
00:25:44.291 --> 00:25:49.291
<v Speaker 2>but once you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you get onto that like granular </v>

539
00:25:49.291 --> 00:25:49.291
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

540
00:25:49.291 --> 00:25:49.300
<v Speaker 2>like who is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

541
00:25:49.301 --> 00:25:50.920
<v Speaker 2>who would this be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

542
00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.400
<v Speaker 2>it does start to get harder to pin </v>
<v Speaker 2>people down.</v>

543
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.790
<v Speaker 2>Like was macarthur was Macarthur and </v>
<v Speaker 2>American Caesar.</v>

544
00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:58.870
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

545
00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.420
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like probably a good thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that truman fired him.</v>

546
00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an insult to Caesar myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm biased.</v>

547
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

548
00:26:07.221 --> 00:26:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say so.</v>

549
00:26:08.001 --> 00:26:08.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

550
00:26:08.931 --> 00:26:13.931
<v Speaker 2>I have of all the people that I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone through that you can compare to </v>

551
00:26:13.931 --> 00:26:14.630
<v Speaker 2>Julius Caesar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like it's Napoleon.</v>

552
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:16.100
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

553
00:26:16.101 --> 00:26:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Nobody else really like measures up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that particular class of,</v>

554
00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:23.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having the totality of like I'm,</v>

555
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:28.040
<v Speaker 2>I can be genocidal and also like reform </v>
<v Speaker 2>the metric system and I'm a genius.</v>

556
00:26:28.041 --> 00:26:33.041
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I successfully dodged the </v>

557
00:26:33.041 --> 00:26:33.041
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

558
00:26:33.041 --> 00:26:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

559
00:26:33.391 --> 00:26:34.490
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well done.</v>

560
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

561
00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:40.780
<v Speaker 1>so okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then let's talk then a little bit </v>

562
00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.110
<v Speaker 1>about the dynamics here because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

563
00:26:42.111 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because when look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Roman system,</v>

564
00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:47.130
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be the wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you want to go to the Greeks,</v>

565
00:26:47.131 --> 00:26:52.131
<v Speaker 1>but it's the wonderful example of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the class divisions and then the </v>

566
00:26:52.131 --> 00:26:55.980
<v Speaker 1>problems inherent with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with class warfare and sharing of power.</v>

567
00:26:56.310 --> 00:27:01.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you want it to describe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're talking about the iceberg </v>

568
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:04.371
<v Speaker 1>that sinks the titanic here and we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about rules shifting and warlords </v>

569
00:27:04.371 --> 00:27:05.310
<v Speaker 1>and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

570
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:10.340
<v Speaker 1>but what was it that shifted in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a public being willing to accept </v>

571
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.830
<v Speaker 1>senatorial control by a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you pointed out in the book,</v>

572
00:27:13.831 --> 00:27:17.380
<v Speaker 1>a really small number of people in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental sense and,</v>

573
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:18.750
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be able to push.</v>

574
00:27:18.751 --> 00:27:19.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

575
00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:24.450
<v Speaker 1>the tribune of the plebs was one </v>
<v Speaker 1>systemic tool that was introduced to </v>

576
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:29.421
<v Speaker 1>help balance out those powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you say that that whole era </v>

577
00:27:29.421 --> 00:27:33.201
<v Speaker 1>between Tiberius Caracas and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>Caesar is an example of class warfare </v>

578
00:27:34.021 --> 00:27:35.070
<v Speaker 1>sort of playing out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

579
00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:40.071
<v Speaker 1>how much of a role would you give to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that ambitious men versus class warfare </v>

580
00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.940
<v Speaker 1>versus cycles and trends?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

581
00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:47.940
<v Speaker 2>really difficult to get into because </v>
<v Speaker 2>Roman politics did operate differently </v>

582
00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:54.130
<v Speaker 2>than modern western politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the client system.</v>

583
00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:55.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

584
00:27:55.181 --> 00:27:57.520
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first and most important thing is to</v>

585
00:27:57.521 --> 00:28:02.200
<v Speaker 2>say that these are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are more like clan rivalries than,</v>

586
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:04.570
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than class warfare where,</v>

587
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:05.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a,</v>

588
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:10.430
<v Speaker 2>you're a patron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a leader and you have this </v>

589
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.430
<v Speaker 2>network of clients who are all attached </v>
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>

590
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:13.810
<v Speaker 2>And then your political rivals have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>same network of,</v>

591
00:28:13.811 --> 00:28:18.811
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of clients who were all attached to </v>

592
00:28:18.811 --> 00:28:18.811
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is really like,</v>

593
00:28:18.811 --> 00:28:20.290
<v Speaker 2>this is really clans running into each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other with,</v>

594
00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:25.320
<v Speaker 2>with almost like nobles and retainers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted to use like a medieval </v>

595
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.680
<v Speaker 2>analogy rather than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than like,</v>

596
00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:27.250
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

597
00:28:27.251 --> 00:28:32.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're the lower classes and we are </v>

598
00:28:32.251 --> 00:28:32.320
<v Speaker 2>trying to overthrow you guys the upper </v>
<v Speaker 2>classes.</v>

599
00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:35.050
<v Speaker 2>But that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

600
00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.770
<v Speaker 2>during this era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right after,</v>

601
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.800
<v Speaker 2>after 1:46,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you do have a new class style of</v>

602
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:49.000
<v Speaker 2>politics that one of these rival clans </v>
<v Speaker 2>can take advantage of.</v>

603
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so hopefully I'm able to paint this </v>

604
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.190
<v Speaker 2>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what it is,</v>

605
00:28:54.191 --> 00:28:59.191
<v Speaker 2>is you have this ability to go out into </v>
<v Speaker 2>just the voting public,</v>

606
00:28:59.411 --> 00:29:01.240
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because all of these people could vote,</v>

607
00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:02.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rural peasants,</v>

608
00:29:02.681 --> 00:29:07.681
<v Speaker 2>the urban pubs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could all vote and you could use </v>

609
00:29:07.681 --> 00:29:10.171
<v Speaker 2>the popular assemblies to pass </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislation to make yourself and your </v>

610
00:29:10.171 --> 00:29:10.600
<v Speaker 2>own clan very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very popular.</v>

611
00:29:10.601 --> 00:29:15.601
<v Speaker 2>So this is almost something that like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would be sitting around with your </v>

612
00:29:15.601 --> 00:29:15.601
<v Speaker 2>senatorial family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

613
00:29:15.601 --> 00:29:17.590
<v Speaker 2>you're an ambitious senatorial family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

614
00:29:17.591 --> 00:29:19.700
<v Speaker 2>how are we going to get power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

615
00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:25.060
<v Speaker 2>of that appeal to the populace is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>available method of doing it.</v>

616
00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:30.570
<v Speaker 2>So you're ginning up class interests and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pointing them at often.</v>

617
00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Usually you're pointing it at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt Senate and saying like,</v>

618
00:29:33.791 --> 00:29:34.480
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

619
00:29:34.481 --> 00:29:38.590
<v Speaker 2>we are going to deliver to you what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt Senate has been denying you.</v>

620
00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:44.490
<v Speaker 2>But five years later or 10 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe your rival has decided to,</v>

621
00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.040
<v Speaker 2>to try to adopt one of these popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>platforms and use that.</v>

622
00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:53.041
<v Speaker 2>Well now you suddenly become the </v>
<v Speaker 2>defender of old senatorial interests </v>

623
00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:57.450
<v Speaker 2>because your rival was the one who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>now doing the popular program and so it </v>

624
00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:01.501
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a lot of like taking on and </v>

625
00:30:01.501 --> 00:30:01.501
<v Speaker 2>putting off of hats where you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>temporary,</v>

626
00:30:01.501 --> 00:30:05.770
<v Speaker 2>you might temporarily be the leader of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>popular movement and then 10 years later</v>

627
00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:08.320
<v Speaker 2>you might be standing in lock step with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Senate.</v>

628
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:09.770
<v Speaker 2>So it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

629
00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.750
<v Speaker 2>it was a lot more fluid I think than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

630
00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.650
<v Speaker 2>than anything that would be going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

631
00:30:14.651 --> 00:30:15.880
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

632
00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:17.320
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with battles between unions,</v>

633
00:30:17.321 --> 00:30:22.321
<v Speaker 2>battles between like socialist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalists in the modern era where </v>

634
00:30:22.321 --> 00:30:25.450
<v Speaker 2>there's really class interests involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you really had also like lower class</v>

635
00:30:25.451 --> 00:30:30.451
<v Speaker 2>leaders doing the leading in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you don't really get that in Roman</v>

636
00:30:30.881 --> 00:30:31.270
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

637
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.030
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was interesting because,</v>

638
00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:35.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had included in the book something,</v>

639
00:30:35.551 --> 00:30:37.410
<v Speaker 1>I think it was cato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elder had talked about,</v>

640
00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:42.880
<v Speaker 1>and we're getting back here to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the changes in Rome because of the </v>

641
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.131
<v Speaker 1>punic wars on the various conquest about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of wealth that was being </v>

642
00:30:46.131 --> 00:30:47.610
<v Speaker 1>dragged back to Rome by some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

643
00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of the people don't benefit</v>

644
00:30:49.321 --> 00:30:51.480
<v Speaker 1>from these conquests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of these commanders and whatnot</v>

645
00:30:51.481 --> 00:30:53.940
<v Speaker 1>would come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were talking about 40,000</v>

646
00:30:53.941 --> 00:30:57.750
<v Speaker 1>pounds of silver and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk a little about how,</v>

647
00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:02.900
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is such a Roman moralizer point of </v>

648
00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:02.900
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

649
00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:03.810
<v Speaker 1>About how the nouveau riche Romans or </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgetting their values,</v>

650
00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.570
<v Speaker 1>but you included it in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much did the,</v>

651
00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:10.770
<v Speaker 1>did the Roman system change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because all of a sudden it went from a,</v>

652
00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:11.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least the,</v>

653
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.400
<v Speaker 1>the portrayals of it make it sound like </v>
<v Speaker 1>more spartan,</v>

654
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:19.440
<v Speaker 1>more old values to cato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elder looking at the nice figs and </v>

655
00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.190
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carthage must be destroyed.</v>

656
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:25.390
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the role of this new wealth</v>

657
00:31:25.391 --> 00:31:30.391
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple of things that all of </v>

658
00:31:30.391 --> 00:31:30.391
<v Speaker 2>this new wealth does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

659
00:31:30.391 --> 00:31:31.060
<v Speaker 2>does bring into play,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

660
00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.760
<v Speaker 2>Like the Cato,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the elder style critique,</v>

661
00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:38.290
<v Speaker 2>which is that all of this wealth </v>
<v Speaker 2>degraded the morality of the upper class</v>

662
00:31:38.291 --> 00:31:43.291
<v Speaker 2>or degraded the morality of the Romans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is less important.</v>

663
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a huge driver of,</v>

664
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.420
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what the problem was.</v>

665
00:31:49.421 --> 00:31:51.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was that the wealth </v>
<v Speaker 2>degraded their morals.</v>

666
00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:57.440
<v Speaker 2>How do you think it was that it created </v>
<v Speaker 2>a skyrocketing economic inequality,</v>

667
00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:03.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where there had always been rich and </v>

668
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:03.150
<v Speaker 2>poor in Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

669
00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:03.150
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is going to be true.</v>

670
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:06.270
<v Speaker 2>Going all the way back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was happening is that as,</v>

671
00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:08.560
<v Speaker 2>as you just mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I read about this in the book,</v>

672
00:32:08.561 --> 00:32:11.020
<v Speaker 2>that you have these legions going out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there going out to Greece,</v>

673
00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:16.040
<v Speaker 2>Macedonia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to north Africa and </v>

674
00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:16.040
<v Speaker 2>they're bringing back 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>gold coins.</v>

675
00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.120
<v Speaker 2>They're bringing back 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds of raw silver.</v>

676
00:32:19.121 --> 00:32:24.121
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally like the Specie of the </v>

677
00:32:24.121 --> 00:32:27.271
<v Speaker 2>available specie of the Mediterranean is</v>
<v Speaker 2>being thrown into Roman wagons and </v>

678
00:32:27.271 --> 00:32:32.161
<v Speaker 2>hauled back to Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of which is being controlled mostly </v>

679
00:32:32.161 --> 00:32:35.640
<v Speaker 2>by that upper class senatorial elite or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

680
00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:37.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the richer equestrian classes,</v>

681
00:32:37.661 --> 00:32:40.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sort of the subset of the people who</v>

682
00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:45.521
<v Speaker 2>are one step below the senators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys are the ones who are </v>

683
00:32:45.521 --> 00:32:49.031
<v Speaker 2>controlling all of this wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do think that far from degrading </v>

684
00:32:49.031 --> 00:32:53.501
<v Speaker 2>the morality of the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does degrade the socioeconomic </v>

685
00:32:53.501 --> 00:32:53.660
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>

686
00:32:53.661 --> 00:32:55.010
<v Speaker 2>what are they going to do with all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>gold?</v>

687
00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:57.020
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Romans did not.</v>

688
00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:01.700
<v Speaker 2>They did not sit around counting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>counting their gold pieces like scrooge,</v>

689
00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

690
00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:02.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

691
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
<v Speaker 2>in a Christmas carol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to invest their gold into </v>

692
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.500
<v Speaker 2>things and most especially they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>invest it in land.</v>

693
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:13.700
<v Speaker 2>So their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their ability to now command this huge,</v>

694
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:18.730
<v Speaker 2>huge amount of wealth they're pouring it</v>
<v Speaker 2>into trying to buy up as much land as </v>

695
00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:23.141
<v Speaker 2>they possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this does lead to the further </v>

696
00:33:23.141 --> 00:33:24.170
<v Speaker 2>dispossession of all of those poor Roman</v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers,</v>

697
00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we talked about a couple of minutes</v>

698
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:31.480
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that there's that process that is an </v>

699
00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.640
<v Speaker 2>unfolding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that wealth being controlled by a few </v>

700
00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.071
<v Speaker 2>rich families is leading those rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>families to expand their own land </v>

701
00:33:36.071 --> 00:33:39.200
<v Speaker 2>holdings across Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's just gonna disrupt the entire</v>

702
00:33:39.201 --> 00:33:44.201
<v Speaker 2>socioeconomic system at that had been in</v>
<v Speaker 2>existence for hundreds of years.</v>

703
00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:48.440
<v Speaker 2>And that's just the one thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're investing all their money in.</v>

704
00:33:48.441 --> 00:33:53.441
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>investing all of their money in his </v>

705
00:33:53.441 --> 00:33:55.751
<v Speaker 2>slaves so they're now able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the richer Romans are now able to bring </v>

706
00:33:55.851 --> 00:33:59.150
<v Speaker 2>slaves into the system on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

707
00:33:59.151 --> 00:34:00.870
<v Speaker 2>an unprecedented scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

708
00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.930
<v Speaker 2>the Romans had always had slaves.</v>

709
00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:08.020
<v Speaker 2>Slaves had always been around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now you really have the slaves </v>

710
00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:11.500
<v Speaker 2>beginning to do most of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least commercial labor of this,</v>

711
00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.280
<v Speaker 2>of Roman society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're out there.</v>

712
00:34:13.281 --> 00:34:16.240
<v Speaker 2>They're picking the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing work in the fields.</v>

713
00:34:16.241 --> 00:34:16.950
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

714
00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:18.800
<v Speaker 2>they're doing the olives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>

715
00:34:18.801 --> 00:34:20.060
<v Speaker 2>if they're skilled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

716
00:34:20.061 --> 00:34:21.590
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you get captured and you're like,</v>

717
00:34:21.591 --> 00:34:22.070
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

718
00:34:22.071 --> 00:34:23.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make tables,</v>

719
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:29.550
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to be put to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>making tables for your owner or if </v>

720
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:32.390
<v Speaker 2>you're really unlucky you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>sent off to work in one of the mines and</v>

721
00:34:32.391 --> 00:34:37.391
<v Speaker 2>that's again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just going to be producing more </v>

722
00:34:37.391 --> 00:34:37.700
<v Speaker 2>and more wealth for the senatorial </v>
<v Speaker 2>aristocracy.</v>

723
00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:40.880
<v Speaker 2>So that combination of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of massive amounts of wealth,</v>

724
00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:45.910
<v Speaker 2>massive amounts of slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but always really to the benefit of a </v>

725
00:34:45.910 --> 00:34:49.190
<v Speaker 2>very small elite inside of Rome creates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>

726
00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:54.340
<v Speaker 2>the fundamentally destabilizing energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is going to allow some of these,</v>

727
00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:58.910
<v Speaker 2>of a genuine reformers all the way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cynical demagogues or all the way,</v>

728
00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:03.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately culminating with Julius </v>

729
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:03.970
<v Speaker 2>Caesar who is the pop laray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

730
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:08.300
<v Speaker 2>a reformer slash super ambitious noble </v>
<v Speaker 2>par excellence.</v>

731
00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:10.220
<v Speaker 2>It's all going to culminate with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

732
00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:15.220
<v Speaker 1>the slaves to me is the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>different variable when they do the </v>

733
00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:16.490
<v Speaker 1>comparisons between say the US now in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Roman republic.</v>

734
00:35:16.491 --> 00:35:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Because even if you wanted to argue </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

735
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:23.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slave labor being equivalent to low </v>

736
00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:23.700
<v Speaker 1>income labor from over the border or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

737
00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:24.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see the similarity,</v>

738
00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:27.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would be if you wanted to make an</v>

739
00:35:27.471 --> 00:35:30.220
<v Speaker 1>analogy with what the Romans did or what</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people's did in,</v>

740
00:35:30.221 --> 00:35:32.630
<v Speaker 1>in earlier history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be like we went into the Middle</v>

741
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:37.630
<v Speaker 1>East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toppled Saddam Hussein and brought </v>

742
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:37.630
<v Speaker 1>thousands of Iraqis back to the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States to serve us.</v>

743
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds like an inherently unstable </v>

744
00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:44.631
<v Speaker 1>situation to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found it interesting when you were </v>

745
00:35:44.631 --> 00:35:44.631
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

746
00:35:44.631 --> 00:35:49.130
<v Speaker 1>who had power in Rome and you talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about assemblies and that the average </v>

747
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:53.031
<v Speaker 1>Joe on the street had more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say both more and less power </v>

748
00:35:53.031 --> 00:35:56.901
<v Speaker 1>maybe then one thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're lying about being able to </v>

749
00:35:56.901 --> 00:35:56.901
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

750
00:35:56.901 --> 00:36:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in England they called it king </v>

751
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:00.530
<v Speaker 1>mob at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

752
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:03.510
<v Speaker 1>the ability to control the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart of Rome as,</v>

753
00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:05.830
<v Speaker 1>as the population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

754
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:08.370
<v Speaker 1>gave a certain amount of power in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

755
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:13.510
<v Speaker 1>It always amazed me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in that kind of a situation that </v>

756
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.740
<v Speaker 1>you never had a French revolution kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing when,</v>

757
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:18.950
<v Speaker 1>when it's so much a large percentage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the population being balanced out by </v>

758
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:22.881
<v Speaker 1>such a small class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's that client relationship that </v>

759
00:36:22.881 --> 00:36:23.760
<v Speaker 1>sort of weaves the threads of </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections,</v>

760
00:36:23.761 --> 00:36:26.310
<v Speaker 1>isn't it through the rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poor and the middle classes.</v>

761
00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:31.460
<v Speaker 1>And could you talk a minute about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equestrian class maybe and a connection </v>

762
00:36:31.741 --> 00:36:33.590
<v Speaker 1>to what today we would call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

763
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:35.220
<v Speaker 1>corporations and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

764
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.650
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that because the Roman </v>
<v Speaker 1>senators,</v>

765
00:36:37.651 --> 00:36:39.780
<v Speaker 1>we're not supposed to involve themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>in business.</v>

766
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:44.990
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of left a loophole for these </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people to come in and create what </v>

767
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.660
<v Speaker 1>I think today we would call </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations.</v>

768
00:36:45.661 --> 00:36:46.710
<v Speaker 1>You think that's a fair term?</v>

769
00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that they were corporations.</v>

770
00:36:49.191 --> 00:36:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

771
00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:54.800
<v Speaker 2>they were stock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would actually buy stock in these </v>

772
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:54.800
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

773
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:54.800
<v Speaker 2>So that's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

774
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in a,</v>

775
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.970
<v Speaker 2>in a rudimentary way that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

776
00:36:56.971 --> 00:37:01.971
<v Speaker 2>so there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this prohibition on the </v>

777
00:37:01.971 --> 00:37:05.661
<v Speaker 2>senators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like somebody who was in the Senate and </v>

778
00:37:05.661 --> 00:37:05.661
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

779
00:37:05.661 --> 00:37:08.930
<v Speaker 2>maybe 300,</v>
<v Speaker 2>350 men and their families are </v>

780
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:11.040
<v Speaker 2>prohibited from conducting commercial </v>
<v Speaker 2>transactions.</v>

781
00:37:11.041 --> 00:37:13.860
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the caveat to this is it,</v>

782
00:37:13.861 --> 00:37:15.810
<v Speaker 2>all of them did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all had,</v>

783
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.290
<v Speaker 2>they all had front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all had clients that they would use</v>

784
00:37:19.291 --> 00:37:19.860
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

785
00:37:19.861 --> 00:37:21.480
<v Speaker 2>this is my guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

786
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:22.920
<v Speaker 2>a Publius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

787
00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.770
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's somebody who just so happens to own</v>

788
00:37:25.771 --> 00:37:28.050
<v Speaker 2>a large amount of commercial real </v>
<v Speaker 2>estate.</v>

789
00:37:28.051 --> 00:37:29.610
<v Speaker 2>And I just happened to know him and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

790
00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.060
<v Speaker 2>it was all a front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

791
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.470
<v Speaker 2>so most senators were able to dodge this</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite easily,</v>

792
00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:39.890
<v Speaker 2>but the Roman state itself didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>perform any of their own logistical </v>

793
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.250
<v Speaker 2>enterprises.</v>

794
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:45.030
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even,</v>

795
00:37:45.031 --> 00:37:47.400
<v Speaker 2>right down to right down to tax </v>
<v Speaker 2>collection.</v>

796
00:37:47.401 --> 00:37:52.401
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Romans did not have state employees </v>

797
00:37:52.401 --> 00:37:55.491
<v Speaker 2>who were tax collectors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have state employees who </v>

798
00:37:55.491 --> 00:37:57.390
<v Speaker 2>made uniforms for the legions and ship </v>
<v Speaker 2>them off to the legions.</v>

799
00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was all done by groups of wealthy </v>

800
00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.670
<v Speaker 2>individuals who were not in the Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

801
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:07.320
<v Speaker 2>because we wanted to be able to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>around that,</v>

802
00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:08.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the commercial,</v>

803
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:13.600
<v Speaker 2>the commercial prohibitions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have these very wealthy families </v>

804
00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.960
<v Speaker 2>in Rome who are not a part of the Senate</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are actually the ones who were now </v>

805
00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:22.071
<v Speaker 2>handling the wealth of the society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the large scale transactions.</v>

806
00:38:22.681 --> 00:38:27.681
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they would do is they would come </v>

807
00:38:27.681 --> 00:38:27.681
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say that the tax collectors,</v>

808
00:38:27.681 --> 00:38:31.650
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want one of these tax farming </v>

809
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:31.650
<v Speaker 2>contracts and you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

810
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:35.070
<v Speaker 2>here's how much we're going to bid to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get this contract.</v>

811
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.620
<v Speaker 2>And then the sensor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once every five years would award,</v>

812
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.380
<v Speaker 2>would award a contract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And let's say your company won the bid,</v>

813
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:46.740
<v Speaker 2>then you would now have the right to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to some province or go to some area and </v>

814
00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:50.551
<v Speaker 2>be in charge of the tax collection where</v>
<v Speaker 2>any amount of money that you,</v>

815
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:56.430
<v Speaker 2>that you made out collecting taxes above</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you had bid was going to be your </v>

816
00:38:56.741 --> 00:38:58.020
<v Speaker 2>profit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

817
00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:03.840
<v Speaker 2>that model of extracting taxes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>provincials left itself open to like </v>

818
00:39:05.801 --> 00:39:09.140
<v Speaker 2>wild corruption and abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where if,</v>

819
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:13.270
<v Speaker 2>if your profit margin is simply however </v>
<v Speaker 2>much you can get out of these people,</v>

820
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

821
00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.810
<v Speaker 2>it's going to lead you to strong arm </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

822
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:20.620
<v Speaker 2>It's going to lead you to demand more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than they actually owed in taxes.</v>

823
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:25.570
<v Speaker 2>And the Roman government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Roman provincial administrations,</v>

824
00:39:25.571 --> 00:39:30.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean the people who would actually be </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there and near Spain or in further </v>

825
00:39:30.571 --> 00:39:32.530
<v Speaker 2>Spain actually representing the Roman </v>
<v Speaker 2>government as,</v>

826
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:33.820
<v Speaker 2>as like a state agent.</v>

827
00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:36.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're talking about less than </v>
<v Speaker 2>100 people.</v>

828
00:39:36.581 --> 00:39:39.850
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about the governor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his family,</v>

829
00:39:39.851 --> 00:39:41.770
<v Speaker 2>and maybe a couple other elected </v>
<v Speaker 2>officials.</v>

830
00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the face of Rome,</v>

831
00:39:43.901 --> 00:39:47.510
<v Speaker 2>how they're the people who were actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>running the province is,</v>

832
00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.560
<v Speaker 2>is these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

833
00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:51.460
<v Speaker 2>are these tax farmers with very little </v>
<v Speaker 2>oversight.</v>

834
00:39:51.461 --> 00:39:54.010
<v Speaker 2>And you could kind of like if you were a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tax form or you could go to a family and</v>

835
00:39:54.011 --> 00:39:54.490
<v Speaker 2>say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

836
00:39:54.491 --> 00:39:57.340
<v Speaker 2>you owe me this and taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The provincial pays the tax.</v>

837
00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:00.340
<v Speaker 2>Then you come back around six months </v>
<v Speaker 2>later and say,</v>

838
00:40:00.341 --> 00:40:01.660
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want me this tax again?</v>

839
00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:02.950
<v Speaker 2>And the family could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

840
00:40:02.951 --> 00:40:06.010
<v Speaker 2>we already paid that tax six months ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the tax farmer would just say,</v>

841
00:40:06.011 --> 00:40:08.110
<v Speaker 2>why I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pay me a.</v>

842
00:40:08.111 --> 00:40:10.510
<v Speaker 2>and there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no oversight to any of this,</v>

843
00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no real effective oversight anyway.</v>

844
00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:15.970
<v Speaker 2>And this creates the same kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

845
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:20.380
<v Speaker 2>really anger and resentment at a look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the Roman administrators,</v>

846
00:40:20.381 --> 00:40:23.530
<v Speaker 2>we're up to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amongst the provincials out out there in</v>

847
00:40:23.531 --> 00:40:25.310
<v Speaker 2>Spain or in Greece or later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

848
00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:27.970
<v Speaker 2>in Asia or what is today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>western Turkey.</v>

849
00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in and of itself lead to a </v>

850
00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:34.270
<v Speaker 2>destabilization of their imperial hold </v>
<v Speaker 2>on things.</v>

851
00:40:34.271 --> 00:40:39.271
<v Speaker 2>And that doesn't all get straightened </v>
<v Speaker 2>out really until augustus comes along </v>

852
00:40:39.271 --> 00:40:41.020
<v Speaker 2>and starts introducing a more stable </v>
<v Speaker 2>reforms.</v>

853
00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:43.840
<v Speaker 2>So fleeced by the contractors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

854
00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Very much so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very much so.</v>

855
00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:47.360
<v Speaker 1>So let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you,</v>

856
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:52.690
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a little bit of storytelling </v>

857
00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:52.690
<v Speaker 1>here because I think it's horrifying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

858
00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:56.660
<v Speaker 1>The first time I ever read anything in </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient history that reminded me of like</v>

859
00:40:56.661 --> 00:41:00.010
<v Speaker 1>George Orwell's 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>84 a.</v>

860
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:02.600
<v Speaker 1>and maybe this is just the way my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my brain connects things.</v>

861
00:41:02.601 --> 00:41:04.330
<v Speaker 1>But when you read about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

862
00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:06.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Marius and the seller arrows,</v>

863
00:41:06.801 --> 00:41:09.680
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when prescription lists are going up and</v>

864
00:41:09.681 --> 00:41:13.310
<v Speaker 1>people will read about whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're being sentenced to die,</v>

865
00:41:13.311 --> 00:41:18.311
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has such a third rice kind of </v>

866
00:41:18.311 --> 00:41:22.331
<v Speaker 1>Orwellian may be feel to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can go into that a little bit and </v>

867
00:41:22.331 --> 00:41:22.331
<v Speaker 1>talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

868
00:41:22.331 --> 00:41:27.310
<v Speaker 1>talk about how different that was for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rome to wake up and go see if you were </v>

869
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:28.340
<v Speaker 1>on the list to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

870
00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.960
<v Speaker 2>at the beginning of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

871
00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:36.020
<v Speaker 2>we're at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's between various political </v>

872
00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:37.100
<v Speaker 2>rivals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>various political groups,</v>

873
00:41:37.101 --> 00:41:42.101
<v Speaker 2>various families,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they start maneuvering around each </v>

874
00:41:42.101 --> 00:41:44.020
<v Speaker 2>other and they start breaking down these</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules of most of them.</v>

875
00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:45.710
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but kind of in the early days,</v>

876
00:41:45.711 --> 00:41:48.020
<v Speaker 2>it's all very ad hoc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all very spontaneous,</v>

877
00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:53.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's really more about like </v>

878
00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:54.410
<v Speaker 2>maneuvering in new ways that hadn't been</v>
<v Speaker 2>done before.</v>

879
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:56.690
<v Speaker 2>You start plotting along through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

880
00:41:56.691 --> 00:41:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to chapter eight,</v>

881
00:41:57.861 --> 00:42:02.861
<v Speaker 2>you get to chapter nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're talking about these groups </v>

882
00:42:02.861 --> 00:42:04.460
<v Speaker 2>having a armed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like on retainer,</v>

883
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:07.070
<v Speaker 2>armed gangs who are going to fight for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

884
00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:12.640
<v Speaker 2>And by the very end of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes necessary to not just defeat </v>

885
00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.560
<v Speaker 2>your rivals and have them say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

886
00:42:15.561 --> 00:42:16.070
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

887
00:42:16.071 --> 00:42:18.080
<v Speaker 2>I lost that vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I lost that console ship.</v>

888
00:42:18.081 --> 00:42:20.150
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'll go home now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

889
00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:25.740
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're operating in a civil war </v>

890
00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:26.350
<v Speaker 2>environment where it's no longer enough </v>
<v Speaker 2>to just beat your rivals.</v>

891
00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:28.310
<v Speaker 2>You have to kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to kill them.</v>

892
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:33.490
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't kill them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they're going to come back and </v>

893
00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:33.490
<v Speaker 2>they're going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

894
00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:38.470
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a little tight cycle of this </v>

895
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.470
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

896
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:42.330
<v Speaker 2>when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do too much in the way </v>

897
00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:42.330
<v Speaker 2>of spoilers if you haven't read the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

898
00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:42.330
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

899
00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:45.821
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we kind of all know it all ends badly </v>

900
00:42:45.821 --> 00:42:45.821
<v Speaker 2>for the Romans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not too much of a spoiler to say</v>

901
00:42:45.821 --> 00:42:47.230
<v Speaker 2>it ends badly for most of these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

902
00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:52.720
<v Speaker 2>but the seller goes off to the east,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

903
00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:55.430
<v Speaker 2>to fight his battle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight his war against Mithra Daddy's.</v>

904
00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:59.120
<v Speaker 2>He's had this very intense struggle with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maurice and Maurice,</v>

905
00:42:59.121 --> 00:43:03.270
<v Speaker 2>his allies and Maurice and his allies </v>
<v Speaker 2>wind up coming into Rome.</v>

906
00:43:03.271 --> 00:43:08.271
<v Speaker 2>And recapturing Rome having been booted </v>
<v Speaker 2>out a couple of weeks earlier and they </v>

907
00:43:08.271 --> 00:43:10.520
<v Speaker 2>start killing the allies of Sela.</v>

908
00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:16.300
<v Speaker 2>This leads when seller comes back a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple years later for solid to </v>

909
00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:20.100
<v Speaker 2>reciprocate to give as good as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And starting.</v>

910
00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.610
<v Speaker 2>You get literally putting up named </v>
<v Speaker 2>lists,</v>

911
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a list of names.</v>

912
00:43:23.811 --> 00:43:26.180
<v Speaker 2>And if you kill one of these people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring me their head,</v>

913
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:28.640
<v Speaker 2>then I will pay you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will pay you money.</v>

914
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:33.510
<v Speaker 2>And what is kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it also not just Orwellian,</v>

915
00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.480
<v Speaker 2>but also like very Kafka ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

916
00:43:35.481 --> 00:43:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Where it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all becomes very arbitrary.</v>

917
00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the whole,</v>

918
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:43.640
<v Speaker 2>the whole original point of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>prescription list was so that the people</v>

919
00:43:43.641 --> 00:43:45.710
<v Speaker 2>who sell low was not planning on </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing.</v>

920
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Could rest easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

921
00:43:47.271 --> 00:43:47.630
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

922
00:43:47.631 --> 00:43:50.690
<v Speaker 2>well my name's not on the list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll be fine.</v>

923
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:54.320
<v Speaker 2>But every day a new list goes up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>new names on it.</v>

924
00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:57.740
<v Speaker 2>And you start having names being added </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the list.</v>

925
00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:03.400
<v Speaker 2>Not because they are enemies of Sela but</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they happen to be enemies of </v>

926
00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.590
<v Speaker 2>maybe one of cellos our allies or in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>case of crisis.</v>

927
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:08.900
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is like,</v>

928
00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:14.140
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you own a very rich estate down here in </v>

929
00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:16.901
<v Speaker 2>Campania,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I would actually like to own </v>

930
00:44:16.901 --> 00:44:16.901
<v Speaker 2>that estate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think I'm going to declare you an,</v>

931
00:44:16.901 --> 00:44:18.950
<v Speaker 2>an and an enemy of Sela and have you </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed.</v>

932
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:22.180
<v Speaker 2>So those prescriptions that sort of eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>up the last,</v>

933
00:44:22.181 --> 00:44:27.181
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last few chapters of the book are </v>

934
00:44:27.181 --> 00:44:29.591
<v Speaker 2>all very bloody and they become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes on an absurd level where it </v>

935
00:44:30.321 --> 00:44:32.820
<v Speaker 2>doesn't even matter whether you're an </v>
<v Speaker 2>enemy of somebody.</v>

936
00:44:32.821 --> 00:44:37.821
<v Speaker 2>And there's a quote from some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from some rich equestrian who gets </v>

937
00:44:37.821 --> 00:44:38.420
<v Speaker 2>killed in east,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

938
00:44:38.421 --> 00:44:41.370
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>done for because of my Alban farm.</v>

939
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:42.480
<v Speaker 2>And then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets,</v>

940
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:44.430
<v Speaker 2>he gets killed in his farm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets confiscated.</v>

941
00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:49.431
<v Speaker 2>So it moves very quickly from I have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill my enemies in order to triumph,</v>

942
00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.780
<v Speaker 2>to just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just kill everybody and confiscate</v>

943
00:44:51.781 --> 00:44:52.320
<v Speaker 2>their stuff.</v>

944
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:57.680
<v Speaker 1>And it's a wanted dead or alive kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach to getting the enemy's isn't it</v>

945
00:44:57.681 --> 00:44:58.600
<v Speaker 1>sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

946
00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:00.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring us back the head and we'll pay,</v>

947
00:45:00.711 --> 00:45:05.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit different than sending out </v>

948
00:45:05.711 --> 00:45:05.711
<v Speaker 1>your own Gestapo.</v>

949
00:45:05.711 --> 00:45:07.480
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you actually started having,</v>

950
00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:10.760
<v Speaker 2>it became a fairly lucrative profession </v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

951
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:15.800
<v Speaker 2>for a couple months and even then for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple years where you would go out and </v>

952
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:15.800
<v Speaker 2>you would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

953
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:16.310
<v Speaker 2>well let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

954
00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:18.250
<v Speaker 2>we'll almost like bounty hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

955
00:45:18.251 --> 00:45:19.450
<v Speaker 2>We'll go through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just going to say that.</v>

956
00:45:19.451 --> 00:45:20.710
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

957
00:45:20.711 --> 00:45:22.930
<v Speaker 2>And we'll kill them in and then we'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>get their stuff.</v>

958
00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:24.070
<v Speaker 2>And what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

959
00:45:24.071 --> 00:45:29.071
<v Speaker 2>and I also do mention this in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there does come a point where they </v>

960
00:45:29.071 --> 00:45:29.740
<v Speaker 2>start to realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

961
00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:31.660
<v Speaker 2>they don't realize the way that we do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's,</v>

962
00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:34.840
<v Speaker 2>there are no photographs of anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are no pictures of anybody.</v>

963
00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:40.440
<v Speaker 2>They don't live in a digital age where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a seller can hold up a picture </v>

964
00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.020
<v Speaker 2>and then hold up the head and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

965
00:45:41.021 --> 00:45:46.021
<v Speaker 2>you got the right guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you start having them just grab </v>

966
00:45:46.021 --> 00:45:46.021
<v Speaker 2>random dude off the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill them,</v>

967
00:45:46.021 --> 00:45:47.380
<v Speaker 2>chop their head off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take it in and say,</v>

968
00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:48.550
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a.</v>

969
00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.080
<v Speaker 2>and then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of scanning the list.</v>

970
00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:50.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is this guy.</v>

971
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.850
<v Speaker 2>It's guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

972
00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:52.420
<v Speaker 2>berries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

973
00:45:52.421 --> 00:45:52.840
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

974
00:45:52.841 --> 00:45:53.950
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is his head,</v>

975
00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.600
<v Speaker 2>and then you would get your bounty.</v>

976
00:45:56.770 --> 00:45:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little like this black scout that</v>

977
00:45:58.981 --> 00:46:01.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving you a black hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an Apache scalp.</v>

978
00:46:01.201 --> 00:46:02.260
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

979
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:04.460
<v Speaker 2>250 gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>

980
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:06.270
<v Speaker 2>it's all very twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>

981
00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:09.270
<v Speaker 2>it's all very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all quite statistic to be honest.</v>

982
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Something that comes to my mind and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly don't know the answer and the </v>

983
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.700
<v Speaker 1>period we're talking about here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

984
00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:19.730
<v Speaker 1>but discussing the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attempts by what we would call </v>

985
00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:23.841
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign powers are foreign entities to </v>

986
00:46:23.841 --> 00:46:25.380
<v Speaker 1>influence the politics of a vibrant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it,</v>

987
00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:28.210
<v Speaker 1>on the way to corrupt republic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

988
00:46:28.211 --> 00:46:33.211
<v Speaker 1>I just finished a show we did on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Caesar's conquest of Gol and it's </v>

989
00:46:33.211 --> 00:46:33.510
<v Speaker 1>interesting how the more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

990
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:35.960
<v Speaker 1>shall we call them civilized or more </v>
<v Speaker 1>romanesque.</v>

991
00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Golic tribes were basically trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence the politics in Rome during </v>

992
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:45.381
<v Speaker 1>the period you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there outside forces from other </v>

993
00:46:45.381 --> 00:46:48.801
<v Speaker 1>states trying to push their agenda or </v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view or the direction they'd </v>

994
00:46:48.801 --> 00:46:51.040
<v Speaker 1>like to see Rome a move towards?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

995
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.830
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were any of the outside entities in,</v>

996
00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:58.840
<v Speaker 1>in the geopolitical world of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mediterranean at that time trying to </v>

997
00:46:58.840 --> 00:46:58.920
<v Speaker 1>influence Roman politics?</v>

998
00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:05.360
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this had been true for quite some </v>

999
00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:05.360
<v Speaker 2>time where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1000
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.040
<v Speaker 2>going back even before the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the book,</v>

1001
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:11.910
<v Speaker 2>after Rome defeats Hannibal in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second punic war,</v>

1002
00:47:11.911 --> 00:47:16.911
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a good like 50 or 60 year </v>

1003
00:47:16.911 --> 00:47:18.180
<v Speaker 2>period where Rome was the most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>state in the Mediterranean,</v>

1004
00:47:18.181 --> 00:47:23.181
<v Speaker 2>but not quite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't quite decided they wanted to </v>

1005
00:47:23.181 --> 00:47:25.911
<v Speaker 2>annex and rule the Mediterranean </v>
<v Speaker 2>directly where they almost set </v>

1006
00:47:25.911 --> 00:47:29.601
<v Speaker 2>themselves up as kind of an arbitrator </v>
<v Speaker 2>of last resort for various city and </v>

1007
00:47:29.601 --> 00:47:31.780
<v Speaker 2>kingdoms out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would have like a couple of Greek</v>

1008
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:36.990
<v Speaker 2>cities who were in having some border </v>
<v Speaker 2>dispute or having some like fishing </v>

1009
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:40.531
<v Speaker 2>rights dispute and they would agree to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take their case to Rome and anytime </v>

1010
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:41.380
<v Speaker 2>these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1011
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:46.390
<v Speaker 2>so Rome became like a hub of </v>
<v Speaker 2>international embassies and ambassadors </v>

1012
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:50.521
<v Speaker 2>and people constantly envoys coming and </v>
<v Speaker 2>going from really as far away as Syria </v>

1013
00:47:50.521 --> 00:47:55.351
<v Speaker 2>and Egypt and all of them are bringing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with them gifts that could only be </v>

1014
00:47:56.111 --> 00:47:57.190
<v Speaker 2>described as bribes.</v>

1015
00:47:57.490 --> 00:48:02.490
<v Speaker 2>Where you are definitely going to try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get what you want from the Senate by </v>

1016
00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:06.910
<v Speaker 2>making sure that the right senators have</v>
<v Speaker 2>received the right gifts and that that's</v>

1017
00:48:06.911 --> 00:48:09.010
<v Speaker 2>something that had really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was again,</v>

1018
00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:14.011
<v Speaker 2>something that had opened up and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and does get to a more corrupt version </v>

1019
00:48:14.011 --> 00:48:17.410
<v Speaker 2>of the senate than had existed before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the context of,</v>

1020
00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:22.770
<v Speaker 2>of my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great example of this in my book is </v>

1021
00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:26.760
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] conduct in new media where </v>
<v Speaker 2>he is one of the kings of new media </v>

1022
00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:28.170
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1023
00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:33.240
<v Speaker 2>after his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess adopted father dies along with </v>

1024
00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:36.061
<v Speaker 2>his two brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but [inaudible] would prefer to be the </v>

1025
00:48:36.061 --> 00:48:37.120
<v Speaker 2>sole king of new media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he starts breaking treaties.</v>

1026
00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:42.420
<v Speaker 2>P starts killing his brothers and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants the Senate to just go along with </v>

1027
00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:47.401
<v Speaker 2>what he's doing down there rather than </v>
<v Speaker 2>sending in legions or trying to stop </v>

1028
00:48:47.401 --> 00:48:50.911
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he absolutely quite brazenly and </v>

1029
00:48:50.911 --> 00:48:52.240
<v Speaker 2>quite nakedly is and voice to the Roman </v>
<v Speaker 2>Senate,</v>

1030
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:57.270
<v Speaker 2>laden with gold and laden with gifts and</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to influence the Senate's </v>

1031
00:48:57.701 --> 00:48:58.270
<v Speaker 2>conduct.</v>

1032
00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:00.060
<v Speaker 2>And he's quite successful at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1033
00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:05.100
<v Speaker 2>for most of the first seven or eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>years of [inaudible] reign,</v>

1034
00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:10.660
<v Speaker 2>he's definitely able to have more or </v>
<v Speaker 2>less paid friends in the Senate,</v>

1035
00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:15.840
<v Speaker 2>direct the senate away from the notion </v>
<v Speaker 2>of ever sending the legions in to </v>

1036
00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:16.580
<v Speaker 2>confront Jakartha and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>

1037
00:49:16.581 --> 00:49:19.060
<v Speaker 2>it gets quite bad where you do have </v>
<v Speaker 2>these senators.</v>

1038
00:49:19.061 --> 00:49:19.870
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my God,</v>

1039
00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:25.110
<v Speaker 2>this is so brazen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like where we might actually have to do </v>

1040
00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:25.110
<v Speaker 2>something about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're making us all look bad,</v>

1041
00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:26.260
<v Speaker 2>is there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're sort of chastising,</v>

1042
00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:27.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

1043
00:49:27.131 --> 00:49:30.040
<v Speaker 2>their colleagues in the Senate who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>accepting all of [inaudible] money.</v>

1044
00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:32.860
<v Speaker 2>And that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1045
00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:36.820
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the corruption of the Senate by as money</v>

1046
00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:40.660
<v Speaker 2>does become a flash point in Roman </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>

1047
00:49:40.661 --> 00:49:41.230
<v Speaker 2>Where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1048
00:49:41.231 --> 00:49:46.231
<v Speaker 2>if you go back to some of these popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>are energies that had been sort of </v>

1049
00:49:46.231 --> 00:49:47.680
<v Speaker 2>started this had started fomenting that.</v>

1050
00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.630
<v Speaker 2>They're saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1051
00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:53.920
<v Speaker 2>Jakartha is brazenly flouting a Roman </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority and Roman law.</v>

1052
00:49:53.921 --> 00:49:58.921
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or we're telling him to do things and </v>

1053
00:49:58.921 --> 00:49:58.921
<v Speaker 2>he's ignoring us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's killing Italians.</v>

1054
00:49:58.921 --> 00:50:02.170
<v Speaker 2>He's killing Roman citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet we continue to do nothing.</v>

1055
00:50:02.171 --> 00:50:05.680
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's because Jakartha has bribed his</v>

1056
00:50:05.681 --> 00:50:08.710
<v Speaker 2>way into the Senate and so they actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>open up,</v>

1057
00:50:08.711 --> 00:50:11.170
<v Speaker 2>they're actually able to open up as sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like a quasi,</v>

1058
00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a special tribunal that is going to</v>

1059
00:50:13.871 --> 00:50:18.871
<v Speaker 2>start to investigate and prosecute those</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Senate who were guilty of being </v>

1060
00:50:18.871 --> 00:50:23.701
<v Speaker 2>corrupted by Jakartha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which gets me to a question of tipping </v>

1061
00:50:23.701 --> 00:50:28.430
<v Speaker 2>points and points of no return when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the,</v>

1062
00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:29.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

1063
00:50:29.161 --> 00:50:34.161
<v Speaker 1>when people like to look for examples </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the past to try to analyze our own </v>

1064
00:50:34.161 --> 00:50:35.990
<v Speaker 1>times and you do quite a bit of that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the book and I love it.</v>

1065
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:41.800
<v Speaker 1>But when you look at our situation now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the people who founded this country </v>

1066
00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:42.480
<v Speaker 1>and who wrote the documents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1067
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:47.510
<v Speaker 1>that form our framework,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're keen students of the Roman </v>

1068
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:49.520
<v Speaker 1>republic obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they were paying attention to the</v>

1069
00:50:49.521 --> 00:50:52.580
<v Speaker 1>flaws in their system and how things </v>
<v Speaker 1>went wrong and try to make,</v>

1070
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:57.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make changes in their own version </v>

1071
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:59.801
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that we wouldn't fall down the same </v>

1072
00:50:59.801 --> 00:51:02.621
<v Speaker 1>rat hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when do you think it was </v>

1073
00:51:02.621 --> 00:51:02.621
<v Speaker 1>irreversible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

1074
00:51:02.621 --> 00:51:04.970
<v Speaker 1>when do you think the death spiral had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been reached?</v>

1075
00:51:04.971 --> 00:51:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Where you can imagine now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1076
00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:07.700
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

1077
00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:08.510
<v Speaker 1>were the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1078
00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:11.520
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the points of entry and the,</v>

1079
00:51:11.521 --> 00:51:14.450
<v Speaker 1>the ability to compromise it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just gone to farming.</v>

1080
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Is it when the violence first breaks out</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it after that or is it before </v>

1081
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:19.630
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you,</v>

1082
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:22.940
<v Speaker 1>if you had to find a tipping point when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the iceberg struck the titanic,</v>

1083
00:51:22.941 --> 00:51:25.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a better way to put it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where is it in your mind?</v>

1084
00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:28.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll answer that in a sec.</v>

1085
00:51:28.611 --> 00:51:30.370
<v Speaker 2>I will say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1086
00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons we know so much about</v>

1087
00:51:32.481 --> 00:51:37.481
<v Speaker 2>everything I just said about Jakartha is</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the Roman historian Salus </v>

1088
00:51:37.481 --> 00:51:42.400
<v Speaker 2>elected to write about the jigger war </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Bertha's corruption of the Senate </v>

1089
00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:47.141
<v Speaker 2>and the battles that ensued a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Saul was to somebody who was </v>

1090
00:51:47.141 --> 00:51:47.160
<v Speaker 2>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1091
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:49.320
<v Speaker 2>he was a partisan of Julius Caesar's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1092
00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:53.090
<v Speaker 2>so he's writing his books right around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the forties and thirties BC.</v>

1093
00:51:53.091 --> 00:51:58.091
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows how it all turns out and he's </v>

1094
00:51:58.091 --> 00:51:58.091
<v Speaker 2>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1095
00:51:58.091 --> 00:51:59.060
<v Speaker 2>fairly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fairly contemporaneously with events.</v>

1096
00:51:59.061 --> 00:52:04.061
<v Speaker 2>And he wrote about the [inaudible] war </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically because he said that was </v>

1097
00:52:04.061 --> 00:52:04.470
<v Speaker 2>the tipping point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1098
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.970
<v Speaker 2>That was when he said that was the first</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment that laying on like the old,</v>

1099
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:13.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the corruption of the Senate was first </v>

1100
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:15.221
<v Speaker 2>challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what led to what became these </v>

1101
00:52:15.221 --> 00:52:16.400
<v Speaker 2>partisan battles that ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroyed the senate.</v>

1102
00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:21.400
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he actually identified the jigger thien </v>

1103
00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:21.400
<v Speaker 2>war as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

1104
00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.130
<v Speaker 2>as that tipping point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why he wrote about it.</v>

1105
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could the senate had,</v>

1106
00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:25.700
<v Speaker 2>or could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>

1107
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:29.090
<v Speaker 2>could the Roman republic have pulled out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it at that point?</v>

1108
00:52:29.091 --> 00:52:34.091
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so the point that I come to is,</v>

1109
00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.440
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

1110
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:39.620
<v Speaker 2>it's solace conduct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1111
00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.660
<v Speaker 2>at the very end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1112
00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:43.460
<v Speaker 2>what becomes the end of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but solids conduct,</v>

1113
00:52:43.770 --> 00:52:48.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during some of his final showdown is </v>

1114
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:51.461
<v Speaker 2>really what sets the final permanent </v>
<v Speaker 2>blueprint for how you can achieve power </v>

1115
00:52:53.961 --> 00:52:58.040
<v Speaker 2>by completely disregarding just anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>but brute force.</v>

1116
00:52:58.041 --> 00:53:00.050
<v Speaker 2>So Sala is going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1117
00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.880
<v Speaker 2>he loses a political confrontation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Louisa,</v>

1118
00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:05.280
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had command of this eastern army.</v>

1119
00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:11.700
<v Speaker 2>He Marius uses the power of the assembly</v>
<v Speaker 2>to strip sela of his command and send </v>

1120
00:53:12.651 --> 00:53:17.651
<v Speaker 2>Sela away what Martez thinks he's sent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a packing for good and sell really is</v>

1121
00:53:17.841 --> 00:53:21.500
<v Speaker 2>faced with this choice of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I accept this defeat?</v>

1122
00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:26.500
<v Speaker 2>Do I get stripped of my command?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I accept the humiliation that I have </v>

1123
00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:27.750
<v Speaker 2>just endured at the hands of my rival </v>
<v Speaker 2>Maurice?</v>

1124
00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:33.110
<v Speaker 2>Or do I go back to my five legions who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are loyal to me personally and do I </v>

1125
00:53:33.601 --> 00:53:38.601
<v Speaker 2>point them at Rome and March on Rome to </v>
<v Speaker 2>a victorious from Rome and reclaim what </v>

1126
00:53:39.031 --> 00:53:44.031
<v Speaker 2>I think is rightfully mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once one solid did that and then </v>

1127
00:53:45.061 --> 00:53:47.850
<v Speaker 2>ultimately he emerges victorious from </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1128
00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:54.410
<v Speaker 2>That is the point that men like Julius </v>
<v Speaker 2>Caesar and men like pompey a WHO's an </v>

1129
00:53:55.351 --> 00:53:59.970
<v Speaker 2>early partisan of sellers are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be looking at later on down the road and</v>

1130
00:53:59.971 --> 00:54:00.540
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1131
00:54:00.541 --> 00:54:01.520
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if nothing else,</v>

1132
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:02.760
<v Speaker 2>I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1133
00:54:02.761 --> 00:54:05.100
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have any,</v>

1134
00:54:05.101 --> 00:54:08.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think like exact quotes or proof</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1135
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:09.120
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

1136
00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.440
<v Speaker 2>in the historical record that Julius </v>
<v Speaker 2>Caesar was,</v>

1137
00:54:11.441 --> 00:54:14.520
<v Speaker 2>was actively thinking about seller when </v>
<v Speaker 2>he crossed the Rubicon.</v>

1138
00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:20.060
<v Speaker 2>But it had to have been on his mind and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the proof was in the pudding for solace </v>

1139
00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:21.660
<v Speaker 2>conduct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get a large army,</v>

1140
00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:26.900
<v Speaker 2>keep them loyal to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can use them to prosecute your own </v>

1141
00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.991
<v Speaker 2>domestic political enemies and emerge </v>
<v Speaker 2>victorious and become a dictator for </v>

1142
00:54:29.991 --> 00:54:31.010
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1143
00:54:31.011 --> 00:54:33.900
<v Speaker 2>I sort of put it there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that Cellos,</v>

1144
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:36.480
<v Speaker 2>cellos decisions in those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in those moments,</v>

1145
00:54:36.481 --> 00:54:38.610
<v Speaker 2>in the early days of the civil wars is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really what,</v>

1146
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:40.920
<v Speaker 2>what made it so that the republic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was no,</v>

1147
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:42.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like there was any coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>back from that.</v>

1148
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:45.120
<v Speaker 1>You had mentioned when Kayas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caracas was,</v>

1149
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:49.200
<v Speaker 1>was looking at his broad range of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reforms you had talked about,</v>

1150
00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:50.640
<v Speaker 1>had they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going from memory here,</v>

1151
00:54:50.641 --> 00:54:55.641
<v Speaker 1>but you'd said if they had been enacted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have foreseen a lot of the </v>

1152
00:54:55.641 --> 00:54:59.721
<v Speaker 1>changes that Augustus era Roman reforms </v>
<v Speaker 1>had implemented and obviously a long </v>

1153
00:55:01.861 --> 00:55:04.890
<v Speaker 1>time ahead of time if something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had gone forward.</v>

1154
00:55:04.891 --> 00:55:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Is that the example of a reform moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had to come to pass,</v>

1155
00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:12.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inevitable death spiral that </v>

1156
00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:12.980
<v Speaker 1>happened might have been avoided?</v>

1157
00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:14.600
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's because they're,</v>

1158
00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:19.610
<v Speaker 2>there would not have been quite the </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy or the impetus to,</v>

1159
00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:23.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to just crack the state in half,</v>

1160
00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.170
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

1161
00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:29.910
<v Speaker 2>you get to a point where if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>governing apparatus or whatever it </v>

1162
00:55:29.971 --> 00:55:33.000
<v Speaker 2>happens to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if enough people start to feel like that</v>

1163
00:55:33.001 --> 00:55:35.460
<v Speaker 2>governing apparatus is not working for </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1164
00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.770
<v Speaker 2>it's not doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me personally,</v>

1165
00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:41.310
<v Speaker 2>why do I owe it as an institution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of loyalty,</v>

1166
00:55:41.311 --> 00:55:46.050
<v Speaker 2>my loyalty ought to go to the thing or </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the people or in the Roman case,</v>

1167
00:55:46.051 --> 00:55:51.051
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes to the general who's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be guaranteeing me the kind of security </v>

1168
00:55:51.051 --> 00:55:53.520
<v Speaker 2>that I want in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I want a plot of land.</v>

1169
00:55:53.521 --> 00:55:56.100
<v Speaker 2>I want decent wages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want a,</v>

1170
00:55:56.101 --> 00:55:57.900
<v Speaker 2>I want someplace to be able to settle </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1171
00:55:57.901 --> 00:56:02.901
<v Speaker 2>retire when I'm done here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time you get to the later </v>

1172
00:56:02.901 --> 00:56:05.030
<v Speaker 2>republic that is providable by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by warlords,</v>

1173
00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:05.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1174
00:56:05.941 --> 00:56:10.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could absolutely describe Caesar as </v>

1175
00:56:10.941 --> 00:56:10.941
<v Speaker 2>a warlord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1176
00:56:10.941 --> 00:56:14.720
<v Speaker 2>once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once it starts to become those guys who </v>

1177
00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:17.361
<v Speaker 2>are delivering on the promises that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are being made rather than the </v>

1178
00:56:17.361 --> 00:56:18.090
<v Speaker 2>state itself.</v>

1179
00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:19.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1180
00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:23.620
<v Speaker 2>what is it that they had to be loyal to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Senate and people of Rome abstractly</v>

1181
00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:24.540
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1182
00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:29.880
<v Speaker 2>so when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get to these moments when you </v>

1183
00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:32.881
<v Speaker 2>can make some of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you can have a little bit of </v>

1184
00:56:32.881 --> 00:56:33.630
<v Speaker 2>foresight and say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or is this model working for,</v>

1185
00:56:33.631 --> 00:56:37.570
<v Speaker 2>for the entire citizen population?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is it just working for a tiny elite,</v>

1186
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:42.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you start ignoring the rest of the </v>

1187
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:42.990
<v Speaker 2>citizens and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1188
00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:43.480
<v Speaker 2>it's working for a tiny elite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's fine.</v>

1189
00:56:43.481 --> 00:56:47.770
<v Speaker 2>They'll just accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do create a breach of legitimacy and</v>

1190
00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:50.890
<v Speaker 2>you do a alienate people to the point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're not.</v>

1191
00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.320
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're no longer loyal to the system at</v>

1192
00:56:53.321 --> 00:56:58.321
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how you get people just </v>

1193
00:56:58.321 --> 00:56:58.321
<v Speaker 2>crashing it over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1194
00:56:58.321 --> 00:56:59.440
<v Speaker 2>and most people practically not even </v>
<v Speaker 2>caring.</v>

1195
00:56:59.820 --> 00:57:00.300
<v Speaker 2>And you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1196
00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:03.040
<v Speaker 2>The private military thing which used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be illegal in Rome.</v>

1197
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.360
<v Speaker 2>Why did the Romans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

1198
00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:09.400
<v Speaker 2>why did the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the citizenry or the Senate put up with </v>

1199
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:09.400
<v Speaker 2>the change that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1200
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:13.891
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to put the major thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the founding fathers of the United </v>

1201
00:57:13.891 --> 00:57:17.370
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course tried to do was to make sure </v>

1202
00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:17.370
<v Speaker 2>that the citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1203
00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:19.150
<v Speaker 2>leadership controlled the military so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we had that separation,</v>

1204
00:57:19.151 --> 00:57:24.151
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they kind of had that separation in </v>

1205
00:57:24.151 --> 00:57:24.151
<v Speaker 2>Rome once upon a time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What made,</v>

1206
00:57:24.151 --> 00:57:25.210
<v Speaker 2>and we'll make this the last question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what made the,</v>

1207
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:27.610
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the circumstances or,</v>

1208
00:57:27.611 --> 00:57:30.290
<v Speaker 2>or public opinion or senatorial opinion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1209
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:33.280
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the word might be put up.</v>

1210
00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Why did they put up with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The raising of private armies?</v>

1211
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:42.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why they put up with it </v>

1212
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:45.060
<v Speaker 2>initially was because Rome was facing an</v>
<v Speaker 2>emergency military situation,</v>

1213
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:50.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they were sort of simultaneously </v>

1214
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:53.730
<v Speaker 2>around the age of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around Maria because Maria is sort of </v>

1215
00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:53.730
<v Speaker 2>the great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1216
00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:58.051
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had been moving in this direction of </v>

1217
00:57:58.051 --> 00:58:00.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a backup in case people don't know </v>

1218
00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:00.500
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1219
00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:00.500
<v Speaker 2>previously to serve in the legions.</v>

1220
00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:02.050
<v Speaker 2>You had to own a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>property.</v>

1221
00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:05.260
<v Speaker 2>You actually had to literally be rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to serve in the legions.</v>

1222
00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:08.590
<v Speaker 2>And by the middle of of the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by in the middle of the storm,</v>

1223
00:58:08.591 --> 00:58:13.591
<v Speaker 2>before the storm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get Marius making this fateful </v>

1224
00:58:13.591 --> 00:58:16.920
<v Speaker 2>request for an exemption from that </v>
<v Speaker 2>requirement and just let me enroll any </v>

1225
00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.980
<v Speaker 2>warm body who wants to show up and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>train them and I'll teach them how to be</v>

1226
00:58:20.981 --> 00:58:22.350
<v Speaker 2>soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was.</v>

1227
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:27.390
<v Speaker 2>That was a fairly momentous change in in</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the Romans conducted politics and </v>

1228
00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:32.371
<v Speaker 2>war and does have a lot to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people who are now going to be </v>

1229
00:58:32.711 --> 00:58:37.711
<v Speaker 2>loyal more to their general than to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state because it's the general who's </v>

1230
00:58:37.711 --> 00:58:41.940
<v Speaker 2>going to be providing them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>guaranteeing them a the riches and land </v>

1231
00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:43.060
<v Speaker 2>that they hope to get out of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>service.</v>

1232
00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:46.450
<v Speaker 2>So the reason why I think in that moment</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the Senate says,</v>

1233
00:58:46.451 --> 00:58:47.170
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah you can,</v>

1234
00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:49.800
<v Speaker 2>you can draft anybody is that they had.</v>

1235
00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:54.830
<v Speaker 2>They had an ongoing war in north Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a huge slave rebellion that </v>

1236
00:58:54.830 --> 00:58:56.650
<v Speaker 2>had consumed a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that had consumed Sicily.</v>

1237
00:58:56.890 --> 00:59:01.890
<v Speaker 2>And then the kimbery this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this great Germanic hoard that it </v>

1238
00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:04.000
<v Speaker 2>would've just been sort of wandering </v>
<v Speaker 2>around Europe for like 15 years,</v>

1239
00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:07.020
<v Speaker 2>would constantly come back around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the north.</v>

1240
00:59:07.021 --> 00:59:08.770
<v Speaker 2>So the northern border was very </v>
<v Speaker 2>insecure.</v>

1241
00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.320
<v Speaker 2>So I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1242
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:13.600
<v Speaker 2>it was a matter of just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in this emergency situation,</v>

1243
00:59:13.601 --> 00:59:16.150
<v Speaker 2>we need to raise men and we need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>raise a lot of men.</v>

1244
00:59:16.151 --> 00:59:17.890
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just go ahead and do it.</v>

1245
00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:22.310
<v Speaker 2>And I think from that point on they just</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of realized that,</v>

1246
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:24.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1247
00:59:24.330 --> 00:59:29.330
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was a way to keep up with the </v>

1248
00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:29.390
<v Speaker 2>manpower needs that their empire now </v>
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

1249
00:59:29.391 --> 00:59:34.391
<v Speaker 2>They were no longer just this little </v>
<v Speaker 2>city state that was occasionally </v>

1250
00:59:34.391 --> 00:59:34.880
<v Speaker 2>skirmishing with the Sam nights down </v>
<v Speaker 2>around capital a.</v>

1251
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:35.630
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1252
00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:38.450
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have garrison's we need to be filling</v>

1253
00:59:38.451 --> 00:59:41.150
<v Speaker 2>in Spain and North Africa and up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gaul.</v>

1254
00:59:41.151 --> 00:59:44.570
<v Speaker 2>And as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they move into goal of the Macedonian</v>

1255
00:59:44.571 --> 00:59:46.460
<v Speaker 2>frontier over in Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're now,</v>

1256
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:49.040
<v Speaker 2>they're now in charge of western Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1257
00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:54.640
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are we going to keep the legions </v>

1258
00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:54.640
<v Speaker 2>filled?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think once,</v>

1259
00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:56.030
<v Speaker 2>I think once they made the decision to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go over to like,</v>

1260
00:59:56.031 --> 00:59:58.580
<v Speaker 2>let's just drop this property </v>
<v Speaker 2>requirement in general,</v>

1261
00:59:58.581 --> 01:00:03.581
<v Speaker 2>I think it was fairly wildly successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of their ability to raise the </v>

1262
01:00:03.581 --> 01:00:07.160
<v Speaker 2>men needed to run their empire and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1263
01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:12.220
<v Speaker 2>how does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does that move over to the real </v>

1264
01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:15.281
<v Speaker 2>danger point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is people raising personal armies </v>

1265
01:00:15.281 --> 01:00:18.370
<v Speaker 2>and I think a lot of this like a decent </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough analogy like not exactly is like </v>

1266
01:00:19.011 --> 01:00:24.011
<v Speaker 2>a political party going and looking for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a candidate who can sell finance their </v>

1267
01:00:24.011 --> 01:00:26.990
<v Speaker 2>campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political parties at the state level,</v>

1268
01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:27.890
<v Speaker 2>at the national level.</v>

1269
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Always love a candidate who can walk in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>

1270
01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:30.980
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1271
01:00:30.981 --> 01:00:33.230
<v Speaker 2>like the party doesn't need to give me </v>
<v Speaker 2>any money.</v>

1272
01:00:33.231 --> 01:00:38.231
<v Speaker 2>I'll just do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just do this all out of my own </v>

1273
01:00:38.231 --> 01:00:38.231
<v Speaker 2>pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm,</v>

1274
01:00:38.231 --> 01:00:38.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

1275
01:00:38.231 --> 01:00:38.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm a hedge fund manager.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am a,</v>

1276
01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:44.100
<v Speaker 2>an owner of a business or like Michael </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bloomberg is just like whatever it is </v>

1277
01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:44.330
<v Speaker 2>that he's sitting on top of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1278
01:00:44.331 --> 01:00:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Democratic Party didn't need to</v>

1279
01:00:46.431 --> 01:00:51.431
<v Speaker 2>give him any money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could just do it all himself and the </v>

1280
01:00:51.431 --> 01:00:52.000
<v Speaker 2>same was really true of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1281
01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:54.290
<v Speaker 2>of later if people like pompey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1282
01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.460
<v Speaker 2>who could say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1283
01:00:55.461 --> 01:00:57.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go raise my own army.</v>

1284
01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even have to worry about it.</v>

1285
01:00:59.241 --> 01:01:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Like you elect me console,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do all the work for Ya.</v>

1286
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

1287
01:01:03.231 --> 01:01:08.231
<v Speaker 2>that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very immediately attractive </v>

1288
01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:08.540
<v Speaker 2>proposition for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially out there.</v>

1289
01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:11.060
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you don't want to go to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have a candidate who was like,</v>

1290
01:01:11.061 --> 01:01:16.061
<v Speaker 2>don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get my guys myself and you don't </v>

1291
01:01:16.061 --> 01:01:16.061
<v Speaker 2>have to do it if you don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1292
01:01:16.061 --> 01:01:20.350
<v Speaker 2>that's where you start getting these </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal legions being raised and once </v>

1293
01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:21.980
<v Speaker 2>those personal legions are being raised </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1294
01:01:21.981 --> 01:01:23.030
<v Speaker 2>now we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1295
01:01:23.031 --> 01:01:28.031
<v Speaker 2>the late republic is just a clash of </v>
<v Speaker 2>warlords and that is really right now </v>

1296
01:01:28.031 --> 01:01:28.250
<v Speaker 2>when you look at it and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1297
01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:33.251
<v Speaker 2>I see some similarities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there some real big differences and </v>

1298
01:01:33.251 --> 01:01:33.251
<v Speaker 2>we haven't gotten there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1299
01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1300
01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:37.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean honestly like the military thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1301
01:01:37.251 --> 01:01:42.251
<v Speaker 2>the United States has gone through a bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a similar process after Vietnam where</v>

1302
01:01:42.501 --> 01:01:44.180
<v Speaker 2>we said we're no longer going to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1303
01:01:44.181 --> 01:01:49.181
<v Speaker 2>like temporary conscription into an army</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go off and fight and instead we're </v>

1304
01:01:49.181 --> 01:01:51.050
<v Speaker 2>going to make it all volunteer and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all professional,</v>

1305
01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:51.710
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1306
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:52.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a similarity.</v>

1307
01:01:52.881 --> 01:01:56.510
<v Speaker 2>But there's so much about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutional,</v>

1308
01:01:56.930 --> 01:02:01.100
<v Speaker 2>what the US Army,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the US Navy institutionally is,</v>

1309
01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:06.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does not resemble the personal warlord </v>

1310
01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.660
<v Speaker 2>legions of the late republic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1311
01:02:07.661 --> 01:02:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Like the paymaster is not your kernel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The paymaster is,</v>

1312
01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:13.880
<v Speaker 2>is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the United States of America.</v>

1313
01:02:13.881 --> 01:02:15.070
<v Speaker 2>And we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1314
01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:19.350
<v Speaker 2>our checks don't ever bounce when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>go out there to some private or sergeant</v>

1315
01:02:19.351 --> 01:02:24.351
<v Speaker 2>or some major.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't have them being loyal </v>

1316
01:02:24.351 --> 01:02:26.670
<v Speaker 2>specifically to just one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one commander out there.</v>

1317
01:02:26.671 --> 01:02:28.020
<v Speaker 2>And then I have also heard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1318
01:02:28.021 --> 01:02:33.021
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had the good fortune to be friends </v>

1319
01:02:33.021 --> 01:02:35.181
<v Speaker 2>with a lots of veterans guys who were in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the military now or who have left and </v>

1320
01:02:35.181 --> 01:02:39.330
<v Speaker 2>are now veterans just back out in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilian world with the rest of us that,</v>

1321
01:02:39.570 --> 01:02:41.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's enough that goes on with trooper</v>

1322
01:02:41.631 --> 01:02:42.750
<v Speaker 2>rotations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1323
01:02:42.751 --> 01:02:44.250
<v Speaker 2>where you're kind of bouncing between </v>
<v Speaker 2>units.</v>

1324
01:02:44.251 --> 01:02:49.251
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're never forming one of these like </v>

1325
01:02:49.251 --> 01:02:50.160
<v Speaker 2>20 year long bonds where you guys have </v>
<v Speaker 2>all been serving together forever.</v>

1326
01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't,</v>

1327
01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:57.180
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't fear right now like the role of </v>

1328
01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:57.180
<v Speaker 2>the US army,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1329
01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:59.020
<v Speaker 2>in some kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some kind of war,</v>

1330
01:02:59.021 --> 01:03:02.640
<v Speaker 2>Lord style clash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see it happening anytime soon.</v>

1331
01:03:02.900 --> 01:03:05.690
<v Speaker 1>One of the great firewalls that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually working still.</v>

1332
01:03:05.691 --> 01:03:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

1333
01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there anything,</v>

1334
01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:14.411
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I didn't ask you about that you </v>

1335
01:03:14.411 --> 01:03:14.411
<v Speaker 1>want to make sure we know about the book</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some of the story?</v>

1336
01:03:14.411 --> 01:03:18.941
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I specifically focused on the things </v>

1337
01:03:18.941 --> 01:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>that I was interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a heck of a lot in this </v>

1338
01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else should the listeners know?</v>

1339
01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1340
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:23.550
<v Speaker 2>I think the one thing that we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>touch on that is a,</v>

1341
01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:28.600
<v Speaker 2>that is a pretty major part of the book </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has similarities to the United </v>

1342
01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:32.780
<v Speaker 2>States is this issue of the non.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Non Roman Italians were.</v>

1343
01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:33.410
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1344
01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were just in case you don't know the </v>

1345
01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:38.440
<v Speaker 2>backstory of this here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it real quick,</v>

1346
01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.390
<v Speaker 2>is that when Rome conquered Italy during</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sam night wars,</v>

1347
01:03:41.391 --> 01:03:44.630
<v Speaker 2>which is a couple of hundred years </v>
<v Speaker 2>before my book comes along.</v>

1348
01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:50.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Romans did not annex these people </v>

1349
01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:50.720
<v Speaker 2>directly into the Roman state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They instead signed these,</v>

1350
01:03:50.721 --> 01:03:52.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these treaties with the city,</v>

1351
01:03:52.521 --> 01:03:57.521
<v Speaker 2>so a city in an area or a city and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Umbria would then become merely an ally </v>

1352
01:03:57.830 --> 01:03:58.930
<v Speaker 2>of realm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when,</v>

1353
01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.960
<v Speaker 2>whenever the Romans came around to ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a legionaries for the army's,</v>

1354
01:04:03.050 --> 01:04:08.050
<v Speaker 2>the city had to provide them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But other than that they were mostly </v>

1355
01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:08.050
<v Speaker 2>left to their own devices.</v>

1356
01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:10.310
<v Speaker 2>They could govern themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't really taxed that heavily.</v>

1357
01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:14.060
<v Speaker 2>But what happens is when you get to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of my book,</v>

1358
01:04:14.061 --> 01:04:19.061
<v Speaker 2>a couple hundred years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys had been inside of Roman </v>

1359
01:04:19.061 --> 01:04:20.540
<v Speaker 2>civilization in every meaningful way for</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of years.</v>

1360
01:04:20.541 --> 01:04:23.390
<v Speaker 2>And yet they were still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't even call them second class</v>

1361
01:04:23.391 --> 01:04:25.520
<v Speaker 2>citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were not citizens at all.</v>

1362
01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:28.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're facing the same problems,</v>

1363
01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:31.130
<v Speaker 2>the same economic problems that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>roman cousins are,</v>

1364
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:34.640
<v Speaker 2>except they don't even have the right to</v>
<v Speaker 2>vote in an assembly.</v>

1365
01:04:34.641 --> 01:04:37.730
<v Speaker 2>They don't even have the right to send </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidates for office and be like,</v>

1366
01:04:37.731 --> 01:04:38.030
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1367
01:04:38.031 --> 01:04:41.390
<v Speaker 2>what about us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were on top of everything else.</v>

1368
01:04:41.391 --> 01:04:43.040
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were facing economic,</v>

1369
01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:47.540
<v Speaker 2>economic problems and also didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of political voice at all.</v>

1370
01:04:47.810 --> 01:04:52.810
<v Speaker 2>And so that combined with the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the general problems that are created by</v>

1371
01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:58.430
<v Speaker 2>the skyrocketing economic inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that leads to a [inaudible] style,</v>

1372
01:04:58.431 --> 01:05:01.930
<v Speaker 2>confrontational style of politics that </v>
<v Speaker 2>now defines,</v>

1373
01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:05.200
<v Speaker 2>that now defines the Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that entire force of it,</v>

1374
01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:06.470
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like energy,</v>

1375
01:05:06.471 --> 01:05:07.430
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could call it.</v>

1376
01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:12.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Italian question is what's </v>

1377
01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:15.160
<v Speaker 2>ultimately triggers the great civil wars</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Maurice and Sala is the Italians </v>

1378
01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.740
<v Speaker 2>constantly demanding citizenship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Romans constantly saying,</v>

1379
01:05:17.741 --> 01:05:22.741
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to give you citizenship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what it finally takes is a massive </v>

1380
01:05:22.741 --> 01:05:26.461
<v Speaker 2>bloody and destructive civil war where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Italians are not trying to break </v>

1381
01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:31.800
<v Speaker 2>away from Roman rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to force their way into </v>

1382
01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:31.800
<v Speaker 2>Roman road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a.</v>

1383
01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:36.270
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a war on behalf of </v>
<v Speaker 2>political equality rather than a war </v>

1384
01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:38.160
<v Speaker 2>premised on political independence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

1385
01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:41.110
<v Speaker 2>that's like the other big thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>floating around out there,</v>

1386
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:42.360
<v Speaker 2>but other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just.</v>

1387
01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.920
<v Speaker 2>You just read the book and I'll explain </v>
<v Speaker 2>it all to you.</v>

1388
01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:50.660
<v Speaker 1>As one of my professors said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every educated person in the Western </v>

1389
01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:54.351
<v Speaker 1>world should know the story that Mike </v>
<v Speaker 1>Duncan catalogs in the storm before the </v>

1390
01:05:54.351 --> 01:05:58.401
<v Speaker 1>storm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of the end of the Roman </v>

1391
01:05:58.401 --> 01:05:58.401
<v Speaker 1>republic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>

1392
01:05:58.401 --> 01:05:58.950
<v Speaker 1>thank you for coming on the program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish you the greatest success.</v>

1393
01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

1394
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I think that this is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you could not have chosen a </v>

1395
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:08.991
<v Speaker 1>better subject and I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's shocking that this doesn't already </v>

1396
01:06:08.991 --> 01:06:09.510
<v Speaker 1>have 20 books on the bookshelf about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1397
01:06:09.511 --> 01:06:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Considering how awesome and like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1398
01:06:11.950 --> 01:06:15.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to initiate enough disclaimers</v>

1399
01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:16.110
<v Speaker 1>where you tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1400
01:06:16.111 --> 01:06:18.270
<v Speaker 1>there's so many different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really like us,</v>

1401
01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:20.280
<v Speaker 1>but look at all these things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>like us,</v>

1402
01:06:20.281 --> 01:06:20.640
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1403
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figured if,</v>

1404
01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:27.380
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to do it because like </v>

1405
01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:27.470
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I always push </v>
<v Speaker 2>against is that I don't think that we're</v>

1406
01:06:27.471 --> 01:06:30.370
<v Speaker 2>anywhere near like the fall of Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1407
01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:32.090
<v Speaker 2>which is something that you hear from </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like,</v>

1408
01:06:32.091 --> 01:06:37.091
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Syrian refugees are just like the </v>

1409
01:06:37.091 --> 01:06:37.091
<v Speaker 2>vandals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1410
01:06:37.091 --> 01:06:37.500
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1411
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we start killing each other over </v>

1412
01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:42.600
<v Speaker 2>political things then we're starting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>move a little bit in the are.</v>

1413
01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:42.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1414
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:47.950
<v Speaker 2>like if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we actually have like a mass </v>

1415
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:47.950
<v Speaker 2>migrating population that has like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire,</v>

1416
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:52.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>entire armed force that can go toe to </v>

1417
01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:53.660
<v Speaker 2>toe with the US army,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I guess,</v>

1418
01:06:53.661 --> 01:06:54.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can start talking about it,</v>

1419
01:06:54.891 --> 01:06:56.420
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think we're anywhere near </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1420
01:06:56.421 --> 01:07:00.240
<v Speaker 2>I think your $300 senators with Tiberius</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grok as.</v>

1421
01:07:00.241 --> 01:07:03.080
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the moment where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sea change would happen.</v>

1422
01:07:03.081 --> 01:07:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1423
01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:08.260
<v Speaker 2>I think that that period of the Grok </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes is enough that I'm,</v>

1424
01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:12.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to now insert this idea into </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's heads and saying like,</v>

1425
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:14.630
<v Speaker 2>this is the period we need to be paying </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

1426
01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1427
01:07:16.031 --> 01:07:21.031
<v Speaker 1>It's not just for interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's what my professor was </v>

1428
01:07:21.031 --> 01:07:21.880
<v Speaker 1>pointing out that if you're an American </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this system,</v>

1429
01:07:21.881 --> 01:07:26.881
<v Speaker 1>this is a story that our founding </v>
<v Speaker 1>fathers thought was worth knowing </v>

1430
01:07:26.881 --> 01:07:28.420
<v Speaker 1>probably for an informed citizenry of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a modern commercial.</v>

1431
01:07:28.421 --> 01:07:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Imperial Republic might be a good idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>to buy Mike Duncan's book.</v>

1432
01:07:32.141 --> 01:07:33.670
<v Speaker 1>So that's the way I'm going to phrase </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1433
01:07:33.790 --> 01:07:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if dude,</v>

1434
01:07:34.421 --> 01:07:35.210
<v Speaker 1>if I can do anything</v>

1435
01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.150
<v Speaker 2>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here.</v>

1436

1437

<v Speaker 2>That was fun.</v>

1438
