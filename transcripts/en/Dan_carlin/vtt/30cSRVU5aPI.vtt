<v Speaker 1>started today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hardcore history.</v>

8
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.030
<v Speaker 1>I've said before that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful side benefits of a gig like </v>

9
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.841
<v Speaker 1>this is the chance to speak to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>whose work you really admire and talked </v>

10
00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:42.631
<v Speaker 1>to them about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in this case I have a guest on the </v>

11
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:45.401
<v Speaker 1>program today who is a source,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody that we use in our work and </v>

12
00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:49.841
<v Speaker 1>when we did blueprint for Armageddon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was sort of my go to guy in terms of </v>

13
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:56.351
<v Speaker 1>somebody that I knew could add a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different dimension to the storytelling </v>

14
00:00:56.901 --> 00:01:01.901
<v Speaker 1>by having a letter or a document or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote or something that was just,</v>

15
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so visceral or perfect or emotional or </v>

16
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.641
<v Speaker 1>that in one short little paragraph </v>
<v Speaker 1>managed to capture such a poignant point</v>

17
00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:17.870
<v Speaker 1>that just sort of made the whole section</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the piece.</v>

18
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:22.871
<v Speaker 1>I mean Peter Hearts work is finding </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional nuggets that just knock you </v>

19
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:27.911
<v Speaker 1>over and then incorporating them into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story in a way where they not only </v>

20
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:33.041
<v Speaker 1>have the most impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they managed to add a part of the </v>

21
00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:33.470
<v Speaker 1>story that often gets missed.</v>

22
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.760
<v Speaker 1>If you're telling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

23
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.030
<v Speaker 1>a story on the first World War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is Peter Harte specialty.</v>

24
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.420
<v Speaker 1>It is so easy to get yourself locked </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the giant troop movements in the </v>

25
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.710
<v Speaker 1>big decisions made at headquarters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this.</v>

26
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you can go the total opposite </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme and it's easy to get caught up </v>

27
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.220
<v Speaker 1>in the diary of this one soldier or this</v>
<v Speaker 1>one nurse or something like that,</v>

28
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.990
<v Speaker 1>but to be able to blend the two in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that helps you understand,</v>

29
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:04.991
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the decision's made at headquarters </v>

30
00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:06.110
<v Speaker 1>with all those high muckety mucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about things abstractly,</v>

31
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.120
<v Speaker 1>how they influence and intersect with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lives of some poor guy,</v>

32
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.410
<v Speaker 1>mortally wounded in a shell hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing his last letter back to his wife</v>

33
00:02:15.411 --> 00:02:20.411
<v Speaker 1>and family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an art and I think Peter Hart does </v>

34
00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:24.761
<v Speaker 1>it as well or better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially on the subject of the first </v>

35
00:02:24.761 --> 00:02:25.490
<v Speaker 1>World War than anyone I've ever read.</v>

36
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.660
<v Speaker 1>So you get to see me enjoying my </v>
<v Speaker 1>byproduct.</v>

37
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.360
<v Speaker 1>The best aspect of this Gig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chance to talk to people whose work </v>

38
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Speaker 1>you admire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like Peter Hart,</v>

39
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.420
<v Speaker 1>who is amongst other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an oral historian by the way at the </v>

40
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.980
<v Speaker 1>British imperial war museum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is every military history,</v>

41
00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:47.390
<v Speaker 1>nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream gig.</v>

42
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Love to go to work by a couple of giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>15 inch naval guns.</v>

43
00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Which one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:53.171 --> 00:02:58.171
<v Speaker 1>they have several of these war museums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the main one in London has the big </v>

45
00:02:58.171 --> 00:02:59.940
<v Speaker 1>naval guns outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just take a picture.</v>

46
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>Here's where I work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

47
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Eat your heart out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

48
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one little note.</v>

49
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Normally we have an in house phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>system we use when we do interviews,</v>

50
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.090
<v Speaker 1>but normally we only use that for North </v>
<v Speaker 1>American interviews when we're overseas </v>

51
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.320
<v Speaker 1>calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been using sort of an internet </v>

52
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.301
<v Speaker 1>system and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this time it led us down with some </v>

53
00:03:18.301 --> 00:03:20.851
<v Speaker 1>pretty serious glitches at times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially near the end of the </v>

54
00:03:20.851 --> 00:03:20.851
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>

55
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>Not only my apologies to Peter Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to you also.</v>

56
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's frustrating and there was no way </v>

57
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 1>for us to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I am going to put a couple of,</v>

58
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.150
<v Speaker 1>shall we call them end notes after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview where I both a quote something</v>

59
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>that we referenced in the show so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we include that,</v>

60
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explained something.</v>

61
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Mr Hart said at the end that the digital</v>
<v Speaker 1>glitches did not make easy to understand</v>

62
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.550
<v Speaker 1>and also read a letter that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>referenced in the story to something </v>

63
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Speaker 1>that Peter Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a uncovered for one of his books that we</v>

64
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:59.101
<v Speaker 1>used in the blueprint for Armageddon </v>
<v Speaker 1>series and reread that to just show you </v>

65
00:03:59.101 --> 00:04:02.581
<v Speaker 1>the man's ability to demonstrate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ripples of pain that something like this</v>

66
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 1>conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:09.100
<v Speaker 1>created in that era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in those societies,</v>

68
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:11.380
<v Speaker 1>and drop you right into the middle of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a minute.</v>

69
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.360
<v Speaker 1>So without further ado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 1>the wonderful author and oral war </v>
<v Speaker 1>historian,</v>

71
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 1>maybe a good way to put it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Great Peter Hart.</v>

72
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.170
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing I want to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm just curious as a person who</v>

73
00:04:24.171 --> 00:04:29.171
<v Speaker 2>is absolutely jealous of anyone who can </v>
<v Speaker 2>find such a specialty to devote their </v>

74
00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:30.980
<v Speaker 2>lives to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

75
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 2>how did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for you mostly become because you've </v>

76
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.530
<v Speaker 2>done other things but mostly become </v>
<v Speaker 2>something about the first world war.</v>

77
00:04:36.531 --> 00:04:41.531
<v Speaker 2>What grabbed your interest about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what is it that keeps you so </v>

78
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:41.531
<v Speaker 2>interested in the subject?</v>

79
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.540
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it started when I was young and </v>

80
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.750
<v Speaker 3>there was a program called the Great </v>
<v Speaker 3>Wall,</v>

81
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was all Italian,</v>

82
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 3>the 19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was gloomy and miserable and it </v>

83
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.011
<v Speaker 3>seems so awful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People suffered so much and for me it's </v>

84
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:04.051
<v Speaker 3>always been that dichotomy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a dichotomy between the people who </v>

85
00:05:04.051 --> 00:05:08.940
<v Speaker 3>suffered and what the generals did and </v>
<v Speaker 3>why they did that because you may or may</v>

86
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:13.951
<v Speaker 3>not realize I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I quite support the approach of the </v>

87
00:05:13.951 --> 00:05:16.831
<v Speaker 3>generals and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the way that it's an entirely </v>

88
00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:20.371
<v Speaker 3>logical way of behaving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's terrible for those that are </v>

89
00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 3>involved and that has always informed or</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope has informed all the work.</v>

90
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:24.990
<v Speaker 3>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

91
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.590
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

92
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 3>it's what it's all about for me</v>

93
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.530
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've been doing it long enough so that</v>

94
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:34.531
<v Speaker 2>you've been around to watch sort of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>public perception over time on these </v>

95
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:39.811
<v Speaker 2>events has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I remember I was born in 1965 </v>

96
00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:40.570
<v Speaker 2>and I remember in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing up as a kid,</v>

97
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.990
<v Speaker 2>there was a sense about the first world </v>
<v Speaker 2>war that it was like the Second World </v>

98
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.490
<v Speaker 2>War,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a little less in terms of the good </v>

99
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.490
<v Speaker 2>and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still the good and evil.</v>

100
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.630
<v Speaker 2>The Kaiser was evil man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not quite to Hitler standards.</v>

101
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.900
<v Speaker 2>And then since I've grown up that good </v>
<v Speaker 2>evil aspect to first world war has </v>

102
00:05:58.131 --> 00:05:59.520
<v Speaker 2>seemed to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

103
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.540
<v Speaker 2>to fade over time quite a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least here in the United States.</v>

104
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:07.541
<v Speaker 2>Have you noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you comment a little bit on the </v>

105
00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:07.541
<v Speaker 2>differences in the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

106
00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 2>Barbara Tuchman writes a book years ago </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

107
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.450
<v Speaker 2>that Jack Kennedy reads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really particularly hard on the </v>

108
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.651
<v Speaker 2>Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stuff I read today has a very </v>

109
00:06:17.651 --> 00:06:19.601
<v Speaker 2>different tone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What have you noticed in the change of </v>

110
00:06:19.601 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 2>if we were doing news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would say the coverage over the last,</v>

111
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:22.580
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four decades of the first world war.</v>

112
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

113
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 3>I've noticed a fair amount of coverage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My perception has always been that in </v>

114
00:06:29.341 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 3>the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if there were batteries,</v>

115
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 3>then it was the Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that there were a lot of people </v>

116
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.900
<v Speaker 3>doing things that were difficult or </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>

117
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there were four or five major m and</v>

118
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:46.470
<v Speaker 3>pause that was struggling together </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to establish domination.</v>

119
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.750
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them had agendas that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't particularly recognizes today </v>

120
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.050
<v Speaker 3>has been a pleasant or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

121
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

122
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:54.780
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the colonialism,</v>

123
00:06:54.781 --> 00:06:56.050
<v Speaker 3>things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

124
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.780
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that treatment of the colonies,</v>

125
00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.010
<v Speaker 3>the way they generally behaved and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

126
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.950
<v Speaker 3>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

127
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.300
<v Speaker 3>we have now an acceptance that whilst </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Germans pushed the war,</v>

128
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.520
<v Speaker 3>they were partly did that because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were being pushed,</v>

129
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.530
<v Speaker 3>bothered the Russians and the French and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the French who had their own agendas.</v>

130
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.530
<v Speaker 3>And it's just become much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>complicated.</v>

131
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.880
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is,</v>

132
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:21.990
<v Speaker 3>it's not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it?</v>

133
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem with history that </v>

134
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.280
<v Speaker 3>when you add new orleans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things stopped being good and evil.</v>

135
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.860
<v Speaker 3>So becoming just much more complex</v>

136
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:37.200
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things you do so </v>

137
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:37.200
<v Speaker 2>fantastically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we try to do it here too.</v>

138
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.290
<v Speaker 2>It's a great if you can pull it off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great way to do it.</v>

139
00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:43.291
<v Speaker 2>You pull it off all the time where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're able to take the reader from the </v>

140
00:07:43.291 --> 00:07:47.551
<v Speaker 2>macro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you'll have us in the in the </v>

141
00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:49.981
<v Speaker 2>board room and you'll have quotes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>assistance to the great grand </v>

142
00:07:49.981 --> 00:07:54.661
<v Speaker 2>strategists who are deciding how to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>troops on the battlefield and then all </v>

143
00:07:54.661 --> 00:07:55.930
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden you'll telescope down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>some poor,</v>

144
00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:01.410
<v Speaker 2>a combatant who's injured mortally in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some shell hole who's writing alas,</v>

145
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:06.810
<v Speaker 2>letter to his wife and kids that he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to strapped to his body to find </v>

146
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:06.820
<v Speaker 2>later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

147
00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:09.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explain to the listener a little bit how</v>

148
00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:14.281
<v Speaker 2>you go about finding these materials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would seem to me to be one of the </v>

149
00:08:14.281 --> 00:08:16.480
<v Speaker 2>luxuries of working in a in a semi </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern era.</v>

150
00:08:16.481 --> 00:08:21.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean the poor Roman historian has much</v>
<v Speaker 2>less in the way of letters from </v>

151
00:08:21.481 --> 00:08:21.550
<v Speaker 2>combatants to go on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

152
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.740
<v Speaker 2>But you're able to mind emotionally mine</v>
<v Speaker 2>this material out there.</v>

153
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.920
<v Speaker 2>How do you find it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it's as powerful as it is on the </v>

154
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.281
<v Speaker 2>sterile text page as I'm reading it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much more powerful is it for you </v>

155
00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:38.590
<v Speaker 2>when you're holding the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual stained letter in your hands?</v>

156
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say more than my books that I found </v>

157
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.720
<v Speaker 3>a letter that was from a French soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used that,</v>

158
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.260
<v Speaker 3>but I am extremely lucky that I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been for the last 30,</v>

159
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.000
<v Speaker 3>35 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the oral historian at the imperial war.</v>

160
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 3>So I a did all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot.</v>

161
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:03.321
<v Speaker 3>Not all at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I did a lot of the first row or </v>

162
00:09:03.321 --> 00:09:06.021
<v Speaker 3>interviews with veterans and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>provided with a fantastic source which </v>

163
00:09:06.021 --> 00:09:07.620
<v Speaker 3>the war museums allowed me to use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And secondly,</v>

164
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:11.450
<v Speaker 3>I have worked closely with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Department of documents there that uh,</v>

165
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.700
<v Speaker 3>and that just opening the dusty old </v>
<v Speaker 3>folders that they're all cataloged and </v>

166
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 3>preserved by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the staff.</v>

167
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:24.140
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you open these and you no idea what </v>

168
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.620
<v Speaker 3>you're going to find.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes it can be utterly tedious.</v>

169
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe's letter after letter or boring you.</v>

170
00:09:28.621 --> 00:09:29.130
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

171
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.160
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then suddenly you get someone </v>

172
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:34.160
<v Speaker 3>swimming.</v>

173
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:34.200
<v Speaker 3>It's really fiscal that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that tears you apart,</v>

174
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 3>that you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just get letters at that,</v>

175
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.820
<v Speaker 3>you realize these are the last letters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

176
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:45.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been reading this bloke's life </v>

177
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.240
<v Speaker 3>and then suddenly they're suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not his letter,</v>

178
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:48.050
<v Speaker 3>it's a letter from his commanding </v>
<v Speaker 3>officer and you know,</v>

179
00:09:48.051 --> 00:09:49.680
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

180
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.150
<v Speaker 3>And I just think I'm very lucky to work </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the war museum from that.</v>

181
00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:56.130
<v Speaker 3>I then look through lots of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>sources.</v>

182
00:09:56.131 --> 00:10:01.131
<v Speaker 3>I go to other museums,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go to other places and of course I </v>

183
00:10:01.131 --> 00:10:01.530
<v Speaker 3>look at personal experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

184
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:02.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>books,</v>

185
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.480
<v Speaker 3>mainly old ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I use quite a few modern one </v>

186
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:08.480
<v Speaker 3>serve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

187
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.410
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or regimental history is often have it </v>

188
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:13.410
<v Speaker 3>buried inside them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Personal experience accounts,</v>

189
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:14.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Americans.</v>

190
00:10:14.541 --> 00:10:19.541
<v Speaker 3>I picked up a lot from the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the pdfs of the books are 19 </v>

191
00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.410
<v Speaker 3>twenties are online and you can consult </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

192
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.690
<v Speaker 3>It's fabulous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

193
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.100
<v Speaker 3>and that's where I get the material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

194
00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:26.910
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

195
00:10:26.911 --> 00:10:27.810
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be,</v>

196
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

197
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.550
<v Speaker 3>the actual real letters that I see at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the museum can be really painful.</v>

198
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:36.440
<v Speaker 2>Obviously humans are humans at Ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>Zero,</v>

199
00:10:36.441 --> 00:10:41.441
<v Speaker 2>but when you're reading and you focus </v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly on the British side of the </v>

200
00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:41.441
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you cover everything,</v>

201
00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:44.540
<v Speaker 2>do you notice any broad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broad differences in,</v>

202
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:50.350
<v Speaker 2>say you're reading something from ground</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero from a French soldier or some </v>

203
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.000
<v Speaker 2>German soldier on the line versus some </v>
<v Speaker 2>British or American soldier.</v>

204
00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:58.420
<v Speaker 2>Are there any differences in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that their national </v>

205
00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.901
<v Speaker 2>characteristics sort of come through in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the material or at ground zero when </v>

206
00:11:01.901 --> 00:11:04.130
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting in a trench with </v>
<v Speaker 2>artillery falling all around you are.</v>

207
00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:05.900
<v Speaker 2>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are broadly the same.</v>

208
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:11.980
<v Speaker 3>I very much go for broadly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a great believer in national </v>

209
00:11:12.411 --> 00:11:17.411
<v Speaker 3>characteristics I need anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can help sometimes it's a shorthand </v>

210
00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:20.630
<v Speaker 3>to explain certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you take it too literally it goes</v>

211
00:11:20.631 --> 00:11:22.050
<v Speaker 3>into dark alleys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

212
00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:22.640
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

213
00:11:22.641 --> 00:11:25.430
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think though is that underneath</v>

214
00:11:25.431 --> 00:11:30.431
<v Speaker 3>human beings when they placed under real</v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure tend to respond in a similar </v>

215
00:11:31.371 --> 00:11:33.110
<v Speaker 3>sort of way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for me,</v>

216
00:11:33.111 --> 00:11:35.340
<v Speaker 3>a French soldier that the accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

217
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.700
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I have to translate which can </v>
<v Speaker 3>be difficult.</v>

218
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:38.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gray,</v>

219
00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a friend of Mine,</v>

220
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:44.450
<v Speaker 3>translation to the German ones for me </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't speak or read German.</v>

221
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:50.060
<v Speaker 3>And fundamentally they're the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have slightly different ways of </v>

222
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.500
<v Speaker 3>expressing themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's just cultural.</v>

223
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.490
<v Speaker 3>But underneath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the shelves are falling,</v>

224
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.830
<v Speaker 3>when their friends are killed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

225
00:11:56.831 --> 00:12:00.160
<v Speaker 3>when they given oldest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could lead them to be killed.</v>

226
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.680
<v Speaker 3>There.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same sort of people.</v>

227
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:04.080
<v Speaker 3>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

228
00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:04.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

229
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.180
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just ordinary people.</v>

230
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:12.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's maybe one of the things that at </v>

231
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:14.531
<v Speaker 2>least I imagine touches many people once</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start in a reading about the war is</v>

232
00:12:14.871 --> 00:12:16.520
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these incidents where,</v>

233
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:17.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

234
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.060
<v Speaker 2>the comradeship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the German soldiers would say,</v>

235
00:12:20.061 --> 00:12:22.490
<v Speaker 2>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the soldiers have multiple sides who,</v>

236
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more and more modern history's we'll </v>

237
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:28.550
<v Speaker 2>talk about how prisoners would be killed</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes and all the horrors of war.</v>

238
00:12:28.551 --> 00:12:30.260
<v Speaker 2>And yet at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

239
00:12:30.261 --> 00:12:33.710
<v Speaker 2>the notion is when these people end up </v>
<v Speaker 2>having truces where they,</v>

240
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>share Christmas decorations or play </v>

241
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 2>football,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you guys would call it soccer,</v>

242
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.700
<v Speaker 2>we would call it or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or any of the many,</v>

243
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:45.730
<v Speaker 2>many incidents like that getting stuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a shell hole with someone from the </v>

244
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.701
<v Speaker 2>other side in your latest book that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a primary source quote where a British </v>

245
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:53.291
<v Speaker 2>soldier had his arm really badly injured</v>
<v Speaker 2>and goes marching to the back with a </v>

246
00:12:53.291 --> 00:12:55.790
<v Speaker 2>bunch of German prisoners who start </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctoring his wounds.</v>

247
00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Do you notice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't see as much of that and </v>

248
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:02.120
<v Speaker 2>it might be part of the historiography </v>
<v Speaker 2>or what have you,</v>

249
00:13:02.121 --> 00:13:07.121
<v Speaker 2>part of the myth making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when I read stuff in the Second </v>

250
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:10.360
<v Speaker 2>World War,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find a lot less of that than in the </v>

251
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.281
<v Speaker 2>first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything in on the front of your mind </v>

252
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:12.281
<v Speaker 2>that might account for the difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>

253
00:13:12.281 --> 00:13:13.940
<v Speaker 2>Or Am I just imagining that there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>one?</v>

254
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:22.230
<v Speaker 3>If there is a there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was more hatred in the Second </v>

255
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.440
<v Speaker 3>World War.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we all,</v>

256
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.280
<v Speaker 3>it's only our opinions from the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've read and,</v>

257
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.340
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I into,</v>

258
00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:32.341
<v Speaker 3>I've interviewed an awful lot of second </v>
<v Speaker 3>one more second world war soldiers in </v>

259
00:13:32.341 --> 00:13:32.341
<v Speaker 3>the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'll just,</v>

260
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:37.440
<v Speaker 3>and there is more hatred there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit bit because of the nature of the </v>

261
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.110
<v Speaker 3>regime they're fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

262
00:13:38.111 --> 00:13:41.220
<v Speaker 3>The communist regime in Russia was </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty rough as well,</v>

263
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.960
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was a hatred of the Nazis,</v>

264
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:49.200
<v Speaker 3>but very rarely in any war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are not many soldiers that,</v>

265
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:50.290
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

266
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.700
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that respond,</v>

267
00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with murder and torture.</v>

268
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.540
<v Speaker 3>And the rest of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of them in my experience,</v>

269
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a main maintain a lid on their emotions.</v>

270
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.310
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

271
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:02.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

272
00:14:02.931 --> 00:14:03.850
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's there,</v>

273
00:14:03.851 --> 00:14:07.300
<v Speaker 3>but there are a few who do respond with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

274
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:08.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

275
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.270
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just murder,</v>

276
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>

277
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:12.430
<v Speaker 3>or panic.</v>

278
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.790
<v Speaker 3>Often it's panic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The trick,</v>

279
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:19.900
<v Speaker 3>the trick is the murder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the first World War that you've </v>

280
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:25.620
<v Speaker 3>mentioned it first up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comradeship is the thing that binds the </v>

281
00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:27.260
<v Speaker 3>army's together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But most of all,</v>

282
00:14:27.261 --> 00:14:30.190
<v Speaker 3>it binds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It binds you to your fellow soldiers.</v>

283
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:34.090
<v Speaker 3>That's what helps you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it lets you go over the top.</v>

284
00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:39.280
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a king and country a or </v>

285
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:39.790
<v Speaker 3>precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

286
00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.040
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

287
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.900
<v Speaker 3>it's not religion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What in the end when it all comes down </v>

288
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:47.410
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's mostly the bugs.</v>

289
00:14:47.411 --> 00:14:48.680
<v Speaker 3>You're with your mates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

290
00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.890
<v Speaker 3>the men who went through training with </v>
<v Speaker 3>who faced death with you,</v>

291
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.680
<v Speaker 3>that that's what helps you get through </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

292
00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:00.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned something going over the </v>

293
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.391
<v Speaker 2>top a minute ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such an iconic way of differentiating </v>

294
00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:06.891
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least western front experience of </v>

295
00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:06.891
<v Speaker 2>this war from all the others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

296
00:15:06.891 --> 00:15:11.081
<v Speaker 2>it occurs to me that because of sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the nature of technology and the way </v>

297
00:15:11.081 --> 00:15:15.201
<v Speaker 2>things have gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're ever going to get </v>

298
00:15:15.201 --> 00:15:18.680
<v Speaker 2>the same experience that those first </v>
<v Speaker 2>world war soldiers went through ever </v>

299
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:18.870
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

300
00:15:18.871 --> 00:15:23.871
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're ever gonna have </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds and hundreds or thousands of </v>

301
00:15:23.871 --> 00:15:25.440
<v Speaker 2>guns peppering a small space of </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory anymore.</v>

302
00:15:25.441 --> 00:15:27.330
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to because of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>accuracy.</v>

303
00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.760
<v Speaker 2>You're never going to mix them with gas </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you did.</v>

304
00:15:29.761 --> 00:15:34.761
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think as I do that that would </v>

305
00:15:34.761 --> 00:15:37.371
<v Speaker 2>have been equal to the worst place a </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldier could have ever been right in </v>

306
00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:39.630
<v Speaker 2>front of the line about to go over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top western front.</v>

307
00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're ever going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>that experience again.</v>

308
00:15:42.571 --> 00:15:44.010
<v Speaker 2>You're never going to have human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>

309
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.570
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I forgot the.</v>

310
00:15:45.571 --> 00:15:50.571
<v Speaker 2>I'm the author who had said one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers described watching a forest </v>

311
00:15:50.571 --> 00:15:52.410
<v Speaker 2>disappear in front of his eyes due to </v>
<v Speaker 2>artillery.</v>

312
00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:57.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a human experience that I don't </v>

313
00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:58.530
<v Speaker 2>think any human being's going to ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>see again in the beginning of the second</v>

314
00:15:58.531 --> 00:16:00.330
<v Speaker 2>world war Churchill's history of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

315
00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:05.510
<v Speaker 2>He talked about what was in store in 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19 if the war hadn't ended in 1918.</v>

316
00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:08.250
<v Speaker 2>The various,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

317
00:16:08.251 --> 00:16:12.150
<v Speaker 2>horrible concoctions that the allies had</v>
<v Speaker 2>put together your latest book.</v>

318
00:16:12.151 --> 00:16:15.900
<v Speaker 2>The last battle is from that era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you talk a little bit about what 19,</v>

319
00:16:15.901 --> 00:16:17.610
<v Speaker 2>19 on the front might have looked like?</v>

320
00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:19.380
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

321
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:21.180
<v Speaker 3>the British had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

322
00:16:21.181 --> 00:16:23.370
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Germans had that blue cross gas.</v>

323
00:16:23.371 --> 00:16:27.360
<v Speaker 3>It didn't work properly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mixture of a punishes gas and the sort</v>

324
00:16:27.370 --> 00:16:30.690
<v Speaker 3>of particles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the particles made you vomit,</v>

325
00:16:30.691 --> 00:16:33.520
<v Speaker 3>so he had to take your gas mask off and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they got,</v>

326
00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the poisonous gas.</v>

327
00:16:34.651 --> 00:16:39.651
<v Speaker 3>Got You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the German version didn't work </v>

328
00:16:39.651 --> 00:16:42.291
<v Speaker 3>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the British had worked out on their </v>

329
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:44.631
<v Speaker 3>allies by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd worked out how to do it and I fully </v>

330
00:16:44.631 --> 00:16:46.690
<v Speaker 3>intended to poison most of the German </v>
<v Speaker 3>army in 19,</v>

331
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.520
<v Speaker 3>19.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

332
00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.310
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a vicious war.</v>

333
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.130
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

334
00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.890
<v Speaker 3>and the practices in a way that was just</v>
<v Speaker 3>one step forward,</v>

335
00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:55.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

336
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.200
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we've sort of moved on.</v>

337
00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:03.230
<v Speaker 3>Then it was mass barrages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's no need for mass priorities </v>

338
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:07.191
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And although we did revert to it after </v>

339
00:17:07.191 --> 00:17:07.191
<v Speaker 3>El Alamein for instance as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they have them on the,</v>

340
00:17:07.191 --> 00:17:10.350
<v Speaker 3>in 1944 on the west,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only in Europe,</v>

341
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:13.470
<v Speaker 3>but it's replaced by mass bombing isn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

342
00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:18.650
<v Speaker 3>And then of course it's a nuclear method</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then its accuracy and so technology </v>

343
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:23.601
<v Speaker 3>moves on and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like the killing can still be on a </v>

344
00:17:23.601 --> 00:17:23.640
<v Speaker 3>mass scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For instance,</v>

345
00:17:23.641 --> 00:17:27.090
<v Speaker 3>in the Iraq war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was mass killing the Gulf war,</v>

346
00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:31.710
<v Speaker 3>mass killing of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an it needs to be remembered.</v>

347
00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:35.850
<v Speaker 3>What happens is the masculine tends not </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be on our side anymore.</v>

348
00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:37.490
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

349
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:40.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>

350
00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.750
<v Speaker 3>that pretty well how I feel about it.</v>

351
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:44.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is interesting too,</v>

352
00:17:44.741 --> 00:17:49.741
<v Speaker 2>because when we were talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first world war in the series that we </v>

353
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:49.741
<v Speaker 2>did on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

354
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:49.741
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

355
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.770
<v Speaker 2>you almost want to overwhelm the </v>
<v Speaker 2>listener with both the casualty </v>

356
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.500
<v Speaker 2>statistics and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of mean,</v>

357
00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.660
<v Speaker 2>the sheer numbers of things like shells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the numbers overwhelm you.</v>

358
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:01.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

359
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.960
<v Speaker 2>a lot of Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

360
00:18:03.961 --> 00:18:08.961
<v Speaker 2>they like to tell jokes about the French</v>
<v Speaker 2>and surrendering in the Second World </v>

361
00:18:08.961 --> 00:18:09.330
<v Speaker 2>War.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you would like to point out,</v>

362
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

363
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when did our side ever take 27,000</v>

364
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.680
<v Speaker 2>dead in a single day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

365
00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:18.510
<v Speaker 2>those kind of numbers are so </v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelming that in the United States,</v>

366
00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:23.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of memorials to the </v>

367
00:18:23.511 --> 00:18:25.221
<v Speaker 2>first world war and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you go to Europe and they are </v>

368
00:18:25.221 --> 00:18:25.221
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

369
00:18:25.221 --> 00:18:27.000
<v Speaker 2>can you talk a little bit about sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lasting effect?</v>

370
00:18:27.001 --> 00:18:27.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

371
00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:32.860
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feeling of connection to the first </v>

372
00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:32.860
<v Speaker 2>world war never died down in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it</v>

373
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:33.790
<v Speaker 3>not really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

374
00:18:33.791 --> 00:18:37.610
<v Speaker 3>for the French and Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was monstrously painful business.</v>

375
00:18:37.611 --> 00:18:40.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are much hotter than the British.</v>

376
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:42.130
<v Speaker 3>The French in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll right.</v>

377
00:18:42.131 --> 00:18:43.520
<v Speaker 3>That's all nate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

378
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.150
<v Speaker 3>I'd say August 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>14,</v>

379
00:18:46.151 --> 00:18:50.020
<v Speaker 3>the French lost 27,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead in a single day.</v>

380
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.570
<v Speaker 3>Now the British,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when John about suffering,</v>

381
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.220
<v Speaker 3>I think a 600 that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

382
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:56.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

383
00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:01.950
<v Speaker 3>it's a different scale and the French </v>
<v Speaker 3>sector and the French then fault almost </v>

384
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:06.481
<v Speaker 3>on their own for two or three years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People say the Americans took a long </v>

385
00:19:06.481 --> 00:19:07.180
<v Speaker 3>time to get into the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

386
00:19:07.181 --> 00:19:10.030
<v Speaker 3>from a April 19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>17 to a,</v>

387
00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.460
<v Speaker 3>to well properly June,</v>
<v Speaker 3>July 19,</v>

388
00:19:12.461 --> 00:19:14.170
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>17 years.</v>

389
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.840
<v Speaker 3>Not 17 to 19 eight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so bit over a year.</v>

390
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.770
<v Speaker 3>But the British took from August 1914 to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the somme,</v>

391
00:19:20.771 --> 00:19:23.320
<v Speaker 3>July on the somme before we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly involved.</v>

392
00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:24.490
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

393
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.790
<v Speaker 3>that people often forget when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>throwing stones at other countries,</v>

394
00:19:27.791 --> 00:19:29.560
<v Speaker 3>they forget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we sometimes do it,</v>

395
00:19:29.561 --> 00:19:32.800
<v Speaker 3>the Americans or the Americans or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>French or British or the French.</v>

396
00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:38.340
<v Speaker 3>When you look at your own decide we </v>
<v Speaker 3>often have the same sort of problems or </v>

397
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:38.870
<v Speaker 3>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

398
00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.120
<v Speaker 3>false.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

399
00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.970
<v Speaker 3>and I find that it's one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting things.</v>

400
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:47.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the American losses were dreadful in the</v>

401
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:52.830
<v Speaker 3>first world war that they suffered a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very high rate of losses from when they </v>

402
00:19:52.961 --> 00:19:55.780
<v Speaker 3>fully joined the battle of the battle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

403
00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:56.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

404
00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the are gone,</v>

405
00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.730
<v Speaker 3>the [inaudible] gone region is </v>
<v Speaker 3>murderous.</v>

406
00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:05.970
<v Speaker 3>It's as murderous as any of the battle </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the first world war and considering </v>

407
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.470
<v Speaker 3>that they only really for full pelt for </v>
<v Speaker 3>three months,</v>

408
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.050
<v Speaker 3>the American casualties are worth </v>
<v Speaker 3>remembering.</v>

409
00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:16.530
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for one reason or another possibly </v>

410
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:16.790
<v Speaker 3>could say disengaged from Europe a bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

411
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.460
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the interwar years,</v>

412
00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:22.840
<v Speaker 3>the Americans have never really </v>
<v Speaker 3>remembered it in the same way as we do.</v>

413
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always try to imagine if the US had </v>

414
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:28.850
<v Speaker 2>fought for two years at those kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>casualty rates.</v>

415
00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

416
00:20:29.991 --> 00:20:32.180
<v Speaker 2>we'd have a few more war memorials </v>
<v Speaker 2>around here.</v>

417
00:20:32.181 --> 00:20:33.380
<v Speaker 2>Certainly would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

418
00:20:33.381 --> 00:20:34.580
<v Speaker 2>I think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

419
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.540
<v Speaker 2>contexts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

420
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:39.200
<v Speaker 2>if history teaches anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it helps us understand how things get to</v>

421
00:20:39.201 --> 00:20:41.990
<v Speaker 2>where they are and in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once again,</v>

422
00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:46.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll try to use in political </v>

423
00:20:46.991 --> 00:20:46.991
<v Speaker 2>discussions the lessons of history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

424
00:20:46.991 --> 00:20:51.281
<v Speaker 2>We know from the 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>38 appeasement stuff that you can't do </v>

425
00:20:51.281 --> 00:20:51.281
<v Speaker 2>this or that or the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

426
00:20:51.281 --> 00:20:53.230
<v Speaker 2>the classic misuse of the lessons of </v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

427
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.560
<v Speaker 2>but I always try to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to ask you for your </v>

428
00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:58.560
<v Speaker 2>opinion on this because you've read a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of stuff.</v>

429
00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.700
<v Speaker 2>The generation that gets accused of </v>
<v Speaker 2>really doing anything they could to </v>

430
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:07.291
<v Speaker 2>avoid another world war are the ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>that lived through it as younger people.</v>

431
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:12.660
<v Speaker 2>How did that scar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The leadership on both sides really in </v>

432
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.251
<v Speaker 2>the second world war as they sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>maneuvered jockeyed a threatened try to </v>

433
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:22.710
<v Speaker 2>avoid via compromise a repetition of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>worst thing any of them had ever lived </v>

434
00:21:23.291 --> 00:21:23.680
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

435
00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.680
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some truth in that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>not an expert,</v>

436
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:33.570
<v Speaker 3>but certainly that there was peace </v>
<v Speaker 3>movements in Britain and France for the </v>

437
00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:37.240
<v Speaker 3>French pretty broken by their awful </v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences,</v>

438
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:40.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] is the one that gets most of</v>

439
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:45.600
<v Speaker 3>the blame for what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was responding to a popular </v>

440
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.190
<v Speaker 3>element within the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see that they just were not willing to</v>

441
00:21:48.191 --> 00:21:49.420
<v Speaker 3>suffer it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

442
00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.950
<v Speaker 3>I'll have so much sympathy for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

443
00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:58.030
<v Speaker 3>the Germans of course also that you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>have less sympathy for them.</v>

444
00:21:58.031 --> 00:21:59.250
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

445
00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.940
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the British,</v>

446
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it took a while for us to get properly </v>

447
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:06.000
<v Speaker 3>into the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

448
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:06.670
<v Speaker 3>even in the second we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll,</v>

449
00:22:06.671 --> 00:22:07.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

450
00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:12.400
<v Speaker 3>the phony war and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people were trying to get that.</v>

451
00:22:12.401 --> 00:22:16.870
<v Speaker 3>There was an appeasement movement in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Britain right until Churchill took over.</v>

452
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:22.290
<v Speaker 3>And Churchill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for all his faults was the walnut </v>

453
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:25.300
<v Speaker 3>finally pinned the British into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a post in Nazi Germany in the long </v>

454
00:22:26.401 --> 00:22:31.401
<v Speaker 3>term because they were elements in </v>
<v Speaker 3>British society that we're perfectly </v>

455
00:22:31.401 --> 00:22:32.880
<v Speaker 3>happy to do a deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

456
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.950
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

457
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a complex period,</v>

458
00:22:36.671 --> 00:22:39.970
<v Speaker 3>which I am not an expert on at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your latest</v>

459
00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:43.230
<v Speaker 2>we'll call the last battle focuses on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

460
00:22:43.231 --> 00:22:48.231
<v Speaker 2>from a military history standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the most fascinating </v>

461
00:22:48.231 --> 00:22:51.920
<v Speaker 2>periods in the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to get lost in the burdens </v>

462
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.160
<v Speaker 2>and the psalms and the passion Dales and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

463
00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:58.470
<v Speaker 2>Talk a little bit about that era where </v>
<v Speaker 2>we go away from the iconic western front</v>

464
00:22:58.471 --> 00:22:58.830
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

465
00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:04.040
<v Speaker 2>of a stalemate on the front to open </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement again and something that looks </v>

466
00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.580
<v Speaker 2>like a prototype for 1939 warfare.</v>

467
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.970
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it certainly is.</v>

468
00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

469
00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:17.740
<v Speaker 3>everything changes with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the itch the allies come up with the </v>

470
00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:21.770
<v Speaker 3>alarms battle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is basically finding all the </v>

471
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:21.770
<v Speaker 3>different weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the artillery,</v>

472
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:24.740
<v Speaker 3>the gas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mass machine gun fire that tanks,</v>

473
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:27.560
<v Speaker 3>the aeroplanes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that light machine guns,</v>

474
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.080
<v Speaker 3>mortars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything together,</v>

475
00:23:30.081 --> 00:23:32.300
<v Speaker 3>working together with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

476
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:32.710
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

477
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:33.380
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

478
00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:36.920
<v Speaker 3>to overwhelm anything that Germans do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took a breakthrough.</v>

479
00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.910
<v Speaker 3>But also it's the difference that not </v>
<v Speaker 3>just attacking on one place,</v>

480
00:23:40.911 --> 00:23:44.030
<v Speaker 3>like at the summer pasture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to attack for attacks,</v>

481
00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.150
<v Speaker 3>for battles for days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He Americans go first,</v>

482
00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:52.320
<v Speaker 3>that then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the British and the Canadians then </v>

483
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:52.320
<v Speaker 3>and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the French,</v>

484
00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.860
<v Speaker 3>the Belgians and the British,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then finally the British again,</v>

485
00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:59.861
<v Speaker 3>and the French full battles for day is </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing the Germans.</v>

486
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:05.350
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason it's missed out and normally </v>

487
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.350
<v Speaker 3>book's finished roundabout the eighth of</v>
<v Speaker 3>August.</v>

488
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.860
<v Speaker 3>My own book on 1918,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very British victory,</v>

489
00:24:06.861 --> 00:24:08.030
<v Speaker 3>which was a bit of a job title.</v>

490
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.840
<v Speaker 3>I have to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why I did that.</v>

491
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:16.250
<v Speaker 3>I have got a sense of humor which does </v>
<v Speaker 3>come out at a parcel really normally.</v>

492
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:20.120
<v Speaker 3>And the point was that you sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you publish it.</v>

493
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.220
<v Speaker 3>If they say right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've had enough of them go to the top.</v>

494
00:24:22.221 --> 00:24:25.070
<v Speaker 3>Now we've had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what you tend to miss out.</v>

495
00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.880
<v Speaker 3>Even that book by me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

496
00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:32.000
<v Speaker 3>Mrs the last six weeks of the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I wanted to put that right with this</v>

497
00:24:32.001 --> 00:24:34.580
<v Speaker 3>because there are so many enormous </v>
<v Speaker 3>battles.</v>

498
00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:37.970
<v Speaker 3>Open warfare comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Open warfare is worse.</v>

499
00:24:37.971 --> 00:24:42.971
<v Speaker 3>The casualty figures get higher,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much higher because because you're in </v>

500
00:24:42.971 --> 00:24:44.720
<v Speaker 3>the open,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if something goes wrong,</v>

501
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:45.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

502
00:24:45.501 --> 00:24:49.970
<v Speaker 3>God is the British to go forward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>push through in a very modern fashion,</v>

503
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
<v Speaker 3>push through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ignore isolated pockets of resistance </v>

504
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.360
<v Speaker 3>there'll be dealt with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're an infantry soldier and </v>

505
00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:58.430
<v Speaker 3>you go past an isolated pocket of </v>
<v Speaker 3>resistance,</v>

506
00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:03.610
<v Speaker 3>you'll get killed and the inmates will </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well because they'll fire into your </v>

507
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:03.610
<v Speaker 3>flanks.</v>

508
00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.320
<v Speaker 3>Does she go by?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's efficient militarily,</v>

509
00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:11.321
<v Speaker 3>but it leads to huge casualties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a painful time for the British and </v>

510
00:25:11.321 --> 00:25:15.080
<v Speaker 3>the Americans who are learning at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same time and anyone,</v>

511
00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.720
<v Speaker 3>anyone who has insults,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the American,</v>

512
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:22.750
<v Speaker 3>the courage of the American troops on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Argon,</v>

513
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:26.690
<v Speaker 3>those battles is mad because if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>insult them,</v>

514
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.440
<v Speaker 3>you're insulting the British on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Somme and you're insulting the French in</v>

515
00:25:30.441 --> 00:25:35.441
<v Speaker 3>1914,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're insulting basically armies that </v>

516
00:25:35.441 --> 00:25:35.510
<v Speaker 3>don't know what's going to happen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

517
00:25:35.511 --> 00:25:40.511
<v Speaker 3>They haven't had a chance to learn and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think you don't learn this until </v>

518
00:25:40.511 --> 00:25:44.681
<v Speaker 3>you get right into the end of the war </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the Americans don't really get </v>

519
00:25:44.681 --> 00:25:45.060
<v Speaker 3>into the war until,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

520
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.840
<v Speaker 3>until September about September the </v>
<v Speaker 3>26th.</v>

521
00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:53.140
<v Speaker 3>That's when their wall really starts </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they attack the Argonne forest </v>

522
00:25:54.141 --> 00:25:55.430
<v Speaker 3>water place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

523
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.560
<v Speaker 3>I've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's murder,</v>

524
00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:03.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mentioned earlier and you just sort </v>

525
00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:03.210
<v Speaker 3>of opened the door to it again.</v>

526
00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:04.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the aspects,</v>

527
00:26:04.371 --> 00:26:09.371
<v Speaker 3>one of the opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the points of views on this </v>

528
00:26:09.371 --> 00:26:09.371
<v Speaker 3>subject that you're kind of known for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

529
00:26:09.371 --> 00:26:13.771
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd put you and I guess you would put </v>

530
00:26:13.771 --> 00:26:13.771
<v Speaker 3>yourself in the camp of those who look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

531
00:26:13.771 --> 00:26:14.660
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the performance of the generals,</v>

532
00:26:14.661 --> 00:26:19.010
<v Speaker 3>which of course famously some compared </v>
<v Speaker 3>to butchery to.</v>

533
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.520
<v Speaker 3>If I could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could sum it up maybe A.</v>

534
00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:26.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing pretty well considering what a</v>
<v Speaker 3>natural learning curve on,</v>

535
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:31.900
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a big technological revolution in </v>

536
00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:32.300
<v Speaker 3>military affairs like this one might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>

537
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.940
<v Speaker 3>is that fair to say that you think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've done a pretty good job?</v>

538
00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:39.970
<v Speaker 3>All things considered spot on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly some of the more advanced </v>

539
00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:41.900
<v Speaker 3>French and British general and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

540
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.680
<v Speaker 3>I stand by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

541
00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:48.780
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it makes me a puppet or in some </v>

542
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.171
<v Speaker 3>places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing about Haig was he was don't </v>

543
00:26:51.171 --> 00:26:54.141
<v Speaker 3>think of him as a general thinking of </v>
<v Speaker 3>him as a chief executive of a massive </v>

544
00:26:54.141 --> 00:26:54.141
<v Speaker 3>American Corporation.</v>

545
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.640
<v Speaker 3>Someone who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who provides direction,</v>

546
00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:01.200
<v Speaker 3>someone who brings things together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who enables or makes things happen.</v>

547
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:04.950
<v Speaker 3>If you think of him that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get in a much better idea of what he</v>

548
00:27:04.951 --> 00:27:09.951
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a commander in chief of five </v>

549
00:27:09.951 --> 00:27:10.390
<v Speaker 3>armies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no such thing as in,</v>

550
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:11.100
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

551
00:27:11.101 --> 00:27:12.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second World War.</v>

552
00:27:12.271 --> 00:27:13.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know each.</v>

553
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there people are supreme commanders,</v>

554
00:27:15.631 --> 00:27:20.631
<v Speaker 3>but they had people to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Politicians have to deal with our </v>

555
00:27:20.631 --> 00:27:23.331
<v Speaker 3>allies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't happen in the first world </v>

556
00:27:23.331 --> 00:27:23.331
<v Speaker 3>war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

557
00:27:23.331 --> 00:27:25.600
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who has to deal with all of them and it,</v>

558
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.740
<v Speaker 3>that's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they did come up and.</v>

559
00:27:28.741 --> 00:27:30.480
<v Speaker 3>But when it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Haig comes up with it,</v>

560
00:27:30.481 --> 00:27:35.160
<v Speaker 3>but it enables the system which allows </v>
<v Speaker 3>the all arms battle to function.</v>

561
00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.400
<v Speaker 3>And can I just want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a learning curve,</v>

562
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:44.010
<v Speaker 3>what it is is too big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deepest side by side and once the allies</v>

563
00:27:44.011 --> 00:27:49.011
<v Speaker 3>or the British,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were to look at it narrowly </v>

564
00:27:49.011 --> 00:27:50.780
<v Speaker 3>British or Americans and then the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>side is the Germans and for every new </v>

565
00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.020
<v Speaker 3>attacking method you bring in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Germans bringing a defensive attitude.</v>

566
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:59.300
<v Speaker 3>It's not a curve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go up and you go down and something </v>

567
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.751
<v Speaker 3>that works on Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might not work next Thursday because </v>

568
00:28:02.751 --> 00:28:02.970
<v Speaker 3>the Germans will have changed their </v>
<v Speaker 3>tactics.</v>

569
00:28:02.971 --> 00:28:06.360
<v Speaker 3>That's an analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not An exact timeframe obviously,</v>

570
00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.730
<v Speaker 3>but what I mean is it's constantly </v>
<v Speaker 3>changing.</v>

571
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:13.830
<v Speaker 3>So in 1951 trench line,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps one and a half.</v>

572
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.800
<v Speaker 3>Then later in that year there's three </v>
<v Speaker 3>trench lines.</v>

573
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:22.040
<v Speaker 3>By the year afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's three trench systems and then </v>

574
00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:26.130
<v Speaker 3>readouts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Soon after that you start to get the </v>

575
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:27.450
<v Speaker 3>pill is the underground block houses </v>
<v Speaker 3>where the troops can be kept safe.</v>

576
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:31.380
<v Speaker 3>You get different machine can tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the Germans are constantly changing.</v>

577
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.320
<v Speaker 3>Now we changed as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>British bringing tanks,</v>

578
00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:36.210
<v Speaker 3>are they great?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not First,</v>

579
00:28:36.211 --> 00:28:39.150
<v Speaker 3>but they're part of it that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>different tactics,</v>

580
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:43.050
<v Speaker 3>different infantry tactics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So both sides are changing,</v>

581
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.060
<v Speaker 3>enhance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you think of two big diapers,</v>

582
00:28:45.061 --> 00:28:46.980
<v Speaker 3>I think you call them something else in </v>
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>

583
00:28:46.981 --> 00:28:49.430
<v Speaker 3>but you know a little right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

584
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:54.440
<v Speaker 3>lots going up and down hills at running </v>
<v Speaker 3>side by side and you find out who's </v>

585
00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.960
<v Speaker 3>going to win a battle by where you are </v>
<v Speaker 3>in relation to the other side.</v>

586
00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:58.980
<v Speaker 3>Henson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Psalm,</v>

587
00:28:59.010 --> 00:28:59.850
<v Speaker 3>first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Psalm,</v>

588
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:01.280
<v Speaker 3>first day of the somme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>19th,</v>

589
00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:05.970
<v Speaker 3>six days were very low down there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got great trench systems,</v>

590
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:08.430
<v Speaker 3>great weapons of defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we,</v>

591
00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:08.960
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

592
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.070
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're an,</v>

593
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:14.250
<v Speaker 3>we don't know what we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all told by the end of the war,</v>

594
00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:19.490
<v Speaker 3>we really have learned to where the very</v>
<v Speaker 3>high end we're looking down on the </v>

595
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:20.890
<v Speaker 3>Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it is a complex system that,</v>

596
00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:21.860
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

597
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:22.500
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

598
00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.630
<v Speaker 3>Golden Corrigan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a British historian once said,</v>

599
00:29:24.631 --> 00:29:29.340
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't the generals killed up boys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the Germans and it's the same for</v>

600
00:29:29.341 --> 00:29:32.340
<v Speaker 3>your American lads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the Germans that did it.</v>

601
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:37.790
<v Speaker 3>And when we try and blame just our </v>
<v Speaker 3>generals or just our senior offices or </v>

602
00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:42.330
<v Speaker 3>blame our allies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not understanding what's </v>

603
00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.901
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're fighting a very complex war </v>

604
00:29:44.901 --> 00:29:47.350
<v Speaker 3>against the best army in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the biggest army in the world.</v>

605
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.550
<v Speaker 3>The Germans</v>

606
00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:53.980
<v Speaker 2>you wrote in your book that modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>warfare was just so damn complicated at </v>

607
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.470
<v Speaker 2>every level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

608
00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:57.980
<v Speaker 2>so let's talk about that for a minute </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it seems to me and I,</v>

609
00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously there were,</v>

610
00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.030
<v Speaker 2>there were earlier wars were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these changes happened,</v>

611
00:30:02.031 --> 00:30:04.610
<v Speaker 2>but so slowly that they may not have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been important.</v>

612
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:06.530
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me that the first world </v>
<v Speaker 2>wars,</v>

613
00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.060
<v Speaker 2>the first one where we get that very </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern sort of sense where technology is</v>

614
00:30:11.061 --> 00:30:16.061
<v Speaker 2>changing so quickly that it's not that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to learn the </v>

615
00:30:16.061 --> 00:30:17.240
<v Speaker 2>lessons of this war and adapt for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next war.</v>

616
00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:20.900
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to learn the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lessons of today's air combat,</v>

617
00:30:20.901 --> 00:30:25.901
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that in six months you have the </v>

618
00:30:25.901 --> 00:30:27.350
<v Speaker 2>newest discovery or the other side's </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna shoot your people out of the air.</v>

619
00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.390
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Second World War you saw this,</v>

620
00:30:29.391 --> 00:30:31.580
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this dynamic going on all the time.</v>

621
00:30:31.581 --> 00:30:36.581
<v Speaker 2>What's the latest tank?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the latest version of the </v>

622
00:30:36.581 --> 00:30:36.581
<v Speaker 2>airplane?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the first world war,</v>

623
00:30:36.581 --> 00:30:37.100
<v Speaker 2>it seems like that's the first time </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

624
00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:41.570
<v Speaker 2>that needing to learn on the fly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>adapt during the conflict becomes,</v>

625
00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.630
<v Speaker 2>well a war winning or a war losing </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially thing.</v>

626
00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:48.070
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's so quick.</v>

627
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:53.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the aircraft that took place before the </v>

628
00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.161
<v Speaker 3>battle of the somme,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the aircraft that took control of the </v>

629
00:30:56.161 --> 00:30:59.341
<v Speaker 3>air over the song were British and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there were things like the Idh to the </v>

630
00:31:00.011 --> 00:31:00.690
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

631
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

632
00:31:01.391 --> 00:31:01.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

633
00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:05.350
<v Speaker 3>the fee to be that the sopwith strutter </v>
<v Speaker 3>by God,</v>

634
00:31:05.351 --> 00:31:10.270
<v Speaker 3>there were names to conjure with them </v>
<v Speaker 3>camels 17.</v>

635
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.490
<v Speaker 3>That's later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they took control.</v>

636
00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:17.590
<v Speaker 3>They will outclass totally by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Albatross just three months later,</v>

637
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:22.690
<v Speaker 3>three months now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People like me still think that the,</v>

638
00:31:22.691 --> 00:31:23.110
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

639
00:31:23.111 --> 00:31:25.120
<v Speaker 3>the whole carrier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a decent aircraft,</v>

640
00:31:25.121 --> 00:31:29.050
<v Speaker 3>that's 19 fifties technology that flew </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the sixties,</v>

641
00:31:29.051 --> 00:31:31.440
<v Speaker 3>seventies and eighties and has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>outdated now.</v>

642
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:35.470
<v Speaker 3>Best part of 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then it was months,</v>

643
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:38.440
<v Speaker 3>just months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you could be flying an aircraft that</v>

644
00:31:38.441 --> 00:31:40.570
<v Speaker 3>was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now he's useless.</v>

645
00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.720
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a death trap when you meet </v>

646
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:45.720
<v Speaker 3>something better.</v>

647
00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:45.820
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I find,</v>

648
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:50.590
<v Speaker 3>and I think that there is a warfare as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>catalyst for change,</v>

649
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:55.830
<v Speaker 3>you get generals or people like generals</v>
<v Speaker 3>who defined the need and then you get to</v>

650
00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:00.070
<v Speaker 3>a scientist who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who do the thinking,</v>

651
00:32:00.071 --> 00:32:03.700
<v Speaker 3>who work out the theory of how to meet </v>
<v Speaker 3>that need and then you have a,</v>

652
00:32:03.701 --> 00:32:08.701
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the practical men that they're </v>

653
00:32:08.701 --> 00:32:10.300
<v Speaker 3>engineers are practical soldiers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they work at it to actually do it,</v>

654
00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:12.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to fix that camera to an airplane,</v>

655
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:13.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to,</v>

656
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody else works at the focal lengths</v>

657
00:32:16.331 --> 00:32:19.450
<v Speaker 3>and everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but someone has to work it out.</v>

658
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:24.600
<v Speaker 3>You get the theory of a synchronization </v>
<v Speaker 3>machine so you can shoot through the </v>

659
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.990
<v Speaker 3>propeller or not through the propeller </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you see what I mean,</v>

660
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:31.330
<v Speaker 3>that the theories very well and good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you need practical mentor,</v>

661
00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:36.510
<v Speaker 3>make it work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And warfare drives along technological </v>

662
00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:37.750
<v Speaker 3>change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A bit like in the sixties,</v>

663
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:38.830
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I might,</v>

664
00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.710
<v Speaker 3>although it's not my subject a bit like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the space race did the same,</v>

665
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:48.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>driving along technological change </v>

666
00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:48.350
<v Speaker 3>because someone's defined a very real </v>
<v Speaker 3>need.</v>

667
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then to bow tie this with what we </v>

668
00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.340
<v Speaker 2>just talked about and then somebody from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the military hierarchy has to figure out</v>

669
00:32:54.341 --> 00:32:58.180
<v Speaker 2>how it all fits together operationally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're the CEO,</v>

670
00:32:58.181 --> 00:33:00.550
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a guy like Douglas Haig,</v>

671
00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:03.820
<v Speaker 2>you have to remember that it's a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to factor in all this,</v>

672
00:33:03.821 --> 00:33:06.280
<v Speaker 2>what we would call today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>high tech stuff.</v>

673
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.910
<v Speaker 2>Who was a cavalry officer born in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mid 19th century.</v>

674
00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.520
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a buddy.</v>

675
00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.690
<v Speaker 3>He was known as he educated soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was saying,</v>

676
00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:16.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you read,</v>

677
00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:19.370
<v Speaker 3>you can find a quote for everything if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you look through the thing,</v>

678
00:33:19.371 --> 00:33:20.200
<v Speaker 3>so you'll find,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

679
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:25.200
<v Speaker 3>but he was an enthusiast for machine </v>
<v Speaker 3>guns eight to has a problem,</v>

680
00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.360
<v Speaker 3>a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's often too keen on new weapons,</v>

681
00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:29.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

682
00:33:29.441 --> 00:33:30.160
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

683
00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:31.180
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

684
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.470
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't realize that.</v>

685
00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that he doesn't realize,</v>

686
00:33:34.601 --> 00:33:36.690
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes he doesn't appreciate </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

687
00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.680
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you have to bed them in.</v>

688
00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:43.890
<v Speaker 3>There's no point building 300 tanks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sending them forward if you don't know </v>

689
00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:44.680
<v Speaker 3>how to drive them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which we didn't in 1968.</v>

690
00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.410
<v Speaker 3>It's only 1917.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We knew how they worked,</v>

691
00:33:47.411 --> 00:33:48.730
<v Speaker 3>how the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to use them in action,</v>

692
00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:51.160
<v Speaker 3>how to fit them in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the all arms battle,</v>

693
00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:52.990
<v Speaker 3>the what's going on is very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

694
00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:57.970
<v Speaker 3>I may be a British term or it may be an </v>
<v Speaker 3>American term that we used,</v>

695
00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:00.700
<v Speaker 3>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could not have recognized this term,</v>

696
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.010
<v Speaker 3>but best practice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

697
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:06.630
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time the British army is engaged</v>

698
00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.160
<v Speaker 3>in something called best practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't know what that meant,</v>

699
00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.810
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look at a battle,</v>

700
00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.300
<v Speaker 3>what worked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what didn't best practice.</v>

701
00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:18.330
<v Speaker 3>They then disseminate in a series of </v>
<v Speaker 3>pamphlets called the SS unfortunately </v>

702
00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:20.880
<v Speaker 3>with our perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but ss pamphlets,</v>

703
00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:24.070
<v Speaker 3>a those pamphlets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to do this,</v>

704
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:27.640
<v Speaker 3>how to use a tank in battle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to use a louis machine guns,</v>

705
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:30.130
<v Speaker 3>how to make an attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to do this,</v>

706
00:34:30.131 --> 00:34:31.900
<v Speaker 3>how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>

707
00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.570
<v Speaker 3>this is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

708
00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:38.620
<v Speaker 3>this is just the stuff of modern warfare</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it takes staff officers.</v>

709
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:40.660
<v Speaker 3>It takes generals and it takes someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

710
00:34:40.661 --> 00:34:41.740
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the top,</v>

711
00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:42.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

712
00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:43.940
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to co ordinate.</v>

713
00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.440
<v Speaker 3>He's not a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not the Polian.</v>

714
00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:51.830
<v Speaker 3>It's probably not even Wellington,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what he is is a driven individual </v>

715
00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:51.830
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

716
00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:55.480
<v Speaker 3>whose mind for one reason is it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect staff officer mind,</v>

717
00:34:55.690 --> 00:35:00.690
<v Speaker 3>a combination of detail Dr and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guts to set a direction,</v>

718
00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:05.320
<v Speaker 3>a direction which is painful to many of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the men who served for it.</v>

719
00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:07.840
<v Speaker 2>When you're reading the histories too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

720
00:35:07.841 --> 00:35:12.841
<v Speaker 2>it's so funny because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'll churchill is a perfect </v>

721
00:35:12.841 --> 00:35:15.241
<v Speaker 2>example of someone who will push this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you mentioned it with Hashtag to </v>

722
00:35:15.241 --> 00:35:18.001
<v Speaker 2>where you can see that the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>use this new technology is to sort of </v>

723
00:35:18.001 --> 00:35:21.190
<v Speaker 2>surprise the other side with it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit from the shock value.</v>

724
00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.790
<v Speaker 2>But as you just pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is,</v>

725
00:35:23.791 --> 00:35:26.890
<v Speaker 2>is that you don't know how to use it </v>
<v Speaker 2>until you've used it a few times.</v>

726
00:35:26.891 --> 00:35:31.891
<v Speaker 2>And then by then of course the Germans </v>
<v Speaker 2>have started responding with </v>

727
00:35:31.891 --> 00:35:31.891
<v Speaker 2>countermeasures and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

728
00:35:31.891 --> 00:35:32.800
<v Speaker 2>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

729
00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:37.830
<v Speaker 2>was it churchill talked about using the </v>
<v Speaker 2>tanks when they first appeared in pin </v>

730
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:41.550
<v Speaker 2>pricks as opposed to some giant battle </v>
<v Speaker 2>where a thousand of them overwhelmed the</v>

731
00:35:41.551 --> 00:35:42.780
<v Speaker 2>front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as you pointed out,</v>

732
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.990
<v Speaker 2>if that was the first time you ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>really employed them,</v>

733
00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.580
<v Speaker 2>would it have been effective at all?</v>

734
00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:51.070
<v Speaker 3>That I'd like to take?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

735
00:35:51.071 --> 00:35:55.300
<v Speaker 3>That's a great exam because the 15th of </v>
<v Speaker 3>September is the first tank attack.</v>

736
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:59.080
<v Speaker 3>A three quarters of them broke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm rubbish at statistics.</v>

737
00:35:59.081 --> 00:36:00.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that kind of historic,</v>

738
00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:06.050
<v Speaker 3>but let's just take the broad brush.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three quarters or two thirds of them </v>

739
00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:08.020
<v Speaker 3>broke down and never got to the front.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd left gaps in the barrage,</v>

740
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:13.390
<v Speaker 3>the creeping barrage which run forward </v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of the infantry for the tanks </v>

741
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 3>when they weren't there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the infantry didn't have any artillery </v>

742
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:17.410
<v Speaker 3>support.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in front of them they got lost.</v>

743
00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:22.590
<v Speaker 3>They had at the wheels because I thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>they needed wheels at the back to steer </v>

744
00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:27.070
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had no idea how to communicate </v>

745
00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:27.250
<v Speaker 3>between themselves and the infantry when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go into action.</v>

746
00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:30.280
<v Speaker 3>To be absolutely honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are several,</v>

747
00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:35.520
<v Speaker 3>several historians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cynical historically think the tanks </v>

748
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.550
<v Speaker 3>probably killed more British troops in </v>
<v Speaker 3>German troops that day.</v>

749
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:37.840
<v Speaker 3>Now that is more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

750
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

751
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.090
<v Speaker 3>what we call an outlier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

752
00:36:40.091 --> 00:36:41.770
<v Speaker 3>it's more just a point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>robin,</v>

753
00:36:41.771 --> 00:36:44.890
<v Speaker 3>the serious remark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the point,</v>

754
00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:53.170
<v Speaker 3>what do you have the slightest how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>use the tanks inaction and we didn't </v>

755
00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:56.190
<v Speaker 3>have until home bright now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

756
00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:01.280
<v Speaker 3>which is a 1978 in 1970 a year and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of months later,</v>

757
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:08.360
<v Speaker 3>if we'd sent a thousand tanks as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were on the 15th to September 1916 over </v>

758
00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.150
<v Speaker 3>the top,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would have been.</v>

759
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

760
00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.360
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

761
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:18.510
<v Speaker 2>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're getting some glitches on this </v>

762
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:18.510
<v Speaker 2>end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not wonderful.</v>

763
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:18.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so talk to me,</v>

764
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:20.630
<v Speaker 2>talk to me a little bit if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the,</v>

765
00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:25.660
<v Speaker 2>the difference that for years has made </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time this book that you put out </v>

766
00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.870
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last battle is focusing on this.</v>

767
00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:31.820
<v Speaker 2>The governments of all these countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>are fundamentally transformed.</v>

768
00:37:31.821 --> 00:37:33.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imperial,</v>

769
00:37:33.591 --> 00:37:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Russia has gone by this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Austria,</v>

770
00:37:36.051 --> 00:37:39.890
<v Speaker 2>Hungary is shattered and looking for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way out of the war behind the scenes.</v>

771
00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:45.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>France has endured some serious troop </v>

772
00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.430
<v Speaker 2>morale problems in the not too distant </v>
<v Speaker 2>past.</v>

773
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.880
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's traditionally like the finest </v>

774
00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.970
<v Speaker 2>army in the world and Britain has gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the greatest creditor nation to one</v>

775
00:37:52.971 --> 00:37:55.280
<v Speaker 2>that is transferring their debt to New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York.</v>

776
00:37:55.281 --> 00:37:57.380
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference between the armies</v>

777
00:37:57.381 --> 00:38:02.381
<v Speaker 2>of 1914 in the governments that support </v>
<v Speaker 2>them versus these armies of early 1918 </v>

778
00:38:02.751 --> 00:38:05.240
<v Speaker 2>and the governments that support and </v>
<v Speaker 2>direct them?</v>

779
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:09.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the non toll tina armies would have been</v>

780
00:38:09.551 --> 00:38:12.640
<v Speaker 3>recognizable by Napoleon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The tactics,</v>

781
00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:17.760
<v Speaker 3>the way that we used would have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognizable from Napoleon from 100 </v>

782
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.051
<v Speaker 3>years before they've got modern weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they had no idea how to use the </v>

783
00:38:22.051 --> 00:38:24.130
<v Speaker 3>governments were old fashioned </v>
<v Speaker 3>governments.</v>

784
00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:29.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean I know Britain best but so I'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>use him as an example.</v>

785
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:33.550
<v Speaker 3>Lloyd George is Berry Berry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Different prep from,</v>

786
00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:37.750
<v Speaker 3>from asquith.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The who led the government asked with is</v>

787
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:43.500
<v Speaker 3>not particularly competencies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apply Towel gentlemen drinks far too </v>

788
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:43.620
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Squiffy asquith.</v>

789
00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:45.970
<v Speaker 3>Lloyd George has many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many faults.</v>

790
00:38:45.971 --> 00:38:50.971
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need a few more men to really </v>

791
00:38:50.971 --> 00:38:53.071
<v Speaker 3>encompasses many faults,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he is driven and you don't have to </v>

792
00:38:53.681 --> 00:38:56.170
<v Speaker 3>hate Lloyd George just because you like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

793
00:38:56.630 --> 00:39:00.520
<v Speaker 3>they would chalk and cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they both did their bit.</v>

794
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:05.470
<v Speaker 3>Lloyd George was a classic wall leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He provided civilian direction.</v>

795
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:08.860
<v Speaker 3>His idea of what to do with soldiers was</v>
<v Speaker 3>madness and he.</v>

796
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.580
<v Speaker 3>He did not help the direction of the war</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a strategic level,</v>

797
00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:16.000
<v Speaker 3>but on a sort of global level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He provided the drive,</v>

798
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:20.590
<v Speaker 3>but Britain was running out of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was running out of resources.</v>

799
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:23.080
<v Speaker 3>It was running out of troops and and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

800
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:28.100
<v Speaker 3>and it was running out of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The war had to be finished in 18 and </v>

801
00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:32.311
<v Speaker 3>that's one thing that hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>realized he was desperate to have </v>

802
00:39:32.311 --> 00:39:35.191
<v Speaker 3>finished the war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to give the Germans and no other </v>

803
00:39:35.191 --> 00:39:36.490
<v Speaker 3>chance to provide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to dig another set of trench lines,</v>

804
00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:38.530
<v Speaker 3>shortened perhaps say from</v>

805
00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:43.960
<v Speaker 3>because that's what they really hate and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fear that they have to get them.</v>

806
00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:45.170
<v Speaker 3>The war finished.</v>

807
00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:47.060
<v Speaker 4>Frank,</v>

808
00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:53.830
<v Speaker 3>you had a revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that wasn't a revolution in </v>

809
00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:55.060
<v Speaker 3>France.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know there wasn't one in Britain,</v>

810
00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:58.030
<v Speaker 3>but they could have been and people were</v>
<v Speaker 3>very aware of that.</v>

811
00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:04.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those governments that would have made </v>

812
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:07.100
<v Speaker 2>it into 1919 if the war we're continuing</v>
<v Speaker 2>might've had problems on the allied side</v>

813
00:40:07.101 --> 00:40:08.000
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not just the,</v>

814
00:40:08.001 --> 00:40:08.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

815
00:40:08.551 --> 00:40:09.590
<v Speaker 2>the central powers.</v>

816
00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:12.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

817
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:13.920
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

818
00:40:13.921 --> 00:40:16.560
<v Speaker 3>wall weariness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just,</v>

819
00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:18.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an incredible,</v>

820
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:21.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no money that now men,</v>

821
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:24.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's depressed.</v>

822
00:40:24.461 --> 00:40:25.010
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

823
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:26.360
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

824
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.390
<v Speaker 3>an awful thing to be involved in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

825
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:34.510
<v Speaker 3>countries are struggling and we needed </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lloyd George to provide the leadership </v>

826
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:37.090
<v Speaker 3>at the center and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the determination to fight on,</v>

827
00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:41.180
<v Speaker 3>to make sure that the would be beaten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

828
00:40:41.181 --> 00:40:43.620
<v Speaker 3>it's so easy just to give up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

829
00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.660
<v Speaker 3>to just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

830
00:40:44.661 --> 00:40:49.661
<v Speaker 3>we'll come to some compromise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the leaders like Lloyd George would </v>

831
00:40:49.661 --> 00:40:49.790
<v Speaker 3>not accept that.</v>

832
00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:53.850
<v Speaker 2>I think that's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

833
00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:58.851
<v Speaker 2>did I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there something about the new book </v>

834
00:40:58.851 --> 00:40:59.280
<v Speaker 2>that I didn't ask you about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is worth pointing out?</v>

835
00:40:59.281 --> 00:40:59.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

836
00:40:59.671 --> 00:41:02.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find it not just fascinating,</v>

837
00:41:02.011 --> 00:41:05.640
<v Speaker 2>but it's a little like discovering that </v>
<v Speaker 2>a band and you thought you'd heard every</v>

838
00:41:05.641 --> 00:41:10.641
<v Speaker 2>song from them had a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>songs you didn't know about and they're </v>

839
00:41:10.641 --> 00:41:13.910
<v Speaker 2>bigger and more interesting than you </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever knew other than not being able to </v>

840
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:15.030
<v Speaker 2>pronounce all of the battlefields and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wonderful.</v>

841
00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that wonderful?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last push in France.</v>

842
00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:19.960
<v Speaker 2>What about that last book have we not </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about that you think is.</v>

843
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:21.540
<v Speaker 2>It is especially compelling.</v>

844
00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:27.380
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what the thing for me is </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an emotional response,</v>

845
00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.010
<v Speaker 3>which I think you'll appreciate this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just A.</v>

846
00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.890
<v Speaker 3>It's the essence of the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've been fighting for years,</v>

847
00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:38.891
<v Speaker 3>say you're a soldier in those trenches </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've been fighting for for years and </v>

848
00:41:38.891 --> 00:41:40.670
<v Speaker 3>just as start to think it's coming to an</v>
<v Speaker 3>end,</v>

849
00:41:40.671 --> 00:41:44.660
<v Speaker 3>it's come into them and then you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to go forward.</v>

850
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:49.470
<v Speaker 3>You have to go into the attack and not </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody do.</v>

851
00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.950
<v Speaker 3>You recognize her Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called shell hole.</v>

852
00:41:51.951 --> 00:41:54.230
<v Speaker 3>Drop it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't all drop out.</v>

853
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:58.370
<v Speaker 3>You know you can't all fall back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep keep behind.</v>

854
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:03.850
<v Speaker 3>You just have to keep going with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>mates and the temptation to shirk in </v>

855
00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:07.250
<v Speaker 3>those final attacks in the final days </v>
<v Speaker 3>must have been enormous,</v>

856
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:12.200
<v Speaker 3>but somehow most found from somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the inner resolve which,</v>

857
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:17.290
<v Speaker 3>which people are made just can't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>grasp or understand because it's beyond </v>

858
00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:18.320
<v Speaker 3>our experience to finish the job.</v>

859
00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:21.920
<v Speaker 3>Generally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the worst of all for that.</v>

860
00:42:21.921 --> 00:42:24.140
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not just saying this because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're American.</v>

861
00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:30.070
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as pershing forced the final attack on </v>

862
00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:30.110
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

863
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:31.490
<v Speaker 3>the night of the 10th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>11th,</v>

864
00:42:31.491 --> 00:42:35.340
<v Speaker 3>and even the morning of the 11th and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

865
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.790
<v Speaker 3>the Americans had nearly 3000 </v>
<v Speaker 3>casualties.</v>

866
00:42:37.791 --> 00:42:42.791
<v Speaker 3>I'm rubbish on that final 24 hours and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just imagine what was going through </v>

867
00:42:43.821 --> 00:42:48.821
<v Speaker 3>their heads when they were told.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the Marines who were told they </v>

868
00:42:48.821 --> 00:42:50.570
<v Speaker 3>had to cross the mers in a lead foot </v>
<v Speaker 3>wide river,</v>

869
00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:54.050
<v Speaker 3>which Germans with machine guns on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other side and just,</v>

870
00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:59.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what went through their head and that's </v>

871
00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:02.621
<v Speaker 3>the last thing I'd like to say about </v>
<v Speaker 3>just just put yourself there and think </v>

872
00:43:02.621 --> 00:43:06.281
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why I liked your book so much </v>

873
00:43:06.281 --> 00:43:07.640
<v Speaker 3>because you do such a great job of </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving me the chance to do that.</v>

874
00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:12.820
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll try to sell you a few books this </v>

875
00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:14.621
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope you'll come on the next time you </v>

876
00:43:14.621 --> 00:43:14.621
<v Speaker 3>have one and I hope you'll write a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

877
00:43:14.621 --> 00:43:14.780
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to.</v>

878
00:43:14.781 --> 00:43:16.460
<v Speaker 3>I've really enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very.</v>

879
00:43:16.461 --> 00:43:17.570
<v Speaker 3>Had a great time with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

880
00:43:17.571 --> 00:43:18.710
<v Speaker 3>meeting heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take care.</v>

881
00:43:18.711 --> 00:43:20.770
<v Speaker 3>And thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Que Ca.</v>

882
00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.130
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my apologies for the,</v>

883
00:43:23.131 --> 00:43:24.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>digital glitches there.</v>

884
00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will try to figure out a better </v>

885
00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:29.570
<v Speaker 1>method.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do want to encourage you,</v>

886
00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:31.920
<v Speaker 1>if you are a fan or interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war to get Mr Hartz books.</v>

887
00:43:31.921 --> 00:43:36.921
<v Speaker 1>The Great War is absolutely a classic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is One on the naval battle of Jutland in</v>

888
00:43:37.141 --> 00:43:40.090
<v Speaker 1>1916.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Follows the same pattern with his,</v>

889
00:43:40.091 --> 00:43:45.091
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>context punctuated by oral historian </v>

890
00:43:45.091 --> 00:43:45.660
<v Speaker 1>quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works so well.</v>

891
00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote one on passion Dale,</v>

892
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:49.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

893
00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:50.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

894
00:43:50.071 --> 00:43:51.480
<v Speaker 1>probably awful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>muddy,</v>

895
00:43:51.481 --> 00:43:55.560
<v Speaker 1>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody symbolic of the whole war at that</v>

896
00:43:55.561 --> 00:43:57.900
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the new book,</v>

897
00:43:57.901 --> 00:43:59.130
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last battle,</v>

898
00:43:59.131 --> 00:44:04.131
<v Speaker 1>which focuses on the less well known but</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderous time period in the war and the</v>

899
00:44:05.071 --> 00:44:10.071
<v Speaker 1>phase of the first world war where </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone got into the trenches and </v>

900
00:44:10.071 --> 00:44:13.071
<v Speaker 1>started moving again and began to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kinds of casualties that reminded </v>

901
00:44:13.071 --> 00:44:16.650
<v Speaker 1>them why they first dug into the ground </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first place.</v>

902
00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an addendum,</v>

903
00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.120
<v Speaker 1>a couple of things worth noting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

904
00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.670
<v Speaker 1>at the very end of the conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Hart,</v>

905
00:44:23.671 --> 00:44:27.150
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about pershing and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying things like,</v>

906
00:44:27.151 --> 00:44:29.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the 10th or even on the 11th,</v>

907
00:44:29.011 --> 00:44:30.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was launching these offensives,</v>

908
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:32.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a little explanation.</v>

909
00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:35.910
<v Speaker 1>The 10th and the 11th or the November </v>
<v Speaker 1>10th and November,</v>

910
00:44:35.911 --> 00:44:36.780
<v Speaker 1>11th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

911
00:44:36.781 --> 00:44:40.350
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day before and the day of the end of</v>

912
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:42.690
<v Speaker 1>the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the armistice taking effect.</v>

913
00:44:42.691 --> 00:44:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

914
00:44:44.611 --> 00:44:47.130
<v Speaker 1>at this hour on this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to stop shooting.</v>

915
00:44:47.131 --> 00:44:48.400
<v Speaker 1>So everybody knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

916
00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:51.060
<v Speaker 1>the war ends tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the war ends today.</v>

917
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:56.510
<v Speaker 1>So how much does it bother you as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldier in the trenches?</v>

918
00:44:57.031 --> 00:45:02.031
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not even in the trenches at that </v>

919
00:45:02.031 --> 00:45:03.951
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaning up against a broken down old </v>

920
00:45:03.951 --> 00:45:06.861
<v Speaker 1>French brick house in a ruined French </v>
<v Speaker 1>building behind a tank as you're </v>

921
00:45:06.861 --> 00:45:11.451
<v Speaker 1>prepared to move forward to find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that your general wants to launch an </v>

922
00:45:11.451 --> 00:45:15.711
<v Speaker 1>offensive that's going to cost a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your lives in the last 24 hours of the </v>

923
00:45:15.711 --> 00:45:18.150
<v Speaker 1>war or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what he was talking about.</v>

924
00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:25.160
<v Speaker 1>You might think in your head of reasons </v>
<v Speaker 1>why a general might want to do something</v>

925
00:45:25.201 --> 00:45:27.720
<v Speaker 1>like that and play with your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations for a minute.</v>

926
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing I wanted to quote was we</v>

927
00:45:31.501 --> 00:45:36.501
<v Speaker 1>had mentioned that in the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his famous series on the Second World </v>

928
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:38.700
<v Speaker 1>War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even call it a history.</v>

929
00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:43.860
<v Speaker 1>You should call it almost like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal account from a participant.</v>

930
00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Churchill's history of the Second </v>

931
00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:49.350
<v Speaker 1>World War has a wonderful start to at </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he kind of talks about.</v>

932
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:51.810
<v Speaker 1>He sort of picks up at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war,</v>

933
00:45:51.811 --> 00:45:56.811
<v Speaker 1>which when you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a bad way to write the </v>

934
00:45:56.811 --> 00:45:56.811
<v Speaker 1>histories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he talks about,</v>

935
00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:58.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war ending,</v>

936
00:45:58.501 --> 00:46:03.501
<v Speaker 1>when it did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what was going to happen if it </v>

937
00:46:03.501 --> 00:46:03.501
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right what,</v>

938
00:46:03.501 --> 00:46:06.090
<v Speaker 1>what the plan was for 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

939
00:46:06.091 --> 00:46:08.010
<v Speaker 1>and of course the war ends in 1918,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

940
00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:09.090
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Churchill says,</v>

941
00:46:09.091 --> 00:46:10.620
<v Speaker 1>if 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 happened,</v>

942
00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:13.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was going to unleash terrorists,</v>

943
00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:17.610
<v Speaker 1>unlike any of the world had ever seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill writes quote.</v>

944
00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:23.180
<v Speaker 1>But all that happened in the four years </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Great War was only a prelude to </v>

945
00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:27.951
<v Speaker 1>what was preparing for the fifth year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The campaign of the year in 1919 would </v>

946
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:33.230
<v Speaker 1>have witnessed an immense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a session to the powers of destruction </v>

947
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:36.210
<v Speaker 1>of the Germans retain the morale to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>good their retreat to the Rhine.</v>

948
00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:41.480
<v Speaker 1>They would have been assaulted in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>summer of 1919 with forces and by </v>

949
00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.940
<v Speaker 1>methods in comparatively more prodigious</v>
<v Speaker 1>than any yet employed.</v>

950
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of airplanes would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>shattered their cities.</v>

951
00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:53.450
<v Speaker 1>Scores of thousands of Canon would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>blasted their front arrangements were </v>

952
00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:57.771
<v Speaker 1>being made to carry simultaneously a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter of a million men together with </v>

953
00:46:57.771 --> 00:47:02.691
<v Speaker 1>all their requirements continuously </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward across country in mechanical </v>

954
00:47:02.691 --> 00:47:07.161
<v Speaker 1>vehicles moving 10 or 15 miles each day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poison gasses of incredible malignity </v>

955
00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:13.440
<v Speaker 1>against which only a secret mask which </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans could not obtain in time was</v>

956
00:47:13.441 --> 00:47:18.441
<v Speaker 1>proof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have stifled all resistance and </v>

957
00:47:18.441 --> 00:47:20.070
<v Speaker 1>paralyzed all life on the hostile front </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjected to attack,</v>

958
00:47:20.490 --> 00:47:25.490
<v Speaker 1>no doubt the Germans to had their plans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the hour of wrath had passed.</v>

959
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:31.190
<v Speaker 1>The signal of relief was given and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrors of 1919 remain buried in the </v>

960
00:47:31.541 --> 00:47:34.870
<v Speaker 1>archives of the great antagonists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

961
00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:41.300
<v Speaker 1>and it's worth pointing out that even </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the terrible and horrible </v>

962
00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:44.931
<v Speaker 1>destruction of the Second World War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were some of the horrors of the </v>

963
00:47:44.931 --> 00:47:49.761
<v Speaker 1>first that we're not revisited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems counterintuitive to human </v>

964
00:47:50.521 --> 00:47:51.480
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

965
00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:57.020
<v Speaker 1>This idea that in total war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings would use every single </v>

966
00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:01.350
<v Speaker 1>weapon at their disposal to fend off </v>
<v Speaker 1>total destruction.</v>

967
00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Yet those leaders in the Second World </v>
<v Speaker 1>War who themselves were younger people </v>

968
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:12.411
<v Speaker 1>who fought in the first and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced that somehow managed to not </v>

969
00:48:12.511 --> 00:48:16.980
<v Speaker 1>use poison gas again on a wide scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

970
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what conclusions you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>draw from that,</v>

971
00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:22.840
<v Speaker 1>but it's an interesting variable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider,</v>

972
00:48:22.841 --> 00:48:23.230
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

973
00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had mentioned a,</v>

974
00:48:26.221 --> 00:48:31.221
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a note specifically that it's stuck in </v>

975
00:48:31.221 --> 00:48:33.801
<v Speaker 1>my mind and it obviously stuck in I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Hearts buying to from a soldier </v>

976
00:48:34.501 --> 00:48:39.501
<v Speaker 1>that was writing his turns out to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>last note home to his family and it </v>

977
00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:45.250
<v Speaker 1>exemplifies the way heart tends to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he will write a piece that sets up</v>

978
00:48:46.081 --> 00:48:49.710
<v Speaker 1>this emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an exclamation point and then deliver it</v>

979
00:48:49.711 --> 00:48:51.660
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just stayed.</v>

980
00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:55.830
<v Speaker 1>We used it blueprint for armageddon </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it is so emotionally powerful.</v>

981
00:48:56.220 --> 00:49:01.220
<v Speaker 1>So here's what heart rights he's talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this battle at the song which he </v>

982
00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:04.911
<v Speaker 1>referenced in the interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that terrible British day where they've </v>

983
00:49:04.911 --> 00:49:06.150
<v Speaker 1>figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

984
00:49:06.151 --> 00:49:08.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't working the way we thought,</v>

985
00:49:08.581 --> 00:49:10.590
<v Speaker 1>and meanwhile we're trying to figure it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the open,</v>

986
00:49:10.591 --> 00:49:13.080
<v Speaker 1>under machine gun fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind a lot of barbed wire.</v>

987
00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:18.620
<v Speaker 1>And he says that the soldiers about to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go on this attack would write these </v>

988
00:49:18.961 --> 00:49:20.580
<v Speaker 1>letters home to their families</v>

989
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:25.060
<v Speaker 1>and here's what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he quotes the powerful letter.</v>

990
00:49:25.061 --> 00:49:26.530
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is from his book,</v>

991
00:49:26.531 --> 00:49:28.000
<v Speaker 1>the Great War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

992
00:49:28.001 --> 00:49:31.150
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the final reports from the front,</v>

993
00:49:31.180 --> 00:49:36.180
<v Speaker 1>meaning of the Somme battle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>filtered back to the British high </v>

994
00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:36.760
<v Speaker 1>command,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were generally positive in tone.</v>

995
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Overall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the visual impression of the barrage </v>

996
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.400
<v Speaker 1>proved far more devastating than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth on the ground.</v>

997
00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:47.700
<v Speaker 1>British progress had been more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>discounted by German improvements in </v>

998
00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:51.481
<v Speaker 1>their defenses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was not known at the time on </v>

999
00:49:51.481 --> 00:49:51.670
<v Speaker 1>the British side of the wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>

1000
00:49:51.671 --> 00:49:56.671
<v Speaker 1>they had no choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The offensive had to go ahead is the </v>

1001
00:49:56.671 --> 00:49:59.170
<v Speaker 1>future of the alliance with France </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on it in the last few hours as</v>

1002
00:49:59.171 --> 00:50:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Hague's men prepared for the ordeal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many wrote their sad last letters.</v>

1003
00:50:03.671 --> 00:50:08.671
<v Speaker 1>Home one was so beautifully expressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it exemplifies the feelings of men </v>

1004
00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:13.420
<v Speaker 1>trapped and tormented by the conflicting</v>
<v Speaker 1>calls of country and family.</v>

1005
00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Now he's quoting an original letter </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

1006
00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:19.510
<v Speaker 1>I must not allow myself to dwell on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal.</v>

1007
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.730
<v Speaker 1>There's no room for it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

1008
00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:25.600
<v Speaker 1>it is demoralizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do not want to die.</v>

1009
00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Not that I mind for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it'd be that I am to go,</v>

1010
00:50:29.451 --> 00:50:32.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thought that I may never see you</v>

1011
00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.930
<v Speaker 1>or are darling baby again turns my </v>
<v Speaker 1>bowels to water.</v>

1012
00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:39.320
<v Speaker 1>I cannot think of it with even the </v>
<v Speaker 1>semblance of equanimity.</v>

1013
00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:43.700
<v Speaker 1>My one constellation is the happiness </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has been ours.</v>

1014
00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my conscience is clear that I've always </v>

1015
00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:51.500
<v Speaker 1>tried to make life a joy to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know at least that if I go he will not</v>

1016
00:50:51.501 --> 00:50:53.210
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is something,</v>

1017
00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:58.960
<v Speaker 1>but it is the thought that we may be cut</v>
<v Speaker 1>off from one another which is so </v>

1018
00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:02.321
<v Speaker 1>terrible and that our baby may grow up </v>
<v Speaker 1>without my knowing her and without her </v>

1019
00:51:02.321 --> 00:51:03.020
<v Speaker 1>knowing me.</v>

1020
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:08.150
<v Speaker 1>It is difficult to face and I know your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life without me would be a dull blank.</v>

1021
00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:12.050
<v Speaker 1>You must never let it become holy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for two,</v>

1022
00:51:12.051 --> 00:51:14.720
<v Speaker 1>you will be left the greatest charge and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the world,</v>

1023
00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:18.170
<v Speaker 1>the upbringing of our baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God blessed that child.</v>

1024
00:51:18.171 --> 00:51:21.850
<v Speaker 1>She's the hope of life to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My darling are for.</v>

1025
00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:27.340
<v Speaker 1>It may be that you will only have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>read these lines as one of passing </v>

1026
00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:28.550
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

1027
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:34.120
<v Speaker 1>they may well be my last message to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>if they are no throw all your life that </v>

1028
00:51:34.311 --> 00:51:39.311
<v Speaker 1>I've loved you and baby with all my </v>
<v Speaker 1>heart and soul that you to sweet things </v>

1029
00:51:39.311 --> 00:51:41.540
<v Speaker 1>were just all the world to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pray,</v>

1030
00:51:41.541 --> 00:51:45.650
<v Speaker 1>God that I may do my duty for I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that may entail,</v>

1031
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:50.060
<v Speaker 1>you would not have it otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to quote Captain Charles,</v>

1032
00:51:50.061 --> 00:51:55.061
<v Speaker 1>May Twenty Second Manchester Regiment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then Peter Harte writes quote </v>

1033
00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:59.480
<v Speaker 1>Charles May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the loving husband of Bessie Mae and the</v>

1034
00:51:59.481 --> 00:52:02.690
<v Speaker 1>father to his baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pauline would indeed be killed.</v>

1035
00:52:02.691 --> 00:52:05.690
<v Speaker 1>The next day he's buried in the dancing </v>
<v Speaker 1>ally,</v>

1036
00:52:05.691 --> 00:52:08.480
<v Speaker 1>British cemetery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small scale tragedies.</v>

1037
00:52:08.481 --> 00:52:09.680
<v Speaker 1>He writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>litter,</v>

1038
00:52:09.681 --> 00:52:14.681
<v Speaker 1>the history of war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sad reminders that the necessities of </v>

1039
00:52:14.681 --> 00:52:18.311
<v Speaker 1>war ruined the lives of millions and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote that ladies and gentlemen is an </v>

1040
00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:25.220
<v Speaker 1>art form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My thanks to Peter Hart for talking with</v>

1041
00:52:25.221 --> 00:52:28.130
<v Speaker 1>us today and listened down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're lucky,</v>

1042
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:29.720
<v Speaker 1>we'll get to do it again.</v>

1043
00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:37.780
<v Speaker 1>We've been telling you about audible for</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1044
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Obviously audio books and a whole lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

1045
00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:43.420
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't discovered the joys of </v>
<v Speaker 1>audio books,</v>

1046
00:52:43.421 --> 00:52:48.421
<v Speaker 1>there's elements to it that I think are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to develop that I already find </v>

1047
00:52:48.421 --> 00:52:52.171
<v Speaker 1>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the element of whose voice it is </v>

1048
00:52:52.171 --> 00:52:53.680
<v Speaker 1>reading to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something you don't consider.</v>

1049
00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:55.420
<v Speaker 1>When you think about getting a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

1050
00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the narrator?</v>

1051
00:52:56.831 --> 00:53:01.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagine one day you're going to be </v>

1052
00:53:01.831 --> 00:53:01.831
<v Speaker 1>able to customize this with some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>button,</v>

1053
00:53:01.831 --> 00:53:02.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your favorite movie star.</v>

1054
00:53:02.021 --> 00:53:05.650
<v Speaker 1>I went Michael Caine narrating today's </v>
<v Speaker 1>book and it'll all come out that way,</v>

1055
00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:11.910
<v Speaker 1>but I was looking for recommendations </v>
<v Speaker 1>for today's a particular little </v>

1056
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:12.640
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1057
00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Peter Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who we just talked to has a couple of </v>

1058
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:19.501
<v Speaker 1>books on audible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're narrated by different </v>

1059
00:53:19.501 --> 00:53:19.501
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm sampling them going,</v>

1060
00:53:19.501 --> 00:53:23.881
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I want Peter Hart's spoke on the </v>

1061
00:53:23.881 --> 00:53:23.881
<v Speaker 1>Somme in this voice.</v>

1062
00:53:23.881 --> 00:53:25.950
<v Speaker 1>You're doing what Peter Hearts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other book on the Somme in other voice.</v>

1063
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.690
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting because it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>element.</v>

1064
00:53:27.691 --> 00:53:29.910
<v Speaker 1>You don't think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a performance aspect to it.</v>

1065
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:34.830
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the things to like about </v>
<v Speaker 1>audio books as you get to Kinda,</v>

1066
00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:40.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have different people read to you in </v>

1067
00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:40.310
<v Speaker 1>different voices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decide what you like.</v>

1068
00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:43.581
<v Speaker 1>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some day I imagine this will be quite </v>

1069
00:53:43.581 --> 00:53:44.040
<v Speaker 1>customizable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Audio books of course been around a long</v>

1070
00:53:44.041 --> 00:53:45.350
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>which I love.</v>

1086
00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.890
<v Speaker 1>It is so weird to me to purchase </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and then realize,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I want to own it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a big selection too,</v>

00:54:36.571 --> 00:54:37.680
<v Speaker 1>thriller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sci Fi,</v>

1095
00:54:37.681 --> 00:54:39.480
<v Speaker 1>fantasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self-development kids,</v>

1096
00:54:39.481 --> 00:54:39.900
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1097
00:54:39.901 --> 00:54:42.180
<v Speaker 1>you know like a bookstore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1098
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:46.110
<v Speaker 1>When I was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you liked audio books,</v>

1099
00:54:46.111 --> 00:54:51.111
<v Speaker 1>you got to go to the library and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they had available on cassette </v>

1100
00:54:51.111 --> 00:54:54.291
<v Speaker 1>tapes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when a new book comes out and hits </v>

1101
00:54:54.291 --> 00:54:57.360
<v Speaker 1>the bookstores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>digital and brick and mortar,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm audible usually has the two.</v>

1103
00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:02.910
<v Speaker 1>That's a sign of the popularity of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and why not?</v>

1104
00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:08.340
<v Speaker 1>It allows you to read a good book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to motivate yourself,</v>

1105
00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:10.830

<v Speaker 1>Busy people are consuming books at rates</v>

1114
00:55:32.941 --> 00:55:35.430

<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

1115
00:55:35.431 --> 00:55:37.560
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't be able to find the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

1116
00:55:37.590 --> 00:55:41.250
<v Speaker 1>Audio books fill a void and audibles the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best place to get them.</v>

<v Speaker 1>500 dash 500 and get started today.</v>

1124
00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:06.170
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know what to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I recommend Peter Hearts two books on </v>

1125
00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:09.921
<v Speaker 1>the somme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The newer one probably has more updated </v>

1126
00:56:09.921 --> 00:56:11.070
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The official title of that is the Psalm,</v>

1127
00:56:11.250 --> 00:56:16.250
<v Speaker 1>the darkest hour on the western front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's got an earlier book on the </v>

1128
00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Somme also on audible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrated by an English gentleman.</v>

1129
00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:20.170
<v Speaker 1>I believe his name is pronounced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1130
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Tim Pickets Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to me it sounds like Peter Hearts</v>

1131
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.720
<v Speaker 2>actually reading the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book.</v>

1132
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:28.660
<v Speaker 2>So the newer book probably has the newer</v>
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>

1133
00:56:28.661 --> 00:56:31.810
<v Speaker 2>but if you really want to have somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>reading to you that sounds more like the</v>

1134
00:56:31.811 --> 00:56:36.811
<v Speaker 2>author get the earlier book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The good news is they're both available </v>

1135
00:56:36.811 --> 00:56:38.230
<v Speaker 2>on audible and if you can't decide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel free to buy them both.</v>

1136
00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:46.130
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They older hardcore history shows can be</v>

1137
00:56:46.131 --> 00:56:51.131
<v Speaker 2>a bit traumatic with titles like death </v>
<v Speaker 2>throes of the republic judgment had been</v>

1138
00:56:52.041 --> 00:56:57.041
<v Speaker 2>a va and addicted to bondage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just consider that truth in </v>
