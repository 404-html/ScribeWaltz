00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.910
<v Speaker 1>It's hardcore history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was designing this hardcore </v>

7
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:29.541
<v Speaker 1>history denim format,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that we were going to want to do </v>

8
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:32.271
<v Speaker 1>interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good way for us to get out </v>

9
00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>content quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting and that it involves </v>

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other voices,</v>

11
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.991
<v Speaker 1>people that you might want to know more </v>
<v Speaker 1>about and I knew that we would have </v>

12
00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:43.911
<v Speaker 1>authors on because there's always a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of good people writing intriguing books </v>

13
00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:43.911
<v Speaker 1>because I'm reading them.</v>

14
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>I knew we would want to have experts on </v>
<v Speaker 1>from time to time because after all it's</v>

15
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:50.610
<v Speaker 1>a great use of the medium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

16
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.630
<v Speaker 1>And I was hoping that we could get some </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary source people on from time to </v>

17
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>time participants in the events that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about.</v>

18
00:00:57.901 --> 00:00:58.980
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:01.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a historian because historians </v>
<v Speaker 1>chronicle,</v>

20
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things for history and for footnotes and</v>

21
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:08.811
<v Speaker 1>stuff in books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe we could do a little bit of </v>

22
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:10.851
<v Speaker 1>that if we were interviewing people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were participants in these sorts of </v>

23
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:14.961
<v Speaker 1>events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will today I have somebody that is sort </v>

24
00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:17.121
<v Speaker 1>of the Trifecta of interviews for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>program cause he meets all three of </v>

25
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>those specifications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an author,</v>

26
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.310
<v Speaker 1>he's an expert and he's a primary source</v>
<v Speaker 1>and participant.</v>

27
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:28.311
<v Speaker 1>His name is Merrill Mcpeak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He happens to be a four star air force </v>

28
00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He flew with the thunderbirds,</v>

29
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:36.861
<v Speaker 1>the acrobatic team for the air force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is a commander or a chief of staff in</v>

30
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:42.891
<v Speaker 1>the air force and did so during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first Gulf War and he flew more than 250</v>

31
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 1>combat missions in Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that for a second.</v>

32
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.370
<v Speaker 1>He's also a noted author who's got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>brand new book out to add to his catalog</v>

33
00:01:55.411 --> 00:02:00.411
<v Speaker 1>of books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His new book is called roles and </v>

34
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 1>missions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which goes over his time as the 14th air</v>

35
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>force chief of staff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

36
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.030
<v Speaker 1>sort of a bipartisan guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked for the Bob Dole Republican </v>

37
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.451
<v Speaker 1>campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also supported and was in the Barack </v>

38
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Obama administration in terms of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>military capacity.</v>

39
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>He writes about his time in Vietnam and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his book called Hangar flying.</v>

40
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>He's got another one called below the </v>
<v Speaker 1>zone,</v>

41
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.820
<v Speaker 1>another one called the Vietnam chapters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you like military history,</v>

42
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>especially air force history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Merrill,</v>

43
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Tony Mcpeak is somebody whose books </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be on your bookshelf.</v>

44
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.670
<v Speaker 1>We talked to the four star general now </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was nice enough to come and talk </v>

45
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.670
<v Speaker 1>with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

46
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.610
<v Speaker 1>you may have recently seen him in Ken </v>
<v Speaker 1>Burns,</v>

47
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.530
<v Speaker 1>recent multipart documentary on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam War as well.</v>

48
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the show general mcpeak.</v>

49
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.110
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get started by suggesting,</v>

50
00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:53.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:53.651 --> 00:02:58.651
<v Speaker 1>the person we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were contacting your publicist or </v>

52
00:02:58.651 --> 00:02:58.651
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>was discussing the 50th year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Tet offensive.</v>

54
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 1>And when I was thinking about how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start this,</v>

55
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in that generation where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't in the war.</v>

57
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 1>We were in the early eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle eighties.</v>

58
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:12.991
<v Speaker 1>We were the ones learning about the war </v>
<v Speaker 1>in college and the veterans would come </v>

59
00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:15.901
<v Speaker 1>and speak in our classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember 60 minutes did a whole </v>

60
00:03:15.901 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 1>big thing on how here we were studying </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lessons of Vietnam.</v>

61
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:22.231
<v Speaker 1>And what did we learn?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought now here we are decades </v>

62
00:03:22.231 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 1>later and I thought I would ask you 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years after the Tet offensive,</v>

63
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 1>what do you think we learned and do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the things we learned,</v>

64
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the 19 seventies or 19 eighties,</v>

65
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:31.990
<v Speaker 1>do you think those lessons stuck?</v>

66
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking as a professional military guy,</v>

67
00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:41.360
<v Speaker 2>we learned a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We learned,</v>

68
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.010
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as an air force fighter pilot,</v>

69
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 2>we learned we had to hit what we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>aiming.</v>

70
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.740
<v Speaker 2>We've missed most of the targets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think our average distance of Vietnam </v>

71
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.381
<v Speaker 2>was like a 100 meters and that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>good enough if you're going after a </v>

72
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.790
<v Speaker 2>target,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a bridge or a vehicle,</v>

73
00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:07.791
<v Speaker 2>like a tank or a truck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we invented precision guided </v>

74
00:04:07.791 --> 00:04:10.890
<v Speaker 2>munitions and you've seen the results </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we learned.</v>

75
00:04:10.891 --> 00:04:15.891
<v Speaker 2>We had to be able to operate at night </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we now or nobody wants to fight us </v>

76
00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:22.131
<v Speaker 2>at night nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to find the daytime </v>

77
00:04:22.131 --> 00:04:22.131
<v Speaker 2>either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>

78
00:04:22.131 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 2>we re really dominate knife fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we've learned that we had to be </v>

79
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.880
<v Speaker 2>invisible on radar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in invented aircraft.</v>

80
00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

81
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.330
<v Speaker 2>from the standpoint of the professional </v>
<v Speaker 2>military,</v>

82
00:04:33.331 --> 00:04:38.331
<v Speaker 2>we learned a lot and we improved a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the war lasted so long.</v>

83
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.240
<v Speaker 2>Tenure for all of us got to go there at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least once.</v>

84
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.270
<v Speaker 2>We all saw what needed to be fixed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we fixed it.</v>

85
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:51.130
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you now ask a what did we learn </v>

86
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 2>politically or socially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the,</v>

87
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.510
<v Speaker 2>by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lessons were not learned at all.</v>

88
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Or if they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were forgotten.</v>

89
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we repeat the same mistakes,</v>

90
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a war after war,</v>

91
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:07.290
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

92
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technically we learned a lot,</v>

93
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Speaker 2>but big picture wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we,</v>

94
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.280
<v Speaker 2>we missed the boat,</v>

95
00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about the concept in </v>

96
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.070
<v Speaker 1>business of like institutional memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.700
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:21.690
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the,</v>

99
00:05:21.691 --> 00:05:22.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

100
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.780
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the people can come and go</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a large corporation,</v>

101
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:26.880
<v Speaker 1>but theoretically when new people come </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

102
00:05:26.881 --> 00:05:29.640
<v Speaker 1>they're trained with the lessons learned</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the previous generation.</v>

103
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about institutional memory </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the military.</v>

104
00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:37.491
<v Speaker 1>So if you guys get a guy like William </v>
<v Speaker 1>Westmoreland who was a second world war </v>

105
00:05:37.491 --> 00:05:37.491
<v Speaker 1>veteran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows how to fight,</v>

106
00:05:37.491 --> 00:05:42.411
<v Speaker 1>that kind of war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to deal with this counterinsurgency </v>

107
00:05:42.411 --> 00:05:45.680
<v Speaker 1>situation in Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretically learns what he's going to </v>

108
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.500
<v Speaker 1>learn there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then Westmoreland retires the people</v>

109
00:05:46.501 --> 00:05:49.480
<v Speaker 1>who were right below him retire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

110
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:54.481
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is institutional memory in the military </v>

111
00:05:54.481 --> 00:05:57.471
<v Speaker 1>sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little like something like a Bush in </v>

112
00:05:57.471 --> 00:05:59.691
<v Speaker 1>front of your yard that you have to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut back because every generation comes </v>

113
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:04.211
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to relearn some of those same </v>

114
00:06:04.211 --> 00:06:04.211
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

115
00:06:04.211 --> 00:06:04.211
<v Speaker 1>Is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:06:04.211 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 1>when you read like the Peloponnesian war</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the stuff from ancient Athens,</v>

117
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:07.800
<v Speaker 1>there's the hubris element.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Hubris something that,</v>

118
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 1>that a good punch in the nose can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can teach you permanently?</v>

119
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>Or do you need to be reminded every now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then?</v>

120
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:18.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at the dominance we have right </v>

121
00:06:18.851 --> 00:06:20.381
<v Speaker 1>now on the battlefield and I worry that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if we got into a major conflict right </v>

122
00:06:20.381 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have anyone in the institutions</v>

123
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.260
<v Speaker 1>at the higher levels now that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>fought,</v>

124
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.380
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a real war against another first </v>

125
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.380
<v Speaker 1>world military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

126
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.420
<v Speaker 1>would they almost have to do like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverse of what Westmoreland had to do,</v>

127
00:06:32.421 --> 00:06:37.421
<v Speaker 1>where he had to learn to go from a world</v>
<v Speaker 1>war mentality to a counterinsurgency </v>

128
00:06:37.421 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 1>mentality mentality if we ever had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight China in some islands off,</v>

129
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the east China Sea,</v>

130
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 1>is that relearning a kind of warfare </v>
<v Speaker 1>that westmoreland understood.</v>

131
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:47.290
<v Speaker 1>But we haven't done in so long we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to do anymore.</v>

132
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really long question.</v>

133
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a wonderful question because </v>

134
00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.430
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're a practice to fight the last war.</v>

135
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 2>I think that's even giving too much </v>
<v Speaker 2>credit.</v>

136
00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.310
<v Speaker 2>Look a your question is our military </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations learning organizations </v>

137
00:07:15.831 --> 00:07:20.540
<v Speaker 2>that can benefit through experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they are,</v>

138
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.200
<v Speaker 2>but remember we fought Vietnam with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a draft force conscripted army,</v>

139
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.910
<v Speaker 2>and it was only after that that Nixon </v>
<v Speaker 2>was really forced to abandon the draft </v>

140
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:39.731
<v Speaker 2>and to create the all volunteer force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The all volunteer force is that </v>

141
00:07:39.731 --> 00:07:44.450
<v Speaker 2>different kind of army from the army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

142
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:49.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably true that a </v>

143
00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.840
<v Speaker 2>professional force can be a learning </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization,</v>

144
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.120
<v Speaker 2>whereas buying large citizen based,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

145
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 2>army,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

146
00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:02.660
<v Speaker 2>are not because they're constantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking in new guys or short term of </v>

147
00:08:03.831 --> 00:08:08.831
<v Speaker 2>service and they have to train them from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning every six months and,</v>

148
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:10.880
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

149
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:11.930
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>

150
00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:13.190
<v Speaker 2>it's a good question.</v>

151
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:18.250
<v Speaker 2>It's a profound question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes back to the Peloponnesian wars </v>

152
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.870
<v Speaker 2>or before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>

153
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.560
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not sure you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I have a total totally good answer </v>

154
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:32.471
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that the army coming out of </v>

155
00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:33.560
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam was not happy with its </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

156
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:39.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Westmoreland Westmoreland's failures in </v>

157
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:40.440
<v Speaker 2>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

158
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:45.580
<v Speaker 2>and guys like Norm Schwarzkopf and Colin</v>
<v Speaker 2>Powell set about rebuilding the culture </v>

159
00:08:48.621 --> 00:08:53.621
<v Speaker 2>of the army and the army we have today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's considerably better than </v>

160
00:08:55.351 --> 00:09:00.351
<v Speaker 2>the one we had in Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was guilty of fragging,</v>

161
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:05.391
<v Speaker 2>its own officers and senior NCO and drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>abuse and other forms of,</v>

162
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:11.980
<v Speaker 2>of disciplined on the front lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you see that kind of army </v>

163
00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.170
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you'd have to say,</v>

164
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:17.040
<v Speaker 2>I think that that we did learn from that</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

165
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.470
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the larger lessons.</v>

166
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:24.471
<v Speaker 2>So are the policy level less than </v>
<v Speaker 2>political lessons and there I've seen no</v>

167
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:27.660
<v Speaker 2>evidence that we've learned very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am there.</v>

168
00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:32.661
<v Speaker 2>I see that this ancient Greek a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few breaths to still around,</v>

169
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in spades</v>

170
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.110
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this may just be one person.</v>

171
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm shooting an Arrow and painting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullseye around it afterwards.</v>

172
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:49.401
<v Speaker 1>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that there's always this </v>

173
00:09:49.401 --> 00:09:52.011
<v Speaker 1>wonderful out that people who want to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like I want to invade Russia </v>

174
00:09:52.011 --> 00:09:53.280
<v Speaker 1>and I'm the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the Nazi.</v>

175
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.080
<v Speaker 1>Often someone comes up to me and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

176
00:09:55.081 --> 00:10:00.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't work out very well for </v>

177
00:10:00.081 --> 00:10:01.491
<v Speaker 1>Charles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The twelfth didn't work out very well </v>

178
00:10:01.491 --> 00:10:01.491
<v Speaker 1>for Napoleon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to invade Russia.</v>

179
00:10:01.491 --> 00:10:05.721
<v Speaker 1>So I say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't have the offer and they </v>

180
00:10:05.721 --> 00:10:08.871
<v Speaker 1>didn't have the off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore those historical lessons from </v>

181
00:10:08.871 --> 00:10:11.661
<v Speaker 1>the past are not applicable and I feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a human tendency to do </v>

182
00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:11.661
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even now,</v>

183
00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:16.641
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say if our military today went and </v>

184
00:10:16.641 --> 00:10:17.940
<v Speaker 1>rethought the Vietnam War in the 21st </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

185
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:23.330
<v Speaker 1>we could do that and we could win </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of all this stuff we have that </v>

186
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:23.460
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

187
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.840
<v Speaker 1>we can go into Afghanistan and it won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the graveyard of empires because they</v>

188
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:30.030
<v Speaker 1>didn't have smart bombs in those old </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

189
00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that there's any validity </v>

190
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:35.250
<v Speaker 1>to that way of thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a little bit of a,</v>

191
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:39.740
<v Speaker 1>of a human nature sort of thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is there something you can do </v>

192
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:39.740
<v Speaker 1>institutionally that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

193
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.971
<v Speaker 1>this is how human beings behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's insulate ourselves from that </v>

194
00:10:43.971 --> 00:10:45.060
<v Speaker 1>typical human tendency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

195
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.550
<v Speaker 2>There is an element of a Shakespearean </v>
<v Speaker 2>tragedy,</v>

196
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.810
<v Speaker 2>man is a creature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

197
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.620
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

198
00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:00.740
<v Speaker 2>you see these foibles pop up time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

199
00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:02.450
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will say this,</v>

200
00:11:02.451 --> 00:11:06.860
<v Speaker 2>that I think the professional military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially at the senior level,</v>

201
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:12.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are reluctant fighters a fish.</v>

202
00:11:12.681 --> 00:11:14.440
<v Speaker 2>That's been my experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I,</v>

203
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know George Patton,</v>

204
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.970
<v Speaker 2>but by and large from my experience in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the JCS and senior Washington levels,</v>

205
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.190
<v Speaker 2>there's nobody looking for a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

206
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:33.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their advice uniformly has been slow </v>

207
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.350
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

208
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.640
<v Speaker 2>it really didn't work for Napoleon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

209
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on the civilian side,</v>

210
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in case of the Middle East problems that</v>

211
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:50.000
<v Speaker 2>we're having still today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the neo-cons know the guys who had never</v>

212
00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:52.370
<v Speaker 2>worn a uniform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dick.</v>

213
00:11:52.371 --> 00:11:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Cheney had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

214
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.510
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

215
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:02.310
<v Speaker 2>excuses for not going to Vietnam and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people around him in those levels.</v>

216
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:05.850
<v Speaker 2>We're anxious to go back and do Iraq </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

217
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.880
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to really get Saddam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're saying this time that wasn't </v>

218
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.970
<v Speaker 2>military,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a political people.</v>

219
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.840
<v Speaker 2>And so the Hubris that I have seen has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been wearing the dark blue suits not to </v>

220
00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:20.620
<v Speaker 2>uniforms.</v>

221
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had met General Mattis wants,</v>

222
00:12:23.241 --> 00:12:25.060
<v Speaker 1>and he had basically said something </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>

223
00:12:25.061 --> 00:12:30.061
<v Speaker 1>He was very cognizant of the limitations</v>
<v Speaker 1>of military power when I was talking to </v>

224
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:33.130
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then let me ask you this then.</v>

225
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:38.430
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that there's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutional bias in this country and </v>

226
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:38.430
<v Speaker 1>it's a human thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

227
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:42.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't blame anyone against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it the can't do general as </v>

228
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:47.221
<v Speaker 1>opposed to the can do general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say we're talking about the </v>

229
00:12:47.221 --> 00:12:50.911
<v Speaker 1>50th anniversary of Ted and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about Vietnam and Johnson or </v>

230
00:12:50.911 --> 00:12:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Nixon brings in a couple of military </v>
<v Speaker 1>advisors and out of the five of them,</v>

231
00:12:52.991 --> 00:12:55.180
<v Speaker 1>four of them say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course we can win this war.</v>

232
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put me in charge and I'll do it.</v>

233
00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:58.540
<v Speaker 1>And one guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

234
00:12:58.541 --> 00:12:58.760
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

235
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:00.040
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to win this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>

236
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Let's figure out a way to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>here with honor.</v>

237
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there a natural tendency to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

238
00:13:04.781 --> 00:13:07.480
<v Speaker 1>the can't do guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to go with that.</v>

239
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go with somebody who tells </v>
<v Speaker 1>me he can get it done.</v>

240
00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:11.260
<v Speaker 1>And isn't there a sense in the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

241
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be the guy that says we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do this.</v>

242
00:13:14.081 --> 00:13:16.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be thought of as the guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>who says this is unwinnable.</v>

243
00:13:16.931 --> 00:13:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Of course you put me in charge and I'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it done.</v>

244
00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to me that it's,</v>

245
00:13:20.571 --> 00:13:23.710
<v Speaker 1>it's tough for someone to stand up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of situation and say,</v>

246
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.080
<v Speaker 1>let's not do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't be successful.</v>

247
00:13:26.081 --> 00:13:28.760
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be prudent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that have any,</v>

248
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:34.260
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutional failures with the people </v>

249
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.451
<v Speaker 1>who wear suits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a problem that they're going to </v>

250
00:13:36.451 --> 00:13:36.451
<v Speaker 1>run into?</v>

251
00:13:36.451 --> 00:13:37.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan,</v>

252
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.060
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put a very deep question,</v>

253
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.400
<v Speaker 2>but let me just say that isn't the way I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have seen the problem formulated during </v>

254
00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:54.211
<v Speaker 2>my time in Washington now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure this changes as the cast of </v>

255
00:13:54.211 --> 00:13:58.591
<v Speaker 2>characters changes in Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but typically the president doesn't ask </v>

256
00:14:00.401 --> 00:14:04.410
<v Speaker 2>advice of five guys and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

257
00:14:04.411 --> 00:14:05.290
<v Speaker 2>for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

258
00:14:05.291 --> 00:14:06.510
<v Speaker 2>I can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One Says No.</v>

259
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.050
<v Speaker 2>What the president says is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

260
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:11.860
<v Speaker 2>we've got a problem here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are my options?</v>

261
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.850
<v Speaker 2>So he's not looking for a yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no answer.</v>

262
00:14:15.851 --> 00:14:19.810
<v Speaker 2>It's not a binary problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he's looking for is,</v>

263
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gimme a half a dozen things I might do </v>

264
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.380
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me the pros and cons of each thing.</v>

265
00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:29.290
<v Speaker 2>Let me make a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

266
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that case,</v>

267
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:35.910
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're opposed to taking a military </v>

268
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:36.370
<v Speaker 2>action,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just put it in the conscious.</v>

269
00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:41.380
<v Speaker 2>So here's the deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to lose friends around the </v>

270
00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.031
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to lose international </v>

271
00:14:45.031 --> 00:14:45.031
<v Speaker 2>standing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a trade's going to dry up or whatever.</v>

272
00:14:45.031 --> 00:14:47.380
<v Speaker 2>You can put an econ and you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

273
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.520
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the proper approach from the military </v>

274
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:52.760
<v Speaker 2>advisors is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

275
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.030
<v Speaker 2>if you want to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's how you,</v>

276
00:14:56.031 --> 00:15:00.130
<v Speaker 2>here are a set of options and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the and the,</v>

277
00:15:00.131 --> 00:15:05.131
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the pluses and minuses to go with </v>

278
00:15:05.131 --> 00:15:07.931
<v Speaker 2>them and then it's up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a little different formulation </v>

279
00:15:07.931 --> 00:15:07.931
<v Speaker 2>than the one you put.</v>

280
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're the military advisor and </v>

281
00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:13.800
<v Speaker 1>you've been in the role of been chief of</v>
<v Speaker 1>staff before you,</v>

282
00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:15.160
<v Speaker 1>you've been the air force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

283
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.130
<v Speaker 1>a four star general here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

284
00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:22.220
<v Speaker 1>if somebody comes to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the presence that I need your advice on </v>

285
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:22.320
<v Speaker 1>this and he says something to the effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

286
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

287
00:15:24.751 --> 00:15:26.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm losing my train of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>General.</v>

288
00:15:26.041 --> 00:15:27.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting old now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty two,</v>

289
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:32.360
<v Speaker 1>just a little low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm getting their aging quickly.</v>

290
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what I wanted to get with that.</v>

291
00:15:36.151 --> 00:15:36.500
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

292
00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:41.540
<v Speaker 1>so the old line about the Vietnam War </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the political nature of the </v>

293
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.440
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

294
00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.920
<v Speaker 1>operating as a person who's picking </v>
<v Speaker 1>tactical targets for aircraft to bomb.</v>

295
00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.810
<v Speaker 1>And yet the old argument that we learned</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in,</v>

296
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:56.830
<v Speaker 1>in military history class for why that </v>
<v Speaker 1>might have been necessary was the </v>

297
00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:57.510
<v Speaker 1>president's got to worry about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

298
00:15:57.511 --> 00:16:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Soviet involvement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the threats of nuclear war,</v>

299
00:16:00.241 --> 00:16:01.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other things happening,</v>

300
00:16:01.531 --> 00:16:06.531
<v Speaker 1>including maybe funding a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very people you're fighting at a </v>

301
00:16:06.531 --> 00:16:06.531
<v Speaker 1>higher level to compensate.</v>

302
00:16:06.531 --> 00:16:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the guys on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the military leaders are worried about,</v>

303
00:16:09.091 --> 00:16:14.091
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I get victory in this theater of </v>

304
00:16:14.091 --> 00:16:16.011
<v Speaker 1>operations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the proper balance in your mind </v>

305
00:16:16.011 --> 00:16:20.930
<v Speaker 1>between a president who's got to worry </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the grand strategy across the </v>

306
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.100
<v Speaker 1>world and the general who's got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

307
00:16:23.101 --> 00:16:27.060
<v Speaker 1>if you just take your hands off of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll win this theater for you.</v>

308
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you see the balance of the </v>

309
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:32.300
<v Speaker 1>general says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

310
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:32.460
<v Speaker 1>general mcpeak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the President says,</v>

311
00:16:32.461 --> 00:16:36.330
<v Speaker 1>General Mcpeak help me out here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you tell them to do?</v>

312
00:16:36.331 --> 00:16:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Visa VI allowing generals to have a free</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand versus a Lyndon Johnson who's maybe</v>

313
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:45.240
<v Speaker 1>more worried about the Soviet Union than</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is about making sure no more resupply</v>

314
00:16:45.241 --> 00:16:46.860
<v Speaker 1>ships get into Haiphong harbor.</v>

315
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

316
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:59.300
<v Speaker 2>this is a problem which is at the heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>of limited warfare.</v>

317
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if for instance,</v>

318
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.160
<v Speaker 2>you asked Curt Lemay</v>

319
00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:09.960
<v Speaker 1>representative</v>

320
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.230
<v Speaker 2>a bomb went back into the stone age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

321
00:17:13.231 --> 00:17:18.231
<v Speaker 2>he did say that and we could have won </v>
<v Speaker 2>had we knew Tannoy the war would've been</v>

322
00:17:19.871 --> 00:17:23.620
<v Speaker 2>over right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the war was always winnable.</v>

323
00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:29.550
<v Speaker 2>It was just a question of what means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how limited are the means you want to </v>

324
00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.990
<v Speaker 2>use you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you go to the presenter,</v>

325
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm assuming you don't want to use </v>

326
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.000
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

327
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.770
<v Speaker 2>we have an instance case right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very relevant.</v>

328
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:44.160
<v Speaker 2>North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we seek to intervene in North </v>

329
00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:49.170
<v Speaker 2>Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first question we should ask </v>

330
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.400
<v Speaker 2>ourselves is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this a limited war or the means we're</v>

331
00:17:50.401 --> 00:17:53.770
<v Speaker 2>going to use limited now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not just the message,</v>

332
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.500
<v Speaker 2>it will have a limited amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

333
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.340
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to put a limit on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of money we're going to spend?</v>

334
00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:05.620
<v Speaker 2>So you have to decide all of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>boundaries of the limitations you're </v>

335
00:18:06.421 --> 00:18:11.421
<v Speaker 2>going to put on warfare and then that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has to be bought by the president.</v>

336
00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have to tell President </v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnson,</v>

337
00:18:15.751 --> 00:18:20.670
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I have to worry more about the Soviet</v>

338
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Union and I do a winning in quotes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say in South Vietnam,</v>

339
00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:30.270
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just tell me that and that means I can't</v>

340
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.660
<v Speaker 2>mine Hanoi harbor and blow up some </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet boat.</v>

341
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:39.380
<v Speaker 2>Now are you willing to live with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the president has to understand that </v>

342
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.600
<v Speaker 2>the nature of the war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be limited and that means </v>

343
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.440
<v Speaker 2>we may or may not win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's unlimited,</v>

344
00:18:46.441 --> 00:18:50.730
<v Speaker 2>I know we can be north Vietnam or North </v>
<v Speaker 2>Korea anytime.</v>

345
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.400
<v Speaker 2>So the first question you have to ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

346
00:18:53.401 --> 00:18:55.410
<v Speaker 2>what limitations are you going to put on</v>
<v Speaker 2>me?</v>

347
00:18:55.411 --> 00:19:00.411
<v Speaker 2>So we understand all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Typically today we don't talk in terms </v>

348
00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:04.710
<v Speaker 2>of limited war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talk in terms of rules of engagement.</v>

349
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.990
<v Speaker 2>What rules of engagement is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president or the secretary of defense or</v>

350
00:19:09.991 --> 00:19:13.920
<v Speaker 2>the theater commander or whatever going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to impose on operations,</v>

351
00:19:13.921 --> 00:19:18.030
<v Speaker 2>and we need to be eyes wide open about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that upfront.</v>

352
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Now inside the rules of engagement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would argue you ought to give the </v>

353
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.620
<v Speaker 2>military guy as much flexibility as </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

354
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:30.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't want the president picking </v>
<v Speaker 2>targets in the basement of the White </v>

355
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:31.860
<v Speaker 2>House,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

356
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.280
<v Speaker 2>because he doesn't know much about </v>
<v Speaker 2>targeting a no.</v>

357
00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.420
<v Speaker 2>He's going to pick the wrong targets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are you gonna?</v>

358
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Tell me to attack them from the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction or it's going to tell me to </v>

359
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.591
<v Speaker 2>use the wrong munitions or he's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me to send to few airplanes or too </v>

360
00:19:48.591 --> 00:19:50.580
<v Speaker 2>many airplanes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are.</v>

361
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.640
<v Speaker 2>Those are questions that he knows very </v>
<v Speaker 2>little about and what he needs to do is </v>

362
00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:01.580
<v Speaker 2>impose rules of engagement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me what the limitations are and </v>

363
00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.480
<v Speaker 2>leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as long as I operate inside the</v>

364
00:20:03.481 --> 00:20:08.481
<v Speaker 2>limitation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she should never have no any kind of a </v>

365
00:20:08.481 --> 00:20:12.470
<v Speaker 2>quibble or complaint about how I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how I'm doing and what the result is.</v>

366
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.790
<v Speaker 2>So the consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

367
00:20:14.791 --> 00:20:19.230
<v Speaker 2>the fact is we never lost a battle in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam.</v>

368
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.710
<v Speaker 2>We just lost the war and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he has,</v>

369
00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:29.810
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not a big fan of West Berlin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I regard him miss rather dumb and mean </v>

370
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.710
<v Speaker 2>that is what he tried to do with stupid </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion and not much,</v>

371
00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.970
<v Speaker 2>not much improved when he was succeeded </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the Abrams,</v>

372
00:20:38.971 --> 00:20:43.971
<v Speaker 2>although there's a big school of thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>that says Abrams was a much more </v>

373
00:20:43.971 --> 00:20:46.760
<v Speaker 2>talented officer and we were on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right track once we got rid of.</v>

374
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.600
<v Speaker 2>But in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

375
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.680
<v Speaker 2>the point is that there are things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians are expert in and there are </v>

376
00:20:57.041 --> 00:21:01.510
<v Speaker 2>things that professional military or </v>
<v Speaker 2>expert in and we need to understand who,</v>

377
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:03.060
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who does what here,</v>

378
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:07.360
<v Speaker 2>when you're picking targets in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>basement of the White House,</v>

379
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.810
<v Speaker 2>you're on the wrong track and you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to lose,</v>

380
00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:15.811
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you got the wrong guy doing the </v>

381
00:21:15.811 --> 00:21:15.811
<v Speaker 2>wrong thing</v>

382
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.370
<v Speaker 1>on the right track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a key point.</v>

383
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.980
<v Speaker 1>So when I'm watching Ken Burns Vietnam </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary,</v>

384
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:25.440
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that just screams at </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

385
00:21:25.441 --> 00:21:30.441
<v Speaker 1>I was reminded once again at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>veterans coming into the class I was in </v>

386
00:21:30.441 --> 00:21:30.570
<v Speaker 1>the 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was it screams at you,</v>

387
00:21:30.571 --> 00:21:35.571
<v Speaker 1>is that you don't have any real way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>determining how you're doing at any </v>

388
00:21:35.731 --> 00:21:38.040
<v Speaker 1>given time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the classic way that was used was</v>

389
00:21:38.041 --> 00:21:40.350
<v Speaker 1>body count,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we understand that if you don't have</v>

390
00:21:40.351 --> 00:21:42.950
<v Speaker 1>body counts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's how you.</v>

391
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:48.170
<v Speaker 1>How do you measure progress in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's helpful to the heads of the </v>

392
00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:52.341
<v Speaker 1>military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the political heads and the population </v>

393
00:21:52.341 --> 00:21:52.590
<v Speaker 1>as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we could apply this to the situation</v>

394
00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:54.690
<v Speaker 1>in the Middle East for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

395
00:21:54.691 --> 00:21:59.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you gauge progress and if </v>

396
00:21:59.691 --> 00:22:01.731
<v Speaker 1>progress isn't going the way you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you double down on the efforts or do </v>

397
00:22:01.731 --> 00:22:01.731
<v Speaker 1>you determine that?</v>

398
00:22:01.731 --> 00:22:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean are we even capable of cutting </v>

399
00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:06.570
<v Speaker 1>loose?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there ever another choice?</v>

400
00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.460
<v Speaker 1>In Vietnam we act like we could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>just said,</v>

401
00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:10.230
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're losing the war so let's get out.</v>

402
00:22:10.231 --> 00:22:15.231
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the most difficult thing in the </v>

403
00:22:15.231 --> 00:22:16.800
<v Speaker 1>world to disengage from combat with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy strategic level or tactical level.</v>

404
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.510
<v Speaker 1>So I guess what I'm asking is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

405
00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:21.900
<v Speaker 1>how do you gauge progress whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're winning or losing,</v>

406
00:22:21.901 --> 00:22:26.490
<v Speaker 1>and then do you notice if it's not in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your interest to notice that your,</v>

407
00:22:26.491 --> 00:22:28.290
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not winning,</v>

408
00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you get.</v>

409
00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Because in the Vietnam War you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at these people that just seem </v>

410
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.450
<v Speaker 1>in retrospect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look like they know the war is </v>

411
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:39.240
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't say it,</v>

412
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.100
<v Speaker 1>they can't prove it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't,</v>

413
00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.880
<v Speaker 1>they can't operate or do anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

414
00:22:44.881 --> 00:22:49.881
<v Speaker 1>They seem frozen in the condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there seems to me to be a real need </v>

415
00:22:49.881 --> 00:22:53.631
<v Speaker 1>to be able to measure progress and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some sort of reaction to the data </v>

416
00:22:53.631 --> 00:22:54.810
<v Speaker 1>you're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

417
00:22:55.050 --> 00:23:00.050
<v Speaker 1>can you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you suggest a way maybe we could do </v>

418
00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:00.720
<v Speaker 1>that in the Middle East right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we decided it wasn't going well,</v>

419
00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.870
<v Speaker 1>what do you do then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

420
00:23:03.871 --> 00:23:05.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't this the crux of the issue?</v>

421
00:23:05.611 --> 00:23:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we winning or losing?</v>

422
00:23:06.841 --> 00:23:08.610
<v Speaker 1>And if we're winning or losing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do about it?</v>

423
00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:14.150
<v Speaker 2>Just quickly for the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

424
00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:19.000
<v Speaker 2>there used to be a way of judging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty easy territory.</v>

425
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>

426
00:23:20.931 --> 00:23:22.550
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you prevail,</v>

427
00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.910
<v Speaker 2>if you held the battlefield at the end </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other guy left,</v>

428
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.250
<v Speaker 2>you were winning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

429
00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:33.700
<v Speaker 2>So Churchill could be very worried about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was going on in north Africa </v>

430
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.460
<v Speaker 2>because Ronald pushed all the way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alabama,</v>

431
00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was inside Egypt,</v>

432
00:23:38.051 --> 00:23:39.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For Cairo.</v>

433
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.800
<v Speaker 2>And the Suez Canal was threatened </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the geography told Churchill </v>

434
00:23:46.081 --> 00:23:51.081
<v Speaker 2>that he was losing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we replaced a whoever it was with,</v>

435
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:52.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

436
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Montgomery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

437
00:23:55.470 --> 00:24:00.470
<v Speaker 2>it's not so in a linear war where armies</v>
<v Speaker 2>face each other,</v>

438
00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:05.840
<v Speaker 2>you can tell who's winning by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the front line is and what </v>

439
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:06.960
<v Speaker 2>direction it's moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or at least that's,</v>

440
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.500
<v Speaker 2>that's one gross approximation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

441
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:13.770
<v Speaker 2>if you're fighting and Gettysburg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not in good shape.</v>

442
00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

443
00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:21.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you got to be fighting and </v>

444
00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:23.431
<v Speaker 2>Chancellorsville or someplace downtown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's not so easy anymore with a </v>

445
00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:30.850
<v Speaker 2>stateless actors like Isis or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

446
00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a suicide bombers.</v>

447
00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:39.570
<v Speaker 2>How can you tell if you're winning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the guys doesn't have any </v>

448
00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:43.060
<v Speaker 2>territory to capture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have a national treasury that</v>

449
00:24:43.061 --> 00:24:46.900
<v Speaker 2>you can loot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't even really have a life worth</v>

450
00:24:46.901 --> 00:24:49.850
<v Speaker 2>living otherwise you wouldn't be in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>suicide bombing does.</v>

451
00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.760
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't care about his own life.</v>

452
00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:54.790
<v Speaker 2>So in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this kind of war,</v>

453
00:24:56.050 --> 00:25:01.050
<v Speaker 2>how do you judge where you are?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we have already answered </v>

454
00:25:02.711 --> 00:25:05.610
<v Speaker 2>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know there's there,</v>

455
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:08.590
<v Speaker 2>if we had a sort of an index of </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>

456
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.400
<v Speaker 2>he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the violence is down and we kind of</v>

457
00:25:12.401 --> 00:25:17.401
<v Speaker 2>have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in Afghanistan now we have the </v>

458
00:25:17.401 --> 00:25:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Taliban bombing again inside Kabul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

459
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:25.500
<v Speaker 2>And so the number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can plot the number of incidents on </v>

460
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.351
<v Speaker 2>a graph and say and just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they're more incidents this month </v>

461
00:25:28.351 --> 00:25:28.351
<v Speaker 2>and there were less month.</v>

462
00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:32.770
<v Speaker 2>You're not doing very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact that's what I'm doing in the</v>

463
00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:35.290
<v Speaker 2>Middle East now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of subjectively.</v>

464
00:25:35.291 --> 00:25:38.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a chart in my office that I</v>

465
00:25:38.681 --> 00:25:42.480
<v Speaker 2>keep track of this specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me I get.</v>

466
00:25:42.481 --> 00:25:47.481
<v Speaker 2>I have the sense that we're not doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>very well in Afghanistan and Iraq and </v>

467
00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:50.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

468
00:25:50.621 --> 00:25:55.621
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to come unstuck from </v>

469
00:25:55.621 --> 00:25:58.651
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a tar baby kind of deal where </v>

470
00:25:58.651 --> 00:25:58.651
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gee,</v>

471
00:25:58.651 --> 00:26:02.191
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could figure out how to get out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of here with my pride and,</v>

472
00:26:02.411 --> 00:26:04.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reputation and shape.</v>

473
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't see a way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

474
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:12.600
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're kind of stuck to the problem in </v>

475
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.521
<v Speaker 2>the Middle East and who knows how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>judge whether we're doing better or </v>

476
00:26:15.371 --> 00:26:17.680
<v Speaker 2>poorer than we were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

477
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to go a year ago,</v>

478
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.430
<v Speaker 2>five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to say.</v>

479
00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:28.710
<v Speaker 1>It's funny you say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't expecting that answer because </v>

480
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.710
<v Speaker 1>it leads you to the next question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

481
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:32.961
<v Speaker 1>if you can't figure out how you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you really don't have any </v>

482
00:26:32.961 --> 00:26:33.930
<v Speaker 1>options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're totally stuck.</v>

483
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember being told a long time ago by</v>

484
00:26:36.571 --> 00:26:41.571
<v Speaker 1>my stepfather who was trying to explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me the wide range of presidential </v>

485
00:26:41.571 --> 00:26:44.550
<v Speaker 1>actions that I always assumed was </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible was a myth.</v>

486
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:46.590
<v Speaker 1>And that when you actually got into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>office,</v>

487
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:51.240
<v Speaker 1>it was really much more constrained by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by what your predecessor left you,</v>

488
00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:52.620
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of other things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

489
00:26:52.621 --> 00:26:57.621
<v Speaker 1>I can't fight the Vietnam war the way I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want because the Soviet Union might get </v>

490
00:26:57.621 --> 00:26:57.621
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

491
00:26:57.621 --> 00:27:01.520
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the current,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it the war on terror </v>

492
00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.000
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see.</v>

493
00:27:03.001 --> 00:27:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you get out of that when,</v>

494
00:27:04.561 --> 00:27:04.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

495
00:27:04.981 --> 00:27:06.270
<v Speaker 1>the old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old equation,</v>

496
00:27:06.271 --> 00:27:11.271
<v Speaker 1>which is it costs these elements that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're fighting pennies on the dollar </v>

497
00:27:11.271 --> 00:27:13.350
<v Speaker 1>compared to what it costs for us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter them.</v>

498
00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean the longterm graphing out of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation looks horrible.</v>

499
00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.100
<v Speaker 1>If you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

500
00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:23.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we could be doing a </v>

501
00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:24.510
<v Speaker 1>documentary with Ken Burns 150 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ken Burns years from now having the same</v>

502
00:27:24.511 --> 00:27:27.090
<v Speaker 1>conversation about the current situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in,</v>

503
00:27:27.091 --> 00:27:32.091
<v Speaker 1>in the war on terror that I just saw the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other night when I was watching the </v>

504
00:27:32.091 --> 00:27:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam war documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that's the case,</v>

505
00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:37.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get this feeling like Deja Vu all </v>

506
00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:40.011
<v Speaker 1>over again or a train wreck that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen before and that it's happening in </v>

507
00:27:40.011 --> 00:27:44.121
<v Speaker 1>slow motion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're finding out exactly how </v>

508
00:27:44.121 --> 00:27:45.630
<v Speaker 1>limited the people in the late sixties </v>
<v Speaker 1>were in terms of their options.</v>

509
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Does it feel like that to you at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or does it seem like a tough.</v>

510
00:27:48.271 --> 00:27:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Because the context of the Cold War and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that is so different.</v>

511
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how similar to you would you feel if you</v>

512
00:27:54.031 --> 00:27:57.690
<v Speaker 1>were a president in office in Lyndon </v>
<v Speaker 1>Baines Johnson's chair versus,</v>

513
00:27:57.691 --> 00:27:59.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump's chair.</v>

514
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Don't ask me that one.</v>

515
00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can go back and see if it makes it </v>

516
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:08.940
<v Speaker 1>easier.</v>

517
00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:14.490
<v Speaker 2>Key issue is how do you define factory?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another way of saying what,</v>

518
00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:18.480
<v Speaker 2>what's our purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's our goal?</v>

519
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.370
<v Speaker 2>If you tell me what our purpose is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Middle East,</v>

520
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:28.820
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you how we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You tell me how to define victory in the</v>

521
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:33.950
<v Speaker 2>Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you whether we're on the </v>

522
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:35.360
<v Speaker 2>10 yard line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 15 yard line and 50 yard line where </v>

523
00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.940
<v Speaker 2>we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't recall anybody ever saying,</v>

524
00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.850
<v Speaker 2>here's our objective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's,</v>

525
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.880
<v Speaker 2>here's how we would define victory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't have a definition of </v>

526
00:28:47.431 --> 00:28:52.431
<v Speaker 2>victory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you don't know when to quit or our </v>

527
00:28:52.431 --> 00:28:54.000
<v Speaker 2>window retire or how to get out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

528
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.930
<v Speaker 2>because you can't tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

529
00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.500
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd like to.</v>

530
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:02.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George W dot Bush famously went on a </v>

531
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.460
<v Speaker 2>aircraft carrier instead under a sign </v>
<v Speaker 2>that said mission accomplished.</v>

532
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:09.270
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was how many years ago?</v>

533
00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:13.560
<v Speaker 2>So at least 15.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're still in Iraq.</v>

534
00:29:13.561 --> 00:29:18.561
<v Speaker 2>If our mission was accomplished when </v>
<v Speaker 2>George W dot Bush went on that boat and </v>

535
00:29:18.571 --> 00:29:23.571
<v Speaker 2>declared victory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the heck are we still doing in </v>

536
00:29:23.571 --> 00:29:23.571
<v Speaker 2>Iraq?</v>

537
00:29:23.571 --> 00:29:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Well then you get back to your question </v>
<v Speaker 1>though about is this is everything we're</v>

538
00:29:28.251 --> 00:29:30.440
<v Speaker 1>facing now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a bit of blowback.</v>

539
00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:35.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we stir up a hornet's nest and we're </v>

540
00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:38.321
<v Speaker 1>still dealing with individual Hornets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would have been better had we </v>

541
00:29:38.321 --> 00:29:38.321
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

542
00:29:38.321 --> 00:29:42.230
<v Speaker 1>the Hornet and chief Saddam Hussein in </v>
<v Speaker 1>charge because at least we weren't the </v>

543
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.230
<v Speaker 1>ones who had pick up the pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

544
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I guess you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what amateur armchair historians like </v>

545
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:50.491
<v Speaker 1>yours truly do general as you almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly know as we look at these and </v>

546
00:29:50.491 --> 00:29:52.060
<v Speaker 1>we try to find meaning from the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this,</v>

547
00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.310
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this horrible fool's game.</v>

548
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:54.980
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

549
00:29:54.981 --> 00:29:55.900
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at this,</v>

550
00:29:55.901 --> 00:29:56.560
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

551
00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:02.410
<v Speaker 1>you almost get to a point where you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would Saddam Hussein and the Middle East</v>

552
00:30:02.411 --> 00:30:06.910
<v Speaker 1>we had in 1991 be an applicable trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a modern politician would,</v>

553
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:09.250
<v Speaker 1>would trade today if they could get back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that?</v>

554
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

555
00:30:12.041 --> 00:30:17.041
<v Speaker 2>I would have traded at the time I wrote </v>
<v Speaker 2>an op Ed pieces and made speeches </v>

556
00:30:17.591 --> 00:30:21.580
<v Speaker 2>against Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It drove me out of the Republican Party.</v>

557
00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:26.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up supporting Obama in 2008.</v>

558
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:33.570
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the national culture of his </v>

559
00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:36.740
<v Speaker 2>presidential campaign and the issue for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me was how badly a that whole thing had </v>

560
00:30:42.221 --> 00:30:47.221
<v Speaker 2>been handled and putting my buddy Colin </v>
<v Speaker 2>Powell going in front of the General </v>

561
00:30:47.221 --> 00:30:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Assembly and making outrageous claims </v>
<v Speaker 2>claims.</v>

562
00:30:49.571 --> 00:30:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Did I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I knew.</v>

563
00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.440
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>

564
00:30:53.441 --> 00:30:58.441
<v Speaker 2>we're wrong about Saddam Hussein's </v>
<v Speaker 2>having weapons of mass destruction or </v>

565
00:30:59.621 --> 00:31:01.720
<v Speaker 2>the other lies that were told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

566
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:06.220
<v Speaker 2>Saddam Hussein and bin Ladin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're good buddies.</v>

567
00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.970
<v Speaker 2>Bologna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't any al Qaeda in Iraq,</v>

568
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
<v Speaker 2>as long as the dom was saying was they </v>
<v Speaker 2>hated each other or that we would be </v>

569
00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:17.220
<v Speaker 2>welcomed as liberator's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

570
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:20.690
<v Speaker 2>people would throw bouquets of roses as </v>
<v Speaker 2>our guys going into Baghdad.</v>

571
00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Bologna as it turned out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said that it's a diamond and you </v>

572
00:31:26.141 --> 00:31:31.141
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a trillion dollars later and thousands </v>

573
00:31:31.141 --> 00:31:33.901
<v Speaker 2>of lives later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're stuck with in Iraq that is much </v>

574
00:31:33.901 --> 00:31:37.460
<v Speaker 2>worse than what it was when Saddam </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hussein was running it.</v>

575
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.460
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

576
00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:44.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real issue here is what are our </v>

577
00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:45.460
<v Speaker 2>purposes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we define victory?</v>

578
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:50.970
<v Speaker 2>What limitations are we going to put on </v>
<v Speaker 2>our use of violence to achieve these </v>

579
00:31:51.131 --> 00:31:54.580
<v Speaker 2>purposes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are very deep questions,</v>

580
00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:58.270
<v Speaker 2>very hard questions to answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

581
00:31:58.271 --> 00:32:00.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then frankly,</v>

582
00:32:00.101 --> 00:32:05.101
<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most presidents need as much help as </v>

583
00:32:05.101 --> 00:32:06.070
<v Speaker 2>possible to get to these answers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they need help from,</v>

584
00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wise and good military advisors,</v>

585
00:32:09.581 --> 00:32:11.920
<v Speaker 2>which I don't think they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always get.</v>

586
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:18.900
<v Speaker 1>You were just talking a second ago about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colin Powell respected military </v>

587
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.020
<v Speaker 1>authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but using that authority,</v>

588
00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:21.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

589
00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:26.120
<v Speaker 1>as part of an effort to sell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>American people and the world on,</v>

590
00:32:26.121 --> 00:32:29.240
<v Speaker 1>on a particular foreign policy move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it occurs to me,</v>

591
00:32:29.241 --> 00:32:30.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that,</v>

592
00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:35.250
<v Speaker 1>that watching the Ken Burns Vietnam </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary really brings home is the </v>

593
00:32:35.511 --> 00:32:38.960
<v Speaker 1>context of what a different America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was back in the,</v>

594
00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.880
<v Speaker 1>when Vietnam was heating up the early 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties.</v>

595
00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I was born during the Yod rang battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

596
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:48.450
<v Speaker 1>so 1965 when things are really heating </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with ground troops.</v>

597
00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government at that time was assumed </v>

598
00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.910
<v Speaker 1>to be telling the truth by just about </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

599
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:58.320
<v Speaker 1>It was a black and white good and evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

600
00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

601
00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.190
<v Speaker 1>I always tell young people when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to them,</v>

602
00:33:02.191 --> 00:33:07.191
<v Speaker 1>I always bring up the first world war </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I talk about a generation of people </v>

603
00:33:07.191 --> 00:33:07.250
<v Speaker 1>that could watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

604
00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:08.820
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unit in front of them,</v>

605
00:33:08.821 --> 00:33:13.821
<v Speaker 1>step out of the trenches and go over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top and be machined gun within 10 yards </v>

606
00:33:13.821 --> 00:33:13.821
<v Speaker 1>of the trench.</v>

607
00:33:13.821 --> 00:33:16.200
<v Speaker 1>And then the next wave will do the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

608
00:33:16.201 --> 00:33:20.070
<v Speaker 1>And I said we wouldn't do that today in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way that much of the stuff that</v>

609
00:33:20.071 --> 00:33:24.360
<v Speaker 1>in 1962 era American would've considered</v>
<v Speaker 1>a truism,</v>

610
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:27.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be much more skeptically by a 21st</v>

611
00:33:27.871 --> 00:33:30.170
<v Speaker 1>century American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much did you know the,</v>

612
00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:35.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so called credibility gap over several </v>

613
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:37.791
<v Speaker 1>administrations in that era,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know lasting the boy who cried </v>

614
00:33:37.861 --> 00:33:42.861
<v Speaker 1>wolf type damage to our government's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to be trusted with statements </v>

615
00:33:43.051 --> 00:33:45.780
<v Speaker 1>like how the war is going or anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else?</v>

616
00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:49.080
<v Speaker 1>What did we sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did we lose our innocence?</v>

617
00:33:49.081 --> 00:33:51.390
<v Speaker 1>I guess as a classic phrase from my 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>

618
00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>military history class?</v>

619
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:57.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in particular,</v>

620
00:33:57.721 --> 00:34:02.721
<v Speaker 2>the Pentagon papers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

621
00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:09.090
<v Speaker 2>after they were published in the New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York Times,</v>

622
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:12.390
<v Speaker 2>The Washington Post,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

623
00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Americans came to understand that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>succession of administrations,</v>

624
00:34:19.561 --> 00:34:24.561
<v Speaker 2>both Democrat and Republican had </v>
<v Speaker 2>systematically lied to the American </v>

625
00:34:25.381 --> 00:34:30.381
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think that was that our </v>

626
00:34:30.381 --> 00:34:34.200
<v Speaker 2>country has ever been the same again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the skepticism,</v>

627
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:40.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which that whole episode properly </v>

628
00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.360
<v Speaker 2>aroused has been with us ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I frankly,</v>

629
00:34:45.361 --> 00:34:48.590
<v Speaker 2>it is a loss of medicines for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

630
00:34:48.591 --> 00:34:53.591
<v Speaker 2>and if you look at our history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were never a great power until after </v>

631
00:34:53.591 --> 00:34:55.590
<v Speaker 2>World War One.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So our,</v>

632
00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:57.210
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

633
00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:01.170
<v Speaker 2>experience on the world stage was pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>limited,</v>

634
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:02.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

635
00:35:02.791 --> 00:35:07.791
<v Speaker 2>maybe 50 years of experience as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a real actor in international </v>

636
00:35:07.791 --> 00:35:10.120
<v Speaker 2>affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then finally we,</v>

637
00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:14.450
<v Speaker 2>we woke up a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we saw how that sort of thing happens.</v>

638
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.540
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government weren't cynical before.</v>

639
00:35:18.541 --> 00:35:22.560
<v Speaker 2>I think the Brits were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the British government has been cynical,</v>

640
00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:23.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a long time,</v>

641
00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:29.760
<v Speaker 2>but Americans were truly a children of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the frontier,</v>

642
00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:31.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

643
00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:32.910
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a sort of a,</v>

644
00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:39.290
<v Speaker 2>a Western heritage frontier parentage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we wanted to believe that our </v>

645
00:35:42.241 --> 00:35:47.241
<v Speaker 2>government was telling the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we learned in the Pentagon papers </v>

646
00:35:47.241 --> 00:35:48.810
<v Speaker 2>that that's not so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And ever since we've been,</v>

647
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:51.360
<v Speaker 2>I think properly skeptical.</v>

648
00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.670
<v Speaker 1>I guess the logical question is why do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

649
00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:02.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the tendency would be to blame </v>

650
00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:03.480
<v Speaker 1>some president from the opposite </v>
<v Speaker 1>political party and,</v>

651
00:36:03.481 --> 00:36:05.410
<v Speaker 1>and demonize them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as you said,</v>

652
00:36:05.411 --> 00:36:10.411
<v Speaker 1>this was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a multi administration effort to keep </v>

653
00:36:10.411 --> 00:36:14.160
<v Speaker 1>from the people who are supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what's going on so they can </v>

654
00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.090
<v Speaker 1>be informed voters from really knowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>

655
00:36:16.091 --> 00:36:17.810
<v Speaker 1>And it started with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

656
00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Eisenhower even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even to the end with Nixon and </v>

657
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:23.780
<v Speaker 1>Christmas bombings that were secret.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

658
00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:25.290
<v Speaker 1>what was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

659
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:30.630
<v Speaker 1>was it kept secret in your mind for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for military reasons or was it kept </v>

660
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:34.951
<v Speaker 1>secret because the reaction of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>American people to their own policies </v>

661
00:36:34.951 --> 00:36:36.490
<v Speaker 1>was what the government was worried </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

662
00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:41.620
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the latter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

663
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:47.510
<v Speaker 2>The government didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The president didn't want to be </v>

664
00:36:47.531 --> 00:36:52.531
<v Speaker 2>embarrassed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Embarrassment is the worst possible </v>

665
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:57.990
<v Speaker 2>situation for a public figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the bombing of Cambodia,</v>

666
00:36:58.331 --> 00:37:01.180
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a secret from the American people.</v>

667
00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:06.480
<v Speaker 2>It's sure as hell wasn't secret from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cambodians what are the north Vietnamese</v>

668
00:37:06.611 --> 00:37:09.280
<v Speaker 2>army,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was using Cambodia for sanctuary.</v>

669
00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:12.340
<v Speaker 2>They knew all about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the secrecy,</v>

670
00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:15.700
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't a military necessity at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

671
00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.670
<v Speaker 2>The enemy quite understood what was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

672
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:20.200
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

673
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:24.310
<v Speaker 2>the secrecy was required to keep the </v>
<v Speaker 2>American people in the dark.</v>

674
00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:29.850
<v Speaker 2>And the only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only reason for that is the </v>

675
00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:31.240
<v Speaker 2>government would have been embarrassed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to admit what was going on.</v>

676
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:35.210
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst possible reason to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

677
00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:39.250
<v Speaker 2>classify a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any information is to protect,</v>

678
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.570
<v Speaker 2>to protect yourself from embarrassment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's exactly what was going on.</v>

679
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the efforts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>media today are.</v>

680
00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:52.920
<v Speaker 1>I want to compare them to the media </v>
<v Speaker 1>efforts in Vietnam,</v>

681
00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:57.921
<v Speaker 1>which we're so scrutinized and yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps so influential on what went on </v>

682
00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:03.110
<v Speaker 1>and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even sure we're talking apples </v>

683
00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:03.110
<v Speaker 1>and oranges here in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the ability to compare them,</v>

684
00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:07.940
<v Speaker 1>but how would you compare today's media </v>
<v Speaker 1>coverage of America's conflicts and </v>

685
00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.300
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

686
00:38:09.301 --> 00:38:10.500
<v Speaker 1>take 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>67,</v>

687
00:38:10.501 --> 00:38:12.780
<v Speaker 1>68?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it was very different in 62,</v>

688
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:16.440
<v Speaker 1>but how would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you compare the media's job,</v>

689
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:19.680
<v Speaker 1>how they cover with the restrictions by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that we understand?</v>

690
00:38:19.681 --> 00:38:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean they don't have the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to show this.</v>

691
00:38:22.201 --> 00:38:24.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean the combat footage that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

692
00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:29.210
<v Speaker 1>not to change the subject but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that rocked me in Ken </v>

693
00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Burns' documentary the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have no idea how he did it,</v>

694
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:35.630
<v Speaker 1>is there's segments where you'll see 35 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds in a row of that looks like it </v>

695
00:38:35.981 --> 00:38:38.920
<v Speaker 1>was shot yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high definition stuff.</v>

696
00:38:38.921 --> 00:38:43.921
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people like me who've seen a lot of </v>

697
00:38:43.921 --> 00:38:46.021
<v Speaker 1>that footage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't figure out if it's computer </v>

698
00:38:46.021 --> 00:38:46.021
<v Speaker 1>enhanced or what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

699
00:38:46.021 --> 00:38:50.010
<v Speaker 1>but when you're looking at what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>media is able to show back then and the </v>

700
00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:52.810
<v Speaker 1>difference in the coverage today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you compare in your mind's eye,</v>

701
00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:58.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pros and cons of the way we did it </v>

702
00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:58.060
<v Speaker 1>then and how we do it now?</v>

703
00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Media coverage in Vietnam was by and </v>
<v Speaker 2>large positive in my opinion,</v>

704
00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:16.780
<v Speaker 2>except for photo coverage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

705
00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:17.660
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

706
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:22.750
<v Speaker 2>the impact of a photograph or today </v>
<v Speaker 2>video is so much more,</v>

707
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:29.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pervasive or influential or stocking </v>

708
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:34.190
<v Speaker 2>know you got a photograph of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a police general in Saigon shooting </v>

709
00:39:34.671 --> 00:39:38.080
<v Speaker 2>or a guy in the head or a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a,</v>

710
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:42.500
<v Speaker 2>a very young girl running away from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>village.</v>

711
00:39:42.501 --> 00:39:46.970
<v Speaker 2>It's been an avon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether skin on fire these pictures,</v>

712
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:52.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>convey a message in a way that written </v>

713
00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:53.120
<v Speaker 2>journalism or broadcast journalism </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot.</v>

714
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:55.790
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were very negative.</v>

715
00:39:56.180 --> 00:40:00.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean a Buddhist monks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

716
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:05.290
<v Speaker 2>emulating themselves in the streets of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Saigon when you show that you show it on</v>

717
00:40:05.691 --> 00:40:10.691
<v Speaker 2>television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just is merciless and the message it </v>

718
00:40:10.691 --> 00:40:13.370
<v Speaker 2>can base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for my money,</v>

719
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:15.850
<v Speaker 2>until Walter Cronkite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

720
00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.590
<v Speaker 2>came on CBS news and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

721
00:40:18.591 --> 00:40:19.830
<v Speaker 2>we're not winning guys.</v>

722
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.060
<v Speaker 2>After 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

723
00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:28.260
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coverage was pretty universally </v>

724
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:28.970
<v Speaker 2>supportive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The written coverage,</v>

725
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:32.700
<v Speaker 2>but the photographic coverage underlie </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

726
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:33.770
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

727
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:36.500
<v Speaker 2>undermined everything that was being </v>
<v Speaker 2>said in print.</v>

728
00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Now today it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coverage is much more visual,</v>

729
00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:46.190
<v Speaker 2>much more video oriented and photo </v>
<v Speaker 2>oriented.</v>

730
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:52.150
<v Speaker 2>And so the bad news hits earlier I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>because photo,</v>

731
00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:56.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't see a photograph of,</v>

732
00:40:57.310 --> 00:41:01.430
<v Speaker 2>of a ribbon cutting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it has downtown Baghdad is liberated.</v>

733
00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:07.180
<v Speaker 2>You see these awful scenes of devastated</v>
<v Speaker 2>towns that we're creating in the Middle </v>

734
00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.230
<v Speaker 2>East.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's no getting around it.</v>

735
00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.460
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in a large scale destructive mode.</v>

736
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:19.790
<v Speaker 2>They're in the Middle East and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what people are seeing.</v>

737
00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:21.850
<v Speaker 2>They're not seeing any upside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

738
00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:26.510
<v Speaker 2>you can talk about upside all you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how well we're doing and so forth.</v>

739
00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:31.540
<v Speaker 2>But what we are seeing is awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The consequences of combat there.</v>

740
00:41:32.121 --> 00:41:37.121
<v Speaker 2>And so I think the coverage today is </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more pessimistic and skeptical and </v>

741
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:47.230
<v Speaker 2>even perhaps a cynical but because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are showing not just telling and from </v>

742
00:41:50.091 --> 00:41:52.550
<v Speaker 2>now on I expect that's a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>coverage will be.</v>

743
00:41:52.551 --> 00:41:54.050
<v Speaker 2>Because this gentleman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

744
00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:59.060
<v Speaker 2>our younger generation is much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>video oriented and won't read the New </v>

745
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:01.340
<v Speaker 2>York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch it on,</v>

746
00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:03.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on facebook.</v>

747
00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once upon a time it used to be Radio </v>

748
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Free Europe trying to get a little teeny</v>
<v Speaker 1>signal over the iron curtain.</v>

749
00:42:11.621 --> 00:42:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Now that if we were fighting the north </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnamese army,</v>

750
00:42:14.021 --> 00:42:16.000
<v Speaker 1>they would have a troll of people on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>

751
00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:21.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving their side of the story or </v>

752
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.270
<v Speaker 1>pretending to be Americans</v>

753
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.920
<v Speaker 2>complete with photographs.</v>

754
00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Fake photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

755
00:42:25.571 --> 00:42:26.470
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

756
00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Well then let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you a little bit of not </v>

757
00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.901
<v Speaker 1>really changing subjects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't have a four star general on </v>

758
00:42:33.901 --> 00:42:36.430
<v Speaker 1>here without mining you a little bit for</v>
<v Speaker 1>some knowledge and wisdom myself.</v>

759
00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at Syria and I'm looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had talked about,</v>

760
00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:42.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in destructive mode right now,</v>

761
00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:47.700
<v Speaker 1>but to have an arm chair person like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a terribly small theater </v>

762
00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:53.550
<v Speaker 1>to have that many different forces </v>
<v Speaker 1>operating in and us hoping to keep </v>

763
00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:55.870
<v Speaker 1>everything clean with no major mistakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and whatnot.</v>

764
00:42:56.170 --> 00:43:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had talked about North Korea as </v>

765
00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:03.931
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you talk to me a little about those </v>

766
00:43:03.931 --> 00:43:06.541
<v Speaker 1>two hot spots and if there's a third one</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would add to the mix of places we </v>

767
00:43:06.541 --> 00:43:06.541
<v Speaker 1>need to be careful right now</v>

768
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:13.990
<v Speaker 2>is the most important and threatening </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem that we face anywhere in the </v>

769
00:43:16.091 --> 00:43:21.091
<v Speaker 2>world or have faced for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think we're up against a,</v>

770
00:43:21.331 --> 00:43:26.331
<v Speaker 2>a sort of a Cuban missile crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's been that long since we've </v>

771
00:43:28.181 --> 00:43:33.181
<v Speaker 2>really been looked down the barrel gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>drill as far as Syria goes.</v>

772
00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is an awfully small theater of </v>

773
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:39.430
<v Speaker 2>operations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially on the air side.</v>

774
00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.440
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about aircraft like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

775
00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.850
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] that that's super cruise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

776
00:43:45.851 --> 00:43:50.851
<v Speaker 2>there are supersonic there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're running around the sky at one </v>

777
00:43:50.851 --> 00:43:54.331
<v Speaker 2>point seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one point eight bucks all the time and </v>

778
00:43:54.331 --> 00:43:57.460
<v Speaker 2>that makes Syria pretty small countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>even do a one,</v>

779
00:43:57.461 --> 00:44:00.250
<v Speaker 2>a two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 180 degree turn in,</v>

780
00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Russians are,</v>

781
00:44:02.141 --> 00:44:07.141
<v Speaker 2>they're sharing that airspace now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've so far been able to coordinate </v>

782
00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:13.050
<v Speaker 2>that air activity pretty well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the Russians did lose a </v>

783
00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:16.780
<v Speaker 2>fighter to a circuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a target or a ground fire.</v>

784
00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:18.670
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the less,</v>

785
00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:23.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're running a head to head against </v>

786
00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:26.880
<v Speaker 2>each other in a very small airspace and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a tribute to the professionalism of</v>

787
00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:33.030
<v Speaker 2>our air force that we haven't already </v>
<v Speaker 2>shot down a few of those guys.</v>

788
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

789
00:44:35.371 --> 00:44:37.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's terribly dangerous.</v>

790
00:44:37.021 --> 00:44:42.021
<v Speaker 2>We could be any day involved in a head </v>
<v Speaker 2>to head fight with Russian aircraft and </v>

791
00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.760
<v Speaker 2>where that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

792
00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:50.400
<v Speaker 2>that that's got the potential to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to escalate,</v>

793
00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:54.870
<v Speaker 2>to go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's dangerous in my opinion.</v>

794
00:44:54.871 --> 00:44:59.871
<v Speaker 2>It's less dangerous than the situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>in North Korea where we have apparently </v>

795
00:45:00.091 --> 00:45:05.091
<v Speaker 2>a crazy guy in charge of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a government that is the,</v>

796
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:10.710
<v Speaker 2>does possess nuclear weapons and is </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapidly developing the capability if it </v>

797
00:45:11.371 --> 00:45:16.371
<v Speaker 2>doesn't already have them to deliver </v>
<v Speaker 2>those nuclear weapons against American </v>

798
00:45:16.371 --> 00:45:17.300
<v Speaker 2>cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

799
00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:22.310
<v Speaker 2>I think that's an awful situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we can't allow that to continue.</v>

800
00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:27.530
<v Speaker 2>I believe we must intervene and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something there.</v>

801
00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.520
<v Speaker 2>Now what should we do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

802
00:45:29.521 --> 00:45:33.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm in favor of using all the tools in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the toolbox.</v>

803
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.120
<v Speaker 2>If you think diplomacy will work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by all means,</v>

804
00:45:36.121 --> 00:45:38.400
<v Speaker 2>let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think we can,</v>

805
00:45:38.401 --> 00:45:38.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

806
00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:42.030
<v Speaker 2>economic sanctions will work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's impose them.</v>

807
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:46.880
<v Speaker 2>If you think the Chinese can help us or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Russians can help us.</v>

808
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I all means let's involve them.</v>

809
00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:55.640
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we've tried just about </v>

810
00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:58.221
<v Speaker 2>everything here and nothing has worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>so far because what we have to do is </v>

811
00:45:58.471 --> 00:46:02.220
<v Speaker 2>dismantle its nuclear capability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can allow,</v>

812
00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:07.490
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>North Korea to continue to develop a </v>

813
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.610
<v Speaker 2>nuclear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

814
00:46:08.611 --> 00:46:13.611
<v Speaker 2>me threats against the American American</v>
<v Speaker 2>homeland,</v>

815
00:46:14.191 --> 00:46:19.080
<v Speaker 2>property and citizens and institutions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so forth that,</v>

816
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:24.380
<v Speaker 2>that has to be dismantled and I believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be dismantled relatively </v>

817
00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:28.881
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have forever to deal with this </v>

818
00:46:28.881 --> 00:46:30.680
<v Speaker 2>problem or it will get to a point where </v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't deal with it now.</v>

819
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:35.690
<v Speaker 2>I think we should deal with it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>conventional weapons and I rather than </v>

820
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:41.270
<v Speaker 2>use nuclear weapons against North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think we still have the capability</v>

821
00:46:42.301 --> 00:46:44.600
<v Speaker 2>to do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just to help the,</v>

822
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:47.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>them dismantled its capability.</v>

823
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to get with it pretty soon </v>

824
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.750
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

825
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time's running out on him.</v>

826
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:57.310
<v Speaker 1>Go back to some of the constraints maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a guy like Johnson was operating </v>

827
00:46:57.310 --> 00:47:01.691
<v Speaker 1>under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if the Chinese or Putin's </v>

828
00:47:01.691 --> 00:47:02.240
<v Speaker 1>government tell us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

829
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:03.170
<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>

830
00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

831
00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:08.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that already.</v>

832
00:47:08.631 --> 00:47:13.631
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but remember the North Korean nuclear </v>

833
00:47:13.631 --> 00:47:15.950
<v Speaker 2>capability is a bigger threat to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Beijing,</v>

834
00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:21.850
<v Speaker 2>a bigger threat of glad of a stock and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is to Honolulu or Chicago,</v>

835
00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:29.080
<v Speaker 2>so there's every reason to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would wish to cooperate us.</v>

836
00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:32.320
<v Speaker 2>If not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then so be it.</v>

837
00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:33.300
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

838
00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:37.570
<v Speaker 2>we have the means to deter China and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia.</v>

839
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:42.220
<v Speaker 2>We've shown that already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is we don't,</v>

840
00:47:42.221 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 2>I think know for sure or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or with great enough probability that we</v>

841
00:47:46.511 --> 00:47:49.960
<v Speaker 2>can deter North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

842
00:47:49.961 --> 00:47:54.961
<v Speaker 2>I've heard it argued that this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kim Jong Gun is a rational person.</v>

843
00:47:56.830 --> 00:48:01.540
<v Speaker 2>All he wants to do is hold power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore he has something to lose.</v>

844
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:06.280
<v Speaker 2>Therefore he detour trouble and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably right.</v>

845
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:09.820
<v Speaker 2>My question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if it's well,</v>

846
00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.970
<v Speaker 2>what are the odds that he's not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible?</v>

847
00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Say there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say it's only 10 percent,</v>

848
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:19.280
<v Speaker 2>so do we want to make it a bit?</v>

849
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to bet Chicago or New York City </v>

850
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:29.100
<v Speaker 2>that he's deterrent will when the odds </v>
<v Speaker 2>are 10 percent say that he's not the </v>

851
00:48:29.231 --> 00:48:32.320
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we want to take that bet.</v>

852
00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:37.770
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the overview ought to be here about </v>

853
00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:41.680
<v Speaker 2>nuclear proliferation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are we going to draw the line?</v>

854
00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Is it okay for Nigeria or Honduras or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bailey's to have nuclear weapons?</v>

855
00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:58.590
<v Speaker 2>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the point of which we are going </v>

856
00:48:58.590 --> 00:48:58.590
<v Speaker 2>to put our foot down and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

857
00:48:58.590 --> 00:48:59.980
<v Speaker 2>we've gone far enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

858
00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:05.140
<v Speaker 2>it's enough that 10 or so countries that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are acting responsibly so far have </v>

859
00:49:06.731 --> 00:49:11.731
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's enough where the world is </v>

860
00:49:11.731 --> 00:49:11.731
<v Speaker 2>dangerous enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

861
00:49:11.731 --> 00:49:16.620
<v Speaker 2>without a Astonia having a full up </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear delivery capability.</v>

862
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:19.210
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in any case,</v>

863
00:49:19.211 --> 00:49:24.211
<v Speaker 2>we now have a case which I think is as </v>
<v Speaker 2>clear as can be that says we need to </v>

864
00:49:27.701 --> 00:49:32.701
<v Speaker 2>stop this process here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If America possesses armed forces for </v>

865
00:49:35.021 --> 00:49:40.021
<v Speaker 2>any reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is to protect the property and the </v>

866
00:49:40.021 --> 00:49:44.311
<v Speaker 2>institutions and the lives of Americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>against threats like North Korea as a </v>

867
00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:51.300
<v Speaker 2>nuclear armed North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe we ought to draw the line and </v>

868
00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:56.550
<v Speaker 2>we ought to give a deadline by one </v>
<v Speaker 2>January next year.</v>

869
00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:03.030
<v Speaker 2>Either the new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the North Koreans are dismantling this </v>

870
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:06.631
<v Speaker 2>capability under international </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspection or we will help dismantle it.</v>

871
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:12.620
<v Speaker 1>It's funny you jumped the gun and went </v>
<v Speaker 1>right to my next question,</v>

872
00:50:12.621 --> 00:50:15.680
<v Speaker 1>which was about nuclear nonproliferation</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I wanted to ask you,</v>

873
00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:18.940
<v Speaker 1>is it specifically in North Korean </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem or is it a,</v>

874
00:50:18.941 --> 00:50:21.050
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mentioned believes,</v>

875
00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:21.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

876
00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Is it a beliefs problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's my question though.</v>

877
00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:29.590
<v Speaker 1>This reminds me a little of like certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>naval treaties between the two world </v>

878
00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:31.500
<v Speaker 1>wars where we're telling certain powers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

879
00:50:31.501 --> 00:50:35.120
<v Speaker 1>this is 70 plus year old technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

880
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:37.040
<v Speaker 1>the basis for nuclear weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

881
00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

882
00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:43.070
<v Speaker 1>and when you're telling other countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can never develop that </v>

883
00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:46.451
<v Speaker 1>capability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't that the equivalent of locking </v>

884
00:50:46.451 --> 00:50:49.310
<v Speaker 1>them into second power status </v>
<v Speaker 1>permanently in the way that the,</v>

885
00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:52.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese had to have six battleships</v>

886
00:50:52.371 --> 00:50:54.710
<v Speaker 1>to every 10 British battleships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

887
00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:55.360
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

888
00:50:55.590 --> 00:51:00.590
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be the farther we get away </v>

889
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:00.590
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from when that technology was invented,</v>

890
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:02.630
<v Speaker 1>the weirder it gets to tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

891
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:07.750
<v Speaker 1>you can have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But something that was invented darn </v>

892
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:10.241
<v Speaker 1>near 100 years ago is that she should </v>
<v Speaker 1>the foreign policy of the country be </v>

893
00:51:10.241 --> 00:51:14.351
<v Speaker 1>that no nuclear powers that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently nuclear powers should be </v>

894
00:51:14.351 --> 00:51:15.170
<v Speaker 1>allowed to become nuclear powers.</v>

895
00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:21.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the foreign policy of nuclear zero that </v>

896
00:51:23.041 --> 00:51:26.640
<v Speaker 2>we would like to see a world without </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons.</v>

897
00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:32.090
<v Speaker 2>We would be much safer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean our superiority and conventional </v>

898
00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:37.041
<v Speaker 2>warfare is so pronounced that if nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons disappeared everywhere in the </v>

899
00:51:38.881 --> 00:51:41.700
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would improve the safety and security</v>

900
00:51:41.701 --> 00:51:46.701
<v Speaker 2>of the American people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so our policy ought to be a zero </v>

901
00:51:48.421 --> 00:51:51.480
<v Speaker 2>nuclear weapons for anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

902
00:51:51.510 --> 00:51:56.510
<v Speaker 2>how do we get there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea because a country like </v>

903
00:51:56.510 --> 00:52:00.681
<v Speaker 2>say Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which commonly is understood to possess </v>

904
00:52:00.681 --> 00:52:04.101
<v Speaker 2>an inventory of nuclear weapons is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to renounce them a given its </v>

905
00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.560
<v Speaker 2>security situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

906
00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:12.600
<v Speaker 2>and the geography lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know if a practical way to </v>

907
00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.240
<v Speaker 2>get to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it ought to be our objective and</v>

908
00:52:15.241 --> 00:52:19.830
<v Speaker 2>I think we ought to work on it and try </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get there and eventually hopefully we</v>

909
00:52:19.831 --> 00:52:20.790
<v Speaker 2>can get there.</v>

910
00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.940
<v Speaker 2>But that ought to be our policy </v>
<v Speaker 2>objective.</v>

911
00:52:23.941 --> 00:52:28.050
<v Speaker 2>And in the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we ought to say a yes,</v>

912
00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:33.770
<v Speaker 2>nobody else can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have them now is going to get </v>

913
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:38.091
<v Speaker 2>them and it's going to reduce them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>second class status and that's too bad </v>

914
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:42.330
<v Speaker 2>going to have to live with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

915
00:52:42.331 --> 00:52:47.331
<v Speaker 2>the world is increasingly dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more people get that capability.</v>

916
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:53.630
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it does freeze people into a sort of </v>

917
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:58.611
<v Speaker 2>a formulaic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a position like we tried to do with </v>

918
00:52:58.611 --> 00:53:01.620
<v Speaker 2>capital ships at one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember though,</v>

919
00:53:01.621 --> 00:53:03.380
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not the first time we've,</v>

920
00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:06.810
<v Speaker 2>we've outlawed chemical munitions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

921
00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:08.610
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Worldwide,</v>

922
00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:13.640
<v Speaker 2>hopefully and now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we to enforced that a bit so we can,</v>

923
00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:18.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put certain limitations that we hope are</v>

924
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:23.120
<v Speaker 2>universal on the kind of munitions that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are available for use in hostile,</v>

925
00:53:23.121 --> 00:53:24.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>engagements.</v>

926
00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About a conventional</v>

927
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.240
<v Speaker 2>situation then of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>

928
00:53:27.241 --> 00:53:30.090
<v Speaker 2>of a change in power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you look at something like in Iran,</v>

929
00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:31.580
<v Speaker 2>in their region,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

930
00:53:31.581 --> 00:53:36.500
<v Speaker 2>all of us history not to know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that traditionally Iran or Persia is one</v>

931
00:53:36.501 --> 00:53:41.501
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll call them the regional </v>

932
00:53:41.501 --> 00:53:41.501
<v Speaker 2>superpowers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

933
00:53:41.501 --> 00:53:42.200
<v Speaker 2>And they wax and wane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes they dominate the region.</v>

934
00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:47.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like the policy sometimes is </v>

935
00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:50.500
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to let anyone change the</v>
<v Speaker 2>power relationships that are currently </v>

936
00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:52.340
<v Speaker 2>in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a viable,</v>

937
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:55.910
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be a hedge demonic power </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of way of looking at it.</v>

938
00:53:55.911 --> 00:53:58.970
<v Speaker 2>But is that a viable way to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like the Middle East and say,</v>

939
00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.070
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to expand your,</v>

940
00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:06.071
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>influence into Syria even if that's a </v>

941
00:54:06.071 --> 00:54:06.740
<v Speaker 2>traditional Persian area of expansion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you see where I'm going with this?</v>

942
00:54:06.741 --> 00:54:08.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much can we,</v>

943
00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:13.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll call it the United States is the </v>

944
00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.891
<v Speaker 2>tip of the spear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we all represent a bunch of major </v>

945
00:54:14.891 --> 00:54:17.171
<v Speaker 2>powers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much can we be the congress of </v>

946
00:54:17.171 --> 00:54:17.171
<v Speaker 2>Vienna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but constantly,</v>

947
00:54:17.171 --> 00:54:20.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making sure that things stay stable,</v>

948
00:54:20.091 --> 00:54:22.310
<v Speaker 2>we'll call them stable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for lack of a better word.</v>

949
00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:23.730
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear stability,</v>

950
00:54:23.731 --> 00:54:26.660
<v Speaker 2>you're all for what about even like </v>
<v Speaker 2>regional power,</v>

951
00:54:26.661 --> 00:54:27.920
<v Speaker 2>shifting stability?</v>

952
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:35.230
<v Speaker 2>We are no doubt a status quo power </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're the top dog.</v>

953
00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:41.650
<v Speaker 2>So we don't want that to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And hopefully I've never changes.</v>

954
00:54:41.651 --> 00:54:46.651
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this country lasts a thousand years </v>

955
00:54:46.651 --> 00:54:46.651
<v Speaker 2>and we all prayed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

956
00:54:46.651 --> 00:54:48.970
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to be at the top of the heap for</v>

957
00:54:48.971 --> 00:54:53.971
<v Speaker 2>that whole period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

958
00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:59.820
<v Speaker 2>you can't stand up the beaches edge and </v>
<v Speaker 2>an order that tied not to get your feet </v>

959
00:54:59.981 --> 00:55:00.820
<v Speaker 2>wet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

960
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:04.860
<v Speaker 2>so change is inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

961
00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:10.850
<v Speaker 2>what we have to do is to find a </v>
<v Speaker 2>constructive ways to allow change to </v>

962
00:55:13.421 --> 00:55:18.421
<v Speaker 2>occur.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't threaten our position and </v>

963
00:55:18.421 --> 00:55:19.270
<v Speaker 2>there's every reason by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we ought to be able to do that.</v>

964
00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:21.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

965
00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:26.350
<v Speaker 2>certainly the tech technical change that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see in the last,</v>

966
00:55:26.351 --> 00:55:28.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of decades has been led by us.</v>

967
00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:32.730
<v Speaker 2>We've created the instability onto the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

968
00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:37.800
<v Speaker 2>the technological front.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it serves our purposes to be in the </v>

969
00:55:38.051 --> 00:55:43.051
<v Speaker 2>vanguard of change where it's positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just have to figure out where is it </v>

970
00:55:43.901 --> 00:55:45.520
<v Speaker 2>positive negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

971
00:55:45.521 --> 00:55:50.521
<v Speaker 2>in the case of Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's been a long time since there </v>

972
00:55:50.521 --> 00:55:53.910
<v Speaker 2>is the great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

973
00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:55.740
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

974
00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Syria recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly been the Ottoman Empire,</v>

975
00:55:59.241 --> 00:56:03.680
<v Speaker 2>which not version Syria was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a Ottoman province.</v>

976
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:07.040
<v Speaker 2>It was packed up by a</v>

977
00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Yay</v>

978
00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:13.540
<v Speaker 2>at the end of World War One.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

979
00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:16.720
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lebanon was created separately.</v>

980
00:56:16.721 --> 00:56:21.721
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Syria considers Lebanon a Serbian </v>

981
00:56:21.721 --> 00:56:21.721
<v Speaker 2>province,</v>

982
00:56:21.721 --> 00:56:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Christian French enclave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

983
00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:25.920
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

984
00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.120
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

985
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:33.230
<v Speaker 1>the question you asked requires </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophistication in the answering.</v>

986
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:36.730
<v Speaker 1>It required sophistication in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking,</v>

987
00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:39.400
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

988
00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:45.240
<v Speaker 1>so statesmen are judged by their ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to recognize what change is coming </v>

989
00:56:47.291 --> 00:56:50.740
<v Speaker 1>anyway and running around and getting in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of it.</v>

990
00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we define statesmanship and </v>

991
00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:58.600
<v Speaker 1>cheap politicians are defined as people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't understand,</v>

992
00:56:59.130 --> 00:57:04.130
<v Speaker 1>don't understand besides the depth I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>sat here and,</v>

993
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:08.590
<v Speaker 1>and mind you for wisdom on current </v>
<v Speaker 1>affairs and wisdom on the Vietnam War.</v>

994
00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:13.591
<v Speaker 1>At no point did I ask you about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>drama though of flying hundreds of </v>

995
00:57:13.691 --> 00:57:17.730
<v Speaker 1>missions into that situation and what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would assume was a,</v>

996
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:22.750
<v Speaker 1>a more tense situation as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a anti air defenses got stronger and </v>

997
00:57:22.871 --> 00:57:27.871
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the understated question of all </v>

998
00:57:27.871 --> 00:57:31.471
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can you describe to me just for a </v>

999
00:57:31.471 --> 00:57:31.471
<v Speaker 1>second what the heck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1000
00:57:31.471 --> 00:57:33.760
<v Speaker 1>when you look back on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did things that were nothing like what</v>

1001
00:57:33.761 --> 00:57:34.750
<v Speaker 1>you did and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1002
00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:39.751
<v Speaker 1>I was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you ever look back on that and </v>

1003
00:57:39.751 --> 00:57:42.691
<v Speaker 1>just think to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that a different person or is it </v>

1004
00:57:42.691 --> 00:57:43.690
<v Speaker 1>like yesterday for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you miss it?</v>

1005
00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:51.960
<v Speaker 2>Combat is partly because of Hubris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1006
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:58.260
<v Speaker 2>I was arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still am probably.</v>

1007
00:57:58.261 --> 00:58:00.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friends,</v>

1008
00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:05.480
<v Speaker 2>my friends say I was arrogant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I did a strapped into an </v>

1009
00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:06.750
<v Speaker 2>airplane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody can beat me.</v>

1010
00:58:06.751 --> 00:58:07.990
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1011
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.000
<v Speaker 2>I never was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me it wasn't a matter of bravery or </v>

1012
00:58:13.531 --> 00:58:18.531
<v Speaker 2>courage to go out there because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew I was going to kick the crap out </v>

1013
00:58:19.411 --> 00:58:22.140
<v Speaker 2>of the other guy rather than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reverse.</v>

1014
00:58:22.830 --> 00:58:26.540
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>combat I food 285 combat region.</v>

1015
00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:28.710
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved every,</v>

1016
00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:32.250
<v Speaker 2>every minute of it and I miss it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1017
00:58:32.251 --> 00:58:34.320
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really fun.</v>

1018
00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's hard to explain.</v>

1019
00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:41.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am a professional warrior,</v>

1020
00:58:41.341 --> 00:58:42.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

1021
00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:45.480
<v Speaker 2>that's what I was cut out to do and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoyed it a lot.</v>

1022
00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:49.370
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to recommend that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>read your books to get a really,</v>

1023
00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:54.310
<v Speaker 1>a more detailed version of everything we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were just talking about general.</v>

1024
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did I,</v>

1025
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:57.580
<v Speaker 1>did I ask everything you would like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about?</v>

1026
00:58:57.581 --> 00:59:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything that you'd like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring up that I left out?</v>

1027
00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:06.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has been a pretty wide ranging </v>

1028
00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:06.230
<v Speaker 2>conversation and more philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

1029
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:09.390
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm uh,</v>

1030
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.980
<v Speaker 2>equipped to deal with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ask Your questions or are too good.</v>

1031
00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody had including your,</v>

1032
00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:18.550
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1033
00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:24.240
<v Speaker 2>you spoke to the Peloponnesian wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has the answers to these </v>

1034
00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:27.350
<v Speaker 2>questions and they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not good to ask her professional,</v>

1035
00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:29.740
<v Speaker 2>a military guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to.</v>

1036
00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:32.390
<v Speaker 2>These are questions for the philosophy </v>
<v Speaker 2>professor.</v>

1037
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:37.400
<v Speaker 2>Not For me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certainly it's been as wide ranging </v>

1038
00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:38.710
<v Speaker 2>as I could desire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1039
00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.240
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more so than I'm pretty,</v>

1040
00:59:41.241 --> 00:59:43.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any good at handling</v>

<v Speaker 1>you appreciate yourself.</v>

1042
00:59:45.011 --> 00:59:47.620
<v Speaker 1>I tailored those questions after </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching you talk.</v>

1043
00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:52.650
<v Speaker 1>And I think you're absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what's funny is when I met </v>

1044
00:59:52.650 --> 00:59:52.650
<v Speaker 1>General Maddis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that's how he thought to.</v>

1045
00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:55.420
<v Speaker 1>You're very well versed in wide ranging </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1046
00:59:55.890 --> 00:59:57.080
<v Speaker 2>Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks very much.</v>

1047
00:59:57.081 --> 00:59:58.510
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed talking to you buddy.</v>

1048
01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:07.860
<v Speaker 1>My thanks to General Mcpeak for coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the program and putting up with my </v>

1049
01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:09.220
<v Speaker 1>traditionally unusual and long winded </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

1050
01:00:09.790 --> 01:00:12.670
<v Speaker 1>His books are available everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We willing to.</v>

1051
01:00:12.671 --> 01:00:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Some of them on our website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His latest,</v>

1052
01:00:14.321 --> 01:00:16.240
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is roles and missions.</v>

1053
01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:20.830
<v Speaker 1>Cataloging his time as the 14th chief of</v>
<v Speaker 1>staff of the air force.</v>

1054
01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:26.130
<v Speaker 1>He's a fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can agree and I appreciate </v>

1055
01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:26.130
<v Speaker 1>him coming on the program.</v>

1056
01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>I am a true believer in the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading makes you a more formidable </v>

1057
01:00:36.791 --> 01:00:41.380
<v Speaker 1>version of you and it's hard to read </v>
<v Speaker 1>these days,</v>

1058
01:00:41.381 --> 01:00:45.970
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To find time to devote to simply looking</v>

1059
01:00:45.971 --> 01:00:48.430
<v Speaker 1>at a page for hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wonderful.</v>

1060
01:00:48.431 --> 01:00:49.960
<v Speaker 1>I love it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard to do,</v>

1061
01:00:49.961 --> 01:00:51.340
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this busy world,</v>

1062
01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:56.690
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people like to combine things </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to do with things they'd like </v>

1063
01:00:56.690 --> 01:00:57.280
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got to drive somewhere in traffic.</v>

1064
01:00:57.281 --> 01:01:02.281
<v Speaker 1>Why not make yourself a more formidable </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of you and enjoy a good book </v>

1065
01:01:03.011 --> 01:01:08.011
<v Speaker 1>while you're doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you got to keep your hands on the </v>

1066
01:01:08.011 --> 01:01:08.011
<v Speaker 1>wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to keep your eyes on the road.</v>

1067
01:01:08.011 --> 01:01:09.940
<v Speaker 1>So let's make it an audio book and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do that,</v>

1068
01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>let's get it from audible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The long running sponsors of this </v>

1069
01:01:15.341 --> 01:01:19.690
<v Speaker 1>program who helped make it possible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to educate yourself,</v>

1070
01:01:19.691 --> 01:01:22.750
<v Speaker 1>entertain yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and read while you do something else.</v>

1071
01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:26.410
<v Speaker 1>It would be hard to find anyone who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>made it easier,</v>

1072
01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:30.370
<v Speaker 1>figured out more angles and things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you would like as part of the process.</v>

1073
01:01:30.371 --> 01:01:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sign up for audible,</v>

1074
01:01:32.681 --> 01:01:35.620
<v Speaker 1>you get a free 30 day trial membership,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll get a free audio book.</v>

1075
01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:40.920
<v Speaker 1>You sign up for good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just keep coming and audibles </v>

1076
01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.490
<v Speaker 1>figured out a way to do this better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone else.</v>

1077
01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:44.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take for example,</v>

1078
01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:49.530
<v Speaker 1>they're whisper sync for voice aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing where you can switch </v>

1079
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:54.630
<v Speaker 1>back and forth between reading texts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to the audio book across a </v>

1080
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:57.610
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of devices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're reading on your kindle and</v>

1081
01:01:57.611 --> 01:02:02.611
<v Speaker 1>then you have to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go into your car and you'll </v>

1082
01:02:02.611 --> 01:02:02.611
<v Speaker 1>listen in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get out of your car,</v>

1083
01:02:02.611 --> 01:02:04.420
<v Speaker 1>your Amazon Echo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>place it right from where you left off.</v>

1084
01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:05.650
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1085
01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Don't miss a word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can share a book from your library </v>

1086
01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:16.170
<v Speaker 1>with anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's their first time accepting a </v>

1087
01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:18.481
<v Speaker 1>book and they can listen to it for free </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you own your books.</v>

1088
01:02:18.611 --> 01:02:19.350
<v Speaker 1>This is key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me.</v>

1089
01:02:19.351 --> 01:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to buy something and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>not own it.</v>

1090
01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:26.690
<v Speaker 1>With audible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You own the books that you purchase </v>

1091
01:02:26.690 --> 01:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>through them now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What books should you purchase?</v>

1092
01:02:26.881 --> 01:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

1093
01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>whatever you think is going to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more formidable you,</v>

1094
01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:36.170
<v Speaker 1>but for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am just addicted to reading the </v>

1095
01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:39.060
<v Speaker 1>accounts of participants in things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the extremes of the human experience.</v>

1096
01:02:39.061 --> 01:02:40.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take for example,</v>

1097
01:02:40.450 --> 01:02:43.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm Tony Mcphee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who we just had on the four star general</v>

1098
01:02:43.441 --> 01:02:48.441
<v Speaker 1>love that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at Vietnam is not your thing or </v>

1099
01:02:48.441 --> 01:02:48.441
<v Speaker 1>you're more of a land war person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1100
01:02:48.441 --> 01:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>how about war as I knew it by General </v>
<v Speaker 1>George Patton,</v>

1101
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:57.200
<v Speaker 1>probably the most famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguably the most famous second world </v>

1102
01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:57.200
<v Speaker 1>war US general.</v>

1103
01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:02.120
<v Speaker 1>This book is a little different because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is his remembrances and stuff out of </v>

1104
01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:06.381
<v Speaker 1>his diary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he died before the actual work that </v>

1105
01:03:06.381 --> 01:03:06.540
<v Speaker 1>he was going to put together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came out,</v>

1106
01:03:06.541 --> 01:03:09.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's about as close as you can get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The narrator even sounds a little patent</v>

1107
01:03:09.991 --> 01:03:10.680
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1108
01:03:10.681 --> 01:03:15.681
<v Speaker 1>if you want the definitive account that </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists from general George s dot </v>

1109
01:03:15.681 --> 01:03:17.520
<v Speaker 1>patents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>own written words,</v>

1110
01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:19.860
<v Speaker 1>go get wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that if you're a military history</v>

1111
01:03:19.861 --> 01:03:22.050
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be on your bookshelf anyway.</v>

1112
01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:24.840
<v Speaker 1>If you are a person who does a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving,</v>

1113
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:27.540
<v Speaker 1>who can listen to books while they work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1114
01:03:27.541 --> 01:03:32.541
<v Speaker 1>then maybe you need the audible version </v>
<v Speaker 1>to war as I knew it by General George </v>
