1
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.280
<v Speaker 1>It's hardcore history,</v>

2
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.870
<v Speaker 1>I've always said some of the best things</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do around here,</v>

3
00:00:10.871 --> 00:00:15.871
<v Speaker 1>our apologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I want to apologize if it seems </v>

4
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:18.850
<v Speaker 1>as though our subject matter and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the stuff we're talking about lately</v>

5
00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:23.851
<v Speaker 1>all kind of falls into a narrow sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>subject matter or a historical period.</v>

6
00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:27.880
<v Speaker 1>It's mostly been 20th century stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not by design,</v>

7
00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:32.881
<v Speaker 1>but I don't work by design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work on inspiration and sometimes </v>

8
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:37.081
<v Speaker 1>opportunity for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to get a guest like the </v>

9
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.961
<v Speaker 1>one we have today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So things don't always work out in a </v>

10
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:43.381
<v Speaker 1>balanced sort of way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'll probably happen is that we'll </v>

11
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:45.961
<v Speaker 1>end up flipping at a certain point and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll start getting emails from </v>

12
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:46.450
<v Speaker 1>people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you never talk about 20th century</v>

13
00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:51.451
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're just probably balancing things </v>

14
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:51.770
<v Speaker 1>out in the other direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk to her.</v>

15
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Max Hastings today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those of you who like military history,</v>

16
00:00:55.181 --> 00:00:56.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have certainly read his work.</v>

17
00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>He's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wrote inferno,</v>

18
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a lot of other books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at his resume as it exists </v>

19
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.411
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if you had shown that to me when I </v>

20
00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:07.540
<v Speaker 1>was 21 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have said,</v>

21
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.040
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the guy I want to be</v>

22
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.440
<v Speaker 1>his resumes long as heck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean foreign correspondent for the BBC</v>

23
00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>editor in Chief of the Daily Telegraph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>editor of the evening standard,</v>

24
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>a war correspondent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm author,</v>

25
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 1>prolific author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all around,</v>

26
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:31.851
<v Speaker 1>interesting person and he's written a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new book on Vietnam and 800 pages.</v>

27
00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:34.580
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

28
00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:37.040
<v Speaker 1>it's a tome at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:41.360
<v Speaker 1>if your library is like mine and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like having certain subjects covered,</v>

30
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a necessary thing on my Vietnam </v>

31
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.600
<v Speaker 1>section for any number of reasons.</v>

32
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Hastings has a connection to the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a war correspondent in it and it </v>

33
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.340
<v Speaker 1>was sort of where he made his bones as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>young guy.</v>

34
00:01:56.341 --> 00:02:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Go Google him and look at the images of </v>
<v Speaker 1>him when he was there.</v>

35
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:05.511
<v Speaker 1>And my wife thought he looked like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>beetle war correspondents are an </v>

36
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>interesting species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't make them like they used to,</v>

37
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:13.731
<v Speaker 1>I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time there are still </v>

38
00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 1>some good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sort of have a foot in both worlds.</v>

39
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:19.971
<v Speaker 1>The soldier world and the civilian world</v>
<v Speaker 1>here of people that maybe don't know war</v>

40
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:26.751
<v Speaker 1>at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so somehow you need to be able to </v>

41
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 1>translate things into a language where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

42
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reliably convey information so that they</v>

43
00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:35.841
<v Speaker 1>can understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to reliably transmit </v>

44
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:39.890
<v Speaker 1>information on what it's like to see a </v>
<v Speaker 1>disemboweled village chief who's had his</v>

45
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:45.681
<v Speaker 1>stomach cut out in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>villagers by the Viet Cong as a lesson </v>

46
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>not to cooperate with the Americans or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the South Vietnamese.</v>

47
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.590
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you even relate that in a way </v>

48
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 1>that people can understand and in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they just don't not read about it.</v>

49
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>At a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get graphic enough,</v>

50
00:02:57.331 --> 00:02:59.070
<v Speaker 1>people won't read about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you haven't done.</v>

51
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to do as a war </v>
<v Speaker 1>correspondent now.</v>

52
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only personal weakness.</v>

53
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>That probably kept me from doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

54
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>I started reading because I was enamored</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

55
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm all this stuff written and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>written about their own lives that these</v>

56
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:18.721
<v Speaker 1>war correspondents had put into print </v>
<v Speaker 1>and at a certain point you start to </v>

57
00:03:18.721 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 1>realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

58
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>do you really want to live with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>memories these guys have?</v>

59
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>And they're sort of warning you </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes when you read their books.</v>

60
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're telling you what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreaming about at night.</v>

61
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>You deliberately over and over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>again go to places where awful,</v>

62
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>awful things have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things soldiers see,</v>

63
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:40.111
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they don't often want to be </v>

64
00:03:40.111 --> 00:03:40.111
<v Speaker 1>there when it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war correspondent,</v>

65
00:03:40.111 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them that's like the story,</v>

66
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to the bad place.</v>

67
00:03:42.671 --> 00:03:47.671
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the soldiers are of the opinion </v>

68
00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:47.671
<v Speaker 1>that they don't want to go to the bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

69
00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:47.671
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be there.</v>

70
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.500
<v Speaker 1>So Max Hastings did this job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which always for me,</v>

71
00:03:51.501 --> 00:03:56.501
<v Speaker 1>makes an interesting read because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>filtering in real personal experiences,</v>

72
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.760
<v Speaker 1>tastes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smells,</v>

73
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 1>the lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture at the time that you just </v>

74
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.780
<v Speaker 1>can't get researching secondhand </v>
<v Speaker 1>sources.</v>

75
00:04:05.781 --> 00:04:10.781
<v Speaker 1>It would have been a very different book</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Dan Carlin had written it from other </v>

76
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:13.691
<v Speaker 1>people's stuff than to have a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was there who participated in the </v>

77
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:18.671
<v Speaker 1>activities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who interacted with all the people and </v>

78
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:21.701
<v Speaker 1>then has had decades and decades to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>how history played out since and to </v>

79
00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:24.680
<v Speaker 1>think about it and to sort of integrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>it into his overall worldview.</v>

80
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.880
<v Speaker 1>The result is this new book and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth picking up if you have interest or</v>

81
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.250
<v Speaker 1>you know a lot of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the Vietnam section on your </v>

82
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 1>shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you wanted to say what the focus of </v>

83
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.950
<v Speaker 1>the book is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's rightly put where it should</v>

84
00:04:36.951 --> 00:04:38.540
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it covers everything.</v>

85
00:04:38.541 --> 00:04:39.950
<v Speaker 1>That's the hardcore history books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

86
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the godlike view,</v>

87
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.030
<v Speaker 1>the hindsight view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leadership view,</v>

88
00:04:44.031 --> 00:04:45.710
<v Speaker 1>the mid level view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hamlet view,</v>

89
00:04:45.711 --> 00:04:50.711
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the what it's like to be the guy on the </v>

90
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:50.711
<v Speaker 1>ground view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why you get 800 pages or 26.</v>

91
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Our hardcore history series in the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>world war.</v>

92
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Either way it's like it's explainable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.250
<v Speaker 1>understandable.</v>

94
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.090
<v Speaker 1>The most interesting part to me since I </v>
<v Speaker 1>already know the battle stuff,</v>

95
00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:01.290
<v Speaker 1>although if you're into the battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

96
00:05:01.291 --> 00:05:02.970
<v Speaker 1>he's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Historically,</v>

97
00:05:02.971 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 1>he's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

98
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.720
<v Speaker 1>the most interesting thing for me though</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to see how he can synthesize all this</v>

99
00:05:09.721 --> 00:05:12.300
<v Speaker 1>stuff that's happened in the decades </v>
<v Speaker 1>since that era.</v>

100
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.520
<v Speaker 1>I was born in 1965,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1960.</v>

101
00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:19.521
<v Speaker 1>I was born by the way on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the one of the worst battles of the </v>

102
00:05:19.521 --> 00:05:19.521
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that made the movie about,</v>

103
00:05:19.521 --> 00:05:20.460
<v Speaker 1>that's my birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>November 14th,</v>

104
00:05:20.461 --> 00:05:23.030
<v Speaker 1>nine 65 battle of the I valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

105
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.360
<v Speaker 1>but when I was a kid just starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become aware,</v>

106
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the older brothers and those people who </v>

107
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.890
<v Speaker 1>were the ones being drafted who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>living through all this stuff.</v>

108
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.640
<v Speaker 1>So in the 19 seventies it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to explain.</v>

109
00:05:35.641 --> 00:05:37.470
<v Speaker 1>This was a transition period in US </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

110
00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:40.200
<v Speaker 1>So this is what I want this introduction</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Max Hastings,</v>

111
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Sir Max Hastings interview to be.</v>

112
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Let me sort of cover the bases again for</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who weren't there and try to set </v>

113
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.180
<v Speaker 1>up a little of this and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

114
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.410
<v Speaker 1>and let you know why it's important to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

115
00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:52.050
<v Speaker 1>And why it matters in history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>

116
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.260
<v Speaker 1>there is a before and after in us </v>
<v Speaker 1>history and we all know there are </v>

117
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.260
<v Speaker 1>several,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

118
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>You've got before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the civil war is a classic one for</v>

119
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 1>people to use before and after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam era,</v>

120
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.460
<v Speaker 1>go look at a photograph of Americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>will just choose a big city because </v>

121
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.200
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of continuity in some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the less big cities where people look </v>

122
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>the same over the decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

123
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:13.520
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are more conservative,</v>

124
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less slowly,</v>

125
00:06:14.361 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 1>less flashy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more down to earth people.</v>

126
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.310
<v Speaker 1>But you get some photos from an la,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>

127
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>

128
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.870
<v Speaker 1>some of the hip places supposedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you show a photo from 1963 and you </v>

129
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 1>compare those same people in a photo in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1973.</v>

130
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 1>And you don't even have to say another </v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

131
00:06:31.941 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the culture has totally changed.</v>

132
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 1>The Vietnam War is one of the major </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor points that account for this.</v>

133
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:40.420
<v Speaker 1>And there's several and they're much </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about it.</v>

134
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 1>A birth control pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sexual revolution,</v>

135
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>

136
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean just there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a number of major factors,</v>

137
00:06:46.401 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 1>but without the Vietnam war you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>not have any of those things.</v>

138
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.870
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the prime movers and as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend of mine who was at the protest </v>

139
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.981
<v Speaker 1>back in the day pointed out and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prime mover was the fact that many </v>

140
00:06:59.981 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 1>people might have to go and suffer in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>war that they really didn't want to be a</v>

141
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:07.091
<v Speaker 1>part of that tends to concentrate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind in a way that just some ideological</v>

142
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:12.581
<v Speaker 1>cause wouldn't that prime mover pushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward a lot of the era's change in the</v>

143
00:07:14.991 --> 00:07:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Zeit geist for lack of a better phrase.</v>

144
00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.580
<v Speaker 1>I know that's kind of strange change in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys,</v>

145
00:07:18.581 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the rape culture flipped now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>

146
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:26.390
<v Speaker 1>not in some places the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>heartland was remarkably consistent,</v>

147
00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.660
<v Speaker 1>but in many places and in terms of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Madison Avenue is feeding you and we're </v>

148
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood's feeding you and all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

149
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>the culture really changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam is an important point in that it</v>

150
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:38.090
<v Speaker 1>was also an era of extreme disillusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the government.</v>

151
00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:43.091
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to explain once again how </v>
<v Speaker 1>different Americans were before Vietnam </v>

152
00:07:43.091 --> 00:07:46.730
<v Speaker 1>and after if I just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we believed our government,</v>

153
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:52.450
<v Speaker 1>that right there is hard to square.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so far beyond what most people </v>

154
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:58.370
<v Speaker 1>today are raised with and it wasn't just</v>
<v Speaker 1>you believed the person in your party in</v>

155
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:03.371
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats and Republicans believed the </v>

156
00:08:03.371 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't matter who the president was,</v>

157
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.290
<v Speaker 1>you didn't think your government lied to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

158
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:11.291
<v Speaker 1>Now that's naive of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe if you look at us history as </v>

159
00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:15.830
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to a person growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're still in your dumb teens in</v>

160
00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:20.831
<v Speaker 1>that era as a country and learning some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these hard lessons like you know in </v>

161
00:08:20.831 --> 00:08:22.160
<v Speaker 1>power politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people lie.</v>

162
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.990
<v Speaker 1>The problem is though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you ended up with something </v>

163
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.331
<v Speaker 1>called a credibility gap where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president had lied so many times that </v>

164
00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:32.420
<v Speaker 1>the American people weren't buying it at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

165
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you had returned to some level </v>
<v Speaker 1>of perceived because it was always </v>

166
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.011
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some perceived normalcy with the next </v>

167
00:08:42.011 --> 00:08:43.370
<v Speaker 1>president of Americans could have had </v>
<v Speaker 1>their faith in the honesty of government</v>

168
00:08:43.371 --> 00:08:48.371
<v Speaker 1>restored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you had Richard Nixon after </v>

169
00:08:48.371 --> 00:08:48.371
<v Speaker 1>Lyndon Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

170
00:08:48.371 --> 00:08:51.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like being hit with a left and a </v>

171
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:51.520
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lyndon Johnson would probably,</v>

172
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hooky and an upper cut,</v>

173
00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:54.590
<v Speaker 1>you and Richard Nixon would hit you </v>
<v Speaker 1>below the belt,</v>

174
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

175
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:01.310
<v Speaker 1>But as a country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seventies was about sort of </v>

176
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 1>reevaluating a lot of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans had taken for granted in terms</v>

177
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:08.001
<v Speaker 1>of our self image and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to describe how lone ranger </v>

178
00:09:09.871 --> 00:09:12.270
<v Speaker 1>ish we felt at the time period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

179
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.330
<v Speaker 1>you know Philip Caputo in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

180
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:15.080
<v Speaker 1>well he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

181
00:09:15.081 --> 00:09:17.070
<v Speaker 1>he was the veteran who wrote rumor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

182
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:19.480
<v Speaker 1>but he's quoted in supermax hastings new</v>
<v Speaker 1>book too.</v>

183
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me read it to you.</v>

184
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:26.380
<v Speaker 1>He sort of describes the way Americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt about themselves.</v>

185
00:09:26.381 --> 00:09:31.381
<v Speaker 1>Or remember this is in the Post Second </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War era where the US is just in </v>

186
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:32.850
<v Speaker 1>our own minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saved Europe twice.</v>

187
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Then we rebuilt it with our own tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

188
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Then we protected it from the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union and Communism and the Cold War.</v>

189
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:39.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were.</v>

190
00:09:39.931 --> 00:09:44.931
<v Speaker 1>The good guys have history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hastings writes about Phil Kaputo quote,</v>

191
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Lieutenant Kaputo like General </v>
<v Speaker 1>Westmoreland saw himself fulfilling the </v>

192
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.930
<v Speaker 1>vision of John f Kennedy Kaputo then </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

193
00:09:53.931 --> 00:09:58.931
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he was the king of camelot than we </v>

194
00:09:58.931 --> 00:09:59.130
<v Speaker 1>were his knights and Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our crusade,</v>

195
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:04.340
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing we could not do </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we were Americans and for the </v>

196
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.400
<v Speaker 1>same reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever we did was right and quote,</v>

197
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.760
<v Speaker 1>their communist photos were quote the </v>
<v Speaker 1>new barbarians who menace the far flung </v>

198
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.650
<v Speaker 1>interests of the new Rome and to quote,</v>

199
00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:20.460
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard to describe how the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States saw itself as and the people,</v>

200
00:10:21.371 --> 00:10:26.371
<v Speaker 1>especially in the marketing materials as</v>
<v Speaker 1>this force of good around the world and </v>

201
00:10:26.891 --> 00:10:31.891
<v Speaker 1>with this dominance during the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>world war gave the United States a </v>

202
00:10:31.891 --> 00:10:35.800
<v Speaker 1>dominance that lasted for 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years in terms of of a headstart over</v>

203
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:40.801
<v Speaker 1>a broken world and the power that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gave you made you feel almost a </v>

204
00:10:41.501 --> 00:10:43.780
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to do something good with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

205
00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.500
<v Speaker 1>In his book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sir Max Hastings writes,</v>

206
00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:52.501
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was in the US and enormous self </v>

207
00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:56.731
<v Speaker 1>confidence and pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not unlike that of the Germans before </v>

208
00:10:56.731 --> 00:10:56.731
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>

209
00:10:56.731 --> 00:10:59.860
<v Speaker 1>a consciousness of national greatness </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking an outlet,</v>

210
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:05.190
<v Speaker 1>a searching for an appropriate challenge</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their powers and refusal to believe </v>

211
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:10.051
<v Speaker 1>that any problem was beyond their </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity to solve statesmen who might </v>

212
00:11:10.051 --> 00:11:14.371
<v Speaker 1>themselves have doubts were conscious of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great ground swell of public opinion </v>

213
00:11:14.371 --> 00:11:16.690
<v Speaker 1>bearing them on and quote.</v>

214
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.560
<v Speaker 1>This was the era where John F Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>was saying,</v>

215
00:11:20.561 --> 00:11:25.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will bear any burden for the success </v>

216
00:11:25.561 --> 00:11:29.341
<v Speaker 1>of liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sacrificing that the country was </v>

217
00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:32.011
<v Speaker 1>willing to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the era where young people were </v>

218
00:11:32.011 --> 00:11:34.801
<v Speaker 1>motivated by a sense of idealism that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some cases lead people to go to other </v>

219
00:11:34.801 --> 00:11:35.390
<v Speaker 1>countries and build,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

220
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:40.550
<v Speaker 1>farms and chicken coops and his work in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Peace Corps to others who saw a </v>

221
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:45.511
<v Speaker 1>similar sort of mission to help people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially poor people in undeveloped </v>

222
00:11:46.061 --> 00:11:51.061
<v Speaker 1>countries who needed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By giving them a government that was </v>

223
00:11:51.061 --> 00:11:54.211
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see this idealism amongst all of </v>

224
00:11:54.211 --> 00:11:56.170
<v Speaker 1>these people across a wide spectrum of </v>
<v Speaker 1>types.</v>

225
00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as background in the war,</v>

226
00:11:59.521 --> 00:12:04.521
<v Speaker 1>so we have some context here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go into this with a Somax Max </v>

227
00:12:04.521 --> 00:12:05.160
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not deal with the stuff we can all</v>

228
00:12:05.161 --> 00:12:07.620
<v Speaker 1>find out beforehand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Vietnam war,</v>

229
00:12:07.621 --> 00:12:12.621
<v Speaker 1>as many of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is something that grows out of </v>

230
00:12:12.621 --> 00:12:16.130
<v Speaker 1>colonialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of those territories that a </v>

231
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:16.950
<v Speaker 1>colonial power from Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>

232
00:12:16.951 --> 00:12:18.630
<v Speaker 1>the French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a controlled.</v>

233
00:12:18.631 --> 00:12:23.631
<v Speaker 1>It was French Indochina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They treated it the way that colonial </v>

234
00:12:23.631 --> 00:12:26.690
<v Speaker 1>powers usually treat these places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puppets,</v>

235
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.690
<v Speaker 1>they were bringing civilization was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

236
00:12:29.691 --> 00:12:34.691
<v Speaker 1>but truthfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was a bunch of French people </v>

237
00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:35.120
<v Speaker 1>in Nice hotels with Vietnamese waiters </v>
<v Speaker 1>and whatnot.</v>

238
00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.560
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that there weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that liked it in Vietnam,</v>

239
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.290
<v Speaker 1>but when the Second World War was over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

240
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:47.480
<v Speaker 1>the anti colonialism wave was unleashed </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the world.</v>

241
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam fell into a pattern of a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other places that we're trying to throw </v>

242
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.360
<v Speaker 1>off the yoke of their colonial masters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the case of Vietnam,</v>

243
00:12:56.361 --> 00:13:01.361
<v Speaker 1>there was a war before the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of the Vietnam War for a long </v>

244
00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:02.570
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A very bloody nasty,</v>

245
00:13:02.571 --> 00:13:06.260
<v Speaker 1>dirty war between the French and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>were called the Viet Minh.</v>

246
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.480
<v Speaker 1>It was sometime during this period where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas of fighting for Vietnam </v>

247
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:14.300
<v Speaker 1>nationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

248
00:13:14.301 --> 00:13:14.840
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

249
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.650
<v Speaker 1>the nation state a free Vietnam for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnamese run by Vietnamese.</v>

250
00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point there are communists who </v>

251
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.360
<v Speaker 1>become part of that movement are always </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of it.</v>

252
00:13:26.361 --> 00:13:29.030
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this connection between </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

253
00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:33.350
<v Speaker 1>these militant nationalist Vietnamese </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements and communism.</v>

254
00:13:33.351 --> 00:13:38.351
<v Speaker 1>And this will be a poison pill for </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries like the United States </v>

255
00:13:38.511 --> 00:13:39.770
<v Speaker 1>throughout the later</v>

256
00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.960
<v Speaker 1>part of this conflict because when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnamese eventually,</v>

257
00:13:44.961 --> 00:13:49.961
<v Speaker 1>after some nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty battles are able to win their </v>

258
00:13:49.961 --> 00:13:53.951
<v Speaker 1>independence from the French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States has already gotten </v>

259
00:13:53.951 --> 00:13:57.551
<v Speaker 1>their toe in the water in that region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not because they really want the French </v>

260
00:13:57.551 --> 00:14:01.301
<v Speaker 1>to be the colonial masters anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because of that worry over </v>

261
00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:04.841
<v Speaker 1>communism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing that's hard to </v>

262
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:07.511
<v Speaker 1>describe to people today is the role </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the fear of communism played in all</v>

263
00:14:08.721 --> 00:14:10.730
<v Speaker 1>the decision making and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>calculations.</v>

264
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam was just one of the many </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that was supposedly part of </v>

265
00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.050
<v Speaker 1>the domino effect where you might say to</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

266
00:14:18.051 --> 00:14:20.150
<v Speaker 1>as many Americans did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know what Vietnam was.</v>

267
00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:22.130
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't pronounce it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't find it on a map,</v>

268
00:14:22.131 --> 00:14:26.120
<v Speaker 1>so why do we have to send our boys on </v>
<v Speaker 1>our money to go fight and die there?</v>

269
00:14:26.121 --> 00:14:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what happens,</v>

270
00:14:27.591 --> 00:14:29.720
<v Speaker 1>and remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't Malarkey.</v>

271
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.060
<v Speaker 1>The people who are spouting it generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it,</v>

272
00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:37.450
<v Speaker 1>but this is just another country that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be toppled by the communists and </v>

273
00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:41.771
<v Speaker 1>then that country will be consolidated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and start to try to topple the person </v>

274
00:14:41.771 --> 00:14:43.490
<v Speaker 1>next door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The French had a different analogy.</v>

275
00:14:43.491 --> 00:14:44.780
<v Speaker 1>They didn't use dominoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They they,</v>

276
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.740
<v Speaker 1>they use bowling pins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea and the image is the same,</v>

277
00:14:48.741 --> 00:14:49.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's A.</v>

278
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a toppling from one another to </v>
<v Speaker 1>another and eventually you'll have the </v>

279
00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Mexico there were a lot of problems.</v>

280
00:14:57.591 --> 00:15:00.050
<v Speaker 1>It turns out in hastings is book as good</v>
<v Speaker 1>at pointing this out.</v>

281
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:05.290
<v Speaker 1>There were a lot of problems in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision makers understanding of all </v>

282
00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:09.671
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in hindsight seems crazy because </v>

283
00:15:09.671 --> 00:15:11.891
<v Speaker 1>when you look at how many people would </v>
<v Speaker 1>die and all these wars and how many </v>

284
00:15:11.891 --> 00:15:14.681
<v Speaker 1>would be killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hastings book focuses on the civilians </v>

285
00:15:14.681 --> 00:15:14.840
<v Speaker 1>more than anything and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rightly so,</v>

286
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:16.010
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

287
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:21.340
<v Speaker 1>but when you see all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you yearn for a reason and you yearn for</v>

288
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:28.690
<v Speaker 1>just wanting to believe that the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are making the decisions are at </v>

289
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.650
<v Speaker 1>least well informed that they've gotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>the experts,</v>

290
00:15:30.651 --> 00:15:32.390
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got people explaining to them,</v>

291
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:37.391
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me explain the difference between </v>

292
00:15:37.391 --> 00:15:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Soviet communism in Chinese communism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the relationship of,</v>

293
00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.520
<v Speaker 1>of Vietnam to either of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

294
00:15:40.521 --> 00:15:45.521
<v Speaker 1>that was already in some cases below </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the threshold where anybody was </v>

295
00:15:45.521 --> 00:15:49.670
<v Speaker 1>paying attention and for much of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict and for others during this time</v>

296
00:15:49.671 --> 00:15:53.390
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this belief that Moscow controls</v>

297
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.240
<v Speaker 1>everything in the communist world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just wasn't true.</v>

298
00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:00.260
<v Speaker 1>But if that's something you're basing </v>
<v Speaker 1>all your decision making on,</v>

299
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.080
<v Speaker 1>well it's no wonder that things worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>out the way they did.</v>

300
00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

301
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:09.490
<v Speaker 1>there were occasions where our </v>
<v Speaker 1>government just thought the other side </v>

302
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:14.471
<v Speaker 1>was being stubborn when in reality we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking to the people who had no </v>

303
00:16:14.471 --> 00:16:16.880
<v Speaker 1>control over the events we wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence and we didn't even know it.</v>

304
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.320
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to believe you could have such</v>
<v Speaker 1>momentous decisions regularly made with </v>

305
00:16:23.631 --> 00:16:27.350
<v Speaker 1>such either bad intelligence or lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>

306
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.800
<v Speaker 1>but let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the things that waiting a</v>

307
00:16:30.801 --> 00:16:35.801
<v Speaker 1>couple of decades or in this case five </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades after the events so that makes </v>

308
00:16:36.021 --> 00:16:37.730
<v Speaker 1>clear you have a chance and another </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

309
00:16:37.731 --> 00:16:42.731
<v Speaker 1>hastings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because very good at you have a chance </v>

310
00:16:42.731 --> 00:16:42.731
<v Speaker 1>to get the other side's point of view to</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview those people.</v>

311
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm considering that we're starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lose that generation.</v>

312
00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Just like the Second World War </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation hastings is booked,</v>

313
00:16:49.061 --> 00:16:54.061
<v Speaker 1>might turn out to be one of those really</v>
<v Speaker 1>important things on a shelf for a very </v>

314
00:16:54.061 --> 00:16:57.461
<v Speaker 1>long time because you can't replicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>those discussions he had with the </v>

315
00:16:57.461 --> 00:16:58.580
<v Speaker 1>principals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

316
00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:01.490
<v Speaker 1>if you remember this period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you remember that part of the problem,</v>

317
00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:07.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of our good guy image to </v>

318
00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:09.131
<v Speaker 1>ourselves was some of the news that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out of this place and what ended </v>

319
00:17:09.131 --> 00:17:13.541
<v Speaker 1>up happening in a nutshell is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you see happen in a lot of other </v>

320
00:17:13.541 --> 00:17:16.931
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw it with the French in their war </v>

321
00:17:16.931 --> 00:17:16.931
<v Speaker 1>in North Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

322
00:17:16.931 --> 00:17:20.281
<v Speaker 1>In places like Algeria in the 19 fifties</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it becomes a dirty war when you </v>

323
00:17:20.281 --> 00:17:25.151
<v Speaker 1>have civilians carrying bombs and kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing grenades into restaurants and </v>

324
00:17:25.151 --> 00:17:25.370
<v Speaker 1>people hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

325
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:31.090
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult after a while to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>your troops from doing the sorts of </v>

326
00:17:31.761 --> 00:17:34.970
<v Speaker 1>things that the folks back home imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>that their troops don't do.</v>

327
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.110
<v Speaker 1>In the case of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things happen in the Vietnam War.</v>

328
00:17:39.111 --> 00:17:42.320
<v Speaker 1>That if you had gone back a mere 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>

329
00:17:42.321 --> 00:17:47.321
<v Speaker 1>17 years before and asked the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>public whether anything like this was </v>

330
00:17:47.321 --> 00:17:51.370
<v Speaker 1>ever possible from American soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have denied to high heaven </v>

331
00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:52.590
<v Speaker 1>the Mee Lai massacre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

332
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.250
<v Speaker 1>But there was regular bad stuff going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

333
00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:01.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to proclaim something </v>

334
00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.880
<v Speaker 1>like a free fire zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course in Vietnam was famous,</v>

335
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:08.180
<v Speaker 1>which means that anyone you see in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>area is considered a bad person by </v>

336
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:09.870
<v Speaker 1>default.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

337
00:18:09.871 --> 00:18:14.670
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be a good tally at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the year when you start trying to</v>

338
00:18:14.671 --> 00:18:19.671
<v Speaker 1>figure out how many actual enemy you </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed versus how many people who just </v>

339
00:18:19.671 --> 00:18:23.811
<v Speaker 1>got in the way wrong place at the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and that became another problem </v>

340
00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:25.370
<v Speaker 1>with the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The war had very many.</v>

341
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.220
<v Speaker 1>There were constraints on the war and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the constraints are things that we still</v>

342
00:18:29.221 --> 00:18:34.221
<v Speaker 1>talk about today because it was the cold</v>
<v Speaker 1>war and because people had nuclear </v>

343
00:18:34.221 --> 00:18:38.421
<v Speaker 1>weapons and because the Soviet Union and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese were on the other side and </v>

344
00:18:38.421 --> 00:18:41.100
<v Speaker 1>because we had just fought a sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>undeclared will,</v>

345
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.910
<v Speaker 1>really undeclared war that started </v>
<v Speaker 1>against Korea,</v>

346
00:18:44.911 --> 00:18:48.450
<v Speaker 1>but ended up being American troops and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese troops killing each other.</v>

347
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.050
<v Speaker 1>The last thing that anybody wanted was </v>
<v Speaker 1>another one of those,</v>

348
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:57.470
<v Speaker 1>so there was always an attempt to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>the war confined to certain parameters.</v>

349
00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you've got this fire burning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just want to make sure that the fire</v>

350
00:19:04.081 --> 00:19:07.710
<v Speaker 1>doesn't spread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at all times any conflict,</v>

351
00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:12.711
<v Speaker 1>especially one going on as long as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam war did is a potential flash </v>

352
00:19:12.711 --> 00:19:15.210
<v Speaker 1>point in world war three and let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember as bad as Vietnam was,</v>

353
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:20.780
<v Speaker 1>imagine how bad something like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have been if it became the </v>

354
00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:21.420
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

355
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Gavrilo Princip shooting an archduke in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarajevo in 1914.</v>

356
00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:32.150
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't be talking about two or 3 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million Vietnamese civilians dying in </v>

357
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:34.740
<v Speaker 1>this war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would be talking about 100,</v>

358
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:38.820
<v Speaker 1>200 million people and us still clearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the ashes today.</v>

359
00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:40.950
<v Speaker 1>So let's try to remember the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

360
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:46.040
<v Speaker 1>the big picture that the leaders in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>story are trying to juggle it all times.</v>

361
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:51.980
<v Speaker 1>So you have lack of good information </v>
<v Speaker 1>with nuclear weapons as your punishment </v>

362
00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:52.440
<v Speaker 1>if you screw up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No pressure there.</v>

363
00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

364
00:19:55.380 --> 00:20:00.380
<v Speaker 1>But the 19 seventies were about coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>to some sort of emotional terms with </v>

365
00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:01.380
<v Speaker 1>this and then there's those of us who </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived through it,</v>

366
00:20:01.381 --> 00:20:06.381
<v Speaker 1>it's almost not worth talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we remember it so well and it </v>

367
00:20:06.381 --> 00:20:06.381
<v Speaker 1>was so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

368
00:20:06.381 --> 00:20:07.770
<v Speaker 1>it was beaten to death by the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's be honest,</v>

369
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.430
<v Speaker 1>but new generations coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't remember any of this.</v>

370
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:16.760
<v Speaker 1>It was a very different postwar world </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the veterans who came back from </v>

371
00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.420
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam because this was a war we lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Americans.</v>

372
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:23.600
<v Speaker 1>I can again say from experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to be very proud of the fact </v>

373
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.901
<v Speaker 1>that you could say we never lost a war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Canadians do not need to write me </v>

374
00:20:26.901 --> 00:20:27.000
<v Speaker 1>about the war of 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12.</v>

375
00:20:27.001 --> 00:20:32.001
<v Speaker 1>I realized that that's a eye of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beholder issue a little bit and I don't </v>

376
00:20:32.001 --> 00:20:32.001
<v Speaker 1>want to get into a couple of others with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

377
00:20:32.001 --> 00:20:32.760
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

378
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Theoretically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of sort of,</v>

379
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:35.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our own minds,</v>

380
00:20:35.551 --> 00:20:37.890
<v Speaker 1>we never lost a war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam was hard to deny.</v>

381
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam also broke the army for a while </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a a point that's well </v>

382
00:20:45.061 --> 00:20:50.061
<v Speaker 1>understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you read about this kind of stuff </v>

383
00:20:50.061 --> 00:20:50.920
<v Speaker 1>that's not talked about a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it did to the US army between let's</v>

384
00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:55.921
<v Speaker 1>just say 65 and 70 was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

385
00:20:56.261 --> 00:20:58.960
<v Speaker 1>something you wouldn't have thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>could happen to an American army,</v>

386
00:20:58.961 --> 00:21:01.780
<v Speaker 1>but then it hadn't been put in that kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of situation before.</v>

387
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.310
<v Speaker 1>As we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the French.</v>

388
00:21:03.311 --> 00:21:08.311
<v Speaker 1>In Algeria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find yourselves in these kinds of </v>

389
00:21:08.311 --> 00:21:09.010
<v Speaker 1>situations and all of a sudden it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit different.</v>

390
00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:13.180
<v Speaker 1>You had drug abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you add the short tour of duty.</v>

391
00:21:13.181 --> 00:21:18.181
<v Speaker 1>There were a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The army really looked at a lot of </v>

392
00:21:18.181 --> 00:21:20.641
<v Speaker 1>things after the war to try to figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what had happened and if you're </v>

393
00:21:20.641 --> 00:21:20.641
<v Speaker 1>interested in that subject.</v>

394
00:21:20.641 --> 00:21:24.060
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andrew j Bacevich has written several </v>

395
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.911
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm describing the rebuilding of the US </v>

396
00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:32.040
<v Speaker 1>military after Vietnam and what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>required and the safeguards that the </v>

397
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:36.691
<v Speaker 1>military brass tried to put into place </v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep the civilians from ever putting </v>

398
00:21:36.691 --> 00:21:36.850
<v Speaker 1>them in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That situation again,</v>

399
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.240
<v Speaker 1>didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there were safeguards put into A.</v>

400
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Colin Powell is written about this too </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was involved in some of this </v>

401
00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.941
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people don't talk about that very </v>

402
00:21:47.941 --> 00:21:47.941
<v Speaker 1>much for the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

403
00:21:47.941 --> 00:21:51.890
<v Speaker 1>you could look at the American army in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1973 who and that's from the Vietnam War</v>

404
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.210
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:21:55.211 --> 00:21:57.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the morale and whatnot.</v>

406
00:21:57.551 --> 00:21:58.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was um,</v>

407
00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:04.410
<v Speaker 1>a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean fragging was something that was </v>

408
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:04.410
<v Speaker 1>talked about a lot and you know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>fragging is,</v>

409
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:08.161
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shooting of your own officers or </v>

410
00:22:08.161 --> 00:22:08.161
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

411
00:22:08.161 --> 00:22:08.161
<v Speaker 1>you throw a grenade at them when no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one's looking.</v>

412
00:22:08.161 --> 00:22:12.690
<v Speaker 1>We were fragging our officers sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't find a lot of that from the </v>

413
00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Second World War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the Second World War we had a </v>

414
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.300
<v Speaker 1>very different kind of us image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about the images,</v>

415
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:22.060
<v Speaker 1>you kind of live up to that where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to write.</v>

416
00:22:22.061 --> 00:22:23.650
<v Speaker 1>So you just stayed away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans don't do this.</v>

417
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.530
<v Speaker 1>It became hard to say Americans don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

418
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:27.940
<v Speaker 1>After Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

419
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.850
<v Speaker 1>it was the war that proved that we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>human,</v>

420
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:32.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>

421
00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.810
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were as good guys as we tried to be,</v>

422
00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:39.811
<v Speaker 1>but we were human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who goes back and dives deep </v>

423
00:22:39.811 --> 00:22:41.680
<v Speaker 1>into things like the Filipino </v>
<v Speaker 1>insurrection or,</v>

424
00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:43.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the native American war,</v>

425
00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.070
<v Speaker 1>certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

426
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.150
<v Speaker 1>we've proven this point before in us </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

427
00:22:46.151 --> 00:22:51.151
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of need to relearn it every </v>

428
00:22:51.151 --> 00:22:51.151
<v Speaker 1>generation or two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems</v>

429
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.650
<v Speaker 1>one of the other things hastings focuses</v>
<v Speaker 1>on and I think it's,</v>

430
00:22:58.651 --> 00:23:03.030
<v Speaker 1>it's an excellent point is how bad the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other side was there.</v>

431
00:23:03.031 --> 00:23:04.230
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he said,</v>

432
00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.930
<v Speaker 1>a little self flagellation on the part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Americans.</v>

433
00:23:06.931 --> 00:23:09.150
<v Speaker 1>But he was a hard thing for us to </v>
<v Speaker 1>absorb.</v>

434
00:23:09.151 --> 00:23:11.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a huge deal.</v>

435
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:12.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country was,</v>

436
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:17.510
<v Speaker 1>was wrestling with huge issues in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies to early 19 eighties about </v>

437
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.510
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

438
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:18.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in,</v>

439
00:23:18.511 --> 00:23:23.511
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the early courses and 60 minutes </v>

440
00:23:23.511 --> 00:23:25.731
<v Speaker 1>did a whole big thing on this because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was groundbreaking at the time that </v>

441
00:23:25.731 --> 00:23:29.180
<v Speaker 1>undergraduates were taking it at </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities where the Vietnam War was </v>

442
00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.380
<v Speaker 1>on the curriculum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that they would do</v>

443
00:23:31.381 --> 00:23:33.500
<v Speaker 1>is bring in these veterans to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

444
00:23:33.501 --> 00:23:34.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in every class.</v>

445
00:23:34.351 --> 00:23:38.100
<v Speaker 1>So I took one of the University of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado and we had a veteran who sat in</v>

446
00:23:38.101 --> 00:23:40.470
<v Speaker 1>the back of the class and we didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a veteran because these guys were</v>

447
00:23:40.471 --> 00:23:45.471
<v Speaker 1>like 32 or 33 years old when they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to her class and sat in the </v>

448
00:23:45.471 --> 00:23:49.881
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the classroom the whole time and then </v>

449
00:23:49.881 --> 00:23:49.881
<v Speaker 1>like after eight weeks or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stood up and said,</v>

450
00:23:49.881 --> 00:23:50.630
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching this whole class as </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of my recovery.</v>

451
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to come to grips with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

452
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.610
<v Speaker 1>We actually showed a movie in the class </v>
<v Speaker 1>that showed a helicopter door gunner and</v>

453
00:23:55.611 --> 00:23:57.200
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie showed me.</v>

454
00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:59.300
<v Speaker 1>I was the helicopter door gunner you saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that film,</v>

455
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.830
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we,</v>

456
00:24:01.831 --> 00:24:05.720
<v Speaker 1>we're all wrestling with things back </v>
<v Speaker 1>back then and it's hard to describe to a</v>

457
00:24:05.721 --> 00:24:10.721
<v Speaker 1>generation now who grows up in an era </v>
<v Speaker 1>where no one ever believes their </v>

458
00:24:10.721 --> 00:24:13.481
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just the right way to be by </v>

459
00:24:13.481 --> 00:24:15.281
<v Speaker 1>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the United States is fully seen as </v>

460
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.420
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically a good guy,</v>

461
00:24:17.421 --> 00:24:19.550
<v Speaker 1>but fully fallible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fallible.</v>

462
00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Part was not something that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought of say in the early 19 sixties.</v>

463
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:28.750
<v Speaker 1>We were a force for good only in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>minds and so it was this huge mental </v>

464
00:24:31.341 --> 00:24:34.310
<v Speaker 1>rearrangement in the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the material,</v>

465
00:24:34.311 --> 00:24:39.311
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was a lot of introspection </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't just introspection amongst</v>

466
00:24:39.921 --> 00:24:44.921
<v Speaker 1>the general population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the military also and the political </v>

467
00:24:44.921 --> 00:24:46.880
<v Speaker 1>class when we eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

468
00:24:46.881 --> 00:24:49.640
<v Speaker 1>was it Panama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 1989 or something.</v>

469
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.190
<v Speaker 1>When that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think President Bush,</v>

470
00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:53.480
<v Speaker 1>the first had said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

471
00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:56.030
<v Speaker 1>we finally kicked the Vietnam Syndrome </v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatnot,</v>

472
00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:01.150
<v Speaker 1>and the Vietnam Syndrome was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the after effect where all of a sudden </v>

473
00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:05.320
<v Speaker 1>the United States didn't want to go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>mess with other countries for awhile.</v>

474
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.340
<v Speaker 1>We'd had enough of that for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just,</v>

475
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:08.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

476
00:25:08.751 --> 00:25:10.660
<v Speaker 1>the soldiers who had died and were </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to do,</v>

477
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:15.700
<v Speaker 1>or the veterans who were increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing signs of being a badly effected </v>

478
00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:19.751
<v Speaker 1>by what happened to them in the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the cost and the blow back and there</v>

479
00:25:19.881 --> 00:25:22.070
<v Speaker 1>was just this feeling for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no more.</v>

480
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:27.730
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time passes and people change and you </v>

481
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:29.720
<v Speaker 1>forget just how bad it can be when </v>
<v Speaker 1>things go wrong.</v>

482
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:32.630
<v Speaker 1>And make no mistake about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things went wrong in Vietnam.</v>

483
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:38.800
<v Speaker 1>The idea that the United States of </v>
<v Speaker 1>America after the Second World War were </v>

484
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.680
<v Speaker 1>still at this pinnacle of of industrial </v>
<v Speaker 1>might and military power.</v>

485
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:48.010
<v Speaker 1>The idea that a bunch of backward </v>
<v Speaker 1>gorillas in what we called a third world</v>

486
00:25:49.491 --> 00:25:52.850
<v Speaker 1>country with no money and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've got no.</v>

487
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:58.140
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing that they could beat us </v>

488
00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.530
<v Speaker 1>that right there was a hard pill to </v>
<v Speaker 1>swallow,</v>

489
00:26:00.531 --> 00:26:03.380
<v Speaker 1>but it reminded military and political </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders once again,</v>

490
00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:08.770
<v Speaker 1>that war is not disconnected from </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics as Clausewitz so famously said,</v>

491
00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:14.410
<v Speaker 1>and what you're really after in any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these situations is a political </v>

492
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:18.041
<v Speaker 1>settlement or a political change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your enemy or your adversary or your </v>

493
00:26:18.651 --> 00:26:23.651
<v Speaker 1>opponent does not give in when you beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell out of them and give you what </v>

494
00:26:23.651 --> 00:26:24.260
<v Speaker 1>you want politically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

495
00:26:24.261 --> 00:26:29.090
<v Speaker 1>When the United States did not lose a </v>
<v Speaker 1>major encounter in the Vietnam war,</v>

496
00:26:29.091 --> 00:26:34.091
<v Speaker 1>and the bigger the encounter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more likely the United States one </v>

497
00:26:34.091 --> 00:26:34.460
<v Speaker 1>and one big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most famous.</v>

498
00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Most Americans that know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this war.</v>

499
00:26:38.091 --> 00:26:43.091
<v Speaker 1>I have heard the words Tet offensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>before it was a famous Vietnamese </v>

500
00:26:43.091 --> 00:26:46.650
<v Speaker 1>northern Vietnamese attack in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>places at once.</v>

501
00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.420
<v Speaker 1>That was a disaster for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was not portrayed that way at the</v>

502
00:26:51.421 --> 00:26:56.421
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember one veteran explaining to me </v>

503
00:26:56.421 --> 00:26:58.131
<v Speaker 1>just how unbelievable the casualties </v>
<v Speaker 1>were that the north Vietnamese and Viet </v>

504
00:26:58.131 --> 00:27:02.900
<v Speaker 1>Cong suffered in that offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't about body counts.</v>

505
00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:06.460
<v Speaker 1>They weren't fighting a war for body </v>
<v Speaker 1>counts.</v>

506
00:27:06.461 --> 00:27:10.870
<v Speaker 1>They were fighting a war for a political</v>
<v Speaker 1>settlement and because the United States</v>

507
00:27:10.871 --> 00:27:14.590
<v Speaker 1>had lied to it's people so often about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how the war was going,</v>

508
00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:20.070
<v Speaker 1>what the other side did by sacrificing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ton of their people and material was </v>

509
00:27:20.531 --> 00:27:21.190
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

510
00:27:21.191 --> 00:27:23.470
<v Speaker 1>war's not over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time,</v>

511
00:27:23.471 --> 00:27:27.160
<v Speaker 1>basically demonstrate to everyone that </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they'd been told was false,</v>

512
00:27:27.161 --> 00:27:29.950
<v Speaker 1>which turned the people once more </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the political regime.</v>

513
00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.020
<v Speaker 1>If you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

514
00:27:32.021 --> 00:27:34.000
<v Speaker 1>if you think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to do this because it's,</v>

515
00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:34.930
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

516
00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:36.700
<v Speaker 1>there's no respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

517
00:27:36.701 --> 00:27:37.660
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems wrong.</v>

518
00:27:37.661 --> 00:27:42.661
<v Speaker 1>But if you think about it like a game </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're playing one side or the </v>

519
00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:46.861
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating to see how if you get </v>

520
00:27:46.861 --> 00:27:47.530
<v Speaker 1>to be the north Vietnamese communists </v>
<v Speaker 1>side in this,</v>

521
00:27:47.531 --> 00:27:52.531
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how little you have to play with in </v>

522
00:27:52.531 --> 00:27:53.860
<v Speaker 1>terms of real pieces that have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

523
00:27:53.861 --> 00:27:58.510
<v Speaker 1>the other side's got all the good pieces</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet there's ways to win without them</v>

524
00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:01.570
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy when I was growing up as guys in</v>

525
00:28:01.571 --> 00:28:06.400
<v Speaker 1>black pajamas beat the US military </v>
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensible,</v>

526
00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:12.920
<v Speaker 1>but an entire generation of military </v>
<v Speaker 1>personnel who were mostly junior </v>

527
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:17.481
<v Speaker 1>officers in that war would grow up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence the way the US military </v>

528
00:28:17.481 --> 00:28:18.810
<v Speaker 1>developed 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

529
00:28:18.811 --> 00:28:23.811
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 years and now all the way to now in </v>

530
00:28:23.811 --> 00:28:26.040
<v Speaker 1>the footprints of Vietnam are all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>this military.</v>

531
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:31.510
<v Speaker 1>It's back mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while it would be sort of outside </v>

532
00:28:32.671 --> 00:28:35.820
<v Speaker 1>the norms of human history to expect us </v>
<v Speaker 1>not to make the same mistakes,</v>

533
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:38.400
<v Speaker 1>they certainly changed a bunch of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

534
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this war will never be lost in America's</v>

535
00:28:42.211 --> 00:28:43.290
<v Speaker 1>living rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>

536
00:28:43.291 --> 00:28:46.470
<v Speaker 1>As the old saying was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's astounding and I'll wrap it up.</v>

537
00:28:46.471 --> 00:28:47.820
<v Speaker 1>So to hear when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you listen to,</v>

538
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:52.870
<v Speaker 1>or Max Hastings as a war correspondent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of freedom that they had to </v>

539
00:28:53.041 --> 00:28:58.041
<v Speaker 1>cover that war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a weird situation because if </v>

540
00:28:58.041 --> 00:28:58.800
<v Speaker 1>you look at press coverage in the second</v>
<v Speaker 1>world war and Korea,</v>

541
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:04.160
<v Speaker 1>it's highly regulated and censored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the next big war after Korea,</v>

542
00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Korea ends in what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty one,</v>

543
00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:08.850
<v Speaker 1>52.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next big war starts ramping up 63,</v>

544
00:29:08.851 --> 00:29:12.720
<v Speaker 1>64 in Vietnam with a lot of advisors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean who has 16,500</v>

545
00:29:12.721 --> 00:29:15.240
<v Speaker 1>at one point before the real troops came</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

546
00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

547
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:22.510
<v Speaker 1>the media all of a sudden doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>those constraints for really the first </v>

548
00:29:22.611 --> 00:29:24.500
<v Speaker 1>time in modern American history </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly.</v>

549
00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:29.150
<v Speaker 1>And they seem to get less and less </v>
<v Speaker 1>constrained as the war goes on.</v>

550
00:29:29.151 --> 00:29:34.151
<v Speaker 1>And when you see some of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one famous firefight where the </v>

551
00:29:34.151 --> 00:29:35.060
<v Speaker 1>reporter is what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's during tet,</v>

552
00:29:35.061 --> 00:29:37.730
<v Speaker 1>where the reporter walks up to US troops</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

553
00:29:37.731 --> 00:29:42.731
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a wall I think may be marines that </v>

554
00:29:42.731 --> 00:29:44.080
<v Speaker 1>are a wall and they are fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>something right on the other side of the</v>

555
00:29:44.081 --> 00:29:47.260
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they are reloading their weapons and</v>

556
00:29:47.261 --> 00:29:52.261
<v Speaker 1>then standing up and shooting at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other side of the wall and the reporter </v>

557
00:29:52.261 --> 00:29:52.690
<v Speaker 1>walks right up and starts interviewing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy is,</v>

558
00:29:52.691 --> 00:29:54.790
<v Speaker 1>he's reloading is gun during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>firefight.</v>

559
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Now two things stand out at you right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

560
00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Number one is that's a ballsy reporter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

561
00:29:59.291 --> 00:30:02.020
<v Speaker 1>That's a war correspondent of the sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are just,</v>

562
00:30:02.021 --> 00:30:02.950
<v Speaker 1>they're amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

563
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I've always had an admiration for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>willingness to go get the story when </v>

564
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:12.241
<v Speaker 1>they go get the story like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean Ernie pyle was killed by a </v>

565
00:30:12.241 --> 00:30:12.241
<v Speaker 1>sniper machine gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think actually,</v>

566
00:30:12.241 --> 00:30:12.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

567
00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:16.810
<v Speaker 1>covering the Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing you realize is that,</v>

568
00:30:16.811 --> 00:30:21.811
<v Speaker 1>that is absolutely uncensored work </v>
<v Speaker 1>content coming right back to America's </v>

569
00:30:21.811 --> 00:30:24.880
<v Speaker 1>living rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I recall going from memory here,</v>

570
00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.070
<v Speaker 1>when the reporter asked the soldier </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like,</v>

571
00:30:27.071 --> 00:30:28.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did he want to reach?</v>

572
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.560
<v Speaker 1>I want to get outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

573
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:31.060
<v Speaker 1>It was one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to get out of here.</v>

574
00:30:31.061 --> 00:30:31.990
<v Speaker 1>I just want to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

575
00:30:31.991 --> 00:30:36.991
<v Speaker 1>it was not a pro war Rah Rah Rah thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something that the folks at home </v>

576
00:30:36.991 --> 00:30:37.150
<v Speaker 1>would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my goodness,</v>

577
00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.650
<v Speaker 1>now here's two sides to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

578
00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:44.970
<v Speaker 1>side number one is that's reality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>please put me firmly in the camp of,</v>

579
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:50.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to go to these wars and </v>

580
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:52.051
<v Speaker 1>you can expect people to support them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to know what it is and they </v>

581
00:30:52.051 --> 00:30:52.870
<v Speaker 1>have to know what it is in living color </v>
<v Speaker 1>just like that.</v>

582
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:56.380
<v Speaker 1>So I'm on that side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's understand that the other side</v>

583
00:30:56.381 --> 00:31:01.381
<v Speaker 1>is Max Hastings points out in this book </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't show their people that kind of </v>

584
00:31:01.381 --> 00:31:01.390
<v Speaker 1>press coverage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

585
00:31:01.391 --> 00:31:04.780
<v Speaker 1>So they're rigidly controlling what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communist people see.</v>

586
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.840
<v Speaker 1>They don't get to see all their death or</v>
<v Speaker 1>their suffering all their atrocities and</v>

587
00:31:07.841 --> 00:31:12.841
<v Speaker 1>the other side's got it in living color.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And our friends who don't like us so </v>

588
00:31:12.841 --> 00:31:13.900
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were some countries that love hate</v>

589
00:31:13.901 --> 00:31:15.550
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do they play this stuff up?</v>

590
00:31:15.551 --> 00:31:20.551
<v Speaker 1>Huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'll notice we didn't have </v>

591
00:31:20.551 --> 00:31:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Americans doing much protesting during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second world war.</v>

592
00:31:21.221 --> 00:31:26.221
<v Speaker 1>We were bombing Germany and Japan and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't had by Vietnam standards much in</v>

593
00:31:27.161 --> 00:31:30.220
<v Speaker 1>the way of those things since Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a few big ones,</v>

594
00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:32.200
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing's to stain Vietnam,</v>

595
00:31:32.201 --> 00:31:36.460
<v Speaker 1>the sustained pressure with lots and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of people protesting for long time.</v>

596
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:38.140
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had that sense either.</v>

597
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Could you suggest that maybe it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they aren't being exposed to the</v>

598
00:31:44.051 --> 00:31:49.051
<v Speaker 1>same sort of a video and photos and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories that the American people saw in </v>

599
00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:54.520
<v Speaker 1>the 1960 [inaudible] and 19 seventies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

600
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:57.220
<v Speaker 1>if so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can call that one of the,</v>

601
00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:02.340
<v Speaker 1>I guess successful reforms that the army</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Navy and Marine Corp leaders,</v>

602
00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.820
<v Speaker 1>the Air Force leader is learned from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that era.</v>

603
00:32:06.821 --> 00:32:09.190
<v Speaker 1>If they believed that the war was lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the living room.</v>

604
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do that again and we don't.</v>

605
00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:16.030
<v Speaker 1>But back in supermax Max Hastings Day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did.</v>

606
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:20.020
<v Speaker 1>So I'm pleased to introduce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've never heard him,</v>

607
00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:21.790
<v Speaker 1>well my goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you never read his books,</v>

608
00:32:21.791 --> 00:32:26.530
<v Speaker 1>if you're a military history fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you have a whole bunch to pick</v>

609
00:32:26.531 --> 00:32:26.980
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

610
00:32:26.981 --> 00:32:28.240
<v Speaker 1>in Ferno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go get in front of.</v>

611
00:32:28.241 --> 00:32:30.370
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this latest one of Vietnam also.</v>

612
00:32:30.371 --> 00:32:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

613
00:32:31.631 --> 00:32:33.030
<v Speaker 1>so without further ado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

614
00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:37.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm honored to talk to Sir Max Hastings </v>
<v Speaker 1>today about his new book,</v>

615
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam.</v>

616
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.800
<v Speaker 2>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Max?</v>

617
00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:43.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

618
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:46.630
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you so much.</v>

619
00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:48.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they've got you on the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>publicity,</v>

620
00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:53.580
<v Speaker 2>a factory assembly line to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll try to make this as painless and </v>

621
00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:53.580
<v Speaker 2>fun as possible.</v>

622
00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:55.610
<v Speaker 3>It'll be completely painless.</v>

623
00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan actually.</v>

624
00:32:58.911 --> 00:33:00.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will admit though,</v>

625
00:33:00.561 --> 00:33:01.940
<v Speaker 2>I haven't gotten through the latest </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

626
00:33:01.941 --> 00:33:05.150
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get it in time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm enjoying it immensely though,</v>

627
00:33:05.151 --> 00:33:10.151
<v Speaker 2>and it's a subject near and dear to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>heart as all Americans and in my </v>

628
00:33:10.151 --> 00:33:11.540
<v Speaker 2>generation probably had no way to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

629
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:15.810
<v Speaker 2>I was born during the battle of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

630
00:33:15.811 --> 00:33:16.800
<v Speaker 2>of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drank valley,</v>

631
00:33:16.801 --> 00:33:18.510
<v Speaker 2>so November 14th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1965.</v>

632
00:33:18.511 --> 00:33:19.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm 52.</v>

633
00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.590
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that makes you a generation younger</v>

634
00:33:22.591 --> 00:33:23.010
<v Speaker 3>than me.</v>

635
00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:24.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

636
00:33:24.221 --> 00:33:29.221
<v Speaker 2>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I want to talk about that a little </v>

637
00:33:29.221 --> 00:33:30.661
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating to read something from </v>

638
00:33:30.661 --> 00:33:33.830
<v Speaker 2>a 21st century perspective that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually grew up in,</v>

639
00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:36.980
<v Speaker 2>in the wake or the wash of a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was wondering,</v>

640
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:43.320
<v Speaker 2>how different is this book from </v>
<v Speaker 2>something you would have written much </v>

641
00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.580
<v Speaker 2>more closer to the time you were in </v>
<v Speaker 2>country now,</v>

642
00:33:45.581 --> 00:33:46.890
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience doesn't know this.</v>

643
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:48.460
<v Speaker 2>Let me make sure that they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

644
00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:50.560
<v Speaker 2>this is a book from a British </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

645
00:33:50.561 --> 00:33:53.020
<v Speaker 2>which we don't normally get with Vietnam</v>
<v Speaker 2>war books.</v>

646
00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:54.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>

647
00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also able to,</v>

648
00:33:56.561 --> 00:33:58.570
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give us a 21st century,</v>

649
00:33:58.571 --> 00:34:03.571
<v Speaker 2>look back at something that many of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>books I was reading were written in the </v>

650
00:34:03.571 --> 00:34:04.270
<v Speaker 2>19 eighties for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you were actually there.</v>

651
00:34:04.271 --> 00:34:06.400
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so give me a perspective a little bit on</v>

652
00:34:06.401 --> 00:34:08.320
<v Speaker 2>how writing this book now was different </v>
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>

653
00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:13.150
<v Speaker 2>than how the 25 or 28 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sir Max Hastings would have written it.</v>

654
00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:23.480
<v Speaker 3>Stupid officer back in the 19 sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although I'm British America and its </v>

655
00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:30.880
<v Speaker 3>history has been deeply etched into my </v>
<v Speaker 3>own experience because I lived here in </v>

656
00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.410
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 67 or 68.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

657
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:35.860
<v Speaker 3>and I witnessed up the huge </v>
<v Speaker 3>demonstrations.</v>

658
00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:41.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met a lot of the key players of the </v>

659
00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:41.320
<v Speaker 3>Robert Kennedy's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Eugene McCarthy is,</v>

660
00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:46.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I went the White House and listened </v>

661
00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:50.321
<v Speaker 3>to Lyndon Johnson haranguing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a group of US foreign journalists about </v>

662
00:34:50.321 --> 00:34:53.990
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about why he was so passionate and </v>

663
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.920
<v Speaker 3>committed to the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was in January 1968.</v>

664
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:59.870
<v Speaker 3>And of course we were hugely impressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be meeting the president.</v>

665
00:34:59.871 --> 00:35:04.871
<v Speaker 3>That was me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>22 years old sitting in the cabinet </v>

666
00:35:04.871 --> 00:35:04.871
<v Speaker 3>role.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

667
00:35:04.871 --> 00:35:06.140
<v Speaker 3>Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He behaved in many ways,</v>

668
00:35:06.141 --> 00:35:10.310
<v Speaker 3>quite like his character to in the dea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Started out by saying saying,</v>

669
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:15.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of you may like blondes and some </v>

670
00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:16.130
<v Speaker 3>who may like redheads and some of you </v>
<v Speaker 3>may not like women at all,</v>

671
00:35:16.131 --> 00:35:18.700
<v Speaker 3>but I'm here this morning to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind I like.</v>

672
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:24.040
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm prepared to sit down with Holcim in </v>

673
00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.300
<v Speaker 3>a nice hotel with nice food and sit down</v>
<v Speaker 3>to talk to settle this thing.</v>

674
00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.720
<v Speaker 3>And he spoke for 40 minutes and then he </v>
<v Speaker 3>got up and he didn't take questions,</v>

675
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:31.430
<v Speaker 3>you said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

676
00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.170
<v Speaker 3>Very nice to meet you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Already went out the room.</v>

677
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:38.890
<v Speaker 3>But then suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just as we were gathering together all </v>

678
00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:40.440
<v Speaker 3>notes and we'd been hugely impressed </v>
<v Speaker 3>those how could we not be.</v>

679
00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm an I was by far the youngest of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>group,</v>

680
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:46.090
<v Speaker 3>but nonetheless we were all quite a </v>
<v Speaker 3>young group and meeting the president of</v>

681
00:35:46.091 --> 00:35:51.091
<v Speaker 3>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But suddenly he put his head round the </v>

682
00:35:51.091 --> 00:35:54.021
<v Speaker 3>door again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little bit sheepishly and he came </v>

683
00:35:54.021 --> 00:35:54.690
<v Speaker 3>back in and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before you all go,</v>

684
00:35:54.691 --> 00:35:58.470
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to ask your one question </v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting me.</v>

685
00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:03.620
<v Speaker 3>Have any of you changed your minds about</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything you've read or heard about </v>

686
00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:03.620
<v Speaker 3>maybe before you came?</v>

687
00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:07.950
<v Speaker 3>And we were absolutely stunned into </v>
<v Speaker 3>silence by spectacle as the president of</v>

688
00:36:07.951 --> 00:36:12.951
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm carrying six months what a load of </v>

689
00:36:12.951 --> 00:36:16.370
<v Speaker 3>kids like us thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that was a reflection of how </v>

690
00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:16.920
<v Speaker 3>vulnerable Johnson felt that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then of course,</v>

691
00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:21.230
<v Speaker 3>couple of years later I went to Vietnam </v>
<v Speaker 3>for BBC television on.</v>

692
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:26.840
<v Speaker 3>I did quite a lot of reporting there </v>
<v Speaker 3>right through until 75 when I came out </v>

693
00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.500
<v Speaker 3>of the embassy compound and the final </v>
<v Speaker 3>evacuation.</v>

694
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:31.860
<v Speaker 3>So this was all etched,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deepen my experience.</v>

695
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:37.190
<v Speaker 3>But the key thing that has changed </v>
<v Speaker 3>meanwhile is that I very much bought </v>

696
00:36:38.341 --> 00:36:42.780
<v Speaker 3>into the idea that not only was this a </v>
<v Speaker 3>disastrous war,</v>

697
00:36:42.781 --> 00:36:46.230
<v Speaker 3>which indeed it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the because of the United States was</v>

698
00:36:46.231 --> 00:36:50.130
<v Speaker 3>tied up with a bad cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Therefore the other sides must be a good</v>

699
00:36:50.131 --> 00:36:55.131
<v Speaker 3>cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've come to believe having studied </v>

700
00:36:55.131 --> 00:36:59.290
<v Speaker 3>a huge amount of material from north </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam and from the communist side and </v>

701
00:36:59.290 --> 00:36:59.290
<v Speaker 3>so on.</v>

702
00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:04.180
<v Speaker 3>That's really north Vietnam and South </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam I've come to believe were two </v>

703
00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:08.871
<v Speaker 3>rival tyrannies and the idea that g men </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a good guy anymore than march its </v>

704
00:37:08.871 --> 00:37:13.590
<v Speaker 3>own walls or Jay Guevara.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These were absolutely ruthless </v>

705
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:15.360
<v Speaker 3>revolutionary and they did terrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

706
00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:20.740
<v Speaker 3>And whereas everybody has seen the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures of the south Vietnamese police </v>

707
00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:25.611
<v Speaker 3>chief of executing the viet cong </v>
<v Speaker 3>prisoner in 1968 on the naked kid </v>

708
00:37:25.711 --> 00:37:28.530
<v Speaker 3>running away after a south Vietnamese </v>
<v Speaker 3>napalm strike.</v>

709
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:34.190
<v Speaker 3>The communists made very sure that when </v>
<v Speaker 3>our photographs of many of the dreadful </v>

710
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:37.690
<v Speaker 3>things that their side did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the terrorism that I'm in,</v>

711
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:42.710
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a entirely reliable or story of one </v>

712
00:37:42.811 --> 00:37:47.811
<v Speaker 3>among many village chiefs who was being </v>
<v Speaker 3>buried alive in the Mekong Delta in the </v>

713
00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:54.050
<v Speaker 3>early 19 sixties by the local communists</v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of all these fellow villages to</v>

714
00:37:54.721 --> 00:37:59.721
<v Speaker 3>demonstrate that the price of all on </v>
<v Speaker 3>redacting the revolution was much worse </v>

715
00:37:59.911 --> 00:38:04.911
<v Speaker 3>than death and he pleaded for most of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our bullet and the prominence cadres </v>

716
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:07.410
<v Speaker 3>just said that they save the bullets for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

717
00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:12.890
<v Speaker 3>for the imperialists and in the tet </v>
<v Speaker 3>offensive of 1968 when thousands of </v>

718
00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.450
<v Speaker 3>perfectly innocent people whose worse </v>
<v Speaker 3>crime as to support the south.</v>

719
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:22.500
<v Speaker 3>That means government were executed in </v>
<v Speaker 3>cold blood by the Communist.</v>

720
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:27.740
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no pictures of we didn't see all this </v>

721
00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.651
<v Speaker 3>stuff and I've come to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>although I don't believe for a moment </v>

722
00:38:31.771 --> 00:38:33.920
<v Speaker 3>that the war was winnable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we weren't.</v>

723
00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:37.060
<v Speaker 3>We did allow ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those of us who were correspondence that</v>

724
00:38:37.061 --> 00:38:39.010
<v Speaker 3>are all those of us who are reporting </v>
<v Speaker 3>the war.</v>

725
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:45.150
<v Speaker 3>All we could see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and most of the stuff we were writing </v>

726
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:48.031
<v Speaker 3>about was what a terrible mess United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States and the South Vietnamese were </v>

727
00:38:48.031 --> 00:38:52.321
<v Speaker 3>making of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yet we saw in 1975 that when the </v>

728
00:38:52.321 --> 00:38:53.750
<v Speaker 3>communists game par,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

729
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:57.080
<v Speaker 3>the ruthlessness and the incompetence </v>
<v Speaker 3>with which they behaved,</v>

730
00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:03.090
<v Speaker 3>starvation descended on the Vietnamese </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in the 19 eighties and any idea </v>

731
00:39:03.371 --> 00:39:08.371
<v Speaker 3>that the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're the good guys now seems to be out </v>

732
00:39:08.371 --> 00:39:08.371
<v Speaker 3>of order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've come very strongly to believe.</v>

733
00:39:08.371 --> 00:39:13.260
<v Speaker 3>One is to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of most events in history that neither </v>

734
00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.470
<v Speaker 3>side had a monopoly of a virtue or vice.</v>

735
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:19.470
<v Speaker 3>So that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The second thing I think is hugely </v>

736
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:21.790
<v Speaker 3>important is that we are overwhelmingly </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact.</v>

737
00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.880
<v Speaker 3>We were with the Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

738
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:26.590
<v Speaker 3>and with the US army and the US Marine </v>
<v Speaker 3>Corps and so on.</v>

739
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.840
<v Speaker 3>And we saw this through an American </v>
<v Speaker 3>prison.</v>

740
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:32.830
<v Speaker 3>And yet this was overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're Vietnamese tragedy.</v>

741
00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.250
<v Speaker 3>But while 58,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans died in Vietnam,</v>

742
00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:40.420
<v Speaker 3>something over 2 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2 million Vietnamese died,</v>

743
00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:45.840
<v Speaker 3>at least 40 for every American.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not to mention countless low on </v>

744
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:49.951
<v Speaker 3>Cambodians as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I spent a huge amount of time </v>

745
00:39:49.951 --> 00:39:53.940
<v Speaker 3>researching a Vietnamese sources and </v>
<v Speaker 3>interviewing Vietnamese and sure there </v>

746
00:39:53.941 --> 00:39:58.941
<v Speaker 3>are a lot of Americans in my story </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the Americans made the big </v>

747
00:39:58.941 --> 00:40:02.461
<v Speaker 3>decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've also tried to put the </v>

748
00:40:02.461 --> 00:40:06.031
<v Speaker 3>Vietnamese where they belong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the central of the stage of </v>

749
00:40:06.031 --> 00:40:06.310
<v Speaker 3>this huge tragedy.</v>

750
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:11.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you bring up an interesting </v>

751
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:13.451
<v Speaker 2>quandary that people can understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're confronted with it not </v>

752
00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.770
<v Speaker 2>uncommonly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in the modern world,</v>

753
00:40:15.771 --> 00:40:19.070
<v Speaker 2>which is with the communist as bad as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

754
00:40:19.071 --> 00:40:24.071
<v Speaker 2>and doing all these things you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about without knowing how the </v>

755
00:40:24.071 --> 00:40:27.941
<v Speaker 2>war was gonna turn out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that legitimize the involvement of </v>

756
00:40:27.941 --> 00:40:29.480
<v Speaker 2>a of one of the two great superpowers of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time?</v>

757
00:40:29.481 --> 00:40:31.400
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you make a moral case that the right</v>

758
00:40:31.401 --> 00:40:36.401
<v Speaker 2>thing was done because this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing was happening and it was </v>

759
00:40:36.401 --> 00:40:36.401
<v Speaker 2>understood that if the communists took </v>
<v Speaker 2>over South Vietnam,</v>

760
00:40:36.401 --> 00:40:37.880
<v Speaker 2>there'd be a bloodbath and all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things,</v>

761
00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:43.180
<v Speaker 2>and yet all of the things that you talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about in the later part of your book </v>

762
00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:47.231
<v Speaker 2>after the US get involved shows exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>how nasty it is for the Vietnamese </v>

763
00:40:47.231 --> 00:40:51.731
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you pointed out when we did get </v>

764
00:40:51.731 --> 00:40:52.160
<v Speaker 2>involved for all the right reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How should you know?</v>

765
00:40:52.161 --> 00:40:57.161
<v Speaker 2>Fifty years of thinking about this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing how things play out in the </v>

766
00:40:57.161 --> 00:41:01.001
<v Speaker 2>region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you square the difference </v>

767
00:41:01.001 --> 00:41:01.001
<v Speaker 2>between.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be morally right to go in there</v>

768
00:41:01.001 --> 00:41:04.250
<v Speaker 2>and try to save these people from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible fate and yet while doing so,</v>

769
00:41:04.251 --> 00:41:06.320
<v Speaker 2>inflicted even worse fade on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

770
00:41:06.321 --> 00:41:07.670
<v Speaker 2>how do you square?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that.</v>

771
00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:08.990
<v Speaker 2>How does that go in your head these </v>
<v Speaker 2>days?</v>

772
00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:16.460
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In my book to people who I got to know a</v>

773
00:41:19.851 --> 00:41:24.851
<v Speaker 3>bit when I was a young reporter covering</v>
<v Speaker 3>his campaign in 68 general gave Jim </v>

774
00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:28.240
<v Speaker 3>Galvin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whom I also knew who was a world war two</v>

775
00:41:28.241 --> 00:41:32.680
<v Speaker 3>power true here on Jim Gavin and Eugene </v>
<v Speaker 3>McCarthy.</v>

776
00:41:32.681 --> 00:41:35.960
<v Speaker 3>Both said I'm at a pretty early stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

777
00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.560
<v Speaker 3>whatever the virtue of your cause,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you fight over a village of five or </v>

778
00:41:41.871 --> 00:41:46.871
<v Speaker 3>six times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an awful lot of people are going to die </v>

779
00:41:46.871 --> 00:41:49.811
<v Speaker 3>and you find yourself thinking at some </v>
<v Speaker 3>point there's got to be some </v>

780
00:41:49.811 --> 00:41:52.481
<v Speaker 3>proportionality that even if what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to achieve in a place and </v>

781
00:41:53.451 --> 00:41:56.160
<v Speaker 3>especially in Vietnam is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is uh,</v>

782
00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:01.300
<v Speaker 3>something that is worthwhile and decent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in the end you find yourself in </v>

783
00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.890
<v Speaker 3>danger of destroying the very thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to try to save on.</v>

784
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:07.820
<v Speaker 3>The has to be proportionality on one </v>
<v Speaker 3>point,</v>

785
00:42:07.821 --> 00:42:12.821
<v Speaker 3>which is at the core of my own book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that I think a mistake we've made in </v>

786
00:42:12.831 --> 00:42:16.220
<v Speaker 3>the past and we go on making and </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember the British have been very much</v>

787
00:42:16.221 --> 00:42:20.060
<v Speaker 3>associated with the United States in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Iraq and in Afghanistan and so on.</v>

788
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:24.860
<v Speaker 3>Is that although there has to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>military dimension,</v>

789
00:42:24.861 --> 00:42:26.330
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to do these </v>
<v Speaker 3>interventions,</v>

790
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.950
<v Speaker 3>the key thing is always cultural and </v>
<v Speaker 3>social and economic,</v>

791
00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:36.050
<v Speaker 3>and if you can't have some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultural engagement with these societies</v>

792
00:42:36.051 --> 00:42:39.050
<v Speaker 3>in which you intervene,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're completely wasting your time</v>

793
00:42:39.051 --> 00:42:44.051
<v Speaker 3>winning firefights and to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've said this in the last chapter </v>

794
00:42:44.051 --> 00:42:48.461
<v Speaker 3>of my book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go on winning firefights and these </v>

795
00:42:48.461 --> 00:42:48.560
<v Speaker 3>bases and killing bad guys till the cows</v>
<v Speaker 3>come home,</v>

796
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:53.450
<v Speaker 3>but unless you've got some linkage with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the local people,</v>

797
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:57.350
<v Speaker 3>and I was always very struck by somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's become a friend.</v>

798
00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:02.380
<v Speaker 3>Hr mcmaster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who more recently was Donald Trump's </v>

799
00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:05.360
<v Speaker 3>national security advisor that hr </v>
<v Speaker 3>mcmaster,</v>

800
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:08.150
<v Speaker 3>who's an outstanding American army </v>
<v Speaker 3>officer.</v>

801
00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:11.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one day about 2006,</v>

802
00:43:11.061 --> 00:43:16.061
<v Speaker 3>we were having lunch together and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling me about all the great things </v>

803
00:43:16.061 --> 00:43:18.260
<v Speaker 3>that his armored calvary regiment had </v>
<v Speaker 3>done in Iraq.</v>

804
00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:23.090
<v Speaker 3>And then he ended up by saying the </v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble was there was nothing to join up</v>

805
00:43:23.091 --> 00:43:24.440
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

806
00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:28.160
<v Speaker 3>what he meant was that there was no sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of local government,</v>

807
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:33.190
<v Speaker 3>the local community to be able to fill </v>
<v Speaker 3>in after they'd finished winning the </v>

808
00:43:34.731 --> 00:43:37.950
<v Speaker 3>battles and exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neil Sheehan,</v>

809
00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:40.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm a very famous American correspondent</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Vietnam.</v>

810
00:43:40.941 --> 00:43:43.070
<v Speaker 3>When I was telling him that story a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of years ago,</v>

811
00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:48.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were discussing and you said it was </v>

812
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.710
<v Speaker 3>the same problem in Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing to join up to.</v>

813
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:53.680
<v Speaker 3>And I've said in my book that I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>the main reason that the communists </v>

814
00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:57.071
<v Speaker 3>ended up winning in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Vietnam was not because they were </v>

815
00:43:57.071 --> 00:44:01.181
<v Speaker 3>particularly better soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because they were Vietnamese and </v>

816
00:44:01.181 --> 00:44:04.700
<v Speaker 3>always this problem and it's one sees it</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Iraq and Afghanistan again,</v>

817
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.090
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of the time the locals don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>like foreigners,</v>

818
00:44:08.091 --> 00:44:09.950
<v Speaker 3>whether they are British or American or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

819
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:12.440
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

820
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:17.550
<v Speaker 3>I talked to a Vietnamese who's now </v>
<v Speaker 3>become a very successful businessman in </v>

821
00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:21.620
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was saying to me that when he was</v>

822
00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:26.770
<v Speaker 3>living in Vietnam as a young man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you said the communists were constantly </v>

823
00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:30.710
<v Speaker 3>reminding us how humiliating it was to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be occupied by the Americans.</v>

824
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:34.020
<v Speaker 3>They had the monopoly of patriotism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

825
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.900
<v Speaker 3>what we have to find ways of doing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>these interventions is,</v>

826
00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:43.010
<v Speaker 3>is hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while trying to help these people we </v>

827
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:44.430
<v Speaker 3>can't take over their country is out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

828
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:48.030
<v Speaker 3>the United States was effectively 64,</v>
<v Speaker 3>65.</v>

829
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:54.470
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knew that the South Vietnamese</v>
<v Speaker 3>who were supposed to be running the </v>

830
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:57.861
<v Speaker 3>country couldn't get out of bed in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning without asking the Americans </v>

831
00:44:57.861 --> 00:45:01.251
<v Speaker 3>which side to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the Communists were able to exploit </v>

832
00:45:01.251 --> 00:45:03.540
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So although I'm in any idea that was all</v>

833
00:45:03.541 --> 00:45:08.541
<v Speaker 3>the kids thought in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a sort of saintly figure out </v>

834
00:45:08.541 --> 00:45:09.870
<v Speaker 3>members,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a ruthless revolutionary,</v>

835
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:15.500
<v Speaker 3>but he achieved a state of status or </v>
<v Speaker 3>stature as the victor in the colonial </v>

836
00:45:17.971 --> 00:45:22.110
<v Speaker 3>war against the French,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which the United States and the,</v>

837
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.150
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the what the United States called.</v>

838
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:26.130
<v Speaker 3>I've still got my old press card from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam.</v>

839
00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:31.340
<v Speaker 3>Free Weld forces were never able to find</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody who looked like the Patriots and</v>

840
00:45:31.831 --> 00:45:33.440
<v Speaker 3>the hero and the nationalist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how'd she.</v>

841
00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:36.540
<v Speaker 3>Men died on the southern side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

842
00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:39.990
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The longer I write history books and the</v>

843
00:45:39.991 --> 00:45:44.991
<v Speaker 3>more you come to learn that very often </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't say it's good Vivo on the </v>

844
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:51.620
<v Speaker 3>blackfeet why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These things were always very </v>

845
00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:52.800
<v Speaker 3>complicated and I felt even when I was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>young reporter in Vietnam,</v>

846
00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.430
<v Speaker 3>I never thought the United States look </v>
<v Speaker 3>like winning this war,</v>

847
00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:59.820
<v Speaker 3>but even then I never felt the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>side deserved to either.</v>

848
00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:05.570
<v Speaker 2>You bring up some very interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>points in the book of things that make </v>

849
00:46:06.261 --> 00:46:09.100
<v Speaker 2>you feel like the government is inept </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you realize,</v>

850
00:46:09.101 --> 00:46:11.710
<v Speaker 2>but we do it over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe it's built into the,</v>

851
00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:12.850
<v Speaker 2>to the cake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we say.</v>

852
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:18.030
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to piggyback off the point you just </v>

853
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:20.971
<v Speaker 2>made about the south Vietnamese </v>
<v Speaker 2>government trying to appear as though </v>

854
00:46:20.971 --> 00:46:20.971
<v Speaker 2>you know they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

855
00:46:20.971 --> 00:46:25.530
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fighting as much of a </v>

856
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:27.301
<v Speaker 2>nationalist war as the north is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yet when we first put marines on </v>

857
00:46:27.301 --> 00:46:30.190
<v Speaker 2>shore in 1965,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you put pointed out in your book,</v>

858
00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:34.060
<v Speaker 2>we didn't even tell the south Vietnamese</v>
<v Speaker 2>government we were going to do it.</v>

859
00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Those are the kinds of things where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have loved to have been a fly on </v>

860
00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.050
<v Speaker 2>the wall in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the meetings about this.</v>

861
00:46:41.051 --> 00:46:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Did somebody bring that up and say this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to look really bad if,</v>

862
00:46:43.591 --> 00:46:48.591
<v Speaker 2>if if we spring this on them or was it </v>
<v Speaker 2>or was the tenor of the times such that </v>

863
00:46:48.591 --> 00:46:53.401
<v Speaker 2>worrying about what a puppet government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess maybe some people would have </v>

864
00:46:53.401 --> 00:46:56.710
<v Speaker 2>called it thought about this was was not</v>
<v Speaker 2>on their top 10 list of concerns.</v>

865
00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:02.100
<v Speaker 3>You're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that always struck me </v>

866
00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:05.291
<v Speaker 3>as I also said in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the hot shot meetings in Washington </v>

867
00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:12.050
<v Speaker 3>about Vietnam policy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no Vietnamese ever attended any of them.</v>

868
00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:17.140
<v Speaker 3>It was always Americans who held the </v>
<v Speaker 3>meetings to decide what was going to be </v>

869
00:47:18.081 --> 00:47:21.710
<v Speaker 3>done in Saigon and you find,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again I have quoted all the examples</v>

870
00:47:21.711 --> 00:47:26.711
<v Speaker 3>were several times when they discussed </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Washington whether they should change</v>

871
00:47:26.871 --> 00:47:31.380
<v Speaker 3>the Vietnamese government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when president two and 1970,</v>

872
00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:32.940
<v Speaker 3>74,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

873
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:38.190
<v Speaker 3>73 look like refusing to sign the peace </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal that Henry Kissinger and stitched </v>

874
00:47:38.711 --> 00:47:41.200
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in Paris with the North Vietnamese.</v>

875
00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:45.730
<v Speaker 3>There was a serious discussion in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington about whether to just get rid</v>

876
00:47:45.731 --> 00:47:48.220
<v Speaker 3>of president to input in another </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnamese president.</v>

877
00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:53.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not too surprising that the </v>

878
00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:53.880
<v Speaker 3>Vietnamese feel humiliated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

879
00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:58.201
<v Speaker 3>all human relations about who makes her </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel good and Americans did not make,</v>

880
00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:00.220
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnamese feel good.</v>

881
00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:02.440
<v Speaker 3>And I say this is not unique to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans.</v>

882
00:48:02.441 --> 00:48:07.441
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it myself in Afghanistan with </v>

883
00:48:07.441 --> 00:48:07.890
<v Speaker 3>British troops and Salma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

884
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:13.230
<v Speaker 3>unless you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I don't particularly like that </v>

885
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:13.230
<v Speaker 3>phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hearts and minds,</v>

886
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:18.100
<v Speaker 3>unless you can make and help other </v>
<v Speaker 3>nations to have self respect and to feel</v>

887
00:48:18.101 --> 00:48:20.290
<v Speaker 3>good about themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

888
00:48:20.370 --> 00:48:22.510
<v Speaker 3>it's always going to be already a tough </v>
<v Speaker 3>row to hoe.</v>

889
00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:27.780
<v Speaker 3>But one thing I do want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I've also tried to get into my </v>

890
00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:30.901
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do think that Americans today are </v>

891
00:48:30.901 --> 00:48:32.350
<v Speaker 3>sometimes almost floods and atria and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their approach to the war.</v>

892
00:48:32.351 --> 00:48:33.100
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

893
00:48:33.101 --> 00:48:35.050
<v Speaker 3>We were so wicked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

894
00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.780
<v Speaker 3>although there's no doubt the war was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>disaster.</v>

895
00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:43.680
<v Speaker 3>A lot of Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of whom I've interviewed for the </v>

896
00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.190
<v Speaker 3>book went to Vietnam where the highest </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideals of service,</v>

897
00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:50.110
<v Speaker 3>both some soldiers and some civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been hugely moved by.</v>

898
00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:52.030
<v Speaker 3>Some of the Americans I interviewed for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the book.</v>

899
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:56.680
<v Speaker 3>They really cared some of the civilians,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the language.</v>

900
00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:01.920
<v Speaker 3>They completely threw themselves into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing and they weren't sort of</v>

901
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:07.950
<v Speaker 3>wicked imperialists who wanted to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible things that they were people </v>

902
00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:13.020
<v Speaker 3>who really wanted to do good deeds and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>wicked world and I think that a lot of </v>

903
00:49:13.721 --> 00:49:18.721
<v Speaker 3>the histories of the war don't pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>sufficient tribute to some of these </v>

904
00:49:18.721 --> 00:49:18.721
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

905
00:49:18.721 --> 00:49:21.040
<v Speaker 3>one guy who made an enormous impression </v>
<v Speaker 3>on me,</v>

906
00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:26.520
<v Speaker 3>I was done on the west coast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm interviewing Vietnamese and I heard </v>

907
00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.480
<v Speaker 3>about a guy called Dave Ramsey who might</v>
<v Speaker 3>heard about it,</v>

908
00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:32.890
<v Speaker 3>but I never had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was still alive and I was told he was</v>

909
00:49:32.891 --> 00:49:37.891
<v Speaker 3>still alive and living in boulder city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nevada and I looked at the map and it </v>

910
00:49:37.891 --> 00:49:41.740
<v Speaker 3>was more than 300 miles driving my car </v>
<v Speaker 3>over from the west coast,</v>

911
00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:42.580
<v Speaker 3>the boulder city.</v>

912
00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:47.580
<v Speaker 3>But I just thought I may be able to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>and see this guy and I got the car and </v>

913
00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:52.310
<v Speaker 3>it's a hell of a long drive across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>desert and I got to build a city on.</v>

914
00:49:52.311 --> 00:49:57.311
<v Speaker 3>There was Doug Ramsey and I spent four </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours with him and it was an amazing </v>

915
00:49:57.311 --> 00:50:00.250
<v Speaker 3>business because Doug Ramsey was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign service officer,</v>

916
00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:05.080
<v Speaker 3>a really outstanding American who I'm in</v>
<v Speaker 3>1962.</v>

917
00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:10.320
<v Speaker 3>He made up his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wants you to go and serve in Vietnam </v>

918
00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:14.370
<v Speaker 3>and was involved in pacification </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs or systems for time to John </v>

919
00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:16.610
<v Speaker 3>Paul Vann the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

920
00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:19.870
<v Speaker 3>the very famous American advisor out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

921
00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:24.910
<v Speaker 3>And Doug Ramsey passionately cared about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Vietnamese.</v>

922
00:50:24.911 --> 00:50:27.010
<v Speaker 3>He learned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He learned Vietnamese.</v>

923
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:27.860
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

924
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:30.560
<v Speaker 3>he wrote a lot of stuff for some of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>letters home,</v>

925
00:50:30.561 --> 00:50:32.300
<v Speaker 3>which you gave me were huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hugely moving.</v>

926
00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:37.810
<v Speaker 3>But then beginning of 66,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was driving a truck with a load of </v>

927
00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:41.360
<v Speaker 3>rise up to some village and he got out </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bush by the Viet Cong and captured on.</v>

928
00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:44.600
<v Speaker 3>He spent the next seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in the Hilton,</v>

929
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:49.330
<v Speaker 3>but in a bamboo cage in the jungle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seven years you have malaria,</v>

930
00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:54.350
<v Speaker 3>123 times he had every kind of other </v>
<v Speaker 3>tropical disease are you survive?</v>

931
00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:59.300
<v Speaker 3>God only knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yet he came out of this experience,</v>

932
00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:02.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is health absolutely destroyed.</v>

933
00:51:02.661 --> 00:51:03.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I saw him,</v>

934
00:51:03.471 --> 00:51:08.471
<v Speaker 3>he could hardly move his body at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his mind was still right on and he </v>

935
00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:13.691
<v Speaker 3>taught so moving live because even </v>
<v Speaker 3>though he'd suffered so terribly at the </v>

936
00:51:13.691 --> 00:51:15.270
<v Speaker 3>hands of the Communist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

937
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:20.530
<v Speaker 3>that he was completely even handed in </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing the good stuff and the bad stuff </v>

938
00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:24.101
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he knew the Viet Cong having been a </v>

939
00:51:24.101 --> 00:51:24.101
<v Speaker 3>prisoner for seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better than almost anybody else.</v>

940
00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:26.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he taught me some very funny stories.</v>

941
00:51:26.331 --> 00:51:31.331
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them that always stuck in my </v>

942
00:51:31.331 --> 00:51:31.331
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

943
00:51:31.331 --> 00:51:34.000
<v Speaker 3>you said one day when he was being </v>
<v Speaker 3>interviewed by his interrogators and he </v>

944
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.711
<v Speaker 3>told them that he thought that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans were in Vietnam 10 percent to </v>

945
00:51:38.711 --> 00:51:43.231
<v Speaker 3>help the Vietnamese people are 90 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent to hold back the Chinese and </v>

946
00:51:43.231 --> 00:51:43.231
<v Speaker 3>artsy tongue.</v>

947
00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:46.700
<v Speaker 3>And he said the communist interrogator </v>
<v Speaker 3>applied.</v>

948
00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:52.090
<v Speaker 3>In that case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do you not go and fight him in </v>

949
00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:52.090
<v Speaker 3>China?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do not like the Chinese either.</v>

950
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:55.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another story he told,</v>

951
00:51:55.221 --> 00:52:00.221
<v Speaker 3>which was sort of somehow the subject of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Hayden came into conversation.</v>

952
00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:05.690
<v Speaker 3>Jane Fonda's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a husband who are of course fall in love</v>

953
00:52:05.691 --> 00:52:08.220
<v Speaker 3>with Oge men and Koa and spent half his </v>
<v Speaker 3>time in,</v>

954
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:11.570
<v Speaker 3>up in north Vietnam telling you the </v>
<v Speaker 3>North Vietnamese are wonderful.</v>

955
00:52:11.571 --> 00:52:15.830
<v Speaker 3>They were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when Tom Haynes name was mentioned,</v>

956
00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.240
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

957
00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:19.920
<v Speaker 3>Doug Ramsey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he asked his interrogators these.</v>

958
00:52:20.110 --> 00:52:20.540
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

959
00:52:20.541 --> 00:52:22.670
<v Speaker 3>what do you think of Tom Hayden?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>

960
00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:26.430
<v Speaker 3>we think his ideology is excellent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a man,</v>

961
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:29.150
<v Speaker 3>we despise him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could you respect to manual?</v>

962
00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:31.130
<v Speaker 3>But Tracy's own country like that,</v>

963
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:39.410
<v Speaker 2>alluded to it with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

964
00:52:39.411 --> 00:52:42.530
<v Speaker 2>these soldiers who went in here for such</v>
<v Speaker 2>idealistic reasons.</v>

965
00:52:42.531 --> 00:52:43.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you quoted a,</v>

966
00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:48.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man named Harry Williams who had </v>

967
00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:48.880
<v Speaker 2>mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

968
00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:49.820
<v Speaker 2>we were doing good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were making a real contribution.</v>

969
00:52:49.821 --> 00:52:51.800
<v Speaker 2>We were making things better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

970
00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:57.780
<v Speaker 2>it reminds me because I was sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>younger brother of that baby boom </v>

971
00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:01.991
<v Speaker 2>generation that gets so much heat these </v>
<v Speaker 2>days and so much flack and yet at the </v>

972
00:53:01.991 --> 00:53:05.291
<v Speaker 2>same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to not notice that that </v>

973
00:53:05.291 --> 00:53:07.841
<v Speaker 2>generation is a bunch of younger people </v>
<v Speaker 2>were extremely idealistic and motivated </v>

974
00:53:07.841 --> 00:53:09.740
<v Speaker 2>by their idealism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some went into the peace corps.</v>

975
00:53:09.741 --> 00:53:10.910
<v Speaker 2>A lot of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you point out,</v>

976
00:53:10.911 --> 00:53:13.940
<v Speaker 2>was in response to John f Kennedy's </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous sacrifice speech,</v>

977
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:19.150
<v Speaker 2>but some of these people did a similar </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of approach and trying to make the </v>

978
00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:23.021
<v Speaker 2>world a better place by doing what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned parachuting into Laos and </v>

979
00:53:23.021 --> 00:53:23.450
<v Speaker 2>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

980
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:28.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut off the Ho Chi Minh trail so that </v>

981
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:28.670
<v Speaker 2>the people in the south good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

982
00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:32.840
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating to know the word </v>

983
00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:33.720
<v Speaker 2>watershed moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The phrase watershed moment is overused,</v>

984
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.440
<v Speaker 2>but it's hard to not notice the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between 19,</v>

985
00:53:37.441 --> 00:53:42.441
<v Speaker 2>63 United States of America in 1973 </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States of America and not </v>

986
00:53:43.711 --> 00:53:48.711
<v Speaker 2>attribute a large part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>disillusionment and the change in </v>

987
00:53:48.711 --> 00:53:49.800
<v Speaker 2>attitudes to that war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that seem right?</v>

988
00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:57.350
<v Speaker 3>To go back to your question about why do</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people make the mistake</v>

989
00:54:01.971 --> 00:54:04.190
<v Speaker 3>when they look back at historical </v>
<v Speaker 3>events,</v>

990
00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.330
<v Speaker 3>but they look at them through a 2018 </v>
<v Speaker 3>prism.</v>

991
00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.670
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way to ride history is to close</v>

992
00:54:10.671 --> 00:54:13.280
<v Speaker 3>your eyes and try and remember how </v>
<v Speaker 3>things look to people.</v>

993
00:54:13.281 --> 00:54:17.500
<v Speaker 3>Then on the first thing to be said about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 19 fifties and sixties,</v>

994
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:22.430
<v Speaker 3>the really was a communist threat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but worldwide.</v>

995
00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

996
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:28.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Soviet Union and the Chinese did </v>

997
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.710
<v Speaker 3>represent deeply unpleasant totalitarian</v>
<v Speaker 3>forces of history.</v>

998
00:54:30.711 --> 00:54:35.711
<v Speaker 3>I'm quite confident will show that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States with absolutely right to </v>

999
00:54:35.711 --> 00:54:40.210
<v Speaker 3>lead the western nations in resisting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were the good guys in the Cold War </v>

1000
00:54:40.371 --> 00:54:44.330
<v Speaker 3>and I have no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes when people say,</v>

1001
00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:45.890
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1002
00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:51.260
<v Speaker 3>they never really was a common thread.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The most certainly was a communist </v>

1003
00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:51.260
<v Speaker 3>threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were very nice to people.</v>

1004
00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:56.380
<v Speaker 3>However they did not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did get a terrible tangle and into </v>

1005
00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:00.770
<v Speaker 3>China because there weren't enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in Washington who really </v>

1006
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:01.610
<v Speaker 3>understood the nuances and understood </v>
<v Speaker 3>the nuances,</v>

1007
00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:06.620
<v Speaker 3>the nationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things I discovered in </v>

1008
00:55:06.620 --> 00:55:09.791
<v Speaker 3>the course of researching the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I had no idea about the Chinese </v>

1009
00:55:09.791 --> 00:55:12.850
<v Speaker 3>and the Russians fall from being I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>enthusiastic about the Vietnam war,</v>

1010
00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:16.940
<v Speaker 3>hated the whole business because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were having to throw shed loads of money</v>

1011
00:55:16.941 --> 00:55:18.710
<v Speaker 3>and resources of weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1012
00:55:18.711 --> 00:55:23.711
<v Speaker 3>the Russians were giving the north </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnamese half a billion dollars a </v>

1013
00:55:23.711 --> 00:55:23.711
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they could afford,</v>

1014
00:55:23.711 --> 00:55:25.640
<v Speaker 3>but they felt because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Chinese,</v>

1015
00:55:25.641 --> 00:55:27.470
<v Speaker 3>the Russians for competing for </v>
<v Speaker 3>leadership,</v>

1016
00:55:27.830 --> 00:55:31.720
<v Speaker 3>all the socialist world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had to go on backing this war.</v>

1017
00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:36.970
<v Speaker 3>But our intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Western intelligence was so bad that </v>

1018
00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:39.380
<v Speaker 3>nobody had the inkling of the so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>right through to Nixon and Kissinger,</v>

1019
00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:43.660
<v Speaker 3>they still believed in the early </v>
<v Speaker 3>seventies that all our actions had to do</v>

1020
00:55:43.661 --> 00:55:46.130
<v Speaker 3>is pick up the phone to talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1021
00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.390
<v Speaker 3>I know I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1022
00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:50.150
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the north Vietnamese and make a deal.</v>

1023
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:55.390
<v Speaker 3>And it wasn't like that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That I've quoted Brezhnev when he was </v>

1024
00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:58.340
<v Speaker 3>leader Russia saying to the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 3>ambassador in Washington,</v>

1025
00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:02.300
<v Speaker 3>I have no desire to drown in the swamps </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Vietnam.</v>

1026
00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:06.800
<v Speaker 3>And he felt himself almost as much a </v>
<v Speaker 3>prisoner of all this stuff as,</v>

1027
00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:08.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the American step.</v>

1028
00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:14.080
<v Speaker 3>He hated it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were all stuck in this </v>

1029
00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:14.080
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing too,</v>

1030
00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.830
<v Speaker 3>which I saw the tail end of when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>living here in the sixties,</v>

1031
00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:21.890
<v Speaker 3>was that America after the Second World </v>
<v Speaker 3>War and had achieved such awesome </v>

1032
00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:25.450
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was so powerful and so rich,</v>

1033
00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:30.780
<v Speaker 3>but it seemed to that generation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans that nothing was impossible </v>

1034
00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:33.940
<v Speaker 3>and no presidents on this very much </v>
<v Speaker 3>applied to Lbj,</v>

1035
00:56:33.941 --> 00:56:38.941
<v Speaker 3>but also to Kennedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of them wanted to be the ones to </v>

1036
00:56:38.941 --> 00:56:42.271
<v Speaker 3>tell the American people that before </v>
<v Speaker 3>might of the United States couldn't see </v>

1037
00:56:42.271 --> 00:56:44.050
<v Speaker 3>often load a raggedy ass communist </v>
<v Speaker 3>guerrillas.</v>

1038
00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:49.590
<v Speaker 3>And there's a very good phrase of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy's that made a great impression </v>

1039
00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:49.590
<v Speaker 3>on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1040
00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:51.100
<v Speaker 3>I often hear people say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't believe it,</v>

1041
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:54.040
<v Speaker 3>but if Kennedy had lived either God </v>
<v Speaker 3>America out of Vietnam,</v>

1042
00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:58.360
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy told Jay k galbraith is key.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An economic advisor,</v>

1043
00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:00.850
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few weeks before he was killed,</v>

1044
00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:05.340
<v Speaker 3>he said they're only just so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>concessions I can make to the communists</v>

1045
00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:08.350
<v Speaker 3>in any one year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And asked the American people to reelect</v>

1046
00:57:08.351 --> 00:57:13.351
<v Speaker 3>me and American expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the belief among the American people,</v>

1047
00:57:14.981 --> 00:57:18.010
<v Speaker 3>and certainly in American government </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if America wanted something,</v>

1048
00:57:18.011 --> 00:57:20.590
<v Speaker 3>it must be doable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was very strong,</v>

1049
00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:23.170
<v Speaker 3>but of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you so rightly said,</v>

1050
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:28.810
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam went forward to destroying this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of my heroes in this book,</v>

1051
00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:33.850
<v Speaker 3>or boomer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a marine officer who might spend a lot </v>

1052
00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:34.210
<v Speaker 3>of time with and admired enormously </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't boomer,</v>

1053
00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:36.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

1054
00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:37.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said to me,</v>

1055
00:57:37.331 --> 00:57:40.300
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing you said in my lifetime,</v>

1056
00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:43.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has changed America more than Vietnam.</v>

1057
00:57:43.391 --> 00:57:48.391
<v Speaker 3>He said it created a mistrust and </v>
<v Speaker 3>suspicion of government and of the </v>

1058
00:57:49.271 --> 00:57:52.330
<v Speaker 3>people in charge that we've never been </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to undo.</v>

1059
00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:54.340
<v Speaker 3>And I think he's right about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you?</v>

1060
00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:57.810
<v Speaker 2>I think that's maybe one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>persistent things in the war,</v>

1061
00:57:57.811 --> 00:58:02.811
<v Speaker 2>that credibility gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's hard to describe to Americans </v>

1062
00:58:02.811 --> 00:58:03.560
<v Speaker 2>now how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you pointed out in your book,</v>

1063
00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:07.040
<v Speaker 2>Americans would believe their president </v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the time,</v>

1064
00:58:07.041 --> 00:58:11.540
<v Speaker 2>regardless of which he even was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's never been the same.</v>

1065
00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:13.040
<v Speaker 2>The other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you point out,</v>

1066
00:58:13.041 --> 00:58:15.770
<v Speaker 2>and as everyone knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not talked about enough that it</v>

1067
00:58:15.771 --> 00:58:20.771
<v Speaker 2>changed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it sort of because it was the second </v>

1068
00:58:20.771 --> 00:58:22.760
<v Speaker 2>major time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of codified the change,</v>

1069
00:58:22.761 --> 00:58:27.110
<v Speaker 2>the unspoken change in the US </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutional system where we no longer</v>

1070
00:58:27.111 --> 00:58:32.111
<v Speaker 2>declared war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could describe Korea as an outlier </v>

1071
00:58:32.111 --> 00:58:36.040
<v Speaker 2>if it was once upon a time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Vietnam becomes the time where we </v>

1072
00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:37.250
<v Speaker 2>sort of codified this and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested very much in,</v>

1073
00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:42.520
<v Speaker 2>in how you pointed out that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the legal advisor to the president was </v>

1074
00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:42.520
<v Speaker 2>explaining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1075
00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:44.240
<v Speaker 2>how you could get around having to </v>
<v Speaker 2>declare a war.</v>

1076
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:46.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was also very interested in the,</v>

1077
00:58:46.191 --> 00:58:51.191
<v Speaker 2>in the Munich question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fascinating to me how this </v>

1078
00:58:51.191 --> 00:58:53.870
<v Speaker 2>specter of appeasement and Munich was </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of hanging over the decision making</v>

1079
00:58:53.871 --> 00:58:58.871
<v Speaker 2>process and how it played into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>domestic politics and how it could </v>

1080
00:58:58.871 --> 00:59:01.040
<v Speaker 2>almost be used if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you compare it to a schoolyard brawl,</v>

1081
00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:03.800
<v Speaker 2>one side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calling the other a coward and demanding</v>

1082
00:59:03.801 --> 00:59:08.801
<v Speaker 2>they move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if moving wasn't the right </v>

1083
00:59:08.801 --> 00:59:08.801
<v Speaker 2>political choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1084
00:59:08.801 --> 00:59:13.090
<v Speaker 2>we still have the whole Munich </v>
<v Speaker 2>appeasement cudgel at work in today's </v>

1085
00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:17.471
<v Speaker 2>modern American politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you talk about that and the </v>

1086
00:59:17.471 --> 00:59:17.471
<v Speaker 2>credibility gap a little bit?</v>

1087
00:59:17.490 --> 00:59:20.920
<v Speaker 3>What was a big scene to be weak?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>

1088
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 3>it's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1089
00:59:22.161 --> 00:59:24.260
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the things I find as I </v>
<v Speaker 3>get older,</v>

1090
00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:29.680
<v Speaker 3>and I hope that one is a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>person from what I was when I was a </v>

1091
00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:32.120
<v Speaker 3>young reporter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I meant to tell you a terrible story.</v>

1092
00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:37.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in a household in which all </v>

1093
00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:40.391
<v Speaker 3>the men in the house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including my father banged on and on </v>

1094
00:59:40.391 --> 00:59:40.700
<v Speaker 3>about what a wonderful time they'd had </v>
<v Speaker 3>in world war two.</v>

1095
00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:46.090
<v Speaker 3>And I grew up believing with </v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary neighbor to the wars were </v>

1096
00:59:46.191 --> 00:59:51.191
<v Speaker 3>great adventures and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started out that way and I did the </v>

1097
00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:57.750
<v Speaker 3>parachutes with our own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our own people and all the restaurant </v>

1098
00:59:57.750 --> 01:00:00.340
<v Speaker 3>when I was 17.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I really thought that this was all </v>

1099
01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:03.290
<v Speaker 3>terrific romantic stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And really my whole life as a writer has</v>

1100
01:00:03.291 --> 01:00:06.590
<v Speaker 3>been a sort of journey of discovering </v>
<v Speaker 3>the walls are like that.</v>

1101
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:11.650
<v Speaker 3>That was a very serious stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a great phrase which I </v>

1102
01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:14.270
<v Speaker 3>sometimes quote to student audiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1103
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:19.690
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I suppose the lesson it's taken me 50 </v>

1104
01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:22.241
<v Speaker 3>years to learn was quoted by Norwegian </v>
<v Speaker 3>Resistance Shero called knute constant </v>

1105
01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.790
<v Speaker 3>knute Hanson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1106
01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:26.870
<v Speaker 3>after doing wonderful things with world </v>
<v Speaker 3>war two.</v>

1107
01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:30.920
<v Speaker 3>You raised memoirs in 1948.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in his book he wrote,</v>

1108
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:34.670
<v Speaker 3>although was bringing adventures that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stirred the heart,</v>

1109
01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:40.060
<v Speaker 3>the true nature of war is composed of </v>
<v Speaker 3>innumerable personal tragedies and </v>

1110
01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:43.520
<v Speaker 3>sacrifices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wholly evil are not redeemed by glory.</v>

1111
01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:49.300
<v Speaker 3>Now he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's absolutely right about </v>

1112
01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:49.300
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I find in my books these days,</v>

1113
01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:51.890
<v Speaker 3>I write far more about victims that I do</v>
<v Speaker 3>about soldiers.</v>

1114
01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:57.220
<v Speaker 3>But I think one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are many things that you do learn </v>

1115
01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:00.461
<v Speaker 3>to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sort of respect for the dilemmas </v>

1116
01:01:00.461 --> 01:01:03.671
<v Speaker 3>facing governments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That it's very difficult for all </v>

1117
01:01:03.671 --> 01:01:05.990
<v Speaker 3>governments at all times to decide when </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be strong and when to give way.</v>

1118
01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:10.770
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it used to seem so easy to just send the</v>

1119
01:01:10.771 --> 01:01:14.900
<v Speaker 3>hundred and first airborne all the US </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marine Corps to sort out your problems.</v>

1120
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.150
<v Speaker 3>What are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know it's not that simple,</v>

1121
01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:22.760
<v Speaker 3>but in the end if you can't sort out the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cultural issues in these countries,</v>

1122
01:01:22.810 --> 01:01:26.870
<v Speaker 3>the hundred and first airborne,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the US Marine Corps can't solve them</v>

1123
01:01:26.871 --> 01:01:30.740
<v Speaker 3>for you any more than our own army camp </v>
<v Speaker 3>and up.</v>

1124
01:01:30.741 --> 01:01:33.900
<v Speaker 3>But I think if one looks at history one </v>
<v Speaker 3>see moments,</v>

1125
01:01:33.901 --> 01:01:38.901
<v Speaker 3>I mean we can all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all see now that Kennedy was both </v>

1126
01:01:38.901 --> 01:01:42.791
<v Speaker 3>courageous and bold at the time of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the Cuban missile crisis,</v>

1127
01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:48.170
<v Speaker 3>which could have gone horribly wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes when presidents.</v>

1128
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:53.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm in Lyndon Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terribly wanted to be seen to be </v>

1129
01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.070
<v Speaker 3>courageous and to be doing the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing as the leader of the United States</v>

1130
01:01:55.790 --> 01:01:58.850
<v Speaker 3>by sending in troops to Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But of course you've got it wrong,</v>

1131
01:01:59.330 --> 01:02:00.590
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1132
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:03.590
<v Speaker 3>What I'd like to feel is that through my</v>
<v Speaker 3>own narratives,</v>

1133
01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:09.310
<v Speaker 3>one is all the time trying to realize </v>
<v Speaker 3>that governments are trying to do very </v>

1134
01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:12.491
<v Speaker 3>difficult things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't just mean in the United States </v>

1135
01:02:12.491 --> 01:02:15.071
<v Speaker 3>government in the context of Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most governments most of the time </v>

1136
01:02:15.071 --> 01:02:16.220
<v Speaker 3>and the same way for military </v>
<v Speaker 3>commanders.</v>

1137
01:02:16.221 --> 01:02:21.221
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen enough wars myself as a </v>

1138
01:02:21.221 --> 01:02:21.221
<v Speaker 3>reporter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one scene,</v>

1139
01:02:21.221 --> 01:02:22.500
<v Speaker 3>the not terrible things on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>battlefield,</v>

1140
01:02:22.501 --> 01:02:24.980
<v Speaker 3>but it is very difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1141
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000
<v Speaker 3>to fight wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is not as my father and his friends </v>

1142
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:30.000
<v Speaker 3>used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1143
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:30.940
<v Speaker 3>it's all a great wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1144
01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:33.330
<v Speaker 3>it's very tough out there on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>battlefield and,</v>

1145
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:36.090
<v Speaker 3>and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I find that at the age of 72,</v>

1146
01:02:36.091 --> 01:02:41.091
<v Speaker 3>I have a huge sympathy with the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who make the decisions that I didn't </v>

1147
01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:42.390
<v Speaker 3>have a when I was a stupid young kid.</v>

1148
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Everyone involved in the decision making</v>
<v Speaker 2>process of moving from a,</v>

1149
01:02:51.361 --> 01:02:56.361
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a more passive advisor role to putting </v>

1150
01:02:56.361 --> 01:02:56.361
<v Speaker 2>troops on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to quote you here.</v>

1151
01:02:56.361 --> 01:03:01.190
<v Speaker 2>You wrote quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none doubted that the war would be long </v>

1152
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:02.670
<v Speaker 2>and the cost immense quite unlike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

1153
01:03:02.671 --> 01:03:07.671
<v Speaker 2>to 2002 decision to invade Iraq in 1965,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every hazard was anticipated.</v>

1154
01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:10.980
<v Speaker 2>I not only found that an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>line,</v>

1155
01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:14.520
<v Speaker 2>I found that to be a new piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information for me.</v>

1156
01:03:14.521 --> 01:03:16.410
<v Speaker 2>And I've read quite a few books on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vietnam,</v>

1157
01:03:16.411 --> 01:03:17.900
<v Speaker 2>but it's been a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1158
01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:21.690
<v Speaker 2>and that was something that I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed my paradigm a little.</v>

1159
01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:26.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you explain that because it is </v>

1160
01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:26.940
<v Speaker 2>interesting to think you would commit </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually half a million troops and,</v>

1161
01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:31.970
<v Speaker 2>and yet understand how it might not even</v>
<v Speaker 2>be winnable and understand how tough </v>

1162
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:33.840
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a and not understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

1163
01:03:33.841 --> 01:03:36.930
<v Speaker 2>the difference between Asian communism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Soviet communism.</v>

1164
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you talk about that a little bit?</v>

1165
01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:47.290
<v Speaker 3>Not in the Johnson White House State </v>
<v Speaker 3>Department is Memoranda on the things </v>

1166
01:03:51.550 --> 01:03:53.470
<v Speaker 3>you said in conversations with the White</v>
<v Speaker 3>House,</v>

1167
01:03:53.471 --> 01:03:58.471
<v Speaker 3>with the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wound all along as in thethe does </v>

1168
01:03:58.471 --> 01:03:58.960
<v Speaker 3>some of the generals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1169
01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:02.320
<v Speaker 3>that they didn't think that a jungle war</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1170
01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:07.530
<v Speaker 3>in the swamps of the mountains of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam was going to be the kind that </v>

1171
01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:08.900
<v Speaker 3>suited the US army.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1172
01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1173
01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:15.400
<v Speaker 3>one of the problems I'm afraid we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>already prone to is that we can be </v>

1174
01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:19.621
<v Speaker 3>terribly impressed by how my trn forces </v>
<v Speaker 3>look that if you see I'm a US carrier </v>

1175
01:04:20.891 --> 01:04:25.891
<v Speaker 3>group at sea and if you see a always </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrific on jets taking off from the </v>

1176
01:04:25.891 --> 01:04:30.690
<v Speaker 3>flight decks and if you see your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your marines storming through the surf,</v>

1177
01:04:30.761 --> 01:04:35.761
<v Speaker 3>and so they all look so impressive that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't believe anything can stand up </v>

1178
01:04:35.761 --> 01:04:36.670
<v Speaker 3>to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the word people,</v>

1179
01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:42.030
<v Speaker 3>smart people in positions of influence </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the sixties who did clearly identify </v>

1180
01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:47.700
<v Speaker 3>the fact that this was going to be very </v>
<v Speaker 3>tough and that kind of war in the jungle</v>

1181
01:04:48.341 --> 01:04:51.010
<v Speaker 3>against guerrillas might well not suit </v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans.</v>

1182
01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things a lot of people George</v>

1183
01:04:53.830 --> 01:04:55.960
<v Speaker 3>Ball said very smartly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

1184
01:04:55.961 --> 01:04:56.710
<v Speaker 3>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 3>President,</v>

1185
01:04:57.070 --> 01:04:59.080
<v Speaker 3>if I thought this could be done in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

1186
01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:00.850
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went back through all the way,</v>

1187
01:05:00.851 --> 01:05:02.740
<v Speaker 3>but he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to take much longer,</v>

1188
01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.370
<v Speaker 3>and I do not believe that the American </v>
<v Speaker 3>people will have the patients for a long</v>

1189
01:05:06.371 --> 01:05:11.371
<v Speaker 3>walk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the key things is </v>

1190
01:05:11.371 --> 01:05:13.620
<v Speaker 3>democracies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Light was to be over quick and I always </v>

1191
01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:15.930
<v Speaker 3>say it's sort of half amuses me that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike,</v>

1192
01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:18.350
<v Speaker 3>the last job I did a as a war </v>
<v Speaker 3>correspondent,</v>

1193
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:23.460
<v Speaker 3>I reported the British Falklands War and</v>
<v Speaker 3>no to the British love the Falklands War</v>

1194
01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:29.080
<v Speaker 3>because we had an incredibly incompetent</v>
<v Speaker 3>enemy in the eyes and tight army and it </v>

1195
01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.560
<v Speaker 3>was all over very quickly and we won.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1196
01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.160
<v Speaker 3>and that's the sort of war everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants,</v>

1197
01:05:33.161 --> 01:05:35.470
<v Speaker 3>but unfortunately it's not the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>war you will get.</v>

1198
01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now I am impressed,</v>

1199
01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:43.351
<v Speaker 3>but the number of smart people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them in uniform who clearly saw </v>

1200
01:05:43.351 --> 01:05:44.230
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the problems facing chiefs of</v>

1201
01:05:44.231 --> 01:05:49.231
<v Speaker 3>staff and that was true now and that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>your a political leader,</v>

1202
01:05:49.511 --> 01:05:53.140
<v Speaker 3>your president or prime minister says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you do this?</v>

1203
01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:56.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>senior generals and admirals and an Ama,</v>

1204
01:05:57.130 --> 01:06:00.850
<v Speaker 3>they know they've got to justify this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stupendous costs of the armed forces.</v>

1205
01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:05.650
<v Speaker 3>And you've got to be quite a brave man </v>
<v Speaker 3>to tell your head of state or your,</v>

1206
01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.880
<v Speaker 3>your chief executive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1207
01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:11.110
<v Speaker 3>that your forces can't do this or that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in.</v>

1208
01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:16.170
<v Speaker 3>I remember being amused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a 2002 just before the invasion of </v>

1209
01:06:16.170 --> 01:06:20.941
<v Speaker 3>Iraq and I was friendly with our then </v>
<v Speaker 3>head of the army and I met him one day </v>

1210
01:06:20.941 --> 01:06:22.720
<v Speaker 3>when you just come back from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm from Washington,</v>

1211
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:25.540
<v Speaker 3>we've been at a planning meeting for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>invasion of Iraq.</v>

1212
01:06:26.110 --> 01:06:27.820
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1213
01:06:27.821 --> 01:06:29.740
<v Speaker 3>what do you make of?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1214
01:06:29.741 --> 01:06:34.741
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said getting into Baghdad it's going </v>

1215
01:06:34.741 --> 01:06:36.440
<v Speaker 3>to be dead easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he said that in the slightest idea </v>

1216
01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:36.440
<v Speaker 3>what they're going to do when they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1217
01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at that time,</v>

1218
01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:40.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that to um,</v>

1219
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.980
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1220
01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:47.080
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people making the decisions in </v>

1221
01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:47.080
<v Speaker 3>Washington didn't seem too much of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

1222
01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.780
<v Speaker 3>But I'm the worst smart people back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>64,</v>

1223
01:06:49.781 --> 01:06:53.980
<v Speaker 3>65 who did see that this was going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very tough road to hoe.</v>

1224
01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:55.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but so,</v>

1225
01:06:56.650 --> 01:06:59.530
<v Speaker 3>but the people to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1226
01:06:59.531 --> 01:07:04.531
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was always mixed up between horror at </v>

1227
01:07:04.531 --> 01:07:07.120
<v Speaker 3>some of the stupid people who did bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>things both in uniform and out of it.</v>

1228
01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:09.750
<v Speaker 3>And also admiration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1229
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:15.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm in some of the soldiers and some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Marines on some of the abstinence </v>

1230
01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.590
<v Speaker 3>song within the framework of a disaster.</v>

1231
01:07:17.890 --> 01:07:22.890
<v Speaker 3>They did very fine things and I find </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself still admiring hugely what they </v>

1232
01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:24.730
<v Speaker 3>achieved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An alright.</v>

1233
01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:26.650
<v Speaker 3>You may say you're going to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

1234
01:07:26.651 --> 01:07:27.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was all for nothing.</v>

1235
01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:31.160
<v Speaker 3>But mind you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to say one story that sticks very</v>

1236
01:07:31.170 --> 01:07:36.170
<v Speaker 3>much in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the most impressive people I </v>

1237
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:39.151
<v Speaker 3>interviewed was a former corpsman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a medic with the infantry guy called </v>

1238
01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:44.221
<v Speaker 3>David Rogers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a David Rogers described being very </v>

1239
01:07:44.221 --> 01:07:48.241
<v Speaker 3>movingly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His experiences with his platoon of who </v>

1240
01:07:48.241 --> 01:07:52.381
<v Speaker 3>we said about a third were killed or </v>
<v Speaker 3>wounded up north of Saigon in about 69 </v>

1241
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.840
<v Speaker 3>70.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1242
01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:56.560
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1243
01:07:56.561 --> 01:08:00.730
<v Speaker 3>he was very emotionally affected by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>war and remain so.</v>

1244
01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:04.270
<v Speaker 3>But he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in 1993.</v>

1245
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:09.870
<v Speaker 3>He was one of those who have the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnamese invited back as a guest to </v>

1246
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:14.821
<v Speaker 3>come and visit the country again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he went as a reporter and he said </v>

1247
01:08:14.821 --> 01:08:19.180
<v Speaker 3>they took him to the area where he'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>fought with his unit and he said all the</v>

1248
01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Viet Cong embraced him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1249
01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:25.810
<v Speaker 3>because they rolled under strict orders </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be incredibly nice to Americans </v>

1250
01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:26.720
<v Speaker 3>because they wanted Congress to pass a </v>
<v Speaker 3>trade deal on.</v>

1251
01:08:26.721 --> 01:08:29.360
<v Speaker 3>David Rogers said to me what I had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Redo a couple of years ago.</v>

1252
01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:34.660
<v Speaker 3>He said I couldn't help thinking they've</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these guys while he was a </v>

1253
01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:37.800
<v Speaker 3>Mcdonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't we have sorted this out a long </v>

1254
01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:37.800
<v Speaker 3>time ago?</v>

1255
01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:42.520
<v Speaker 2>Johnson was offering if they would just </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop infiltrating the south.</v>

1256
01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:45.750
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you something that's a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>close to home.</v>

1257
01:08:45.751 --> 01:08:50.751
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I want to talk about the media </v>
<v Speaker 2>coverage because this proverbially the </v>

1258
01:08:50.751 --> 01:08:53.490
<v Speaker 2>war that was lost in America's living </v>
<v Speaker 2>rooms and all that kind of stuff.</v>

1259
01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.460
<v Speaker 2>I've found some of the things you said </v>
<v Speaker 2>very interesting.</v>

1260
01:08:56.461 --> 01:08:57.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1261
01:08:57.181 --> 01:08:59.460
<v Speaker 2>you brought up a point that had never </v>
<v Speaker 2>occurred to me.</v>

1262
01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm quoting here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1263
01:09:01.111 --> 01:09:02.630
<v Speaker 2>or close to it that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1264
01:09:02.670 --> 01:09:07.670
<v Speaker 2>that Vietnam war era reporters enjoyed a</v>
<v Speaker 2>notable advantage over most of their </v>

1265
01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:12.141
<v Speaker 2>successors in the 21st century because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they themselves at often served in </v>

1266
01:09:12.141 --> 01:09:15.330
<v Speaker 2>uniform and we're familiar with weapons </v>
<v Speaker 2>and military ways.</v>

1267
01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:16.520
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1268
01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1269
01:09:17.051 --> 01:09:22.051
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing that I found </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting was when you talked about </v>

1270
01:09:22.051 --> 01:09:25.380
<v Speaker 2>the line that some Americans went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their graves believing that reporters </v>

1271
01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:29.581
<v Speaker 2>betrayed their country while winning </v>
<v Speaker 2>applaudance from the media counterparts </v>

1272
01:09:29.581 --> 01:09:30.590
<v Speaker 2>around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1273
01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:32.440
<v Speaker 2>can you talk a little bit about media </v>
<v Speaker 2>coverage?</v>

1274
01:09:32.441 --> 01:09:33.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1275
01:09:33.161 --> 01:09:35.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we've seen because before </v>
<v Speaker 2>that war,</v>

1276
01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:38.560
<v Speaker 2>the war coverage was very censored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>world war type stuff.</v>

1277
01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:41.950
<v Speaker 2>And yet somehow after that war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've toned down.</v>

1278
01:09:41.951 --> 01:09:46.951
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we have embedded reporters who are </v>

1279
01:09:46.951 --> 01:09:46.951
<v Speaker 2>essentially working with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>governments.</v>

1280
01:09:46.951 --> 01:09:49.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we've ever seen the kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of freedom to show news the way they did</v>

1281
01:09:49.631 --> 01:09:54.631
<v Speaker 2>in that war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do you think that was a good thing </v>

1282
01:09:54.631 --> 01:09:57.511
<v Speaker 2>or a bad thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do you think the reporters at the </v>

1283
01:09:57.511 --> 01:09:57.511
<v Speaker 2>time did a good enough job pointing out </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you mentioned,</v>

1284
01:09:57.511 --> 01:10:01.180
<v Speaker 2>the other side's transgressions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>atrocities and everything so that things</v>

1285
01:10:01.181 --> 01:10:02.350
<v Speaker 2>would be equal a little bit</v>

1286
01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:09.360
<v Speaker 3>in the introduction to my book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think many of the reporters who served </v>

1287
01:10:09.701 --> 01:10:14.701
<v Speaker 3>in Vietnam did not standing job of </v>
<v Speaker 3>reporting entirely accurately what they </v>

1288
01:10:14.701 --> 01:10:19.321
<v Speaker 3>themselves saw and knew where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>failed was because it was so much going </v>

1289
01:10:19.391 --> 01:10:21.880
<v Speaker 3>on on the other side that they had no </v>
<v Speaker 3>access to,</v>

1290
01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:27.410
<v Speaker 3>but I'm an incredibly bad stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the other side was doing never got </v>

1291
01:10:27.911 --> 01:10:32.911
<v Speaker 3>any sort of show and I quite understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a very small way I was party to it </v>

1292
01:10:32.911 --> 01:10:37.381
<v Speaker 3>myself because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was reporting for BBC and </v>

1293
01:10:37.381 --> 01:10:41.260
<v Speaker 3>newspapers in the early seventies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time you were seeing shocking </v>

1294
01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:46.201
<v Speaker 3>stuff been going on all around you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were witness to the corruption on </v>

1295
01:10:46.201 --> 01:10:47.590
<v Speaker 3>the incompetence of the South Vietnamese</v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

1296
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:53.110
<v Speaker 3>But we just didn't pay enough attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>to this stuff we couldn't see and the </v>

1297
01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:58.200
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas it was absolutely true that </v>

1298
01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:58.700
<v Speaker 3>there was a huge credibility gap because</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the stuff that was a,</v>

1299
01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.330
<v Speaker 3>we were told that briefings and solve </v>
<v Speaker 3>with absolute garbage,</v>

1300
01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:03.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the numbers,</v>

1301
01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.900
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>body counts and so on.</v>

1302
01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.210
<v Speaker 3>The frightful lies were told in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boomer,</v>

1303
01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:14.220
<v Speaker 3>the General Marine Corps general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said to me that one of the </v>

1304
01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:14.790
<v Speaker 3>lessons he brought home from three tours</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Vietnam was telling the truth.</v>

1305
01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.360
<v Speaker 3>But the curious thing that the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>contradiction on the one hand a lot of </v>

1306
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:25.320
<v Speaker 3>senior Americans did not tell the truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the world about what was happening.</v>

1307
01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:31.120
<v Speaker 3>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>America dippers have a commitment that </v>

1308
01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.450
<v Speaker 3>was very honorable to let us see for </v>
<v Speaker 3>ourselves.</v>

1309
01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:37.260
<v Speaker 3>So that in a way that's never been </v>
<v Speaker 3>repeated in any war sense.</v>

1310
01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:42.710
<v Speaker 3>That if any of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort of didn't believe what we were </v>

1311
01:11:42.710 --> 01:11:45.651
<v Speaker 3>being told about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some bell going off in the middle of </v>

1312
01:11:45.651 --> 01:11:48.200
<v Speaker 3>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could get access on me as a British </v>

1313
01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:51.351
<v Speaker 3>journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as much as anybody on fixed wing </v>

1314
01:11:51.351 --> 01:11:53.871
<v Speaker 3>aircraft and helicopters to go there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>look for ourselves and the Communists </v>

1315
01:11:53.871 --> 01:11:57.480
<v Speaker 3>would never let anybody but Jane Fonda </v>
<v Speaker 3>go up and see what the hell was going on</v>

1316
01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:58.680
<v Speaker 3>in that neck of the woods.</v>

1317
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I do not believe that the business,</v>

1318
01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:06.330
<v Speaker 3>the media lost the war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I certainly do believe that,</v>

1319
01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:11.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way the war was covered up made it </v>

1320
01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:13.070
<v Speaker 3>more difficult for the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1321
01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a point,</v>

1322
01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:19.370
<v Speaker 3>my father was a war correspondent in </v>
<v Speaker 3>world war two and I once said to him </v>

1323
01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:21.610
<v Speaker 3>that having been reading some of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>wartime dispatchers,</v>

1324
01:12:21.611 --> 01:12:26.611
<v Speaker 3>they seem to be pretty gung Ho.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said what we were doing as part </v>

1325
01:12:26.611 --> 01:12:26.611
<v Speaker 3>of the war effort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1326
01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:31.640
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nearly all the senior officers who were </v>

1327
01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:31.640
<v Speaker 3>in Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>American senior officers,</v>

1328
01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:36.140
<v Speaker 3>they'd been in world war two and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were accustomed to dealing with the </v>

1329
01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:39.111
<v Speaker 3>media that would play the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in what was seen to be in the </v>

1330
01:12:39.111 --> 01:12:39.870
<v Speaker 3>national interest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wouldn't break ranks.</v>

1331
01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:44.370
<v Speaker 3>And now suddenly in Vietnam they find </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you've got a whole lot of reporters</v>

1332
01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:49.200
<v Speaker 3>refused to accept that I'm telling the </v>
<v Speaker 3>story the way that Mac v is,</v>

1333
01:12:49.210 --> 01:12:51.890
<v Speaker 3>they've always known of one of the toll </v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

1334
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:56.990
<v Speaker 3>was not going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they found it very difficult to </v>

1335
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:56.990
<v Speaker 3>adjust to this.</v>

1336
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:58.920
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think what is also fair,</v>

1337
01:12:58.921 --> 01:13:03.921
<v Speaker 3>but some John,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this I think it would be dishonest </v>

1338
01:13:03.921 --> 01:13:03.921
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was taking apart the television</v>

1339
01:13:03.921 --> 01:13:08.841
<v Speaker 3>discussion a year or so ago with a group</v>
<v Speaker 3>of former war correspondents,</v>

1340
01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:14.360
<v Speaker 3>including some Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said they were talking about their</v>

1341
01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:18.000
<v Speaker 3>commitment to tell the truth and tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world what was going on.</v>

1342
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:21.780
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't we also met that when you're,</v>

1343
01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:23.900
<v Speaker 3>when you're as young as we all were and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so on.</v>

1344
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:27.150
<v Speaker 3>It was a great adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we had the time of our lives in many</v>

1345
01:13:27.151 --> 01:13:29.030
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were all responsible kids.</v>

1346
01:13:29.370 --> 01:13:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of the others would admit that at </v>

1347
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:34.370
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1348
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:34.370
<v Speaker 3>they got very angry with me for saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1349
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:38.780
<v Speaker 3>But I'm afraid the were in Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the journalists were frankly,</v>

1350
01:13:38.971 --> 01:13:41.520
<v Speaker 3>what I would call war tourists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1351
01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:46.940
<v Speaker 3>there was some brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>serious minded super people like Neil </v>

1352
01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:46.940
<v Speaker 3>CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 3>David Halberstam,</v>

1353
01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:51.821
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there were some very fine </v>

1354
01:13:51.821 --> 01:13:51.821
<v Speaker 3>correspondence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm in,</v>

1355
01:13:51.821 --> 01:13:53.850
<v Speaker 3>it was a great life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were unlimited girls drugs,</v>

1356
01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:57.270
<v Speaker 3>delicious food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful country and all rest of it.</v>

1357
01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:01.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and although some of the media,</v>

1358
01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:03.560
<v Speaker 3>how they find this in Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1359
01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:06.510
<v Speaker 3>I would also say that some of the media </v>
<v Speaker 3>had the unfinished style,</v>

1360
01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:11.440
<v Speaker 3>like the television crew that provided a</v>
<v Speaker 3>knife for a soldier to cut the ears off,</v>

1361
01:14:11.441 --> 01:14:13.780
<v Speaker 3>some dead Viet Cong on camera and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of stuff.</v>

1362
01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.100
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1363
01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:18.340
<v Speaker 3>the media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his record in Vietnam was pretty mixed.</v>

1364
01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:23.660
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was some stuff we're proud open </v>

1365
01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:23.660
<v Speaker 3>some stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>frankly the same dog</v>

1366
01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:32.630
<v Speaker 2>in terms of protests and everything else</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's interesting as a kid </v>

1367
01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:36.491
<v Speaker 2>growing up in the post Vietnam era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought that was the new reality </v>

1368
01:14:36.491 --> 01:14:38.480
<v Speaker 2>that would be expected in future </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflicts.</v>

1369
01:14:38.481 --> 01:14:41.120
<v Speaker 2>And yet now looking 50 years back on </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1370
01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.970
<v Speaker 2>if you really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you start in the second world war,</v>

1371
01:14:44.210 --> 01:14:48.170
<v Speaker 2>there's very little of that large spike </v>
<v Speaker 2>in anti war activity.</v>

1372
01:14:48.171 --> 01:14:53.171
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only were there no protesters </v>

1373
01:14:53.171 --> 01:14:53.171
<v Speaker 2>protesting the bombing of Germany and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan,</v>

1374
01:14:53.171 --> 01:14:57.760
<v Speaker 2>but they're really by 1960 standards </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't that much after the Vietnam War </v>

1375
01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:01.841
<v Speaker 2>for any of the conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think accounts for that </v>

1376
01:15:01.841 --> 01:15:01.910
<v Speaker 2>being such an outlier situation?</v>

1377
01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:06.430
<v Speaker 3>I've suggested in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was living here in the late</v>

1378
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:08.460
<v Speaker 3>sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I saw it,</v>

1379
01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:14.280
<v Speaker 3>the demonstrations and the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but all sorts of stuff got tangled up </v>

1380
01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:18.101
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the worldwide youth movement </v>

1381
01:15:18.101 --> 01:15:21.781
<v Speaker 3>against the established order on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolt against the old sexual morality </v>

1382
01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:28.300
<v Speaker 3>and the enthusiasm of a part of the and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all this stuff got rolled up with </v>

1383
01:15:28.701 --> 01:15:29.790
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1384
01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:35.320
<v Speaker 3>and you've got to remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids in those days were putting posters </v>

1385
01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.540
<v Speaker 3>on their college walls or we Tang who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody who knows anything knows was one</v>

1386
01:15:38.541 --> 01:15:41.480
<v Speaker 3>of the great mass murderers of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 3>century up there with,</v>

1387
01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:43.370
<v Speaker 3>with Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1388
01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:44.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the walls,</v>

1389
01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:49.150
<v Speaker 3>incredible naivety among the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The kids were right about one thing,</v>

1390
01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:54.170
<v Speaker 3>the war was a disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but of course one of the things that </v>

1391
01:15:54.170 --> 01:15:57.100
<v Speaker 3>drove the protest movement was the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that a lot of them were terrified of </v>

1392
01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:57.140
<v Speaker 3>being drafted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1393
01:15:57.300 --> 01:16:02.300
<v Speaker 3>that they were afraid they were going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to waste two years of their lives </v>

1394
01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:03.800
<v Speaker 3>in uniform and maybe lose their lives </v>
<v Speaker 3>all together.</v>

1395
01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:09.220
<v Speaker 3>So I'm mixed up with the principle </v>
<v Speaker 3>objections to the war and mixed up with </v>

1396
01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:13.040
<v Speaker 3>the whole youth revolt was they felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>they had skin in the game about,</v>

1397
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:17.960
<v Speaker 3>about the danger to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were,</v>

1398
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:20.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was an extraordinary time to be here.</v>

1399
01:16:20.061 --> 01:16:22.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the stuff that I saw myself,</v>

1400
01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:27.540
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was you actually felt America was </v>

1401
01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:28.280
<v Speaker 3>falling apart in 1968.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in fact,</v>

1402
01:16:28.281 --> 01:16:33.281
<v Speaker 3>the fact that it didn't fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never gone to a bank of America </v>

1403
01:16:33.281 --> 01:16:33.281
<v Speaker 3>ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One's always,</v>

1404
01:16:33.281 --> 01:16:37.961
<v Speaker 3>I always believed passionate this day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And America is capacity of reinvention </v>

1405
01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:41.890
<v Speaker 3>because I saw what a mess it could get </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself into it in [inaudible] 68 and </v>

1406
01:16:41.890 --> 01:16:43.880
<v Speaker 3>come out the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no subsequent war.</v>

1407
01:16:43.881 --> 01:16:48.881
<v Speaker 3>The other thing we must remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing was much smaller and we </v>

1408
01:16:48.881 --> 01:16:52.371
<v Speaker 3>probably talked too much in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation about all the battlefields </v>

1409
01:16:52.371 --> 01:16:54.320
<v Speaker 3>stuff and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at casualties,</v>

1410
01:16:54.321 --> 01:16:59.321
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've written about one battle in </v>
<v Speaker 3>one chapter of my book called Dido that </v>

1411
01:16:59.321 --> 01:17:03.500
<v Speaker 3>absolute nobody's ever heard of and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a three day battle in May,</v>

1412
01:17:03.501 --> 01:17:06.170
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>68 in which are marine battalion.</v>

1413
01:17:06.170 --> 01:17:11.170
<v Speaker 3>It was more or less wiped out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up near the demilitarized in three days </v>

1414
01:17:11.170 --> 01:17:15.491
<v Speaker 3>of bottling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they lost 81 killed and I forget </v>

1415
01:17:15.491 --> 01:17:18.700
<v Speaker 3>about 250 wounded and they ended up with</v>
<v Speaker 3>one on wounded officer and I'm about 150</v>

1416
01:17:20.631 --> 01:17:25.631
<v Speaker 3>men still fit for combat and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 3>remotely like that happened in Iraq or </v>

1417
01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:28.880
<v Speaker 3>in Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1418
01:17:28.881 --> 01:17:30.600
<v Speaker 3>the scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was a,</v>

1419
01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:35.570
<v Speaker 3>a really murderous bloody business in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some of the stuff people did and some</v>

1420
01:17:35.571 --> 01:17:37.800
<v Speaker 3>of the stuff people experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1421
01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:39.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1422
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:43.130
<v Speaker 3>it was as bad as well too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or career at times.</v>

1423
01:17:43.131 --> 01:17:44.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1424
01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:48.590
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't buy the line that Vietnam is the</v>

1425
01:17:48.591 --> 01:17:51.230
<v Speaker 3>worst world that ever was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in all wars are pretty ghastly,</v>

1426
01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:53.510
<v Speaker 3>but it was a hell of a lot worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1427
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:58.870
<v Speaker 3>in the scale of the bloodbath than </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything remotely in Afghanistan or Iraq</v>

1428
01:17:59.510 --> 01:18:04.510
<v Speaker 3>and these are volunteer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been fought by volunteer </v>

1429
01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:04.510
<v Speaker 3>soldiers</v>

1430
01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:12.140
<v Speaker 2>magazine killed that week and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the casualty levels could get high </v>

1431
01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:13.470
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundreds a week.</v>

1432
01:18:13.690 --> 01:18:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Then I would say.</v>

1433
01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:20.640
<v Speaker 2>And I was trying to figure out how we </v>
<v Speaker 2>would react today in the United States </v>

1434
01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:20.640
<v Speaker 2>to casualty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1435
01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:22.790
<v Speaker 2>and that brings me back to something you</v>
<v Speaker 2>had talked about,</v>

1436
01:18:22.791 --> 01:18:26.360
<v Speaker 2>the war being a disaster and then we had</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about the protesters in the media</v>

1437
01:18:26.361 --> 01:18:28.580
<v Speaker 2>and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does make me wonder though,</v>

1438
01:18:28.581 --> 01:18:32.810
<v Speaker 2>what is the responsibility if your </v>
<v Speaker 2>government seems on a course to continue</v>

1439
01:18:32.811 --> 01:18:37.811
<v Speaker 2>doubling down on something that everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows is a disaster in a democratic or </v>

1440
01:18:37.811 --> 01:18:42.551
<v Speaker 2>republican system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the role of the population in </v>

1441
01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.210
<v Speaker 2>terms of checking a government that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

1442
01:18:44.211 --> 01:18:49.211
<v Speaker 2>didn't know what they were getting into </v>
<v Speaker 2>or didn't know what they were getting </v>

1443
01:18:49.211 --> 01:18:49.211
<v Speaker 2>into but found no way out of where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were going.</v>

1444
01:18:49.211 --> 01:18:53.921
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could one make the case that it was </v>

1445
01:18:53.921 --> 01:18:56.471
<v Speaker 2>better to have that kind of pressure on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the part of the electorate versus what </v>

1446
01:18:56.471 --> 01:18:57.710
<v Speaker 2>might have happened if that pressure had</v>
<v Speaker 2>not been there?</v>

1447
01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:03.140
<v Speaker 3>What I was living in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see a lot of Americans,</v>

1448
01:19:03.961 --> 01:19:06.780
<v Speaker 3>especially in middle America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Middle America,</v>

1449
01:19:06.781 --> 01:19:10.950
<v Speaker 3>very well in that era in Minnesota and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Wisconsin.</v>

1450
01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:16.730
<v Speaker 3>And you saw very patriotic Americans </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrestling with the dilemma of,</v>

1451
01:19:16.731 --> 01:19:17.970
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loyalty.</v>

1452
01:19:17.971 --> 01:19:22.971
<v Speaker 3>Les,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you just blindly go on supporting </v>

1453
01:19:22.971 --> 01:19:22.971
<v Speaker 3>your president or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or did you not?</v>

1454
01:19:22.971 --> 01:19:25.290
<v Speaker 3>They weren't to kind of go out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>protest in the streets,</v>

1455
01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:30.270
<v Speaker 3>but it's a very difficult issue and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think it is right.</v>

1456
01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:31.500
<v Speaker 3>Just speak up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1457
01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:36.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's never easy to decide where the </v>

1458
01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:39.351
<v Speaker 3>patriotic root lies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember one of the most moving </v>

1459
01:19:39.351 --> 01:19:39.351
<v Speaker 3>things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that happened to me,</v>

1460
01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:44.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was there in 71 and I've been up </v>

1461
01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:47.070
<v Speaker 3>reporting for BBC of Battle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>playschool Farber's six up in the,</v>

1462
01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:48.390
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1463
01:19:48.391 --> 01:19:53.391
<v Speaker 3>the border hell of a murderous business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we hitched a ride back.</v>

1464
01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:55.780
<v Speaker 3>Saigon on a c 1:30.</v>

1465
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:57.680
<v Speaker 3>That was only one other camera crew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wally,</v>

1466
01:19:57.710 --> 01:20:02.710
<v Speaker 3>he was so in the cargo hold of this huge</v>
<v Speaker 3>aircraft on down at the end of the plane</v>

1467
01:20:03.450 --> 01:20:06.780
<v Speaker 3>or the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then from us was the body bag,</v>

1468
01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:09.860
<v Speaker 3>an American sergeants and advisor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1469
01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000
<v Speaker 3>who have been killed in the battle and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's his body bag with all his stuff </v>

1470
01:20:15.091 --> 01:20:20.091
<v Speaker 3>around him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his guitar and the sound system on all </v>

1471
01:20:20.091 --> 01:20:20.091
<v Speaker 3>these kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so on.</v>

1472
01:20:20.091 --> 01:20:24.720
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had an hour and a half or two hours </v>

1473
01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:25.770
<v Speaker 3>on the plane down to Saigon looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was sort of looking at this,</v>

1474
01:20:26.230 --> 01:20:27.890
<v Speaker 3>that poor bastard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1475
01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:29.640
<v Speaker 3>he's an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a body bag and so on.</v>

1476
01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:35.060
<v Speaker 3>And I thought we're now in a situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>where nobody wants to be the last </v>

1477
01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:36.570
<v Speaker 3>American to die in a war that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously lost.</v>

1478
01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:42.140
<v Speaker 3>And I think one of the things that one </v>
<v Speaker 3>does bitterly reproached Nixon and </v>

1479
01:20:42.140 --> 01:20:44.790
<v Speaker 3>Kissinger for from the moment they </v>
<v Speaker 3>assumed office in [inaudible] 69.</v>

1480
01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:47.190
<v Speaker 3>They knew there was no hope of winning </v>
<v Speaker 3>the war,</v>

1481
01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:49.950
<v Speaker 3>but they were desperate for purely </v>
<v Speaker 3>political reasons,</v>

1482
01:20:49.951 --> 01:20:54.951
<v Speaker 3>to conceal from the American people </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the war was lost and 22,000</v>

1483
01:20:55.111 --> 01:21:00.111
<v Speaker 3>Americans died under the Nixon </v>
<v Speaker 3>presidency and I'm Vietnamese and it was</v>

1484
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:06.140
<v Speaker 3>in many ways the worst period because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got the whole black power thing.</v>

1485
01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.700
<v Speaker 3>You've got the army in Vietnam falling </v>
<v Speaker 3>apart,</v>

1486
01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:12.420
<v Speaker 3>a huge drug problems and so on and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth and all this.</v>

1487
01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:17.780
<v Speaker 3>They knew all the way down the street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no way they were going to win </v>

1488
01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:21.531
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were just desperate to avoid </v>

1489
01:21:21.531 --> 01:21:21.930
<v Speaker 3>anybody finding out about this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to me,</v>

1490
01:21:21.931 --> 01:21:26.931
<v Speaker 3>one of the grizzlies bits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the White House tapes were relatively </v>

1491
01:21:26.931 --> 01:21:30.141
<v Speaker 3>recently released in 2015 is a kissinger</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming back from the secret Paris peace </v>

1492
01:21:30.571 --> 01:21:35.571
<v Speaker 3>talks in October 72 and he rushes into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the of the Oval Office and he says,</v>

1493
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:37.200
<v Speaker 3>next.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>

1494
01:21:37.201 --> 01:21:37.380
<v Speaker 3>Mr.</v>

1495
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:42.470
<v Speaker 3>President,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have got a better deal than you have </v>

1496
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:43.170
<v Speaker 3>ever dreamed on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And remember,</v>

1497
01:21:43.171 --> 01:21:48.171
<v Speaker 3>this is a month before Nixon faces </v>
<v Speaker 3>George Mcgovern in the presidential </v>

1498
01:21:48.171 --> 01:21:52.110
<v Speaker 3>election and Kissinger doesn't say this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to bring peace.</v>

1499
01:21:52.111 --> 01:21:55.680
<v Speaker 3>There's going to save countless lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said this will absolutely,</v>

1500
01:21:55.681 --> 01:22:00.120
<v Speaker 3>totally screwed mcgough and the cynicism</v>
<v Speaker 3>of these guys at this stage,</v>

1501
01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:03.520
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was all about politics and,</v>

1502
01:22:03.521 --> 01:22:05.260
<v Speaker 3>and that's a pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1503
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.930
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1504
01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.850
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sticks in your crawl,</v>

1505
01:22:07.851 --> 01:22:10.140
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But actually one thing I would say,</v>

1506
01:22:10.141 --> 01:22:13.230
<v Speaker 3>which I think is important as a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>closing note on this,</v>

1507
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:15.390
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the supreme irony of the war,</v>

1508
01:22:16.050 --> 01:22:18.100
<v Speaker 3>if you go to Vietnam today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1509
01:22:18.810 --> 01:22:21.150
<v Speaker 3>if you'd said to an American and about </v>
<v Speaker 3>66,</v>

1510
01:22:21.330 --> 01:22:23.970
<v Speaker 3>how would you like Saigon to look in </v>
<v Speaker 3>2018?</v>

1511
01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:29.230
<v Speaker 3>We'll actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be pretty much the way it looks </v>

1512
01:22:29.230 --> 01:22:30.831
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And although it's still a very </v>

1513
01:22:30.831 --> 01:22:33.570
<v Speaker 3>unpleasant totalitarian state vet now </v>
<v Speaker 3>they do now have license to make money.</v>

1514
01:22:33.570 --> 01:22:38.570
<v Speaker 3>They want to be Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're incredibly nice to Americans </v>

1515
01:22:38.570 --> 01:22:39.360
<v Speaker 3>because they realize that the American </v>
<v Speaker 3>system is,</v>

1516
01:22:39.730 --> 01:22:44.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>worth countless more valuable and can't </v>

1517
01:22:44.730 --> 01:22:45.990
<v Speaker 3>this a more valid than their own Richard</v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

1518
01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:51.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're all completely hooked on </v>

1519
01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:55.520
<v Speaker 3>American culture and on making money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've suggested in the last chapter </v>

1520
01:22:56.131 --> 01:22:59.940
<v Speaker 3>of my book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United States failed in Vietnam,</v>

1521
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:05.270
<v Speaker 3>will be 52 years and spooky gunships and</v>
<v Speaker 3>defoliation the united trial.</v>

1522
01:23:06.570 --> 01:23:11.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm with Johnny Depp on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what we've learned is that is the </v>

1523
01:23:11.801 --> 01:23:16.801
<v Speaker 3>economic forces can be at least as </v>
<v Speaker 3>important if not more so than than </v>

1524
01:23:16.801 --> 01:23:18.790
<v Speaker 3>soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And deciding how history plays out.</v>

1525
01:23:21.450 --> 01:23:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Rock and roll and Playboy magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll become American.</v>

1526
01:23:25.870 --> 01:23:27.630
<v Speaker 3>You said it the way</v>

1527
01:23:28.210 --> 01:23:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Max.</v>
