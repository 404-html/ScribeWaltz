<v Speaker 1>Some bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seventh,</v>

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.790
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>41,</v>

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
<v Speaker 1>a date which will live in infamy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Leah events.</v>

5
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.450
<v Speaker 3>The figure is from this time and place I</v>
<v Speaker 3>take pride in being the Alina tear down </v>

6
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.790
<v Speaker 3>drama.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Welcome.</v>

7
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 3>This kind of examination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not their president said,</v>

8
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a crop.</v>

9
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.570
<v Speaker 3>If we dig deep in our district and our </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctrine don't remember,</v>

10
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.720
<v Speaker 3>but we are not descended from fearful of</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

11
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 2>It's hardcore history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember a conversation I had quite a </v>

12
00:01:19.691 --> 00:01:21.670
<v Speaker 2>long time ago now with an author of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

13
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 2>The author had written a book about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>John F Kennedy was assassinated by Lee </v>

14
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 2>Harvey Oswald,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like the government always said it </v>

15
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 2>happened</v>

16
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 2>and I had been asking him a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions about conspiracies and you </v>

17
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.551
<v Speaker 2>know this or that aspect of the Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>assassination and only one of his </v>

18
00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:43.771
<v Speaker 2>answers in a really stands out in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind now because it seems irrelevant on </v>

19
00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:49.030
<v Speaker 2>so many different fronts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the answers on why it was so hard</v>

20
00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:53.200
<v Speaker 2>for some people to accept what this guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>was purporting as the truth he said,</v>

21
00:01:53.201 --> 00:01:58.201
<v Speaker 2>was because people are inherently very </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable with the idea that a </v>

22
00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:04.600
<v Speaker 2>single nobody can have such an effect on</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of our lives.</v>

23
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 2>It's more comforting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said to believe that powerful,</v>

24
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>groups of people or conspiracies are </v>

25
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.221
<v Speaker 2>actually running things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you think those powerful groups </v>

26
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:21.961
<v Speaker 2>are nefarious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's somehow comforting to think that </v>

27
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 2>somebody is in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That it's not all just random number,</v>

28
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.780
<v Speaker 2>that a plane couldn't just drop from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sky and land on your house tomorrow.</v>

29
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.330
<v Speaker 2>And I thought about this when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about know someone,</v>

30
00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:40.331
<v Speaker 2>if somebody had asked you a question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the most important figure in the</v>

31
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.550
<v Speaker 2>past hundred years in terms of why the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world has gone the way it did?</v>

32
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would think of all these famous </v>

33
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.550
<v Speaker 2>people whose names almost anyone who's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>halfway educated would recognize.</v>

34
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.510
<v Speaker 2>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's interesting is you could </v>

35
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 2>conceivably put the name down of </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who was historically speaking,</v>

36
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:01.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

37
00:03:01.101 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 2>nobody,</v>

38
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 2>Lee Harvey Oswald on the pages of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>history books besides the Kennedy </v>

39
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.020
<v Speaker 2>assassination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a nobody,</v>

40
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.150
<v Speaker 2>he didn't do anything else of </v>
<v Speaker 2>importance,</v>

41
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.700
<v Speaker 2>but that event was huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

42
00:03:13.701 --> 00:03:16.190
<v Speaker 2>If he actually killed John F Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way the narrative says,</v>

43
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Lee Harvey Oswald changed the world,</v>

44
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.690
<v Speaker 2>he changed the president instantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

45
00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:26.691
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of us have the potential to </v>

46
00:03:26.691 --> 00:03:27.870
<v Speaker 2>change who the president of the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States is that lone gunman did,</v>

47
00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:32.871
<v Speaker 2>if he was indeed the lone gunman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person who may be most responsible </v>

48
00:03:32.871 --> 00:03:34.500
<v Speaker 2>for the modern world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this entire world,</v>

49
00:03:34.501 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 2>including the nine slash 11 attacks that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

50
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.410
<v Speaker 2>many commentators say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaped the modern world,</v>

51
00:03:40.411 --> 00:03:45.411
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live in an era of terrorism or the </v>

52
00:03:45.411 --> 00:03:49.190
<v Speaker 2>age of terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll hear them say without them </v>

53
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.931
<v Speaker 2>seeming to really understand that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>age of terrorism supposedly sparked by </v>

54
00:03:50.931 --> 00:03:51.960
<v Speaker 2>the nine slash 11 attacks and the very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

55
00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:56.961
<v Speaker 2>very early 21st century or themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifestations of an act of terrorism </v>

56
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.030
<v Speaker 2>that launched us into the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we actually live in an age of </v>

57
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.960
<v Speaker 2>terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as some of these people like to say,</v>

58
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.110
<v Speaker 2>we've been living in it for more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>100 years,</v>

59
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.400
<v Speaker 2>I think you could make the case that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most important individual in the last </v>

60
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 2>century is Gavrilo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Princip and Gavrilo.</v>

61
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Princip is a name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very few of you will recognize.</v>

62
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 2>How can a person have so little </v>
<v Speaker 2>achievement in on the world.</v>

63
00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 2>Stage B perhaps credited with creating </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire world around us.</v>

64
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Gavrilo Princip doesn't live,</v>

65
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:41.950
<v Speaker 2>is there a nine slash 11 attack ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if that was all he did,</v>

66
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:44.680
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't he be important you a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that.</v>

67
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.900
<v Speaker 2>Get principles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason there was a second world war </v>

68
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.810
<v Speaker 2>because Gavrilo Princip is the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a first</v>

69
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 2>and to be fair to principal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could have gone to him and shown </v>

70
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.371
<v Speaker 2>him the ramifications of what that one </v>
<v Speaker 2>day a week due to the world,</v>

71
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.680
<v Speaker 2>I think he'd be horrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't trying to unleash a global </v>

72
00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:14.141
<v Speaker 2>world war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just became the latest example of </v>

73
00:05:14.571 --> 00:05:19.250
<v Speaker 2>someone pulling the trigger in a giant </v>
<v Speaker 2>historical game of Russian roulette.</v>

74
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.080
<v Speaker 2>A trigger that had been pulled several </v>
<v Speaker 2>times already with nothing happening.</v>

75
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.800
<v Speaker 2>Who would have thought that the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>that prince it pulled it,</v>

76
00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:33.801
<v Speaker 2>that would be the time that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphorical revolver pointed at the </v>

77
00:05:33.871 --> 00:05:37.410
<v Speaker 2>skull of the old world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot a bullet into its brain.</v>

78
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps Princip in his compatriots would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have thought that you know sometimes </v>

79
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.940
<v Speaker 2>when you're trying to create a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

80
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.420
<v Speaker 2>you have to utterly destroy the old one </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the people in that old world.</v>

81
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.430
<v Speaker 2>We're not naive about the potential for </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone like a principal to do what they</v>

82
00:05:56.431 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Otto von Bismarck,</v>

83
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:01.610
<v Speaker 2>one of the greatest diplomats of 19th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century Europe,</v>

84
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 2>perhaps the greatest diplomat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany ever produced,</v>

85
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.310
<v Speaker 2>famously said that if there was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be some giant global conflict,</v>

86
00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:14.411
<v Speaker 2>it was going to probably break out </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of some damn fool event in the </v>

87
00:06:14.411 --> 00:06:14.411
<v Speaker 2>Balkans.</v>

88
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Governor Lowe Princip shot two people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the city of Sarajevo smack dab in the </v>

89
00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:26.261
<v Speaker 2>Balkans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A place that Otto von Bismarck had </v>

90
00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:28.030
<v Speaker 2>famously said was not worth the bones of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a single Pomeranian Grenna dear.</v>

91
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.420
<v Speaker 2>It would cost a hell of a lot more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and prince,</v>

92
00:06:33.421 --> 00:06:38.421
<v Speaker 2>it becomes yet another example in </v>
<v Speaker 2>history proving to us that sometimes </v>

93
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:41.310
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism in this era,</v>

94
00:06:41.311 --> 00:06:46.311
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we tried desperately to keep </v>

95
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 2>weapons of mass destruction out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorist hands because we're afraid </v>

96
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.990
<v Speaker 2>they'll be able to kill more people with</v>
<v Speaker 2>such weapons.</v>

97
00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.770
<v Speaker 2>We forget that sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not about how many people you kill.</v>

98
00:06:52.771 --> 00:06:57.771
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's about who they are and </v>
<v Speaker 2>often it's not the terrorist act that </v>

99
00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:03.850
<v Speaker 2>changes the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the response of the victims,</v>

100
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that does Gov reload.</v>

101
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.970
<v Speaker 2>Princip killed two people and he did so </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that almost makes you believe </v>

102
00:07:13.241 --> 00:07:13.870
<v Speaker 2>in fate</v>

103
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.140
<v Speaker 2>and truthfully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not much of a faith believer,</v>

104
00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.400
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things I like about </v>
<v Speaker 2>history is how it forces me to challenge</v>

105
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 2>some of my own preconceptions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly make me think about other </v>

106
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:28.920
<v Speaker 2>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always thought,</v>

107
00:07:28.921 --> 00:07:33.921
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that history unfolds for chaotic </v>

108
00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:37.251
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We that it's somewhat random that </v>

109
00:07:37.251 --> 00:07:39.690
<v Speaker 2>millions of people going about their </v>
<v Speaker 2>lives and their own ways with trends and</v>

110
00:07:39.691 --> 00:07:43.380
<v Speaker 2>forces acting upon them and people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>important positions making decisions and</v>

111
00:07:43.381 --> 00:07:46.860
<v Speaker 2>all of this together creates a dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's completely unpredictable.</v>

112
00:07:46.861 --> 00:07:51.861
<v Speaker 2>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat chaotic and random and unfolds </v>

113
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:55.101
<v Speaker 2>into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think my logical side of the brain </v>

114
00:07:55.101 --> 00:07:58.020
<v Speaker 2>appreciates that sort of viewpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is is that sometimes history</v>

115
00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.710
<v Speaker 2>confronts us with events where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>logical part of,</v>

116
00:08:01.711 --> 00:08:06.711
<v Speaker 2>at least my brain wants to flip sides </v>
<v Speaker 2>and wants to logically defend what I </v>

117
00:08:06.721 --> 00:08:09.600
<v Speaker 2>consider to be the more illogical point </v>
<v Speaker 2>of view.</v>

118
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:15.050
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the logical part of my brain will </v>

119
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.691
<v Speaker 2>sometimes shift and try to defend </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like fate or destiny or </v>

120
00:08:19.261 --> 00:08:24.261
<v Speaker 2>predetermination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those to me are the two ends of the </v>

121
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:27.801
<v Speaker 2>scale chaos on one side and randomness </v>
<v Speaker 2>on one side and fate and predestination </v>

122
00:08:27.801 --> 00:08:32.391
<v Speaker 2>on the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's this weird twilight zone </v>

123
00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:35.061
<v Speaker 2>where the two sort of intersect and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>event that happened in late June.</v>

124
00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:40.370
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 14 is one of the best examples </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll find from history where you know </v>

125
00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:45.321
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The logical side of your brain stands a </v>

126
00:08:45.321 --> 00:08:47.211
<v Speaker 2>pretty good chance of flipping and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to defend the illogical position </v>

127
00:08:47.211 --> 00:08:49.980
<v Speaker 2>that this is somehow predestined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

128
00:08:49.981 --> 00:08:53.820
<v Speaker 2>let me challenge you with a similar kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of analogy.</v>

129
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Assumingly Harvey Oswald did kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>President Kennedy.</v>

130
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:03.290
<v Speaker 2>What if someone showed up right when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>had the rifle and he was aiming at in </v>

131
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.310
<v Speaker 2>the room where he was forcing him to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of Scotch.</v>

132
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:10.310
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing screwed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole assassination attempt at the </v>

133
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 2>last minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

134
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Oswald's storms out of the Texas book </v>
<v Speaker 2>depository,</v>

135
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:18.951
<v Speaker 2>angry that is well laid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plans have been destroyed and he goes </v>

136
00:09:18.951 --> 00:09:23.691
<v Speaker 2>across town to his favorite restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he goes and he gets himself a bite </v>

137
00:09:23.691 --> 00:09:23.691
<v Speaker 2>to eat and when he's coming out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant,</v>

138
00:09:23.691 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 2>angry at how his day has gone right in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of him.</v>

139
00:09:26.491 --> 00:09:30.750
<v Speaker 2>Within five or six feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped below him.</v>

140
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Is John F Kennedy's car with Kennedy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it close to Oswald and on the far side </v>

141
00:09:37.831 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 2>of the president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his wife Jackie.</v>

142
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 2>What are the odds of something like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening?</v>

143
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 2>What would you think if it did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a weird coincidence,</v>

144
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:50.030
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>On June 28th,</v>

145
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:50.940
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>14,</v>

146
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.780
<v Speaker 2>Gavrilo Princip and about 20 other guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a true conspiracy show up in the</v>

147
00:09:57.061 --> 00:10:00.120
<v Speaker 2>city of Sarajevo with murder on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>minds.</v>

148
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.100
<v Speaker 2>They want to kill the the governing </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure.</v>

149
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:10.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Sarajevo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The person who is sort of the Prince </v>

150
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:14.300
<v Speaker 2>Charles plays the same role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prince Charles plays in the British </v>

151
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.391
<v Speaker 2>monarchy right now in the monarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the country that are the overlords in </v>

152
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Sarajevo country that doesn't exist </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

153
00:10:19.861 --> 00:10:22.740
<v Speaker 2>Called Austria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungary and Austria.</v>

154
00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:27.741
<v Speaker 2>Hungary is led by a really old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well loved guy named Franz Joseph </v>

155
00:10:27.741 --> 00:10:32.331
<v Speaker 2>who's going to die soon because he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>very old and the person who will take </v>

156
00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:35.070
<v Speaker 2>over when Franz Joseph dies is this guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming on a visit to Siri,</v>

157
00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.090
<v Speaker 2>afo the Prince Charles of his country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although unlike Prince Charles,</v>

158
00:10:39.091 --> 00:10:44.091
<v Speaker 2>who's role is completely ceremonial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy will actually have some real </v>

159
00:10:44.091 --> 00:10:47.961
<v Speaker 2>power when he gets the throne and for </v>
<v Speaker 2>some you know now when you look back on </v>

160
00:10:47.961 --> 00:10:52.581
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a stupid reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy whose name is archduke Franz </v>

161
00:10:52.581 --> 00:10:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Ferdinand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has decided to go to Sarajevo and watch </v>

162
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.901
<v Speaker 2>military maneuvers which happened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>coincide with the anniversary of the </v>

163
00:10:59.901 --> 00:11:02.070
<v Speaker 2>most emotionally important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart wrenching,</v>

164
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>battlefield lost in all Serb history,</v>

165
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:10.340
<v Speaker 2>the battle of Kosovo way back from </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds and hundreds of years before </v>

166
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:10.530
<v Speaker 2>this time period.</v>

167
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Certain nationalists and the Serbs are </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

168
00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 2>very patriotic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even today,</v>

169
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.200
<v Speaker 2>even more so back in 1914.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this as a slap in the face to </v>

170
00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:22.510
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

171
00:11:22.511 --> 00:11:27.511
<v Speaker 2>A Vo is Slavic and should be part of at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least a Pan Slavic country or maybe part</v>

172
00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:33.051
<v Speaker 2>of Serbia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There had been Balkan wars for the last </v>

173
00:11:33.051 --> 00:11:33.051
<v Speaker 2>decade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

174
00:11:33.051 --> 00:11:37.671
<v Speaker 2>concerned with many of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>nationalistic questions who should own </v>

175
00:11:37.671 --> 00:11:40.431
<v Speaker 2>these areas and it had been in the hands</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Ottoman Turks who the slavs </v>

176
00:11:40.431 --> 00:11:41.070
<v Speaker 2>definitely feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have been running the place.</v>

177
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.070
<v Speaker 2>And it was transferred to the hands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Austria Hungarian empire,</v>

178
00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:47.640
<v Speaker 2>which the Serb nationalists still don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel should be running the place.</v>

179
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.890
<v Speaker 2>And now the archduke was coming on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>anniversary of this historic defeat.</v>

180
00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:58.180
<v Speaker 2>You know from the Serb nationalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint to rub their nose in the fact </v>

181
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.280
<v Speaker 2>that Siri,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eva was still held by a big non slavic </v>

182
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:02.280
<v Speaker 2>empire</v>

183
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.800
<v Speaker 2>and they're going to make Franz </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ferdinand pay for that and in the </v>

184
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.940
<v Speaker 2>remarkably similar situation to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy assassination,</v>

185
00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:15.530
<v Speaker 2>Ferdinand's route for his motorcade is </v>
<v Speaker 2>published ahead of time.</v>

186
00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:20.890
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be arriving and going down</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main boulevards in an open car with </v>

187
00:12:22.011 --> 00:12:27.011
<v Speaker 2>his wife sitting next to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's 20 or so assassins line themselves </v>

188
00:12:27.561 --> 00:12:32.561
<v Speaker 2>up at various intervals on this parade </v>
<v Speaker 2>route and planned to kill the archduke </v>

189
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:37.030
<v Speaker 2>as soon as they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The archduke car is either going too </v>

190
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:39.650
<v Speaker 2>fast or there are too many other serves </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the crowd nearby.</v>

191
00:12:39.651 --> 00:12:44.651
<v Speaker 2>The first few assassins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the first few assassins don't try to </v>

192
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:44.651
<v Speaker 2>make a run at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually he passes.</v>

193
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:47.480
<v Speaker 2>One guy who runs out from the crowd with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bomb,</v>

194
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.900
<v Speaker 2>really more of a hand grenade would be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>good way to describe it today,</v>

195
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.200
<v Speaker 2>and he flings this hand grenade at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>archduke open car in a very athletic </v>

196
00:12:56.271 --> 00:12:56.690
<v Speaker 2>maneuver.</v>

197
00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.870
<v Speaker 2>The archduke sees it ducks behind the </v>
<v Speaker 2>door of the car,</v>

198
00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.480
<v Speaker 2>the hand grenade thing bounces off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>

199
00:13:02.481 --> 00:13:07.481
<v Speaker 2>hits the concrete on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fuse doesn't detonate until the </v>

200
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.730
<v Speaker 2>next car in the motorcade has passed </v>
<v Speaker 2>over it.</v>

201
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.750
<v Speaker 2>It explodes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some 20 people are badly hurt in a blood</v>

202
00:13:14.751 --> 00:13:15.740
<v Speaker 2>on the street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing.</v>

203
00:13:15.741 --> 00:13:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crowd scatters.</v>

204
00:13:17.151 --> 00:13:19.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the parade is over.</v>

205
00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:25.780
<v Speaker 2>The would be assassins shoves a cyanide </v>
<v Speaker 2>pill into his mouth and runs down into </v>

206
00:13:25.821 --> 00:13:28.250
<v Speaker 2>the side of the street and jumps in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>river,</v>

207
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:33.740
<v Speaker 2>but the cyanide pill is defective and </v>
<v Speaker 2>only makes them vomit and the river is </v>

208
00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.230
<v Speaker 2>only about six inches deep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they capture him very quickly and run</v>

209
00:13:36.231 --> 00:13:41.231
<v Speaker 2>him off to be interrogated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And basically the whole day is now </v>

210
00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:41.930
<v Speaker 2>scotched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the other assassins along the parade</v>

211
00:13:41.931 --> 00:13:45.980
<v Speaker 2>route have had their chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spoiled and everybody breaks up and goes</v>

212
00:13:45.981 --> 00:13:48.980
<v Speaker 2>their separate ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crowd dissipates and the motorcade,</v>

213
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:54.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes off in a couple of different </v>

214
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:54.180
<v Speaker 2>directions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The injured or taken to hospitals in the</v>

215
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.761
<v Speaker 2>archduke goes to the local magistrates </v>
<v Speaker 2>residents to lodge a complaint.</v>

216
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:01.480
<v Speaker 2>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

217
00:14:01.481 --> 00:14:06.481
<v Speaker 2>there's a bullet dodge literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so after complaining to the local </v>

218
00:14:06.521 --> 00:14:10.390
<v Speaker 2>authority is the archduke decides </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of just leaving town,</v>

219
00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:10.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

220
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.920
<v Speaker 2>he almost got killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but instead of leaving town in a very </v>

221
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:15.920
<v Speaker 2>heroic sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

222
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:21.190
<v Speaker 2>movie decides no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he needs to visit the people injured in </v>

223
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.911
<v Speaker 2>the bombing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just going to go to the hospital and he </v>

224
00:14:23.911 --> 00:14:27.301
<v Speaker 2>gets back into the open car with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife and they speed off toward the </v>

225
00:14:28.871 --> 00:14:31.720
<v Speaker 2>hospital to talk to the wounded and </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfort the wounded.</v>

226
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.140
<v Speaker 2>The local authorities are worried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you might imagine.</v>

227
00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:38.890
<v Speaker 2>So they give him some extra security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including one guy who was,</v>

228
00:14:38.891 --> 00:14:42.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm a member of a local aristocracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>account named France Bon Herat.</v>

229
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:48.330
<v Speaker 2>And her rock takes a position on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>running board right by the archduke side</v>

230
00:14:48.331 --> 00:14:50.730
<v Speaker 2>of the car and they speed off for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospital.</v>

231
00:14:50.731 --> 00:14:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Now no one knows where the arch duke is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going now.</v>

232
00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:57.230
<v Speaker 2>None of the people who were would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>assassins or anything.</v>

233
00:14:57.231 --> 00:15:02.231
<v Speaker 2>This is not a published route.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knows that the archduke is </v>

234
00:15:02.231 --> 00:15:03.500
<v Speaker 2>heading in this direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the car drives toward the hospital.</v>

235
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.740
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Gavrilo Princip has gone to get</v>

236
00:15:06.741 --> 00:15:09.650
<v Speaker 2>a sandwich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean his day has been totally destroyed.</v>

237
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:14.950
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't have been in a good mood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He must've felt like they'd failed </v>

238
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.471
<v Speaker 2>somewhat and the driver of the archduke </v>
<v Speaker 2>car not really knowing the route very </v>

239
00:15:17.721 --> 00:15:19.460
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>charged down a street,</v>

240
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:24.050
<v Speaker 2>realizes he's on the wrong street and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reverses the car,</v>

241
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:30.160
<v Speaker 2>but this is 1914 and cars are relatively</v>
<v Speaker 2>new and simply reversing a car could </v>

242
00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.970
<v Speaker 2>stall the engine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is exactly what happens.</v>

243
00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:34.130
<v Speaker 2>He tries to reverse the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the engine stalls,</v>

244
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.990
<v Speaker 2>and there it is sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not moving,</v>

245
00:15:35.991 --> 00:15:40.991
<v Speaker 2>and they're trying to get it started </v>
<v Speaker 2>again and out of the restaurant where </v>

246
00:15:40.991 --> 00:15:45.011
<v Speaker 2>he'd gone to get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could say constellation </v>

247
00:15:45.011 --> 00:15:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Sandwich to make them feel a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>better about how his bad day went.</v>

248
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Steps Gavrilo Princip who looks up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sees his target from a little while ago,</v>

249
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:59.170
<v Speaker 2>five feet away from him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>immobile and slightly below him in an </v>

250
00:15:59.961 --> 00:16:00.920
<v Speaker 2>open car</v>

251
00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:06.760
<v Speaker 2>and he whips out his pistol and shoots </v>
<v Speaker 2>him and his wife.</v>

252
00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:13.410
<v Speaker 2>What are the odds of that happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's considered to be one of the most </v>

253
00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:19.141
<v Speaker 2>wild coincidences in all of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>history and we sometimes forget because </v>

254
00:16:22.151 --> 00:16:27.151
<v Speaker 2>it's such a monumental historical moment</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is still a terrorist attack </v>

255
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:32.020
<v Speaker 2>and it was quite upsetting to either </v>
<v Speaker 2>witness or lived through.</v>

256
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Part of what makes these things seemed </v>
<v Speaker 2>so unreal is that we only have grainy </v>

257
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:42.830
<v Speaker 2>black and white footage of even the </v>
<v Speaker 2>events before that you can go see movies</v>

258
00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:47.831
<v Speaker 2>where you can see the archduke and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife getting ready to go into the </v>

259
00:16:47.831 --> 00:16:51.011
<v Speaker 2>motorcade and you get an idea of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they looked like and it's all kind of </v>

260
00:16:51.011 --> 00:16:53.741
<v Speaker 2>moving a little too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way those old fashioned movies were </v>

261
00:16:53.741 --> 00:16:53.741
<v Speaker 2>and everything and it just doesn't look </v>
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

262
00:16:53.741 --> 00:16:58.450
<v Speaker 2>But you can go and you can see pictures </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have saved the tunic that </v>

263
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:02.561
<v Speaker 2>the archduke was wearing that day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see in living color that this </v>

264
00:17:02.561 --> 00:17:07.121
<v Speaker 2>was a bright light blue tunic and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>feathers on the helmet he was wearing </v>

265
00:17:07.121 --> 00:17:07.430
<v Speaker 2>were bright green.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

266
00:17:07.431 --> 00:17:09.320
<v Speaker 2>it must've been the most colorful site </v>
<v Speaker 2>imaginable,</v>

267
00:17:09.321 --> 00:17:14.321
<v Speaker 2>but after princip fired the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>colorful site imaginable became a lot </v>

268
00:17:14.321 --> 00:17:18.041
<v Speaker 2>more gory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's a tear in the tunic </v>

269
00:17:18.041 --> 00:17:21.790
<v Speaker 2>where the bullet exited the archduke </v>
<v Speaker 2>neck and the tunic is covered and what </v>

270
00:17:22.761 --> 00:17:25.400
<v Speaker 2>is unmistakably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even 100 years later,</v>

271
00:17:25.401 --> 00:17:30.401
<v Speaker 2>blood and blood has always been one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those things where when you see it in </v>

272
00:17:30.951 --> 00:17:33.080
<v Speaker 2>living color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing like it.</v>

273
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:38.590
<v Speaker 2>I tend to believe human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 2>programmed to react to that specific </v>

274
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:39.080
<v Speaker 2>color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

275
00:17:39.081 --> 00:17:44.081
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the difference between seeing blood </v>

276
00:17:44.081 --> 00:17:46.100
<v Speaker 2>in black and white and blood and color </v>
<v Speaker 2>is there's nothing quite like that.</v>

277
00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 2>The person who was closest</v>

278
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.440
<v Speaker 3>to the whole thing was count von </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>

279
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.700
<v Speaker 3>who was on the running board,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not doing that great of a job apparently</v>

280
00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:58.830
<v Speaker 3>at security,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he says,</v>

281
00:17:58.831 --> 00:18:02.640
<v Speaker 3>as soon as the shots were fired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they reversed the car</v>

282
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 2>and he later testified this quote,</v>

283
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:12.860
<v Speaker 2>as the car quickly reversed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thin stream of blood spurted from his </v>

284
00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:13.350
<v Speaker 2>highness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his mouth onto my right cheek.</v>

285
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.710
<v Speaker 2>As I was pulling out my handkerchief to </v>
<v Speaker 2>wipe the blood away from his mouth.</v>

286
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.770
<v Speaker 2>The dutchess cried out to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For God's sake.</v>

287
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.920
<v Speaker 2>What has happened to you at that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She slid off the seat and lay on the </v>

288
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.680
<v Speaker 2>floor of the car with her face between </v>
<v Speaker 2>his knees.</v>

289
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.580
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea that she too was hit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought that she had simply fainted with</v>

290
00:18:29.581 --> 00:18:32.400
<v Speaker 2>fright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I heard his imperial highness say,</v>

291
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Sophie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sophie,</v>

292
00:18:33.841 --> 00:18:36.360
<v Speaker 2>don't die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stay alive for the children.</v>

293
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.720
<v Speaker 2>At that I seized the archduke by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>collar of his uniform to stop his head </v>

294
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.290
<v Speaker 2>drooping forward and asked him if he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>in great pain.</v>

295
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.960
<v Speaker 2>He answered me quite distinctly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is nothing.</v>

296
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:51.350
<v Speaker 2>His face began to twist somewhat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he went on repeating six or seven </v>

297
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.070
<v Speaker 2>times evermore faintly as he gradually </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost consciousness.</v>

298
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:58.280
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then came a brief pause followed by a </v>

299
00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.820
<v Speaker 2>convulsive rattling his throat caused by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the loss of blood.</v>

300
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.640
<v Speaker 2>This ceased on arrival at the governor's</v>
<v Speaker 2>residence.</v>

301
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:07.910
<v Speaker 2>That to unconscious bodies were carried </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the building where their death was </v>

302
00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:07.910
<v Speaker 2>soon established.</v>

303
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:13.130
<v Speaker 2>End Quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as a way to sort of prove that the </v>

304
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.171
<v Speaker 2>old adage that one man's terrorist is </v>
<v Speaker 2>another man's freedom fighter is true.</v>

305
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:23.560
<v Speaker 2>The spot where princip was standing when</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fired those fatal shots are </v>

306
00:19:23.661 --> 00:19:26.440
<v Speaker 2>immortalized now in the city of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarajevo.</v>

307
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.580
<v Speaker 2>With a plaque and the actual footsteps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

308
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:34.660
<v Speaker 2>in metal on the ground where the spot </v>
<v Speaker 2>was to Serbs,</v>

309
00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:41.520
<v Speaker 2>this guy was a hero and to his </v>
<v Speaker 2>compatriots who all realized that they </v>

310
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.661
<v Speaker 2>were like Desperados at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all realized that they would be </v>

311
00:19:45.701 --> 00:19:47.200
<v Speaker 2>immortalized too,</v>

312
00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:53.790
<v Speaker 2>and the actual circumstances by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where this plot was hatched are worthy </v>

313
00:19:54.041 --> 00:19:59.041
<v Speaker 2>of a spy novel and it's hard to believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't been romanticized to some </v>

314
00:19:59.041 --> 00:19:59.041
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But nevertheless,</v>

315
00:19:59.041 --> 00:20:03.730
<v Speaker 2>if you ever do the definitive big screen</v>
<v Speaker 2>dramatization of World War One,</v>

316
00:20:03.731 --> 00:20:06.760
<v Speaker 2>the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you want to start your movie off</v>

317
00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:12.210
<v Speaker 2>with that scene inside that Belgrade </v>
<v Speaker 2>cafe obscure place Kinda run down lit </v>

318
00:20:13.961 --> 00:20:18.961
<v Speaker 2>only by candle light with a group of 19 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and 20 year old guys at a table.</v>

319
00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:25.860
<v Speaker 2>I always have to remind myself how young</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are not old enough to </v>

320
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.150
<v Speaker 2>legally drink alcohol in the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States is how old these people are.</v>

321
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:32.530
<v Speaker 2>And then we're told by people who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>there that what happened is one of their</v>

322
00:20:32.531 --> 00:20:35.050
<v Speaker 2>number comes in the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sits down at the table with them and has</v>

323
00:20:35.051 --> 00:20:40.051
<v Speaker 2>a package with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he opens up the package and inside </v>

324
00:20:40.051 --> 00:20:41.140
<v Speaker 2>is only one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a newspaper clipping.</v>

325
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:42.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

326
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.410
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not signed it by anybody.</v>

327
00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:46.690
<v Speaker 2>No directions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a newspaper clipping.</v>

328
00:20:46.691 --> 00:20:47.890
<v Speaker 2>And the clipping announces</v>

329
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.140
<v Speaker 4>the imminent visit of the archduke Franz</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ferdinand to Siri,</v>

330
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:57.150
<v Speaker 4>Ava,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the people who was at that table </v>

331
00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:01.441
<v Speaker 4>and lived to grow older and write about </v>
<v Speaker 4>his experiences after he'd had time to </v>

332
00:21:01.441 --> 00:21:05.380
<v Speaker 4>go from terrorists to Patriot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy named Jeff Church.</v>

333
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.710
<v Speaker 4>And if I mispronounced that by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just get used to that.</v>

334
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:14.400
<v Speaker 4>This is going to be perhaps the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>linguistically and essentially </v>

335
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.151
<v Speaker 4>challenging show I've ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm sure to mangle many beautiful </v>

336
00:21:18.151 --> 00:21:18.151
<v Speaker 4>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

337
00:21:18.151 --> 00:21:22.801
<v Speaker 4>first and foremost French.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So my apologies to all of you in </v>

338
00:21:22.801 --> 00:21:25.741
<v Speaker 4>advance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry I have limitations and you're </v>

339
00:21:25.741 --> 00:21:27.280
<v Speaker 4>going to hear them all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm bored.</v>

340
00:21:27.281 --> 00:21:32.281
<v Speaker 4>Shoved Jeff Church wrote years later </v>
<v Speaker 4>this about that moment in history that </v>

341
00:21:32.281 --> 00:21:37.231
<v Speaker 4>will turn out to be so very important in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a way that you can't imagine anyone at </v>

342
00:21:37.231 --> 00:21:41.191
<v Speaker 4>the table then would have known they </v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't know they were pulling the </v>

343
00:21:41.191 --> 00:21:42.190
<v Speaker 4>trigger again and that Russian roulette </v>
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>

344
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.880
<v Speaker 4>And they certainly didn't know that if </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>

345
00:21:43.881 --> 00:21:46.480
<v Speaker 4>that was the time there was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>a bullet in the chamber.</v>

346
00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:48.180
<v Speaker 4>So you have to troll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

347
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:49.270
<v Speaker 4>after the fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

348
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:54.750
<v Speaker 4>a tiny clipping from a newspaper mailed </v>
<v Speaker 4>without comment from a secret band of </v>

349
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.340
<v Speaker 4>terrorists in Zagreb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a capital of Croatia,</v>

350
00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.520
<v Speaker 4>to their comrades in Belgrade was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>torch which set the world of fire with </v>

351
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.811
<v Speaker 4>the war in 1914,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that bit of paper wrecked old proud </v>

352
00:22:06.811 --> 00:22:09.940
<v Speaker 4>empires.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gave birth to new free nations.</v>

353
00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:13.090
<v Speaker 4>I was one of the members of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrorist band in Belgrade,</v>

354
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:18.390
<v Speaker 4>which received it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in those days I and my companions </v>

355
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.290
<v Speaker 4>were regarded as desperate criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A price was on our heads.</v>

356
00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:25.530
<v Speaker 4>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my little band is seen in a different </v>

357
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:27.721
<v Speaker 4>light as pioneer patriots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is recognized that our secret plans </v>

358
00:22:27.721 --> 00:22:32.400
<v Speaker 4>hatched in an obscure cafe and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>capital of old Serbia have led to the </v>

359
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.750
<v Speaker 4>independence of the new Yugoslavia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the United Nation set free from Austrian</v>

360
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:36.550
<v Speaker 4>domination.</v>

361
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.780
<v Speaker 4>And to quote now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever since that time,</v>

362
00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:46.140
<v Speaker 4>people have been wondering how connected</v>
<v Speaker 4>that group was to outside entities.</v>

363
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:52.770
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just a bunch of small little self </v>

364
00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.520
<v Speaker 4>organized terror groups put together by </v>
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of young kids,</v>

365
00:22:54.521 --> 00:22:56.860
<v Speaker 4>or are they working for a larger entity </v>
<v Speaker 4>today?</v>

366
00:22:56.861 --> 00:23:01.240
<v Speaker 4>We would ask whether or not they were an</v>
<v Speaker 4>example of state sponsored terrorism.</v>

367
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.070
<v Speaker 4>Was there a power behind this group </v>
<v Speaker 4>arrival power,</v>

368
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:11.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean in to understand how big of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal this could be in a Europe that was </v>

369
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:14.911
<v Speaker 4>already kind of unsteady and stressed in</v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of stability.</v>

370
00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:20.560
<v Speaker 4>Imagine the United States president or a</v>
<v Speaker 4>president or two from now.</v>

371
00:23:20.561 --> 00:23:25.450
<v Speaker 4>We don't want to be controversial down </v>
<v Speaker 4>the road is assassinated and we have all</v>

372
00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:30.451
<v Speaker 4>the shock and anger and desire for </v>
<v Speaker 4>retribution that comes with that and </v>

373
00:23:30.451 --> 00:23:32.260
<v Speaker 4>then very shortly after an assassin is </v>
<v Speaker 4>captured,</v>

374
00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:37.620
<v Speaker 4>we figure out that that assassin is </v>
<v Speaker 4>working with the intelligence service </v>

375
00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.360
<v Speaker 4>for our most antagonistic enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

376
00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:45.361
<v Speaker 4>think for a second how America would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have reacted if Lee Harvey Oswald had </v>

377
00:23:46.431 --> 00:23:50.120
<v Speaker 4>been a hit man for Moscow and that came </v>
<v Speaker 4>to light,</v>

378
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:55.220
<v Speaker 4>which by the way is not that outrageous </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing to consider.</v>

379
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.180
<v Speaker 4>When you look at Oswald's ties to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Soviet Union and Cuba,</v>

380
00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:06.080
<v Speaker 4>think about how the American people </v>
<v Speaker 4>would have reacted regardless of what </v>

381
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.670
<v Speaker 4>the facts were if they thought that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>the case,</v>

382
00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:14.270
<v Speaker 4>and it's interesting to note that that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>only a year after the Cuban missile </v>

383
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:17.751
<v Speaker 4>crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a year after world war three is </v>

384
00:24:17.751 --> 00:24:20.391
<v Speaker 4>potentially dodged.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think the leaders of the </v>

385
00:24:20.391 --> 00:24:21.090
<v Speaker 4>United States after Kennedy is </v>
<v Speaker 4>assassinated,</v>

386
00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:25.500
<v Speaker 4>are worried about in terms of worst case</v>
<v Speaker 4>scenarios?</v>

387
00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:30.980
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it might have occurred to </v>
<v Speaker 4>them men who by the early 19 sixties had</v>

388
00:24:31.051 --> 00:24:35.280
<v Speaker 4>grown up during and in the immediate </v>
<v Speaker 4>years after the first World War,</v>

389
00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:39.540
<v Speaker 4>do you think they might have been seeing</v>
<v Speaker 4>in their mind's eye history,</v>

390
00:24:39.541 --> 00:24:44.541
<v Speaker 4>repeating itself?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A world leader killed by a gunman in an </v>

391
00:24:45.241 --> 00:24:50.241
<v Speaker 4>open car with his wife sitting next to </v>
<v Speaker 4>him in public by a young person may be </v>

392
00:24:54.391 --> 00:24:59.391
<v Speaker 4>working for a foreign government and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then having the world spiral out of </v>

393
00:24:59.701 --> 00:25:03.780
<v Speaker 4>control despite what the major players </v>
<v Speaker 4>may have wanted.</v>

394
00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:09.020
<v Speaker 4>Do you think the people around Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 4>might have worried a little about how </v>

395
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.201
<v Speaker 4>that might have turned out?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because those guys in that cafe very </v>

396
00:25:12.201 --> 00:25:14.370
<v Speaker 4>well may have been working for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Serbian intelligence service.</v>

397
00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:19.230
<v Speaker 4>There's been a lot written about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one knows for sure.</v>

398
00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.430
<v Speaker 4>They certainly have ties to groups that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the United States today,</v>

399
00:25:24.431 --> 00:25:29.431
<v Speaker 4>if we were ranking groups from 1914,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would probably call terrorist groups </v>

400
00:25:29.431 --> 00:25:33.160
<v Speaker 4>like young Bosnia and another one called</v>
<v Speaker 4>the black hand,</v>

401
00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:36.550
<v Speaker 4>and these groups had ties sometimes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Serbian intelligence service,</v>

402
00:25:36.551 --> 00:25:39.100
<v Speaker 4>so you can believe the historian where </v>
<v Speaker 4>the investigator,</v>

403
00:25:39.101 --> 00:25:40.960
<v Speaker 4>you want to believe it's a hot button </v>
<v Speaker 4>issue.</v>

404
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:43.270
<v Speaker 4>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it isn't so important.</v>

405
00:25:43.271 --> 00:25:48.271
<v Speaker 4>What really happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like it isn't so important whether </v>

406
00:25:48.271 --> 00:25:48.670
<v Speaker 4>or not Oswald was working for the Soviet</v>
<v Speaker 4>Union.</v>

407
00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:54.100
<v Speaker 4>What's important is what did the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the ground effected by this think was</v>

408
00:25:54.101 --> 00:25:59.101
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The US public thought Oswald was a </v>

409
00:25:59.101 --> 00:25:59.101
<v Speaker 4>hitman from Moscow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens then?</v>

410
00:25:59.101 --> 00:26:03.840
<v Speaker 4>The Austrians thought the killing of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their heir to the throne was an active </v>

411
00:26:03.971 --> 00:26:07.210
<v Speaker 4>state sponsored terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if it wasn't,</v>

412
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.510
<v Speaker 4>they were going to make the case that it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was anyway.</v>

413
00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.610
<v Speaker 4>There's really no doubt that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Austrian Hungarian Empire wanted to deal</v>

414
00:26:17.611 --> 00:26:20.790
<v Speaker 4>with this Serbian problem that had been </v>
<v Speaker 4>bedeviling it for some time,</v>

415
00:26:20.791 --> 00:26:23.490
<v Speaker 4>once and for all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and to be honest,</v>

416
00:26:23.491 --> 00:26:28.491
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to blame them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the Serbians and the Slavs will </v>

417
00:26:28.491 --> 00:26:33.440
<v Speaker 4>counter with the idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Austro-hungarian had not possess this </v>

418
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.890
<v Speaker 4>territory for very long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bosnia Herzegovina and places like Siri,</v>

419
00:26:35.891 --> 00:26:38.490
<v Speaker 4>Ava had not been Austro-hungarian for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>long time.</v>

420
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:42.360
<v Speaker 4>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you try to think of what nation state on</v>

421
00:26:42.361 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 4>the planet could put</v>

422
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:49.100
<v Speaker 2>up with the nation over their border </v>
<v Speaker 2>fomenting revolution in their country </v>

423
00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.850
<v Speaker 2>and eventually killing their public </v>
<v Speaker 2>figures.</v>

424
00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:52.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if you're an American.</v>

425
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:58.130
<v Speaker 2>This happening in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine say Mexico creating instability </v>

426
00:27:00.511 --> 00:27:05.511
<v Speaker 2>and unrest and fomenting subversion and </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution in places like southern Texas</v>

427
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.060
<v Speaker 2>and southern New Mexico and southern </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arizona and southern California,</v>

428
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:14.180
<v Speaker 2>and then eventually these </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionaries that have been Egged on </v>

429
00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:17.190
<v Speaker 2>by the Mexican intelligence service kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>a major US public figure.</v>

430
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.700
<v Speaker 2>How long do you think United States will</v>
<v Speaker 2>put up with something like that?</v>

431
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:27.350
<v Speaker 2>The reason it becomes so important </v>
<v Speaker 2>though is because of all the many </v>

432
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:31.671
<v Speaker 2>controversies in the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the most enduring and important </v>

433
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:36.490
<v Speaker 2>is who's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything that's about to happen is you</v>

434
00:27:36.491 --> 00:27:38.230
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this is a civil lawsuit,</v>

435
00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:43.280
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out who's responsible </v>
<v Speaker 2>for damages is a key part of this story </v>

436
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:48.860
<v Speaker 2>and the Austrian Hungarian Empire is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a position to decide to go or not to go </v>

437
00:27:49.621 --> 00:27:50.100
<v Speaker 2>to war.</v>

438
00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.870
<v Speaker 2>That seems to put them in the driver's </v>
<v Speaker 2>seat.</v>

439
00:27:51.871 --> 00:27:56.490
<v Speaker 2>Responsibility Wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are Austrians though,</v>

440
00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:01.850
<v Speaker 2>living at the time who basically say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what choice did they have?</v>

441
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Take this Austrian writing after the war</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a perfect example.</v>

442
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:13.700
<v Speaker 2>He talks about archduke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Franz Ferdinand is one of the best </v>

443
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.520
<v Speaker 2>friends the slavs ever had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in effect,</v>

444
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:20.180
<v Speaker 2>Ferdinand actually was counseling his </v>
<v Speaker 2>government to treat the Serbian problem </v>

445
00:28:20.281 --> 00:28:23.970
<v Speaker 2>more lightly because he was worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it's sparking a general war.</v>

446
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:29.600
<v Speaker 2>When he was killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was seen as an extra perfidious act </v>

447
00:28:30.481 --> 00:28:34.770
<v Speaker 2>because the Slavic folks had killed a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who had been,</v>

448
00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:40.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of their better friends in the </v>

449
00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.661
<v Speaker 2>Austrian government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Austrian that I was telling you </v>

450
00:28:41.661 --> 00:28:44.970
<v Speaker 2>about a second ago after the first World</v>
<v Speaker 2>War wrote this quote,</v>

451
00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.710
<v Speaker 2>when the news of the murder of archduke </v>
<v Speaker 2>Franz Ferdinand arrived in Munich.</v>

452
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.070
<v Speaker 2>I happened to be sitting at home and </v>
<v Speaker 2>heard of it only vaguely.</v>

453
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:58.340
<v Speaker 2>I was at first seized with worry that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bullets may have been shot from the </v>

454
00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.761
<v Speaker 2>pistols of German students who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>indignation at the heirs apparent </v>

455
00:29:01.761 --> 00:29:04.830
<v Speaker 2>continuous work of Slava.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ization wanted to free the German people</v>

456
00:29:04.831 --> 00:29:09.831
<v Speaker 2>from this internal enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the consequence of this would have </v>

457
00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:12.981
<v Speaker 2>been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was easy to imagine a new wave of </v>

458
00:29:12.981 --> 00:29:15.470
<v Speaker 2>persecution which now would have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>justified and explained in the eyes of </v>

459
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:19.050
<v Speaker 2>the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when soon afterward I heard the name</v>

460
00:29:19.051 --> 00:29:24.051
<v Speaker 2>of the supposed that assassins and </v>
<v Speaker 2>moreover read that they had been </v>

461
00:29:24.051 --> 00:29:27.231
<v Speaker 2>identified as Serbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A light shutter began to run through me </v>

462
00:29:27.231 --> 00:29:28.440
<v Speaker 2>at this vengeance of inscrutable </v>
<v Speaker 2>destiny.</v>

463
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.800
<v Speaker 2>The greatest friend of the slobs had </v>
<v Speaker 2>fallen beneath the bullets of Slavic </v>

464
00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.460
<v Speaker 2>fanatics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone he says,</v>

465
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:40.670
<v Speaker 2>with constant occasion in the last years</v>
<v Speaker 2>to observe the relation of Austria to </v>

466
00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:44.501
<v Speaker 2>Serbia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could not for a be in doubt that the </v>

467
00:29:44.501 --> 00:29:46.750
<v Speaker 2>stone had been set rolling whose course </v>
<v Speaker 2>could no longer be arrested.</v>

468
00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:53.030
<v Speaker 2>Those who today he writes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shower the Viennese government with </v>

469
00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:54.720
<v Speaker 2>reproaches on the form and content of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this ultimatum.</v>

470
00:29:54.721 --> 00:29:59.721
<v Speaker 2>It issued do it an injustice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No other power in the world could have </v>

471
00:29:59.721 --> 00:30:03.981
<v Speaker 2>acted differently in the same situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the same position at her south </v>

472
00:30:03.981 --> 00:30:08.311
<v Speaker 2>eastern border,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Austria possessed in an Oxford and </v>

473
00:30:08.311 --> 00:30:09.180
<v Speaker 2>mortal enemy who had shorter and shorter</v>
<v Speaker 2>intervals,</v>

474
00:30:09.181 --> 00:30:14.181
<v Speaker 2>kept challenging the monarchy and would </v>
<v Speaker 2>never have left off until the moment </v>

475
00:30:14.181 --> 00:30:17.710
<v Speaker 2>favorable for the shattering of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>empire had arrived and quote.</v>

476
00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:23.740
<v Speaker 2>I actually agree with that and it makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>me uncomfortable because the Austrian </v>

477
00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:28.281
<v Speaker 2>writing that statement after the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>world war is the man most responsible </v>

478
00:30:28.281 --> 00:30:30.780
<v Speaker 2>for beginning the second adult Hitler.</v>

479
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:37.590
<v Speaker 2>The one line that I think Hitler Eridean</v>
<v Speaker 2>though was his line that this stone had </v>

480
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:42.571
<v Speaker 2>been set rolling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that nothing could arrest because </v>

481
00:30:42.571 --> 00:30:44.110
<v Speaker 2>something could have arrested it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>something had been arresting it.</v>

482
00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:46.420
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason that the ostrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungarians had an attack.</v>

483
00:30:46.421 --> 00:30:51.421
<v Speaker 2>The Serbs are ready,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason was that the Serbs had a </v>

484
00:30:51.421 --> 00:30:54.731
<v Speaker 2>very powerful friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Russians who considered themselves </v>

485
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:59.290
<v Speaker 2>the traditional protectors of the Slavs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Serbs were not alone.</v>

486
00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:04.590
<v Speaker 2>Most of the powers of Europe had at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least one and usually more powerful </v>

487
00:31:04.661 --> 00:31:09.190
<v Speaker 2>friends and allies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was the era in European history and</v>

488
00:31:09.191 --> 00:31:14.191
<v Speaker 2>it's often used as an example of one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the main reasons this whole story </v>

489
00:31:14.191 --> 00:31:17.230
<v Speaker 2>unfolds the way it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the era of a very complex web of</v>

490
00:31:17.231 --> 00:31:21.130
<v Speaker 2>alliances that bind European countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>to each other.</v>

491
00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:26.320
<v Speaker 2>It's perhaps the most enduring work of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Otto von Bismarck can.</v>

492
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.660
<v Speaker 2>We mentioned earlier the 19th century </v>
<v Speaker 2>German diplomat,</v>

493
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:32.560
<v Speaker 2>bismarck played a very large role in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>foundation of modern Germany,</v>

494
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.970
<v Speaker 2>but he also played a huge role in </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating a system of alliances that both</v>

495
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.220
<v Speaker 2>expanded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

496
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:43.230
<v Speaker 2>Germany's possibilities while at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same time preserving a general peace in </v>

497
00:31:43.961 --> 00:31:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were wars between Napoleon and the</v>

498
00:31:46.931 --> 00:31:51.931
<v Speaker 2>first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about that and some of </v>

499
00:31:51.931 --> 00:31:54.151
<v Speaker 2>them were directly the fault of Bismark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there wasn't a general European </v>

500
00:31:54.161 --> 00:31:59.161
<v Speaker 2>conflict involving all the major powers </v>
<v Speaker 2>and let's not forget that this is an era</v>

501
00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:03.130
<v Speaker 2>that we would today call a multipolar </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

502
00:32:03.131 --> 00:32:07.420
<v Speaker 2>which is hard for us to understand in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>era of one or two super powers.</v>

503
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:12.840
<v Speaker 2>Europe during this time period had at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least five first rate power states,</v>

504
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:15.520
<v Speaker 2>Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>France,</v>

505
00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.410
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>

506
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:21.580
<v Speaker 2>and the Austrian Hungarian Empire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many people throw in Turkey and Italy to</v>

507
00:32:21.581 --> 00:32:24.130
<v Speaker 2>which would make seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These states all,</v>

508
00:32:24.131 --> 00:32:29.131
<v Speaker 2>we're bound to each other with complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>alliance systems and complex is the way </v>

509
00:32:30.711 --> 00:32:35.711
<v Speaker 2>bismarck wanted it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bismarck had set it up so that basically</v>

510
00:32:36.501 --> 00:32:39.170
<v Speaker 2>no matter what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was in the driver's</v>

511
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.880
<v Speaker 4>and this worked unbelievably well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially for German interests,</v>

512
00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:46.610
<v Speaker 4>but for European interests as well as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole for a long time.</v>

513
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:52.330
<v Speaker 4>But by the time 1914 rolls around this </v>
<v Speaker 4>genius who create this system that's so </v>

514
00:32:52.731 --> 00:32:54.770
<v Speaker 4>complex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only he knew how to run it.</v>

515
00:32:55.220 --> 00:33:00.220
<v Speaker 4>I've taken whole courses on Biz markie </v>
<v Speaker 4>and diplomacy from professors who spent </v>

516
00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:03.410
<v Speaker 4>their whole life studying it and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know why he did some of the things</v>

517
00:33:03.411 --> 00:33:07.640
<v Speaker 4>he did while he was running it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was fantastic.</v>

518
00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:12.500
<v Speaker 4>By the time 1914 rolls around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he hasn't been running it for some time.</v>

519
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:18.520
<v Speaker 4>He'd been fired by the leader of Germany</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now this complex machine that the </v>

520
00:33:20.001 --> 00:33:24.170
<v Speaker 4>genius of Bismarck had created and run </v>
<v Speaker 4>was being run by people who couldn't,</v>

521
00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:29.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>carry his jockstrap is what we used to </v>

522
00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:32.441
<v Speaker 4>say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was inevitable that something like </v>

523
00:33:32.441 --> 00:33:35.831
<v Speaker 4>that would break down the reason that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Austra Hungarians didn't just march </v>

524
00:33:36.621 --> 00:33:38.120
<v Speaker 4>into Serbia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

525
00:33:38.121 --> 00:33:43.121
<v Speaker 4>the minute they found out that the Serbs</v>
<v Speaker 4>were responsible for killing their heir </v>

526
00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:46.631
<v Speaker 4>to the throne,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that they knew that would mean war </v>

527
00:33:46.631 --> 00:33:49.031
<v Speaker 4>with Russia and that is something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ostrow Hungarians were not prepared </v>

528
00:33:49.031 --> 00:33:49.031
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>

529
00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:54.550
<v Speaker 4>At least not without checking with their</v>
<v Speaker 4>main friend on the world stage and </v>

530
00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:55.430
<v Speaker 4>finding out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

531
00:33:55.431 --> 00:34:00.170
<v Speaker 4>what they would do in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their main friend on the world stage was</v>

532
00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:05.171
<v Speaker 4>the German empire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the German empires attitude is very </v>

533
00:34:05.171 --> 00:34:07.070
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first thing I have to keep reminding</v>

534
00:34:07.071 --> 00:34:12.071
<v Speaker 4>myself about the German Empire during </v>
<v Speaker 4>this era is that it's relatively young.</v>

535
00:34:12.141 --> 00:34:15.230
<v Speaker 4>It's a new country almost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was only founded in 18,</v>

536
00:34:15.231 --> 00:34:20.231
<v Speaker 4>71.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like 40 years before this era and </v>

537
00:34:20.231 --> 00:34:24.461
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't just a new country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The minute it was proclaimed and that's </v>

538
00:34:24.461 --> 00:34:25.040
<v Speaker 4>how it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't proclaiming England,</v>

539
00:34:25.041 --> 00:34:27.410
<v Speaker 4>you didn't proclaim France,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Germany is a modern nation.</v>

540
00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:30.080
<v Speaker 4>There was like a day where people signed</v>
<v Speaker 4>papers and okay,</v>

541
00:34:30.081 --> 00:34:35.081
<v Speaker 4>the next day as of tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Germany exists and the minute it </v>

542
00:34:35.081 --> 00:34:39.071
<v Speaker 4>existed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the most powerful land power in </v>

543
00:34:39.071 --> 00:34:41.330
<v Speaker 4>Europe with a larger population than </v>
<v Speaker 4>France.</v>

544
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:46.360
<v Speaker 4>Traditionally the greatest land power in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Europe up till this time period and a </v>

545
00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.160
<v Speaker 4>larger faster birth rate and more </v>
<v Speaker 4>industry,</v>

546
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:54.550
<v Speaker 4>and how destabilizing would it be in our</v>
<v Speaker 4>world today if a couple of different </v>

547
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:59.141
<v Speaker 4>nations of moderate power signed a piece</v>
<v Speaker 4>of paper tomorrow that united them into </v>

548
00:34:59.141 --> 00:35:01.850
<v Speaker 4>one country and that one now combined </v>
<v Speaker 4>country was the most powerful country in</v>

549
00:35:01.851 --> 00:35:02.420
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>

550
00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:08.260
<v Speaker 4>Even if it was just the most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 4>land power or the most powerful see </v>

551
00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:11.681
<v Speaker 4>power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see how a bunch of nations that </v>

552
00:35:11.681 --> 00:35:13.901
<v Speaker 4>really didn't deserve a lot of the perks</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the super great nations claim for </v>

553
00:35:13.901 --> 00:35:17.771
<v Speaker 4>themselves might all of a sudden do that</v>
<v Speaker 4>once they turn themselves into a super </v>

554
00:35:17.771 --> 00:35:20.210
<v Speaker 4>nation in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>71 with the creation of Germany,</v>

555
00:35:20.211 --> 00:35:20.990
<v Speaker 4>the Kaiser,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

556
00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:25.250
<v Speaker 4>You have an instant great power on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world stage.</v>

557
00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.880
<v Speaker 4>It was Prussia on steroids with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>population like eight times as much and </v>

558
00:35:32.031 --> 00:35:37.031
<v Speaker 4>the rest of Germany with the militarized</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the Prussian model with the Prussian </v>

559
00:35:37.031 --> 00:35:37.031
<v Speaker 4>King.</v>

560
00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:43.420
<v Speaker 4>That's a very destabilizing thing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>when that country begins to demand some </v>

561
00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.900
<v Speaker 4>of the perks that the other great powers</v>
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

562
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:46.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have their own France,</v>

563
00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:48.830
<v Speaker 4>Great Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've got all these colonies,</v>

564
00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:54.010
<v Speaker 4>all these other things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>little Holland to them looks like </v>

565
00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:54.830
<v Speaker 4>they've got places all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going on?</v>

566
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:58.480
<v Speaker 4>Sort of a factor of just having been </v>
<v Speaker 4>there for awhile.</v>

567
00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.700
<v Speaker 4>If you were around during the age of </v>
<v Speaker 4>exploration and you had a bunch of ships</v>

568
00:36:01.701 --> 00:36:03.200
<v Speaker 4>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were getting colonies.</v>

569
00:36:03.201 --> 00:36:06.200
<v Speaker 4>Germany didn't come around until most of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the good stuff was taken.</v>

570
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:11.030
<v Speaker 4>Was a cause of instability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Germany worried about being encircled.</v>

571
00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:14.840
<v Speaker 4>That powers all around them that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>wish them well.</v>

572
00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.310
<v Speaker 4>His Neil Ferguson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm in.</v>

573
00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:23.350
<v Speaker 4>The thing that I really thought was was </v>
<v Speaker 4>quite wonderful because here in the </v>

574
00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:24.230
<v Speaker 4>west,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those of us who fought the German empire</v>

575
00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.600
<v Speaker 4>famously said that they had this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>paranoia about being encircled.</v>

576
00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.180
<v Speaker 4>They were always worried about being </v>
<v Speaker 4>encircled.</v>

577
00:36:29.181 --> 00:36:34.181
<v Speaker 4>We'll look at them on a map.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're born in circle there in central </v>

578
00:36:34.181 --> 00:36:35.230
<v Speaker 4>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've got enemy is all around them.</v>

579
00:36:35.231 --> 00:36:38.940
<v Speaker 4>Neil Ferguson said they weren't paranoid</v>
<v Speaker 4>about being historical.</v>

580
00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:43.960
<v Speaker 4>They were being encircled and they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>worried about an upcoming war and up </v>

581
00:36:44.601 --> 00:36:48.080
<v Speaker 4>until Otto von Bismarck goes away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had neutralized Russia.</v>

582
00:36:48.081 --> 00:36:51.080
<v Speaker 4>That was one of the main things in his </v>
<v Speaker 4>diplomatic alliance system.</v>

583
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:55.460
<v Speaker 4>Keep the Russians happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said it in a five superpower world.</v>

584
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:58.220
<v Speaker 4>Make sure your country's one of three.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

585
00:36:58.221 --> 00:37:03.221
<v Speaker 4>So it's always three against two and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Russia was always to be kept on your </v>

586
00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:06.881
<v Speaker 4>good side when he was sacked and </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically the foreign policy begins to </v>

587
00:37:06.881 --> 00:37:09.350
<v Speaker 4>be heavily influenced by the German </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kaiser.</v>

588
00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.540
<v Speaker 4>The Emperor Kaiser Means Caesar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>

589
00:37:11.541 --> 00:37:16.340
<v Speaker 4>So imagine you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>calling your Emperor Caesar in 1914.</v>

590
00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:20.030
<v Speaker 4>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Kaiser was a strange guy.</v>

591
00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:25.330
<v Speaker 4>He sacks bismarck because bismarck's </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of talking down to him and is kind </v>

592
00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:28.871
<v Speaker 4>of running the show and he's an old guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>by then in these much revered and you </v>

593
00:37:28.871 --> 00:37:28.910
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you grow into your own man?</v>

594
00:37:28.911 --> 00:37:30.470
<v Speaker 4>Would that guy hanging over your </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoulder?</v>

595
00:37:30.471 --> 00:37:35.471
<v Speaker 4>So he fires him and he allows that </v>
<v Speaker 4>machine to make vital mistakes bismarck </v>

596
00:37:35.471 --> 00:37:36.020
<v Speaker 4>never would have made with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>diplomatic machine.</v>

597
00:37:36.021 --> 00:37:37.250
<v Speaker 4>Vital mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>number one,</v>

598
00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:42.700
<v Speaker 4>he lost the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He intentionally drove them away </v>

599
00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:43.220
<v Speaker 4>basically</v>

600
00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.320
<v Speaker 4>right into the hands of the French,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the historic German enemy,</v>

601
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.960
<v Speaker 4>the one that they had beaten in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Franco Prussian war in 18,</v>

602
00:37:50.961 --> 00:37:53.540
<v Speaker 4>78 slash 71.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That allowed them to proclaim the German</v>

603
00:37:53.541 --> 00:37:58.541
<v Speaker 4>empire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they did in the French palace of </v>

604
00:37:58.541 --> 00:38:01.151
<v Speaker 4>Versailles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is sort of a rub your nose in it </v>

605
00:38:01.151 --> 00:38:03.581
<v Speaker 4>kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Germans and the French assumed </v>

606
00:38:03.581 --> 00:38:07.361
<v Speaker 4>they'd fight each other again someday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the French were allied with the </v>

607
00:38:07.361 --> 00:38:10.580
<v Speaker 4>Russians and now the German fears of </v>
<v Speaker 4>encirclement had become a reality.</v>

608
00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.540
<v Speaker 4>The Germans had been trying to plan for </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're going to do with a war,</v>

609
00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:19.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>against an enemy to their west and </v>

610
00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:20.720
<v Speaker 4>another enemy to their east at the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

611
00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:21.950
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you do that?</v>

612
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:28.150
<v Speaker 4>And now the situation in Australia boils</v>
<v Speaker 4>over and the Austrian say to the </v>

613
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.610
<v Speaker 4>Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

614
00:38:28.611 --> 00:38:31.040
<v Speaker 4>if we get into a war with Serbia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Russia is going to attack us.</v>

615
00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.410
<v Speaker 4>If Russia attacks us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where do you stand?</v>

616
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:36.520
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is controversial,</v>

617
00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:40.780
<v Speaker 4>but traditionally the Kaiser is supposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have told the Austrians to go for it.</v>

618
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.950
<v Speaker 4>Get Serbia had done now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And some historians.</v>

619
00:38:44.951 --> 00:38:46.900
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is all very controversial.</v>

620
00:38:46.901 --> 00:38:48.680
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has a different opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

621
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:53.790
<v Speaker 4>but basically the idea seems to be that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Kaiser believed that if it was done </v>

622
00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:56.950
<v Speaker 4>quickly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Serbians could be crushed before the</v>

623
00:38:56.951 --> 00:39:01.951
<v Speaker 4>situation spiraled out of control in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Europe because even as moderately </v>

624
00:39:01.951 --> 00:39:02.770
<v Speaker 4>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll put,</v>

625
00:39:02.771 --> 00:39:04.420
<v Speaker 4>we'll give them some credit that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kaiser was,</v>

626
00:39:04.421 --> 00:39:09.421
<v Speaker 4>he knew that Europe was a powder keg and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the key thing that had to be avoided was</v>

627
00:39:10.031 --> 00:39:15.031
<v Speaker 4>this process almost a machine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cranking up of a doomsday device </v>

628
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.650
<v Speaker 4>that everybody who'd actually been </v>
<v Speaker 4>present when the thinkers who dealt with</v>

629
00:39:20.651 --> 00:39:23.320
<v Speaker 4>the Doomsday Device explained what the </v>
<v Speaker 4>doomsday device did,</v>

630
00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.350
<v Speaker 4>understood that once the trigger on this</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing was polled,</v>

631
00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.080
<v Speaker 4>it was going to be really hard to turn </v>
<v Speaker 4>it off.</v>

632
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:32.440
<v Speaker 4>So if the Austrians could conquer the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Serbians before the Russians,</v>

633
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flip the doomsday device switch,</v>

634
00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.390
<v Speaker 4>they would all be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

635
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:42.420
<v Speaker 4>a lot of controversy on this because </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is again another one of those </v>

636
00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.110
<v Speaker 4>places where the war guilt question </v>
<v Speaker 4>hinges.</v>

637
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:47.500
<v Speaker 4>Did Germany tell Austria to go crush </v>
<v Speaker 4>Serbia?</v>

638
00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:49.750
<v Speaker 4>And who cares if the Russians attack </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody?</v>

639
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:55.860
<v Speaker 4>But of course the problem wasn't that it</v>
<v Speaker 4>would just involve the Russians </v>

640
00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.760
<v Speaker 4>attacking everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because of that complex web of alliances</v>

641
00:39:57.761 --> 00:40:00.220
<v Speaker 4>we talked about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other countries,</v>

642
00:40:00.221 --> 00:40:02.110
<v Speaker 4>we're going to get dragged into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>conflict.</v>

643
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:07.530
<v Speaker 4>This was something that was well </v>
<v Speaker 4>understood by the intelligent heads of </v>

644
00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:07.870
<v Speaker 4>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take for example,</v>

645
00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:10.860
<v Speaker 4>the British prime minister.</v>
<v Speaker 4>During this time period,</v>

646
00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:15.880
<v Speaker 4>Herbert Asquith Asquith wrote a letter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a private lender that's coming down to </v>

647
00:40:17.411 --> 00:40:22.411
<v Speaker 4>the history books right after Serbia </v>
<v Speaker 4>receives the ultimatum from Austria </v>

648
00:40:22.411 --> 00:40:25.210
<v Speaker 4>that's so important and ask with writes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

649
00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:30.690
<v Speaker 4>Austria has sent a bullying and </v>
<v Speaker 4>humiliating ultimatum to Serbia who </v>

650
00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:34.801
<v Speaker 4>cannot possibly comply with it and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>demanded an answer within 48 hours </v>

651
00:40:34.801 --> 00:40:36.580
<v Speaker 4>failing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which she will march.</v>

652
00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:41.820
<v Speaker 4>This means almost inevitably that Russia</v>
<v Speaker 4>will come to the scene and defensive </v>

653
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.540
<v Speaker 4>Serbia and in defiance of Austria,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if so,</v>

654
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:48.750
<v Speaker 4>it's difficult for Germany and France to</v>
<v Speaker 4>refrain from lending a hand to one side </v>

655
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:52.441
<v Speaker 4>or the other so that we are in </v>
<v Speaker 4>measurable or imaginable distance of a </v>

656
00:40:52.441 --> 00:40:53.650
<v Speaker 4>real armageddon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Happily,</v>

657
00:40:53.651 --> 00:40:58.651
<v Speaker 4>there seems to be no reason why we </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be anything more than spectators </v>

658
00:40:58.651 --> 00:40:59.140
<v Speaker 4>and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

659
00:40:59.141 --> 00:41:04.141
<v Speaker 4>that turned out obviously to be wishful </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking on the British prime ministers </v>

660
00:41:04.141 --> 00:41:08.041
<v Speaker 4>part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but historians like Neil Ferguson who </v>

661
00:41:08.041 --> 00:41:08.041
<v Speaker 4>write revisionist works like the pity of</v>
<v Speaker 4>war,</v>

662
00:41:08.041 --> 00:41:09.520
<v Speaker 4>have suggested that if the British had </v>
<v Speaker 4>stayed out,</v>

663
00:41:09.521 --> 00:41:12.430
<v Speaker 4>we'd have a better world today for all </v>
<v Speaker 4>sorts of reasons.</v>

664
00:41:12.431 --> 00:41:14.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knocks off many of the biggest events</v>

665
00:41:14.831 --> 00:41:19.831
<v Speaker 4>of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The most horrible saying this never </v>

666
00:41:19.831 --> 00:41:19.831
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That never happens.</v>

667
00:41:19.831 --> 00:41:19.930
<v Speaker 4>That never happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If Britain stays out of the war,</v>

668
00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:25.330
<v Speaker 4>Britain can stay out of the work as they</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have a hard alliance with anyone.</v>

669
00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:28.870
<v Speaker 4>They're not caught up in that web of </v>
<v Speaker 4>alliances will not too much.</v>

670
00:41:28.871 --> 00:41:33.871
<v Speaker 4>They have an understanding with France </v>
<v Speaker 4>and understanding with enough wiggle </v>

671
00:41:33.871 --> 00:41:37.771
<v Speaker 4>room so that there was a lot of talk in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Britain about do we or don't we get </v>

672
00:41:37.771 --> 00:41:41.411
<v Speaker 4>involved in this whole thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This whole thing was something that </v>

673
00:41:41.411 --> 00:41:43.730
<v Speaker 4>hadn't happened in a hundred years in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Europe,</v>

674
00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:48.970
<v Speaker 4>a general European war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It hadn't happened since Napoleon,</v>

675
00:41:49.671 --> 00:41:54.500
<v Speaker 4>since Waterloo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that war was so terrible.</v>

676
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:59.710
<v Speaker 4>Not just that we're the entire </v>
<v Speaker 4>Napoleonic wars and the wars of the </v>

677
00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:01.340
<v Speaker 4>French revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That era from like 1789 to 1815,</v>

678
00:42:01.341 --> 00:42:06.341
<v Speaker 4>so awful in terms of military </v>
<v Speaker 4>destruction that a lesson had been </v>

679
00:42:06.341 --> 00:42:07.640
<v Speaker 4>talked to the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

680
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:09.620
<v Speaker 4>crown heads of Europe and the lesson </v>
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

681
00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:14.210
<v Speaker 4>was not as much of a game anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's no longer,</v>

682
00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:19.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these small private armies that we move </v>

683
00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:21.491
<v Speaker 4>around our European Chessboard and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I lost to you so you can have this </v>

684
00:42:21.491 --> 00:42:22.700
<v Speaker 4>province and then on next time I'll beat</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and I'll take that province back.</v>

685
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:27.700
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody was trying to topple over their </v>

686
00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:27.700
<v Speaker 4>regimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

687
00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:28.790
<v Speaker 4>if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gentlemanly warfare,</v>

688
00:42:28.791 --> 00:42:32.630
<v Speaker 4>if there's ever been such a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been called in the history books,</v>

689
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:37.990
<v Speaker 4>limited warfare or restricted warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was an Italian historian named </v>

690
00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:43.100
<v Speaker 4>Ferraro 1933 who talked about how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

691
00:42:43.191 --> 00:42:46.700
<v Speaker 4>that era of warfare was the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>warfare where you know,</v>

692
00:42:46.701 --> 00:42:48.740
<v Speaker 4>the leaders of countries can actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>have fun.</v>

693
00:42:48.741 --> 00:42:50.960
<v Speaker 4>Going to war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>War was something you just sort of did,</v>

694
00:42:50.961 --> 00:42:55.961
<v Speaker 4>like pheasant hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least in the minds of some of these </v>

695
00:42:55.961 --> 00:42:56.300
<v Speaker 4>guys I'm Ferrara writes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

696
00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.960
<v Speaker 4>restricted warfare was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>loftiest achievements of the 18th </v>

697
00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.831
<v Speaker 4>century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It belongs to a class of hothouse </v>

698
00:43:05.831 --> 00:43:06.860
<v Speaker 4>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which can only thrive in an aristocratic</v>

699
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:10.670
<v Speaker 4>and qualitative civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are no longer capable of it.</v>

700
00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:15.880
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the things we have lost as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>result of the French revolution and the </v>

701
00:43:17.511 --> 00:43:22.220
<v Speaker 4>French Revolution was when warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

702
00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:25.580
<v Speaker 4>at least in the minds of the Europeans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have this era,</v>

703
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really serious,</v>

704
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:30.530
<v Speaker 4>you want a war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then we're going to go to war.</v>

705
00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:35.270
<v Speaker 4>The crown heads of Europe attack France </v>
<v Speaker 4>after France went all revolutionary,</v>

706
00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.480
<v Speaker 4>and you have to understand how much of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>shock that was.</v>

707
00:43:38.481 --> 00:43:41.150
<v Speaker 4>Historian Gwynne Dyer has a great way of</v>
<v Speaker 4>describing it.</v>

708
00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:46.151
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to understand the shock of the crown </v>

709
00:43:46.151 --> 00:43:46.400
<v Speaker 4>heads of Europe when the most royal of </v>
<v Speaker 4>European countries,</v>

710
00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:50.150
<v Speaker 4>the French were overthrown by leftist </v>
<v Speaker 4>revolutionaries.</v>

711
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:55.450
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to imagine if Maoists toppled </v>

712
00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:56.810
<v Speaker 4>the US government today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maoist of course,</v>

713
00:43:56.811 --> 00:44:01.811
<v Speaker 4>being a very hardcore communist group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine them toppling today's US </v>

714
00:44:01.811 --> 00:44:02.600
<v Speaker 4>government and beginning to govern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

715
00:44:02.601 --> 00:44:05.390
<v Speaker 4>that's how the crown heads of Europe </v>
<v Speaker 4>felt about the French revolution and how</v>

716
00:44:05.391 --> 00:44:08.450
<v Speaker 4>destabilizing it was seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So inevitably,</v>

717
00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:11.590
<v Speaker 4>the royalty of Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is almost all of Europe,</v>

718
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.600
<v Speaker 4>clashes with this new republic in France</v>
<v Speaker 4>and coalesces into an alliance and </v>

719
00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:22.360
<v Speaker 4>everybody attacks France and they do so </v>
<v Speaker 4>with their private mercenary armies and </v>

720
00:44:22.731 --> 00:44:27.230
<v Speaker 4>they run into the entire French </v>
<v Speaker 4>population,</v>

721
00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:32.620
<v Speaker 4>a people in arms because France started </v>
<v Speaker 4>by losing.</v>

722
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:37.640
<v Speaker 4>You have to imagine a state where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>entire underpinnings of the state have </v>

723
00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 4>been broken down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including especially the army.</v>

724
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:42.090
<v Speaker 4>And then all I mean pressure rush </v>
<v Speaker 4>Australia and Great Britain.</v>

725
00:44:42.091 --> 00:44:45.720
<v Speaker 4>All these powers in Europe attack France</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the same time and you're stuck with.</v>

726
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:49.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean like a bit of your army leftover.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The artillery stayed with the people.</v>

727
00:44:49.981 --> 00:44:54.981
<v Speaker 4>So the old French artillery was good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you've got this mishmash of an army </v>

728
00:44:54.981 --> 00:44:55.080
<v Speaker 4>with officers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have any authority.</v>

729
00:44:55.081 --> 00:44:57.900
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And France is about to be defeated.</v>

730
00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:02.550
<v Speaker 4>And then as only you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totalitarian regimes can do,</v>

731
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:07.970
<v Speaker 4>they basically tell the people of France</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the war is now everything.</v>

732
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:13.250
<v Speaker 4>Our entire focus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire society exists only to win </v>

733
00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:18.111
<v Speaker 4>this war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The decree of the French national </v>

734
00:45:18.111 --> 00:45:19.020
<v Speaker 4>convention in Seventeen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>93 said,</v>

735
00:45:19.021 --> 00:45:24.021
<v Speaker 4>quote from this moment until that in </v>
<v Speaker 4>which our enemies shall have been driven</v>

736
00:45:24.151 --> 00:45:25.800
<v Speaker 4>from the territory of the republic.</v>

737
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:29.520
<v Speaker 4>All Frenchmen are permanently </v>
<v Speaker 4>requisition for service in the army's.</v>

738
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:34.790
<v Speaker 4>The young men shall fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The married men shall forge weapons and </v>

739
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:38.301
<v Speaker 4>transport supplies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The women will make tents and clothes </v>

740
00:45:38.301 --> 00:45:41.781
<v Speaker 4>and serve in the hospitals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The public buildings shall be turned </v>

741
00:45:41.781 --> 00:45:44.901
<v Speaker 4>into barracks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the public squares into munition </v>

742
00:45:44.901 --> 00:45:45.810
<v Speaker 4>factories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All firearms have suitable caliber,</v>

743
00:45:45.811 --> 00:45:50.811
<v Speaker 4>shall be turned over to the troops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The interior will be policed with </v>

744
00:45:50.811 --> 00:45:54.021
<v Speaker 4>shotguns and cold steel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All saddled horses shall be seized for </v>

745
00:45:54.021 --> 00:45:58.221
<v Speaker 4>the cavalry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All draft horses not employed in </v>

746
00:45:58.221 --> 00:46:00.450
<v Speaker 4>cultivation will draw the artillery and </v>
<v Speaker 4>supply wagons and quote.</v>

747
00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:05.280
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire society was mobilized for the</v>

748
00:46:05.281 --> 00:46:10.281
<v Speaker 4>war effort.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was not something that the other </v>

749
00:46:10.281 --> 00:46:10.281
<v Speaker 4>countries did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

750
00:46:10.281 --> 00:46:10.281
<v Speaker 4>most of the royal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

751
00:46:10.281 --> 00:46:15.021
<v Speaker 4>leaders of Europe could think of nothing</v>
<v Speaker 4>more scary than arming and training your</v>

752
00:46:15.121 --> 00:46:17.520
<v Speaker 4>population.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oftentimes,</v>

753
00:46:17.521 --> 00:46:22.521
<v Speaker 4>they used their professional militaries </v>
<v Speaker 4>to put down rebellions by their </v>

754
00:46:22.521 --> 00:46:22.560
<v Speaker 4>population.</v>

755
00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.410
<v Speaker 4>The last thing they wanted to do was </v>
<v Speaker 4>give them guns and train them how to use</v>

756
00:46:25.411 --> 00:46:25.670
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

757
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.890
<v Speaker 4>Train them how to be better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Street fighters wasn't going to happen,</v>

758
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:31.320
<v Speaker 4>but the French had a different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>society,</v>

759
00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:33.510
<v Speaker 4>one that was supposed to be run by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

760
00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:35.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>low born people.</v>

761
00:46:35.071 --> 00:46:40.071
<v Speaker 4>Everybody was in this together and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>combine the willingness to throw human </v>

762
00:46:40.071 --> 00:46:40.770
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

763
00:46:40.771 --> 00:46:43.800
<v Speaker 4>out there on the battlefield in almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>endless numbers.</v>

764
00:46:43.801 --> 00:46:45.300
<v Speaker 4>You didn't have to pay these people </v>
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>

765
00:46:45.301 --> 00:46:47.550
<v Speaker 4>You could just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry you're out of work right now.</v>

766
00:46:47.551 --> 00:46:49.370
<v Speaker 4>You're going to the front and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

767
00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:54.440
<v Speaker 4>steal some chickens from some farmer on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the way this was crazy and all of a </v>

768
00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:59.301
<v Speaker 4>sudden the French were able to expend </v>
<v Speaker 4>lives on a scale that was unprecedented.</v>

769
00:47:00.691 --> 00:47:03.450
<v Speaker 4>And to create armies that were enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

770
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:08.690
<v Speaker 4>look at Alexander the Great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably the greatest conqueror in all </v>

771
00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:08.690
<v Speaker 4>world history.</v>

772
00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:13.940
<v Speaker 4>Alexander conquers a very large chunk of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the known world and a decent sized chunk</v>

773
00:47:13.951 --> 00:47:18.951
<v Speaker 4>of the unknown world at the time with an</v>
<v Speaker 4>army that numbered anywhere from 40 to </v>

774
00:47:19.411 --> 00:47:20.700
<v Speaker 4>90,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>men.</v>

775
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.310
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was obviously a genius in the way</v>

776
00:47:23.311 --> 00:47:27.510
<v Speaker 4>he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but imagine if Alexander could have used</v>

777
00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:32.511
<v Speaker 4>a historical xerox machine to duplicate </v>
<v Speaker 4>that world conquering army so that now </v>

778
00:47:33.611 --> 00:47:36.480
<v Speaker 4>he's got 2:40</v>
<v Speaker 4>to $90,000,</v>

779
00:47:36.481 --> 00:47:38.620
<v Speaker 4>man armies roughly comparable to each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

780
00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:43.240
<v Speaker 4>Now imagine he does it again and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>duplicate it again.</v>

781
00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.610
<v Speaker 4>And then again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then again,</v>

782
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.990
<v Speaker 4>you do that enough times to where you </v>
<v Speaker 4>got one point two,</v>

783
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:52.480
<v Speaker 4>one point three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one point 5 million men,</v>

784
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:54.820
<v Speaker 4>maybe eventually closer to 3 million </v>
<v Speaker 4>men.</v>

785
00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:59.620
<v Speaker 4>And now you've given Alexander the Great</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twentieth Century Army,</v>

786
00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:03.690
<v Speaker 4>a 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Army is many,</v>

787
00:48:03.691 --> 00:48:08.691
<v Speaker 4>many armies from the past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The French revolution is when that </v>

788
00:48:09.881 --> 00:48:14.881
<v Speaker 4>really starts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you start putting so many troops </v>

789
00:48:14.881 --> 00:48:18.430
<v Speaker 4>into the field that it doesn't matter </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there are practically incompetent,</v>

790
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:23.640
<v Speaker 4>that their lives are wasted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're turned into cannon fodder </v>

791
00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:24.220
<v Speaker 4>as Napoleon who will inherit this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

792
00:48:24.221 --> 00:48:29.221
<v Speaker 4>people's army that will conscript every </v>
<v Speaker 4>man they want to conscript as long as </v>

793
00:48:29.221 --> 00:48:31.990
<v Speaker 4>they need them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll say troops are born to be killed.</v>

794
00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:36.970
<v Speaker 4>And as Napoleon famously said to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Austrian diplomat,</v>

795
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:38.080
<v Speaker 4>count,</v>
<v Speaker 4>medtronic,</v>

796
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.380
<v Speaker 4>you cannot stop me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I spend 30,000</v>

797
00:48:41.381 --> 00:48:42.250
<v Speaker 4>lives a month,</v>

798
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:48.160
<v Speaker 4>if any of the major powers except maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>Russia in Europe at this time,</v>

799
00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:51.090
<v Speaker 4>last 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>men in a month,</v>

800
00:48:51.091 --> 00:48:54.820
<v Speaker 4>it would be considered quite a blow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Napoleon lost 30,000</v>

801
00:48:54.821 --> 00:48:56.800
<v Speaker 4>men a month as a matter of course,</v>

802
00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:03.580
<v Speaker 4>because he had a new kind of army.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had a people in arms and in order to </v>

803
00:49:05.001 --> 00:49:10.001
<v Speaker 4>beat him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other countries of Europe had to do </v>

804
00:49:10.001 --> 00:49:12.900
<v Speaker 4>the same thing as the German field.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marshal,</v>

805
00:49:12.901 --> 00:49:17.901
<v Speaker 4>blue shirt told the PRUSSIAN government </v>
<v Speaker 4>after the Russians had been defeated by </v>

806
00:49:18.051 --> 00:49:20.210
<v Speaker 4>Napoleon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give me a national army,</v>

807
00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:26.080
<v Speaker 4>gave me what he has and when he got it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know which the Russian aristocracy </v>

808
00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:30.551
<v Speaker 4>didn't want to do for the same reason </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the European leaders everywhere </v>

809
00:49:30.551 --> 00:49:33.041
<v Speaker 4>didn't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They didn't want to put the people in </v>

810
00:49:33.041 --> 00:49:33.041
<v Speaker 4>arms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when they did,</v>

811
00:49:33.041 --> 00:49:36.191
<v Speaker 4>they were able to triple the size of </v>
<v Speaker 4>blue shirts army and he took that army </v>

812
00:49:36.191 --> 00:49:39.101
<v Speaker 4>and fought Napoleon with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The creation of a nation in arms was the</v>

813
00:49:39.881 --> 00:49:44.881
<v Speaker 4>first step in creating the modern war </v>
<v Speaker 4>machine because now all of a sudden life</v>

814
00:49:44.891 --> 00:49:45.790
<v Speaker 4>was cheap.</v>

815
00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:52.870
<v Speaker 4>Not only was life cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the modern nation state was now deep</v>

816
00:49:53.451 --> 00:49:58.451
<v Speaker 4>enough to be able to truly take a punch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is what sets the modern </v>

817
00:49:59.481 --> 00:50:03.320
<v Speaker 4>militaries off in the modern states,</v>
<v Speaker 4>off from the ones in ancient times.</v>

818
00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:07.460
<v Speaker 4>In ancient times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very few states could take a punch,</v>

819
00:50:07.461 --> 00:50:08.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to use a boxing term.</v>

820
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:13.930
<v Speaker 4>Many of them could dish it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you take a state like the acumen </v>

821
00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.800
<v Speaker 4>had Persians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the ones who fought the </v>

822
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.461
<v Speaker 4>spartans at thermopylae and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Persians Kodesh out really good </v>

823
00:50:18.461 --> 00:50:22.151
<v Speaker 4>blows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they couldn't take very many good </v>

824
00:50:22.151 --> 00:50:22.151
<v Speaker 4>blows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most nations in the past couldn't.</v>

825
00:50:22.151 --> 00:50:26.530
<v Speaker 4>That's why if you look at a book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know the greatest battles in </v>

826
00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:26.530
<v Speaker 4>history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's beyond,</v>

827
00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:30.740
<v Speaker 4>you know about 150 ago sometimes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>great battle is the only battle the wars</v>

828
00:50:30.741 --> 00:50:35.741
<v Speaker 4>are won or lost on one big battle </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the nation states couldn't take </v>

829
00:50:35.741 --> 00:50:35.741
<v Speaker 4>too many punches.</v>

830
00:50:35.741 --> 00:50:37.850
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't reraise armies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The state just couldn't support it.</v>

831
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:42.200
<v Speaker 4>Once France turns the entire nation into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the war,</v>

832
00:50:42.201 --> 00:50:44.570
<v Speaker 4>effort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nations can take punches better.</v>

833
00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:49.580
<v Speaker 4>And in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the goals and the Chinese could </v>

834
00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:50.150
<v Speaker 4>take some punches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Roman Empire could take punches.</v>

835
00:50:50.151 --> 00:50:52.760
<v Speaker 4>That's what set those nation states in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the past,</v>

836
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.010
<v Speaker 4>apart from most of their enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

837
00:50:55.011 --> 00:50:56.750
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had more staying power.</v>

838
00:50:56.810 --> 00:51:01.810
<v Speaker 4>They had modern staying power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The French Revolution teaches all these </v>

839
00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:05.711
<v Speaker 4>states to have modern staying power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only problem with modern staying </v>

840
00:51:05.711 --> 00:51:07.250
<v Speaker 4>power is that the killing can go on </v>
<v Speaker 4>longer.</v>

841
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:12.490
<v Speaker 4>In boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they always feel like an early knockout </v>

842
00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:15.251
<v Speaker 4>is more merciful than a long match.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because in a long match you take a lot </v>

843
00:51:15.251 --> 00:51:15.260
<v Speaker 4>more punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

844
00:51:15.261 --> 00:51:20.261
<v Speaker 4>in a funny way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if everything can be decided at one big </v>

845
00:51:20.261 --> 00:51:20.261
<v Speaker 4>horrific battle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

846
00:51:20.261 --> 00:51:24.401
<v Speaker 4>at the start of a war that has a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>less costly over time than a four or a </v>

847
00:51:24.401 --> 00:51:28.280
<v Speaker 4>five year long conflict where both sides</v>
<v Speaker 4>grind each other.</v>

848
00:51:28.281 --> 00:51:33.281
<v Speaker 4>Down to the NUB.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Napoleonic wars created multiple </v>

849
00:51:33.291 --> 00:51:37.850
<v Speaker 4>states in Europe capable of fighting </v>
<v Speaker 4>until they were ground down to the NUB,</v>

850
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:40.460
<v Speaker 4>which meant a lot more damage and </v>
<v Speaker 4>destruction.</v>

851
00:51:40.461 --> 00:51:42.230
<v Speaker 4>Before these wars came to a halt.</v>

852
00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:49.330
<v Speaker 4>The modern nation state provided the </v>
<v Speaker 4>support that the militaries that </v>

853
00:51:50.271 --> 00:51:54.950
<v Speaker 4>involved entire peoples in arms needed </v>
<v Speaker 4>to keep the struggle going,</v>

854
00:51:55.410 --> 00:51:57.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for long periods of time,</v>

855
00:51:57.201 --> 00:52:01.130
<v Speaker 4>one half of the equation necessary to </v>
<v Speaker 4>create the modern war machines.</v>

856
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:06.790
<v Speaker 4>As military historian Gwynne dyer rights</v>
<v Speaker 4>right after he talks about the human </v>

857
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:06.790
<v Speaker 4>costs of these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

858
00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:08.090
<v Speaker 4>Long Napoleonic wars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

859
00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:13.091
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost as important is the fact that </v>

860
00:52:13.091 --> 00:52:14.720
<v Speaker 4>European society did not break down </v>
<v Speaker 4>under the strain.</v>

861
00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:18.500
<v Speaker 4>There was hardship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no starvation and the warring powers</v>

862
00:52:18.501 --> 00:52:23.270
<v Speaker 4>were able to keep at it and keep their </v>
<v Speaker 4>people at it year after year with no end</v>

863
00:52:23.271 --> 00:52:28.271
<v Speaker 4>in sight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The European states had developed the </v>

864
00:52:28.271 --> 00:52:30.881
<v Speaker 4>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the organizational techniques and the </v>

865
00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:33.491
<v Speaker 4>methods of motivation needed to fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>mass wars with a degree of popular </v>

866
00:52:33.491 --> 00:52:37.730
<v Speaker 4>participation that no other civilized </v>
<v Speaker 4>society had ever even approached.</v>

867
00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:41.840
<v Speaker 4>All that was lacking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He writes to transform mass warfare into</v>

868
00:52:41.841 --> 00:52:46.841
<v Speaker 4>total war was the technology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the industrial revolution was </v>

869
00:52:46.841 --> 00:52:50.981
<v Speaker 4>already almost a generation old and 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>14 and soon it would begin to fill the </v>

870
00:52:50.981 --> 00:52:55.871
<v Speaker 4>last remaining gap and to quote what was</v>
<v Speaker 4>missing to make this new deadly machine </v>

871
00:52:58.191 --> 00:53:03.020
<v Speaker 4>that the Napoleonic wars and the French </v>
<v Speaker 4>revolution created was the technology to</v>

872
00:53:03.021 --> 00:53:08.021
<v Speaker 4>increase the deadliness by exponential </v>
<v Speaker 4>amounts and that was already something </v>

873
00:53:08.781 --> 00:53:09.470
<v Speaker 4>that was happening.</v>

874
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:14.470
<v Speaker 4>The 18 hundreds are an era in military </v>
<v Speaker 4>history where the killing power of </v>

875
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:18.521
<v Speaker 4>machines skyrockets and machines have </v>
<v Speaker 4>been an important part of battlefields </v>

876
00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:25.240
<v Speaker 4>since before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were cities in human societies to </v>

877
00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.070
<v Speaker 4>field mass armies at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think of the bow and Arrow,</v>

878
00:53:26.430 --> 00:53:31.110
<v Speaker 4>that's a neolithic weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a stone age machine that made man</v>

879
00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:35.760
<v Speaker 4>a more efficient killer both in hunting </v>
<v Speaker 4>but on the battlefield as well.</v>

880
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:39.510
<v Speaker 4>By the time the 18 hundreds roll around </v>
<v Speaker 4>the machines,</v>

881
00:53:39.511 --> 00:53:41.430
<v Speaker 4>killing power skyrockets,</v>

882
00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:48.760
<v Speaker 4>but because there is no major war </v>
<v Speaker 4>involving all the great powers between </v>

883
00:53:49.281 --> 00:53:54.281
<v Speaker 4>Napoleon and the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the actual demonstration of how this </v>

884
00:53:54.381 --> 00:53:59.381
<v Speaker 4>stuff can be used is lacking and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>military powers of the world.</v>

885
00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:05.590
<v Speaker 4>Try to examine the conflicts that do </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen to see if they can learn any </v>

886
00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:08.240
<v Speaker 4>lessons about what the next war is </v>
<v Speaker 4>likely to be like.</v>

887
00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:11.780
<v Speaker 4>There were European observers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

888
00:54:11.781 --> 00:54:14.120
<v Speaker 4>at the American civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to try to see,</v>

889
00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you could learn from that.</v>

890
00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:22.060
<v Speaker 4>The Crimean war breaks out in the 18 </v>
<v Speaker 4>fifties between Russia and Britain and </v>

891
00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:26.111
<v Speaker 4>France.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a war obviously between the </v>

892
00:54:26.111 --> 00:54:29.290
<v Speaker 4>United States and Spain that involve </v>
<v Speaker 4>Cuba and the Philippines in,</v>

893
00:54:29.291 --> 00:54:34.291
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right around the turn of the century </v>

894
00:54:34.291 --> 00:54:34.360
<v Speaker 4>going into the 19 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably most importantly,</v>

895
00:54:34.570 --> 00:54:39.570
<v Speaker 4>there's a war between Japan and Russia </v>
<v Speaker 4>in 1905 where some of the use of these,</v>

896
00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:45.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new weapons that when fused together </v>

897
00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.740
<v Speaker 4>create the modern war machine where some</v>
<v Speaker 4>of that was observable.</v>

898
00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:54.600
<v Speaker 4>The one thing that seems to be the key </v>
<v Speaker 4>element as far as European planners can </v>

899
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:59.481
<v Speaker 4>figure it out though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is something that Harkens back to a </v>

900
00:54:59.481 --> 00:55:02.971
<v Speaker 4>phrase from a confederate general in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>US civil war who said that the key to </v>

901
00:55:02.971 --> 00:55:07.210
<v Speaker 4>warfare was to get their firstest with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the mostest.</v>

902
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:12.990
<v Speaker 4>And the idea now of these mass armies </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're a peg created was that you </v>

903
00:55:14.201 --> 00:55:19.201
<v Speaker 4>needed to be able to raise them and get </v>
<v Speaker 4>them to the battlefield before the other</v>

904
00:55:19.961 --> 00:55:24.961
<v Speaker 4>side beat you to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The timetable for mobilization becomes a</v>

905
00:55:26.801 --> 00:55:31.801
<v Speaker 4>force that none of the major European </v>
<v Speaker 4>powers seem to be anything but a slave </v>

906
00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:37.050
<v Speaker 4>to once the assassin's bullet in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sarajevo cuts down the Austrian </v>

907
00:55:37.151 --> 00:55:37.840
<v Speaker 4>archduke.</v>

908
00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:42.250
<v Speaker 4>When the archduke is killed by </v>
<v Speaker 4>principal,</v>

909
00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:46.300
<v Speaker 4>he does the equivalent of pulling a pan </v>
<v Speaker 4>on a hand grenade.</v>

910
00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:52.290
<v Speaker 4>Imagine trying to hold negotiations to </v>
<v Speaker 4>ward off an explosion with a guy who's </v>

911
00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:55.150
<v Speaker 4>already pulled the pin on the grenade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

912
00:55:55.151 --> 00:55:58.090
<v Speaker 4>You have a limited amount of time to </v>
<v Speaker 4>convince them of anything.</v>

913
00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:03.330
<v Speaker 4>Winston Churchill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>during his life had famously said that </v>

914
00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:05.350
<v Speaker 4>jaw jaw was better than war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>War,</v>

915
00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:07.450
<v Speaker 4>meaning negotiation is always better </v>
<v Speaker 4>than war,</v>

916
00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:11.260
<v Speaker 4>but at the person's already pulled the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pin on the hand grenade.</v>

917
00:56:11.261 --> 00:56:15.280
<v Speaker 4>You have a very short window of </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity to avoid the inevitable.</v>

918
00:56:15.281 --> 00:56:18.790
<v Speaker 4>And that's where Europe finds itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After the archduke is murdered.</v>

919
00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:21.810
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's worried about the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

920
00:56:21.811 --> 00:56:26.811
<v Speaker 4>There's an old phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the peace movement used to use in the </v>

921
00:56:26.811 --> 00:56:27.940
<v Speaker 4>late 19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>early 19 seventies where they would say,</v>

922
00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:32.880
<v Speaker 4>what if they gave a war and nobody came?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

923
00:56:32.881 --> 00:56:35.950
<v Speaker 4>the military planners in Europe at this </v>
<v Speaker 4>time period or worried about something a</v>

924
00:56:35.951 --> 00:56:40.951
<v Speaker 4>little bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if war breaks out and on the days </v>

925
00:56:40.951 --> 00:56:44.080
<v Speaker 4>that hostilities commence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>only one side's got their army there.</v>

926
00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:50.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it takes you 30 days to get your </v>

927
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:52.080
<v Speaker 4>reservists in uniform to the mustering </v>
<v Speaker 4>point,</v>

928
00:56:52.081 --> 00:56:54.020
<v Speaker 4>into the battlefield before they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>ready to fight,</v>

929
00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:59.770
<v Speaker 4>how big of a deal is it if it only takes</v>
<v Speaker 4>your opponent 15 days to do the same </v>

930
00:56:59.770 --> 00:57:04.070
<v Speaker 4>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This puts a huge crunch,</v>

931
00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:09.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>timewise on everybody in this story and </v>

932
00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:10.460
<v Speaker 4>constrains the ability to negotiate your</v>
<v Speaker 4>way out of this situation.</v>

933
00:57:10.461 --> 00:57:12.170
<v Speaker 4>Everybody feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

934
00:57:12.171 --> 00:57:14.630
<v Speaker 4>the first person that flips the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mobilization switch,</v>

935
00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:17.150
<v Speaker 4>we all go because nobody wants to fall </v>
<v Speaker 4>behind.</v>

936
00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:21.440
<v Speaker 4>The Germans have constrained themselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>even more timewise by the way,</v>

937
00:57:21.441 --> 00:57:26.441
<v Speaker 4>that they have found a solution to their</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible dilemma of how do you fight a </v>

938
00:57:26.751 --> 00:57:29.090
<v Speaker 4>two front war?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

939
00:57:29.091 --> 00:57:32.090
<v Speaker 4>once you violate bismark's dictum of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

940
00:57:32.091 --> 00:57:37.091
<v Speaker 4>keep the Russians on your side and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Russians and the French ally with </v>

941
00:57:37.091 --> 00:57:40.391
<v Speaker 4>each other and war breaks out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to be fighting the French </v>

942
00:57:40.391 --> 00:57:40.391
<v Speaker 4>and the West and the Russians and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>east at the same time</v>

943
00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:47.320
<v Speaker 4>and in the intervening decades,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fantastic German general staff had </v>

944
00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:51.530
<v Speaker 4>figured out a way to not just survive </v>
<v Speaker 4>that situation but to win that war.</v>

945
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:57.190
<v Speaker 4>But it involved exquisite timing which </v>
<v Speaker 4>further constrained the amount of </v>

946
00:57:58.131 --> 00:58:00.770
<v Speaker 4>negotiation room you had before the </v>
<v Speaker 4>grenade went off.</v>

947
00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:06.130
<v Speaker 4>The timing involved taking advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that everyone thought the </v>

948
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:07.340
<v Speaker 4>Russians were going to take forever to </v>
<v Speaker 4>mobilize.</v>

949
00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:12.140
<v Speaker 4>The Russians were seen as a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhat clumsy colossus,</v>

950
00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:15.530
<v Speaker 4>less organized than the Germans and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>French and people like that.</v>

951
00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:20.800
<v Speaker 4>And so by the time the Russians could </v>
<v Speaker 4>get their act together and get their </v>

952
00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:21.530
<v Speaker 4>monstrous armies in the field ready to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>

953
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:24.650
<v Speaker 4>Germany already would have defeated </v>
<v Speaker 4>France.</v>

954
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:29.870
<v Speaker 4>Their entire plan for action involved </v>
<v Speaker 4>throwing almost all their weight against</v>

955
00:58:29.871 --> 00:58:34.871
<v Speaker 4>the French immediately and then turning </v>
<v Speaker 4>after French forces were defeated and </v>

956
00:58:34.871 --> 00:58:37.520
<v Speaker 4>throwing those forces against the now </v>
<v Speaker 4>ready to fight Russians,</v>

957
00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:42.620
<v Speaker 4>but this did two things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the Germans one,</v>

958
00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:45.650
<v Speaker 4>it meant the Russians could have no </v>
<v Speaker 4>advanced time mobilizing.</v>

959
00:58:45.651 --> 00:58:50.651
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't let them mobilize for three</v>
<v Speaker 4>or four days while you waited to </v>

960
00:58:50.651 --> 00:58:51.770
<v Speaker 4>negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting the pin back in the grenade.</v>

961
00:58:51.771 --> 00:58:56.771
<v Speaker 4>You didn't have that kind of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were going to screw up your entire </v>

962
00:58:56.771 --> 00:58:56.780
<v Speaker 4>plan for winning the war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you did that.</v>

963
00:58:57.260 --> 00:59:00.200
<v Speaker 4>The other thing that it meant is that if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you went to war with Russia,</v>

964
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:05.710
<v Speaker 4>you had to attack France.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had to assume that the French would </v>

965
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:09.401
<v Speaker 4>come in at some time and the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>you had a plan to deal with was to </v>

966
00:59:09.401 --> 00:59:10.310
<v Speaker 4>attack the French first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you go into war with Russia,</v>

967
00:59:10.311 --> 00:59:12.500
<v Speaker 4>you get to attack France as part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bargain,</v>

968
00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:16.900
<v Speaker 4>but it was even more of a concern than </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

969
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:20.710
<v Speaker 4>It involved attacking countries besides </v>
<v Speaker 4>France.</v>

970
00:59:20.711 --> 00:59:21.830
<v Speaker 4>Countries had no</v>

971
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.070
<v Speaker 2>disagreement with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All neutral countries.</v>

972
00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:30.820
<v Speaker 2>That just happened to be in the way the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germans had come up with a plan to deal </v>

973
00:59:32.021 --> 00:59:37.021
<v Speaker 2>with their encirclement problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it involved launching essentially a </v>

974
00:59:37.021 --> 00:59:42.001
<v Speaker 2>world war in their own defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that prince did was </v>

975
00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:48.530
<v Speaker 2>provide an opportunity for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these leaders who thought war was coming</v>

976
00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:53.030
<v Speaker 2>anyway to decide that now was better </v>
<v Speaker 2>than later,</v>

977
00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:55.610
<v Speaker 2>and this is another interesting side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the conflict,</v>

978
00:59:55.611 --> 00:59:59.760
<v Speaker 2>but if you're part of these many </v>
<v Speaker 2>military staffs that are absolutely sure</v>

979
00:59:59.761 --> 01:00:04.040
<v Speaker 2>wars coming and you know you can read </v>
<v Speaker 2>accounts from every major military,</v>

980
01:00:04.041 --> 01:00:09.041
<v Speaker 2>the time period we're numbers of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>military planners thought war was </v>

981
01:00:09.041 --> 01:00:09.570
<v Speaker 2>inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

982
01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:14.590
<v Speaker 2>if it's going to be inevitable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it better to fight it now than </v>

983
01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:14.590
<v Speaker 2>lighter?</v>

984
01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:19.640
<v Speaker 2>The Germans were under the impression </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the Russians were on their way to </v>

985
01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.911
<v Speaker 2>superpower status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which if you look at what happened in </v>

986
01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:23.460
<v Speaker 2>the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is exactly how it turned out.</v>

987
01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:29.090
<v Speaker 2>The Germans felt that by 1917,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was going to be a reality that </v>

988
01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:30.540
<v Speaker 2>Russians were completing major military </v>
<v Speaker 2>reforms,</v>

989
01:00:30.541 --> 01:00:35.541
<v Speaker 2>major transportation reforms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were taking advantage of huge </v>

990
01:00:35.541 --> 01:00:38.571
<v Speaker 2>French bank loans to do this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Germans figured if more comes in </v>

991
01:00:38.571 --> 01:00:42.381
<v Speaker 2>three years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be in a much worse </v>

992
01:00:42.381 --> 01:00:42.381
<v Speaker 2>situation than we are now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if it's here,</v>

993
01:00:42.381 --> 01:00:42.600
<v Speaker 2>we might as well do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

994
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:44.550
<v Speaker 2>We have an advantage now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We won't have later.</v>

995
01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:50.580
<v Speaker 2>The French felt similarly about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germans.</v>

996
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:55.630
<v Speaker 2>The Germans felt about the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were looking at the German birth </v>

997
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:55.760
<v Speaker 2>rate and just going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be swamped.</v>

998
01:00:56.850 --> 01:00:58.410
<v Speaker 2>They were looking at the growth in </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>

999
01:00:58.411 --> 01:01:03.411
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Germans were on a tear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if war came in five or six or seven </v>

1000
01:01:04.711 --> 01:01:09.711
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the French are just going to be worse </v>

1001
01:01:09.711 --> 01:01:11.871
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they figured the same thing if was </v>

1002
01:01:11.871 --> 01:01:16.420
<v Speaker 2>going to come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let it come now and amidst these </v>

1003
01:01:18.061 --> 01:01:22.440
<v Speaker 2>interesting conflicts of interest in </v>
<v Speaker 2>worries about timing and all this stuff,</v>

1004
01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:28.170
<v Speaker 2>the world sees where it's heading and </v>
<v Speaker 2>tries to pull back from the brink,</v>

1005
01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.800
<v Speaker 2>but instead of having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1006
01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:34.140
<v Speaker 2>the greatest statesman Europe can </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce during this time period.</v>

1007
01:01:34.141 --> 01:01:39.141
<v Speaker 2>Some of these countries are saddled with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are like millstones around </v>

1008
01:01:39.751 --> 01:01:40.860
<v Speaker 2>the neck of peace.</v>

1009
01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:46.960
<v Speaker 2>People like Kaiser Wilhelm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second the emperor of Germany and </v>

1010
01:01:49.811 --> 01:01:54.811
<v Speaker 2>leadership is such an interesting side </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this conflict because I firmly </v>

1011
01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:59.521
<v Speaker 2>believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had you had a guy of Otto von Bismarck </v>

1012
01:01:59.521 --> 01:02:03.750
<v Speaker 2>caliber in a position of authority in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany when the first world war is on </v>

1013
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:08.431
<v Speaker 2>the verge of happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they could put the pin back in the </v>

1014
01:02:08.431 --> 01:02:08.431
<v Speaker 2>grenade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1015
01:02:08.431 --> 01:02:09.550
<v Speaker 2>the governor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lowe Prinsep,</v>

1016
01:02:09.551 --> 01:02:14.551
<v Speaker 2>metaphorically pulled in Sarajevo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it could have been done and all </v>

1017
01:02:14.551 --> 01:02:18.241
<v Speaker 2>it would have required would have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>some real diplomatic quality.</v>

1018
01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:20.250
<v Speaker 2>Brilliance</v>

1019
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.110
<v Speaker 4>would have been great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't even think you needed that.</v>

1020
01:02:22.111 --> 01:02:27.111
<v Speaker 4>Just some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some high quality workmanship which the </v>

1021
01:02:27.111 --> 01:02:28.950
<v Speaker 4>Germans had produced time and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem was in this time period,</v>

1022
01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:34.230
<v Speaker 4>they are stuck with a ruler who could </v>
<v Speaker 4>not have gotten the job if marriage had </v>

1023
01:02:34.891 --> 01:02:37.080
<v Speaker 4>been one of the requirements,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1024
01:02:37.081 --> 01:02:40.140
<v Speaker 4>of having it handed to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kaiser Wilhelm.</v>

1025
01:02:40.141 --> 01:02:45.030
<v Speaker 4>The second was not a great leader.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He represents the,</v>

1026
01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most wonderful example.</v>

1027
01:02:46.621 --> 01:02:51.621
<v Speaker 4>You can easily think of of what a roll </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the dice hereditary monarchy is and </v>

1028
01:02:53.011 --> 01:02:58.011
<v Speaker 4>how sometimes you get a great role and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you end up with a gifted ruler and then </v>

1029
01:02:58.011 --> 01:03:00.510
<v Speaker 4>it almost seems wonderful that they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>got so much power in their hands,</v>

1030
01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:05.511
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because if someone really knows what to </v>

1031
01:03:05.511 --> 01:03:05.511
<v Speaker 4>do with it and does good things with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you kind of say to yourself,</v>

1032
01:03:05.530 --> 01:03:07.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad they had the power to do those </v>
<v Speaker 4>good things,</v>

1033
01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:09.780
<v Speaker 4>but that's a bit of a roll of the dice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

1034
01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:14.780
<v Speaker 4>As often as you get one of those people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get somebody who's evil or cruel or </v>

1035
01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:18.741
<v Speaker 4>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people throughout history have </v>

1036
01:03:18.741 --> 01:03:20.310
<v Speaker 4>rolled very badly on the dice far too </v>
<v Speaker 4>many times,</v>

1037
01:03:20.311 --> 01:03:22.170
<v Speaker 4>but it creates good hardcore history </v>
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>

1038
01:03:22.171 --> 01:03:22.830
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for us.</v>

1039
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:26.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean the ancient elamites used to roll</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the number is that comes up.</v>

1040
01:03:26.551 --> 01:03:31.551
<v Speaker 4>That means you get yet another insane </v>
<v Speaker 4>ruler in your dynasties made for fun </v>

1041
01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:33.420
<v Speaker 4>reading,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I wouldn't have wanted to live under</v>

1042
01:03:33.421 --> 01:03:36.600
<v Speaker 4>it in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this current leader,</v>

1043
01:03:36.601 --> 01:03:40.200
<v Speaker 4>this current Kaiser Kaiser,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like czar in Russia where they have</v>

1044
01:03:40.201 --> 01:03:44.970
<v Speaker 4>an autocratic king guy to both of those </v>
<v Speaker 4>stem from the word Caesar,</v>

1045
01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:48.240
<v Speaker 4>which right there in the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sounds anachronistic,</v>

1046
01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:53.241
<v Speaker 4>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's part of this old world that </v>

1047
01:03:53.241 --> 01:03:56.091
<v Speaker 4>had existed for forever mean King.</v>
<v Speaker 4>An emperor doesn't sound anachronistic </v>

1048
01:03:56.091 --> 01:03:59.730
<v Speaker 4>at anytime in history before 1914.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Going back to like Mesopotamia does,</v>

1049
01:03:59.731 --> 01:04:01.350
<v Speaker 4>it just sounds weird.</v>

1050
01:04:01.350 --> 01:04:05.100
<v Speaker 4>In the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shows you how old this world is.</v>

1051
01:04:05.101 --> 01:04:10.101
<v Speaker 4>That is marching into the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three of the major powers in this </v>

1052
01:04:10.101 --> 01:04:12.330
<v Speaker 4>conflict are ruled by emperors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kings or czars.</v>

1053
01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:15.650
<v Speaker 4>Now they don't have total power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1054
01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:20.100
<v Speaker 4>the are almost does really a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Kaiser's had his chipped away over a</v>

1055
01:04:20.101 --> 01:04:22.440
<v Speaker 4>couple generations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has to share some power with a German</v>

1056
01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:26.430
<v Speaker 4>legislature which has political parties </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they handle budgets and taxation,</v>

1057
01:04:26.431 --> 01:04:31.431
<v Speaker 4>but the Kaiser's still has a ton of </v>
<v Speaker 4>power over war and foreign policy and </v>

1058
01:04:31.431 --> 01:04:33.900
<v Speaker 4>political appointments and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's just this below average guy.</v>

1059
01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:38.400
<v Speaker 4>The funny part about the Kaiser is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the best thing that ever happened to his</v>

1060
01:04:38.401 --> 01:04:43.401
<v Speaker 4>reputation was out off Hitler because </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you look at the propaganda and you </v>

1061
01:04:43.401 --> 01:04:47.520
<v Speaker 4>read the stuff written about the kaiser </v>
<v Speaker 4>before Hitler comes along and the Kaiser</v>

1062
01:04:47.521 --> 01:04:50.670
<v Speaker 4>is treated as this evil character,</v>
<v Speaker 4>malevolent,</v>

1063
01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:56.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this militaristic want to take over the </v>

1064
01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.810
<v Speaker 4>world blood falling off of the bay and </v>
<v Speaker 4>at uc in the political cartoons.</v>

1065
01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:03.740
<v Speaker 4>And now the attitude that people have </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards him is that he's almost silly or</v>

1066
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:06.410
<v Speaker 4>that he's full of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1067
01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:08.960
<v Speaker 4>he's just wracked with inferiority </v>
<v Speaker 4>complexes.</v>

1068
01:05:08.970 --> 01:05:13.250
<v Speaker 4>He's almost to be pitied.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a little mentally doll but,</v>

1069
01:05:13.251 --> 01:05:15.780
<v Speaker 4>but there isn't that malevolent evil </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of thing.</v>

1070
01:05:15.781 --> 01:05:20.781
<v Speaker 4>And I think part of the reason why is </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have Hitler to compare someone </v>

1071
01:05:20.781 --> 01:05:22.710
<v Speaker 4>to all of a sudden you see that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>kaiser was just sort of a.</v>

1072
01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:25.960
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>marginally bad role on the monarchy,</v>

1073
01:05:25.961 --> 01:05:30.961
<v Speaker 4>dice for what it's worth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was tied into all the other great </v>

1074
01:05:31.181 --> 01:05:33.940
<v Speaker 4>monarchies in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the funny twists in the story,</v>

1075
01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:39.180
<v Speaker 4>and it actually provides something of </v>
<v Speaker 4>importance because at in Europe at this </v>

1076
01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:43.831
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the royal families had relatives of </v>

1077
01:05:43.831 --> 01:05:44.410
<v Speaker 4>other royal families in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in their families,</v>

1078
01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.140
<v Speaker 4>and these families still communicated </v>
<v Speaker 4>with each other,</v>

1079
01:05:47.141 --> 01:05:52.141
<v Speaker 4>which provides like a diplomatic back </v>
<v Speaker 4>channel where these rulers can actually </v>

1080
01:05:52.141 --> 01:05:56.970
<v Speaker 4>sidestep traditional diplomacy and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>write the family member that rules the </v>

1081
01:05:56.970 --> 01:05:57.040
<v Speaker 4>other country.</v>

1082
01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.050
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Queen Victoria,</v>

1083
01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:01.690
<v Speaker 4>who may be the most famous queen in </v>
<v Speaker 4>British history,</v>

1084
01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:06.691
<v Speaker 4>maybe the most important ruled forever </v>
<v Speaker 4>presided over Britain during the height </v>

1085
01:06:06.691 --> 01:06:11.161
<v Speaker 4>of Britain's power when she's </v>
<v Speaker 4>controlling most of the world and the </v>

1086
01:06:11.161 --> 01:06:12.220
<v Speaker 4>Sun proverbially never set on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>British empire.</v>

1087
01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:15.910
<v Speaker 4>Queen Victoria's grandchildren are in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1088
01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:17.560
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kaiser Wilhelm's,</v>

1089
01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:21.610
<v Speaker 4>one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's Queen Victoria's grandchild.</v>

1090
01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:24.310
<v Speaker 4>He's the first cousin of the King of </v>
<v Speaker 4>England.</v>

1091
01:06:24.311 --> 01:06:25.420
<v Speaker 4>King George,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1092
01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:31.200
<v Speaker 4>Not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the czar of Russia is married to </v>

1093
01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:35.410
<v Speaker 4>another Queen Victoria grandchildren.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the czar is her son in law.</v>

1094
01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:40.590
<v Speaker 4>It's also wilhelm's cousin and when he </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets upset or he wants to talk to the </v>

1095
01:06:40.811 --> 01:06:43.130
<v Speaker 4>Russians about something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he will often sit down and pen.</v>

1096
01:06:43.131 --> 01:06:47.530
<v Speaker 4>A quick note to cousin Nikki,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be Tsar Nicholas the second.</v>

1097
01:06:48.970 --> 01:06:53.970
<v Speaker 4>Now the czar in Russia is another </v>
<v Speaker 4>average to low average role on the </v>

1098
01:06:54.311 --> 01:06:58.000
<v Speaker 4>monarchy dice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's perhaps telling and some historians</v>

1099
01:06:58.001 --> 01:07:03.001
<v Speaker 4>have made it out to be that you end up </v>
<v Speaker 4>with such mediocre leadership in such </v>

1100
01:07:03.001 --> 01:07:03.880
<v Speaker 4>powerful countries during this time </v>
<v Speaker 4>period.</v>

1101
01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:09.480
<v Speaker 4>It might account for why you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these international incidents which </v>

1102
01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:13.741
<v Speaker 4>could have led to war previously didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now are because the leadership </v>

1103
01:07:13.741 --> 01:07:15.130
<v Speaker 4>sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean in terms of what you could expect</v>

1104
01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:17.200
<v Speaker 4>that these people were merit based </v>
<v Speaker 4>leaders.</v>

1105
01:07:17.730 --> 01:07:19.570
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can say what you want about a stolen</v>

1106
01:07:19.930 --> 01:07:23.800
<v Speaker 4>or Hitler or even a Mussolini who's been</v>
<v Speaker 4>portrayed again in the west,</v>

1107
01:07:23.801 --> 01:07:28.801
<v Speaker 4>like some sort of clown,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all of those people were formidable </v>

1108
01:07:28.801 --> 01:07:30.880
<v Speaker 4>individuals who rose through the ranks </v>
<v Speaker 4>at some level.</v>

1109
01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:32.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same thing with American politicians.</v>

1110
01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean a guy like Franklin Roosevelt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can say what you want about them,</v>

1111
01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:40.551
<v Speaker 4>but that's a formidable human being with</v>
<v Speaker 4>qualities that allowed them to sort of </v>

1112
01:07:40.551 --> 01:07:42.190
<v Speaker 4>rise to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That requires a merit based,</v>

1113
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:47.400
<v Speaker 4>something being born into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hohenzollern family as the oldest son </v>

1114
01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.660
<v Speaker 4>doesn't require anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the luck of the draw.</v>

1115
01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:53.110
<v Speaker 4>If the job of Kaiser had been merit </v>
<v Speaker 4>based,</v>

1116
01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:55.630
<v Speaker 4>Kaiser Wilhelm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the second wouldn't have gotten anywhere</v>

1117
01:07:55.631 --> 01:08:00.631
<v Speaker 4>near it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And yet he's the guy most responsible </v>

1118
01:08:00.631 --> 01:08:04.350
<v Speaker 4>for putting the pin back in the grenade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If war is going to be avoided here and </v>

1119
01:08:04.350 --> 01:08:04.350
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he famously said,</v>

1120
01:08:04.350 --> 01:08:06.400
<v Speaker 4>after he sacked bismarck and then sacked</v>
<v Speaker 4>another guy,</v>

1121
01:08:06.401 --> 01:08:08.170
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am my own chancellor,</v>

1122
01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.660
<v Speaker 4>meaning I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to run all this myself,</v>

1123
01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:16.290
<v Speaker 4>but what do you do when not only are </v>
<v Speaker 4>they sub par in intelligence and </v>

1124
01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:20.351
<v Speaker 4>brilliance and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but because they're subpar and if they </v>

1125
01:08:20.351 --> 01:08:21.380
<v Speaker 4>can't see that there's sub part and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't even take advice.</v>

1126
01:08:21.381 --> 01:08:22.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1127
01:08:22.191 --> 01:08:27.191
<v Speaker 4>at one point in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Kaiser will ask one of his military </v>

1128
01:08:27.191 --> 01:08:28.250
<v Speaker 4>leaders to do something that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous,</v>

1129
01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:29.960
<v Speaker 4>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lose the war,</v>

1130
01:08:29.961 --> 01:08:34.961
<v Speaker 4>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the military leader will say it </v>

1131
01:08:34.961 --> 01:08:37.271
<v Speaker 4>cannot be done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the Kaiser will embarrass him and </v>

1132
01:08:37.271 --> 01:08:38.400
<v Speaker 4>say something to the effect of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>uncle who was also a field marshal would</v>

1133
01:08:38.401 --> 01:08:39.590
<v Speaker 4>have given me a different answer.</v>

1134
01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:44.770
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would have done what I wanted him to </v>

1135
01:08:44.770 --> 01:08:44.770
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if it was stupid.</v>

1136
01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:46.880
<v Speaker 4>The Kaiser,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to show you how it is too.</v>

1137
01:08:46.881 --> 01:08:49.340
<v Speaker 4>So you understand royalty and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>remember in your head you go,</v>

1138
01:08:49.341 --> 01:08:50.290
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what royalties.</v>

1139
01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.790
<v Speaker 4>Like this same military leader I just </v>
<v Speaker 4>quoted,</v>

1140
01:08:52.791 --> 01:08:57.350
<v Speaker 4>a guy named von Moltke will have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>change the way that the German war games</v>

1141
01:08:57.351 --> 01:09:02.351
<v Speaker 4>system works before the first world war </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he will have to put his foot down </v>

1142
01:09:02.351 --> 01:09:06.580
<v Speaker 4>and take a career risking move and tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>the kaiser that no longer can they keep </v>

1143
01:09:06.801 --> 01:09:11.801
<v Speaker 4>up with the tradition that whatever side</v>
<v Speaker 4>the kaiser is commanding in the German </v>

1144
01:09:11.801 --> 01:09:14.540
<v Speaker 4>national war games has to win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about that for a second.</v>

1145
01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:18.020
<v Speaker 4>Before Field Marshal von Moltke puts his</v>
<v Speaker 4>foot down,</v>

1146
01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.320
<v Speaker 4>whatever side that Kaiser is commanding </v>
<v Speaker 4>in these war games,</v>

1147
01:09:21.321 --> 01:09:24.800
<v Speaker 4>these national maneuvers of national </v>
<v Speaker 4>security importance,</v>

1148
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:28.700
<v Speaker 4>whatever side of the Kaisers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>commanding wins automatically.</v>

1149
01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:34.220
<v Speaker 4>Come on folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's goofy and the Kaiser is a little </v>

1150
01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.901
<v Speaker 4>goofy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got this one arm that was damaged </v>

1151
01:09:37.901 --> 01:09:39.080
<v Speaker 4>during his birth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was withered and had no strength.</v>

1152
01:09:39.081 --> 01:09:40.850
<v Speaker 4>He couldn't cut his own food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1153
01:09:41.090 --> 01:09:44.870
<v Speaker 4>which is so embarrassing to a guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>already got an inferiority complex.</v>

1154
01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:50.140
<v Speaker 4>He goes to England to spend time with </v>
<v Speaker 4>his cousins and they don't really care </v>

1155
01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:53.621
<v Speaker 4>for him too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The British royal family has kind of </v>

1156
01:09:53.621 --> 01:09:54.800
<v Speaker 4>turned off by William and all William </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants is kind of their love and approval</v>

1157
01:09:54.801 --> 01:09:59.801
<v Speaker 4>and to be like them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what's funny is in this sort of </v>

1158
01:09:59.801 --> 01:10:02.711
<v Speaker 4>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm almost like tragic playwright kind </v>

1159
01:10:02.751 --> 01:10:07.751
<v Speaker 4>of way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Kaiser sort of embodies the </v>

1160
01:10:07.751 --> 01:10:08.990
<v Speaker 4>inferiority complex that his country has</v>
<v Speaker 4>at this time too.</v>

1161
01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:14.260
<v Speaker 4>There are new country on the stage and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they think they're being treated like </v>

1162
01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:14.260
<v Speaker 4>trash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're mad,</v>

1163
01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:19.070
<v Speaker 4>they're chauvinistically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how the British and the French </v>

1164
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.070
<v Speaker 4>and those people see them as just these </v>
<v Speaker 4>upstart.</v>

1165
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:20.960
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>push their weight around kind of people,</v>

1166
01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:26.440
<v Speaker 4>but as many historians have pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no nation in the world that </v>

1167
01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:26.600
<v Speaker 4>that's up and coming that doesn't start </v>
<v Speaker 4>to act like it.</v>

1168
01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:31.900
<v Speaker 4>And when they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nations that already have it all </v>

1169
01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:31.900
<v Speaker 4>don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1170
01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:35.591
<v Speaker 4>how do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how does the United States kind of feel </v>

1171
01:10:35.591 --> 01:10:35.591
<v Speaker 4>about China today sort of elbowing its </v>
<v Speaker 4>way into the,</v>

1172
01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:37.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>power structure here.</v>

1173
01:10:37.881 --> 01:10:39.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all understand they deserve it.</v>

1174
01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:42.020
<v Speaker 4>You look at their economics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at all the signs,</v>

1175
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:42.410
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

1176
01:10:42.450 --> 01:10:47.450
<v Speaker 4>they're up and coming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but nobody necessarily feels like that </v>

1177
01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:50.591
<v Speaker 4>person pushing their way in to get their</v>
<v Speaker 4>own space is anything other than a bit </v>

1178
01:10:50.591 --> 01:10:53.150
<v Speaker 4>of an upstart during this time period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The United States plays a similar role.</v>

1179
01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:56.240
<v Speaker 4>This sort of elbowing their way into the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world power,</v>

1180
01:10:56.241 --> 01:10:58.490
<v Speaker 4>whether the people that are already </v>
<v Speaker 4>there like it or not,</v>

1181
01:10:58.491 --> 01:10:59.180
<v Speaker 4>make some room.</v>

1182
01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:01.580
<v Speaker 4>Here we come.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how the German empire was.</v>

1183
01:11:01.730 --> 01:11:06.730
<v Speaker 4>There was a feeling of inferiority and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kaiser Wilhelm held that sort of </v>

1184
01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:10.390
<v Speaker 4>attitude in spades.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you read the stuff at the time </v>

1185
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:14.501
<v Speaker 4>she's portrayed as this militarist and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is the term that is most often for </v>

1186
01:11:14.501 --> 01:11:17.280
<v Speaker 4>this German empire that will be blamed </v>
<v Speaker 4>for everything that's happening here.</v>

1187
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:19.260
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Militarism,</v>

1188
01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:23.490
<v Speaker 4>the entire latter part of the 18 </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundreds.</v>

1189
01:11:23.491 --> 01:11:28.491
<v Speaker 4>People focused on militarism and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>building of these amazingly </v>

1190
01:11:28.491 --> 01:11:29.970
<v Speaker 4>technologically deadly armaments and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>race for power.</v>

1191
01:11:29.971 --> 01:11:32.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just seemed like the world was arming</v>

1192
01:11:32.131 --> 01:11:33.990
<v Speaker 4>itself to the teeth and it was just </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to explode.</v>

1193
01:11:33.991 --> 01:11:38.991
<v Speaker 4>And it was these militarists who were </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsible and people who look at Nazi </v>

1194
01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:40.350
<v Speaker 4>Germany and who are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1195
01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:45.210
<v Speaker 4>I know people who are enthralled by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Wehrmacht and the precision marching and</v>

1196
01:11:45.211 --> 01:11:48.270
<v Speaker 4>the uniforms in this whole sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>militaristic,</v>

1197
01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:50.310
<v Speaker 4>fascist attitude that the Nazis </v>
<v Speaker 4>portrayed.</v>

1198
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:52.980
<v Speaker 4>And I always try to tell them that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Nazis didn't invent this,</v>

1199
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:58.430
<v Speaker 4>that the Nazis were revitalizing regular</v>
<v Speaker 4>German Marshall Attitudes.</v>

1200
01:11:59.491 --> 01:12:00.810
<v Speaker 4>That's the niceties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Militarism.</v>

1201
01:12:00.811 --> 01:12:01.980
<v Speaker 4>If you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Marshall.</v>

1202
01:12:01.981 --> 01:12:06.981
<v Speaker 4>If you do like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what Hitler and his cabal we're </v>

1203
01:12:06.981 --> 01:12:10.461
<v Speaker 4>doing is bringing back traditional </v>
<v Speaker 4>Prussian Marshall Practices that goose </v>

1204
01:12:11.401 --> 01:12:12.750
<v Speaker 4>stepping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>robotic,</v>

1205
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:16.800
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 4>precision drilling and all that.</v>

1206
01:12:16.801 --> 01:12:21.600
<v Speaker 4>Those are qualities that go back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Frederick the great and it freaked out a</v>

1207
01:12:21.601 --> 01:12:26.601
<v Speaker 4>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of the countries in Europe looked </v>

1208
01:12:26.601 --> 01:12:26.601
<v Speaker 4>at this and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look dangerous.</v>

1209
01:12:26.601 --> 01:12:26.730
<v Speaker 4>They look mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They looked chauvinistically.</v>

1210
01:12:26.731 --> 01:12:31.731
<v Speaker 4>They looked like they wanted to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>over your country and then they were </v>

1211
01:12:31.731 --> 01:12:31.731
<v Speaker 4>building this giant navy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now all of a sudden,</v>

1212
01:12:31.731 --> 01:12:36.381
<v Speaker 4>out of nowhere challenging Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the Kaiser had read that same </v>

1213
01:12:36.381 --> 01:12:39.921
<v Speaker 4>book that Theodore Roosevelt read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did anybody do more damage than Alfred?</v>

1214
01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:45.220
<v Speaker 4>They are may hand when he decides to </v>
<v Speaker 4>write a book on naval history because </v>

1215
01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:45.220
<v Speaker 4>the Kaiser,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Roosevelt,</v>

1216
01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:46.230
<v Speaker 4>Reddit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was enthralled with it,</v>

1217
01:12:46.231 --> 01:12:47.250
<v Speaker 4>made all his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1218
01:12:47.251 --> 01:12:48.060
<v Speaker 4>ab rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>read it,</v>

1219
01:12:48.061 --> 01:12:53.061
<v Speaker 4>and then decided he was going to build </v>
<v Speaker 4>this fleet to compete with Britain so </v>

1220
01:12:53.061 --> 01:12:53.061
<v Speaker 4>that they wouldn't take him for granted.</v>

1221
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:59.000
<v Speaker 4>Fascinating character.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A perfect example though of what can </v>

1222
01:12:59.000 --> 01:12:59.760
<v Speaker 4>happen with the role of the monarchy </v>
<v Speaker 4>dice.</v>

1223
01:13:00.930 --> 01:13:01.500
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

1224
01:13:01.501 --> 01:13:06.501
<v Speaker 4>all the governments in Europe that </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter are not all monarchies and </v>

1225
01:13:06.930 --> 01:13:11.930
<v Speaker 4>autocratic governments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are the famous governments of </v>

1226
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:11.930
<v Speaker 4>France and Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1227
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:12.180
<v Speaker 4>Francis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a republic.</v>

1228
01:13:12.181 --> 01:13:17.181
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by this time having tried out royalty </v>

1229
01:13:17.181 --> 01:13:19.540
<v Speaker 4>again after Napoleon decided that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>liked the republic idea better and there</v>

1230
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:23.250
<v Speaker 4>are republic and Britain might as well </v>
<v Speaker 4>be by this time period.</v>

1231
01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:25.650
<v Speaker 4>They still have the king and the royalty</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all that,</v>

1232
01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:29.040
<v Speaker 4>but they don't have any power anymore </v>
<v Speaker 4>than they were during this time period.</v>

1233
01:13:29.041 --> 01:13:34.041
<v Speaker 4>The way the royal family is now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe more gravitas and maybe more able </v>

1234
01:13:34.291 --> 01:13:39.291
<v Speaker 4>to shift public opinion one way or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other than the more cynical generation </v>

1235
01:13:39.291 --> 01:13:43.371
<v Speaker 4>today looks at the current royal family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the time that's about the extent </v>

1236
01:13:43.371 --> 01:13:43.710
<v Speaker 4>of their political authority.</v>

1237
01:13:44.190 --> 01:13:47.010
<v Speaker 4>Parliament,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the legislature of Britain has the power</v>

1238
01:13:47.011 --> 01:13:52.011
<v Speaker 4>then like they have the power now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that creates a dynamic where the </v>

1239
01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:53.220
<v Speaker 4>French and the British have to worry </v>
<v Speaker 4>about things that,</v>

1240
01:13:53.910 --> 01:13:58.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the countries on the other side of the </v>

1241
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.910
<v Speaker 4>ledger or Russia don't have to worry </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

1242
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:59.640
<v Speaker 4>They have to worry about the political </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation.</v>

1243
01:13:59.850 --> 01:14:01.950
<v Speaker 4>They have to worry about their political</v>
<v Speaker 4>opponents.</v>

1244
01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:07.300
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>using the war situation as a political </v>

1245
01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:11.000
<v Speaker 4>issue in Great Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's quite a bit of division over </v>

1246
01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:14.451
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing and during this time </v>
<v Speaker 4>period between when the archduke is </v>

1247
01:14:14.451 --> 01:14:15.910
<v Speaker 4>assassinated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which happens on June 28th,</v>

1248
01:14:15.911 --> 01:14:18.440
<v Speaker 4>1914,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when the Austria,</v>

1249
01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:20.980
<v Speaker 4>Hungarian government issues that famous </v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimatum,</v>

1250
01:14:20.981 --> 01:14:24.040
<v Speaker 4>the list of demands to Serbia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which happens on July 23rd,</v>

1251
01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:25.930
<v Speaker 4>there's a big dead zone in there.</v>

1252
01:14:26.970 --> 01:14:28.170
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not really a dead zone.</v>

1253
01:14:28.171 --> 01:14:30.390
<v Speaker 4>If you were reading the morning papers </v>
<v Speaker 4>every morning in that period,</v>

1254
01:14:30.391 --> 01:14:33.990
<v Speaker 4>there'll be war scares and comments here</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there'd be something new everyday to</v>

1255
01:14:33.991 --> 01:14:37.080
<v Speaker 4>keep you focused on the crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But historically speaking,</v>

1256
01:14:37.081 --> 01:14:39.750
<v Speaker 4>not much happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was going on was behind the scenes,</v>

1257
01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:44.960
<v Speaker 4>a ton of diplomacy and one of the main </v>
<v Speaker 4>avenues of diplomacy or the French </v>

1258
01:14:45.150 --> 01:14:47.160
<v Speaker 4>trying to get the British,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1259
01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:52.200
<v Speaker 4>into some sort of hard agreement for </v>
<v Speaker 4>what they're going to do if this war </v>

1260
01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.761
<v Speaker 4>breaks out in five minutes because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have a hard agreement with the </v>

1261
01:14:55.761 --> 01:14:58.461
<v Speaker 4>British.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They sort of have a soft agreement </v>

1262
01:14:58.461 --> 01:14:59.160
<v Speaker 4>instead of a signed on the dotted line </v>
<v Speaker 4>contract.</v>

1263
01:14:59.310 --> 01:15:04.310
<v Speaker 4>They have a handshake deal and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>starting to get a little bit worried </v>

1264
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:06.981
<v Speaker 4>about the handshake deal and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting worried that even if the </v>

1265
01:15:06.981 --> 01:15:10.410
<v Speaker 4>government in charge in London right now</v>
<v Speaker 4>will come through on the handshake deal,</v>

1266
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:13.410
<v Speaker 4>who's to say they're going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep political power.</v>

1267
01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:15.870
<v Speaker 4>Their opponents could use this war </v>
<v Speaker 4>issue,</v>

1268
01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:17.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to topple the government,</v>

1269
01:15:17.251 --> 01:15:19.010
<v Speaker 4>take control of the government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then say to France,</v>

1270
01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:20.670
<v Speaker 4>we only have a handshake deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

1271
01:15:20.671 --> 01:15:24.060
<v Speaker 4>the new government will not comply with </v>
<v Speaker 4>a handshake deal.</v>

1272
01:15:24.061 --> 01:15:25.650
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not getting involved in this war.</v>

1273
01:15:25.651 --> 01:15:30.651
<v Speaker 4>We're neutral.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have this splendid isolation and the </v>

1274
01:15:30.651 --> 01:15:30.651
<v Speaker 4>navy will protect us because remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>folks,</v>

1275
01:15:30.651 --> 01:15:35.121
<v Speaker 4>look at a map of Great Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a giant moat around their </v>

1276
01:15:35.121 --> 01:15:36.270
<v Speaker 4>country and the greatest navy in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world to protect it.</v>

1277
01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:38.970
<v Speaker 4>They have the option of staying out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this thing if they want to.</v>

1278
01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:44.660
<v Speaker 4>The French don't have that luxury.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They run the invasion list there on the </v>

1279
01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:48.441
<v Speaker 4>dinner menu for imperial Germany and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're looking for people to provide </v>

1280
01:15:48.441 --> 01:15:49.920
<v Speaker 4>some help.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've got the Russians,</v>

1281
01:15:49.921 --> 01:15:54.921
<v Speaker 4>but the Russians are a long way away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not being on the dinner menu for the</v>

1282
01:15:56.551 --> 01:16:01.551
<v Speaker 4>imperial German military meant that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>British situation was fundamentally </v>

1283
01:16:01.551 --> 01:16:01.890
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>

1284
01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:08.710
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't see a real positive </v>
<v Speaker 4>outcome for them if they get involved in</v>

1285
01:16:08.711 --> 01:16:13.711
<v Speaker 4>this whole affair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there are things the French can </v>

1286
01:16:13.711 --> 01:16:13.711
<v Speaker 4>gain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've got a couple of last territories</v>

1287
01:16:13.711 --> 01:16:15.880
<v Speaker 4>they lost to Germany and the war of 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>78 and 71.</v>

1288
01:16:16.090 --> 01:16:19.210
<v Speaker 4>They'd like to get those back in a best </v>
<v Speaker 4>case scenario,</v>

1289
01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if this conflict breaks out,</v>

1290
01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:25.890
<v Speaker 4>they will get them back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The British don't have anything that </v>

1291
01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:25.990
<v Speaker 4>wonderfully positive to look forward to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1292
01:16:25.991 --> 01:16:28.360
<v Speaker 4>they might alleviate the threat of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>German fleet,</v>

1293
01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:33.780
<v Speaker 4>but by 1912 it was already felt that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>British had proven that the Germans </v>

1294
01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:36.190
<v Speaker 4>could not compete with them in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>building of ships,</v>

1295
01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:39.460
<v Speaker 4>not if they wanted to have a great land </v>
<v Speaker 4>army at the same time.</v>

1296
01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:42.430
<v Speaker 4>And so that's kind of out of the way by </v>
<v Speaker 4>this point.</v>

1297
01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:47.820
<v Speaker 4>So no big gain there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And maybe you protect France from </v>

1298
01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:51.721
<v Speaker 4>falling because if France falls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get the situation you had in the </v>

1299
01:16:51.721 --> 01:16:54.481
<v Speaker 4>Second World War in 1940,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're all of a sudden you have the </v>

1300
01:16:54.481 --> 01:16:57.721
<v Speaker 4>German staring across the English </v>
<v Speaker 4>Channel from you and then all of a </v>

1301
01:16:57.721 --> 01:16:58.600
<v Speaker 4>sudden that moat doesn't look that wide </v>
<v Speaker 4>does it,</v>

1302
01:16:59.470 --> 01:17:04.470
<v Speaker 4>but that's not a lot of positive stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>to go into the first global conflict in </v>

1303
01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:06.130
<v Speaker 4>100 years for to the British.</v>

1304
01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:11.130
<v Speaker 4>This looks like a massive disruption of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their extremely profitable business </v>

1305
01:17:11.130 --> 01:17:15.581
<v Speaker 4>ventures.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've been snapping up books like the </v>

1306
01:17:15.581 --> 01:17:19.451
<v Speaker 4>great illusion written by Norman Angle </v>
<v Speaker 4>where every historian points out how </v>

1307
01:17:19.451 --> 01:17:23.141
<v Speaker 4>influential this book was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where angle is trying to explain to the </v>

1308
01:17:23.141 --> 01:17:26.210
<v Speaker 4>people in that time period that this war</v>
<v Speaker 4>that continually gets threatened,</v>

1309
01:17:26.211 --> 01:17:30.350
<v Speaker 4>like the Russian roulette trigger being </v>
<v Speaker 4>pulled is never going to happen.</v>

1310
01:17:30.351 --> 01:17:35.351
<v Speaker 4>It can't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The world has become to interdependent </v>

1311
01:17:35.351 --> 01:17:36.530
<v Speaker 4>in that time period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's too much globalization.</v>

1312
01:17:36.531 --> 01:17:39.860
<v Speaker 4>This is the early period where all that </v>
<v Speaker 4>starts where you have the telegraph,</v>

1313
01:17:39.861 --> 01:17:44.861
<v Speaker 4>providing instant communication and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>railroads on the shipping lines and </v>

1314
01:17:44.861 --> 01:17:47.060
<v Speaker 4>trade had never been higher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wealth had never been grander and Europe</v>

1315
01:17:47.061 --> 01:17:52.061
<v Speaker 4>was at the height of its financial power</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Britain was at the height of </v>

1316
01:17:52.061 --> 01:17:55.811
<v Speaker 4>everybody's financial power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would you mess with that economic </v>

1317
01:17:55.811 --> 01:17:55.940
<v Speaker 4>situation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guys like angle?</v>

1318
01:17:55.941 --> 01:18:00.941
<v Speaker 4>We're saying that what had happened is </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was so profitable to simply do </v>

1319
01:18:00.941 --> 01:18:04.190
<v Speaker 4>business as usual that there was nothing</v>
<v Speaker 4>worth going to war over.</v>

1320
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:10.270
<v Speaker 4>What angle was saying is that anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>you would gain by launching a war would </v>

1321
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:14.411
<v Speaker 4>be dwarfed by what you would lose by </v>
<v Speaker 4>destroying the system that was allowing </v>

1322
01:18:14.411 --> 01:18:15.560
<v Speaker 4>everyone to make so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's an old line,</v>

1323
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:19.250
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that when goods don't cross borders,</v>

1324
01:18:19.730 --> 01:18:21.440
<v Speaker 4>armies will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1325
01:18:21.441 --> 01:18:26.441
<v Speaker 4>this is the opposite situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their goods are crossing borders like </v>

1326
01:18:26.441 --> 01:18:26.810
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So guys like angle tell you that,</v>

1327
01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:28.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of that formula and they believe</v>

1328
01:18:28.611 --> 01:18:33.611
<v Speaker 4>in that formula.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't have a war with the British </v>

1329
01:18:33.611 --> 01:18:34.040
<v Speaker 4>are starting to find out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1330
01:18:34.041 --> 01:18:36.690
<v Speaker 4>as this dead zone period from the end of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the arch,</v>

1331
01:18:36.691 --> 01:18:38.780
<v Speaker 4>Duke's assassination to the ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 4>unbiased Serbia.</v>

1332
01:18:38.781 --> 01:18:43.781
<v Speaker 4>What the British are starting to find </v>
<v Speaker 4>out is that angle is at least partially </v>

1333
01:18:43.781 --> 01:18:44.690
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He may be right.</v>

1334
01:18:44.691 --> 01:18:47.600
<v Speaker 4>That you will destroy a whole system </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's making everybody rich.</v>

1335
01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:53.020
<v Speaker 4>He seems to be wrong in thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the powers that be will avoid a war </v>

1336
01:18:53.751 --> 01:18:58.751
<v Speaker 4>because of that and the British </v>
<v Speaker 4>government is having a hard time selling</v>

1337
01:19:00.681 --> 01:19:03.020
<v Speaker 4>their people on the idea that this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>good for Britain.</v>

1338
01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:11.460
<v Speaker 4>On July 23rd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>finally the long awaited response from </v>

1339
01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:14.260
<v Speaker 4>the Austro-hungarian government to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>killing of their heir to the throne.</v>

1340
01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:19.860
<v Speaker 4>They send an ultimatum that to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>government of Serbia and the ultimatum </v>

1341
01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:23.941
<v Speaker 4>is one of those documents you can look </v>
<v Speaker 4>at throughout history that is obviously </v>

1342
01:19:23.941 --> 01:19:27.331
<v Speaker 4>designed to be rejected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The demands would eviscerate Serbian </v>

1343
01:19:27.371 --> 01:19:29.950
<v Speaker 4>sovereignty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no sovereign state could agree to this,</v>

1344
01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:33.760
<v Speaker 4>and they're only given 48 hours to </v>
<v Speaker 4>respond to all these different points.</v>

1345
01:19:33.761 --> 01:19:36.070
<v Speaker 4>The rejection of any one of which means </v>
<v Speaker 4>war.</v>

1346
01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:39.400
<v Speaker 4>But the day before the 48 hour deadline </v>
<v Speaker 4>runs out,</v>

1347
01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:43.840
<v Speaker 4>the Serb government sends a message to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the czar of Russia asking for help,</v>

1348
01:19:44.610 --> 01:19:45.520
<v Speaker 4>and they wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

1349
01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:48.940
<v Speaker 4>we cannot defend ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Therefore we pray.</v>

1350
01:19:48.941 --> 01:19:51.280
<v Speaker 4>Your Majesty descend help as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

1351
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:54.340
<v Speaker 4>Your Majesty has given many proofs of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your previous goodwill,</v>

1352
01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.620
<v Speaker 4>and we confidently hope that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>appeal,</v>

1353
01:19:56.621 --> 01:19:58.510
<v Speaker 4>we'll find an echo when you're generous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Slav,</v>

1354
01:19:58.511 --> 01:20:03.511
<v Speaker 4>heart and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Serbs send a response back to the </v>

1355
01:20:04.930 --> 01:20:06.160
<v Speaker 4>Austra Hungarians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not good enough.</v>

1356
01:20:06.610 --> 01:20:09.600
<v Speaker 4>The declare a war on July,</v>
<v Speaker 4>28th,</v>

1357
01:20:09.601 --> 01:20:14.601
<v Speaker 4>exactly one month after the </v>
<v Speaker 4>assassination and they're shelling </v>

1358
01:20:14.601 --> 01:20:17.961
<v Speaker 4>Belgrade in like five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Russians declare mobilization in </v>

1359
01:20:19.541 --> 01:20:24.541
<v Speaker 4>response to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the moment when the first </v>

1360
01:20:24.541 --> 01:20:29.240
<v Speaker 4>outside power turns on their doomsday </v>
<v Speaker 4>device is when the Austra Hungarians and</v>

1361
01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:32.600
<v Speaker 4>the Serbians mobilize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't freak anyone else out because</v>

1362
01:20:32.601 --> 01:20:37.601
<v Speaker 4>they're going to fight a little war </v>
<v Speaker 4>against each other and they have to </v>

1363
01:20:37.601 --> 01:20:39.941
<v Speaker 4>mobilize to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's when the first outside power tied </v>

1364
01:20:39.941 --> 01:20:43.841
<v Speaker 4>to these alliance systems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>flicks on their doomsday device that </v>

1365
01:20:43.841 --> 01:20:45.230
<v Speaker 4>everyone else is going to feel the </v>
<v Speaker 4>pressure to do the same thing.</v>

1366
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:52.030
<v Speaker 4>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most pressure because they're the </v>

1367
01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:53.150
<v Speaker 4>ones with the very short window of </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity.</v>

1368
01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:57.170
<v Speaker 4>I think the designer of the military </v>
<v Speaker 4>plans count.</v>

1369
01:20:57.171 --> 01:20:59.540
<v Speaker 4>Schlieffen had figured out it was about </v>
<v Speaker 4>900,</v>

1370
01:20:59.541 --> 01:21:04.541
<v Speaker 4>950 hours that they had to smash the </v>
<v Speaker 4>potential of France.</v>

1371
01:21:05.151 --> 01:21:10.151
<v Speaker 4>She didn't have to be mopped up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she had to be smashed within 950 or </v>

1372
01:21:10.151 --> 01:21:13.841
<v Speaker 4>so hours before the Russians would start</v>
<v Speaker 4>to come in from the east with their </v>

1373
01:21:13.841 --> 01:21:15.980
<v Speaker 4>armies now mobilize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you screwed that up,</v>

1374
01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:21.010
<v Speaker 4>they could be in Berlin and having </v>
<v Speaker 4>coffee and cigarettes and poking the </v>

1375
01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:22.400
<v Speaker 4>Kaiser with a stick in a cage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the time you know,</v>

1376
01:21:22.401 --> 01:21:24.110
<v Speaker 4>the Germans figured out what was going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

1377
01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:29.440
<v Speaker 4>so the minute the Russians mobilize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have this crisis because the </v>

1378
01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:33.491
<v Speaker 4>Russians have the flexibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they want to have just sending those </v>

1379
01:21:33.491 --> 01:21:35.090
<v Speaker 4>people home in a month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mobilization doesn't mean more to them,</v>

1380
01:21:35.810 --> 01:21:40.810
<v Speaker 4>but it does to the Germans because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've got to start their plans and </v>

1381
01:21:41.121 --> 01:21:43.640
<v Speaker 4>every day they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That 950 or so,</v>

1382
01:21:43.641 --> 01:21:44.870
<v Speaker 4>our window is shrinking.</v>

1383
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:51.830
<v Speaker 4>This is the point in the story where the</v>
<v Speaker 4>military plans begin to take over the </v>

1384
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:56.751
<v Speaker 4>political process in a way that makes it</v>
<v Speaker 4>impossible for the politicians and the </v>

1385
01:21:56.751 --> 01:21:59.490
<v Speaker 4>diplomat to do what they need to do to </v>
<v Speaker 4>potentially stop this conflict.</v>

1386
01:21:59.491 --> 01:22:02.070
<v Speaker 4>They need time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They need time.</v>

1387
01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:07.340
<v Speaker 4>On the 26th of July,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the government of Britain calls a peace </v>

1388
01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:07.910
<v Speaker 4>conferences for the major powers that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they could hash this out,</v>

1389
01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:09.900
<v Speaker 4>talk it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's got the time.</v>

1390
01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.630
<v Speaker 4>Once the Russians hit the mobilization </v>
<v Speaker 4>switch,</v>

1391
01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:17.280
<v Speaker 4>the Germans are under pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tell the Russians to stop.</v>

1392
01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:20.690
<v Speaker 4>The Russians say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're only doing this against Austria,</v>

1393
01:22:20.691 --> 01:22:21.630
<v Speaker 4>Hungary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This isn't meant.</v>

1394
01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:22.800
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>against you.</v>

1395
01:22:22.990 --> 01:22:25.440
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Germans have a problem now,</v>

1396
01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:27.210
<v Speaker 4>and they begin going to everyone else </v>
<v Speaker 4>and saying,</v>

1397
01:22:27.211 --> 01:22:28.040
<v Speaker 4>are you in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you in?</v>

1398
01:22:28.041 --> 01:22:30.300
<v Speaker 4>They go to the French.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me say to the French,</v>

1399
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:35.990
<v Speaker 4>are you in this conflict that's about to</v>
<v Speaker 4>come out because we're going to go to </v>

1400
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:35.990
<v Speaker 4>war with the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they don't demobilize,</v>

1401
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.720
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to do?</v>

1402
01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:42.720
<v Speaker 4>The French,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to act in accordance with </v>

1403
01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:42.720
<v Speaker 4>our interest from the German said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1404
01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:43.210
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to stay out of this war,</v>

1405
01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:48.360
<v Speaker 4>all you have to do is hand us the keys </v>
<v Speaker 4>to all your faults on are fortified </v>

1406
01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:50.380
<v Speaker 4>border until the war in the east is </v>
<v Speaker 4>over.</v>

1407
01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:54.220
<v Speaker 4>That says a pledge of your good behavior</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we'll consider you out of this war.</v>

1408
01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:59.520
<v Speaker 4>That is impossible for the French </v>
<v Speaker 4>government to do as the demands on </v>

1409
01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.810
<v Speaker 4>Serbia war for the Serbians to do fringe</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't do that.</v>

1410
01:23:01.811 --> 01:23:04.570
<v Speaker 4>That's an handover.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your national security keys to your most</v>

1411
01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:07.720
<v Speaker 4>antagonistic historic enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so,</v>

1412
01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:13.050
<v Speaker 4>and the Germans must have known that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they knew they couldn't keep France out </v>

1413
01:23:13.050 --> 01:23:16.381
<v Speaker 4>of this conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is why they had these fantastic </v>

1414
01:23:16.381 --> 01:23:19.561
<v Speaker 4>military plans to defeat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to powers the country they were really </v>

1415
01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:22.780
<v Speaker 4>hoping to keep out of the conflict was </v>
<v Speaker 4>Great Britain when they kept negotiating</v>

1416
01:23:22.781 --> 01:23:24.160
<v Speaker 4>with Britain saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1417
01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:26.380
<v Speaker 4>you don't have any deal here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're cousins.</v>

1418
01:23:26.381 --> 01:23:28.360
<v Speaker 4>We're both Anglo saxons were the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>race.</v>

1419
01:23:28.361 --> 01:23:29.920
<v Speaker 4>You know the French are your historic </v>
<v Speaker 4>enemies.</v>

1420
01:23:29.921 --> 01:23:34.860
<v Speaker 4>Are you really going to work with them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>On the 30th of July,</v>

1421
01:23:34.861 --> 01:23:37.710
<v Speaker 4>the British prime minister wrote in his </v>
<v Speaker 4>diary,</v>

1422
01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:43.820
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the European situation is at least one </v>

1423
01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:47.061
<v Speaker 4>degree worse than it was yesterday and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it has not been improved by a rather </v>

1424
01:23:47.061 --> 01:23:50.841
<v Speaker 4>shameless attempt on the part of Germany</v>
<v Speaker 4>to buy our neutrality during the war by </v>

1425
01:23:50.841 --> 01:23:55.521
<v Speaker 4>promises that she will not annex French </v>
<v Speaker 4>territory except colonies or Holland or </v>

1426
01:23:55.741 --> 01:24:00.741
<v Speaker 4>Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is something very crude he writes </v>

1427
01:24:00.741 --> 01:24:01.530
<v Speaker 4>and childlike about German diplomacy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>

1428
01:24:01.531 --> 01:24:05.100
<v Speaker 4>the French are beginning to press in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>opposite sense as the Russians have been</v>

1429
01:24:05.101 --> 01:24:08.190
<v Speaker 4>doing for some time the city he means </v>
<v Speaker 4>London,</v>

1430
01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:11.790
<v Speaker 4>which is in a terrible state of </v>
<v Speaker 4>depression and paralysis is for the time</v>

1431
01:24:11.791 --> 01:24:16.791
<v Speaker 4>being all against English intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the prospect very black today </v>

1432
01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:22.250
<v Speaker 4>and to quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but something will happen that will </v>

1433
01:24:22.250 --> 01:24:26.311
<v Speaker 4>change the mood in Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something that will help to create a </v>

1434
01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:29.140
<v Speaker 4>good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad guy narrative in this war.</v>

1435
01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:30.490
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I told you earlier,</v>

1436
01:24:30.491 --> 01:24:35.491
<v Speaker 4>one of the key issues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because this war is so important to the </v>

1437
01:24:35.491 --> 01:24:38.191
<v Speaker 4>rest of the 20th century in 21st century</v>
<v Speaker 4>history is whose fault at all is and the</v>

1438
01:24:38.321 --> 01:24:41.650
<v Speaker 4>British are very concerned during this </v>
<v Speaker 4>time period that they be.</v>

1439
01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:44.740
<v Speaker 4>If they intervene,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intervening on the right side,</v>

1440
01:24:45.190 --> 01:24:47.890
<v Speaker 4>who's the bad guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to depend on what happens.</v>

1441
01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:53.960
<v Speaker 4>That's again where the German war plans </v>
<v Speaker 4>put them in a situation where for the </v>

1442
01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:58.281
<v Speaker 4>war plan to succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to create strategic problems </v>

1443
01:24:58.281 --> 01:24:59.700
<v Speaker 4>that are going to cost you the war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The biggest thing the Germans need to do</v>

1444
01:24:59.701 --> 01:25:01.500
<v Speaker 4>here is keep the British out of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>war,</v>

1445
01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:06.770
<v Speaker 4>but the war plans involve a requirement </v>
<v Speaker 4>that will bring the British into the </v>

1446
01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:11.091
<v Speaker 4>war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Germans can't attack the French </v>

1447
01:25:11.091 --> 01:25:12.080
<v Speaker 4>along their mutual border.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That border is full of forts.</v>

1448
01:25:12.630 --> 01:25:17.630
<v Speaker 4>It's the most one of the most fortified </v>
<v Speaker 4>borders throughout world history ever </v>

1449
01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:17.970
<v Speaker 4>since Roman times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same area,</v>

1450
01:25:17.971 --> 01:25:22.971
<v Speaker 4>but 120 mile front that will become the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Maginot line after this war and before </v>

1451
01:25:22.981 --> 01:25:25.470
<v Speaker 4>the Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 4>During this time period,</v>

1452
01:25:25.471 --> 01:25:30.471
<v Speaker 4>there are fantastically technologically </v>
<v Speaker 4>sophisticated forts all through this 120</v>

1453
01:25:30.721 --> 01:25:35.721
<v Speaker 4>mile border between Germany and France </v>
<v Speaker 4>with interlocking fields of fire and </v>

1454
01:25:35.821 --> 01:25:40.821
<v Speaker 4>large garrison's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that the Germans can't defeat </v>

1455
01:25:40.821 --> 01:25:40.821
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did in 18,</v>

1456
01:25:40.821 --> 01:25:41.730
<v Speaker 4>70 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>71.</v>

1457
01:25:41.731 --> 01:25:46.731
<v Speaker 4>That was the root of invasion back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is the Germans can't defeat </v>

1458
01:25:46.731 --> 01:25:50.280
<v Speaker 4>them within that 950 or so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our window,</v>

1459
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:53.760
<v Speaker 4>by the time the German smashed their way</v>
<v Speaker 4>through those forts,</v>

1460
01:25:54.030 --> 01:25:57.660
<v Speaker 4>the Russians are in Berlin and Silesia </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everywhere else.</v>

1461
01:25:57.661 --> 01:26:02.661
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's only one thing the Germans </v>

1462
01:26:02.661 --> 01:26:05.511
<v Speaker 4>can see their way to doing as part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>this plan to win the two front and </v>

1463
01:26:05.511 --> 01:26:05.511
<v Speaker 4>that's</v>

1464
01:26:05.511 --> 01:26:07.010
<v Speaker 2>just smashed into France and the part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>France that's undefended,</v>

1465
01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:12.280
<v Speaker 2>but the reason the part of France that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>undefended or less defended than this </v>

1466
01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:16.200
<v Speaker 2>fortified border is less defendant is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it isn't on the border with </v>

1467
01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.420
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so on the border with a bunch of neutral</v>

1468
01:26:17.421 --> 01:26:22.421
<v Speaker 2>states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are going to have to be the </v>

1469
01:26:22.421 --> 01:26:24.740
<v Speaker 2>highways the German army uses to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Germany to France.</v>

1470
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:28.550
<v Speaker 2>The only problem is is that those </v>
<v Speaker 2>highways neutrality is guaranteed by the</v>

1471
01:26:28.551 --> 01:26:32.240
<v Speaker 2>British government and has been for 75 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1472
01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:38.940
<v Speaker 2>What is about to happen as a result of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stipulations of those German war </v>

1473
01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:42.571
<v Speaker 2>plans is potentially the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>mistake ever made.</v>

1474
01:26:43.450 --> 01:26:45.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd put it on my top 10 list somewhere.</v>

1475
01:26:45.671 --> 01:26:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Greatest mistakes ever made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're a German,</v>

1476
01:26:47.951 --> 01:26:52.951
<v Speaker 2>I have to believe that I have a hard </v>
<v Speaker 2>time figuring out what is a greater </v>

1477
01:26:52.951 --> 01:26:57.691
<v Speaker 2>mistake for the entire history of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>nation as a unified country since 18,</v>

1478
01:26:57.731 --> 01:27:00.200
<v Speaker 2>71.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a hard time finding something you</v>

1479
01:27:00.201 --> 01:27:05.201
<v Speaker 2>could label as a greater mistake than </v>
<v Speaker 2>this one because so many of the other </v>

1480
01:27:05.201 --> 01:27:08.881
<v Speaker 2>candidates you might put as your </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest mistake only happened because </v>

1481
01:27:08.881 --> 01:27:12.841
<v Speaker 2>of this mistake before it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The invasion of Belgium is a disaster </v>

1482
01:27:12.841 --> 01:27:15.100
<v Speaker 2>for Germany on so many fronts and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're talking about here.</v>

1483
01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Originally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way back in like the late 18 hundreds,</v>

1484
01:27:18.641 --> 01:27:23.641
<v Speaker 2>early 19 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holland had also been on the list of </v>

1485
01:27:23.641 --> 01:27:23.800
<v Speaker 2>countries to be used as a highway for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the German army.</v>

1486
01:27:23.801 --> 01:27:26.890
<v Speaker 2>But since that time and as the war plans</v>
<v Speaker 2>were refined,</v>

1487
01:27:26.891 --> 01:27:31.891
<v Speaker 2>it was just narrowed down to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>Belgium and the Germans were sort of </v>

1488
01:27:31.891 --> 01:27:33.460
<v Speaker 2>naively hoping that the Belgians would </v>
<v Speaker 2>just step aside,</v>

1489
01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:38.900
<v Speaker 2>like line their army up on both sides of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the street and watched the Germans </v>

1490
01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:38.900
<v Speaker 2>marched through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1491
01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.390
<v Speaker 2>the British and the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1492
01:27:41.410 --> 01:27:46.410
<v Speaker 2>who are sort of the forefathers of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germans were two of the signatories to </v>

1493
01:27:46.410 --> 01:27:50.131
<v Speaker 2>something called the Treaty of London in</v>
<v Speaker 2>1839 that pledged to defend Belgium's </v>

1494
01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:50.830
<v Speaker 2>neutrality</v>

1495
01:27:51.650 --> 01:27:55.940
<v Speaker 2>in a wonderfully tragic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ironic sort of connection to,</v>

1496
01:27:55.941 --> 01:28:00.941
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the role Belgium is going to play </v>

1497
01:28:00.941 --> 01:28:03.881
<v Speaker 2>leading to the first world war is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar to the role Poland played </v>

1498
01:28:03.881 --> 01:28:07.010
<v Speaker 2>leading up to the second in both cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those countries where the reason Britain</v>

1499
01:28:07.011 --> 01:28:10.040
<v Speaker 2>got dragged into the conflict before the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second World War,</v>

1500
01:28:10.041 --> 01:28:15.041
<v Speaker 2>Britain had tried to stop Hitler's </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemingly endless ambition by putting a </v>

1501
01:28:16.101 --> 01:28:18.820
<v Speaker 2>roadblock in his way in guaranteeing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>independence of Poland.</v>

1502
01:28:19.250 --> 01:28:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Hitler ignored that guarantee went into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Poland and Britain's and the war in the </v>

1503
01:28:24.250 --> 01:28:28.061
<v Speaker 2>first world war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same thing is happening with </v>

1504
01:28:28.061 --> 01:28:29.891
<v Speaker 2>Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The German planners can see no way to </v>

1505
01:28:29.891 --> 01:28:29.891
<v Speaker 2>win this war without violating Belgium's</v>
<v Speaker 2>neutrality.</v>

1506
01:28:29.891 --> 01:28:34.861
<v Speaker 2>As we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what makes it the greatest </v>

1507
01:28:34.861 --> 01:28:37.211
<v Speaker 2>mistake though potentially in all German</v>
<v Speaker 2>history because violating Belgium ends </v>

1508
01:28:37.211 --> 01:28:40.931
<v Speaker 2>up taking a Britain that one historian </v>
<v Speaker 2>says as recently as two days before they</v>

1509
01:28:41.361 --> 01:28:45.230
<v Speaker 2>declare war on Germany is leaning toward</v>
<v Speaker 2>neutrality.</v>

1510
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:48.230
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing to think about two days </v>
<v Speaker 2>before they enter the war,</v>

1511
01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:50.450
<v Speaker 2>the government is leaning toward </v>
<v Speaker 2>neutrality.</v>

1512
01:28:50.451 --> 01:28:52.760
<v Speaker 2>What changed that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The invasion of Belgium,</v>

1513
01:28:54.890 --> 01:28:57.980
<v Speaker 2>the invasion of Belgium does to terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1514
01:28:57.981 --> 01:28:59.930
<v Speaker 2>If you're looking at this from Germany's</v>
<v Speaker 2>point of view,</v>

1515
01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:01.830
<v Speaker 2>the first thing is changes.</v>

1516
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.410
<v Speaker 4>British,</v>
<v Speaker 4>political and public opinion,</v>

1517
01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.330
<v Speaker 4>almost overnight on a dime</v>

1518
01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:10.690
<v Speaker 4>as the British prime minister,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Herbert Asquith put it.</v>

1519
01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:15.720
<v Speaker 4>He of course wants to get more involved </v>
<v Speaker 4>in this looming war because of the </v>

1520
01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:17.620
<v Speaker 4>handshake deal with France.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said that the ultimatum,</v>

1521
01:29:17.621 --> 01:29:20.530
<v Speaker 4>the Germans give to the Belgians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>simplify matters.</v>

1522
01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:25.800
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to convince the rest of Britain </v>

1523
01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:28.741
<v Speaker 4>that they have a dog in this continental</v>
<v Speaker 4>war looming up have some real </v>

1524
01:29:28.741 --> 01:29:32.701
<v Speaker 4>ammunition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first thing is a signed treaty with </v>

1525
01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:35.641
<v Speaker 4>the Belgians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a handshake deal that's in </v>

1526
01:29:35.641 --> 01:29:38.820
<v Speaker 4>inc and its long standing as is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>national security concern that Britain </v>

1527
01:29:38.831 --> 01:29:43.831
<v Speaker 4>has had for a very long time of keeping </v>
<v Speaker 4>the channel ports in Belgium out of the </v>

1528
01:29:43.831 --> 01:29:47.971
<v Speaker 4>hands of some dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hostile power throughout most of </v>

1529
01:29:47.971 --> 01:29:48.790
<v Speaker 4>Britain's history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That dangerous hostile power was France,</v>

1530
01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:51.370
<v Speaker 4>but they're calling the kaiser,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the new Napoleon,</v>

1531
01:29:51.670 --> 01:29:55.000
<v Speaker 4>and if he goes into Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to have those channel ports.</v>

1532
01:29:56.350 --> 01:29:59.520
<v Speaker 4>So what had been a more sort of high </v>
<v Speaker 4>brow,</v>

1533
01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:04.450
<v Speaker 4>a argument that didn't really appeal to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the gut is changing because of Belgium.</v>

1534
01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:09.900
<v Speaker 4>The most important appeal to the gut </v>
<v Speaker 4>though that Belgium has is the </v>

1535
01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:12.010
<v Speaker 4>propaganda slash pr side of this whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1536
01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:18.060
<v Speaker 4>Belgium is what destroys Germany's </v>
<v Speaker 4>reputation in terms of global public </v>

1537
01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:22.741
<v Speaker 4>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there'd always been people who </v>

1538
01:30:22.741 --> 01:30:22.741
<v Speaker 4>called Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this evil malevolent,</v>

1539
01:30:22.741 --> 01:30:26.970
<v Speaker 4>militaristic country and what have you </v>
<v Speaker 4>been on the world stage as soon as the </v>

1540
01:30:26.970 --> 01:30:30.841
<v Speaker 4>Germans invaded Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they participate in the most aggressive </v>

1541
01:30:30.841 --> 01:30:33.070
<v Speaker 4>act so far by any of the major powers in</v>
<v Speaker 4>this conflict.</v>

1542
01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:38.280
<v Speaker 4>Austro-Hungarian assault against Serbia </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe before this was the most </v>

1543
01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:40.540
<v Speaker 4>egregious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that was seen as having some sort of</v>

1544
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:46.350
<v Speaker 4>connection to events.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the Serbian government had maybe </v>

1545
01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:49.501
<v Speaker 4>been involved in this assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was something to do with one </v>

1546
01:30:49.501 --> 01:30:49.501
<v Speaker 4>another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Belgium was an innocent bystander,</v>

1547
01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:54.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a shooting war breaks out </v>

1548
01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:56.851
<v Speaker 4>between a couple of of gangsters on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>street and the first thing one of the </v>

1549
01:30:56.851 --> 01:31:00.361
<v Speaker 4>gangsters does is turn to the side and </v>
<v Speaker 4>kills an innocent bystander because </v>

1550
01:31:00.361 --> 01:31:03.721
<v Speaker 4>they're standing in their way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a little like what this is </v>

1551
01:31:03.721 --> 01:31:03.721
<v Speaker 4>portrayed as by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1552
01:31:03.721 --> 01:31:08.161
<v Speaker 4>the allied propaganda services which </v>
<v Speaker 4>make the most use of this Belgium thing </v>

1553
01:31:08.161 --> 01:31:10.120
<v Speaker 4>you can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So much so that it incense,</v>

1554
01:31:10.210 --> 01:31:15.210
<v Speaker 4>people like off Hitler who will write </v>
<v Speaker 4>later in mind comp that nowhere else </v>

1555
01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:17.470
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Germans,</v>

1556
01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:22.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fall so far behind the British and the </v>

1557
01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:22.800
<v Speaker 4>French later the Americans than they did</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the.</v>

1558
01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:23.980
<v Speaker 4>In the realm of propaganda.</v>

1559
01:31:25.490 --> 01:31:27.890
<v Speaker 4>Hitler says the huge mistake of Germany </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Austria,</v>

1560
01:31:27.891 --> 01:31:31.730
<v Speaker 4>Hungary is propaganda was to portray the</v>
<v Speaker 4>enemy as comical.</v>

1561
01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:34.580
<v Speaker 4>And he said that the British and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>French,</v>

1562
01:31:34.581 --> 01:31:39.581
<v Speaker 4>the Americans understand that the enemy </v>
<v Speaker 4>needs to be seen as vile and dangerous </v>

1563
01:31:39.891 --> 01:31:44.891
<v Speaker 4>and blood thirsty and is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Comical because he said the problem </v>

1564
01:31:44.891 --> 01:31:49.121
<v Speaker 4>with portraying them as comical as you </v>
<v Speaker 4>run up against them and they're tough </v>

1565
01:31:49.121 --> 01:31:50.000
<v Speaker 4>and that seems to shatter all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>propaganda.</v>

1566
01:31:50.001 --> 01:31:52.120
<v Speaker 4>It's better to say they're these evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1567
01:31:52.121 --> 01:31:54.830
<v Speaker 4>the nine riders have more door are </v>
<v Speaker 4>approaching.</v>

1568
01:31:54.831 --> 01:31:56.180
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you know,</v>

1569
01:31:56.181 --> 01:32:00.280
<v Speaker 4>you really get your back into a cause </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that and how the allies,</v>

1570
01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:03.670
<v Speaker 4>which is what Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>France and many other countries,</v>

1571
01:32:03.671 --> 01:32:08.671
<v Speaker 4>the United States later included,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will be called in this war there </v>

1572
01:32:08.671 --> 01:32:09.460
<v Speaker 4>initially called the triple entente.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other side,</v>

1573
01:32:09.461 --> 01:32:12.010
<v Speaker 4>the alliance with Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Austria,</v>

1574
01:32:12.011 --> 01:32:17.011
<v Speaker 4>hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Later Turkey and some other countries </v>

1575
01:32:17.011 --> 01:32:17.011
<v Speaker 4>will be called the central powers.</v>

1576
01:32:17.011 --> 01:32:19.360
<v Speaker 4>And so it's the triple entente against </v>
<v Speaker 4>the central powers or the allies against</v>

1577
01:32:19.361 --> 01:32:22.990
<v Speaker 4>the central powers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the central powers will be portrayed</v>

1578
01:32:22.991 --> 01:32:27.991
<v Speaker 4>just as Hitler said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as these rapers and pillagers and </v>

1579
01:32:27.991 --> 01:32:31.681
<v Speaker 4>looters and it will be in Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That the Germans will provide their </v>

1580
01:32:31.681 --> 01:32:36.661
<v Speaker 4>opponents with the raw materials to not </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to exaggerate too much at all to </v>

1581
01:32:37.331 --> 01:32:40.630
<v Speaker 4>portray them as the modern day version </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the huns.</v>

1582
01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:46.180
<v Speaker 4>Now on August first 19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>14,</v>

1583
01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:51.780
<v Speaker 4>this small war between the ostrow </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hungarians and the Serbs gets bigger </v>

1584
01:32:54.700 --> 01:32:59.700
<v Speaker 4>because that's when the German ultimatum</v>
<v Speaker 4>given to the Russians telling them to </v>

1585
01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:02.020
<v Speaker 4>stop their mobilization or else runs </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

1586
01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:07.860
<v Speaker 4>Historian David Stevenson says that this</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a clear sign that the Russians know </v>

1587
01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:11.740
<v Speaker 4>what's coming and they're okay with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know that if they don't stand down,</v>

1588
01:33:11.741 --> 01:33:14.410
<v Speaker 4>they'll have war with Germany and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't stand down,</v>

1589
01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:18.790
<v Speaker 4>so he says one way or another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to infer that the Russians were</v>

1590
01:33:18.791 --> 01:33:20.110
<v Speaker 4>ready for this and okay with it.</v>

1591
01:33:21.190 --> 01:33:26.190
<v Speaker 4>So on August first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Germans declare war on the Russians </v>

1592
01:33:26.190 --> 01:33:27.340
<v Speaker 4>that day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Italy says they're out.</v>

1593
01:33:27.670 --> 01:33:30.250
<v Speaker 4>They had a nominal alliance with Germany</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Austria,</v>

1594
01:33:30.251 --> 01:33:35.251
<v Speaker 4>Hungary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they choose to use an out clause </v>

1595
01:33:35.251 --> 01:33:36.040
<v Speaker 4>which may or may not be valid depending </v>
<v Speaker 4>on who you're talking to,</v>

1596
01:33:36.250 --> 01:33:41.250
<v Speaker 4>saying that this appears to be an </v>
<v Speaker 4>aggressive war and their alliance only </v>

1597
01:33:41.250 --> 01:33:41.680
<v Speaker 4>covers defensive war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they're out.</v>

1598
01:33:41.770 --> 01:33:44.230
<v Speaker 4>They declared that they are neutral in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this new conflict.</v>

1599
01:33:44.231 --> 01:33:48.610
<v Speaker 4>It's just starting the next day in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>West.</v>

1600
01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:51.820
<v Speaker 4>Germany invades the neutral country of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Luxembourg,</v>

1601
01:33:51.821 --> 01:33:53.860
<v Speaker 4>the tiny little neutral country of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Luxembourg.</v>

1602
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:57.720
<v Speaker 4>And at the same time issues this </v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimatum to the Belgians saying,</v>

1603
01:33:57.730 --> 01:34:02.730
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just need to use your country to get </v>

1604
01:34:02.730 --> 01:34:02.730
<v Speaker 4>to France.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1605
01:34:02.730 --> 01:34:03.370
<v Speaker 4>we mean you no harm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just let us march through.</v>

1606
01:34:03.371 --> 01:34:05.350
<v Speaker 4>If we break anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll pay for it later and we don't have</v>

1607
01:34:05.351 --> 01:34:08.980
<v Speaker 4>any designs on your country longterm in </v>
<v Speaker 4>response to this.</v>

1608
01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:12.700
<v Speaker 4>The Belgians have a heroic moment where </v>
<v Speaker 4>the king of Belgium,</v>

1609
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1610
01:34:13.441 --> 01:34:16.990
<v Speaker 4>and the major officials all get together</v>
<v Speaker 4>and basically all agree that they're not</v>

1611
01:34:16.991 --> 01:34:21.991
<v Speaker 4>going to stand down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The attitude they seem to have is we're </v>

1612
01:34:21.991 --> 01:34:25.711
<v Speaker 4>screwed either way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We might as well go out of this </v>

1613
01:34:25.711 --> 01:34:28.531
<v Speaker 4>gloriously and they decide to mobilize </v>
<v Speaker 4>their tiny little army and fight and at </v>

1614
01:34:28.531 --> 01:34:32.641
<v Speaker 4>the same time issue the calls to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other guarantors of their neutrality </v>

1615
01:34:32.641 --> 01:34:33.130
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1616
01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:38.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they waited until the moment the </v>

1617
01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:38.340
<v Speaker 4>Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

1618
01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:41.101
<v Speaker 4>stepped in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's worried that somebody's </v>

1619
01:34:41.101 --> 01:34:42.820
<v Speaker 4>going to pull a fast one and try to feel</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that the French are worried the </v>

1620
01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:46.051
<v Speaker 4>Germans are going to try to fake them </v>
<v Speaker 4>into going into Belgium first because </v>

1621
01:34:46.051 --> 01:34:47.560
<v Speaker 4>they think the Germans are coming in and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the Germans can say,</v>

1622
01:34:47.561 --> 01:34:49.300
<v Speaker 4>we weren't the first people to violate </v>
<v Speaker 4>Belgium.</v>

1623
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:52.450
<v Speaker 4>Everybody wants to stay on the good side</v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of war,</v>

1624
01:34:52.451 --> 01:34:57.451
<v Speaker 4>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The French are so worried about falling </v>

1625
01:34:57.451 --> 01:35:00.181
<v Speaker 4>into a trap like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They pulled unprecedented move of all </v>

1626
01:35:00.181 --> 01:35:03.491
<v Speaker 4>time and on the eve of war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pulled their military forces six miles </v>

1627
01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:06.470
<v Speaker 4>back from the border.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember,</v>

1628
01:35:06.471 --> 01:35:11.471
<v Speaker 4>that's not just forward positioning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are troops who picked the spots </v>

1629
01:35:11.471 --> 01:35:13.730
<v Speaker 4>that they were in because they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>important strategic spots,</v>

1630
01:35:13.731 --> 01:35:18.731
<v Speaker 4>important passes and river crossings and</v>
<v Speaker 4>other things that have been built up </v>

1631
01:35:18.731 --> 01:35:21.851
<v Speaker 4>with fortifications for years and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>French government is so freaked out </v>

1632
01:35:21.851 --> 01:35:25.931
<v Speaker 4>about possibly being blamed for starting</v>
<v Speaker 4>this and the Germans not being blamed </v>

1633
01:35:25.931 --> 01:35:27.830
<v Speaker 4>for starting this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they pull their forces back.</v>

1634
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:30.320
<v Speaker 4>The French generals are not pleased </v>
<v Speaker 4>about this,</v>

1635
01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:35.560
<v Speaker 4>but the move is intended to also make </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure that the British people and the </v>

1636
01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:37.280
<v Speaker 4>peace faction in Britain have no excuse </v>
<v Speaker 4>to say,</v>

1637
01:35:37.281 --> 01:35:42.281
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>French violated Belgian neutrality </v>

1638
01:35:42.281 --> 01:35:42.281
<v Speaker 4>first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or shots were fired by the French first,</v>

1639
01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:48.040
<v Speaker 4>so the Germans are positioned into this </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing where they have a time limit on </v>

1640
01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:48.040
<v Speaker 4>this deal.</v>

1641
01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:51.940
<v Speaker 4>They can't sit around and wait around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Belgium has to be violated for the plan </v>

1642
01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:53.060
<v Speaker 4>to work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't get the French or the British</v>

1643
01:35:53.061 --> 01:35:54.470
<v Speaker 4>to violate Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First.</v>

1644
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:56.660
<v Speaker 4>They tell the Belgians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1645
01:35:56.661 --> 01:36:01.340
<v Speaker 4>to let them through the Belgian say no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and on August third,</v>

1646
01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:05.540
<v Speaker 4>Germany declares war on France and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Belgium.</v>

1647
01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:09.980
<v Speaker 4>Now think about that folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A week ago,</v>

1648
01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:15.160
<v Speaker 4>Europe was peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now it's on the slide to general war.</v>

1649
01:36:15.591 --> 01:36:20.591
<v Speaker 4>Within another week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire continent is going to be </v>

1650
01:36:20.591 --> 01:36:20.591
<v Speaker 4>flaming out at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1651
01:36:20.591 --> 01:36:24.821
<v Speaker 4>that's crazy to go from total peace to </v>
<v Speaker 4>total war in less than two weeks.</v>

1652
01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:30.640
<v Speaker 4>Hg Wells writing a year or two after the</v>
<v Speaker 4>conflict ends.</v>

1653
01:36:30.641 --> 01:36:32.180
<v Speaker 4>So He's right in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment.</v>

1654
01:36:32.181 --> 01:36:33.530
<v Speaker 4>He even says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't quite,</v>

1655
01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:36.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't write about it now without the</v>

1656
01:36:36.381 --> 01:36:38.090
<v Speaker 4>passions and the feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1657
01:36:38.091 --> 01:36:40.310
<v Speaker 4>totally screwing up your impression of </v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

1658
01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:45.490
<v Speaker 4>but he does talk about how weird the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mood was because all this was happening </v>

1659
01:36:45.490 --> 01:36:49.811
<v Speaker 4>so fast and he was talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>British public because that's where he </v>

1660
01:36:49.811 --> 01:36:52.511
<v Speaker 4>lived and how there was almost this </v>
<v Speaker 4>disconnect between the fact that the </v>

1661
01:36:52.511 --> 01:36:57.101
<v Speaker 4>entire world has changed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's happening so fast we haven't </v>

1662
01:36:57.101 --> 01:36:57.350
<v Speaker 4>changed with it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he writes,</v>

1663
01:36:57.351 --> 01:37:02.351
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all Europe still remembers the strange </v>

1664
01:37:02.351 --> 01:37:03.830
<v Speaker 4>atmosphere of those eventful sunny </v>
<v Speaker 4>August days.</v>

1665
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:07.730
<v Speaker 4>The end of the armed piece for nearly </v>
<v Speaker 4>half a century,</v>

1666
01:37:07.731 --> 01:37:10.850
<v Speaker 4>the western world had been tranquil and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it seemed safe.</v>

1667
01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:16.120
<v Speaker 4>Only a few middle aged and ageing people</v>
<v Speaker 4>in France had had any practical </v>

1668
01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:19.871
<v Speaker 4>experience of warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The newspapers spoke of a world </v>

1669
01:37:19.871 --> 01:37:21.020
<v Speaker 4>catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that conveyed very little meaning to</v>

1670
01:37:21.021 --> 01:37:23.300
<v Speaker 4>those for whom the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It always seems secure,</v>

1671
01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:28.540
<v Speaker 4>who were indeed almost incapable of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking of it as anything otherwise </v>

1672
01:37:28.540 --> 01:37:31.310
<v Speaker 4>then secure in Britain particularly for </v>
<v Speaker 4>some weeks,</v>

1673
01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:35.120
<v Speaker 4>the peace time routine continued in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>slightly dazed fashion.</v>

1674
01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:37.910
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like a man still walking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world,</v>

1675
01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:43.080
<v Speaker 4>unaware that he has contracted a fatal </v>
<v Speaker 4>disease which will alter every routine </v>

1676
01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:47.531
<v Speaker 4>and habit in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People went on with their summer </v>

1677
01:37:47.531 --> 01:37:47.531
<v Speaker 4>holidays,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shops,</v>

1678
01:37:47.531 --> 01:37:50.210
<v Speaker 4>reassured their customers with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>announcement business as usual.</v>

1679
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:52.880
<v Speaker 4>There was much talk and excitement when </v>
<v Speaker 4>the newspapers came,</v>

1680
01:37:53.090 --> 01:37:56.340
<v Speaker 4>but it was the talk and excitement of </v>
<v Speaker 4>spectators have no vivid</v>

1681
01:37:56.340 --> 01:38:01.340
<v Speaker 2>sense of participation in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe that was presently to </v>

1682
01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:02.400
<v Speaker 2>involve them all and quote.</v>

1683
01:38:03.770 --> 01:38:08.770
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to understand too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why the British public really weren't </v>

1684
01:38:08.770 --> 01:38:08.780
<v Speaker 2>ready for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1685
01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:11.690
<v Speaker 2>none of the British were really ready </v>
<v Speaker 2>for this.</v>

1686
01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:16.780
<v Speaker 2>They hadn't been mentally prepped for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that this was coming for all </v>

1687
01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:20.831
<v Speaker 2>sorts of political reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The British government couldn't declare </v>

1688
01:38:20.831 --> 01:38:23.600
<v Speaker 2>itself outright and sort of draw a line </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sand and tell the Germans,</v>

1689
01:38:23.601 --> 01:38:24.710
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you invade Belgium,</v>

1690
01:38:24.711 --> 01:38:26.090
<v Speaker 2>it's on no ifs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ands,</v>

1691
01:38:26.091 --> 01:38:31.091
<v Speaker 2>or buts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The British prime minister didn't have </v>

1692
01:38:31.091 --> 01:38:33.611
<v Speaker 2>that power for all he knew the piece </v>
<v Speaker 2>faction in his government would topple </v>

1693
01:38:33.611 --> 01:38:36.511
<v Speaker 2>is government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a statement like that were made and </v>

1694
01:38:36.511 --> 01:38:39.850
<v Speaker 2>both the French and the Germans for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>very long time before this conflict </v>

1695
01:38:39.850 --> 01:38:40.640
<v Speaker 2>breaks out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but especially in the fevered,</v>

1696
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:45.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last month are trying to get some sort </v>

1697
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:45.910
<v Speaker 2>of word from Great Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the policy is,</v>

1698
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:46.730
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do at the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute?</v>

1699
01:38:46.731 --> 01:38:48.890
<v Speaker 2>The French are sure the British are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to abandon them.</v>

1700
01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:53.590
<v Speaker 2>The French foreign minister will sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>down and discuss it at one point and say</v>

1701
01:38:53.591 --> 01:38:57.100
<v Speaker 2>they're going to desert us and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone in the British media asked him,</v>

1702
01:38:57.101 --> 01:38:57.760
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

1703
01:38:57.761 --> 01:39:00.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to wait to see if Britain </v>
<v Speaker 2>still has any honor.</v>

1704
01:39:02.630 --> 01:39:07.630
<v Speaker 2>The British are waiting for something to</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen in Belgium and somewhere the </v>

1705
01:39:07.630 --> 01:39:11.141
<v Speaker 2>Belgians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to do anything until </v>

1706
01:39:11.141 --> 01:39:13.601
<v Speaker 2>their actual neutrality is violated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they wait until the Germans arrived </v>

1707
01:39:13.601 --> 01:39:17.500
<v Speaker 2>when the advance cavalry patrols and </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually some guys on bicycles believed </v>

1708
01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:21.971
<v Speaker 2>or non pedal into Belgium and give </v>
<v Speaker 2>notices to the locals that we're sorry </v>

1709
01:39:21.971 --> 01:39:24.560
<v Speaker 2>that we have to do this and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything will be fine.</v>

1710
01:39:24.561 --> 01:39:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Just don't cause any trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't blow up any bridges.</v>

1711
01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:32.320
<v Speaker 2>Don't sabotage any railways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't destroy any tunnels,</v>

1712
01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:34.370
<v Speaker 2>anything we might need to get from here </v>
<v Speaker 2>to there,</v>

1713
01:39:34.610 --> 01:39:38.150
<v Speaker 2>leave all that in place or those will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>considered hostile acts.</v>

1714
01:39:38.540 --> 01:39:42.200
<v Speaker 2>As soon as it becomes apparent that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germans are on Belgian soil,</v>

1715
01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:47.560
<v Speaker 2>the king of Belgium basically orders </v>
<v Speaker 2>that all those things be done and then </v>

1716
01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:49.820
<v Speaker 2>he contacts the other guarantors of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Belgian neutrality and says,</v>

1717
01:39:50.330 --> 01:39:51.410
<v Speaker 2>the Germans are here.</v>

1718
01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:56.680
<v Speaker 2>We need your help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when the British draw up the </v>

1719
01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:58.880
<v Speaker 2>official sort of ultimatum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which people have criticized them for.</v>

1720
01:39:58.881 --> 01:40:03.881
<v Speaker 2>I mean they say if you don't only give </v>
<v Speaker 2>him that ultimatum before the Germans </v>

1721
01:40:03.881 --> 01:40:06.971
<v Speaker 2>had gone into Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might've had more options once </v>

1722
01:40:06.971 --> 01:40:08.690
<v Speaker 2>they're in Belgium for them to get out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Belgium because the British told them</v>

1723
01:40:08.691 --> 01:40:11.600
<v Speaker 2>to was really like a tail between their </v>
<v Speaker 2>legs kind of situation.</v>

1724
01:40:11.601 --> 01:40:16.601
<v Speaker 2>And this has happened in history many </v>
<v Speaker 2>times in other situations where people </v>

1725
01:40:16.601 --> 01:40:17.750
<v Speaker 2>have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had just said what you were going</v>

1726
01:40:17.751 --> 01:40:21.710
<v Speaker 2>to do before the enemy did what they did</v>
<v Speaker 2>might've been a different outcome.</v>

1727
01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:24.500
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once the Germans are in Belgium,</v>

1728
01:40:25.010 --> 01:40:29.690
<v Speaker 2>the British ambassador to Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy named Sir Edward Goshen,</v>

1729
01:40:29.930 --> 01:40:34.930
<v Speaker 2>delivers the British ultimatum to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany and he delivers it into the </v>

1730
01:40:34.930 --> 01:40:37.580
<v Speaker 2>hands of the German minister,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy named Godly Vanya Ego,</v>

1731
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:40.670
<v Speaker 2>and the German chancellor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guiding theobold bond.</v>

1732
01:40:40.670 --> 01:40:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Beckman Halweg and Gosha knew that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a historic meeting and he wrote down</v>

1733
01:40:46.521 --> 01:40:51.521
<v Speaker 2>what happened and he said the Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they received this ultimatum from </v>

1734
01:40:51.521 --> 01:40:52.280
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>freaked out.</v>

1735
01:40:53.110 --> 01:40:56.590
<v Speaker 2>You wrote that the meeting was fraught </v>
<v Speaker 2>with menace quote.</v>

1736
01:40:57.070 --> 01:41:00.140
<v Speaker 2>I found the chancellor very agitated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His excellence.</v>

1737
01:41:00.141 --> 01:41:03.610
<v Speaker 2>He at once began a harangue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which lasted for about 20 minutes.</v>

1738
01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:08.820
<v Speaker 2>He said that the step taken by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>British government was terrible to a </v>

1739
01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:12.661
<v Speaker 2>degree just for a word neutrality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a word which in war time it's so often </v>

1740
01:41:12.701 --> 01:41:15.370
<v Speaker 2>been disregarded just for a scrap of </v>
<v Speaker 2>paper.</v>

1741
01:41:15.371 --> 01:41:20.371
<v Speaker 2>Great Britain was going to make war on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>kindred nation who desired nothing </v>

1742
01:41:20.371 --> 01:41:24.541
<v Speaker 2>better than to be friends with her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All his efforts in that direction had </v>

1743
01:41:24.541 --> 01:41:25.360
<v Speaker 2>been rendered useless by this last </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible step,</v>

1744
01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:30.600
<v Speaker 2>and the policy to which as I knew he had</v>
<v Speaker 2>devoted himself since is a session to </v>

1745
01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:32.620
<v Speaker 2>office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had tumbled down like a house of cards.</v>

1746
01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:36.190
<v Speaker 2>What we had done was unthinkable in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>minds of the Germans.</v>

1747
01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:41.580
<v Speaker 2>It was like striking a man from behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>while he was fighting for his life </v>

1748
01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:44.791
<v Speaker 2>against two assailants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He yelled Great Britain responsible for </v>

1749
01:41:44.791 --> 01:41:44.800
<v Speaker 2>all the terrible events that might </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1750
01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:50.160
<v Speaker 2>I protested strongly against that </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement and said that in the same way </v>

1751
01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:53.050
<v Speaker 2>that he inherited don Diego wished me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that for strategical reasons,</v>

1752
01:41:53.051 --> 01:41:58.051
<v Speaker 2>it was a matter of life and death to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany to advance through Belgium and </v>

1753
01:41:58.051 --> 01:42:01.291
<v Speaker 2>violate the ladders neutrality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I would wish them to understand that </v>

1754
01:42:01.291 --> 01:42:03.010
<v Speaker 2>it was so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a matter of life and death for the honor</v>

1755
01:42:03.011 --> 01:42:08.011
<v Speaker 2>of Great Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she should keep her Solomon </v>

1756
01:42:08.011 --> 01:42:10.191
<v Speaker 2>engagements to do our utmost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to defend Belgium's neutrality if </v>

1757
01:42:10.191 --> 01:42:13.171
<v Speaker 2>attacked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that solemn compact simply had to be </v>

1758
01:42:13.171 --> 01:42:16.201
<v Speaker 2>kept or what confidence could anyone </v>
<v Speaker 2>have in engagements given by Great </v>

1759
01:42:16.201 --> 01:42:16.201
<v Speaker 2>Britain in the future.</v>

1760
01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:20.770
<v Speaker 2>The chancellor said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at what price will that compact have</v>

1761
01:42:20.771 --> 01:42:25.771
<v Speaker 2>been kept?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As the British government thought of </v>

1762
01:42:25.771 --> 01:42:28.171
<v Speaker 2>that and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is an interesting key point </v>

1763
01:42:29.170 --> 01:42:34.170
<v Speaker 2>because I've often wondered if you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the principals who were the </v>

1764
01:42:34.170 --> 01:42:38.401
<v Speaker 2>decision makers in this conflict into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the future and show them some history </v>

1765
01:42:38.401 --> 01:42:41.110
<v Speaker 2>books and show them what had happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the winners.</v>

1766
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they would've found a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to avert what ended up happening because</v>

1767
01:42:46.150 --> 01:42:48.400
<v Speaker 2>it was more horrible than any of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>envisioned?</v>

1768
01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:52.810
<v Speaker 2>The German field marshal in charge of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the military affairs at this time.</v>

1769
01:42:52.811 --> 01:42:57.811
<v Speaker 2>Von Moltke famously said that this was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the struggle that would decide the </v>

1770
01:42:57.811 --> 01:43:01.030
<v Speaker 2>course of history for the next hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and he was absolutely right.</v>

1771
01:43:01.031 --> 01:43:06.031
<v Speaker 2>Maybe more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but had he known that this would mean </v>

1772
01:43:06.031 --> 01:43:09.850
<v Speaker 2>that Germany would be on the losing end </v>
<v Speaker 2>of two World Wars in the 20th century.</v>

1773
01:43:10.950 --> 01:43:11.890
<v Speaker 2>What do you think he would have done?</v>

1774
01:43:11.890 --> 01:43:16.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the situation now and imagine </v>

1775
01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:19.531
<v Speaker 2>Germany without having lost those two </v>
<v Speaker 2>world wars and how different they might </v>

1776
01:43:19.531 --> 01:43:22.540
<v Speaker 2>be today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are German historians who consider</v>

1777
01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:27.750
<v Speaker 2>this role of the iron dice as going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>war here is often referred to as one of </v>

1778
01:43:27.911 --> 01:43:32.911
<v Speaker 2>the great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>irresponsible gambles in all German </v>

1779
01:43:32.911 --> 01:43:35.671
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe the key element in the whole </v>

1780
01:43:35.671 --> 01:43:40.081
<v Speaker 2>affair was Britain's decision to involve</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself in the conflict because one can </v>

1781
01:43:40.571 --> 01:43:43.720
<v Speaker 2>make a very good case that if Britain </v>
<v Speaker 2>stands aside,</v>

1782
01:43:44.230 --> 01:43:46.600
<v Speaker 2>Germany wins this war that's about to </v>
<v Speaker 2>start.</v>

1783
01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have perhaps the greatest overall </v>

1784
01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:57.040
<v Speaker 2>superpower in the early 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 2>world lining up on the other side,</v>

1785
01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:02.790
<v Speaker 2>and to be truthful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Germans weren't really afraid of the</v>

1786
01:44:02.791 --> 01:44:04.740
<v Speaker 2>British army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1787
01:44:04.741 --> 01:44:09.741
<v Speaker 2>that's a small colonial force that by </v>
<v Speaker 2>German standards is relatively </v>

1788
01:44:09.991 --> 01:44:14.991
<v Speaker 2>insignificant or so they think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean bismarck had famously said when </v>

1789
01:44:14.991 --> 01:44:17.040
<v Speaker 2>an advisor had warned him that if you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to war with Britain,</v>

1790
01:44:17.041 --> 01:44:22.041
<v Speaker 2>they could use that wonderful naval </v>
<v Speaker 2>power to land their entire army on our </v>

1791
01:44:22.041 --> 01:44:23.250
<v Speaker 2>coastline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Bismark famously said,</v>

1792
01:44:23.251 --> 01:44:25.350
<v Speaker 2>if they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shall have them arrested.</v>

1793
01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Meaning he just send the police force </v>
<v Speaker 2>out to corral the British army.</v>

1794
01:44:29.791 --> 01:44:34.791
<v Speaker 2>That's how worried they were about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny little force that their army </v>

1795
01:44:34.791 --> 01:44:38.811
<v Speaker 2>dwarfed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were keenly aware that Britain </v>

1796
01:44:38.811 --> 01:44:41.100
<v Speaker 2>had the greatest navy by far in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1797
01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:44.370
<v Speaker 2>They were the greatest financial power </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

1798
01:44:44.730 --> 01:44:47.670
<v Speaker 2>They controlled a huge chunk of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1799
01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Britain and France together owned about </v>
<v Speaker 2>70 percent of the world at this time </v>

1800
01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:55.350
<v Speaker 2>period when you talk about all their </v>
<v Speaker 2>colonies and everything else,</v>

1801
01:44:55.351 --> 01:44:58.950
<v Speaker 2>and that's all stuff that they can draw </v>
<v Speaker 2>on to fight the war.</v>

1802
01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:04.280
<v Speaker 2>What's more that wonderful navy have </v>
<v Speaker 2>Great Britain's can shut down German </v>

1803
01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:04.280
<v Speaker 2>shipping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1804
01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:09.091
<v Speaker 2>in a moment at a stroke of a pen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain's foreign secretary Sir Edward </v>

1805
01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Gray on August third,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

1806
01:45:11.341 --> 01:45:16.341
<v Speaker 2>14 when tensions have reached a knife </v>
<v Speaker 2>edge fever pitched moment.</v>

1807
01:45:16.890 --> 01:45:19.830
<v Speaker 2>We'll look out the window and see the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lamp.</v>

1808
01:45:19.831 --> 01:45:24.831
<v Speaker 2>Lighters of London lighting the lamps </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the evening as was customary at the </v>

1809
01:45:24.831 --> 01:45:28.311
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he turned to someone else at the </v>

1810
01:45:28.311 --> 01:45:30.300
<v Speaker 2>window and famously said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lamps are going out all over Europe.</v>

1811
01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:33.120
<v Speaker 2>We shall not see them lit again in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifetime.</v>

1812
01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:39.460
<v Speaker 2>The Germans are given the famous </v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimatum and it's set to expire at </v>

1813
01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:45.220
<v Speaker 2>midnight on August fourth German time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is 11:00</v>

1814
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:48.290
<v Speaker 2>PM British time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lloyd George,</v>

1815
01:45:48.291 --> 01:45:53.291
<v Speaker 2>one of the ministers says that they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting around a table just before the </v>

1816
01:45:53.391 --> 01:45:58.391
<v Speaker 2>stroke of 11 watching the clock tick </v>
<v Speaker 2>away and he said that his big bands </v>

1817
01:45:58.391 --> 01:46:03.370
<v Speaker 2>chime start shiming for the 11:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour signifying that the deadline is </v>

1818
01:46:03.370 --> 01:46:04.250
<v Speaker 2>about to expire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>

1819
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:07.430
<v Speaker 2>every ring of the bell sounded like </v>
<v Speaker 2>doom,</v>

1820
01:46:07.490 --> 01:46:09.020
<v Speaker 2>doom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doom,</v>

1821
01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:13.550
<v Speaker 2>and then when it expires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain declares war on Germany</v>

1822
01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:19.950
<v Speaker 2>and it's worth asking at this point what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who adjust,</v>

1823
01:46:20.290 --> 01:46:25.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>entered upon this course of action </v>

1824
01:46:25.290 --> 01:46:25.340
<v Speaker 2>thought was going to happen when Lloyd </v>
<v Speaker 2>George,</v>

1825
01:46:25.610 --> 01:46:27.860
<v Speaker 2>here's the chimes of big bend sounding </v>
<v Speaker 2>and things.</v>

1826
01:46:27.861 --> 01:46:32.000
<v Speaker 2>They sound like doom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does Lloyd George mean when he says</v>

1827
01:46:32.001 --> 01:46:37.001
<v Speaker 2>doom?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a conflict of the sort </v>

1828
01:46:37.001 --> 01:46:40.490
<v Speaker 2>that Europe had not had for 100 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of changed in 100 years.</v>

1829
01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:45.700
<v Speaker 2>This is like a jump off of a cliff in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dark for Europe and no one knows how</v>

1830
01:46:46.251 --> 01:46:50.190
<v Speaker 2>long the drop is going to be and they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been exposed to a lot of thinking</v>

1831
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:55.190
<v Speaker 4>out there by guys like Norman Angle we </v>
<v Speaker 4>mentioned earlier who were saying no </v>

1832
01:46:55.190 --> 01:46:57.090
<v Speaker 4>one's going to jump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jumping would be suicidal,</v>

1833
01:46:57.091 --> 01:46:59.250
<v Speaker 4>everybody die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The golden goose would be killed.</v>

1834
01:46:59.251 --> 01:47:01.140
<v Speaker 4>Globalization will be destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one will do it,</v>

1835
01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:05.190
<v Speaker 4>and now they had just done it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did people think that meant?</v>

1836
01:47:06.450 --> 01:47:07.410
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as we said earlier,</v>

1837
01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:10.310
<v Speaker 4>the first world war has so much written </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it that you can share.</v>

1838
01:47:10.311 --> 01:47:14.100
<v Speaker 4>We pick from this or that source and </v>
<v Speaker 4>create any sort of impression you want.</v>

1839
01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:16.740
<v Speaker 4>What it really looks like though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you sum up,</v>

1840
01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:21.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've read a bunch of stuff on this and </v>

1841
01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:23.361
<v Speaker 4>and to me what it looks like is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a small view amongst some </v>

1842
01:47:24.241 --> 01:47:29.241
<v Speaker 4>people that understood the reality and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they turn out to be the Cassandra's in </v>

1843
01:47:29.241 --> 01:47:29.650
<v Speaker 4>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1844
01:47:29.670 --> 01:47:33.810
<v Speaker 4>the ones who actually prophesies </v>
<v Speaker 4>accurately what's going to happen.</v>

1845
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:35.670
<v Speaker 4>Most of these people didn't have a clue.</v>

1846
01:47:35.670 --> 01:47:38.800
<v Speaker 4>I think Lloyd George,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he hears Big Ben Sounding Doom,</v>

1847
01:47:39.150 --> 01:47:44.150
<v Speaker 4>is worried about Britain's financial </v>
<v Speaker 4>sector and he had every reason to be by </v>

1848
01:47:44.150 --> 01:47:46.290
<v Speaker 4>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because a few days before when Austria,</v>

1849
01:47:46.291 --> 01:47:49.950
<v Speaker 4>Hungary declares war on Serbia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the markets around the world,</v>

1850
01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:51.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go crazy,</v>

1851
01:47:51.810 --> 01:47:54.030
<v Speaker 4>and in London,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the financial capital of the world,</v>

1852
01:47:54.090 --> 01:47:59.090
<v Speaker 4>Lloyd George is hearing from all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bankers and all the investors and all </v>

1853
01:47:59.090 --> 01:48:01.230
<v Speaker 4>these people that this is a crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will destroy Britain fiscally,</v>

1854
01:48:01.231 --> 01:48:06.231
<v Speaker 4>which sounds like the worst thing in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world until you fast forward the time </v>

1855
01:48:06.231 --> 01:48:07.320
<v Speaker 4>machine for years and see what's really </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to happen,</v>

1856
01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:12.620
<v Speaker 4>where you would have paid good money to </v>
<v Speaker 4>only have the financial system </v>

1857
01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:13.200
<v Speaker 4>collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing though,</v>

1858
01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:18.620
<v Speaker 4>there were people who turned out to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>right about how momentous this leap off </v>

1859
01:48:18.721 --> 01:48:20.940
<v Speaker 4>this cliff and how long the drop was </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be,</v>

1860
01:48:21.150 --> 01:48:24.150
<v Speaker 4>who turned out to be right and we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of hoping for it.</v>

1861
01:48:24.150 --> 01:48:25.890
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take for example,</v>

1862
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:29.730
<v Speaker 4>the guy who along with Karl Marx helped </v>
<v Speaker 4>create modern communism.</v>

1863
01:48:29.731 --> 01:48:34.731
<v Speaker 4>Friedrich Engels who in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>87 wrote about this coming conflict and </v>

1864
01:48:34.731 --> 01:48:39.471
<v Speaker 4>how terrible it was going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and of course you know in his mind </v>

1865
01:48:39.471 --> 01:48:43.670
<v Speaker 4>hoping for an overthrow of all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>existing regimes to be replaced by </v>

1866
01:48:43.670 --> 01:48:47.241
<v Speaker 4>communism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was sort of the silver lining in </v>

1867
01:48:47.241 --> 01:48:47.850
<v Speaker 4>this coming armageddon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Engels wrote quote,</v>

1868
01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:53.100
<v Speaker 4>I see a world war of never before seen </v>
<v Speaker 4>extension and intensity.</v>

1869
01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:57.660
<v Speaker 4>If the system of mutual outbidding in </v>
<v Speaker 4>armament carried to the extreme,</v>

1870
01:48:57.840 --> 01:49:02.840
<v Speaker 4>finally bears it's natural fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight to 10 million soldiers will </v>

1871
01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:06.831
<v Speaker 4>slaughter each other and strip you're a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bear as no swarm of locusts has ever </v>

1872
01:49:06.831 --> 01:49:09.870
<v Speaker 4>done before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The devastations of the 30 years' war,</v>

1873
01:49:10.050 --> 01:49:13.890
<v Speaker 4>condensed into three or four years and </v>
<v Speaker 4>spread all over the continent.</v>

1874
01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:15.600
<v Speaker 4>Famine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>epidemics,</v>

1875
01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:20.780
<v Speaker 4>General Barbara,</v>
<v Speaker 4>realization of armies and masses </v>

1876
01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:23.120
<v Speaker 4>provoked by sheer desperation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>utter chaos in our trade industry and </v>

1877
01:49:23.120 --> 01:49:27.921
<v Speaker 4>commerce ending in general bankruptcy </v>
<v Speaker 4>collapse of the old states in their </v>

1878
01:49:27.921 --> 01:49:32.031
<v Speaker 4>traditional wisdom in such a way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the crowns role in the gutter by the </v>

1879
01:49:32.031 --> 01:49:33.990
<v Speaker 4>dozens and there'll be nobody to pick </v>
<v Speaker 4>them up.</v>

1880
01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:39.380
<v Speaker 4>Absolute impossibility to foresee how </v>
<v Speaker 4>all this will end and who will be the </v>

1881
01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:40.770
<v Speaker 4>victors in that struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only one result,</v>

1882
01:49:40.771 --> 01:49:45.771
<v Speaker 4>absolutely certain general exhaustion </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the creation of circumstances for </v>

1883
01:49:45.771 --> 01:49:49.120
<v Speaker 4>the final victory of the working and </v>
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

1884
01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:54.750
<v Speaker 4>so there's your silver lining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you happen to be a communist </v>

1885
01:49:54.750 --> 01:49:57.211
<v Speaker 4>revolutionary and you want to see the </v>
<v Speaker 4>overthrow of governments and in one </v>

1886
01:49:57.211 --> 01:49:58.600
<v Speaker 4>sense angles will get what he wants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least in one country,</v>

1887
01:49:59.530 --> 01:50:01.450
<v Speaker 4>but he's not the only person that </v>
<v Speaker 4>precedes this.</v>

1888
01:50:01.810 --> 01:50:03.940
<v Speaker 4>Some of the best military minds of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1889
01:50:03.941 --> 01:50:08.941
<v Speaker 4>See it too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've told you about the field marshal </v>

1890
01:50:08.941 --> 01:50:10.420
<v Speaker 4>in charge of Germany's war effort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the man known as von Moltke,</v>

1891
01:50:11.110 --> 01:50:16.110
<v Speaker 4>but he is a pale shadow of his uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the man known as the elder von Moltke,</v>

1892
01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:22.920
<v Speaker 4>who commanded Prussian forces in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Franco Prussian war of 1878 slash 71 by </v>

1893
01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:27.391
<v Speaker 4>this time period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's retired and he's on the speaking </v>

1894
01:50:27.391 --> 01:50:30.001
<v Speaker 4>circuit in 1906.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He speaks to the German legislature and </v>

1895
01:50:30.001 --> 01:50:32.020
<v Speaker 4>he warns them what a modern war is going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be like.</v>

1896
01:50:34.090 --> 01:50:38.860
<v Speaker 4>The age of cabinet war is behind us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All we have now is people's war.</v>

1897
01:50:39.070 --> 01:50:44.070
<v Speaker 4>Gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the war that has been hanging over </v>

1898
01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:44.500
<v Speaker 4>our heads now for more than 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the sword of Damocles,</v>

1899
01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:49.740
<v Speaker 4>if this war breaks out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then its duration and its end will be </v>

1900
01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:52.951
<v Speaker 4>unforeseeable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the greatest powers of Europe armed as </v>

1901
01:50:52.951 --> 01:50:55.981
<v Speaker 4>never before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll be going into battle with each </v>

1902
01:50:55.981 --> 01:50:58.621
<v Speaker 4>other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not one of them can be crushed so </v>

1903
01:50:58.621 --> 01:50:58.810
<v Speaker 4>completely in one or two campaigns that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it will admit defeat,</v>

1904
01:50:59.050 --> 01:51:04.050
<v Speaker 4>that it will be compelled to conclude </v>
<v Speaker 4>piece under hard terms and that it will </v>

1905
01:51:04.050 --> 01:51:05.830
<v Speaker 4>not come back even if it is a year later</v>
<v Speaker 4>to renew the struggle.</v>

1906
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:11.070
<v Speaker 4>Gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it may be a wharf seven years or 30 </v>

1907
01:51:11.070 --> 01:51:12.640
<v Speaker 4>years duration and woe to him who sets </v>
<v Speaker 4>Europe a light,</v>

1908
01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:17.140
<v Speaker 4>who first puts the fuse to the powder </v>
<v Speaker 4>keg and quote,</v>

1909
01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:24.060
<v Speaker 4>this long drop in the dark is going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>set up the first.</v>

1910
01:51:24.580 --> 01:51:26.500
<v Speaker 4>If you want to use the boxing analogy </v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1911
01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:31.740
<v Speaker 4>the first heavyweight championship fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world has seen since Napoleon stay </v>

1912
01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:33.790
<v Speaker 4>100 years before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the interim,</v>

1913
01:51:33.791 --> 01:51:35.090
<v Speaker 4>you've had a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1914
01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:38.980
<v Speaker 4>one sided conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know a champion like Muhammad Ali or</v>

1915
01:51:38.981 --> 01:51:41.920
<v Speaker 4>Mike Tyson fighting a person you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>never heard of,</v>

1916
01:51:42.250 --> 01:51:47.250
<v Speaker 4>or you'll have something like the wars </v>
<v Speaker 4>between the United States and Spain over</v>

1917
01:51:47.771 --> 01:51:50.980
<v Speaker 4>Cuba and the Philippines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a rising soon to be first class</v>

1918
01:51:50.981 --> 01:51:55.981
<v Speaker 4>power against a declining soon to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>third class power or these great </v>

1919
01:51:55.981 --> 01:51:59.911
<v Speaker 4>colonial conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're a nation like Britain will go in </v>

1920
01:51:59.911 --> 01:52:02.740
<v Speaker 4>and crush the dervishes or the Zulus </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the occasional setback of course,</v>

1921
01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:06.640
<v Speaker 4>and they will use machine guns against </v>
<v Speaker 4>these natives.</v>

1922
01:52:06.641 --> 01:52:09.640
<v Speaker 4>Armed with spears,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of these machine guns,</v>

1923
01:52:09.641 --> 01:52:14.641
<v Speaker 4>really a gatling gun was called the </v>
<v Speaker 4>maximum gun and there was a famous </v>

1924
01:52:14.641 --> 01:52:16.480
<v Speaker 4>colonial era poem that said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever happens,</v>

1925
01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:21.510
<v Speaker 4>we have got the maximum gun and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have not in this upcoming war.</v>

1926
01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:24.790
<v Speaker 4>Both sides will have the maximum gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

1927
01:52:24.970 --> 01:52:29.970
<v Speaker 4>much more deadly modern versions of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>maxim gun that we call machine guns </v>

1928
01:52:29.970 --> 01:52:34.081
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one had ever seen a war where both </v>

1929
01:52:34.081 --> 01:52:36.991
<v Speaker 4>sides had machine guns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Franco Prussian war saw the French </v>

1930
01:52:36.991 --> 01:52:40.471
<v Speaker 4>trying to use these gatling guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these early machine guns as best they </v>

1931
01:52:40.471 --> 01:52:44.281
<v Speaker 4>could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no one really had any clue what to </v>

1932
01:52:44.281 --> 01:52:44.281
<v Speaker 4>do with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That had all changed by 1914.</v>

1933
01:52:44.410 --> 01:52:48.710
<v Speaker 4>We were seeing most professional armies </v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps that the world had ever seen and</v>

1934
01:52:48.711 --> 01:52:50.930
<v Speaker 4>certainly the largest that the world had</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever seen,</v>

1935
01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:56.260
<v Speaker 4>getting ready to clash in a conflict </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was going to be like jumping off a </v>

1936
01:52:56.260 --> 01:52:59.870
<v Speaker 4>cliff in the dark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody could foresee the end of this.</v>

1937
01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:05.320
<v Speaker 4>One thing was for sure the army for </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germany that is about to enter Belgium </v>

1938
01:53:06.650 --> 01:53:11.650
<v Speaker 4>is probably the greatest army that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world had seen up until that time,</v>

1939
01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:18.300
<v Speaker 4>and I say that with everyone knowing </v>
<v Speaker 4>what a big fan I am of the Mongol,</v>

1940
01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:22.790
<v Speaker 4>a military science and history and their</v>
<v Speaker 4>armies and they're wonderful,</v>

1941
01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:28.360
<v Speaker 4>but they get respect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People understand how incredibly </v>

1942
01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:31.751
<v Speaker 4>dominant the Mongols were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The army of Germany during this time </v>

1943
01:53:31.751 --> 01:53:31.751
<v Speaker 4>period,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Kaiser,</v>

1944
01:53:31.751 --> 01:53:36.341
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like the Rodney Dangerfield of </v>

1945
01:53:36.341 --> 01:53:36.341
<v Speaker 4>armies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't get any respect,</v>

1946
01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:39.350
<v Speaker 4>and yet they are maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1947
01:53:39.351 --> 01:53:43.310
<v Speaker 4>you create your top 10 list of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>greatest armies throughout all history,</v>

1948
01:53:43.311 --> 01:53:44.990
<v Speaker 4>and I put the Kaiser Right Carme on </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1949
01:53:45.290 --> 01:53:50.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure I put the German army from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Second World War on there and yet </v>

1950
01:53:50.290 --> 01:53:52.280
<v Speaker 4>part of the reason we don't know more </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that first World War German armies</v>

1951
01:53:52.281 --> 01:53:53.870
<v Speaker 4>because the Second World War German </v>
<v Speaker 4>army,</v>

1952
01:53:53.871 --> 01:53:58.340
<v Speaker 4>like so many things in that second </v>
<v Speaker 4>conflict overshadow it in many ways.</v>

1953
01:53:58.670 --> 01:54:03.670
<v Speaker 4>The Wehrmacht in the Second World War is</v>
<v Speaker 4>flashier than the first World War German</v>

1954
01:54:03.831 --> 01:54:05.170
<v Speaker 4>army,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1955
01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:10.330
<v Speaker 4>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get to the box and character </v>

1956
01:54:10.330 --> 01:54:11.861
<v Speaker 4>Richard's the Wehrmacht is a big heavy </v>
<v Speaker 4>hitter knockout artist and they go </v>

1957
01:54:11.861 --> 01:54:14.090
<v Speaker 4>around and it's just boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's over in one round sometimes and you</v>

1958
01:54:14.091 --> 01:54:15.890
<v Speaker 4>stand up and it's thrilling and </v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible,</v>

1959
01:54:15.891 --> 01:54:20.891
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once someone hits them back or or beats </v>

1960
01:54:20.891 --> 01:54:21.500
<v Speaker 4>them up a little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a different game and once you start</v>

1961
01:54:21.501 --> 01:54:26.501
<v Speaker 4>wearing them down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now you can continue to wear them down </v>

1962
01:54:26.501 --> 01:54:26.501
<v Speaker 4>because they're not strong.</v>

1963
01:54:26.501 --> 01:54:28.670
<v Speaker 4>Fundamentally at the core,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a great punch,</v>

1964
01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:32.480
<v Speaker 4>but they rest sort of on an uneven </v>
<v Speaker 4>foundation.</v>

1965
01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:37.100
<v Speaker 4>That was really where the strength of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the first World War army was.</v>

1966
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:40.400
<v Speaker 4>It may not have been as flashy with </v>
<v Speaker 4>those giant knockouts and all that,</v>

1967
01:54:40.401 --> 01:54:42.950
<v Speaker 4>but they had a better chin and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were,</v>

1968
01:54:43.250 --> 01:54:45.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they rested on from foundations.</v>

1969
01:54:45.051 --> 01:54:49.660
<v Speaker 4>It was a fantastic army and no one </v>
<v Speaker 4>remembers it today,</v>

1970
01:54:49.661 --> 01:54:54.661
<v Speaker 4>and what's funny is once again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just becomes another thing that I'd </v>

1971
01:54:54.661 --> 01:54:56.410
<v Speaker 4>off Hitler was wrong about when he </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrote,</v>

1972
01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:59.590
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years may pass,</v>

1973
01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:04.180
<v Speaker 4>but never will it be possible to speak </v>
<v Speaker 4>of heroism without mentioning the German</v>

1974
01:55:04.181 --> 01:55:07.600
<v Speaker 4>army in the world war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then from the veil of the past,</v>

1975
01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:12.720
<v Speaker 4>the iron front of the gray steel helmet </v>
<v Speaker 4>will emerge unwavering and unflinching </v>

1976
01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.450
<v Speaker 4>and immortal monument as long as there </v>
<v Speaker 4>are Germans alive.</v>

1977
01:55:16.570 --> 01:55:19.420
<v Speaker 4>They will remember that these men were </v>
<v Speaker 4>sons of their nation.</v>

1978
01:55:20.370 --> 01:55:20.920
<v Speaker 4>And to quote,</v>

1979
01:55:22.670 --> 01:55:27.670
<v Speaker 4>it's a fantastic army and part of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>makes it so great is this natural </v>

1980
01:55:28.161 --> 01:55:31.280
<v Speaker 4>efficiency that was almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>stereotypically German,</v>

1981
01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:36.700
<v Speaker 4>is applied to military science during a </v>
<v Speaker 4>time period where military science </v>

1982
01:55:36.700 --> 01:55:40.910
<v Speaker 4>really does become science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's become the age of the bean counters</v>

1983
01:55:40.911 --> 01:55:44.460
<v Speaker 4>and efficiency experts when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>putting an army in the field.</v>

1984
01:55:44.670 --> 01:55:49.470
<v Speaker 4>That's what the Napoleonic era creates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you get this first part of the war</v>

1985
01:55:49.471 --> 01:55:51.810
<v Speaker 4>machine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability to create these mass armies.</v>

1986
01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:57.380
<v Speaker 4>Now imagine a guy like Alexander the </v>
<v Speaker 4>great who I love to mention all the </v>

1987
01:55:57.380 --> 01:56:00.681
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can imagine Julius Caesar to </v>

1988
01:56:00.681 --> 01:56:00.900
<v Speaker 4>guys who probably never commanded more </v>
<v Speaker 4>than 80,000</v>

1989
01:56:00.901 --> 01:56:05.901
<v Speaker 4>people ever and who staffs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know we're capable and they could </v>

1990
01:56:05.901 --> 01:56:09.591
<v Speaker 4>deal with it and they were very </v>
<v Speaker 4>efficient logistically and everything </v>

1991
01:56:09.591 --> 01:56:10.770
<v Speaker 4>for their time period,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were dealing with 80,000</v>

1992
01:56:10.771 --> 01:56:15.771
<v Speaker 4>men in this era.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're dealing with 12 to 15 times that </v>

1993
01:56:17.581 --> 01:56:18.060
<v Speaker 4>amount.</v>

1994
01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:20.460
<v Speaker 4>What would alexander the great had done </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to,</v>

1995
01:56:20.730 --> 01:56:22.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>control one and a half million men.</v>

1996
01:56:23.310 --> 01:56:27.930
<v Speaker 4>It's an exercise in higher math to try </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do that.</v>

1997
01:56:28.170 --> 01:56:33.090
<v Speaker 4>And when you hear about how the Germans </v>
<v Speaker 4>had prepared minute Lee for this day,</v>

1998
01:56:33.091 --> 01:56:38.091
<v Speaker 4>that for so long had been called the day</v>
<v Speaker 4>dare tog this attack into Belgium into </v>

1999
01:56:38.161 --> 01:56:43.161
<v Speaker 4>overwhelm friends and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get an idea of how much actual bean </v>

2000
01:56:43.161 --> 01:56:46.260
<v Speaker 4>counting and planning is involved now in</v>
<v Speaker 4>order to maintain these armies.</v>

2001
01:56:46.261 --> 01:56:51.261
<v Speaker 4>That would have been impossible 150 </v>
<v Speaker 4>years before because this capability </v>

2002
01:56:51.261 --> 01:56:51.730
<v Speaker 4>didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2003
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:56.400
<v Speaker 4>it's a function of modern civilization </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the era of the 20th century.</v>

2004
01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:59.940
<v Speaker 4>Now you get an idea of size.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to think about the division,</v>

2005
01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:03.690
<v Speaker 4>which is the basic unit that these </v>
<v Speaker 4>militaries kinda operate with.</v>

2006
01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:08.910
<v Speaker 4>It goes back to Napoleonic times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Divisions are still used of course in </v>

2007
01:57:08.910 --> 01:57:10.230
<v Speaker 4>military is today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you want to think about 15,000</v>

2008
01:57:10.231 --> 01:57:12.600
<v Speaker 4>men in a division as a kind of a rough </v>
<v Speaker 4>size,</v>

2009
01:57:12.601 --> 01:57:14.970
<v Speaker 4>it actually fluctuates in different </v>
<v Speaker 4>militaries and whatnot,</v>

2010
01:57:14.971 --> 01:57:16.320
<v Speaker 4>but just think 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>men,</v>

2011
01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:20.730
<v Speaker 4>a $15,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>million division is probably more troops</v>

2012
01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:23.820
<v Speaker 4>than either the normans or the saxons </v>
<v Speaker 4>had at the battle of hastings,</v>

2013
01:57:23.821 --> 01:57:28.821
<v Speaker 4>the pivotal 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>66 panel that decided the fate of </v>

2014
01:57:28.821 --> 01:57:28.821
<v Speaker 4>Britain at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>England at the time.</v>

2015
01:57:29.610 --> 01:57:34.610
<v Speaker 4>So each division,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is equivalent to a rather nice </v>

2016
01:57:34.610 --> 01:57:37.491
<v Speaker 4>sized early medieval army.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The German army at the beginning of the </v>

2017
01:57:37.491 --> 01:57:41.691
<v Speaker 4>war has more than 80 of these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine trying to control 80 norman </v>

2018
01:57:41.691 --> 01:57:44.970
<v Speaker 4>armies and it's not just about getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>each division where it needs to go.</v>

2019
01:57:45.150 --> 01:57:47.760
<v Speaker 4>It's about sinking what they do </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

2020
01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:51.360
<v Speaker 4>When you start organizing divisions and </v>
<v Speaker 4>two cores and cores into armies,</v>

2021
01:57:51.630 --> 01:57:53.550
<v Speaker 4>then these armies have to support each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

2022
01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:58.640
<v Speaker 4>They have to travel on different roads </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then converge at certain points and </v>

2023
01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:02.181
<v Speaker 4>you have to think of the incredible math</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's involved in these march columns </v>

2024
01:58:02.181 --> 01:58:05.661
<v Speaker 4>and it's hard to get your mind around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but these units are so large and these </v>

2025
01:58:05.661 --> 01:58:07.320
<v Speaker 4>roads so narrow that when the head of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the column starts walking,</v>

2026
01:58:07.650 --> 01:58:12.650
<v Speaker 4>they've gone like 29 miles before the </v>
<v Speaker 4>end of the column can start walking.</v>

2027
01:58:13.590 --> 01:58:18.590
<v Speaker 4>Trying to plan to have food ready for </v>
<v Speaker 4>these guys when they stopped marching </v>

2028
01:58:18.590 --> 01:58:22.161
<v Speaker 4>and I mean it's the logistics of this is</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible and it's the main reason why </v>

2029
01:58:22.161 --> 01:58:23.490
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2030
01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:24.840
<v Speaker 4>ages and ages ago.</v>

2031
01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:29.840
<v Speaker 4>You just couldn't support it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In addition to all these armies are </v>

2032
01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:33.141
<v Speaker 4>fabulously trained.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Germans are incredibly trained in </v>

2033
01:58:33.141 --> 01:58:36.411
<v Speaker 4>terms of having even they're reservists </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the practice fields in Germany doing </v>

2034
01:58:37.051 --> 01:58:40.140
<v Speaker 4>live fire exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Preparing for this day.</v>

2035
01:58:41.530 --> 01:58:43.030
<v Speaker 4>This is what Barbara Tuchman writes </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

2036
01:58:43.220 --> 01:58:48.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it starts with mobilization and you get </v>

2037
01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:48.880
<v Speaker 4>an idea of how planned every step is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the German army quote,</v>

2038
01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:54.130
<v Speaker 4>once the mobilization button was pushed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole vast machinery for calling up,</v>

2039
01:58:54.250 --> 01:58:59.250
<v Speaker 4>equipping and transporting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>2 million men began turning </v>

2040
01:58:59.250 --> 01:59:02.821
<v Speaker 4>automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Reservists went to their designated </v>

2041
01:59:02.821 --> 01:59:02.821
<v Speaker 4>Depos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>were issued uniforms,</v>

2042
01:59:02.821 --> 01:59:07.620
<v Speaker 4>equipment and arms formed into companies</v>
<v Speaker 4>and companies into battalions were </v>

2043
01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:09.340
<v Speaker 4>joined by cavalry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cyclists,</v>

2044
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:11.260
<v Speaker 4>artillery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>medical units,</v>

2045
01:59:11.350 --> 01:59:13.420
<v Speaker 4>cook wagons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blacksmith wagons,</v>

2046
01:59:13.450 --> 01:59:18.450
<v Speaker 4>even postal wagons moved according to </v>
<v Speaker 4>prepared railway timetables to </v>

2047
01:59:18.450 --> 01:59:23.431
<v Speaker 4>concentration points near the frontier </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they would be formed into </v>

2048
01:59:23.431 --> 01:59:23.431
<v Speaker 4>divisions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>divisions,</v>

2049
01:59:23.431 --> 01:59:26.590
<v Speaker 4>into cores and cores into armies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ready to advance and fight.</v>

2050
01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:31.180
<v Speaker 4>One Army Corps alone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she writes out of the total of 40 in the</v>

2051
01:59:31.181 --> 01:59:36.181
<v Speaker 4>German forces,</v>
<v Speaker 4>required a hundred and 70 railway cars </v>

2052
01:59:36.181 --> 01:59:38.530
<v Speaker 4>for officers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>965 for infantry,</v>

2053
01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:41.470
<v Speaker 4>2,960</v>
<v Speaker 4>for cavalry.</v>

2054
01:59:41.650 --> 01:59:45.640
<v Speaker 4>Nineteen hundred and 15 for artillery </v>
<v Speaker 4>and supply wagons.</v>

2055
01:59:45.790 --> 01:59:50.710
<v Speaker 4>Six thousand and 10 in all grouped in </v>
<v Speaker 4>140 trains and an equal number.</v>

2056
01:59:50.711 --> 01:59:53.980
<v Speaker 4>Again for their supplies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>From the moment the order was given,</v>

2057
01:59:53.981 --> 01:59:58.981
<v Speaker 4>she writes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything was to move at fixed times </v>

2058
01:59:58.981 --> 02:00:02.041
<v Speaker 4>according to a schedule precise down to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the number of train axles that would </v>

2059
02:00:02.041 --> 02:00:03.550
<v Speaker 4>pass over a given bridge within a given </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2060
02:00:04.260 --> 02:00:09.260
<v Speaker 4>And to quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you realize how my noodly planned </v>

2061
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:11.350
<v Speaker 4>and how you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>punctual,</v>

2062
02:00:11.351 --> 02:00:14.020
<v Speaker 4>this whole thing must be in order to </v>
<v Speaker 4>function.</v>

2063
02:00:14.230 --> 02:00:16.900
<v Speaker 4>You can see why delays of even a few </v>
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>

2064
02:00:16.901 --> 02:00:19.150
<v Speaker 4>We'll throw your whole timetable off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2065
02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:20.830
<v Speaker 4>right before this whole conflict breaks </v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

2066
02:00:20.831 --> 02:00:25.831
<v Speaker 4>and I mentioned it earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Kaiser will turn to von Moltke and </v>

2067
02:00:25.831 --> 02:00:25.831
<v Speaker 4>he's panicking at the last minute.</v>

2068
02:00:25.831 --> 02:00:28.780
<v Speaker 4>The Great Supreme Warrior leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not so tough when it all looks like it's</v>

2069
02:00:28.781 --> 02:00:31.660
<v Speaker 4>coming down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unfortunately for him or fortunately for</v>

2070
02:00:31.661 --> 02:00:34.210
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the staff that works under him are tough</v>

2071
02:00:34.211 --> 02:00:35.050
<v Speaker 4>as nails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2072
02:00:35.051 --> 02:00:37.660
<v Speaker 4>another thing is German army,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this period brought to the table,</v>

2073
02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:40.870
<v Speaker 4>which to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the second one did most of the time too.</v>

2074
02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:46.140
<v Speaker 4>It's fantastic leadership and the Kaiser</v>
<v Speaker 4>at one point thinks the war was </v>

2075
02:00:46.140 --> 02:00:46.140
<v Speaker 4>Britain's off and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great,</v>

2076
02:00:46.140 --> 02:00:47.620
<v Speaker 4>we can turn the armies around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2077
02:00:47.621 --> 02:00:52.621
<v Speaker 4>just send them to Russia instead of </v>
<v Speaker 4>worrying about France and England at </v>

2078
02:00:52.621 --> 02:00:52.621
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and von Moltke has to stop him and say,</v>

2079
02:00:52.621 --> 02:00:55.840
<v Speaker 4>you do not improvise the deployment of </v>
<v Speaker 4>millions.</v>

2080
02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:02.040
<v Speaker 4>I think the exact line was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>deployment of millions cannot be </v>

2081
02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:02.040
<v Speaker 4>improvised,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you get the point.</v>

2082
02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:07.020
<v Speaker 4>This was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an efficient plan to deploy the largest </v>

2083
02:01:07.020 --> 02:01:11.200
<v Speaker 4>number of people that had ever been sent</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a single area for a single purpose.</v>

2084
02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:16.200
<v Speaker 4>Probably in all human history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think about Napoleon's greatest </v>

2085
02:01:17.080 --> 02:01:18.850
<v Speaker 4>outrageous gamble,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2086
02:01:18.851 --> 02:01:22.510
<v Speaker 4>To invade Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>utilizing an army composed of many,</v>

2087
02:01:22.511 --> 02:01:24.820
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many different European peoples.</v>

2088
02:01:24.970 --> 02:01:27.040
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had to scrape Germany and every place</v>

2089
02:01:27.041 --> 02:01:32.041
<v Speaker 4>else to get enough people to send into </v>
<v Speaker 4>Russia with something that was called </v>

2090
02:01:32.041 --> 02:01:32.041
<v Speaker 4>the grand army.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2091
02:01:32.041 --> 02:01:36.991
<v Speaker 4>in the early 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was this crazy endeavor sent </v>

2092
02:01:36.991 --> 02:01:40.650
<v Speaker 4>maybe 750,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>men into the Germans were going to </v>

2093
02:01:40.971 --> 02:01:45.500
<v Speaker 4>invade Belgium with more than twice that</v>
<v Speaker 4>in and outflanking maneuver.</v>

2094
02:01:46.190 --> 02:01:48.020
<v Speaker 4>That's not even the army.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's holding the front,</v>

2095
02:01:48.110 --> 02:01:51.320
<v Speaker 4>that's just a big wide swinging gate </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's going to smash on top of the head</v>

2096
02:01:51.321 --> 02:01:55.190
<v Speaker 4>of France.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you control that many people?</v>

2097
02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:57.830
<v Speaker 4>How do you even get them from one place </v>
<v Speaker 4>to another?</v>

2098
02:01:57.831 --> 02:02:01.340
<v Speaker 4>We kind of seem to think in our head </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they can just march across,</v>

2099
02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:06.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mountain sides and country lanes and </v>

2100
02:02:06.500 --> 02:02:06.620
<v Speaker 4>through fields and pastures and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they do,</v>

2101
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:11.060
<v Speaker 4>but most of the time they get to places </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same way most of us do.</v>

2102
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:16.270
<v Speaker 4>They utilize the road system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about what the road system in </v>

2103
02:02:16.270 --> 02:02:17.450
<v Speaker 4>Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tiny little,</v>

2104
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:22.750
<v Speaker 4>mostly rural Belgium is going to be like</v>
<v Speaker 4>with this massive greatest sized army </v>

2105
02:02:23.331 --> 02:02:28.331
<v Speaker 4>probably ever put together trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>march through it all in a short period </v>

2106
02:02:28.331 --> 02:02:30.620
<v Speaker 4>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were witnesses,</v>

2107
02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:32.570
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to this actually happening.</v>

2108
02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:38.800
<v Speaker 4>One of the fun ones to read for me is </v>
<v Speaker 4>Richard Harding Davis because Davis is </v>

2109
02:02:39.381 --> 02:02:41.060
<v Speaker 4>one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's an American.</v>

2110
02:02:41.330 --> 02:02:42.180
<v Speaker 4>He also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2111
02:02:42.190 --> 02:02:44.210
<v Speaker 4>he's basically the war correspondent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2112
02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:49.240
<v Speaker 4>one of the main ones of his era and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrote about the deployment of American </v>

2113
02:02:49.240 --> 02:02:49.260
<v Speaker 4>forces in Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2114
02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:51.140
<v Speaker 4>at the turn of the century and all this </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of stuff and he's,</v>

2115
02:02:51.290 --> 02:02:54.770
<v Speaker 4>he's really a Rah Rah America Kinda guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2116
02:02:54.771 --> 02:02:57.410
<v Speaker 4>Americans the best at everything and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that sort of feeling.</v>

2117
02:02:57.950 --> 02:03:02.950
<v Speaker 4>But he was there in Belgium as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>German army comes through and you can,</v>

2118
02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:08.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to read you this extensively </v>

2119
02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:10.781
<v Speaker 4>because you can hear in his writing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his jaw is on the floor and here's </v>

2120
02:03:10.851 --> 02:03:15.851
<v Speaker 4>someone who doesn't think anybody does </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything better than America and he's </v>

2121
02:03:15.851 --> 02:03:19.160
<v Speaker 4>getting a lesson in what the best army </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the world looks like.</v>

2122
02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:24.550
<v Speaker 4>And remember this kind of force at this </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of level and potency hasn't been on</v>

2123
02:03:24.771 --> 02:03:29.570
<v Speaker 4>display in anyone's living memory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're getting a view of a nation at war</v>

2124
02:03:29.571 --> 02:03:34.571
<v Speaker 4>like you in Napoleonic times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but marched and equipped and organized </v>

2125
02:03:34.571 --> 02:03:36.560
<v Speaker 4>and supported by a modern 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 4>state.</v>

2126
02:03:36.561 --> 02:03:41.561
<v Speaker 4>This was while you were beginning to see</v>
<v Speaker 4>a tiny little glimmer of what the leap </v>

2127
02:03:41.561 --> 02:03:46.541
<v Speaker 4>in the dark was going to entail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was going to entail fighting armies </v>

2128
02:03:46.541 --> 02:03:48.890
<v Speaker 4>like this one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Richard Harding Davis writes,</v>

2129
02:03:48.891 --> 02:03:53.891
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the entrance of the German army into </v>

2130
02:03:53.891 --> 02:03:56.730
<v Speaker 4>Brussels has lost the human quality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was lost as soon as the three </v>

2131
02:03:56.730 --> 02:03:59.330
<v Speaker 4>soldiers who led the army bicycled into </v>
<v Speaker 4>the boulevard,</v>

2132
02:03:59.331 --> 02:04:04.331
<v Speaker 4>do resent and ask the wage of the ged </v>
<v Speaker 4>ignored when they passed the human note </v>

2133
02:04:04.331 --> 02:04:07.970
<v Speaker 4>past with them what came after them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and 24 hours later,</v>

2134
02:04:07.971 --> 02:04:10.760
<v Speaker 4>it's still coming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is not men marching,</v>

2135
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:14.930
<v Speaker 4>but a force of nature like a tidal wave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an avalanche,</v>

2136
02:04:15.020 --> 02:04:17.900
<v Speaker 4>or a river flooding it's banks at this </v>
<v Speaker 4>minute.</v>

2137
02:04:17.900 --> 02:04:22.900
<v Speaker 4>It is rolling through Brussels as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>swollen waters of the valleys swept </v>

2138
02:04:22.900 --> 02:04:25.700
<v Speaker 4>through Johnstown at the site of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first few regiments of the enemy.</v>

2139
02:04:25.730 --> 02:04:28.280
<v Speaker 4>He writes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were thrilled with interest.</v>

2140
02:04:28.610 --> 02:04:33.610
<v Speaker 4>After three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had passed in one unbroken steel </v>

2141
02:04:33.610 --> 02:04:33.710
<v Speaker 4>gray column.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were bored,</v>

2142
02:04:34.070 --> 02:04:37.010
<v Speaker 4>but when hour after hour passed and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no,</v>

2143
02:04:37.710 --> 02:04:41.280
<v Speaker 4>no breathing time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no open spaces in the ranks.</v>

2144
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:44.310
<v Speaker 4>The thing became uncanny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>inhuman.</v>

2145
02:04:44.580 --> 02:04:46.740
<v Speaker 4>You returned to watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fascinated.</v>

2146
02:04:46.950 --> 02:04:51.950
<v Speaker 4>It held the mystery and menace of fog </v>
<v Speaker 4>rolling towards you across the sea and </v>

2147
02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:56.941
<v Speaker 4>quote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He then goes on to describe the </v>

2148
02:04:56.941 --> 02:04:57.210
<v Speaker 4>uniforms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are pretty much the same color.</v>

2149
02:04:57.211 --> 02:05:00.250
<v Speaker 4>The Second World War German uniforms are</v>
<v Speaker 4>felled Grau,</v>

2150
02:05:00.251 --> 02:05:01.950
<v Speaker 4>I guess is the proper way to pronounce </v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2151
02:05:01.951 --> 02:05:05.730
<v Speaker 4>but basically it's just a gray,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but during this time period,</v>

2152
02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:09.810
<v Speaker 4>most nations had only relatively </v>
<v Speaker 4>recently gone away from Gadi,</v>

2153
02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:11.700
<v Speaker 4>colorful clothing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2154
02:05:11.701 --> 02:05:16.701
<v Speaker 4>bright red scarlet for British troops </v>
<v Speaker 4>has only recently given away to khaki </v>

2155
02:05:16.701 --> 02:05:21.080
<v Speaker 4>and the French army still war stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 4>looked like they belong in Napoleon's </v>

2156
02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:21.080
<v Speaker 4>army,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2157
02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:25.520
<v Speaker 4>They're going to wear red pants and blue</v>
<v Speaker 4>jackets and they're going to carry </v>

2158
02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:30.441
<v Speaker 4>savers and their calvary is going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have breast plates and horse hair </v>

2159
02:05:30.441 --> 02:05:30.441
<v Speaker 4>helmets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2160
02:05:30.441 --> 02:05:33.801
<v Speaker 4>it's Kooky stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most militaries are moving away from </v>

2161
02:05:33.801 --> 02:05:36.591
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The German's use of gray harting thinks </v>

2162
02:05:36.591 --> 02:05:39.240
<v Speaker 4>is the most fantastic use of camouflage </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's ever seen.</v>

2163
02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:43.950
<v Speaker 4>The British Khaki is often compared to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>coronary that's gotten.</v>

2164
02:05:43.951 --> 02:05:48.951
<v Speaker 4>Dusty Davis goes on and on about how the</v>
<v Speaker 4>minute these German soldiers get 100 </v>

2165
02:05:49.861 --> 02:05:51.690
<v Speaker 4>yards from you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't see him anymore.</v>

2166
02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:56.780
<v Speaker 4>He says he was watching some German </v>
<v Speaker 4>cavalry would ride by and he could see </v>

2167
02:05:56.780 --> 02:05:59.841
<v Speaker 4>the horses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he couldn't see the guys on them </v>

2168
02:05:59.841 --> 02:06:01.671
<v Speaker 4>because they just sort of blend with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fog and the mist and the twilight and </v>

2169
02:06:01.671 --> 02:06:05.271
<v Speaker 4>the early morning hours in that color.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he goes on and on about how great </v>

2170
02:06:05.271 --> 02:06:08.040
<v Speaker 4>that is and how scientific it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes on quote yesterday,</v>

2171
02:06:08.041 --> 02:06:09.630
<v Speaker 4>Major Gen Vaughan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zeratsky,</v>

2172
02:06:09.631 --> 02:06:11.580
<v Speaker 4>the German military governor of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brussels,</v>

2173
02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:16.820
<v Speaker 4>assured burger master Max,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the German army would not occupy </v>

2174
02:06:16.820 --> 02:06:17.130
<v Speaker 4>the city but would pass through it.</v>

2175
02:06:17.490 --> 02:06:21.660
<v Speaker 4>It is still passing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have followed in campaigns six armies,</v>

2176
02:06:21.870 --> 02:06:25.410
<v Speaker 4>but accepting not even our own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Japanese or the British.</v>

2177
02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:27.870
<v Speaker 4>I have not seen one so thoroughly </v>
<v Speaker 4>equipped.</v>

2178
02:06:28.050 --> 02:06:30.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm not speaking of the fighting </v>
<v Speaker 4>qualities of any army,</v>

2179
02:06:30.750 --> 02:06:35.750
<v Speaker 4>only have the equipment in organization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The German army moved into this city as </v>

2180
02:06:35.750 --> 02:06:38.730
<v Speaker 4>smoothly and as compactly as the Empire </v>
<v Speaker 4>State Express,</v>

2181
02:06:38.910 --> 02:06:41.220
<v Speaker 4>there were no halts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no open places,</v>

2182
02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:43.710
<v Speaker 4>no stragglers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This army he writes,</v>

2183
02:06:43.890 --> 02:06:48.030
<v Speaker 4>has been on active service for three </v>
<v Speaker 4>weeks and so far there is not apparently</v>

2184
02:06:48.031 --> 02:06:53.031
<v Speaker 4>a chin strap or a horseshoe missing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It came in with the smoke pouring from </v>

2185
02:06:53.031 --> 02:06:57.681
<v Speaker 4>cookstoves on wheels and in an hour had </v>
<v Speaker 4>set up post office wagons from which </v>

2186
02:06:57.781 --> 02:07:02.130
<v Speaker 4>Mountain Messengers galloped along the </v>
<v Speaker 4>line of columns distributing letters and</v>

2187
02:07:02.131 --> 02:07:04.710
<v Speaker 4>at which soldiers posted picture </v>
<v Speaker 4>postcards.</v>

2188
02:07:04.890 --> 02:07:09.120
<v Speaker 4>The infantry he writes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>came in files of five to 100 men to each</v>

2189
02:07:09.121 --> 02:07:14.121
<v Speaker 4>company,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lancers in columns of four with not </v>

2190
02:07:14.121 --> 02:07:14.700
<v Speaker 4>a pendant missing the quick firing.</v>

2191
02:07:14.700 --> 02:07:18.690
<v Speaker 4>Guns and field pieces were one hour at a</v>
<v Speaker 4>time in passing each gun.</v>

2192
02:07:18.750 --> 02:07:23.280
<v Speaker 4>It's ammunition wagon taking 20 seconds </v>
<v Speaker 4>in which to pass the men of the infantry</v>

2193
02:07:23.281 --> 02:07:28.281
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>father land my father land between each </v>

2194
02:07:28.281 --> 02:07:28.830
<v Speaker 4>line of song.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They took three steps.</v>

2195
02:07:29.070 --> 02:07:33.630
<v Speaker 4>At times 2000 men were singing together </v>
<v Speaker 4>and absolute rhythm and beat.</v>

2196
02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:37.180
<v Speaker 4>When the melody gave way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the silence was broken only by the stamp</v>

2197
02:07:37.181 --> 02:07:40.570
<v Speaker 4>of iron shod boots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then again the song rose.</v>

2198
02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:43.660
<v Speaker 4>When the singing ceased,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bands played marches.</v>

2199
02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:46.210
<v Speaker 4>They were followed by the rumble of </v>
<v Speaker 4>siege guns,</v>

2200
02:07:46.330 --> 02:07:51.330
<v Speaker 4>the creaking of wheels and have chains </v>
<v Speaker 4>clanking against the cobblestones and </v>

2201
02:07:51.330 --> 02:07:54.160
<v Speaker 4>the sharp bell like voices of the Bugles</v>
<v Speaker 4>for seven hours.</v>

2202
02:07:54.161 --> 02:07:59.161
<v Speaker 4>The army passed in such solid columns </v>
<v Speaker 4>that not once might have taxi cab or </v>

2203
02:07:59.161 --> 02:08:01.780
<v Speaker 4>trolley car passed through the city like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a river of steel.</v>

2204
02:08:01.781 --> 02:08:05.770
<v Speaker 4>It flowed gray and ghostlike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then as dusk came in,</v>

2205
02:08:05.771 --> 02:08:10.771
<v Speaker 4>as thousands of horses hooves and </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands of iron boots continued to </v>

2206
02:08:10.771 --> 02:08:14.701
<v Speaker 4>tramp forward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they struck tiny sparks from the </v>

2207
02:08:14.701 --> 02:08:17.641
<v Speaker 4>cobblestones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the horses and men who beat out the </v>

2208
02:08:17.641 --> 02:08:17.710
<v Speaker 4>sparks were invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At midnight,</v>

2209
02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:20.410
<v Speaker 4>pack wagons and siege guns were still </v>
<v Speaker 4>passing.</v>

2210
02:08:20.620 --> 02:08:25.620
<v Speaker 4>At seven this morning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was awakened by the tramp of men in </v>

2211
02:08:25.620 --> 02:08:26.770
<v Speaker 4>bands playing jauntily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether they marched all night or not,</v>

2212
02:08:26.771 --> 02:08:29.650
<v Speaker 4>I do not know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now for 26 hours,</v>

2213
02:08:29.651 --> 02:08:34.651
<v Speaker 4>the gray army has rumbled by with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mystery of fog and the purchase of a </v>

2214
02:08:34.651 --> 02:08:35.290
<v Speaker 4>steam roller.</v>

2215
02:08:35.890 --> 02:08:39.550
<v Speaker 4>And to quote that was a long quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's.</v>

2216
02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:43.420
<v Speaker 4>That's the German army of the Kaiser,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right on campaign,</v>

2217
02:08:43.660 --> 02:08:48.660
<v Speaker 4>the German army and the Second World War</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that country's best attempt to </v>

2218
02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:53.060
<v Speaker 4>recreate that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2219
02:08:53.061 --> 02:08:58.061
<v Speaker 4>I've always believed that the very </v>
<v Speaker 4>ferocity in the scariness of this Kaiser</v>

2220
02:08:59.390 --> 02:09:04.390
<v Speaker 4>Rack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>German army worked against it at the </v>

2221
02:09:04.390 --> 02:09:07.450
<v Speaker 4>beginning of the war in a way that heard</v>
<v Speaker 4>it throughout the entire history of the </v>

2222
02:09:07.450 --> 02:09:11.240
<v Speaker 4>war and I think long afterwards helped </v>
<v Speaker 4>establish this German reputation as sort</v>

2223
02:09:11.241 --> 02:09:15.180
<v Speaker 4>of the bad guys because this army was so</v>
<v Speaker 4>intimidating,</v>

2224
02:09:15.181 --> 02:09:20.181
<v Speaker 4>so scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything from the precision drill to </v>

2225
02:09:20.181 --> 02:09:22.050
<v Speaker 4>the equipment to how well organized they</v>
<v Speaker 4>were to the logistics,</v>

2226
02:09:22.051 --> 02:09:27.051
<v Speaker 4>to the leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the intimidating elements built into </v>

2227
02:09:27.051 --> 02:09:30.231
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they had a wonderful a unit </v>

2228
02:09:30.231 --> 02:09:31.650
<v Speaker 4>called the death's head has SARS,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which goes back to,</v>

2229
02:09:31.970 --> 02:09:36.970
<v Speaker 4>you know the Napoleonic wars earlier </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually and they were the old fashioned</v>

2230
02:09:37.051 --> 02:09:39.780
<v Speaker 4>Hassan for helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is in 1914 folks.</v>

2231
02:09:39.781 --> 02:09:44.781
<v Speaker 4>This isn't an 18 tend the for helmet of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the CSRS and on the helmet is a skull.</v>

2232
02:09:46.820 --> 02:09:49.910
<v Speaker 4>Reminds you a little bit of the SS </v>
<v Speaker 4>forces in the Second World War,</v>

2233
02:09:49.911 --> 02:09:52.100
<v Speaker 4>but it shows you that all of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>predated.</v>

2234
02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:53.720
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the Nazis did.</v>

2235
02:09:53.721 --> 02:09:58.721
<v Speaker 4>The Nazi's were just updating a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>classic German traditions and in a lot </v>

2236
02:09:58.721 --> 02:09:59.780
<v Speaker 4>of cases perverting them and sustaining </v>
<v Speaker 4>them with blackness and everything,</v>

2237
02:09:59.990 --> 02:10:04.990
<v Speaker 4>but to deaths had his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ours are famous and intimidating as </v>

2238
02:10:04.990 --> 02:10:08.501
<v Speaker 4>they're meant to be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then you take that really nasty for </v>

2239
02:10:08.501 --> 02:10:11.911
<v Speaker 4>Roche's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intimidating army that looks like it </v>

2240
02:10:11.911 --> 02:10:14.341
<v Speaker 4>could take on anyone in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the first time you see him in action </v>

2241
02:10:14.341 --> 02:10:14.750
<v Speaker 4>they're taking on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God bless them.</v>

2242
02:10:15.230 --> 02:10:19.120
<v Speaker 4>The Belgians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a tiny little neutral nation that's less</v>

2243
02:10:19.121 --> 02:10:24.121
<v Speaker 4>than 100 years old and has never fought </v>
<v Speaker 4>a war in fact is so small and it's </v>

2244
02:10:24.371 --> 02:10:28.510
<v Speaker 4>surrounded by great powers that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>rationally figured out a long time ago.</v>

2245
02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:31.720
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter how much effort they </v>
<v Speaker 4>put into defense,</v>

2246
02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:33.760
<v Speaker 4>they can't win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2247
02:10:33.770 --> 02:10:38.770
<v Speaker 4>the Belgians totally unprepared for </v>
<v Speaker 4>warfare lose only a little bit faster </v>

2248
02:10:38.770 --> 02:10:41.090
<v Speaker 4>than the Belgians obsessively prepared </v>
<v Speaker 4>for warfare.</v>

2249
02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:47.960
<v Speaker 4>They put their trust in these </v>
<v Speaker 4>international agreements they had with </v>

2250
02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:47.960
<v Speaker 4>people who are going to guarantee their </v>
<v Speaker 4>security,</v>

2251
02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:49.200
<v Speaker 4>which is how this whole thing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening anyway.</v>

2252
02:10:49.230 --> 02:10:49.530
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2253
02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:55.680
<v Speaker 4>But they did build some defenses maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a sign that,</v>

2254
02:10:56.160 --> 02:10:57.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't kill you,</v>

2255
02:10:57.301 --> 02:11:02.301
<v Speaker 4>but we could hurt you and the defenses </v>
<v Speaker 4>are really cool because it's really </v>

2256
02:11:02.301 --> 02:11:05.310
<v Speaker 4>right in that period in human history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're fortifications,</v>

2257
02:11:05.311 --> 02:11:08.850
<v Speaker 4>forts reach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of their high watermark.</v>

2258
02:11:08.910 --> 02:11:12.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean we still build for today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's nothing like it was what pretty</v>

2259
02:11:12.541 --> 02:11:15.720
<v Speaker 4>much from the beginning of your human </v>
<v Speaker 4>history until.</v>

2260
02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:21.160
<v Speaker 4>Well about the time we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>here because then you could base an </v>

2261
02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:23.400
<v Speaker 4>entire defense strategy on Ford's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nowadays we have these special positions</v>

2262
02:11:23.401 --> 02:11:28.401
<v Speaker 4>where your guard them with a fort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if anybody decides they're going to </v>

2263
02:11:28.401 --> 02:11:28.401
<v Speaker 4>start launching missiles and bombs and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm.</v>

2264
02:11:28.401 --> 02:11:29.670
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter for us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't hold up.</v>

2265
02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:33.480
<v Speaker 4>That's something we learn very soon in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this story.</v>

2266
02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:36.240
<v Speaker 4>But in the 18 eighties when these </v>
<v Speaker 4>Belgian forts are built,</v>

2267
02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:41.870
<v Speaker 4>this is the period where it looks like </v>
<v Speaker 4>modern tech is going to make these </v>

2268
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:42.150
<v Speaker 4>things like space age.</v>

2269
02:11:42.180 --> 02:11:44.670
<v Speaker 4>That's something out of Star Wars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of those planetary defenses.</v>

2270
02:11:44.790 --> 02:11:48.330
<v Speaker 4>And they build these wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 4>subterranean forts.</v>

2271
02:11:48.331 --> 02:11:51.990
<v Speaker 4>Barbara Tuchman said like castles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sunk underground.</v>

2272
02:11:52.290 --> 02:11:53.430
<v Speaker 4>And what they'll do is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2273
02:11:53.431 --> 02:11:58.431
<v Speaker 4>I'm reminded of the old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Godzilla films and the monster zero </v>

2274
02:11:58.431 --> 02:12:00.840
<v Speaker 4>films where you'd have some planet and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it would have a gun that would just rise</v>

2275
02:12:00.841 --> 02:12:04.500
<v Speaker 4>up from the planet surface shoot and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then go back down under ground.</v>

2276
02:12:04.501 --> 02:12:06.420
<v Speaker 4>And that's what happened in these </v>
<v Speaker 4>boards.</v>

2277
02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:09.480
<v Speaker 4>And I have to remind myself how cool </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is.</v>

2278
02:12:09.481 --> 02:12:14.481
<v Speaker 4>This is like steam punk stuff because </v>
<v Speaker 4>when they're building these forts for </v>

2279
02:12:14.481 --> 02:12:18.231
<v Speaker 4>Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the same time that the United </v>

2280
02:12:18.231 --> 02:12:20.870
<v Speaker 4>States and Mexico are trying to corral </v>
<v Speaker 4>Geronimo and a bunch of Apaches in the </v>

2281
02:12:20.870 --> 02:12:21.690
<v Speaker 4>American southwest while that's going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

2282
02:12:21.870 --> 02:12:24.000
<v Speaker 4>The Belgians are building underground </v>
<v Speaker 4>forts.</v>

2283
02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:26.970
<v Speaker 4>And you can see some of the stuff on </v>
<v Speaker 4>video.</v>

2284
02:12:26.971 --> 02:12:31.971
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the Maginot line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which comes a generation after this </v>

2285
02:12:31.971 --> 02:12:31.971
<v Speaker 4>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's the same kind of thing where,</v>

2286
02:12:32.010 --> 02:12:33.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at it from above ground,</v>

2287
02:12:33.931 --> 02:12:37.320
<v Speaker 4>you can barely tell there's a fort there</v>
<v Speaker 4>when in fact underground,</v>

2288
02:12:37.321 --> 02:12:39.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>massive concrete and you know,</v>

2289
02:12:39.390 --> 02:12:42.420
<v Speaker 4>little railroads underneath moving guns </v>
<v Speaker 4>and ammunition around it.</v>

2290
02:12:42.460 --> 02:12:43.350
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's cool stuff.</v>

2291
02:12:43.351 --> 02:12:46.200
<v Speaker 4>And the way the Belgian designer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who was one of the best in the world,</v>

2292
02:12:46.530 --> 02:12:51.530
<v Speaker 4>built this system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he took advantage of the natural river </v>

2293
02:12:51.530 --> 02:12:51.630
<v Speaker 4>and the slight rise in the hill and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything in there.</v>

2294
02:12:51.631 --> 02:12:56.631
<v Speaker 4>And he built six big forts with six </v>
<v Speaker 4>small fortune in between and they all </v>

2295
02:12:56.631 --> 02:12:58.940
<v Speaker 4>cover each other's fields of fire with </v>
<v Speaker 4>their guns.</v>

2296
02:12:58.941 --> 02:13:02.460
<v Speaker 4>So you know what for a can reach with </v>
<v Speaker 4>their guns,</v>

2297
02:13:02.461 --> 02:13:03.990
<v Speaker 4>fort be can reach with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's two.</v>

2298
02:13:03.990 --> 02:13:06.930
<v Speaker 4>So they overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's never a place in the distance</v>

2299
02:13:06.931 --> 02:13:09.300
<v Speaker 4>anyway where the guns can't reach the </v>
<v Speaker 4>enemy.</v>

2300
02:13:09.840 --> 02:13:14.840
<v Speaker 4>And in between these sports,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Belgians have it so that they're </v>

2301
02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:16.380
<v Speaker 4>going to put guys in trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So between every Ford are people,</v>

2302
02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:18.750
<v Speaker 4>they're supported by the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this wonderful system.</v>

2303
02:13:18.751 --> 02:13:21.240
<v Speaker 4>And then you throw more troops out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2304
02:13:21.241 --> 02:13:26.241
<v Speaker 4>500 yards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 yards ahead to keep enemy artillery </v>

2305
02:13:26.241 --> 02:13:27.660
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you have this system where maybe you</v>

2306
02:13:27.661 --> 02:13:30.000
<v Speaker 4>can't win a war against someone like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Germans,</v>

2307
02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:32.940
<v Speaker 4>which you give them a bloody nose and </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe say,</v>

2308
02:13:32.941 --> 02:13:34.530
<v Speaker 4>see you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really don't want to do this.</v>

2309
02:13:34.590 --> 02:13:37.050
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Germans aren't sure about that.</v>

2310
02:13:37.051 --> 02:13:42.051
<v Speaker 4>And when they come into Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're kind of thinking the Belgian </v>

2311
02:13:42.051 --> 02:13:42.660
<v Speaker 4>armies either just going to stand aside,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said earlier,</v>

2312
02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:45.150
<v Speaker 4>or maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>few shots up in the air.</v>

2313
02:13:45.151 --> 02:13:46.110
<v Speaker 4>We protected our honor.</v>

2314
02:13:46.110 --> 02:13:51.110
<v Speaker 4>Now we're going to stand aside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the first sign that the Germans are </v>

2315
02:13:51.110 --> 02:13:52.230
<v Speaker 4>wrong about this is that the bridges are</v>
<v Speaker 4>blown up when they get to them,</v>

2316
02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:57.680
<v Speaker 4>the tunnels are blown up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the railroads are blown up that Madden's</v>

2317
02:13:58.831 --> 02:14:01.140
<v Speaker 4>the Germans because they're on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>tight schedule,</v>

2318
02:14:01.141 --> 02:14:06.141
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now they have to deal with at least </v>

2319
02:14:06.141 --> 02:14:09.921
<v Speaker 4>transportation nightmares on this road </v>
<v Speaker 4>system that was already going to be </v>

2320
02:14:09.921 --> 02:14:10.680
<v Speaker 4>clogged terribly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's your first nightmare.</v>

2321
02:14:10.681 --> 02:14:15.681
<v Speaker 4>And then the Germans tried to cross some</v>
<v Speaker 4>of these rivers on the frontier in </v>

2322
02:14:15.681 --> 02:14:16.080
<v Speaker 4>pontoons and the Belgian start shooting </v>
<v Speaker 4>at them.</v>

2323
02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:22.640
<v Speaker 4>So the Germans put into action a group </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they have designed specifically to </v>

2324
02:14:23.611 --> 02:14:25.350
<v Speaker 4>take these forts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is the part of the story.</v>

2325
02:14:25.351 --> 02:14:27.540
<v Speaker 4>You have to understand where we are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When war was declared,</v>

2326
02:14:27.541 --> 02:14:32.541
<v Speaker 4>you have like 72 hours where everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to get their heads around this </v>

2327
02:14:32.541 --> 02:14:32.541
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>

2328
02:14:32.541 --> 02:14:34.920
<v Speaker 4>And at the same time they flipped all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these switches for mobilization.</v>

2329
02:14:34.921 --> 02:14:39.921
<v Speaker 4>The doomsday device I called it where </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're calling up all these forces and </v>

2330
02:14:39.921 --> 02:14:39.921
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2331
02:14:39.921 --> 02:14:43.671
<v Speaker 4>we don't have enough stuff here and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's scrambling in what they </v>

2332
02:14:43.671 --> 02:14:45.120
<v Speaker 4>assume is a race to the front lines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they don't want to lose.</v>

2333
02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:48.960
<v Speaker 4>Remember what if they gave a warrant?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only one side came.</v>

2334
02:14:49.890 --> 02:14:52.620
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>while everybody is concentrating,</v>

2335
02:14:52.621 --> 02:14:55.530
<v Speaker 4>it's called their forces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Germans have like 30,000</v>

2336
02:14:55.531 --> 02:15:00.531
<v Speaker 4>guys that were set up in advance to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>out basically in the pregame of the </v>

2337
02:15:00.531 --> 02:15:03.240
<v Speaker 4>first World War,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess you could say and take out these</v>

2338
02:15:03.241 --> 02:15:06.480
<v Speaker 4>forts if they have to because these </v>
<v Speaker 4>forts are blocking the roads.</v>

2339
02:15:06.810 --> 02:15:10.380
<v Speaker 4>You cannot get to that Belgian road </v>
<v Speaker 4>system that you need to get from Germany</v>

2340
02:15:10.381 --> 02:15:15.381
<v Speaker 4>to France if you don't take the forts </v>
<v Speaker 4>around a place like leanne or named </v>

2341
02:15:15.381 --> 02:15:15.381
<v Speaker 4>Laura.</v>

2342
02:15:15.780 --> 02:15:18.600
<v Speaker 4>And so 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>men had been training for years for just</v>

2343
02:15:18.601 --> 02:15:19.800
<v Speaker 4>this job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I said earlier,</v>

2344
02:15:19.801 --> 02:15:24.801
<v Speaker 4>the day was called der Tog the day this </v>
<v Speaker 4>has been planned for for a long time.</v>

2345
02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:28.380
<v Speaker 4>And the Germans have essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 4>special unit of 30,000</v>

2346
02:15:28.381 --> 02:15:30.390
<v Speaker 4>guys whose job it is to take out these </v>
<v Speaker 4>sports.</v>

2347
02:15:30.391 --> 02:15:32.490
<v Speaker 4>If the Belgians don't stand aside and </v>
<v Speaker 4>surrender them,</v>

2348
02:15:32.820 --> 02:15:34.820
<v Speaker 4>the Belgians don't stand aside and </v>
<v Speaker 4>surrender them.</v>

2349
02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:41.240
<v Speaker 4>And in fact the Belgians are going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>teach the first great lesson of the war,</v>

2350
02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:47.340
<v Speaker 4>about what's changed since the last </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2351
02:15:47.341 --> 02:15:52.341
<v Speaker 4>Great powers faced off how much the </v>
<v Speaker 4>killing power that machine's afforded </v>

2352
02:15:54.031 --> 02:15:59.031
<v Speaker 4>mankind on the battlefield.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much that had changed the age old </v>

2353
02:15:59.031 --> 02:16:01.290
<v Speaker 4>equation of war machines had been taken </v>
<v Speaker 4>over for a long time,</v>

2354
02:16:01.291 --> 02:16:06.291
<v Speaker 4>becoming more and more important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the war where they take over </v>

2355
02:16:06.291 --> 02:16:10.560
<v Speaker 4>completely and man supremacy on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>battlefield,</v>

2356
02:16:10.650 --> 02:16:12.750
<v Speaker 4>even though they're the ones who run the</v>
<v Speaker 4>machines,</v>

2357
02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:18.440
<v Speaker 4>will always be now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>secondary compared to the killing power </v>

2358
02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:22.860
<v Speaker 4>and mechanization that can be brought to</v>
<v Speaker 4>bear by modern societies.</v>

2359
02:16:23.190 --> 02:16:28.190
<v Speaker 4>The technology was devastating when used</v>
<v Speaker 4>against tribal peoples and nations that </v>

2360
02:16:29.111 --> 02:16:34.111
<v Speaker 4>couldn't compete militarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Belgians are going to show what a </v>

2361
02:16:34.111 --> 02:16:35.620
<v Speaker 4>tiny little army of chocolate soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

2362
02:16:35.621 --> 02:16:37.540
<v Speaker 4>What the Germans thought they were going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to face.</v>

2363
02:16:37.690 --> 02:16:42.690
<v Speaker 4>What a tiny little army of chocolate </v>
<v Speaker 4>soldiers can do to the greatest army in </v>

2364
02:16:42.690 --> 02:16:43.180
<v Speaker 4>the world because of the</v>

2365
02:16:44.480 --> 02:16:46.400
<v Speaker 4>deadliness of the weapons at hand,</v>

2366
02:16:47.820 --> 02:16:52.820
<v Speaker 4>and one of the interesting sort of sub </v>
<v Speaker 4>themes of this whole upcoming conflict </v>

2367
02:16:52.820 --> 02:16:56.930
<v Speaker 4>is how long it takes some people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>absorb the lessons that are being taught</v>

2368
02:16:58.021 --> 02:16:59.560
<v Speaker 4>in this conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2369
02:16:59.790 --> 02:17:04.790
<v Speaker 4>lesson number one is how deadly the </v>
<v Speaker 4>weapons are and how you have to account </v>

2370
02:17:04.790 --> 02:17:08.181
<v Speaker 4>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of the generals and military </v>

2371
02:17:08.181 --> 02:17:10.371
<v Speaker 4>thinkers understood this going into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>war because they had paid close </v>

2372
02:17:10.371 --> 02:17:10.371
<v Speaker 4>attention to that 19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2373
02:17:10.371 --> 02:17:12.120
<v Speaker 4>five war I told you about the Russo </v>
<v Speaker 4>Japanese war,</v>

2374
02:17:12.420 --> 02:17:15.720
<v Speaker 4>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>American President Teddy Roosevelt won a</v>

2375
02:17:15.721 --> 02:17:18.600
<v Speaker 4>Nobel prize for helping to broker the </v>
<v Speaker 4>piece for that.</v>

2376
02:17:19.230 --> 02:17:24.230
<v Speaker 4>But that taught lessons about what </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens when two sides armed with </v>

2377
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:26.820
<v Speaker 4>machine guns and two sides armed with </v>
<v Speaker 4>modern artillery and all that face off.</v>

2378
02:17:27.420 --> 02:17:30.750
<v Speaker 4>But the lessons were not the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>lesson some people wanted to learn.</v>

2379
02:17:30.751 --> 02:17:33.000
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were a cavalry commander,</v>

2380
02:17:33.001 --> 02:17:38.001
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your arm of the military is already not </v>

2381
02:17:38.001 --> 02:17:38.760
<v Speaker 4>looked upon as very survivable.</v>

2382
02:17:39.060 --> 02:17:44.060
<v Speaker 4>The war is all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>since Napoleon have kind of shown that </v>

2383
02:17:44.060 --> 02:17:44.340
<v Speaker 4>listened cavalry just dies on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>battlefield.</v>

2384
02:17:44.760 --> 02:17:47.640
<v Speaker 4>The only thing that cavalry commander </v>
<v Speaker 4>still have going in their favor is there</v>

2385
02:17:47.641 --> 02:17:50.970
<v Speaker 4>aren't really automobiles yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There will be by the time this was over,</v>

2386
02:17:51.210 --> 02:17:53.730
<v Speaker 4>but they're a novelty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There'll be used in strange,</v>

2387
02:17:53.731 --> 02:17:58.731
<v Speaker 4>innovative situations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but militaries of the world don't have </v>

2388
02:17:58.731 --> 02:17:58.731
<v Speaker 4>tons of automobiles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2389
02:17:58.731 --> 02:18:02.901
<v Speaker 4>running.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not mechanized like the Second </v>

2390
02:18:02.901 --> 02:18:02.901
<v Speaker 4>World War.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's using horses.</v>

2391
02:18:02.901 --> 02:18:04.710
<v Speaker 4>Even if they die on the battlefield,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2392
02:18:04.711 --> 02:18:09.711
<v Speaker 4>like sheaves of wheat being sized down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have nothing to replace that </v>

2393
02:18:09.711 --> 02:18:13.281
<v Speaker 4>mobility with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But these cavalry commanders don't want </v>

2394
02:18:13.281 --> 02:18:13.281
<v Speaker 4>to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's even worse than it used to be.</v>

2395
02:18:13.281 --> 02:18:17.480
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait until the modern artillery machine </v>

2396
02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:17.480
<v Speaker 4>guns get ahold of your cavalry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to hear that.</v>

2397
02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:21.891
<v Speaker 4>So they talk about the results as being </v>
<v Speaker 4>unrepresentative commanders who were </v>

2398
02:18:21.891 --> 02:18:21.891
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2399
02:18:22.700 --> 02:18:24.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>involved in the idea of the power of the</v>

2400
02:18:24.681 --> 02:18:26.360
<v Speaker 4>bayonet and the charge and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>offensive.</v>

2401
02:18:26.630 --> 02:18:31.630
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire French outlook on war right </v>

2402
02:18:31.630 --> 02:18:34.271
<v Speaker 4>now is connected to this idea that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>attack and you know you attack with the </v>

2403
02:18:34.271 --> 02:18:35.450
<v Speaker 4>band.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't really mean you're gonna,</v>

2404
02:18:35.810 --> 02:18:40.810
<v Speaker 4>maybe get into hand to hand combat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that aggressive style of warfare is </v>

2405
02:18:40.810 --> 02:18:41.300
<v Speaker 4>what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you've been preaching that and that's</v>

2406
02:18:41.301 --> 02:18:44.300
<v Speaker 4>your country's doctrine and your entire </v>
<v Speaker 4>military is organized around the culture</v>

2407
02:18:44.301 --> 02:18:47.420
<v Speaker 4>of the offensive and Cran,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the French word,</v>

2408
02:18:47.421 --> 02:18:50.090
<v Speaker 4>I guess for like guts and it's all about</v>
<v Speaker 4>guts.</v>

2409
02:18:50.270 --> 02:18:52.850
<v Speaker 4>Nobody wants to hear that machine guns </v>
<v Speaker 4>just rip the guts out.</v>

2410
02:18:52.880 --> 02:18:57.880
<v Speaker 4>That's the only thing they care about </v>
<v Speaker 4>guts and it doesn't work to have bang a </v>

2411
02:18:57.880 --> 02:18:58.940
<v Speaker 4>net charges and ridiculous offensives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2412
02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:00.590
<v Speaker 4>the French would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

2413
02:19:00.591 --> 02:19:05.591
<v Speaker 4>well what doesn't work for the Russians </v>
<v Speaker 4>or the Japanese will work for the </v>

2414
02:19:05.591 --> 02:19:06.350
<v Speaker 4>French,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's why we have a great military.</v>

2415
02:19:06.350 --> 02:19:08.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's all kinds of ways to rationalize</v>

2416
02:19:08.301 --> 02:19:13.301
<v Speaker 4>what you don't want to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Many of the militaries of the world are </v>

2417
02:19:13.301 --> 02:19:16.670
<v Speaker 4>organized like Napoleonic Times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to hear that.</v>

2418
02:19:16.671 --> 02:19:19.040
<v Speaker 4>That is a completely wrong way to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>organized.</v>

2419
02:19:19.041 --> 02:19:23.600
<v Speaker 4>The French cavalry heading off to war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I said earlier,</v>

2420
02:19:23.601 --> 02:19:28.601
<v Speaker 4>but you have to imagine this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to see what Nepalian </v>

2421
02:19:28.601 --> 02:19:32.100
<v Speaker 4>soldiers looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go look at pictures of the French </v>

2422
02:19:32.100 --> 02:19:34.691
<v Speaker 4>cavalry in 1914 going off to war with </v>
<v Speaker 4>metal breastplates and horse hair </v>

2423
02:19:35.211 --> 02:19:40.211
<v Speaker 4>helmets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you would have to be an expert to </v>

2424
02:19:40.211 --> 02:19:42.470
<v Speaker 4>look at a picture of them in 1914 and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>picture of Napoleon's cavalry in 18,</v>

2425
02:19:42.471 --> 02:19:47.471
<v Speaker 4>14 and find the differences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The officers are going to go to war and </v>

2426
02:19:47.761 --> 02:19:50.070
<v Speaker 4>white gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're gonna have swords,</v>

2427
02:19:50.190 --> 02:19:55.190
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stand up and troops are going to march </v>

2428
02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:58.011
<v Speaker 4>into combat in like billiard ball </v>
<v Speaker 4>formations or you know,</v>

2429
02:19:58.380 --> 02:20:01.770
<v Speaker 4>bowling pin formations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drill formations from the battlefield.</v>

2430
02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:06.060
<v Speaker 4>None of the people who consider this to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be an integral part of military culture.</v>

2431
02:20:06.061 --> 02:20:08.370
<v Speaker 4>Want to learn that the rules have </v>
<v Speaker 4>changed.</v>

2432
02:20:08.850 --> 02:20:11.820
<v Speaker 4>In 1905.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got one lesson in 1914.</v>

2433
02:20:11.821 --> 02:20:16.821
<v Speaker 4>They were about to get another and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germans get there is when they try to </v>

2434
02:20:16.821 --> 02:20:16.821
<v Speaker 4>take these forts</v>

2435
02:20:16.821 --> 02:20:17.110
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>August fifth,</v>

2436
02:20:17.111 --> 02:20:18.400
<v Speaker 4>19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>14,</v>

2437
02:20:19.090 --> 02:20:24.090
<v Speaker 4>the Germans attack four of these Belgian</v>
<v Speaker 4>fourths now between the forts,</v>

2438
02:20:26.070 --> 02:20:31.070
<v Speaker 4>the Belgians and quickly put them </v>
<v Speaker 4>infantry and there were a couple of </v>

2439
02:20:31.070 --> 02:20:31.070
<v Speaker 4>machine guns around and whatnot and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germans,</v>

2440
02:20:31.070 --> 02:20:32.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're in a bit of a rush here.</v>

2441
02:20:32.421 --> 02:20:34.310
<v Speaker 4>They don't have time to sit there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>starve things out.</v>

2442
02:20:34.311 --> 02:20:39.311
<v Speaker 4>This 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>man force with artillery has to go in </v>

2443
02:20:39.311 --> 02:20:40.570
<v Speaker 4>there and power this through so that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>armies behind them can continue there.</v>

2444
02:20:40.790 --> 02:20:45.320
<v Speaker 4>If you just solve through Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>France and they charge these,</v>

2445
02:20:45.620 --> 02:20:49.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>entrenchments and the Belgian slaughter,</v>

2446
02:20:49.181 --> 02:20:51.790
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>slaughter them,</v>

2447
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:59.070
<v Speaker 4>mounds of bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the Belgians can't figure out the </v>

2448
02:20:59.070 --> 02:21:03.391
<v Speaker 4>best way to deal with it because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mounds of bodies become a problem </v>

2449
02:21:03.391 --> 02:21:06.250
<v Speaker 4>because the mountains of bodies become </v>
<v Speaker 4>places German troops can hide behind and</v>

2450
02:21:06.251 --> 02:21:11.251
<v Speaker 4>shoot from behind and launch attacks </v>
<v Speaker 4>from behind and the Belgians are trying </v>

2451
02:21:11.251 --> 02:21:11.251
<v Speaker 4>to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2452
02:21:11.251 --> 02:21:12.730
<v Speaker 4>do we shoot through these bodies and </v>
<v Speaker 4>create.</v>

2453
02:21:12.731 --> 02:21:14.890
<v Speaker 4>Can you create.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you create a whole through bodies if</v>

2454
02:21:14.891 --> 02:21:16.450
<v Speaker 4>you shoot through them with a machine </v>
<v Speaker 4>gun long enough,</v>

2455
02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:20.140
<v Speaker 4>or do we send out people to risk their </v>
<v Speaker 4>lives to create holes in the bodies that</v>

2456
02:21:20.141 --> 02:21:25.141
<v Speaker 4>we can shoot through?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Barbara Tuchman has a passage in her </v>

2457
02:21:25.141 --> 02:21:29.461
<v Speaker 4>book where she quotes the commander of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Belgian forces that were resisting </v>

2458
02:21:29.461 --> 02:21:34.291
<v Speaker 4>this German assault by Gen Vaughan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>emic and his Special Brigades Tuckman </v>

2459
02:21:34.291 --> 02:21:34.810
<v Speaker 4>writes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote</v>

2460
02:21:36.300 --> 02:21:41.100
<v Speaker 4>on August Fifth Mx Brigades open to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>attack on the four eastern most forcibly</v>

2461
02:21:41.101 --> 02:21:43.770
<v Speaker 4>edge with a cannonade by field </v>
<v Speaker 4>artillery,</v>

2462
02:21:43.950 --> 02:21:48.950
<v Speaker 4>followed by an infantry assault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The light shells made no impression on </v>

2463
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:52.821
<v Speaker 4>the fords,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the Belgian guns poured a hail of </v>

2464
02:21:52.821 --> 02:21:53.880
<v Speaker 4>fire on the German troops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Slaughtering their front ranks.</v>

2465
02:21:54.150 --> 02:21:57.900
<v Speaker 4>Company after company came on making for</v>
<v Speaker 4>the spaces in between.</v>

2466
02:21:57.901 --> 02:22:00.900
<v Speaker 4>The forks were the Belgian entrenchments</v>
<v Speaker 4>had not been completed.</v>

2467
02:22:01.290 --> 02:22:03.840
<v Speaker 4>At some points where they broke through </v>
<v Speaker 4>the German,</v>

2468
02:22:03.841 --> 02:22:08.841
<v Speaker 4>stormed up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the slopes were the guns could not be </v>

2469
02:22:08.841 --> 02:22:10.170
<v Speaker 4>depressed to reach them and were mowed </v>
<v Speaker 4>down by machine guns.</v>

2470
02:22:10.500 --> 02:22:14.370
<v Speaker 4>The dead piled up enriches a yard high </v>
<v Speaker 4>at fort boss,</v>

2471
02:22:14.371 --> 02:22:19.371
<v Speaker 4>shown Belgians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing the German lines waiver charged </v>

2472
02:22:19.371 --> 02:22:21.180
<v Speaker 4>with the bayonet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And threw them back again and again.</v>

2473
02:22:21.181 --> 02:22:25.470
<v Speaker 4>The Germans returned to the assault </v>
<v Speaker 4>spending lives like bullets in knowledge</v>

2474
02:22:25.471 --> 02:22:27.810
<v Speaker 4>of plentiful reserves to make up for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>losses.</v>

2475
02:22:28.230 --> 02:22:31.680
<v Speaker 4>She now quotes a Belgian officer who was</v>
<v Speaker 4>their quote.</v>

2476
02:22:32.100 --> 02:22:36.270
<v Speaker 4>They made no attempt at deploying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A Belgian officer described it later,</v>

2477
02:22:36.660 --> 02:22:41.660
<v Speaker 4>but came on line after line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost shoulder to shoulder until we </v>

2478
02:22:41.660 --> 02:22:45.351
<v Speaker 4>shot them down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fallen were heaped on top of each </v>

2479
02:22:45.351 --> 02:22:48.180
<v Speaker 4>other and unlawful barricade of dead and</v>
<v Speaker 4>wounded that threatened to mask our guns</v>

2480
02:22:48.270 --> 02:22:53.270
<v Speaker 4>and causes trouble so high to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>barricade become the we didn't know </v>

2481
02:22:53.270 --> 02:22:56.160
<v Speaker 4>whether to fire through it or to go out </v>
<v Speaker 4>and clear openings with our hands,</v>

2482
02:22:56.370 --> 02:23:01.370
<v Speaker 4>but would you believe it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This veritable wall of dead and dying </v>

2483
02:23:01.370 --> 02:23:04.821
<v Speaker 4>enabled those wonderful Germans to creep</v>
<v Speaker 4>closer and actually charge up the </v>

2484
02:23:04.821 --> 02:23:09.591
<v Speaker 4>embankment?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got no farther than halfway though </v>

2485
02:23:09.591 --> 02:23:09.930
<v Speaker 4>because our machine guns and rifles </v>
<v Speaker 4>swept them back.</v>

2486
02:23:10.230 --> 02:23:15.230
<v Speaker 4>Of course we had our losses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were slight compared to the </v>

2487
02:23:15.230 --> 02:23:16.740
<v Speaker 4>current age we inflicted on our enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to quote,</v>

2488
02:23:18.670 --> 02:23:23.670
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting to note,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't it that Belgian officers respect </v>

2489
02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:24.850
<v Speaker 4>for those wonderful Germans as he called</v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

2490
02:23:25.690 --> 02:23:30.690
<v Speaker 4>exhibiting the military virtues of valor</v>
<v Speaker 4>that were so celebrated during this </v>

2491
02:23:31.121 --> 02:23:36.121
<v Speaker 4>period where the romance of warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which had always been strong in human </v>

2492
02:23:36.121 --> 02:23:37.330
<v Speaker 4>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was probably at its height,</v>

2493
02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:42.460
<v Speaker 4>the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The romance was incredible.</v>

2494
02:23:43.550 --> 02:23:48.550
<v Speaker 4>This is the era where that romance runs </v>
<v Speaker 4>into reality in a way that you just </v>

2495
02:23:48.550 --> 02:23:52.361
<v Speaker 4>can't pretend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean guys like you know William </v>

2496
02:23:52.361 --> 02:23:55.780
<v Speaker 4>Tecumseh Sherman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the civil war general for the US </v>

2497
02:23:55.780 --> 02:23:55.910
<v Speaker 4>famously said that war is hell and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>glory is all Moonshine,</v>

2498
02:23:56.330 --> 02:24:01.330
<v Speaker 4>but that didn't really see into the mass</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the population is one historian had </v>

2499
02:24:01.330 --> 02:24:04.931
<v Speaker 4>pointed out they weren't publishing a </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole lot of combat photos and really </v>

2500
02:24:04.931 --> 02:24:09.161
<v Speaker 4>nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible stuff for the folks back home </v>

2501
02:24:09.161 --> 02:24:10.880
<v Speaker 4>at any time during these periods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there wasn't a lot of stuff to really</v>

2502
02:24:11.240 --> 02:24:16.240
<v Speaker 4>counteract the romantic ideas of war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the conflict where you can't </v>

2503
02:24:17.211 --> 02:24:22.211
<v Speaker 4>hide it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even though this Belgian officer </v>

2504
02:24:22.211 --> 02:24:23.320
<v Speaker 4>looks at this German assault on his </v>
<v Speaker 4>photos,</v>

2505
02:24:23.350 --> 02:24:26.210
<v Speaker 4>something akin to the charge of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>light brigade,</v>

2506
02:24:26.211 --> 02:24:31.130
<v Speaker 4>the famous doomed charge of that British</v>
<v Speaker 4>cavalry during the Crimean war.</v>

2507
02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:33.620
<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing that this war is </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to teach.</v>

2508
02:24:33.890 --> 02:24:38.890
<v Speaker 4>If you watch the charge of the light </v>
<v Speaker 4>brigade and you think it's magnificent </v>

2509
02:24:38.890 --> 02:24:42.410
<v Speaker 4>and brave,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a doomed sort of attack on the part of </v>

2510
02:24:42.410 --> 02:24:45.820
<v Speaker 4>incredibly courageous men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens if after the charge fails,</v>

2511
02:24:46.490 --> 02:24:49.820
<v Speaker 4>they send another one and the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>results occur and then they send another</v>

2512
02:24:49.821 --> 02:24:52.310
<v Speaker 4>one in the same results occur and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they do it again.</v>

2513
02:24:52.311 --> 02:24:54.920
<v Speaker 4>And again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At what point does this wonderful,</v>

2514
02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:56.720
<v Speaker 4>doomed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>romantic,</v>

2515
02:24:56.930 --> 02:25:01.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>celebration of the courage of the </v>

2516
02:25:01.930 --> 02:25:02.360
<v Speaker 4>military heart become something obscene.</v>

2517
02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:09.040
<v Speaker 4>This war is going to take us there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to pound the point home until</v>

2518
02:25:09.201 --> 02:25:10.130
<v Speaker 4>you're sick of it.</v>

2519
02:25:11.840 --> 02:25:14.720
<v Speaker 4>After the failure of that German attack </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the Belgian defenses,</v>

2520
02:25:14.990 --> 02:25:17.930
<v Speaker 4>the Germans regroup to attack again that</v>
<v Speaker 4>same night,</v>

2521
02:25:17.960 --> 02:25:20.660
<v Speaker 4>August fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're waiting for the sun to go down.</v>

2522
02:25:21.290 --> 02:25:26.290
<v Speaker 4>And witnesses who were with the troops </v>
<v Speaker 4>described them as nervous and anxious </v>

2523
02:25:27.281 --> 02:25:31.240
<v Speaker 4>and gloomy about the prospects of </v>
<v Speaker 4>assaulting you know these defenses.</v>

2524
02:25:31.241 --> 02:25:34.690
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's more doing it at night throughout</v>

2525
02:25:34.691 --> 02:25:36.460
<v Speaker 4>most of human history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>night assaults,</v>

2526
02:25:36.670 --> 02:25:40.210
<v Speaker 4>if you were lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had torchlight illumination.</v>

2527
02:25:40.211 --> 02:25:42.850
<v Speaker 4>It was always a huge gamble,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very disorienting.</v>

2528
02:25:42.851 --> 02:25:47.530
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't see anything that was going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to change with this war and it was going</v>

2529
02:25:47.531 --> 02:25:51.670
<v Speaker 4>to be a facet of 20th century warfare </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we may never see repeated again.</v>

2530
02:25:51.671 --> 02:25:54.070
<v Speaker 4>Now that night vision has become a </v>
<v Speaker 4>battlefield staple.</v>

2531
02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:56.740
<v Speaker 4>There is no reason to light up the </v>
<v Speaker 4>battlefield.</v>

2532
02:25:56.980 --> 02:26:01.980
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if one side has night vision and the </v>

2533
02:26:01.980 --> 02:26:01.980
<v Speaker 4>other doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want it lit up.</v>

2534
02:26:01.980 --> 02:26:05.520
<v Speaker 4>In this period,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these Germans were going to go into </v>

2535
02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:07.630
<v Speaker 4>conflict where the nighttime darkness </v>
<v Speaker 4>could be banished by technology.</v>

2536
02:26:08.380 --> 02:26:13.380
<v Speaker 4>You had search lights in these forts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knew had search lights on the German </v>

2537
02:26:13.380 --> 02:26:16.411
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you had shells that you could </v>

2538
02:26:16.411 --> 02:26:17.380
<v Speaker 4>shoot up into the air that would </v>
<v Speaker 4>illuminate the night sky and you have to</v>

2539
02:26:17.381 --> 02:26:19.510
<v Speaker 4>imagine bunches of those shells going </v>
<v Speaker 4>off,</v>

2540
02:26:19.770 --> 02:26:21.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at separate intervals where they overlap</v>

2541
02:26:21.971 --> 02:26:23.470
<v Speaker 4>and so they're getting brighter and </v>
<v Speaker 4>darker.</v>

2542
02:26:23.471 --> 02:26:24.110
<v Speaker 4>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2543
02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:27.550
<v Speaker 4>the look of it reminds you of like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>flash bulb flash,</v>

2544
02:26:27.551 --> 02:26:30.520
<v Speaker 4>that sort of strobe light,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fluorescent lumination,</v>

2545
02:26:30.940 --> 02:26:35.680
<v Speaker 4>and it just casts a ghostly Paul over </v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole battlefield so that every time</v>

2546
02:26:35.681 --> 02:26:40.681
<v Speaker 4>you get that burst of light,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see thousands of people like ants </v>

2547
02:26:40.681 --> 02:26:42.070
<v Speaker 4>moving along the battlefield and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have artillery going off.</v>

2548
02:26:42.071 --> 02:26:47.071
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just think about how weird and </v>

2549
02:26:47.071 --> 02:26:49.291
<v Speaker 4>disorienting being in the middle of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>modern battlefield would be in the </v>

2550
02:26:49.291 --> 02:26:49.291
<v Speaker 4>daytime.</v>

2551
02:26:49.291 --> 02:26:53.240
<v Speaker 4>And now take away the light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's freaky and that's what these German</v>

2552
02:26:53.290 --> 02:26:56.560
<v Speaker 4>soldiers are about to face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're understandably nervous.</v>

2553
02:26:56.561 --> 02:26:59.410
<v Speaker 4>They expected some sort of romantic kind</v>
<v Speaker 4>of war.</v>

2554
02:26:59.411 --> 02:27:04.411
<v Speaker 4>Even if it was dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had a chance for heroism and a </v>

2555
02:27:04.411 --> 02:27:07.291
<v Speaker 4>chance to die for your country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is a generation that is </v>

2556
02:27:07.291 --> 02:27:10.890
<v Speaker 4>absolutely infused with the ideas of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nationalism and that dying for your </v>

2557
02:27:10.890 --> 02:27:14.911
<v Speaker 4>country is a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>glorious thing that you should look </v>

2558
02:27:14.911 --> 02:27:14.911
<v Speaker 4>forward to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And now they're seeing,</v>

2559
02:27:14.911 --> 02:27:19.561
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how glorious is it to be one of many </v>

2560
02:27:19.561 --> 02:27:20.050
<v Speaker 4>people mowed down by machine guns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2561
02:27:20.051 --> 02:27:25.051
<v Speaker 4>just sort of randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't want to go on the assault </v>

2562
02:27:25.051 --> 02:27:28.030
<v Speaker 4>again and this attack starts to bog down</v>
<v Speaker 4>after it starts.</v>

2563
02:27:29.110 --> 02:27:34.110
<v Speaker 4>Now there's an officer who's roaming </v>
<v Speaker 4>around the battlefield who normally is </v>

2564
02:27:34.421 --> 02:27:37.960
<v Speaker 4>in Berlin with the high general staff of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the German military.</v>

2565
02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:43.320
<v Speaker 4>The Germans encourage their staff </v>
<v Speaker 4>members to get out in the field </v>

2566
02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:46.621
<v Speaker 4>sometimes and see what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this guy had a particular interest </v>

2567
02:27:46.621 --> 02:27:48.820
<v Speaker 4>in this battle because he was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who planned it for years.</v>

2568
02:27:48.821 --> 02:27:53.821
<v Speaker 4>He'd been planning this battle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He took his vacations from Germany to </v>

2569
02:27:53.821 --> 02:27:55.150
<v Speaker 4>Belgium just to look around where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>battle was going to be fought,</v>

2570
02:27:55.480 --> 02:28:00.480
<v Speaker 4>and now since he had a vested interest </v>
<v Speaker 4>in hoping his plans were carried out </v>

2571
02:28:00.480 --> 02:28:04.351
<v Speaker 4>correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's wandering around this battlefield </v>

2572
02:28:04.351 --> 02:28:06.721
<v Speaker 4>at night looking for what the holdup is </v>
<v Speaker 4>and finds out that the general </v>

2573
02:28:06.721 --> 02:28:08.680
<v Speaker 4>commanding a certain part of the attack </v>
<v Speaker 4>is dead killed by machine gun fire.</v>

2574
02:28:08.830 --> 02:28:13.830
<v Speaker 4>So this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this staff officer who historians have </v>

2575
02:28:13.830 --> 02:28:17.881
<v Speaker 4>described as absolutely devoid of fear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>big man,</v>

2576
02:28:18.940 --> 02:28:22.520
<v Speaker 4>grabs the unit of the dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five or 6,000</v>

2577
02:28:22.521 --> 02:28:26.120
<v Speaker 4>men in the dark and starts leading them </v>
<v Speaker 4>toward the objective.</v>

2578
02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:31.040
<v Speaker 4>Now you've got all these forts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more than 400 guns from the fort,</v>

2579
02:28:31.041 --> 02:28:36.041
<v Speaker 4>so then the guns on the German site,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just got to be this unbelievable </v>

2580
02:28:36.041 --> 02:28:38.891
<v Speaker 4>chaotic mess in the dark and this one </v>
<v Speaker 4>general has grabbed this unit and is and</v>

2581
02:28:38.961 --> 02:28:43.961
<v Speaker 4>is heading toward the city of Leon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is protected by this circle </v>

2582
02:28:43.961 --> 02:28:45.830
<v Speaker 4>affords right with men in between all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the forts.</v>

2583
02:28:46.250 --> 02:28:50.000
<v Speaker 4>He finds a spot that's undefended leads </v>
<v Speaker 4>this unit,</v>

2584
02:28:50.001 --> 02:28:55.001
<v Speaker 4>past the forts into the city on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>gamble that maybe the city won't be </v>

2585
02:28:55.821 --> 02:28:58.040
<v Speaker 4>defended or maybe if I walk in there </v>
<v Speaker 4>with 6,000</v>

2586
02:28:58.041 --> 02:28:59.690
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll just lay down their weapons.</v>

2587
02:29:00.990 --> 02:29:05.990
<v Speaker 4>Now the Germans don't have a lot to </v>
<v Speaker 4>celebrate in their military history and </v>

2588
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:07.470
<v Speaker 4>the Second World War because the cause </v>
<v Speaker 4>was so nasty.</v>

2589
02:29:07.620 --> 02:29:12.620
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know how many good things their </v>

2590
02:29:12.620 --> 02:29:12.620
<v Speaker 4>troops did in terms of military history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the military side of things.</v>

2591
02:29:12.690 --> 02:29:15.030
<v Speaker 4>The cause is so corrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taints everything.</v>

2592
02:29:15.270 --> 02:29:20.270
<v Speaker 4>The Germans can take some justifiable </v>
<v Speaker 4>pride in the adventure story of this guy</v>

2593
02:29:20.401 --> 02:29:25.401
<v Speaker 4>because first he walks in the city and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody just sort of surrendered to </v>

2594
02:29:25.401 --> 02:29:27.060
<v Speaker 4>him there and then he goes up to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>citadel,</v>

2595
02:29:27.061 --> 02:29:30.540
<v Speaker 4>the main defense in the center of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>city with his sword.</v>

2596
02:29:30.541 --> 02:29:35.541
<v Speaker 4>Hilt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he pounds on the door demanding the </v>

2597
02:29:35.541 --> 02:29:38.271
<v Speaker 4>surrender,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they open up the door and they </v>

2598
02:29:38.271 --> 02:29:40.090
<v Speaker 4>surrender.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yikes.</v>

2599
02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:44.380
<v Speaker 4>Talk about boldness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk about gambling.</v>

2600
02:29:44.830 --> 02:29:48.850
<v Speaker 4>This is a basically unknown German </v>
<v Speaker 4>officer who,</v>

2601
02:29:48.851 --> 02:29:53.851
<v Speaker 4>because of the name he is making for </v>
<v Speaker 4>himself will be in a position that some </v>

2602
02:29:53.851 --> 02:29:57.961
<v Speaker 4>historians will call the military </v>
<v Speaker 4>dictator of Germany within four years.</v>

2603
02:29:59.170 --> 02:30:02.600
<v Speaker 4>Name is Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gluten Dorf Luton.</v>

2604
02:30:02.620 --> 02:30:05.420
<v Speaker 4>Doris actions that night remind us once </v>
<v Speaker 4>again that even though,</v>

2605
02:30:05.421 --> 02:30:07.910
<v Speaker 4>as I've said several times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the machines have kind of taken over the</v>

2606
02:30:07.911 --> 02:30:10.070
<v Speaker 4>dominant role in war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting,</v>

2607
02:30:10.370 --> 02:30:11.930
<v Speaker 4>artillery,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guns,</v>

2608
02:30:11.931 --> 02:30:15.740
<v Speaker 4>all those things are machines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't discount the human factor.</v>

2609
02:30:15.890 --> 02:30:20.890
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the human factor is probably the </v>

2610
02:30:20.890 --> 02:30:23.051
<v Speaker 4>dominant factor amongst adversaries that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are somewhat evenly matched.</v>

2611
02:30:23.560 --> 02:30:25.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no amount of military genius is going to</v>

2612
02:30:25.581 --> 02:30:29.930
<v Speaker 4>save Belgium from Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The differences between the potential of</v>

2613
02:30:29.931 --> 02:30:34.931
<v Speaker 4>the two sides is just too great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but between relatively equal or only </v>

2614
02:30:34.931 --> 02:30:39.881
<v Speaker 4>moderately unequal power is leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could be the determining factor and the </v>

2615
02:30:39.881 --> 02:30:44.051
<v Speaker 4>boldness shown by Ludendorff that night </v>
<v Speaker 4>is a precursor to what we can expect </v>

2616
02:30:44.051 --> 02:30:46.610
<v Speaker 4>from him later on and what the Russians </v>
<v Speaker 4>can expect from him very,</v>

2617
02:30:46.611 --> 02:30:48.950
<v Speaker 4>very soon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2618
02:30:48.951 --> 02:30:53.951
<v Speaker 4>Ludin doors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very audacious capture of the city of </v>

2619
02:30:53.951 --> 02:30:55.010
<v Speaker 4>Leon doesn't solve the problem that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germans have because all those forts are</v>

2620
02:30:55.011 --> 02:30:56.990
<v Speaker 4>still active.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's taken the city,</v>

2621
02:30:56.991 --> 02:31:01.991
<v Speaker 4>he hasn't taken the forts and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>still there ready to shoot up German </v>

2622
02:31:01.991 --> 02:31:05.681
<v Speaker 4>march columns if those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're not taken before the big </v>

2623
02:31:05.681 --> 02:31:06.890
<v Speaker 4>march starts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so Ludin door calls for his,</v>

2624
02:31:07.140 --> 02:31:08.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ace in the hole.</v>

2625
02:31:08.510 --> 02:31:13.510
<v Speaker 4>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Germans have been planning for this </v>

2626
02:31:13.510 --> 02:31:14.330
<v Speaker 4>attack for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They knew that the Belgians might resist</v>

2627
02:31:14.450 --> 02:31:19.450
<v Speaker 4>and they knew if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had to have a weapon that was </v>

2628
02:31:19.450 --> 02:31:20.250
<v Speaker 4>greater than anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people who built</v>

2629
02:31:20.250 --> 02:31:24.300
<v Speaker 2>these forts ever envisioned in the 18 </v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties,</v>

2630
02:31:24.330 --> 02:31:27.450
<v Speaker 2>although some of these forts dates of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 18 nineties in that era,</v>

2631
02:31:27.870 --> 02:31:32.870
<v Speaker 2>the forts were basically guaranteed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Belgian government to be </v>

2632
02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:35.550
<v Speaker 2>invulnerable to any cannon then known in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

2633
02:31:36.150 --> 02:31:39.720
<v Speaker 2>but the cannons that were then known in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world are no longer the maximum size</v>

2634
02:31:39.721 --> 02:31:44.721
<v Speaker 2>cannons available in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those belong to the Germans and no one </v>

2635
02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:49.880
<v Speaker 2>even knew it until they first showed up </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the scene and they become an even </v>

2636
02:31:50.341 --> 02:31:53.210
<v Speaker 2>better demonstration than the machine </v>
<v Speaker 2>gunfire.</v>

2637
02:31:53.310 --> 02:31:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Mowing down those board Germans charging</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Belgian defenses that the weaponry </v>

2638
02:31:58.531 --> 02:32:03.531
<v Speaker 2>was simply doomsday device like if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine it magnified thousands of times.</v>

2639
02:32:07.320 --> 02:32:12.320
<v Speaker 2>The weapons that are on the way from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany to Belgium to reduce these forts</v>

2640
02:32:13.620 --> 02:32:18.620
<v Speaker 2>are the best example I can think of to </v>
<v Speaker 2>show how much has changed since the last</v>

2641
02:32:18.901 --> 02:32:23.901
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The great powers fought each other in </v>

2642
02:32:23.901 --> 02:32:25.671
<v Speaker 2>Europe 100 years before and nowhere is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that more on display in evident than in </v>

2643
02:32:27.031 --> 02:32:32.031
<v Speaker 2>artillery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which a hundred years ago during </v>

2644
02:32:32.031 --> 02:32:32.820
<v Speaker 2>Napoleon's time was already what </v>
<v Speaker 2>Napoleon thought,</v>

2645
02:32:32.821 --> 02:32:37.821
<v Speaker 2>decided battles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was a guy who made his bones in </v>

2646
02:32:37.821 --> 02:32:41.781
<v Speaker 2>the artillery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He rose through the ranks as an </v>

2647
02:32:41.781 --> 02:32:43.431
<v Speaker 2>artillery officer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's known for it's used on the </v>

2648
02:32:43.431 --> 02:32:45.891
<v Speaker 2>battlefield.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a guy that that could shock </v>

2649
02:32:45.891 --> 02:32:48.801
<v Speaker 2>people with the killing power of well </v>
<v Speaker 2>used artillery and his big guns were </v>

2650
02:32:48.801 --> 02:32:53.541
<v Speaker 2>firing 12 pound cannonballs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 pound cannonballs.</v>

2651
02:32:57.080 --> 02:32:59.910
<v Speaker 2>The gun itself weighed about 1200 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>

2652
02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:05.120
<v Speaker 2>It's the same gun essentially in in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>case that both sides in the US civil war</v>

2653
02:33:05.151 --> 02:33:07.520
<v Speaker 2>used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a 1200 pound canon.</v>

2654
02:33:08.540 --> 02:33:13.540
<v Speaker 2>The gun that's on its way and the guns </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are on the way from Berlin to </v>

2655
02:33:13.671 --> 02:33:17.630
<v Speaker 2>Belgium way the largest ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost 300,000</v>

2656
02:33:17.750 --> 02:33:22.010
<v Speaker 2>pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1200 pounds to 300,000</v>

2657
02:33:22.011 --> 02:33:27.011
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shell that Napoleon's 12 pounders </v>

2658
02:33:27.620 --> 02:33:32.570
<v Speaker 2>fired or between nine and 12 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shell that this monster,</v>

2659
02:33:32.900 --> 02:33:37.900
<v Speaker 2>the 420 millimeter version of it that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the way that Shell is 2000 pounds,</v>

2660
02:33:39.980 --> 02:33:44.980
<v Speaker 2>the Napoleonic era cannon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was so deadly at the time that it </v>

2661
02:33:44.980 --> 02:33:48.590
<v Speaker 2>was shocking at a range of an effective </v>
<v Speaker 2>range of about 2000 yards.</v>

2662
02:33:49.250 --> 02:33:54.250
<v Speaker 2>This weapon on the way to Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which isn't even designed for range at </v>

2663
02:33:54.250 --> 02:33:54.800
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a seed Canon,</v>

2664
02:33:54.801 --> 02:33:56.540
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't even have to fire very </v>
<v Speaker 2>far,</v>

2665
02:33:56.960 --> 02:34:01.960
<v Speaker 2>has seven times the range of that French</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannon that was designed to shoot far.</v>

2666
02:34:04.050 --> 02:34:09.050
<v Speaker 2>This is an entirely new kind of warfare </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the people who actually see this gun</v>

2667
02:34:10.621 --> 02:34:12.400
<v Speaker 2>once it's assembled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our slack,</v>

2668
02:34:12.401 --> 02:34:17.401
<v Speaker 2>jawed and assemble it must be because </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about trying to transport</v>

2669
02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:23.520
<v Speaker 4>this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now we're talking about a gun that is </v>

2670
02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:26.910
<v Speaker 4>just over a 16 inch gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the largest naval gun with the </v>

2671
02:34:26.951 --> 02:34:31.951
<v Speaker 4>exception of the Japanese Yamato Class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eighteen inch battleships ever put into </v>

2672
02:34:31.951 --> 02:34:36.601
<v Speaker 4>the field that the great American </v>
<v Speaker 4>battleships that Americans love to look </v>

2673
02:34:36.601 --> 02:34:37.180
<v Speaker 4>at from the middle to the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Second World War.</v>

2674
02:34:37.181 --> 02:34:42.181
<v Speaker 4>Those are 16 inch guns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These guns on the way to reduce these </v>

2675
02:34:42.181 --> 02:34:46.231
<v Speaker 4>forts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are those guns basically a tiny bit </v>

2676
02:34:46.231 --> 02:34:46.231
<v Speaker 4>larger?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How would you transport them?</v>

2677
02:34:46.231 --> 02:34:49.240
<v Speaker 4>We get some giant tractor with </v>
<v Speaker 4>caterpillar,</v>

2678
02:34:49.241 --> 02:34:52.900
<v Speaker 4>like wheels or something wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You didn't have any of that.</v>

2679
02:34:53.290 --> 02:34:57.310
<v Speaker 4>They have horses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they disassemble this almost 300,000</v>

2680
02:34:57.311 --> 02:35:02.311
<v Speaker 4>pound piece of equipment and they and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they transport it would like 35 horses </v>

2681
02:35:02.311 --> 02:35:03.430
<v Speaker 4>taking each piece,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2682
02:35:03.431 --> 02:35:06.430
<v Speaker 4>and anytime there's a dip in the road,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've got to get people to prop things</v>

2683
02:35:06.431 --> 02:35:11.431
<v Speaker 4>up and help him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes forever and then when they get </v>

2684
02:35:11.431 --> 02:35:11.470
<v Speaker 4>to Belgium and the roads are all messed </v>
<v Speaker 4>up and they have to take detours,</v>

2685
02:35:11.471 --> 02:35:14.200
<v Speaker 4>it takes forever to get these guns to </v>
<v Speaker 4>where they need to be.</v>

2686
02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:19.200
<v Speaker 4>And then when they get there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the crew and it's like a couple hundred </v>

2687
02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:20.710
<v Speaker 4>guys have to lay cement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cement has to dry,</v>

2688
02:35:20.860 --> 02:35:22.810
<v Speaker 4>the gun has to be assembled and put </v>
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>

2689
02:35:22.811 --> 02:35:25.180
<v Speaker 4>and then when they want to fire this </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

2690
02:35:25.181 --> 02:35:30.181
<v Speaker 4>this gives you an idea of the monsters </v>
<v Speaker 4>were talking about the gun crew had to </v>

2691
02:35:30.181 --> 02:35:34.831
<v Speaker 4>go three football fields away,</v>
<v Speaker 4>300 yards away and fire the thing </v>

2692
02:35:35.081 --> 02:35:40.081
<v Speaker 4>electronically and they were still so </v>
<v Speaker 4>close that they had to put cotton </v>

2693
02:35:40.081 --> 02:35:42.820
<v Speaker 4>wadding over their eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their nose and their ears,</v>

2694
02:35:43.270 --> 02:35:48.270
<v Speaker 4>and they had to fire this thing while </v>
<v Speaker 4>their mouth was open or they blow out </v>

2695
02:35:48.270 --> 02:35:49.720
<v Speaker 4>their eardrums and potentially worse </v>
<v Speaker 4>than that,</v>

2696
02:35:52.260 --> 02:35:57.260
<v Speaker 4>imagine what this weapon does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The shell is fired in a 4,000</v>

2697
02:35:58.160 --> 02:35:59.330
<v Speaker 4>foot arch.</v>

2698
02:36:00.350 --> 02:36:04.340
<v Speaker 4>It takes a full minute to get from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>gun to the target,</v>

2699
02:36:04.341 --> 02:36:08.660
<v Speaker 4>so you fire it and then there's the 62nd</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait until the explosion happens.</v>

2700
02:36:09.140 --> 02:36:14.140
<v Speaker 4>Unlike Napoleon's time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have cool shells that can be delayed </v>

2701
02:36:14.140 --> 02:36:18.470
<v Speaker 4>action fused and armor piercing so that </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you fire them at these forts,</v>

2702
02:36:18.710 --> 02:36:21.140
<v Speaker 4>they hit the top of the fourth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the kind of arc they have.</v>

2703
02:36:21.141 --> 02:36:26.141
<v Speaker 4>They don't fire flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's something they fire way up in the </v>

2704
02:36:26.141 --> 02:36:26.141
<v Speaker 4>air and then it drops right on top of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these forts,</v>

2705
02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:31.780
<v Speaker 4>a shell that pierces armor or concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then once it reaches its maximum </v>

2706
02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:33.500
<v Speaker 4>depth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it explodes.</v>

2707
02:36:34.810 --> 02:36:39.810
<v Speaker 4>The wonderful world of science and </v>
<v Speaker 4>engineering is going to take over the </v>

2708
02:36:39.810 --> 02:36:43.721
<v Speaker 4>battlefields of this upcoming conflict </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a way that has never happened before </v>

2709
02:36:43.721 --> 02:36:46.700
<v Speaker 4>and this weapon to me most symbolizes in</v>
<v Speaker 4>this early part of the war.</v>

2710
02:36:47.210 --> 02:36:49.580
<v Speaker 4>You know your example of here's your </v>
<v Speaker 4>wakeup call.</v>

2711
02:36:49.730 --> 02:36:54.730
<v Speaker 4>Here's your darth vader.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's what 20th century warfare is </v>

2712
02:36:54.730 --> 02:36:58.481
<v Speaker 4>going to mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The gun arrives along with some cousins </v>

2713
02:36:58.481 --> 02:37:02.100
<v Speaker 4>were slightly smaller from the also </v>
<v Speaker 4>great armaments workshop,</v>

2714
02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:07.120
<v Speaker 4>Skoda in Ostrow Hungarian territory then</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the weapons created by crop and </v>

2715
02:37:08.531 --> 02:37:13.531
<v Speaker 4>Skoda start shelling these forts and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they start going down and they start </v>

2716
02:37:13.531 --> 02:37:15.160
<v Speaker 4>going down fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

2717
02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:16.190
<v Speaker 4>those of you who have listened</v>

2718
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:16.970
<v Speaker 2>to many of my shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2719
02:37:16.971 --> 02:37:20.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a huge John Keegan fan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as a historian,</v>

2720
02:37:20.151 --> 02:37:25.010
<v Speaker 2>I think he's best on his World War One </v>
<v Speaker 2>and World War Two histories and he wrote</v>

2721
02:37:25.011 --> 02:37:28.340
<v Speaker 2>about this gun arrival outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fordson said quote,</v>

2722
02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:35.720
<v Speaker 2>after it was placed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bombardment began the crew wearing </v>

2723
02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:40.431
<v Speaker 2>head padding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lay prone 300 yards away while the gun </v>

2724
02:37:40.431 --> 02:37:42.810
<v Speaker 2>was fired electronically quoting </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody hit the scene.</v>

2725
02:37:42.811 --> 02:37:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Now quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 seconds ticked by the time needed for</v>

2726
02:37:46.351 --> 02:37:49.500
<v Speaker 2>the shelter traverse it's 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>meter trajectory,</v>

2727
02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:54.680
<v Speaker 2>and everyone listened in to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>telephone report of our battery </v>

2728
02:37:54.680 --> 02:37:57.861
<v Speaker 2>commander who had his observation post </v>
<v Speaker 2>1500 meters from the bombardment Ford </v>

2729
02:37:57.870 --> 02:38:00.870
<v Speaker 2>and could watch at close range the </v>
<v Speaker 2>column of smoke,</v>

2730
02:38:00.930 --> 02:38:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Earth and fire that climbed into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavens.</v>

2731
02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:09.200
<v Speaker 2>Keegan continues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quote the first of the shells delay </v>

2732
02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:10.530
<v Speaker 2>fused to explode only after penetration </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the forge.</v>

2733
02:38:10.531 --> 02:38:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Protective skin fell short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six minutes later,</v>

2734
02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:17.070
<v Speaker 2>the next was fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then five more.</v>

2735
02:38:17.130 --> 02:38:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Each of them walked up towards the </v>
<v Speaker 2>target.</v>

2736
02:38:19.830 --> 02:38:24.830
<v Speaker 2>As the elevation was corrected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the relentless approaching footfall of </v>

2737
02:38:24.830 --> 02:38:29.181
<v Speaker 2>the detonations spoked to the paralyzed </v>
<v Speaker 2>defenders of the devastation to come.</v>

2738
02:38:29.940 --> 02:38:31.740
<v Speaker 2>The eighth struck home.</v>

2739
02:38:32.040 --> 02:38:37.040
<v Speaker 2>Then the gun fell silent for the night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the next morning joined by the </v>

2740
02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:40.971
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which had completed the journey from </v>

2741
02:38:40.971 --> 02:38:40.971
<v Speaker 2>Essen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bombardment reopened,</v>

2742
02:38:40.971 --> 02:38:45.440
<v Speaker 2>the range had been found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and soon the 2000 pounds shells were </v>

2743
02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:47.760
<v Speaker 2>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stripping away armor plate and blocks of</v>

2744
02:38:47.761 --> 02:38:52.761
<v Speaker 2>concrete cracking arches and poisoning </v>
<v Speaker 2>the air with heavy brown fumes and quote</v>

2745
02:38:54.750 --> 02:38:58.150
<v Speaker 2>and Keegan then goes on to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2746
02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:00.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to murder the poor French </v>
<v Speaker 2>names of these forts,</v>

2747
02:39:00.301 --> 02:39:03.060
<v Speaker 2>but at 1230,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one fort is a wreck.</v>

2748
02:39:03.061 --> 02:39:08.061
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this physically incapacitated and </v>

2749
02:39:08.061 --> 02:39:10.521
<v Speaker 2>surrenders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They then shift fire to another fort </v>

2750
02:39:10.521 --> 02:39:13.641
<v Speaker 2>which surrenders five hours later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A third explodes when it's magazine is </v>

2751
02:39:14.521 --> 02:39:19.521
<v Speaker 2>hit by one of these shells completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroying the whole thing that will </v>

2752
02:39:19.521 --> 02:39:20.250
<v Speaker 2>happen to a couple of these forests by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

2753
02:39:20.460 --> 02:39:25.460
<v Speaker 2>and when they find those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Germans who were first on the scene </v>

2754
02:39:25.460 --> 02:39:28.731
<v Speaker 2>say that they look like quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a miniature Alpine landscape with debris</v>

2755
02:39:29.491 --> 02:39:32.340
<v Speaker 2>strewn about like pebbles in a mountain </v>
<v Speaker 2>stream,</v>

2756
02:39:32.670 --> 02:39:35.790
<v Speaker 2>heavy artillery and ammunition had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>thrown everywhere.</v>

2757
02:39:36.030 --> 02:39:41.030
<v Speaker 2>A cupela had been blown from its place </v>
<v Speaker 2>and had fallen on its dome and it now </v>

2758
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:43.470
<v Speaker 2>looks like a monstrous tortoise lying on</v>
<v Speaker 2>its shell.</v>

2759
02:39:44.940 --> 02:39:49.940
<v Speaker 2>As these forts began to fall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the artillery then closed in on the </v>

2760
02:39:49.940 --> 02:39:52.560
<v Speaker 2>fourth that had the general commanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole affair,</v>

2761
02:39:53.340 --> 02:39:58.340
<v Speaker 2>and he himself wrote what it was like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be under fire by weapons that no one had</v>

2762
02:39:59.221 --> 02:40:01.960
<v Speaker 2>ever seen the like of in human history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quote,</v>

2763
02:40:02.610 --> 02:40:06.510
<v Speaker 2>a shell rec to the arcade under which </v>
<v Speaker 2>the general staff were sheltering.</v>

2764
02:40:06.810 --> 02:40:11.810
<v Speaker 2>All light was extinguished by the force </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the explosion and the officers ran </v>

2765
02:40:11.810 --> 02:40:14.010
<v Speaker 2>the risk of asphyxiation by the horrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>emitted from</v>

2766
02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:16.170
<v Speaker 4>the shell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When the firing ceased,</v>

2767
02:40:16.380 --> 02:40:19.950
<v Speaker 4>I've ventured out on a tour of </v>
<v Speaker 4>inspection on the external slopes,</v>

2768
02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:22.350
<v Speaker 4>which I found had been reduced to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>rubble heap.</v>

2769
02:40:22.710 --> 02:40:24.330
<v Speaker 4>A few minutes later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he writes,</v>

2770
02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:29.630
<v Speaker 4>the bombardment was resumed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seemed as though all the German </v>

2771
02:40:29.630 --> 02:40:33.381
<v Speaker 4>batteries were firing salvos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody will ever be able to form an </v>

2772
02:40:33.381 --> 02:40:34.770
<v Speaker 4>adequate idea of what the reality was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

2773
02:40:34.930 --> 02:40:39.930
<v Speaker 4>I have only learned since that when the </v>
<v Speaker 4>big siege mortars entered into the </v>

2774
02:40:39.930 --> 02:40:42.420
<v Speaker 4>action,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they hurled against us shells weighing a</v>

2775
02:40:42.420 --> 02:40:47.420
<v Speaker 4>thousand kilos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The explosive force of which surpassed </v>

2776
02:40:47.420 --> 02:40:49.521
<v Speaker 4>anything known hitherto.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their approach was to be heard in an </v>

2777
02:40:49.521 --> 02:40:51.330
<v Speaker 4>acute buzzing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they burst with thunderous.</v>

2778
02:40:51.331 --> 02:40:54.540
<v Speaker 4>Roar raising clouds of missiles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stones and dust.</v>

2779
02:40:54.900 --> 02:40:59.900
<v Speaker 4>After some time passed and mid these </v>
<v Speaker 4>horrors I wished to return to my </v>

2780
02:40:59.900 --> 02:41:03.921
<v Speaker 4>observation tower,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'd hardly advanced a few feet into </v>

2781
02:41:03.921 --> 02:41:07.221
<v Speaker 4>the gallery when a great blast passed by</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was thrown violently to the </v>

2782
02:41:07.221 --> 02:41:07.221
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>

2783
02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:12.320
<v Speaker 4>I managed to get up and continued on my </v>
<v Speaker 4>way only to be stopped by a choking </v>

2784
02:41:12.320 --> 02:41:16.761
<v Speaker 4>clouds of poisonous gas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a mixture of the gas from an </v>

2785
02:41:16.761 --> 02:41:17.280
<v Speaker 4>explosion and the smoke of a fire and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the troops.</v>

2786
02:41:17.281 --> 02:41:19.080
<v Speaker 4>Quarters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were driven back,</v>

2787
02:41:19.260 --> 02:41:21.870
<v Speaker 4>half suffocated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking out of a peephole.</v>

2788
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:26.610
<v Speaker 4>I saw to my horror that the Ford had </v>
<v Speaker 4>fallen slopes and counter slopes being a</v>

2789
02:41:26.611 --> 02:41:31.611
<v Speaker 4>chaos of rubbish while huge tongues </v>
<v Speaker 4>aflame were shooting forth from the </v>

2790
02:41:31.611 --> 02:41:36.261
<v Speaker 4>throat of the fortress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My first and last thought he writes was </v>

2791
02:41:36.261 --> 02:41:39.921
<v Speaker 4>to try to save.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The remnant of the garrison are rushed </v>

2792
02:41:39.921 --> 02:41:41.400
<v Speaker 4>out to give orders and saw some soldiers</v>
<v Speaker 4>who I mistook for Belgians,</v>

2793
02:41:41.401 --> 02:41:44.400
<v Speaker 4>gendarmes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I called them and then fell again.</v>

2794
02:41:44.700 --> 02:41:47.390
<v Speaker 4>Poisonous gases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seemed to grip my throat as an</v>

2795
02:41:47.570 --> 02:41:48.890
<v Speaker 2>face end quote.</v>

2796
02:41:50.900 --> 02:41:54.380
<v Speaker 2>He woke up to one of his aides and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>German officer giving him water.</v>

2797
02:41:55.130 --> 02:42:00.130
<v Speaker 2>Those soldiers he thought were Belgian </v>
<v Speaker 2>were German and they were the first to </v>

2798
02:42:00.130 --> 02:42:04.781
<v Speaker 2>enter the fort after a shell detonated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the magazine and the entire </v>

2799
02:42:04.781 --> 02:42:09.701
<v Speaker 2>fort went up in a giant explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are enormous metal and steel and </v>

2800
02:42:12.411 --> 02:42:14.470
<v Speaker 2>concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2801
02:42:14.510 --> 02:42:19.510
<v Speaker 2>forts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guns were pulverizing forts that </v>

2802
02:42:19.510 --> 02:42:23.771
<v Speaker 2>were built to withstand the guns of just</v>
<v Speaker 2>a generation before and doing so with </v>

2803
02:42:24.080 --> 02:42:29.080
<v Speaker 2>ease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a demonstration of how much </v>

2804
02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:33.431
<v Speaker 2>things had changed just since the 18 </v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties and think of how much things </v>

2805
02:42:33.431 --> 02:42:35.810
<v Speaker 2>had changed from Napoleon's time to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>18 eighties.</v>

2806
02:42:36.320 --> 02:42:41.320
<v Speaker 2>This was a 19th century world </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovering the horrors of 20th century </v>

2807
02:42:41.841 --> 02:42:46.841
<v Speaker 2>warfare and they were going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn how to deal with this new reality.</v>

2808
02:42:47.420 --> 02:42:52.420
<v Speaker 2>One horrific bloody lesson at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lesson of leakage is at the era's of</v>

2809
02:42:55.780 --> 02:43:00.780
<v Speaker 2>basing your defenses on fortes is over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a lesson that will not be </v>

2810
02:43:03.871 --> 02:43:08.871
<v Speaker 2>learned and will be taught again in </v>
<v Speaker 2>France in May 19,</v>

2811
02:43:09.481 --> 02:43:10.050
<v Speaker 2>40.</v>

2812
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:16.240
<v Speaker 4>It's also my opinion that the Germans </v>
<v Speaker 4>are being taught a lesson.</v>

2813
02:43:16.270 --> 02:43:19.810
<v Speaker 4>Even as this story's going down and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guns are pulverizing,</v>

2814
02:43:19.811 --> 02:43:23.560
<v Speaker 4>the Fortune Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Germans should be picking up on what</v>

2815
02:43:24.280 --> 02:43:26.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>current events or trying to teach them.</v>

2816
02:43:27.010 --> 02:43:32.010
<v Speaker 4>They will never take that lesson to </v>
<v Speaker 4>heart and they will repeat these </v>

2817
02:43:32.010 --> 02:43:33.340
<v Speaker 4>mistakes that they're making in Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2818
02:43:33.820 --> 02:43:38.820
<v Speaker 4>in the Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's safe to say I think that the damage</v>

2819
02:43:39.371 --> 02:43:44.371
<v Speaker 4>done to the German reputation globally </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of what's going on in Belgium </v>

2820
02:43:45.040 --> 02:43:50.040
<v Speaker 4>won't go away until at least the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 4>fifties and I think you could make a </v>

2821
02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:54.061
<v Speaker 4>very decent case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never gone away and it involves </v>

2822
02:43:54.110 --> 02:43:59.110
<v Speaker 4>German treatment of neutral countries </v>
<v Speaker 4>and noncombatants wherever they find </v>

2823
02:43:59.781 --> 02:44:00.020
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2824
02:44:01.370 --> 02:44:03.920
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you watch this story unfold,</v>

2825
02:44:05.060 --> 02:44:10.060
<v Speaker 4>it's clear that in some respects the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germans just don't get it when you would</v>

2826
02:44:10.491 --> 02:44:12.420
<v Speaker 4>think they would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a country that in.</v>

2827
02:44:12.430 --> 02:44:17.430
<v Speaker 4>It's funny now they've lost this </v>
<v Speaker 4>reputation due to two world wars and </v>

2828
02:44:17.430 --> 02:44:20.561
<v Speaker 4>their involvement in both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they used to be considered an </v>

2829
02:44:20.561 --> 02:44:22.490
<v Speaker 4>absolute hotbed of human culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2830
02:44:22.510 --> 02:44:27.510
<v Speaker 4>the cutting edge of art and science and </v>
<v Speaker 4>literature and thought and philosophy.</v>

2831
02:44:29.061 --> 02:44:33.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean all these things that the Germans</v>
<v Speaker 4>really prided themselves in music,</v>

2832
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:38.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean an incredible people that guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>like hg wells were intimidated by,</v>

2833
02:44:38.760 --> 02:44:41.180
<v Speaker 4>couldn't help admire them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but was intimidated by how,</v>

2834
02:44:41.630 --> 02:44:44.800
<v Speaker 4>how ahead of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They seem to be at how advanced Asian to</v>

2835
02:44:44.801 --> 02:44:49.801
<v Speaker 4>be in all these areas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How strangely ironic though that people </v>

2836
02:44:49.801 --> 02:44:54.281
<v Speaker 4>that are so advanced in those areas </v>
<v Speaker 4>could have so many blind spots in areas </v>

2837
02:44:54.281 --> 02:44:57.020
<v Speaker 4>that one would think are related to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>higher culture aspects.</v>

2838
02:44:57.350 --> 02:45:01.160
<v Speaker 4>Do the people who are producing such </v>
<v Speaker 4>cutting edge higher culture,</v>

2839
02:45:01.370 --> 02:45:06.370
<v Speaker 4>how did they miss something that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>likely to be as damaging to your </v>

2840
02:45:06.411 --> 02:45:11.411
<v Speaker 4>international reputation as what history</v>
<v Speaker 4>now calls the rape of Belgium?</v>

2841
02:45:13.370 --> 02:45:15.920
<v Speaker 4>Now the rape of Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should point out a little bit,</v>

2842
02:45:16.460 --> 02:45:21.460
<v Speaker 4>is a propagandists fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they've made it into practically </v>

2843
02:45:21.460 --> 02:45:22.280
<v Speaker 4>a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The rape of Belgium.</v>

2844
02:45:22.520 --> 02:45:27.520
<v Speaker 4>Go see the rape of Dan King in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>history books and then you will see </v>

2845
02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:31.541
<v Speaker 4>something that propagandists did not </v>
<v Speaker 4>need to magnify it all to create a world</v>

2846
02:45:32.510 --> 02:45:37.510
<v Speaker 4>class historical atrocity killing field.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Belgium wasn't that,</v>

2847
02:45:40.310 --> 02:45:45.310
<v Speaker 4>but it was something and that something </v>
<v Speaker 4>would come back to haunt the Germans in </v>

2848
02:45:45.310 --> 02:45:47.300
<v Speaker 4>ways that they almost seem ignorant of </v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

2849
02:45:47.540 --> 02:45:49.550
<v Speaker 4>We quoted Hitler earlier about </v>
<v Speaker 4>propaganda.</v>

2850
02:45:49.850 --> 02:45:54.850
<v Speaker 4>Hitler sees it after the war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Germans were just blindsided by 20th</v>

2851
02:45:55.011 --> 02:46:00.011
<v Speaker 4>century global communications and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ability to manipulate world opinion by </v>

2852
02:46:01.041 --> 02:46:06.041
<v Speaker 4>taking things that were real facts and </v>
<v Speaker 4>blowing them up to levels that just </v>

2853
02:46:06.620 --> 02:46:10.160
<v Speaker 4>incensed whole societies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including countries.</v>

2854
02:46:11.150 --> 02:46:16.150
<v Speaker 4>The Germans don't understand that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way they're conducting themselves in </v>

2855
02:46:16.150 --> 02:46:19.151
<v Speaker 4>Belgium is affecting public opinion in </v>
<v Speaker 4>places like the United States,</v>

2856
02:46:19.820 --> 02:46:22.400
<v Speaker 4>which have large German American </v>
<v Speaker 4>populations by the way,</v>

2857
02:46:22.401 --> 02:46:23.690
<v Speaker 4>which are cheering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2858
02:46:23.691 --> 02:46:28.691
<v Speaker 4>the the feats of arms and how the German</v>
<v Speaker 4>military is showing themselves to be so </v>

2859
02:46:28.691 --> 02:46:28.691
<v Speaker 4>dominant.</v>

2860
02:46:28.691 --> 02:46:31.010
<v Speaker 4>American papers are not 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>against the Germans at this point.</v>

2861
02:46:31.130 --> 02:46:36.130
<v Speaker 4>In some places.</v>
<v Speaker 4>American papers are in regions that are </v>

2862
02:46:36.130 --> 02:46:38.980
<v Speaker 4>dominated by German Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they can't explain away what's </v>

2863
02:46:38.980 --> 02:46:42.290
<v Speaker 4>happening in Belgium and what starts the</v>
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

2864
02:46:42.291 --> 02:46:47.291
<v Speaker 4>The invasion of Belgium happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Germans start killing Belgian </v>

2865
02:46:47.291 --> 02:46:51.971
<v Speaker 4>citizens and they do so as part of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>is now understood to be a policy of </v>

2866
02:46:56.141 --> 02:46:57.770
<v Speaker 4>fruitfulness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As it was called,</v>

2867
02:46:57.771 --> 02:47:00.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure that's the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 4>translation of the term,</v>

2868
02:47:01.100 --> 02:47:03.460
<v Speaker 4>but the Germans intended to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2869
02:47:03.500 --> 02:47:08.500
<v Speaker 4>set examples of people that did things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the Germans had said you shouldn't </v>

2870
02:47:08.500 --> 02:47:10.890
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They said you shouldn't blow up bridges.</v>

2871
02:47:10.891 --> 02:47:14.460
<v Speaker 4>If they find you blowing up bridges,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are going to punish you and they do</v>

2872
02:47:14.461 --> 02:47:18.170
<v Speaker 4>not give probation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They will hang you.</v>

2873
02:47:18.171 --> 02:47:21.020
<v Speaker 4>They will shoot you if they catch you </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to blow up a bridge.</v>

2874
02:47:21.590 --> 02:47:24.050
<v Speaker 4>The Germans take that even farther </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

2875
02:47:24.380 --> 02:47:26.630
<v Speaker 4>If you're near a village,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're a bridge,</v>

2876
02:47:26.631 --> 02:47:29.330
<v Speaker 4>gets blown up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The village might pay the price.</v>

2877
02:47:29.331 --> 02:47:31.580
<v Speaker 4>The Germans believed in collective </v>
<v Speaker 4>punishment.</v>

2878
02:47:32.060 --> 02:47:37.060
<v Speaker 4>They also believed in taking hostages </v>
<v Speaker 4>for good behavior and when people did </v>

2879
02:47:37.060 --> 02:47:38.240
<v Speaker 4>stuff anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they killed the hostages.</v>

2880
02:47:40.320 --> 02:47:44.280
<v Speaker 4>This has been one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>contentious parts of,</v>

2881
02:47:44.730 --> 02:47:49.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new scholarship all the time on the </v>

2882
02:47:49.730 --> 02:47:50.610
<v Speaker 4>question of atrocities in Belgium </v>
<v Speaker 4>because,</v>

2883
02:47:50.770 --> 02:47:55.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>during the war it is this huge deal and </v>

2884
02:47:55.770 --> 02:47:55.770
<v Speaker 4>those of you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

2885
02:47:55.770 --> 02:47:59.691
<v Speaker 4>who've lived long enough to have seen </v>
<v Speaker 4>this same dynamic at work were real </v>

2886
02:47:59.691 --> 02:48:01.200
<v Speaker 4>atrocities happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember in the first Gulf War,</v>

2887
02:48:01.201 --> 02:48:02.460
<v Speaker 4>the stories of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2888
02:48:02.490 --> 02:48:07.490
<v Speaker 4>Iraqi soldiers taking Kuwaiti babies out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of incubators and throwing them on the </v>

2889
02:48:07.490 --> 02:48:10.140
<v Speaker 4>floor and then stealing the incubators </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all these stories are normal because</v>

2890
02:48:10.141 --> 02:48:15.141
<v Speaker 4>real atrocities are going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then they're magnified because the </v>

2891
02:48:15.141 --> 02:48:16.860
<v Speaker 4>magnification works to the benefit of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the enemies of the people.</v>

2892
02:48:16.861 --> 02:48:21.861
<v Speaker 4>The propaganda's working against the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germans went in and did a bunch of </v>

2893
02:48:21.861 --> 02:48:24.510
<v Speaker 4>things in Belgium that make them look </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad because they were bad,</v>

2894
02:48:24.690 --> 02:48:27.900
<v Speaker 4>and then the foreign media like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>British were fantastic at this.</v>

2895
02:48:27.901 --> 02:48:32.901
<v Speaker 4>Get Ahold of those stories and turn them</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the worst things you can ever think</v>

2896
02:48:33.001 --> 02:48:33.360
<v Speaker 4>of.</v>

2897
02:48:35.260 --> 02:48:38.680
<v Speaker 4>The Germans only began to get this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2898
02:48:38.681 --> 02:48:41.230
<v Speaker 4>a few people at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean later on,</v>

2899
02:48:41.231 --> 02:48:46.231
<v Speaker 4>much later on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Kaiser's Sonnet guy known as the </v>

2900
02:48:46.231 --> 02:48:49.171
<v Speaker 4>crown prince would say that Belgium's </v>
<v Speaker 4>when the Germans lost the first great </v>

2901
02:48:49.691 --> 02:48:54.691
<v Speaker 4>battle of the war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't lose it on the </v>

2902
02:48:54.691 --> 02:48:55.930
<v Speaker 4>battlefield.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They crushed the Belgians.</v>

2903
02:48:56.440 --> 02:49:01.440
<v Speaker 4>They lost it in the realm of global </v>
<v Speaker 4>public opinion because of their behavior</v>

2904
02:49:01.870 --> 02:49:05.380
<v Speaker 4>behavior that the Germans will use all </v>
<v Speaker 4>throughout this war.</v>

2905
02:49:05.381 --> 02:49:07.030
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the Second World War,</v>

2906
02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:12.060
<v Speaker 4>this tendency to ignore neutrality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and as we said earlier,</v>

2907
02:49:12.300 --> 02:49:14.100
<v Speaker 4>the German diplomat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2908
02:49:14.101 --> 02:49:19.101
<v Speaker 4>told the British diplomat this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to go to war over a piece </v>

2909
02:49:19.101 --> 02:49:19.101
<v Speaker 4>of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a piece of neutrality is often</v>

2910
02:49:19.101 --> 02:49:21.840
<v Speaker 4>violated in war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of how they thought.</v>

2911
02:49:23.220 --> 02:49:28.220
<v Speaker 4>They also thought that you treat </v>
<v Speaker 4>noncombatants harshly and you know,</v>

2912
02:49:28.711 --> 02:49:31.320
<v Speaker 4>to sort of soften that a little.</v>

2913
02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:34.920
<v Speaker 4>It's worth noting that the Germans treat</v>
<v Speaker 4>their own people this way.</v>

2914
02:49:34.921 --> 02:49:39.921
<v Speaker 4>They are a stern rather strict.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some would say severe society </v>

2915
02:49:39.961 --> 02:49:41.090
<v Speaker 4>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2916
02:49:41.100 --> 02:49:43.760
<v Speaker 4>the Prussian ised elements of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they expect,</v>

2917
02:49:43.820 --> 02:49:48.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obedience and discipline and conformity </v>

2918
02:49:48.820 --> 02:49:48.820
<v Speaker 4>to the rules and that's what they expect</v>
<v Speaker 4>of their own people.</v>

2919
02:49:48.820 --> 02:49:51.120
<v Speaker 4>And then they go into Belgium and when </v>
<v Speaker 4>people violate the rules,</v>

2920
02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:56.480
<v Speaker 4>they get treated harshly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Germans just failed to foresee maybe </v>

2921
02:49:56.480 --> 02:50:00.411
<v Speaker 4>with cultural blinders that people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>come from much less severe traditions </v>

2922
02:50:01.380 --> 02:50:06.380
<v Speaker 4>would maybe play that quality up as </v>
<v Speaker 4>something uniquely German and Nasty.</v>

2923
02:50:09.030 --> 02:50:14.030
<v Speaker 4>Not just that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should be pointed out that a lot of </v>

2924
02:50:14.030 --> 02:50:14.030
<v Speaker 4>different people's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2925
02:50:14.030 --> 02:50:18.100
<v Speaker 4>in the world at this time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're having problems dealing with </v>

2926
02:50:18.100 --> 02:50:18.240
<v Speaker 4>irregular fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was a big deal at the time.</v>

2927
02:50:18.241 --> 02:50:19.920
<v Speaker 4>Irregular fighting of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is when,</v>

2928
02:50:20.310 --> 02:50:25.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>regular people take up arms and starts </v>

2929
02:50:25.310 --> 02:50:25.310
<v Speaker 4>shooting at your soldiers like guerrilla</v>
<v Speaker 4>troops.</v>

2930
02:50:25.310 --> 02:50:26.310
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Vietnam,</v>

2931
02:50:26.490 --> 02:50:31.320
<v Speaker 4>the US fought Viet Cong guerrillas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very difficult to do causes all kinds of</v>

2932
02:50:31.321 --> 02:50:33.030
<v Speaker 4>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Atrocities tend to happen.</v>

2933
02:50:33.360 --> 02:50:35.190
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the British had just dealt with this,</v>

2934
02:50:35.191 --> 02:50:39.900
<v Speaker 4>not all together successfully in South </v>
<v Speaker 4>Africa where atrocity issues happened.</v>

2935
02:50:40.140 --> 02:50:42.810
<v Speaker 4>The French were dealing with it in Asia </v>
<v Speaker 4>and North Africa.</v>

2936
02:50:43.020 --> 02:50:44.820
<v Speaker 4>The Russians were dealing with it in </v>
<v Speaker 4>central Asia.</v>

2937
02:50:44.821 --> 02:50:47.040
<v Speaker 4>The Japanese were dealing with it in </v>
<v Speaker 4>China and Korea.</v>

2938
02:50:47.700 --> 02:50:50.100
<v Speaker 4>This is a problem a lot of countries </v>
<v Speaker 4>were having.</v>

2939
02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:54.300
<v Speaker 4>The Germans were very worried about what</v>
<v Speaker 4>were called free shooters today we would</v>

2940
02:50:54.301 --> 02:50:57.630
<v Speaker 4>call them snipers because in the war of </v>
<v Speaker 4>1870,</v>

2941
02:50:57.631 --> 02:51:02.631
<v Speaker 4>they had a lot of problems with snipers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they went into Belgium and if they </v>

2942
02:51:02.631 --> 02:51:04.800
<v Speaker 4>thought snipers were there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people paid the price left,</v>

2943
02:51:04.801 --> 02:51:05.460
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Center,</v>

2944
02:51:05.780 --> 02:51:10.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whole towns would be executed if a </v>

2945
02:51:10.780 --> 02:51:10.890
<v Speaker 4>sniper was loose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And here's the worst part.</v>

2946
02:51:11.610 --> 02:51:13.320
<v Speaker 4>Snipers may not have even been loosed.</v>

2947
02:51:13.320 --> 02:51:17.880
<v Speaker 4>Some historians say these are a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>gun shy soldiers who've never faced,</v>

2948
02:51:18.300 --> 02:51:23.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>live fire where someone was shooting at </v>

2949
02:51:23.300 --> 02:51:25.791
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They may hear some German soldiers gun </v>

2950
02:51:25.791 --> 02:51:26.520
<v Speaker 4>go off from the other side of town and </v>
<v Speaker 4>start killing civilians.</v>

2951
02:51:26.640 --> 02:51:31.640
<v Speaker 4>It's a very controversial issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some historians still foam at the mouth </v>

2952
02:51:32.281 --> 02:51:37.281
<v Speaker 4>about A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>John Keegan strikes me as somebody </v>

2953
02:51:37.281 --> 02:51:39.111
<v Speaker 4>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who feels this absolute need to defend </v>

2954
02:51:39.111 --> 02:51:39.111
<v Speaker 4>this idea of German,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2955
02:51:39.111 --> 02:51:39.111
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2956
02:51:39.150 --> 02:51:44.150
<v Speaker 4>devilishly this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a couple of pieces I liked </v>

2957
02:51:44.161 --> 02:51:46.830
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Author Lynn Mcdonald wrote about this.</v>

2958
02:51:46.831 --> 02:51:50.670
<v Speaker 4>I thought she did a very balanced job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so did Neil Ferguson and Ferguson.</v>

2959
02:51:50.940 --> 02:51:55.940
<v Speaker 4>What I love about Ferguson says he goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>and finds like the regional thing that </v>

2960
02:51:55.940 --> 02:51:57.160
<v Speaker 4>happened and then how it got blown out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of proportion.</v>

2961
02:51:57.161 --> 02:51:58.380
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but nonetheless,</v>

2962
02:51:58.620 --> 02:52:00.720
<v Speaker 4>all these people emphasize the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2963
02:52:01.410 --> 02:52:03.430
<v Speaker 4>These atrocities happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These people die.</v>

2964
02:52:03.431 --> 02:52:05.790
<v Speaker 4>The Germans practiced collective </v>
<v Speaker 4>punishment,</v>

2965
02:52:05.810 --> 02:52:07.630
<v Speaker 4>all these awful things that most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2966
02:52:07.960 --> 02:52:09.820
<v Speaker 4>most of us reviled today.</v>

2967
02:52:10.240 --> 02:52:15.240
<v Speaker 4>And then they paid an extra price for it</v>
<v Speaker 4>by providing the basic seeds that would </v>

2968
02:52:15.240 --> 02:52:20.131
<v Speaker 4>grow into enemy propaganda that would </v>
<v Speaker 4>turn the Germans into Genghis Khan </v>

2969
02:52:20.131 --> 02:52:24.661
<v Speaker 4>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly what Lynn Mcdonald </v>

2970
02:52:24.661 --> 02:52:24.661
<v Speaker 4>compares it to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and she writes,</v>

2971
02:52:24.661 --> 02:52:28.741
<v Speaker 4>quote in the United Kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Germany's on had already been tried and </v>

2972
02:52:28.841 --> 02:52:31.570
<v Speaker 4>found guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Germany's name was mud,</v>

2973
02:52:31.690 --> 02:52:34.360
<v Speaker 4>and now that she had condemned herself </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of her own mouth,</v>

2974
02:52:34.510 --> 02:52:38.380
<v Speaker 4>no rumor of Beast Gel outrage was two </v>
<v Speaker 4>vial to be believed.</v>

2975
02:52:38.650 --> 02:52:43.090
<v Speaker 4>They emanated mainly from the refugees </v>
<v Speaker 4>who had fled half terrified out of their</v>

2976
02:52:43.091 --> 02:52:45.520
<v Speaker 4>wits from the towns and villages of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Belgium.</v>

2977
02:52:45.790 --> 02:52:50.790
<v Speaker 4>They were the firsthand accounts from </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who had escaped from the flames </v>

2978
02:52:50.790 --> 02:52:54.271
<v Speaker 4>of Van den,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where 200 hostages had been shot from </v>

2979
02:52:54.271 --> 02:52:55.090
<v Speaker 4>two means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're 400 were gunned down and bayoneted</v>

2980
02:52:55.270 --> 02:53:00.270
<v Speaker 4>and from the inhabitants of not who </v>
<v Speaker 4>would arouse the ire of the Germans by </v>

2981
02:53:00.270 --> 02:53:03.550
<v Speaker 4>destroying the vital bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Germans revenge was to round up more</v>

2982
02:53:03.550 --> 02:53:05.380
<v Speaker 4>than 600 men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>women and children,</v>

2983
02:53:05.560 --> 02:53:07.090
<v Speaker 4>and shoot them in cold blood.</v>

2984
02:53:07.390 --> 02:53:10.720
<v Speaker 4>The youngest age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three weeks died in his mother's arms.</v>

2985
02:53:11.110 --> 02:53:14.740
<v Speaker 4>These stories were true and the Germans </v>
<v Speaker 4>made no attempt to keep them secret.</v>

2986
02:53:14.830 --> 02:53:18.610
<v Speaker 4>They were after all intended to warn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Inevitably,</v>

2987
02:53:18.611 --> 02:53:23.611
<v Speaker 4>as they traveled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they spawned fictions in their wake of </v>

2988
02:53:23.611 --> 02:53:23.860
<v Speaker 4>rape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of Macabre chillings,</v>

2989
02:53:23.861 --> 02:53:26.530
<v Speaker 4>of mutilation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of breasts and hands,</v>

2990
02:53:26.560 --> 02:53:31.560
<v Speaker 4>sliced off by sabers of crucifixions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of babies dipped into boiling water or </v>

2991
02:53:32.321 --> 02:53:37.321
<v Speaker 4>swung for sport against brick walls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were even whispers of cannibalism.</v>

2992
02:53:38.110 --> 02:53:42.670
<v Speaker 4>Grains of truth swelled and grew into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>crop of rumors of unspeakable.</v>

2993
02:53:42.671 --> 02:53:47.671
<v Speaker 4>Villainy is unsurpassed since the hordes</v>
<v Speaker 4>of Genghis Khan had rampaged and </v>

2994
02:53:47.671 --> 02:53:50.170
<v Speaker 4>pillaged across Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in France and in Britain.</v>

2995
02:53:50.171 --> 02:53:53.410
<v Speaker 4>The newspapers were full of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Public opinion hardened.</v>

2996
02:53:53.620 --> 02:53:58.620
<v Speaker 4>It was no longer merely adjust war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was positively righteous and people </v>

2997
02:53:58.841 --> 02:54:03.841
<v Speaker 4>were out for blood and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the Germans have recovered</v>

2998
02:54:03.881 --> 02:54:05.650
<v Speaker 4>from that image.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even now,</v>

2999
02:54:05.651 --> 02:54:06.190
<v Speaker 4>have they?</v>

3000
02:54:06.910 --> 02:54:11.910
<v Speaker 4>You talk about a misstep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if the Germans had treated neutral </v>

3001
02:54:12.371 --> 02:54:15.760
<v Speaker 4>countries and noncombatants with more </v>
<v Speaker 4>respect?</v>

3002
02:54:16.150 --> 02:54:18.430
<v Speaker 4>How different might their reputation be </v>
<v Speaker 4>today?</v>

3003
02:54:18.580 --> 02:54:23.580
<v Speaker 4>What if they'd learned from Belgium in </v>
<v Speaker 4>1914 and reacted differently in 1939?</v>

3004
02:54:25.900 --> 02:54:28.930
<v Speaker 4>One thing's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this whole idea of rightfulness in order</v>

3005
02:54:28.931 --> 02:54:30.280
<v Speaker 4>to cow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3006
02:54:30.310 --> 02:54:35.310
<v Speaker 4>the people that you had just subjected </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the boots of your soldiers that </v>

3007
02:54:35.310 --> 02:54:38.401
<v Speaker 4>didn't work out bad policy foundations </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the underpinnings of that idea.</v>

3008
02:54:40.600 --> 02:54:42.790
<v Speaker 4>It just didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the people in charge of it were guys</v>

3009
02:54:42.791 --> 02:54:46.720
<v Speaker 4>like von Moltke who said know to his </v>
<v Speaker 4>Austrian counterpart.</v>

3010
02:54:46.930 --> 02:54:47.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3011
02:54:47.441 --> 02:54:49.690
<v Speaker 4>it's brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are advanced into Belgium is brutal,</v>

3012
02:54:49.870 --> 02:54:50.920
<v Speaker 4>but what are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3013
02:54:50.921 --> 02:54:53.590
<v Speaker 4>we're fighting to save our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Basically,</v>

3014
02:54:53.591 --> 02:54:58.591
<v Speaker 4>this is life or death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be a little brutal for </v>

3015
02:54:58.591 --> 02:54:58.591
<v Speaker 4>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And guys like von Moltke,</v>

3016
02:54:58.591 --> 02:54:59.950
<v Speaker 4>he was one of these logical insanity </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

3017
02:54:59.950 --> 02:55:01.970
<v Speaker 4>Somebody asked him once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3018
02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:05.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the humane way to carry out war is?</v>

3019
02:55:05.750 --> 02:55:08.330
<v Speaker 4>And he famously said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make it quick.</v>

3020
02:55:08.630 --> 02:55:10.070
<v Speaker 4>Brutal as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Make it quick.</v>

3021
02:55:10.071 --> 02:55:12.620
<v Speaker 4>It's our old boxing analogy of on </v>
<v Speaker 4>multiple was basically saying,</v>

3022
02:55:12.621 --> 02:55:16.400
<v Speaker 4>knock him out quick knockouts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the nicest you can be,</v>

3023
02:55:16.401 --> 02:55:19.700
<v Speaker 4>even if it's horribly brutal to make the</v>
<v Speaker 4>knockout as quick as it is.</v>

3024
02:55:19.850 --> 02:55:21.860
<v Speaker 4>So von Moltke in this case is basically </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

3025
02:55:21.861 --> 02:55:22.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3026
02:55:22.251 --> 02:55:23.870
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's terrible.</v>

3027
02:55:23.871 --> 02:55:24.470
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3028
02:55:24.640 --> 02:55:26.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the end this is going to save lives,</v>

3029
02:55:27.710 --> 02:55:28.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

3030
02:55:28.190 --> 02:55:30.400
<v Speaker 4>you hang a few of these saboteurs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3031
02:55:30.540 --> 02:55:35.540
<v Speaker 4>you shoot a few of these people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>snipe at your troops and then they </v>

3032
02:55:35.540 --> 02:55:35.600
<v Speaker 4>stopped doing it and you don't have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>burn whole villages down.</v>

3033
02:55:35.601 --> 02:55:36.290
<v Speaker 4>See how that works.</v>

3034
02:55:38.300 --> 02:55:43.300
<v Speaker 4>Neil Ferguson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he addresses this issue is </v>

3035
02:55:43.300 --> 02:55:46.151
<v Speaker 4>basically sort of telling us to not be </v>
<v Speaker 4>so naive and we've all lived through,</v>

3036
02:55:46.700 --> 02:55:48.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're in the 21st century now.</v>

3037
02:55:48.261 --> 02:55:52.820
<v Speaker 4>We've had a long time to absorb the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas of 20th century propaganda and how</v>

3038
02:55:52.821 --> 02:55:57.821
<v Speaker 4>it's a legitimate aspect of war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things you do is perhaps </v>

3039
02:55:57.821 --> 02:55:59.180
<v Speaker 4>paint your adversary in the worst </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible light you can.</v>

3040
02:55:59.181 --> 02:56:01.640
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that the Germans weren't quite</v>

3041
02:56:01.700 --> 02:56:04.490
<v Speaker 4>getting when the 20th century was brand </v>
<v Speaker 4>new,</v>

3042
02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:07.070
<v Speaker 4>that they would get much better in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>second world war.</v>

3043
02:56:08.300 --> 02:56:11.660
<v Speaker 4>Ferguson in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tells a story where he talks about,</v>

3044
02:56:11.910 --> 02:56:16.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ways in which this propaganda were </v>

3045
02:56:16.910 --> 02:56:19.121
<v Speaker 4>used when he talks about how the British</v>
<v Speaker 4>newspapers would take photos sometimes </v>

3046
02:56:19.121 --> 02:56:21.090
<v Speaker 4>from stories that had nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 4>this war.</v>

3047
02:56:21.091 --> 02:56:26.091
<v Speaker 4>And one case stories with that had </v>
<v Speaker 4>photos from Russian pogroms against Jews</v>

3048
02:56:26.450 --> 02:56:27.800
<v Speaker 4>that happened before the war.</v>

3049
02:56:27.980 --> 02:56:29.270
<v Speaker 4>And then just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3050
02:56:29.420 --> 02:56:33.140
<v Speaker 4>captioning the photo with something that</v>
<v Speaker 4>says it's from this war.</v>

3051
02:56:33.141 --> 02:56:36.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean no one had any idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>show a bunch of dead civilians and say,</v>

3052
02:56:36.321 --> 02:56:39.530
<v Speaker 4>this is what the Germans are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ferguson writes quote,</v>

3053
02:56:39.980 --> 02:56:44.980
<v Speaker 4>but prewar photographs of Russian </v>
<v Speaker 4>pogroms genuinely were reprinted to,</v>

3054
02:56:45.290 --> 02:56:48.950
<v Speaker 4>in quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>illustrate stories of German behavior in</v>

3055
02:56:48.951 --> 02:56:51.280
<v Speaker 4>Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Sunday chronicle he writes,</v>

3056
02:56:51.300 --> 02:56:55.100
<v Speaker 4>was one of many British papers which </v>
<v Speaker 4>alleged that the Germans had cut off the</v>

3057
02:56:55.101 --> 02:57:00.101
<v Speaker 4>hands of Belgian children while the </v>
<v Speaker 4>former scaremonger William luck who </v>

3058
02:57:00.101 --> 02:57:04.390
<v Speaker 4>related with ill disguised relish the </v>
<v Speaker 4>quote wild orgies of blood and </v>

3059
02:57:04.390 --> 02:57:08.570
<v Speaker 4>debauchery and quote in which the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Germans allegedly indulged,</v>

3060
02:57:08.690 --> 02:57:13.690
<v Speaker 4>including the quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ruthless violation and killing of </v>

3061
02:57:13.690 --> 02:57:16.991
<v Speaker 4>defenseless women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Girls and children of tender age and </v>

3062
02:57:16.991 --> 02:57:20.540
<v Speaker 4>quote Ferguson continues quote other </v>
<v Speaker 4>writers had great fun imagining.</v>

3063
02:57:20.541 --> 02:57:25.541
<v Speaker 4>Sixteen year old girls being quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>forced to drink and quote unquote </v>

3064
02:57:25.541 --> 02:57:30.400
<v Speaker 4>violated successively and quote on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>lawn before having their breasts pierced</v>

3065
02:57:30.831 --> 02:57:35.831
<v Speaker 4>with bayonets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And quote the bayoneted baby Ferguson </v>

3066
02:57:35.831 --> 02:57:39.551
<v Speaker 4>says was another favorite image.</v>
<v Speaker 4>J H Morgan even threw in the charge of </v>

3067
02:57:39.620 --> 02:57:41.980
<v Speaker 4>sodomy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have little children and quote,</v>

3068
02:57:42.440 --> 02:57:47.440
<v Speaker 4>but even Ferguson is forced to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reality of the situation that this </v>

3069
02:57:47.440 --> 02:57:52.151
<v Speaker 4>stuff wasn't manufactured out of whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>cloth and that being a Belgium in the </v>

3070
02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:58.000
<v Speaker 4>line of German advance during this time </v>
<v Speaker 4>period was a very dangerous position to </v>

3071
02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:02.951
<v Speaker 4>perhaps find yourself in and perhaps of </v>
<v Speaker 4>no fault of your own Ferguson writes </v>

3072
02:58:02.951 --> 02:58:02.951
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

3073
02:58:04.450 --> 02:58:08.740
<v Speaker 4>although the Entente press wildly </v>
<v Speaker 4>exaggerated what went on in Belgium.</v>

3074
02:58:08.890 --> 02:58:13.890
<v Speaker 4>There is no question that the German </v>
<v Speaker 4>army did commit atrocities there in </v>

3075
02:58:13.890 --> 02:58:17.851
<v Speaker 4>1914.</v>
<v Speaker 4>According to evidence from the diaries </v>

3076
02:58:17.851 --> 02:58:18.130
<v Speaker 4>of German soldiers and other reliable </v>
<v Speaker 4>sources,</v>

3077
02:58:18.370 --> 02:58:21.370
<v Speaker 4>all the advancing German armies executed</v>
<v Speaker 4>civilians,</v>

3078
02:58:21.520 --> 02:58:25.690
<v Speaker 4>including women and priests altogether,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about 5,500</v>

3079
02:58:25.730 --> 02:58:28.720
<v Speaker 4>Belgian civilians were deliberately </v>
<v Speaker 4>killed by the German army.</v>

3080
02:58:28.930 --> 02:58:32.920
<v Speaker 4>Most of them in the 11 day period from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the 18th to the 28th of August,</v>

3081
02:58:32.921 --> 02:58:37.921
<v Speaker 4>1914 and at least another 500 in France.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Germans also used civilians as human</v>

3082
02:58:38.951 --> 02:58:42.040
<v Speaker 4>shields and raised numerous villages to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ground.</v>

3083
02:58:42.250 --> 02:58:47.250
<v Speaker 4>In one case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an 18 year old girl was bayoneted to </v>

3084
02:58:47.250 --> 02:58:49.651
<v Speaker 4>death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were also numerous rapes in </v>

3085
02:58:49.651 --> 02:58:52.261
<v Speaker 4>occupied France and quote John Keegan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who obviously feels very strongly about </v>

3086
02:58:53.591 --> 02:58:54.250
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3087
02:58:54.370 --> 02:58:57.370
<v Speaker 4>goes out of his way to point out that </v>
<v Speaker 4>these are not,</v>

3088
02:58:58.040 --> 02:59:00.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of ramshackle affairs,</v>

3089
02:59:00.460 --> 02:59:05.460
<v Speaker 4>that these involve lots of troops </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes that these executions are not </v>

3090
02:59:05.460 --> 02:59:07.900
<v Speaker 4>done by special execution squads is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will be the case in the Second World War</v>

3091
02:59:07.901 --> 02:59:12.901
<v Speaker 4>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but by regular units that the German </v>

3092
02:59:12.901 --> 02:59:12.901
<v Speaker 4>army,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he writes,</v>

3093
02:59:12.901 --> 02:59:16.171
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the victims included children and women </v>

3094
02:59:16.171 --> 02:59:18.850
<v Speaker 4>as well as men and the killings were </v>
<v Speaker 4>systematic at 10 means the hostages were</v>

3095
02:59:18.851 --> 02:59:23.851
<v Speaker 4>masked in the square,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shot down by execution squads and </v>

3096
02:59:23.851 --> 02:59:23.851
<v Speaker 4>survivors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bay and edit.</v>

3097
02:59:23.860 --> 02:59:28.860
<v Speaker 4>The execution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Squads were not as where the action </v>

3098
02:59:28.860 --> 02:59:29.980
<v Speaker 4>groups of Hitler's Holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially recruited killers,</v>

3099
02:59:30.130 --> 02:59:35.130
<v Speaker 4>but ordinary German soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Indeed those who murdered at end den </v>

3100
02:59:35.130 --> 02:59:39.180
<v Speaker 4>where the reservists of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>distinguished regimens of the Prussian </v>

3101
02:59:39.180 --> 02:59:39.280
<v Speaker 4>army,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guard regimen mentors,</v>

3102
02:59:39.290 --> 02:59:44.290
<v Speaker 4>will end quote and the Belgians would </v>
<v Speaker 4>have every right.</v>

3103
02:59:45.601 --> 02:59:49.170
<v Speaker 4>You would think when you to wonder as </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're living through this,</v>

3104
02:59:49.620 --> 02:59:54.620
<v Speaker 4>where their protectors are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they signed these agreements that </v>

3105
02:59:54.620 --> 02:59:57.270
<v Speaker 4>said that their independence was </v>
<v Speaker 4>guaranteed by the greatest powers of the</v>

3106
02:59:57.271 --> 02:59:58.860
<v Speaker 4>age.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where are those people right now?</v>

3107
02:59:58.861 --> 03:00:03.861
<v Speaker 4>When the Belgians need them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All they see are the German army </v>

3108
03:00:03.861 --> 03:00:04.140
<v Speaker 4>marching through and burning things and </v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps shooting people you know.</v>

3109
03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:09.540
<v Speaker 4>The answer is they're on the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The British are in the process,</v>

3110
03:00:09.541 --> 03:00:14.541
<v Speaker 4>right as we are in this story of landing</v>
<v Speaker 4>troops on the continent to aid the </v>

3111
03:00:14.541 --> 03:00:18.930
<v Speaker 4>French who are finishing the last bits </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the necessary ingredients so they can</v>

3112
03:00:18.931 --> 03:00:23.931
<v Speaker 4>launch an offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Russians are shocking everybody by </v>

3113
03:00:23.931 --> 03:00:27.621
<v Speaker 4>putting together enough units to at </v>
<v Speaker 4>least attack eastern Germany and remind </v>

3114
03:00:27.621 --> 03:00:30.540
<v Speaker 4>the German that you can't just leave </v>
<v Speaker 4>your eastern border undefended and throw</v>

3115
03:00:30.541 --> 03:00:32.610
<v Speaker 4>everything against France.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're still here</v>

3116
03:00:34.150 --> 03:00:39.150
<v Speaker 4>and the ostrow Hungarians are about to </v>
<v Speaker 4>find out exactly why the Serbs have such</v>

3117
03:00:39.491 --> 03:00:44.491
<v Speaker 4>a ferocious military reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All this is going to happen pretty much </v>

3118
03:00:44.491 --> 03:00:49.321
<v Speaker 4>simultaneously and it's going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first real consequential experiment to </v>

3119
03:00:51.221 --> 03:00:53.740
<v Speaker 4>test a hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sort of celeste deal,</v>

3120
03:00:53.741 --> 03:00:58.741
<v Speaker 4>if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or cosmic hypothesis concerning the </v>

3121
03:00:58.741 --> 03:01:00.280
<v Speaker 4>question of whether or not know if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>do it enough.</v>

3122
03:01:00.820 --> 03:01:05.820
<v Speaker 2>You can beat the violence out of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>society or a culture or people or maybe </v>

3123
03:01:08.741 --> 03:01:13.741
<v Speaker 2>given the globalization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that this time period helps </v>

3124
03:01:13.741 --> 03:01:17.401
<v Speaker 2>usher in maybe a world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the answer is that it depends on how</v>

3125
03:01:18.591 --> 03:01:23.591
<v Speaker 2>hard you beat them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess no one's been beaten very hard </v>

3126
03:01:23.591 --> 03:01:25.370
<v Speaker 2>yet in this story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Belgians are,</v>

3127
03:01:25.490 --> 03:01:28.580
<v Speaker 2>but an appetizer to what modern warfare </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to be like.</v>

3128
03:01:29.090 --> 03:01:31.940
<v Speaker 2>Modern warfare between the great powers </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the planet.</v>

3129
03:01:31.941 --> 03:01:36.590
<v Speaker 2>The first experiment in this hypothesis </v>
<v Speaker 2>of beating the violence out of societies</v>

3130
03:01:37.340 --> 03:01:42.340
<v Speaker 2>is on the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's an addiction to the human </v>

3131
03:01:42.340 --> 03:01:44.960
<v Speaker 2>species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's about to happen is the first dose</v>

3132
03:01:45.050 --> 03:01:48.130
<v Speaker 2>of shock therapy to see if we can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>curative.</v>

03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:18.780
<v Speaker 5>If you think the show you just heard is </v>
<v Speaker 5>worth a dollar,</v>

3141
03:02:18.930 --> 03:02:21.810
<v Speaker 5>Dan and Ben would love to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A buck a show.</v>

3142
03:02:21.870 --> 03:02:24.930
<v Speaker 5>It's all we ask.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go to Dan Carlin.com</v>

3143
03:02:24.931 --> 03:02:27.450
<v Speaker 5>for information on how to donate to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>

3144
03:02:29.100 --> 03:02:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Get their firstest with the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the phrase that made me </v>

3145
03:02:35.551 --> 03:02:40.551
<v Speaker 2>cringe during the editing process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listening to the show you just heard </v>

3146
03:02:40.551 --> 03:02:42.750
<v Speaker 2>because I could almost hear a five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

3147
03:02:42.751 --> 03:02:47.751
<v Speaker 2>15,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how many avid civil war </v>

3148
03:02:47.751 --> 03:02:47.751
<v Speaker 2>buffs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>American civil war buffs.</v>

3149
03:02:47.751 --> 03:02:48.420
<v Speaker 2>We have listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's going to be a sore point with</v>

3150
03:02:48.421 --> 03:02:50.520
<v Speaker 2>them and I could tell when I listened to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it during editing,</v>

3151
03:02:50.521 --> 03:02:51.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ugh,</v>

3152
03:02:51.330 --> 03:02:56.330
<v Speaker 2>do I really want all those emails?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't attribute that quote to anyone </v>

3153
03:02:56.330 --> 03:02:57.960
<v Speaker 2>I just said a confederate cavalry </v>
<v Speaker 2>commander,</v>

3154
03:02:57.961 --> 03:03:02.961
<v Speaker 2>but it was supposedly allegedly </v>
<v Speaker 2>legendarily said by a guy named Nathan </v>

3155
03:03:02.961 --> 03:03:05.700
<v Speaker 2>Bedford forrest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A controversial figure even today,</v>

3156
03:03:05.701 --> 03:03:10.701
<v Speaker 2>but that's not unusual among confederate</v>
<v Speaker 2>generals and it's not even unheard of </v>

3157
03:03:10.701 --> 03:03:14.571
<v Speaker 2>among union northern generals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forest is maybe in a class by himself,</v>

3158
03:03:15.360 --> 03:03:19.980
<v Speaker 2>but he's not controversial when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to acknowledging his military genius.</v>

3159
03:03:19.980 --> 03:03:24.980
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the best American generals </v>
<v Speaker 2>in this whole period in us history and </v>

3160
03:03:24.980 --> 03:03:29.271
<v Speaker 2>he's an innovative cavalry commander.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows and has already absorbed the </v>

3161
03:03:29.271 --> 03:03:32.040
<v Speaker 2>lesson that most European cavalry </v>
<v Speaker 2>commanders,</v>

3162
03:03:32.070 --> 03:03:37.070
<v Speaker 2>even in the first world war when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaks out that they haven't absorbed </v>

3163
03:03:37.070 --> 03:03:40.161
<v Speaker 2>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forest realizes that you can't use </v>

3164
03:03:40.161 --> 03:03:40.230
<v Speaker 2>cavalry the way it's traditionally been </v>
<v Speaker 2>used.</v>

3165
03:03:40.400 --> 03:03:42.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through its entire history.</v>

3166
03:03:42.241 --> 03:03:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Up until that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just too vulnerable.</v>

3167
03:03:44.281 --> 03:03:49.281
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The weapons had destroyed a lot of what </v>

3168
03:03:49.281 --> 03:03:51.711
<v Speaker 2>cavalry could do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so forest stripped down the job of </v>

3169
03:03:51.711 --> 03:03:55.851
<v Speaker 2>cavalry to the bare minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it do that nothing else can </v>

3170
03:03:55.851 --> 03:03:56.580
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it moves people faster than anything</v>

3171
03:03:56.581 --> 03:03:58.400
<v Speaker 2>else can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we used it for that.</v>

3172
03:03:59.110 --> 03:04:04.110
<v Speaker 2>He essentially had an elite unit of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mounted infantry and he would transport </v>

3173
03:04:04.131 --> 03:04:06.920
<v Speaker 2>these people too vulnerable and </v>
<v Speaker 2>important spots,</v>

3174
03:04:07.130 --> 03:04:12.130
<v Speaker 2>tactically important areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dismount them and use them as infantry </v>

3175
03:04:12.130 --> 03:04:15.491
<v Speaker 2>and then use the horses to skedaddle out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of there before superior force could </v>

3176
03:04:15.491 --> 03:04:15.491
<v Speaker 2>catch you.</v>

3177
03:04:16.070 --> 03:04:21.070
<v Speaker 2>It's a very modern way to use cavalry </v>
<v Speaker 2>and really the only way that it could </v>

3178
03:04:21.070 --> 03:04:22.220
<v Speaker 2>survive on a modern battlefield.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

3179
03:04:22.221 --> 03:04:27.221
<v Speaker 2>the battlefield that Nathan Bedford </v>
<v Speaker 2>forrest was trying to keep his cavalry </v>

3180
03:04:27.221 --> 03:04:28.580
<v Speaker 2>live on nowhere near as deadly for </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone horses,</v>

3181
03:04:28.581 --> 03:04:31.610
<v Speaker 2>especially as the battlefields would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1914.</v>

3182
03:04:31.880 --> 03:04:35.870
<v Speaker 2>Those battlefields or on the way the </v>
<v Speaker 2>appetizers over the main course is about</v>

3183
03:04:35.871 --> 03:04:40.871
<v Speaker 2>to begin this greatest army in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>is about to run into what is probably </v>

3184
03:04:41.781 --> 03:04:46.781
<v Speaker 2>the second greatest army in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Francis and the probably in terms of </v>

3185
03:04:50.420 --> 03:04:54.500
<v Speaker 2>bang for their buck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most elite military force,</v>

3186
03:04:54.501 --> 03:04:56.720
<v Speaker 2>most experienced military force in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

3187
03:04:56.960 --> 03:05:01.960
<v Speaker 2>All these Germans marching on France,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great train troops who've never been in </v>

3188
03:05:01.960 --> 03:05:06.371
<v Speaker 2>combat except against Belgians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to run into a British </v>

3189
03:05:06.371 --> 03:05:09.161
<v Speaker 2>colonial force that's tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that has so much experience that </v>

3190
03:05:09.161 --> 03:05:13.391
<v Speaker 2>there's almost no room for any more unit</v>
<v Speaker 2>owners for these units because they </v>

3191
03:05:14.301 --> 03:05:18.440
<v Speaker 2>fought in so many parts of the world so </v>
<v Speaker 2>long and so often they are not coming to</v>

3192
03:05:18.441 --> 03:05:19.250
<v Speaker 2>this war.</v>

3193
03:05:19.610 --> 03:05:20.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to learn on the job.</v>

3194
03:05:21.230 --> 03:05:26.230
<v Speaker 2>They've already done this job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many times they're going to be the only </v>

3195
03:05:26.230 --> 03:05:28.991
<v Speaker 2>truly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really experienced troops in this </v>

3196
03:05:28.991 --> 03:05:30.830
<v Speaker 2>conflict which will make them to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>back to our boxing metaphors.</v>

3197
03:05:31.190 --> 03:05:36.190
<v Speaker 2>Able to punch above their weight class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to give a lot better than </v>

3198
03:05:36.190 --> 03:05:40.631
<v Speaker 2>their small numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably indicate they would McCann </v>

3199
03:05:40.631 --> 03:05:41.120
<v Speaker 2>anything stopped this German steam </v>
<v Speaker 2>roller,</v>

3200
03:05:42.380 --> 03:05:47.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've often been asked by people how </v>

3201
03:05:47.380 --> 03:05:49.931
<v Speaker 2>large the army that defended imperial </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rome was and at its height,</v>

3202
03:05:53.330 --> 03:05:56.420
<v Speaker 2>the high number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you usually see a 750,000</v>

3203
03:05:56.421 --> 03:05:58.820
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the entire Roman empire,</v>

3204
03:05:58.850 --> 03:06:03.850
<v Speaker 2>that's not one arm you with the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>Roman empires know total number of </v>

3205
03:06:03.850 --> 03:06:04.530
<v Speaker 2>soldiers throughout the entire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3206
03:06:04.730 --> 03:06:08.540
<v Speaker 2>borders and interior of the places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe 750,000</v>

3207
03:06:08.541 --> 03:06:10.580
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven hundred and 50,000</v>

3208
03:06:10.581 --> 03:06:15.581
<v Speaker 2>guys is also the upper limit number as </v>
<v Speaker 2>we said in the show that Napoleon may </v>

3209
03:06:15.581 --> 03:06:18.470
<v Speaker 2>have used in his famous and for Lauren </v>
<v Speaker 2>invasion of Russia.</v>

3210
03:06:19.070 --> 03:06:24.070
<v Speaker 2>So that's a pretty big number just to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand what's bearing down on the </v>

3211
03:06:24.070 --> 03:06:28.471
<v Speaker 2>small British force that's landed on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>continent and this French force who's </v>

3212
03:06:28.471 --> 03:06:29.780
<v Speaker 2>waiting to find out what modern warfare </v>
<v Speaker 2>is really like.</v>

3213
03:06:30.800 --> 03:06:35.800
<v Speaker 2>The low number is 750,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germans just simply marching through </v>

3214
03:06:36.741 --> 03:06:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The high number is one point $5 million,</v>

3215
03:06:40.400 --> 03:06:45.400
<v Speaker 2>and that doesn't even count the troops </v>
<v Speaker 2>facing the French along the traditional </v>

3216
03:06:45.400 --> 03:06:48.350
<v Speaker 2>fortified hundred and 20 mile border.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's normally the invasion route.</v>

3217
03:06:49.010 --> 03:06:54.010
<v Speaker 2>You have the equivalent of the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>armed power of the Roman Empire at its </v>

3218
03:06:56.011 --> 03:07:01.011
<v Speaker 2>height using the Belgian road systems to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall on northeastern France.</v>

3219
03:07:02.160 --> 03:07:07.160
<v Speaker 2>That's an amazing blow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens when the irresistible force</v>

3220
03:07:09.240 --> 03:07:11.910
<v Speaker 2>in a runs into the immovable object?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3221
03:07:11.911 --> 03:07:16.911
<v Speaker 2>we'll find out if either one of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>titles turns out to be true in part to a</v>

3222
03:07:18.361 --> 03:07:19.650
<v Speaker 2>blueprint for Armageddon.</v>
