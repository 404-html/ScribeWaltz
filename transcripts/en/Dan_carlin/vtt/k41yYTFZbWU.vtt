1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.140
<v Speaker 1>How much time do you put into explaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>the development of a gap?</v>

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.400
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfect example of the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>question that bedeviled us in this </v>

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.930
<v Speaker 1>episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which covers by the way a ridiculously </v>

4
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.260
<v Speaker 1>short span of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the most important,</v>

5
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.340
<v Speaker 1>let's just say month or so's in human </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

6
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.540
<v Speaker 1>It represents the greatest mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>outpouring of organized violence that </v>

7
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.521
<v Speaker 1>the world had ever seen and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think there's ever been anything quite </v>

8
00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:33.521
<v Speaker 1>like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

9
00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:38.231
<v Speaker 1>the Second World War begins with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>German attack on Poland and fighting </v>

10
00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:40.010
<v Speaker 1>between Germany and Poland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's over rather quickly and it's like</v>

11
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.830
<v Speaker 1>eight months before the major powers </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually come to blows.</v>

12
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.570
<v Speaker 1>This war starts with all the major </v>
<v Speaker 1>powers coming to blows head on instantly</v>

13
00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:52.571
<v Speaker 1>on multiple fronts with casualties that </v>
<v Speaker 1>no one had ever even seen in their </v>

14
00:00:52.571 --> 00:00:56.801
<v Speaker 1>wildest dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time at speed.</v>

15
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.370
<v Speaker 1>And I started to realize as the program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.570
<v Speaker 1>it was happening that you can't get into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the minds of the people in the human </v>

17
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.431
<v Speaker 1>stories and the drama in the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>without getting into the military </v>

18
00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:13.431
<v Speaker 1>affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's.</v>

19
00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:16.770
<v Speaker 1>It's day to day progression because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the driving force.</v>

20
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.130
<v Speaker 1>That's what sets the timeline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what determines the turn in </v>

21
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.330
<v Speaker 1>fortune and that's what creates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.400
<v Speaker 1>the human impact on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we quote a reporter talking about </v>

23
00:01:29.341 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>what it looks like in the hospitals in </v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

24
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.820
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason that the hospitals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>full of hurt people and that's because </v>

25
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 1>the events on the ground continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictate what's going on,</v>

26
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 1>but the military affairs are complex as </v>
<v Speaker 1>all get out.</v>

27
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.950
<v Speaker 1>How much time do you spend on a gap mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>the battle of the Marne,</v>

28
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:53.991
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The famous miracle on the Marne is </v>

29
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:53.991
<v Speaker 1>determined by this gap in the enemy </v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

30
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>How much time do you spend on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why there's a gap.</v>

31
00:01:56.731 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that really is a war,</v>

32
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:01.980
<v Speaker 1>losing situation to have developed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get into that.</v>

33
00:02:01.981 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get into that,</v>

34
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.030
<v Speaker 1>you're starting to follow a line of </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail that just will take you off into </v>

35
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.060
<v Speaker 1>the weeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difficult story to decide when to go</v>

36
00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 1>off into the weeds and when to stay put </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the main road.</v>

37
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.710
<v Speaker 1>This is our attempt at explaining this </v>
<v Speaker 1>most complex and yet,</v>

38
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filled with human drama and great events</v>

39
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:27.321
<v Speaker 1>and larger than life figures and really </v>
<v Speaker 1>a changing of the guard in terms of,</v>

40
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one century to another as best as we can</v>

41
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:37.941
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dan Carlin approach to the first </v>

42
00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:39.200
<v Speaker 1>world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called blueprint for Armageddon and</v>

43
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>this is part two,</v>

44
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.100
<v Speaker 2>be some bus seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

45
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.160
<v Speaker 2>41 date which will live in infamy.</v>

46
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.020
<v Speaker 1>It's history.</v>

47
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.890
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

48
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.870
<v Speaker 1>The events</v>

49
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:05.660
<v Speaker 4>that dude</v>

50
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 3>figure it out from this time and place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take pride in the words,</v>

51
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 3>been the Alina,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tear down the drama.</v>

52
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.910
<v Speaker 4>Hi,</v>

53
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.760
<v Speaker 3>welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This kind of examination because people </v>

54
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 3>have got to know whether or not their </v>
<v Speaker 3>question well,</v>

55
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a crop if we dig deep in art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>history and art and remember that we are</v>

56
00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:48.960
<v Speaker 3>not descended from fearful of man.</v>

57
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.110
<v Speaker 1>It's hardcore history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What year did humankind acquire the </v>

58
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>capability to destroy itself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's an interesting idea,</v>

59
00:04:09.411 --> 00:04:14.411
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that every civilization in the </v>

60
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:18.671
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it continues to progress </v>

61
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:21.131
<v Speaker 1>technologically down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll reach a period when it can kill </v>

62
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:23.030
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either on purpose or accidentally.</v>

63
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 1>This fits into something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some physicists theories on what's </v>

64
00:04:31.041 --> 00:04:35.510
<v Speaker 1>called the Fermi paradox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this idea of reaching a danger point</v>

65
00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:38.990
<v Speaker 1>in your civilization is called the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>filter.</v>

66
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.220
<v Speaker 1>The fermi paradox is a famous paradox </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

67
00:04:43.221 --> 00:04:48.221
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>initially talked about supposedly by a </v>

68
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:50.951
<v Speaker 1>bunch of the great physicists in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world on their lunch break where they </v>

69
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:54.251
<v Speaker 1>had done the math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out the possibilities </v>

70
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:55.100
<v Speaker 1>of intelligent life being elsewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe.</v>

71
00:04:55.101 --> 00:05:00.101
<v Speaker 1>And the math is so overwhelmingly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>favor of the idea that there must be </v>

72
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:01.970
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's hundreds of billions of stars in</v>

73
00:05:01.971 --> 00:05:06.971
<v Speaker 1>our galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of billions of galaxies in the </v>

74
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:06.971
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like a slam dunk,</v>

75
00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:08.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then Enrico Fermi,</v>

76
00:05:08.931 --> 00:05:12.410
<v Speaker 1>famously one of the great physicist ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>famously then says to the group,</v>

77
00:05:12.411 --> 00:05:16.070
<v Speaker 1>so where is everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the Fermi paradox.</v>

78
00:05:16.071 --> 00:05:18.350
<v Speaker 1>If the math says they should be there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not there,</v>

79
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.000
<v Speaker 1>what's the reason they're not there?</v>

80
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the great filter comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in because some of these people who </v>

81
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.571
<v Speaker 1>study this stuff have suggested that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there might be a point in every </v>

82
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 1>intelligent civilizations development </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they acquire this ability to </v>

83
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.851
<v Speaker 1>destroy themselves and have to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the period where they have that </v>

84
00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:40.220
<v Speaker 1>capability and get to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they figure out how not to do that.</v>

85
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.090
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of like a pass fail test </v>
<v Speaker 1>for intelligence,</v>

86
00:05:44.091 --> 00:05:48.560
<v Speaker 1>civilizational growth everywhere in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe and sort of by its very nature,</v>

87
00:05:48.561 --> 00:05:53.561
<v Speaker 1>most civilizations don't pass it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe that's the reason they're </v>

88
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:53.960
<v Speaker 1>not all out there.</v>

89
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.620
<v Speaker 1>And guys like Nick Bostrom who study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 1>global catastrophic risk and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

91
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

92
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:07.271
<v Speaker 1>if a comment hit the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if nanotechnology goes out of </v>

93
00:06:07.271 --> 00:06:07.271
<v Speaker 1>control?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

94
00:06:07.271 --> 00:06:10.211
<v Speaker 1>it looks at all these issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He suggests that the earth entered this </v>

95
00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:13.511
<v Speaker 1>civilizational phase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this great filter period in our own </v>

96
00:06:13.511 --> 00:06:16.070
<v Speaker 1>history in 1945 when the atomic bombs </v>
<v Speaker 1>were first used.</v>

97
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Now I think about this in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war because I think that's </v>

98
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:28.481
<v Speaker 1>when people first realized that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings had acquired a military </v>

99
00:06:28.481 --> 00:06:33.011
<v Speaker 1>capability that was frightening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not frightening because your enemy had </v>

100
00:06:33.011 --> 00:06:34.160
<v Speaker 1>it frightening because human beings had </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

101
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.960
<v Speaker 1>You can go back and look at history and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of times when people were</v>

102
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:43.961
<v Speaker 1>afraid of the deadliness of weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were afraid of the deadliness </v>

103
00:06:43.961 --> 00:06:47.651
<v Speaker 1>of weapons either because they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid themselves of getting killed or </v>

104
00:06:47.651 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 1>their country of getting taken over </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

105
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.020
<v Speaker 1>They weren't afraid for the species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't afraid for civilization as </v>

106
00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:55.250
<v Speaker 1>a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the closest you'll see,</v>

107
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

108
00:06:56.601 --> 00:07:01.601
<v Speaker 1>with that coming is you'll have like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mongol invasion or invasion from the </v>

109
00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:01.601
<v Speaker 1>step and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

110
00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:05.210
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it strikes the subtle civilizations a </v>

111
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.890
<v Speaker 1>bit like a wave and it washes up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of civilization up on the</v>

112
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 1>beach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't destroy everything in the</v>

113
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:15.701
<v Speaker 1>19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first time period where you </v>

114
00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:19.391
<v Speaker 1>can read writings from people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>asserting that maybe what they're </v>

115
00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:21.350
<v Speaker 1>developing battlefield capability wise </v>
<v Speaker 1>can destroy everything.</v>

116
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Speaker 1>Now their version of everything is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit different than ours.</v>

117
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.790
<v Speaker 1>When we talk about things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential risk,</v>

118
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.760
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about the survival of life</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the planet.</v>

119
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:36.170
<v Speaker 1>That's a post atomic you no idea of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>existential risk means.</v>

120
00:07:36.171 --> 00:07:36.920
<v Speaker 1>We understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

121
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:41.921
<v Speaker 1>you have a nuclear war amongst all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great powers and you can kiss life on </v>

122
00:07:41.921 --> 00:07:45.080
<v Speaker 1>earth goodbye or certainly our level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

123
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.620
<v Speaker 1>You've heard that phrase bomb someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the stone age.</v>

124
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.380
<v Speaker 1>What we modern people have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>capability to do that,</v>

125
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was in the 19th century that the,</v>

126
00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:00.130
<v Speaker 1>that the idea that that's what a major </v>
<v Speaker 1>war between the major powers might </v>

127
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.210
<v Speaker 1>amount to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when that idea takes hold.</v>

128
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Those people are worried about </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition number two of existential </v>

129
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:08.240
<v Speaker 1>threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

130
00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:10.250
<v Speaker 1>guys like Nick Bostrom have two </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitions.</v>

131
00:08:10.251 --> 00:08:13.130
<v Speaker 1>One is the one we think about wiped out </v>
<v Speaker 1>life on earth,</v>

132
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.670
<v Speaker 1>but the other definition of what an </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential threat is,</v>

133
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.240
<v Speaker 1>is being knocked back down a few rungs </v>
<v Speaker 1>on your level of civilization and then </v>

134
00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:26.750
<v Speaker 1>never finding your way back to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>former greatness.</v>

135
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.430
<v Speaker 1>You know to have a statue of liberty in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sand moment design,</v>

136
00:08:32.431 --> 00:08:35.360
<v Speaker 1>I like to call it where you look up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the statue of Liberty,</v>

137
00:08:35.361 --> 00:08:40.361
<v Speaker 1>like in the planet of the apes coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the sand and you instantly </v>

138
00:08:40.361 --> 00:08:43.271
<v Speaker 1>realize in a blinding flash of light </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're living in an era that is off</v>

139
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:48.620
<v Speaker 1>the civilizational highs and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people writing in the late 19th,</v>

140
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.680
<v Speaker 1>early 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in places like Great Britain </v>

141
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 1>and the United States where everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems just great.</v>

142
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we have to screw up with a war</v>

143
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.960
<v Speaker 5>and really nothing to gain and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything to lose.</v>

144
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:03.020
<v Speaker 5>Those people are writing about living in</v>
<v Speaker 5>a golden age that they believe is </v>

145
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.521
<v Speaker 5>fragile and that these giant war </v>
<v Speaker 5>machines that are equally deadly in </v>

146
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:10.890
<v Speaker 5>terms of their abilities to kill people </v>
<v Speaker 5>on the battlefield,</v>

147
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:16.250
<v Speaker 5>but also their ability to simply </v>
<v Speaker 5>bankrupt the societies that have to </v>

148
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:20.091
<v Speaker 5>maintain them is causing consternation </v>
<v Speaker 5>and end the very weapons systems </v>

149
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:23.010
<v Speaker 5>themselves and the arms races that </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're having.</v>

150
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:28.610
<v Speaker 5>Create more opportunities for some sort </v>
<v Speaker 5>of violent outbreak of war that will </v>

151
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:34.071
<v Speaker 5>then see these things employed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The funny thing about human history,</v>

152
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:38.790
<v Speaker 5>if you study military history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that up until about 200 years ago,</v>

153
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:44.090
<v Speaker 5>you can imagine armies from a very long </v>
<v Speaker 5>time ago fighting and beating armies </v>

154
00:09:45.841 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 5>from.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not that long ago.</v>

155
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:52.380
<v Speaker 5>I mean Alexander the Great's Army I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think beats the Carolingian army of </v>

156
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.100
<v Speaker 5>Charlemagne,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

157
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:58.370
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a first rate army a thousand years </v>

158
00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:58.370
<v Speaker 5>later,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they must.</v>

159
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:03.290
<v Speaker 5>The Macedonians must their hair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there are books like Arthur </v>

160
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:03.290
<v Speaker 5>Pharaohs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the origins of war,</v>

161
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:08.260
<v Speaker 5>where that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that credible historian can't help but </v>

162
00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.541
<v Speaker 5>play with the battle of Waterloo </v>
<v Speaker 5>inserting Alexander and his Macedonians </v>

163
00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:15.770
<v Speaker 5>from the thirties bce in the place of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Napoleon and his French sending the </v>

164
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.671
<v Speaker 5>Macedonians up against the Duke of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Wellington and his British and their </v>

165
00:10:19.671 --> 00:10:23.571
<v Speaker 5>coalition allies and having Alexander in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Macedonians do at least as well as </v>

166
00:10:23.571 --> 00:10:26.310
<v Speaker 5>Napoleon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what does that show you?</v>

167
00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it shows you how all of human military </v>

168
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.761
<v Speaker 5>history changes at about the time of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Napoleonic wars because all of a sudden </v>

169
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.340
<v Speaker 5>a new law of historical nature takes </v>
<v Speaker 5>over,</v>

170
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.640
<v Speaker 5>which says that earlier armies do not </v>
<v Speaker 5>beat later.</v>

171
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:45.480
<v Speaker 5>Armies mean the rules changed a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 5>percent.</v>

172
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.800
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>think about today,</v>

173
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.980
<v Speaker 5>if you took the US army from today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to fight a battle against the US </v>

174
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.360
<v Speaker 5>army of 1945.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Today's US army destroys that Second </v>

175
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
<v Speaker 5>World War Army,</v>
<v Speaker 5>mid 20th century army and maybe doesn't </v>

176
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.010
<v Speaker 5>lose a man when they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that 19,</v>

177
00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:06.480
<v Speaker 5>45 us army would defeat easily any army </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the first world war.</v>

178
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:11.960
<v Speaker 5>Any army from the first world war of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>major powers would easily defeat the </v>

179
00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.190
<v Speaker 5>United States in the US civil war and </v>
<v Speaker 5>those civil war armies,</v>

180
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.450
<v Speaker 5>if they went back to waterloo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

181
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:21.470
<v Speaker 5>beat Napoleon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's sort of the rule of the law of</v>

182
00:11:21.721 --> 00:11:24.930
<v Speaker 5>technological battlefield development </v>
<v Speaker 5>for the last 200 years.</v>

183
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.080
<v Speaker 5>And that's what the people in this story</v>
<v Speaker 5>have had to try to suck up and </v>

184
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.231
<v Speaker 5>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In 1700 some ruler can decide on a new </v>

185
00:11:33.231 --> 00:11:35.190
<v Speaker 5>musket design and not change it for 100 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

186
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.760
<v Speaker 5>And he still probably okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the 19th century,</v>

187
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.540
<v Speaker 5>if you miss 15 years of development in </v>
<v Speaker 5>rifle technology,</v>

188
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.870
<v Speaker 5>you might lose a war because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

189
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:50.871
<v Speaker 5>think about something like the naval </v>
<v Speaker 5>arms races and how this just destroyed </v>

190
00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:52.590
<v Speaker 5>everybody's treasuries and everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>else,</v>

191
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:58.020
<v Speaker 5>but at the beginning of the 18 hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 5>you are using ship of the line type </v>

192
00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

193
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the same naval technology of giant </v>

194
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.840
<v Speaker 5>wooden ships with cannons all in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>side that's been the way things had been</v>

195
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:09.841
<v Speaker 5>done for a couple centuries and when you</v>
<v Speaker 5>build a ship and spend all that money </v>

196
00:12:09.841 --> 00:12:11.500
<v Speaker 5>and all that time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's good for a long time.</v>

197
00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:14.710
<v Speaker 5>If it doesn't get destroyed in battle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that ship conserve you for 20,</v>

198
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:17.080
<v Speaker 5>30 years and just be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Great investment.</v>

199
00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:20.470
<v Speaker 5>Pay off over time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you amortize and call siloed over the</v>

200
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:21.260
<v Speaker 5>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

201
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.940
<v Speaker 5>that goes away at the end of the 19th </v>
<v Speaker 5>century.</v>

202
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:25.810
<v Speaker 5>And yet</v>

203
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:32.100
<v Speaker 5>the cost explodes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You look at a battleship from 1900 and </v>

204
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:35.110
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't look like anything from </v>
<v Speaker 5>Napoleon's time.</v>

205
00:12:35.111 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 5>It looked like a thoroughly modern </v>
<v Speaker 5>battleship.</v>

206
00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:42.091
<v Speaker 5>The problem is is technology is changing</v>
<v Speaker 5>so fast now that in the time it takes </v>

207
00:12:42.091 --> 00:12:46.681
<v Speaker 5>you to design that new battleship,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the two or so years it takes to build </v>

208
00:12:46.681 --> 00:12:50.551
<v Speaker 5>and launch and finish it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it may be outdated by the time it's </v>

209
00:12:50.551 --> 00:12:53.851
<v Speaker 5>ready to be used.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You take a first class,</v>

210
00:12:54.261 --> 00:12:56.090
<v Speaker 5>first rate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

211
00:12:56.091 --> 00:13:01.091
<v Speaker 5>fleet from a global power in 1914 and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you pitted in battle against a first </v>

212
00:13:01.641 --> 00:13:04.970
<v Speaker 5>rate top of the line fleet from a mere </v>
<v Speaker 5>14 years ago,</v>

213
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:10.630
<v Speaker 5>and the one from 1914 destroys the one </v>
<v Speaker 5>from 1900 and maybe doesn't lose a major</v>

214
00:13:11.451 --> 00:13:13.220
<v Speaker 5>surface vessel while doing so.</v>

215
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:19.970
<v Speaker 5>That is mind boggling to the people who </v>
<v Speaker 5>lived back then because that means if </v>

216
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:24.021
<v Speaker 5>you can't keep up technologically with </v>
<v Speaker 5>what your neighbor is doing at great </v>

217
00:13:24.021 --> 00:13:27.771
<v Speaker 5>expense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can negate all the money you spent </v>

218
00:13:27.771 --> 00:13:30.180
<v Speaker 5>on that fleet in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Better to not have that fleet from 1900.</v>

219
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:35.420
<v Speaker 5>If you're just gonna lose the whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing and not even sink one of your </v>

220
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.241
<v Speaker 5>enemies ships.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The need to keep up with the killing </v>

221
00:13:38.241 --> 00:13:41.721
<v Speaker 5>power of everyone else was impacting the</v>
<v Speaker 5>treasuries of these countries in ways </v>

222
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:46.850
<v Speaker 5>that created just as big of a threat to </v>
<v Speaker 5>their continued existence as the threat </v>

223
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.890
<v Speaker 5>of all these dangerous armies did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a catch 22 for them.</v>

224
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:55.070
<v Speaker 5>Take the role that the Russian czar </v>
<v Speaker 5>found himself in in 18,</v>

225
00:13:55.351 --> 00:14:00.351
<v Speaker 5>98,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a guy named Nicholas the second maybe </v>

226
00:14:00.351 --> 00:14:00.351
<v Speaker 5>the single most powerful person on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>planet,</v>

227
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.170
<v Speaker 5>he's got a shaky regime,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a lot of revolution.</v>

228
00:14:04.171 --> 00:14:08.010
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of discontent and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is exacerbated by the costs of trying</v>

229
00:14:08.011 --> 00:14:12.030
<v Speaker 5>to keep up a modern military and even </v>
<v Speaker 5>with all these costs,</v>

230
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:17.120
<v Speaker 5>he's falling behind rushes to </v>
<v Speaker 5>illiterate.</v>

231
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:22.590
<v Speaker 5>It's industries are too small.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's society still needs so much </v>

232
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.240
<v Speaker 5>modernization before it can keep up with</v>
<v Speaker 5>places like Germany and France and Great</v>

233
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.240
<v Speaker 5>Britain and even the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is is that the czars power </v>

234
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.441
<v Speaker 5>is all in the country's size and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>population and that's becoming less and </v>

235
00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:39.151
<v Speaker 5>less important as technology begins to </v>
<v Speaker 5>determine who wins and who loses </v>

236
00:14:39.151 --> 00:14:43.231
<v Speaker 5>battles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's being demonstrated all </v>

237
00:14:43.231 --> 00:14:45.481
<v Speaker 5>through the 19th century as these small </v>
<v Speaker 5>colonial armies from the technologically</v>

238
00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:50.671
<v Speaker 5>sophisticated powers destroys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes giant armies of tribal natives</v>

239
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.340
<v Speaker 5>all over the world.</v>

240
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:56.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean that line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a famous one that says whatever happens,</v>

241
00:14:56.691 --> 00:15:01.691
<v Speaker 1>we have got the maximum gun and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have not is about using machine guns on </v>

242
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:07.090
<v Speaker 1>tribal peoples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Russian czar is looking ahead and </v>

243
00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:09.830
<v Speaker 1>seeing that if he can't keep up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this technological arms race,</v>

244
00:15:09.831 --> 00:15:12.530
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be never ending and </v>
<v Speaker 1>endlessly expensive.</v>

245
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:18.040
<v Speaker 1>The Russians are just going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>new tribal peoples and yet he has to </v>

246
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.871
<v Speaker 1>have this modern military machine </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if his adversaries have it and </v>

247
00:15:22.871 --> 00:15:24.740
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to lose any war he gets into.</v>

248
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:27.920
<v Speaker 1>He loses his dynasty potentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either way.</v>

249
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.340
<v Speaker 1>How do you get out of a mess like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 18,</v>

250
00:15:31.341 --> 00:15:36.341
<v Speaker 1>98?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Russians are things he finds a way </v>

251
00:15:36.341 --> 00:15:40.480
<v Speaker 1>and he issues a public invitation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>representatives from the other great </v>

252
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.420
<v Speaker 1>powers who are one degree or another in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same boat he's into.</v>

253
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.300
<v Speaker 1>No one knows what the next major war </v>
<v Speaker 1>will look like,</v>

254
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:54.570
<v Speaker 1>but everybody's had a chance to see some</v>
<v Speaker 1>minor wars in the meantime and if you </v>

255
00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:56.530
<v Speaker 1>sort of extrapolate what what they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling you,</v>

256
00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.050
<v Speaker 1>the next war is going to be horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Nicholas,</v>

257
00:15:59.051 --> 00:16:04.051
<v Speaker 1>the second was actually reading the Guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who turned out to be one of the most </v>

258
00:16:04.051 --> 00:16:07.800
<v Speaker 1>accurate prognosticators of what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next war was going to be like we talked </v>

259
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.590
<v Speaker 1>about in the last show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been blocked.</v>

260
00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second is reading Ivan Block and </v>

261
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.610
<v Speaker 1>blocks predictions are horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the czar wants out.</v>

262
00:16:15.611 --> 00:16:20.611
<v Speaker 1>He wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to figure out a way to stop </v>

263
00:16:20.611 --> 00:16:22.591
<v Speaker 1>this dangerous cycle that the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>world seems to be forcing all the great </v>

264
00:16:22.591 --> 00:16:26.371
<v Speaker 1>powers into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a wonderful sort of </v>

265
00:16:26.371 --> 00:16:29.910
<v Speaker 1>commentary on the attitude of the Times </v>
<v Speaker 1>that these guys thought that they could </v>

266
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:33.841
<v Speaker 1>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like rainbows and Unicorns to </v>

267
00:16:33.841 --> 00:16:33.841
<v Speaker 1>we modern people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to then they must have thought,</v>

268
00:16:33.841 --> 00:16:36.370
<v Speaker 1>reasonable people can sit down over </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigars and whiskey.</v>

269
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.220
<v Speaker 1>See this dynamic that we've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves caught up in,</v>

270
00:16:39.221 --> 00:16:44.221
<v Speaker 1>realized that it's in no one's interest </v>
<v Speaker 1>in reasonable people can figure a way </v>

271
00:16:44.221 --> 00:16:45.220
<v Speaker 1>out of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in 18,</v>

272
00:16:45.221 --> 00:16:50.221
<v Speaker 1>98,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the czar of Russia proposed something </v>

273
00:16:50.221 --> 00:16:51.070
<v Speaker 1>that will be called The Hague conference</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with this.</v>

274
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:57.970
<v Speaker 1>There are many ways to look at the 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety Nine Hague conference and </v>

275
00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.750
<v Speaker 1>there'll be another one in 1907 by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

276
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:05.470
<v Speaker 1>and truthfully it looks like an early </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of arms control agreement.</v>

277
00:17:05.881 --> 00:17:07.610
<v Speaker 1>You will see throughout the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

278
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.120
<v Speaker 1>which you can also view through multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>lenses.</v>

279
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:13.550
<v Speaker 1>The first one is you can take it at face</v>
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>

280
00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.490
<v Speaker 1>The way the czar sold it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

281
00:17:16.491 --> 00:17:21.491
<v Speaker 1>if you want to use modern terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the czars pr people when he issues this </v>

282
00:17:21.491 --> 00:17:23.150
<v Speaker 1>invitation to the rest of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders,</v>

283
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couches.</v>

284
00:17:24.201 --> 00:17:28.520
<v Speaker 1>This whole thing as a common sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>effort at a high minded idea.</v>

285
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:30.410
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goal of this conference,</v>

286
00:17:30.411 --> 00:17:35.411
<v Speaker 1>he wants to put together as quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking to make the great idea of </v>

287
00:17:35.411 --> 00:17:37.430
<v Speaker 1>universal peace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>triumph over the elements of trouble and</v>

288
00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:42.431
<v Speaker 1>discord and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might sell an arms control conference</v>

289
00:17:43.421 --> 00:17:46.690
<v Speaker 1>today like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the era where you really see for</v>

290
00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 1>the first time in human history the </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth of what today we would</v>

291
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.980
<v Speaker 5>call the international peace movement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's had many conferences before the </v>

292
00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:59.721
<v Speaker 5>Hague conference to promote these ideas </v>
<v Speaker 5>and there was a general feeling of </v>

293
00:17:59.721 --> 00:18:02.430
<v Speaker 5>progress on these issues and so the czar</v>
<v Speaker 5>may have been playing into that.</v>

294
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:05.190
<v Speaker 5>Although the tsar was kind of an </v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting dude.</v>

295
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:10.220
<v Speaker 5>I'm very much a similar role on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>monarchy dice as the Germans got with </v>

296
00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:13.170
<v Speaker 5>Kaiser Wilhelm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a very mediocre sort of guy,</v>

297
00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:18.171
<v Speaker 5>not the sort of person you could imagine</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever getting this job if it were merit </v>

298
00:18:18.171 --> 00:18:18.540
<v Speaker 5>based.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's the same czar,</v>

299
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.520
<v Speaker 5>the last czar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>

300
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.900
<v Speaker 5>who will fall victim and under sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the sway of the person that is sometimes</v>

301
00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:27.150
<v Speaker 5>called the mad monk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gregory Rasputin.</v>

302
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.710
<v Speaker 5>Although he's more interesting than </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

303
00:18:28.711 --> 00:18:30.030
<v Speaker 5>It probably deserves more credit than </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

304
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:35.360
<v Speaker 5>but it kind of again shows you the Zar </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a kind of an idealistic romantic.</v>

305
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.110
<v Speaker 5>I mean he might have bought into this </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

306
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.090
<v Speaker 5>It might be legitimate on the czar's </v>
<v Speaker 5>part,</v>

307
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:44.930
<v Speaker 5>but like most arms control agreements,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a real politic side to this </v>

308
00:18:45.001 --> 00:18:50.001
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The czar knows that his armies are </v>

309
00:18:50.001 --> 00:18:50.340
<v Speaker 5>falling behind in this technological </v>
<v Speaker 5>race.</v>

310
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:55.460
<v Speaker 5>The old line about arms control </v>
<v Speaker 5>agreements is if you're losing an arms </v>

311
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.340
<v Speaker 5>race,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a good time to have an arms control</v>

312
00:18:56.341 --> 00:19:01.341
<v Speaker 5>agreement and when the powers that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>invited to this Hague conference asked </v>

313
00:19:01.501 --> 00:19:03.750
<v Speaker 5>for clarification of what's on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>agenda,</v>

314
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:08.990
<v Speaker 5>the tsar and his people give them eight </v>
<v Speaker 5>or nine points that are going to be </v>

315
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.201
<v Speaker 5>goals of the conference and the eight or</v>
<v Speaker 5>nine points to a 21st century mind are </v>

316
00:19:12.201 --> 00:19:17.061
<v Speaker 5>fascinating because it really shows you </v>
<v Speaker 5>what the czar wants to come out of this </v>

317
00:19:17.061 --> 00:19:18.540
<v Speaker 5>conference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The is number two goal,</v>

318
00:19:18.541 --> 00:19:21.780
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the agenda gives to the rest of the</v>

319
00:19:21.781 --> 00:19:26.781
<v Speaker 5>participants says quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to prohibit the use in the armies and </v>

320
00:19:26.781 --> 00:19:29.190
<v Speaker 5>fleets of any new kinds of firearms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

321
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.970
<v Speaker 5>and have new explosives or any powders </v>
<v Speaker 5>more powerful than those.</v>

322
00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.920
<v Speaker 5>Now we use either for rifles or Canon </v>
<v Speaker 5>and quote,</v>

323
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:43.380
<v Speaker 5>now this is a staple to some degree of </v>
<v Speaker 5>arms control agreements ever since.</v>

324
00:19:43.381 --> 00:19:48.381
<v Speaker 5>I mean if the US and the Soviet Union or</v>
<v Speaker 5>having an arms control agreement or an </v>

325
00:19:48.381 --> 00:19:49.290
<v Speaker 5>anti ballistic missile agreement or </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

326
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.290
<v Speaker 5>they may have rules on technological </v>
<v Speaker 5>progress,</v>

327
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:56.520
<v Speaker 5>but they aren't trying to stop all </v>
<v Speaker 5>technological progress.</v>

328
00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:01.410
<v Speaker 5>What the czar wants to do is freeze </v>
<v Speaker 5>things where they are.</v>

329
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:07.220
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't want any more research to </v>
<v Speaker 5>increase the killing power that already </v>

330
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.170
<v Speaker 5>exist in militaries.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't want any more deployment.</v>

331
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:15.650
<v Speaker 5>If you accidentally discover that new </v>
<v Speaker 5>battleship gun that will shoot twice as </v>

332
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:16.740
<v Speaker 5>far as your current one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't deploy it.</v>

333
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.890
<v Speaker 5>He wants the size of armies frozen and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then reduced.</v>

334
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.100
<v Speaker 5>He wants the size of military budgets </v>
<v Speaker 5>frozen and then reduced.</v>

335
00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:28.610
<v Speaker 5>This is a person who clearly shows that </v>
<v Speaker 5>his main issue with the way things are </v>

336
00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:34.220
<v Speaker 5>is the pace of change and he wants this </v>
<v Speaker 5>conference to address it now to modern </v>

337
00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:39.891
<v Speaker 5>people who will often freak out if the </v>
<v Speaker 5>promised phone upgrade that's supposed </v>

338
00:20:40.201 --> 00:20:45.201
<v Speaker 5>to be released today is late.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know the Internet will blow up with </v>

339
00:20:45.201 --> 00:20:46.290
<v Speaker 5>angry people who have had their pace of </v>
<v Speaker 5>change sabotaged.</v>

340
00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.280
<v Speaker 5>The people in the late 19th</v>

341
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:53.280
<v Speaker 1>century can probably be forgiven for </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking something we will assume is </v>

342
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.941
<v Speaker 1>impossible is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time I ever encountered this </v>

343
00:20:56.941 --> 00:20:59.530
<v Speaker 1>idea by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was in James Burke's wonderful TV series</v>

344
00:20:59.531 --> 00:21:04.531
<v Speaker 1>from the 19 eighties of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The universe changed where he asked the </v>

345
00:21:04.531 --> 00:21:04.930
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if humankind looks,</v>

346
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:10.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the road we're a particular branch </v>

347
00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.751
<v Speaker 1>of knowledge seems to be taking them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can they decide if they don't like the </v>

348
00:21:12.751 --> 00:21:15.280
<v Speaker 1>destination to just not learn that </v>
<v Speaker 1>branch of knowledge at all or to wall it</v>

349
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:18.640
<v Speaker 1>off so that no one learns it to modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

350
00:21:18.641 --> 00:21:21.670
<v Speaker 1>That sounds impossible to people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>late 19th century.</v>

351
00:21:21.671 --> 00:21:26.671
<v Speaker 1>They would have been able to show you </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple historical examples where that </v>

352
00:21:26.671 --> 00:21:30.241
<v Speaker 1>had been done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Catholic Church was very good at it </v>

353
00:21:30.241 --> 00:21:30.241
<v Speaker 1>in medieval times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

354
00:21:30.241 --> 00:21:31.660
<v Speaker 1>there have been Chinese emperors who </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do it well.</v>

355
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of creating forbidden knowledge</v>

356
00:21:35.231 --> 00:21:40.231
<v Speaker 1>and then preventing people from having </v>
<v Speaker 1>it or using it was not unusual in this </v>

357
00:21:40.231 --> 00:21:41.800
<v Speaker 1>time period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the czar wants.</v>

358
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:47.950
<v Speaker 1>He wants to slow or retard the pace of </v>
<v Speaker 1>change and I always try to remind myself</v>

359
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:54.520
<v Speaker 1>how whipsawed all these people were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this time period by the pace of change </v>

360
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.421
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really what the 19th century is </v>

361
00:21:58.421 --> 00:21:59.840
<v Speaker 1>the era where it all speeds up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could,</v>

362
00:21:59.841 --> 00:22:04.841
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>graph human technological progress the </v>

363
00:22:04.841 --> 00:22:07.850
<v Speaker 1>way you would a stock market performance</v>
<v Speaker 1>graph starting at the beginning of human</v>

364
00:22:07.851 --> 00:22:09.800
<v Speaker 1>history ending yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

365
00:22:09.801 --> 00:22:11.930
<v Speaker 1>and having your ups and downs all </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout history,</v>

366
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.970
<v Speaker 1>you'd noticed a couple of things right </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the bat.</v>

367
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:18.230
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you notice is that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are ups and downs.</v>

368
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:23.770
<v Speaker 1>One thing the modern mind seems to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>incomprehensible is that progress ever </v>

369
00:22:24.201 --> 00:22:28.090
<v Speaker 1>moves backward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who lived in 1900,</v>

370
00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:33.100
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're reading history books that made </v>

371
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:33.380
<v Speaker 1>that sound like a historical law of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

372
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:38.540
<v Speaker 1>They had every reason to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the era they were living in might be the</v>

373
00:22:38.541 --> 00:22:41.990
<v Speaker 1>last of a golden age before a fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because after all,</v>

374
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:45.320
<v Speaker 1>that's what had happened to every other </v>
<v Speaker 1>golden age that they look back on.</v>

375
00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:50.890
<v Speaker 1>The first thing the modern mind sees </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it looks at the historical stock </v>

376
00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:53.240
<v Speaker 1>performance charts showing human </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological progress is that there's a</v>

377
00:22:53.241 --> 00:22:57.230
<v Speaker 1>bunny hop sort of dynamic going on two </v>
<v Speaker 1>steps forward,</v>

378
00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:00.410
<v Speaker 1>one step back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might get a big upturn.</v>

379
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.560
<v Speaker 1>You know when the new kingdom Egyptian </v>
<v Speaker 1>come on the scene,</v>

380
00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.230
<v Speaker 1>maybe another uptake when the Han </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese arrive,</v>

381
00:23:06.231 --> 00:23:08.150
<v Speaker 1>another uptick when the Roman Empire </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrives,</v>

382
00:23:08.151 --> 00:23:11.120
<v Speaker 1>but after your Roman Empire highs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get your Roman Empire bubble,</v>

383
00:23:11.121 --> 00:23:16.121
<v Speaker 1>don't ya?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a couple hundred years later when </v>

384
00:23:16.121 --> 00:23:18.251
<v Speaker 1>it's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have dramatic barbarians and </v>

385
00:23:18.251 --> 00:23:20.681
<v Speaker 1>formerly Roman territory looking up at </v>
<v Speaker 1>crumbling aqua ducks and wondering what </v>

386
00:23:20.681 --> 00:23:24.290
<v Speaker 1>sort of giants once roamed the earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>that could build stuff like that.</v>

387
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:32.240
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing you're gonna notice </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a modern person is the technology </v>

388
00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.571
<v Speaker 1>doesn't always move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second thing you're going to notice </v>

389
00:23:35.571 --> 00:23:38.400
<v Speaker 1>is the throughout most of human history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's going up or going down,</v>

390
00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.460
<v Speaker 1>it's moving at a glacially slow pace.</v>

391
00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 1>The amount of change from the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time too about</v>

392
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:51.160
<v Speaker 5>the renaissance is nowhere near what you</v>
<v Speaker 5>would expect if we were anywhere near </v>

393
00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.271
<v Speaker 5>the pace of change.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have now very little overall growth </v>

394
00:23:55.271 --> 00:23:58.900
<v Speaker 5>until you hit the renaissance and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>you see a little uptick and then the </v>

395
00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:58.900
<v Speaker 5>century after that a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then about 18,</v>

396
00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:03.851
<v Speaker 5>10 slash 1820,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the graph becomes almost vertical </v>

397
00:24:03.851 --> 00:24:07.781
<v Speaker 5>overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It shoots up and instead of ever </v>

398
00:24:07.781 --> 00:24:07.781
<v Speaker 5>plateauing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as we all know,</v>

399
00:24:07.781 --> 00:24:10.880
<v Speaker 5>it goes ever more vertical every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we're used to this because it's been</v>

400
00:24:10.881 --> 00:24:13.670
<v Speaker 5>going that way for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The czars generation.</v>

401
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:14.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that century,</v>

402
00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.470
<v Speaker 5>that's the first time it really takes </v>
<v Speaker 5>off and those people are looking at that</v>

403
00:24:18.471 --> 00:24:23.471
<v Speaker 5>as an extremely destabilizing force.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The czar thinks perhaps an arms control </v>

404
00:24:23.471 --> 00:24:26.390
<v Speaker 5>agreement will help Russia from falling </v>
<v Speaker 5>too far behind.</v>

405
00:24:26.391 --> 00:24:29.360
<v Speaker 5>They're more technologically </v>
<v Speaker 5>sophisticated neighbors now,</v>

406
00:24:29.361 --> 00:24:34.361
<v Speaker 5>as you might expect,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're more technologically </v>

407
00:24:34.361 --> 00:24:36.701
<v Speaker 5>sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Neighbors see this as an artificial </v>

408
00:24:36.701 --> 00:24:36.701
<v Speaker 5>constraint on the fact that they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>winning.</v>

409
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:42.670
<v Speaker 5>Take the Germans as a perfect example of</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are trying very hard to make </v>

410
00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.470
<v Speaker 5>up for what they see as the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>power is treating them like dirt.</v>

411
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:51.790
<v Speaker 5>They're the ones building more ships </v>
<v Speaker 5>than anybody and trying to catch up to </v>

412
00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.521
<v Speaker 5>Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're the ones modernizing their </v>

413
00:24:54.521 --> 00:24:56.321
<v Speaker 5>military every day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're the ones who instead of being </v>

414
00:24:56.321 --> 00:24:58.160
<v Speaker 5>panicked by the pace of change or taking</v>
<v Speaker 5>advantage of it to them,</v>

415
00:24:58.161 --> 00:25:01.430
<v Speaker 5>this looks like an agreement that will </v>
<v Speaker 5>lock in their inferiority,</v>

416
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.760
<v Speaker 5>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a situation that will repeat many</v>

417
00:25:04.761 --> 00:25:07.370
<v Speaker 5>times after this period in arms control </v>
<v Speaker 5>negotiations,</v>

418
00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:12.110
<v Speaker 5>trying to gain an edge on your opponent </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you are losing the arms race,</v>

419
00:25:12.111 --> 00:25:17.111
<v Speaker 5>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>good time to have an arms control </v>

420
00:25:17.111 --> 00:25:17.111
<v Speaker 5>agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Finally,</v>

421
00:25:17.111 --> 00:25:20.780
<v Speaker 5>there's an interesting group of people </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they really don't exist anymore.</v>

422
00:25:20.781 --> 00:25:24.260
<v Speaker 5>Not openly that are on the opposite side</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the ledger from say,</v>

423
00:25:24.261 --> 00:25:26.720
<v Speaker 5>the international peace movement.</v>

424
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.610
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

425
00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:32.620
<v Speaker 5>ramping up during this era.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The people who think that war is a good </v>

426
00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:33.830
<v Speaker 5>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>forget about international,</v>

427
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:39.590
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>goals or real politic people that </v>

428
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:42.131
<v Speaker 5>literally believed that humankind </v>
<v Speaker 5>thrives on war and without war we will </v>

429
00:25:42.131 --> 00:25:46.271
<v Speaker 5>drown in materialism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the only thing that keeps us </v>

430
00:25:46.271 --> 00:25:49.031
<v Speaker 5>focused on the higher things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's an idea that has sort of gone by </v>

431
00:25:49.031 --> 00:25:52.871
<v Speaker 5>the wayside in Western culture today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's peace activists who argue against,</v>

432
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.800
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>real politic people in the 18 eighties </v>

433
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.950
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have guys like the elder Helmut von </v>

434
00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:03.320
<v Speaker 5>Moltke who tries to explain to people </v>
<v Speaker 5>why peace is not even a good idea.</v>

435
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:04.640
<v Speaker 5>You're diluted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

436
00:26:04.641 --> 00:26:09.641
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>perpetual peace is a dream and not even </v>

437
00:26:09.641 --> 00:26:13.181
<v Speaker 5>a beautiful dream,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and war is an integral part of God's </v>

438
00:26:13.181 --> 00:26:13.640
<v Speaker 5>ordering of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In war,</v>

439
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:16.040
<v Speaker 5>man's noblest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Virtues come into play.</v>

440
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:21.190
<v Speaker 5>Courage and renunciation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fidelity to duty and a readiness for </v>

441
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:23.240
<v Speaker 5>sacrifice that does not stop at giving </v>
<v Speaker 5>up life itself.</v>

442
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:28.480
<v Speaker 5>Without war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the world would be swamped in </v>

443
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.851
<v Speaker 5>materialism and to quote others will </v>
<v Speaker 5>point out that if you decide to try to </v>

444
00:26:32.151 --> 00:26:34.520
<v Speaker 5>make war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know a thing of the past.</v>

445
00:26:34.521 --> 00:26:38.060
<v Speaker 5>What happens to all those people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are in situations where you know they're</v>

446
00:26:38.061 --> 00:26:40.340
<v Speaker 5>struggling against four and oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

447
00:26:40.341 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 5>you're going to tell someone they can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>free themselves from a oppressor because</v>

448
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:45.870
<v Speaker 1>you know violence is bad,</v>

449
00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:52.480
<v Speaker 1>but finally you also have the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the modern peace activists would </v>

450
00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.501
<v Speaker 1>recognize very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those who adhere to a belief system that</v>

451
00:26:57.681 --> 00:27:01.820
<v Speaker 1>is difficult to argue with in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know historical proof.</v>

452
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:04.190
<v Speaker 1>You're going to use history as your </v>
<v Speaker 1>guide.</v>

453
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:09.610
<v Speaker 1>You're going to argue that the best way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep the peace is to be so strong </v>

454
00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:12.470
<v Speaker 1>that it is almost suicidal to fight with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

455
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Best exemplified perhaps by British </v>
<v Speaker 1>admiral Sir John Fisher,</v>

456
00:27:17.991 --> 00:27:22.991
<v Speaker 1>who tries to explain to a friend of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when he sounds horrific,</v>

457
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:26.750
<v Speaker 1>he's really an advocate of peace and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

458
00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:27.170
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

459
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.490
<v Speaker 1>I am not for war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am for peace.</v>

460
00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:35.670
<v Speaker 1>That is why I am for Supreme Navy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I not write in your autograph book </v>

461
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.660
<v Speaker 1>at The Hague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the supremacy of the British navy as the</v>

462
00:27:37.661 --> 00:27:39.550
<v Speaker 1>best security for the peace of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>

463
00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:44.820
<v Speaker 1>My sole object is peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you call my truculence is all for </v>

464
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.470
<v Speaker 1>peace if you rub it in both at home and </v>
<v Speaker 1>abroad,</v>

465
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:51.640
<v Speaker 1>that you are ready for instant war with </v>
<v Speaker 1>every unit of your strength in the first</v>

466
00:27:51.641 --> 00:27:56.641
<v Speaker 1>line and waiting to be first in and hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>your enemy in the belly and kick him </v>

467
00:27:56.641 --> 00:27:59.200
<v Speaker 1>when he's down and boil your prisoners </v>
<v Speaker 1>in oil.</v>

468
00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:02.140
<v Speaker 1>If you take any and torture is women and</v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

469
00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:05.350
<v Speaker 1>then people will steer clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>review and quote,</v>

470
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:08.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as harsh as that is,</v>

471
00:28:08.571 --> 00:28:11.990
<v Speaker 1>it has a certain amount of historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence to back it up,</v>

472
00:28:11.991 --> 00:28:15.950
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When asked how to make war more humane,</v>

473
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.090
<v Speaker 1>the nephew of Helmut von Moltke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the elder,</v>

474
00:28:20.091 --> 00:28:25.091
<v Speaker 1>that would be Helmut von Moltke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the younger the field marshal in charge </v>

475
00:28:25.091 --> 00:28:27.170
<v Speaker 1>of Germany's war effort at the start of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first world war famously said,</v>

476
00:28:27.171 --> 00:28:30.080
<v Speaker 1>the only way to make war humane is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it short.</v>

477
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Hence the Schlieffen plan.</v>

478
00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.690
<v Speaker 1>We talked about this so called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schlieffen plan.</v>

479
00:28:37.691 --> 00:28:42.100
<v Speaker 1>In the last episode of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the almost mythological prewar plan</v>

480
00:28:42.101 --> 00:28:44.860
<v Speaker 1>for how Germany was going to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this terrible to front problem.</v>

481
00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:51.040
<v Speaker 1>My analogy is like a bar fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there a meme online that I saw is </v>

482
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.060
<v Speaker 1>comparing world war one to a bar fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a little like,</v>

483
00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:58.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany knows it's going to have a bar </v>

484
00:28:58.260 --> 00:28:58.730
<v Speaker 1>fight with France and Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they know that France is going to be</v>

485
00:28:58.731 --> 00:29:01.550
<v Speaker 1>there five minutes before Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they get to the bar right on time,</v>

486
00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.400
<v Speaker 1>knock France out and five minutes later </v>
<v Speaker 1>when Russia shows up late,</v>

487
00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:06.240
<v Speaker 1>they get to fight the Germans </v>
<v Speaker 1>one-on-one.</v>

488
00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.210
<v Speaker 1>That's the war plan in a nutshell,</v>

489
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:14.570
<v Speaker 1>but the questions surrounding this war </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan have become maybe the number one </v>

490
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:19.431
<v Speaker 1>most controversial issue that historians</v>
<v Speaker 1>argue with each other and froth at the </v>

491
00:29:19.431 --> 00:29:20.850
<v Speaker 1>mouth over and yours truly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

492
00:29:20.851 --> 00:29:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a dog in this fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna sit back,</v>

493
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:28.190
<v Speaker 1>eat popcorn and watch the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>entertaining discussions on the </v>

494
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Schlieffen so called Schlieffen plan </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not just a this or that.</v>

495
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Kennedy assassination thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

496
00:29:34.801 --> 00:29:38.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean every different theory you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of is out there.</v>

497
00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.110
<v Speaker 1>There was a Schlieffen plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

498
00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:41.920
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The schlieffen plan wasn't even planned,</v>

499
00:29:41.921 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

500
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.720
<v Speaker 5>it was modified.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was modified by Mocha.</v>

501
00:29:43.721 --> 00:29:45.200
<v Speaker 5>Then why not call it the Schlieffen </v>
<v Speaker 5>plan?</v>

502
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:50.310
<v Speaker 5>I may just goes on and on and on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the people often on multiple sides </v>

503
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:52.690
<v Speaker 5>of this issue are very credible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I'm not getting.</v>

504
00:29:52.691 --> 00:29:55.570
<v Speaker 5>It's like trying to weigh in on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>discussion with scientists.</v>

505
00:29:55.571 --> 00:29:57.190
<v Speaker 5>You just have to sort of watch </v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes,</v>

506
00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.770
<v Speaker 5>so I'm not going to take a position on </v>
<v Speaker 5>this so culturally even plan,</v>

507
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:04.890
<v Speaker 5>and we'll call it the Schlieffen plan </v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's what everybody knows it </v>

508
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.870
<v Speaker 5>by them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but suffice it to say this shall Ethan's</v>

509
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.090
<v Speaker 5>retired for quite a long time before the</v>
<v Speaker 5>first world war breaks out.</v>

510
00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:15.240
<v Speaker 5>So whatever plan the Germans were going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to use are in the hands of Helmut von </v>

511
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.570
<v Speaker 5>Moltke.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The younger,</v>

512
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.760
<v Speaker 5>the guy who's leading this whole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

513
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:23.790
<v Speaker 5>early war on the Germans part and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>been the one designing this plan for a </v>

514
00:30:23.861 --> 00:30:24.370
<v Speaker 5>long time.</v>

515
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:29.400
<v Speaker 5>After the first world war is over,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you will get a bunch of German generals </v>

516
00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.211
<v Speaker 5>writing memoirs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of castigating this multiple guy </v>

517
00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.210
<v Speaker 5>for deviating from Schlieffen is </v>
<v Speaker 5>amazingly brilliant.</v>

518
00:30:37.211 --> 00:30:42.211
<v Speaker 5>Plan is the way it was pronounced if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you'd just stayed with the plan that </v>

519
00:30:42.211 --> 00:30:42.211
<v Speaker 5>way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was supposed to be,</v>

520
00:30:42.211 --> 00:30:44.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we win the war and so it's worth talking</v>

521
00:30:44.321 --> 00:30:47.920
<v Speaker 5>about the plan a little bit from a </v>
<v Speaker 5>military history standpoint,</v>

522
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.390
<v Speaker 5>the sleep and plan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and again I have to say as it's normally</v>

523
00:30:52.391 --> 00:30:57.391
<v Speaker 5>understood because somebody out there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to have a very good piece of </v>

524
00:30:57.391 --> 00:30:58.540
<v Speaker 5>evidence showing it was totally </v>
<v Speaker 5>different than I'm saying right now,</v>

525
00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.840
<v Speaker 5>but as it's as it's commonly understood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Schlieffen plan is a fantastic </v>

526
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.180
<v Speaker 5>military gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It involves taking troops from basically</v>

527
00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:12.210
<v Speaker 5>everywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might have to fight and taking as </v>

528
00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:13.570
<v Speaker 5>many of them as you can and sticking </v>
<v Speaker 5>them on that one part.</v>

529
00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:18.570
<v Speaker 5>That's going to be the sledge hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The head of the sledgehammer and your </v>

530
00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:22.981
<v Speaker 5>superiority in numbers at the head of </v>
<v Speaker 5>that sledge hammer is going to be so </v>

531
00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:26.221
<v Speaker 5>overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to crush everything and then </v>

532
00:31:26.221 --> 00:31:29.071
<v Speaker 5>you can swing it around and trap all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>French armies that are sitting on the </v>

533
00:31:29.071 --> 00:31:29.720
<v Speaker 5>French border.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

534
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.930
<v Speaker 5>waiting to fight the Germans on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other side of the German border.</v>

535
00:31:31.931 --> 00:31:34.540
<v Speaker 5>But the head of the hammer's coming </v>
<v Speaker 5>through Belgium,</v>

536
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:40.650
<v Speaker 5>a neutral country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to swing from above and then </v>

537
00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:45.331
<v Speaker 5>it's going to collapse down on all those</v>
<v Speaker 5>French armies facing the Germans and </v>

538
00:31:45.331 --> 00:31:48.640
<v Speaker 5>trap them in the rear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a huge gamble.</v>

539
00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:53.970
<v Speaker 5>What if you screw up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What if the Russians mobilized faster </v>

540
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:54.700
<v Speaker 5>than you think they're going to?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

541
00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:59.760
<v Speaker 5>they'll be mowing down your tiny little </v>
<v Speaker 5>forces left there to stop them and </v>

542
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.130
<v Speaker 5>they're not that far from Berlin and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>first territory they're gonna take over,</v>

543
00:32:03.131 --> 00:32:06.610
<v Speaker 5>happens to be the ancestral home of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Prussian nobility,</v>

544
00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:11.760
<v Speaker 5>including Kaiser Wilhelm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so nobody wants to see the Russians </v>

545
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.721
<v Speaker 5>anywhere near Prussia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they happened to be kind of near </v>

546
00:32:15.721 --> 00:32:15.721
<v Speaker 5>Prussia anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's a problem.</v>

547
00:32:15.721 --> 00:32:20.130
<v Speaker 5>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everyone knows the French are going to </v>

548
00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:22.621
<v Speaker 5>want to retake those territories that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Germans took a generation before </v>

549
00:32:22.621 --> 00:32:23.320
<v Speaker 5>which is down at the Franco German </v>
<v Speaker 5>border,</v>

550
00:32:23.321 --> 00:32:25.360
<v Speaker 5>which means the French are gonna attack </v>
<v Speaker 5>there with a lot of forces.</v>

551
00:32:25.361 --> 00:32:27.010
<v Speaker 5>You pull too many people away from </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

552
00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:32.220
<v Speaker 5>The French could be breaking through </v>
<v Speaker 5>into southern Germany while the head of </v>

553
00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:33.600
<v Speaker 5>your sledge hammers still working its </v>
<v Speaker 5>way around French flags.</v>

554
00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:34.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a.</v>

555
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.340
<v Speaker 5>it's a terrible gamble because if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>screw it up,</v>

556
00:32:36.341 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 5>you could lose the war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but let's remember things when she in</v>

557
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.830
<v Speaker 1>is writing the war plan and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly came up with this idea.</v>

558
00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:48.020
<v Speaker 1>The conditions are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The German army is different in size,</v>

559
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:51.500
<v Speaker 1>so was the French army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Russians have almost seen a complete</v>

560
00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:52.820
<v Speaker 1>collapse in 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

561
00:32:52.821 --> 00:32:55.040
<v Speaker 1>five of their whole dynasty mean they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>falling apart.</v>

562
00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:58.430
<v Speaker 1>They just lost a war against Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are no where near as formidable as</v>

563
00:32:58.431 --> 00:32:59.580
<v Speaker 1>they'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

564
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.250
<v Speaker 1>10 years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

565
00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Nine years later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's when von Moltke has to deal </v>

566
00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.131
<v Speaker 1>with things and the situations are </v>
<v Speaker 1>different and he has to recalculate </v>

567
00:33:09.131 --> 00:33:11.660
<v Speaker 1>things and the second part of that whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>equation is sleeping and could afford to</v>

568
00:33:11.661 --> 00:33:15.790
<v Speaker 1>be a gambler because he doesn't actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to do it.</v>

569
00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Schlieffen is a gambler on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mulch is a guy who has to make this work</v>

570
00:33:21.131 --> 00:33:26.131
<v Speaker 1>in real time and not have the downside </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen and live through it and he's more</v>

571
00:33:27.061 --> 00:33:32.061
<v Speaker 1>of a pessimist maybe you would say more </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a realist and he won't put as many </v>

572
00:33:33.541 --> 00:33:38.541
<v Speaker 1>troops in the sledge hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the attack as Schlieffen would </v>

573
00:33:38.541 --> 00:33:38.580
<v Speaker 1>have dictated you should,</v>

574
00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:45.910
<v Speaker 1>he won't denude the other fronts too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is greater degree and leave them that </v>

575
00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:50.621
<v Speaker 1>wide open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can't assume that the war will be </v>

576
00:33:50.621 --> 00:33:54.101
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so automatically that you can just know </v>

577
00:33:54.101 --> 00:33:54.750
<v Speaker 1>that Germany will be safe and won't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>broken through in all these areas you've</v>

578
00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:55.850
<v Speaker 1>denuded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>

579
00:33:55.990 --> 00:34:00.320
<v Speaker 1>mold because a more conservative guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if this plan is true,</v>

580
00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to keep saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>disclaimer,</v>

581
00:34:01.671 --> 00:34:03.650
<v Speaker 1>so don't get in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this plan is true,</v>

582
00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it puts Mocha in a position of accepting</v>

583
00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:09.860
<v Speaker 1>a gamble of a plan for a guy who's not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gambler,</v>

584
00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:12.630
<v Speaker 1>but that's the plan.</v>

585
00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:17.080
<v Speaker 1>And in order to understand the sledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammer side of this plan,</v>

586
00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:22.440
<v Speaker 1>you have to have some sort of conception</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the size of the army's involved for </v>

587
00:34:22.931 --> 00:34:24.580
<v Speaker 1>comparison purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

588
00:34:24.581 --> 00:34:28.750
<v Speaker 1>it sort of demonstrates how much things </v>
<v Speaker 1>have changed in a military sense and how</v>

589
00:34:28.751 --> 00:34:33.751
<v Speaker 1>they've exploded since napoleonic times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at assumptions made by </v>

590
00:34:34.211 --> 00:34:39.211
<v Speaker 1>people who study the Roman Empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the favorite subjects that they </v>

591
00:34:39.211 --> 00:34:42.871
<v Speaker 1>will debate is how many human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>were in the military of the Roman Empire</v>

592
00:34:43.571 --> 00:34:48.220
<v Speaker 1>at its height to police and take care of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that massive ancient state,</v>

593
00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:53.730
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean in any one battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the total military power of the </v>

594
00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Roman Empire at its height,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you will get numbers anywhere from </v>

595
00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.651
<v Speaker 1>450,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>men at the low end and about 750,000</v>

596
00:35:01.691 --> 00:35:06.691
<v Speaker 1>men at the higher end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the numbers of Germans that are </v>

597
00:35:08.351 --> 00:35:13.351
<v Speaker 1>making their way through Belgium in </v>
<v Speaker 1>August 1914 as part of the sledge </v>

598
00:35:14.011 --> 00:35:19.011
<v Speaker 1>hammers head is at least 750,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some numbers put that up to a one point </v>

599
00:35:21.551 --> 00:35:25.530
<v Speaker 1>$2 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that the flanking force,</v>

600
00:35:25.531 --> 00:35:27.510
<v Speaker 1>the head of the sledgehammers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we keep calling it.</v>

601
00:35:27.511 --> 00:35:30.780
<v Speaker 1>That's moving through Belgium to smack </v>
<v Speaker 1>the French like a door.</v>

602
00:35:30.781 --> 00:35:35.781
<v Speaker 1>Swinging on a hinge is at least as large</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the entire military of the Roman </v>

603
00:35:36.241 --> 00:35:41.241
<v Speaker 1>empire at its.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if those lower numbers are actually </v>

604
00:35:41.241 --> 00:35:44.940
<v Speaker 1>closer to the truth for the empires </v>
<v Speaker 1>total military capability,</v>

605
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:49.560
<v Speaker 1>than you might have a German army moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>through Belgium that's twice the size of</v>

606
00:35:49.561 --> 00:35:51.180
<v Speaker 1>the entire Roman empire at its height,</v>

607
00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:57.370
<v Speaker 1>that totally justifies all of the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>fears of these people in the 19th </v>

608
00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:58.340
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worried about this,</v>

609
00:35:58.341 --> 00:36:01.640
<v Speaker 1>to kind of folks who would call a Hague </v>
<v Speaker 1>conference and and write about peace and</v>

610
00:36:01.641 --> 00:36:06.641
<v Speaker 1>all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people who understood what the </v>

611
00:36:06.641 --> 00:36:06.641
<v Speaker 1>growth in the military technology was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do.</v>

612
00:36:06.641 --> 00:36:10.400
<v Speaker 1>I haven't blocks ideas are about to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>proven true in no uncertain fashion.</v>

613
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean these people were used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon,</v>

614
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon's in a giant gamble of invading</v>

615
00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Russia may have had at its highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>750,000</v>

616
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.090
<v Speaker 1>men across the entire front from a giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of Russia.</v>

617
00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:30.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what you have moving through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny little road system and railroad </v>

618
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:33.801
<v Speaker 1>system of Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon's grand army is your flanking </v>

619
00:36:33.961 --> 00:36:35.250
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

620
00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.750
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep trying to remind myself that what</v>

621
00:36:39.751 --> 00:36:44.751
<v Speaker 1>the Germans are trying to do here is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps as much of a of a weird gamble </v>

622
00:36:44.751 --> 00:36:48.831
<v Speaker 1>as you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we also need to remember that most </v>

623
00:36:48.831 --> 00:36:51.531
<v Speaker 1>of the people in the higher leadership </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions in the German military have </v>

624
00:36:51.531 --> 00:36:52.860
<v Speaker 1>done all this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

625
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:58.220
<v Speaker 1>they fought France before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably the most important war </v>

626
00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:01.371
<v Speaker 1>that happened between Napoleon's times </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the first world war and most people </v>

627
00:37:01.371 --> 00:37:02.040
<v Speaker 1>outside of Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

628
00:37:02.041 --> 00:37:04.410
<v Speaker 1>nothing about the Franco Prussian war of</v>
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

629
00:37:04.411 --> 00:37:07.530
<v Speaker 1>78 slash 71,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but essentially forget what it says,</v>

630
00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the history books because it makes it</v>

631
00:37:09.301 --> 00:37:11.550
<v Speaker 1>look like a nine month war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>

632
00:37:11.551 --> 00:37:13.860
<v Speaker 1>The Germans smash the French in a month </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half.</v>

633
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a fantastically interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict and it's shaped the perceptions</v>

634
00:37:18.931 --> 00:37:23.931
<v Speaker 1>and views of these people in the higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership positions because they were </v>

635
00:37:23.931 --> 00:37:24.660
<v Speaker 1>junior officers who fought in that war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

636
00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:32.010
<v Speaker 1>They watched two amazing things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They watched the German army's trap and </v>

637
00:37:33.321 --> 00:37:36.580
<v Speaker 1>entire French army of like 80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90,000</v>

638
00:37:36.581 --> 00:37:39.040
<v Speaker 1>men in one of the French fortresses that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was there to,</v>

639
00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:44.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep the Germans from crossing the </v>

640
00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.721
<v Speaker 1>border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the actual emperor Franz </v>

641
00:37:45.721 --> 00:37:45.721
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy named Napoleon,</v>

642
00:37:45.721 --> 00:37:50.281
<v Speaker 1>the third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another one of those interesting roles </v>

643
00:37:50.281 --> 00:37:50.380
<v Speaker 1>of the monarchy dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leads a relief army.</v>

644
00:37:50.381 --> 00:37:55.381
<v Speaker 1>He's going to break the seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right and rescue his other army of </v>

645
00:37:55.381 --> 00:37:57.961
<v Speaker 1>another 80 or 90,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys and the Germans manage to surround </v>

646
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.620
<v Speaker 1>the whole army with the emperor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forced them to surrender,</v>

647
00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:07.800
<v Speaker 1>which then of course means that entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>army that's also trapped nearby has to </v>

648
00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.861
<v Speaker 1>surrender to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the French fault on for a long </v>

649
00:38:10.861 --> 00:38:10.861
<v Speaker 1>time doggedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

650
00:38:10.861 --> 00:38:12.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people of Paris rose up.</v>

651
00:38:12.341 --> 00:38:17.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a fantastic resistance after </v>

652
00:38:17.341 --> 00:38:19.621
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the war was over in a month and a </v>

653
00:38:19.621 --> 00:38:22.200
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the way the Germans wanted to </v>

654
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:22.200
<v Speaker 1>do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This time.</v>

655
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.010
<v Speaker 1>And the people who did it last time are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones in command of a lot of these </v>

656
00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:28.750
<v Speaker 1>cores and armies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the general staff</v>

657
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:35.470
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the Germans try to make their way </v>

658
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.000
<v Speaker 1>through Belgium and not this important </v>
<v Speaker 1>time schedule screwed up,</v>

659
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:41.230
<v Speaker 1>the French on the other side are trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what the heck's going on.</v>

660
00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Part of what we modern people have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember and I always try to try to put </v>

661
00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.001
<v Speaker 1>myself in their position very hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when we're in an era where the </v>

662
00:38:51.001 --> 00:38:54.241
<v Speaker 1>battlefield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially to western powers and most </v>

663
00:38:54.241 --> 00:38:56.821
<v Speaker 1>especially to the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the battlefield is totally visible for </v>

664
00:38:56.821 --> 00:39:00.121
<v Speaker 1>the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can hide yourself and foliage </v>

665
00:39:00.121 --> 00:39:00.121
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we're nearby.</v>

666
00:39:00.121 --> 00:39:01.330
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have know thermal sensors</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff,</v>

667
00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:06.690
<v Speaker 1>but the battlefield is visible to us now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're used to this in most of human </v>

668
00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:08.950
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fog of war as it's known,</v>

669
00:39:08.951 --> 00:39:13.951
<v Speaker 1>is huge because it keeps you from seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's about to happen until it just is </v>

670
00:39:14.291 --> 00:39:19.291
<v Speaker 1>about to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get a lot of advanced notice </v>

671
00:39:19.291 --> 00:39:19.291
<v Speaker 1>to plan.</v>

672
00:39:19.291 --> 00:39:23.070
<v Speaker 1>That's why aircraft start becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>really important because they take the </v>

673
00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:26.701
<v Speaker 1>eyes of the military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them up in the air and extreme </v>

674
00:39:26.701 --> 00:39:30.780
<v Speaker 1>extend how far back you can see if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see armies moving to another area,</v>

675
00:39:31.391 --> 00:39:32.740
<v Speaker 1>you can safely assume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

676
00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:34.450
<v Speaker 1>I better move my arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to another area.</v>

677
00:39:34.451 --> 00:39:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Something's going to happen over there </v>
<v Speaker 1>during this early part of the battle.</v>

678
00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.660
<v Speaker 1>No one is sure what's happening on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>allied side,</v>

679
00:39:40.661 --> 00:39:45.661
<v Speaker 1>the French or is worried about how they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get the British over here to fight with </v>

680
00:39:45.661 --> 00:39:49.110
<v Speaker 1>as many men as they can bring over as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are about where the Germans come in</v>

681
00:39:49.111 --> 00:39:49.480
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

682
00:39:49.481 --> 00:39:52.690
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in what sort of strength you see the</v>

683
00:39:52.691 --> 00:39:57.691
<v Speaker 1>French have suspected for a very long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time that the Germans were going to do </v>

684
00:39:57.691 --> 00:40:00.460
<v Speaker 1>this outflanking move in Belgium that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was not totally unexpected.</v>

685
00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.990
<v Speaker 1>The part that may have caught them off </v>
<v Speaker 1>guard is what they were out flanking.</v>

686
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:08.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French through Belgium with the guys</v>

687
00:40:08.651 --> 00:40:10.510
<v Speaker 1>running the French military at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

688
00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.720
<v Speaker 1>working on their own war plans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assumptions simply won't believe that </v>

689
00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.310
<v Speaker 1>the size moving through Belgium is as </v>
<v Speaker 1>big as it is.</v>

690
00:40:18.311 --> 00:40:23.311
<v Speaker 1>And let's remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mold guy will be criticized after the </v>

691
00:40:23.311 --> 00:40:23.410
<v Speaker 1>war by other German generals who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>mad.</v>

692
00:40:23.411 --> 00:40:24.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not bigger.</v>

693
00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:26.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

694
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:31.810
<v Speaker 1>the French have huge problems here </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have one of the loosest </v>

695
00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:35.830
<v Speaker 1>agreements I've ever run into in my life</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

696
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>military cooperation there,</v>

697
00:40:38.681 --> 00:40:43.681
<v Speaker 1>battle plans call for the British army </v>
<v Speaker 1>to guard their entire lines.</v>

698
00:40:43.811 --> 00:40:48.811
<v Speaker 1>And when we talk about a line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French military line runs from </v>

699
00:40:48.811 --> 00:40:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland in the south to Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the north,</v>

700
00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:54.370
<v Speaker 1>millions of men in multiple armies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

701
00:40:54.371 --> 00:40:56.560
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of the border,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans had the same thing,</v>

702
00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:00.970
<v Speaker 1>first time in human history that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>had millions of men squaring off against</v>

703
00:41:00.971 --> 00:41:05.971
<v Speaker 1>millions of men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the French left flank is counting on</v>

704
00:41:06.341 --> 00:41:08.890
<v Speaker 1>having the British army there to anchor </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

705
00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:15.060
<v Speaker 1>That agreement has less paperwork </v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to it than you would normally </v>

706
00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.470
<v Speaker 1>generate when you buy a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For all intents and purposes,</v>

707
00:41:17.471 --> 00:41:19.060
<v Speaker 1>as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a handshake deal,</v>

708
00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:23.080
<v Speaker 1>a handshake deal that we will go to war </v>
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>

709
00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:28.081
<v Speaker 1>If war breaks out and a handshake deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with only one government in a country </v>

710
00:41:28.081 --> 00:41:32.251
<v Speaker 1>where governments can come and go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're public opinion isn't unified and a</v>

711
00:41:32.621 --> 00:41:34.190
<v Speaker 1>nation that you've had</v>

712
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:39.250
<v Speaker 5>centuries of antagonistic history with </v>
<v Speaker 5>and only like five or eight years of,</v>

713
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:42.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>friendly cooperation,</v>

714
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:47.770
<v Speaker 5>what's more when Britain gets into this </v>
<v Speaker 5>war and then the first thing that the </v>

715
00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:51.881
<v Speaker 5>British people here is we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>send the troops that would defend us if </v>

716
00:41:51.881 --> 00:41:53.420
<v Speaker 5>the Germans decided to land on our </v>
<v Speaker 5>coastline to France.</v>

717
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:56.330
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of questions over how many</v>
<v Speaker 5>troops despair.</v>

718
00:41:56.450 --> 00:42:01.130
<v Speaker 5>Eventually the BDF we'll get to France </v>
<v Speaker 5>with 70,000</v>

719
00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:06.250
<v Speaker 5>men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>five divisions for infantry.</v>

720
00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:11.360
<v Speaker 5>One cavalry to give you an idea of what </v>
<v Speaker 5>70,000</v>

721
00:42:11.361 --> 00:42:14.030
<v Speaker 5>men are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Five divisions means on this front,</v>

722
00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:19.450
<v Speaker 5>the Germans are deploying like 85 </v>
<v Speaker 5>divisions on the western front.</v>

723
00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.880
<v Speaker 5>70,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>men seems like nothing.</v>

724
00:42:24.881 --> 00:42:26.360
<v Speaker 5>That's the tiny little,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

725
00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.660
<v Speaker 5>it's the army of a sea power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>

726
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:31.780
<v Speaker 5>That's the tiny little force that </v>
<v Speaker 5>bismarck.</v>

727
00:42:31.781 --> 00:42:35.740
<v Speaker 5>A generation before that iron and blood </v>
<v Speaker 5>German diplomat had famously said,</v>

728
00:42:35.741 --> 00:42:37.510
<v Speaker 5>when one of his aids said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if the British land,</v>

729
00:42:37.511 --> 00:42:38.810
<v Speaker 5>their army on our coast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he says that,</v>

730
00:42:38.811 --> 00:42:43.811
<v Speaker 5>then I'll have them arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the army that was so small you </v>

731
00:42:43.811 --> 00:42:45.850
<v Speaker 5>could joke about arresting them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but here's the difference.</v>

732
00:42:45.851 --> 00:42:49.840
<v Speaker 5>Unlike all the other major armies of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>participants in this war,</v>

733
00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:55.590
<v Speaker 5>the British army or professional long </v>
<v Speaker 5>standing regular force with a lot of </v>

734
00:42:58.301 --> 00:43:03.301
<v Speaker 5>people in the specialty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the noncommissioned officer ranks who </v>

735
00:43:03.301 --> 00:43:06.601
<v Speaker 5>were lifers and who when this war </v>
<v Speaker 5>started immediately called up there </v>

736
00:43:06.601 --> 00:43:09.160
<v Speaker 5>reservists guys who served 10,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15,</v>

737
00:43:09.161 --> 00:43:14.161
<v Speaker 5>20 years before and had fought in places</v>
<v Speaker 5>like South Africa and the Boer War and </v>

738
00:43:14.161 --> 00:43:18.751
<v Speaker 5>the turn of the century.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The institutional memory of these units </v>

739
00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:23.710
<v Speaker 5>was deep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The quality of these forces was intense.</v>

740
00:43:23.711 --> 00:43:25.010
<v Speaker 5>They used to have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

741
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:29.650
<v Speaker 5>unlimited marksman practice and get </v>
<v Speaker 5>financial rewards for winning it.</v>

742
00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.040
<v Speaker 5>They'd actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

743
00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:36.060
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the people in these units </v>
<v Speaker 5>fought in actual combat with modern </v>

744
00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:36.060
<v Speaker 5>weapons.</v>

745
00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:40.090
<v Speaker 5>My favorite source from this early </v>
<v Speaker 5>period is an Irishman.</v>

746
00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:41.740
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as you might imagine,</v>

747
00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:45.100
<v Speaker 5>a WHO's actually fighting in the BDF,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his name is John Lucy,</v>

748
00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:48.720
<v Speaker 5>and he's one of the few British side </v>
<v Speaker 5>reporters,</v>

749
00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:53.820
<v Speaker 5>I guess you could call him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's a soldier who writes from this </v>

750
00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:56.260
<v Speaker 5>very early period because he was right </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the first wave and he explains,</v>

751
00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:01.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the difference between his unit and the </v>

752
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:02.630
<v Speaker 5>rest of the continental troops and he </v>
<v Speaker 5>does so in a very chauvinist stick,</v>

753
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:06.610
<v Speaker 5>a very proud fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he claims quote,</v>

754
00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:11.950
<v Speaker 5>the British army in 1914 was more used </v>
<v Speaker 5>to battle than that of any other nation.</v>

755
00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:17.220
<v Speaker 5>It possessed the highest and bravest </v>
<v Speaker 5>traditions that can be engendered in a </v>

756
00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:21.151
<v Speaker 5>fighting force and its experience of </v>
<v Speaker 5>wars was such that our own regiment </v>

757
00:44:21.151 --> 00:44:24.160
<v Speaker 5>though a young one in the army,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had so many battle honors that they were</v>

758
00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:29.161
<v Speaker 5>difficult to memorize and quote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now John Lewis is only 20.</v>

759
00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:32.490
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't have a long service history </v>
<v Speaker 5>under his belt,</v>

760
00:44:32.491 --> 00:44:37.491
<v Speaker 5>but when the reservists arrive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he watches men who appear to be just </v>

761
00:44:37.491 --> 00:44:42.141
<v Speaker 5>regular folks off the street,</v>
<v Speaker 5>transformed themselves into grizzled </v>

762
00:44:42.141 --> 00:44:43.110
<v Speaker 5>British veterans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Quote</v>

763
00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.700
<v Speaker 5>are reservists came streaming into </v>
<v Speaker 5>makeup,</v>

764
00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:50.440
<v Speaker 5>our war strength,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cheerful careless fellows of all types,</v>

765
00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:53.230
<v Speaker 5>some in bowler hats and smart suiting </v>
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

766
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:58.360
<v Speaker 5>others in descending scale down to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>garb of tramps soon like us.</v>

767
00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:01.210
<v Speaker 5>They were uniformed and equipped with </v>
<v Speaker 5>field kits,</v>

768
00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:06.360
<v Speaker 5>and the change was remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Smart Sergeants and corporals and beer </v>

769
00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:09.830
<v Speaker 5>ribbon veterans of the South African war</v>
<v Speaker 5>hatched out of that crowd of nondescript</v>

770
00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:14.230
<v Speaker 5>civilians and took their place in duties</v>
<v Speaker 5>as if they had never left the army.</v>

771
00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:17.670
<v Speaker 5>They were an excellent lot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but their numbers increased our strength</v>

772
00:45:17.671 --> 00:45:22.671
<v Speaker 5>to an uncomfortable extent and quote </v>
<v Speaker 5>what John Lucy found to be an </v>

773
00:45:23.051 --> 00:45:28.051
<v Speaker 5>uncomfortable increasing of numbers when</v>
<v Speaker 5>they arrived at the continent.</v>

774
00:45:28.401 --> 00:45:31.240
<v Speaker 5>Seemed like a tiny little trickle of </v>
<v Speaker 5>British soldiers,</v>

775
00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:36.990
<v Speaker 5>but the quality of this army that came </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be known as the old contemptible was </v>

776
00:45:37.121 --> 00:45:40.630
<v Speaker 5>of the highest level matching the top </v>
<v Speaker 5>German units.</v>

777
00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:47.050
<v Speaker 5>It was ironically under the command of a</v>
<v Speaker 5>British general name,</v>

778
00:45:47.051 --> 00:45:52.051
<v Speaker 5>French,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who didn't very much like the French Sir</v>

779
00:45:52.421 --> 00:45:54.660
<v Speaker 5>John French will lead the B,</v>
<v Speaker 5>e,</v>

780
00:45:54.661 --> 00:45:59.661
<v Speaker 5>f the British expeditionary force onto </v>
<v Speaker 5>the continent just in time to play their</v>

781
00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:05.491
<v Speaker 5>historic role in what Sir Arthur Conan </v>
<v Speaker 5>doyle called the most terrible August in</v>

782
00:46:06.611 --> 00:46:08.020
<v Speaker 5>the history of the world.</v>

783
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:15.080
<v Speaker 5>There'll be involved in several battles </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are all called the battle of the </v>

784
00:46:16.681 --> 00:46:21.681
<v Speaker 5>frontiers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a bunch of little battles that </v>

785
00:46:21.681 --> 00:46:23.691
<v Speaker 5>are all sort of wrapped up into this one</v>
<v Speaker 5>big event called the battle of the </v>

786
00:46:23.691 --> 00:46:25.310
<v Speaker 5>frontiers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What it really means is,</v>

787
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:28.620
<v Speaker 5>is all the fighting that was going on </v>
<v Speaker 5>along this front,</v>

788
00:46:28.621 --> 00:46:33.120
<v Speaker 5>and there are several sort of thrusts </v>
<v Speaker 5>and Perry's encounter thrust that go on.</v>

789
00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:39.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to spend a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 5>time than I normally plan to for the </v>

790
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:39.420
<v Speaker 5>rest of this series on this battle </v>
<v Speaker 5>because this,</v>

791
00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:44.930
<v Speaker 5>this battle of the frontiers is in so </v>
<v Speaker 5>many ways the most interesting moment of</v>

792
00:46:45.991 --> 00:46:47.820
<v Speaker 5>this war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

793
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:50.520
<v Speaker 5>it's what we've talked about for an </v>
<v Speaker 5>episode and a half.</v>

794
00:46:50.521 --> 00:46:53.160
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the rubber meets the road moment,</v>

795
00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:58.310
<v Speaker 5>the testing moment for all this military</v>
<v Speaker 5>theory and hypothesis that's been </v>

796
00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:00.110
<v Speaker 5>happening in some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

797
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:05.120
<v Speaker 5>for the last hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get to see if people's assumptions </v>

798
00:47:06.161 --> 00:47:10.000
<v Speaker 5>about how this weapon system would work </v>
<v Speaker 5>or that tactic would fare.</v>

799
00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:13.840
<v Speaker 5>You get to see which of those turn out </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be correct and which ones don't,</v>

800
00:47:14.350 --> 00:47:19.350
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of the time these armies will </v>
<v Speaker 5>go into combat hamstrung by decisions </v>

801
00:47:20.171 --> 00:47:25.171
<v Speaker 5>that were made a decade before in terms </v>
<v Speaker 5>of what the army's doctrine's going to </v>

802
00:47:25.171 --> 00:47:26.260
<v Speaker 5>be or the tactics or how they're going </v>
<v Speaker 5>to be.</v>

803
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.730
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dressed and equipped.</v>

804
00:47:27.731 --> 00:47:28.750
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take the French.</v>

805
00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 5>The French will go</v>

806
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:35.100
<v Speaker 1>into this modern war and it is almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to understand this today </v>

807
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:39.700
<v Speaker 1>because there's a ludicrousness to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shows off another century.</v>

808
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.810
<v Speaker 1>You want to see the 19th century clash </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the 20th century.</v>

809
00:47:43.811 --> 00:47:45.850
<v Speaker 1>It happens in this battle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frontiers.</v>

810
00:47:45.851 --> 00:47:47.320
<v Speaker 1>In August 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>

811
00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:50.800
<v Speaker 1>the French go into combat with almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>the exact same uniform.</v>

812
00:47:50.890 --> 00:47:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Their grandfathers war in 1870,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a blue jacket with tails wide red pants </v>

813
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:05.190
<v Speaker 1>that look like targets and acted like it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their officers would have white hats </v>

814
00:48:07.661 --> 00:48:09.310
<v Speaker 1>and white gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean again,</v>

815
00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:14.340
<v Speaker 1>targets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will send cavalry to go fight that </v>

816
00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:18.721
<v Speaker 1>look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can go look at your history </v>

817
00:48:18.721 --> 00:48:18.790
<v Speaker 1>books in 1914 and they often have </v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures of this cavalry.</v>

818
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.310
<v Speaker 1>I told my friend who was always asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

819
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:26.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see a picture of </v>

820
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon's queer sears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

821
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.580
<v Speaker 1>his famous cavalry with the breast </v>
<v Speaker 1>plates in the horse hair,</v>

822
00:48:27.581 --> 00:48:28.930
<v Speaker 1>plumed helmets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

823
00:48:28.931 --> 00:48:30.460
<v Speaker 1>when the sabres and the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

824
00:48:30.461 --> 00:48:33.790
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to wish for a picture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon's queers ears.</v>

825
00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:38.800
<v Speaker 1>They're going off to war in 1914.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look identical armor and all.</v>

826
00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:46.310
<v Speaker 1>That's the old world going off to war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can see it visually.</v>

827
00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:51.320
<v Speaker 1>Think of how the French soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 1>hamstrung by that.</v>

828
00:48:51.770 --> 00:48:54.400
<v Speaker 1>The British had been using khaki,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

829
00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:58.760
<v Speaker 1>for themselves since the colonial wars </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 18 eighties.</v>

830
00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:03.850
<v Speaker 1>The French are going to go into this war</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking like walking.</v>

831
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Peacocks and a ton of French soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 1>will pay the price for that.</v>

832
00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:12.040
<v Speaker 1>They'll pay the price for not having </v>
<v Speaker 1>much in the way of heavy artillery to.</v>

833
00:49:12.041 --> 00:49:17.041
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these were all ideas that you could </v>

834
00:49:17.041 --> 00:49:19.501
<v Speaker 1>logically back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The French decided they wanted to have </v>

835
00:49:19.501 --> 00:49:19.501
<v Speaker 1>more mobile army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we don't need that big,</v>

836
00:49:19.501 --> 00:49:19.780
<v Speaker 1>heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cumbersome,</v>

837
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:22.840
<v Speaker 1>slow artillery to slow us down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time that gets anywhere,</v>

838
00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:25.090
<v Speaker 1>the battle's going to be over anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds great.</v>

839
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:30.600
<v Speaker 1>In theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you try it and you find out your </v>

840
00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.451
<v Speaker 1>soldiers are in terrible trouble on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual battlefields because they don't </v>

841
00:49:33.451 --> 00:49:33.451
<v Speaker 1>have any heavy artillery.</v>

842
00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:37.680
<v Speaker 1>There's a reputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The French have militarily in the United</v>

843
00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:41.910
<v Speaker 1>States that is in ordinance influenced </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way the Second World War went.</v>

844
00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:47.240
<v Speaker 1>I always try to tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you misunderstand Francis military </v>

845
00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:50.661
<v Speaker 1>reputation then because for hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years they're considered one of the </v>

846
00:49:50.661 --> 00:49:52.590
<v Speaker 1>finest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not the finest land army in the world</v>

847
00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:57.690
<v Speaker 1>100 years before this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little coarser can guy is using,</v>

848
00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:00.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially as the hardcore of his armies</v>

849
00:50:00.271 --> 00:50:05.271
<v Speaker 1>to conquer the majority of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that mattered at this time and the one </v>

850
00:50:05.271 --> 00:50:09.591
<v Speaker 1>that owned the rest of the majority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is colonies and did it with </v>

851
00:50:09.591 --> 00:50:09.990
<v Speaker 1>French troops.</v>

852
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:16.550
<v Speaker 1>They will often heroically throw their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives down to try to overcome these </v>

853
00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:21.261
<v Speaker 1>deficiencies that they enter war width.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you could make a case that in </v>

854
00:50:21.261 --> 00:50:23.250
<v Speaker 1>all three wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that over 75 years,</v>

855
00:50:23.251 --> 00:50:26.760
<v Speaker 1>the French and Germans fought with each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other from 1870 to 1945,</v>

856
00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:32.060
<v Speaker 1>that the average French soldier on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground was hamstrung by his leadership </v>

857
00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:33.890
<v Speaker 1>in all three of those conflicts in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Second World War.</v>

858
00:50:33.891 --> 00:50:35.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean historically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tragically,</v>

859
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:42.760
<v Speaker 1>but I would suggest that the war out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those three in which French leadership </v>

860
00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.510
<v Speaker 1>performed the best was in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>world war.</v>

861
00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:49.990
<v Speaker 1>There are a bunch of different generals </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think Second World War France </v>

862
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.180
<v Speaker 1>would have given their right arm to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

863
00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:54.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>led by a guy who is iconic.</v>

864
00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:57.860
<v Speaker 1>I've always thought of him as like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French Churchill,</v>

865
00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:03.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Churchill was to Britain in the </v>

866
00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy is to France in the first world</v>

867
00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:07.031
<v Speaker 1>war and he has all these same </v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypically interesting anecdotes </v>

868
00:51:07.031 --> 00:51:08.690
<v Speaker 1>and characteristics that Churchill had.</v>

869
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:13.690
<v Speaker 1>But instead of them being </v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypically British as Churchill's </v>

870
00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:14.810
<v Speaker 1>were their stereotypical Golic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're French.</v>

871
00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:20.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill had this thing with alcohol </v>

872
00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:21.110
<v Speaker 1>that was part of his image and part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fun with this guy.</v>

873
00:51:21.111 --> 00:51:26.111
<v Speaker 1>It's food and that's because it fits </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly with his physical sort of </v>

874
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:28.970
<v Speaker 1>image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's huge in every way.</v>

875
00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:31.640
<v Speaker 1>He's tall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fat.</v>

876
00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:36.820
<v Speaker 1>He's got a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bushy white mustache and a placid look </v>

877
00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:37.470
<v Speaker 1>on his face all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name is Joseph.</v>

878
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:40.940
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if I mispronounced that again,</v>

879
00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:42.320
<v Speaker 1>that's just going to be the first of </v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

880
00:51:42.321 --> 00:51:44.600
<v Speaker 1>my apologies because he still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

881
00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:47.300
<v Speaker 1>the lion of France in a lot of French </v>
<v Speaker 1>households.</v>

882
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:50.480
<v Speaker 1>He's a fabulously interesting guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

883
00:51:50.481 --> 00:51:54.410
<v Speaker 1>I've read a significant amount on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>person and I'm not sure I understand him</v>

884
00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:57.170
<v Speaker 1>any better than before I started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's more,</v>

885
00:51:57.171 --> 00:51:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure these authors did either.</v>

886
00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:03.270
<v Speaker 1>He is like an obelisk and he is </v>
<v Speaker 1>imperturbably.</v>

887
00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Good luck scratching the surface of </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out what you have there.</v>

888
00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:08.960
<v Speaker 1>And even his contemporaries felt that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

889
00:52:08.961 --> 00:52:13.961
<v Speaker 1>One thing when you read quotes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who knew him say about him is </v>

890
00:52:13.961 --> 00:52:13.961
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

891
00:52:13.961 --> 00:52:17.970
<v Speaker 1>they say different things sometimes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sometimes they didn't know what this </v>

892
00:52:18.591 --> 00:52:19.820
<v Speaker 1>guy was up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

893
00:52:20.110 --> 00:52:25.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you look at something and you </v>

894
00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:25.110
<v Speaker 1>wonder if he's just a little doll or </v>
<v Speaker 1>slow or receive,</v>

895
00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:29.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sly like a Fox and just hiding </v>

896
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.190
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

897
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.190
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an interesting guy.</v>

898
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:33.611
<v Speaker 1>You could probe this guy a long time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>still not really get a good idea about </v>

899
00:52:33.611 --> 00:52:38.261
<v Speaker 1>what you're dealing with here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one thing you can say about him is </v>

900
00:52:38.261 --> 00:52:42.070
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got one of those qualities of </v>

901
00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:43.931
<v Speaker 1>generalship that's just going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect match for what's needed at the </v>

902
00:52:43.931 --> 00:52:43.931
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

903
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:49.210
<v Speaker 1>And I've always said that you general </v>
<v Speaker 1>generalship is absolutely an art and in </v>

904
00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:49.370
<v Speaker 1>the same way that art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

905
00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:54.390
<v Speaker 1>sees the manifestation of the artist's </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality sort of translated in its </v>

906
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:57.890
<v Speaker 1>own unique way in the art form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generalship is like that too.</v>

907
00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:03.760
<v Speaker 1>You can see all these different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>generals who all have these different </v>

908
00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.060
<v Speaker 1>kinds of personalities and they command </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

909
00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:09.560
<v Speaker 1>And the key is to try to find your </v>
<v Speaker 1>strengths and then you know,</v>

910
00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:12.500
<v Speaker 1>figuring out a way to make those </v>
<v Speaker 1>strengths work for you on a battlefield.</v>

911
00:53:12.501 --> 00:53:15.560
<v Speaker 1>Take for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these really aggressive commanders,</v>

912
00:53:15.561 --> 00:53:17.540
<v Speaker 1>these quick thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard pushing,</v>

913
00:53:17.541 --> 00:53:22.541
<v Speaker 1>dashing sort of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hind Scuderia in the famous guy who </v>

914
00:53:22.541 --> 00:53:25.770
<v Speaker 1>basically created the German tank </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach in the World War.</v>

915
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.780
<v Speaker 1>He was that kind of guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Guy,</v>

916
00:53:27.781 --> 00:53:31.290
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's commanding the most important army</v>

917
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.960
<v Speaker 1>on the German side in this war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sledge Hammer,</v>

918
00:53:33.961 --> 00:53:37.410
<v Speaker 1>head army first army's a guy just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this too hard driving,</v>

919
00:53:37.411 --> 00:53:38.760
<v Speaker 1>aggressive kind of guy.</v>

920
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:43.110
<v Speaker 1>That sort of approach is perfect in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>situations and in some armies.</v>

921
00:53:43.111 --> 00:53:45.780
<v Speaker 1>But then you need the bean counter guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes too.</v>

922
00:53:46.110 --> 00:53:47.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what von Moltke is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a bean counter.</v>

923
00:53:47.941 --> 00:53:52.941
<v Speaker 1>He sits there and and plans everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>out to the nth degree and make sure all </v>

924
00:53:52.941 --> 00:53:54.370
<v Speaker 1>the t's are crossed and the i's dotted </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have anything,</v>

925
00:53:54.371 --> 00:53:57.570
<v Speaker 1>and those guys are very useful to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspirational general,</v>

926
00:53:57.571 --> 00:54:02.571
<v Speaker 1>like an Alexander the great who get out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and get your troops to perform </v>

927
00:54:02.571 --> 00:54:06.030
<v Speaker 1>feats of heroism that may be a lesser </v>
<v Speaker 1>man or a woman couldn't have gotten them</v>

928
00:54:06.031 --> 00:54:11.031
<v Speaker 1>to perform this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all these different kinds of </v>

929
00:54:11.031 --> 00:54:13.251
<v Speaker 1>generals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer is the kind that doesn't ever </v>

930
00:54:13.251 --> 00:54:14.700
<v Speaker 1>get ruffled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he brings to the table.</v>

931
00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:20.900
<v Speaker 1>He refuses to panic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's almost frightfully calm in </v>

932
00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.710
<v Speaker 1>situations that he's about to experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

933
00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:26.250
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are not only stressful to the point</v>

934
00:54:26.251 --> 00:54:31.251
<v Speaker 1>of panic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the perhaps panic is the right </v>

935
00:54:31.251 --> 00:54:31.251
<v Speaker 1>emotion to have.</v>

936
00:54:31.251 --> 00:54:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are historians out there who </v>

937
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.640
<v Speaker 1>suggested that we should not look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as such a great quality to bring to</v>

938
00:54:35.641 --> 00:54:40.641
<v Speaker 1>the table because it might be Jennifer's</v>
<v Speaker 1>own shortcomings in some of the other </v>

939
00:54:40.831 --> 00:54:45.831
<v Speaker 1>arts of generalship that made it </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary for there to be a guy who </v>

940
00:54:45.831 --> 00:54:49.521
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't panic at the top to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't be needing to panic if you'd </v>

941
00:54:49.521 --> 00:54:53.561
<v Speaker 1>have been a better player of that blind </v>
<v Speaker 1>chess game that we talked about earlier </v>

942
00:54:53.561 --> 00:54:54.060
<v Speaker 1>and maybe offer is not that good at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

943
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Hence the situation becomes panic </v>
<v Speaker 1>inducing.</v>

944
00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Hence a leader that's very good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopping.</v>

945
00:54:59.431 --> 00:55:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Panic is just what you need at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

946
00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.500
<v Speaker 1>might be a self reinforcing sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

947
00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:09.800
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's hard to deny that </v>
<v Speaker 1>France would have given up a right arm </v>

948
00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:13.521
<v Speaker 1>and both legs to have this guy in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second world war and the reason that </v>

949
00:55:13.521 --> 00:55:18.141
<v Speaker 1>this guy is going to be so necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>this imperturbability is going to be so </v>

950
00:55:18.141 --> 00:55:21.381
<v Speaker 1>necessary is because of how this first </v>
<v Speaker 1>round in this heavyweight championship </v>

951
00:55:21.381 --> 00:55:23.760
<v Speaker 1>fight that's gonna go on for four years </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to go.</v>

952
00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:26.400
<v Speaker 1>And if you're going to use a boxing </v>
<v Speaker 1>analogy here for this,</v>

953
00:55:26.401 --> 00:55:30.630
<v Speaker 1>this is gonna be a boring fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the fight goes on,</v>

954
00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:35.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're things slow down to a dull roar </v>

955
00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:35.780
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's looking for tactical </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities and,</v>

956
00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:39.810
<v Speaker 1>and but the first round is wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massive haymakers swings.</v>

957
00:55:39.811 --> 00:55:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Mrs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropping the other guy for,</v>

958
00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:42.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an eight count.</v>

959
00:55:42.601 --> 00:55:47.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a wild first round and </v>

960
00:55:47.601 --> 00:55:48.090
<v Speaker 1>if you lose your head you could lose the</v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

961
00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:53.300
<v Speaker 1>So having Jennifer at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the French high command shows that </v>

962
00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:53.300
<v Speaker 1>the French are not going to lose their </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

963
00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I can't help but think about the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>commander at this point though.</v>

964
00:55:58.350 --> 00:56:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Von Moltke [inaudible] a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting guy in the sense that he </v>

965
00:56:03.350 --> 00:56:04.770
<v Speaker 1>almost looks like a guy who doesn't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be there.</v>

966
00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:10.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is the nephew of one of the greatest </v>

967
00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:10.460
<v Speaker 1>heroes in German military history.</v>

968
00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:12.720
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like he went into the family</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

969
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:16.530
<v Speaker 1>but whereas those guys thought about </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but war all the time.</v>

970
00:56:16.531 --> 00:56:21.531
<v Speaker 1>And remember Schlieffen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the legendary writer of the Schlieffen </v>

971
00:56:21.531 --> 00:56:24.711
<v Speaker 1>plan is supposed to have died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still saying stuff about the Schlieffen </v>

972
00:56:24.711 --> 00:56:28.771
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last words on his lips are </v>

973
00:56:28.771 --> 00:56:28.771
<v Speaker 1>supposedly make sure to keep the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>wing strong.</v>

974
00:56:28.771 --> 00:56:33.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are people who have no hobbies </v>

975
00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:35.940
<v Speaker 1>other than war von Moltke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The younger is a guy who famously said </v>

976
00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:39.400
<v Speaker 1>that art was what he lived for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think about this guy in the most,</v>

977
00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:41.950
<v Speaker 1>one of the most stressful positions in </v>
<v Speaker 1>all history.</v>

978
00:56:41.951 --> 00:56:46.951
<v Speaker 1>Once this war breaks out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember he has no illusions about what </v>

979
00:56:46.951 --> 00:56:51.481
<v Speaker 1>the stakes are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the one who famously said that the </v>

980
00:56:51.481 --> 00:56:54.481
<v Speaker 1>war that he's launching will decide the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course of history for the next hundred </v>

981
00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.110
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it certainly has.</v>

982
00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Think of the pressure on that though.</v>

983
00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Think about the fact that his plan that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's operating with is a terrible </v>

984
00:57:03.330 --> 00:57:06.991
<v Speaker 1>gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then watch how every flip of the </v>

985
00:57:06.991 --> 00:57:09.220
<v Speaker 1>coin so far in this conflict has gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>against him.</v>

986
00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:14.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're judging this fight based on </v>

987
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:17.400
<v Speaker 1>who landed the latest punch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>von Moltke and the Germans are losing </v>

988
00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:20.530
<v Speaker 1>right from the very beginning when </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the Conan flips that have</v>

989
00:57:20.531 --> 00:57:22.030
<v Speaker 1>already happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

990
00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:25.360
<v Speaker 1>think about the Belgium one to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

991
00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were hoping that when you invaded </v>

992
00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:32.881
<v Speaker 1>Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just sort of stood by the side of </v>

993
00:57:32.881 --> 00:57:33.700
<v Speaker 1>the road and let you go through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would feed you and everything,</v>

994
00:57:33.701 --> 00:57:34.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would.</v>

995
00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:37.690
<v Speaker 1>That's what your hope was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could have been a flip of the coin.</v>

996
00:57:37.691 --> 00:57:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Belgians resisted you.</v>

997
00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:43.540
<v Speaker 1>They destroyed the communication and </v>
<v Speaker 1>transportation system you were hoping to</v>

998
00:57:43.541 --> 00:57:46.510
<v Speaker 1>use and then to make matters worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them were shooting at you,</v>

999
00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:51.660
<v Speaker 1>allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your troops had been executing </v>

1000
00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:54.121
<v Speaker 1>Belgians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes you look terrible on the </v>

1001
00:57:54.121 --> 00:57:54.121
<v Speaker 1>world stage.</v>

1002
00:57:54.121 --> 00:57:55.750
<v Speaker 1>So that coin flipped the wrong way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you flip the coin again.</v>

1003
00:57:55.751 --> 00:57:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Britain won't get involved when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>violate,</v>

1004
00:57:58.210 --> 00:57:59.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the neutrality of Belgium,</v>

1005
00:57:59.711 --> 00:58:01.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a scrap of paper.</v>

1006
00:58:01.091 --> 00:58:02.860
<v Speaker 1>As the German diplomat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous Luke said,</v>

1007
00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:08.460
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that landed on the wrong side of the </v>

1008
00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:08.460
<v Speaker 1>coin to the British came in and you lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>that flip.</v>

1009
00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Another flip happens starting on August </v>
<v Speaker 1>15th and the timetables going to get </v>

1010
00:58:13.751 --> 00:58:18.751
<v Speaker 1>weird now because there's stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening on multiple fronts that </v>

1011
00:58:18.751 --> 00:58:19.630
<v Speaker 1>overlap with each other because while </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going on,</v>

1012
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:24.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first maneuvers are going on in the </v>

1013
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:24.990
<v Speaker 1>West do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1014
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:27.830
<v Speaker 1>but on the 15th of August,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're on multiple watching how your </v>

1015
00:58:27.830 --> 00:58:27.880
<v Speaker 1>planned attack is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going,</v>

1016
00:58:27.881 --> 00:58:31.510
<v Speaker 1>and you haven't even gotten your sledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammer head through Belgium yet.</v>

1017
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:34.540
<v Speaker 1>So you're still a ways away from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack doing anything,</v>

1018
00:58:34.810 --> 00:58:37.090
<v Speaker 1>but you've got things starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapse around you.</v>

1019
00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:42.480
<v Speaker 1>On August 15th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Serbs remembered this as a moderate </v>

1020
00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:44.010
<v Speaker 1>country fighting a great power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1021
00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:48.340
<v Speaker 1>some Serbian gunman killed the Austrian </v>
<v Speaker 1>archduke and that's why we're here,</v>

1022
00:58:48.341 --> 00:58:49.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1023
00:58:49.331 --> 00:58:54.331
<v Speaker 1>the one thing everyone was sure about is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that no matter what happens in this </v>

1024
00:58:54.331 --> 00:58:54.331
<v Speaker 1>conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serbia is going to get their butt kicked</v>

1025
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.990
<v Speaker 1>because they're fighting Austria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungary,</v>

1026
00:58:55.991 --> 00:58:58.420
<v Speaker 1>who is right next door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're a global power.</v>

1027
00:58:58.570 --> 00:59:03.570
<v Speaker 1>The austro-hungarian are camped out sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of on a hillside by a river on the 15th </v>

1028
00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:04.920
<v Speaker 1>of August.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred and 80,000</v>

1029
00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:05.890
<v Speaker 1>serves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Attack them.</v>

1030
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:09.370
<v Speaker 1>The Austria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian army has about 200,000</v>

1031
00:59:09.371 --> 00:59:13.240
<v Speaker 1>people and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's morale just collapses.</v>

1032
00:59:13.241 --> 00:59:18.241
<v Speaker 1>And we told you before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Serbs are one of those people </v>

1033
00:59:18.241 --> 00:59:20.860
<v Speaker 1>historically who in the military sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of punch above their weight class.</v>

1034
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:24.290
<v Speaker 1>They're ferocious fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were aggressive,</v>

1035
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:29.530
<v Speaker 1>aggressively lead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Austro-hungarian forces were </v>

1036
00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:30.950
<v Speaker 1>apparently more riddled with problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>than anyone knew.</v>

1037
00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:35.060
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of them will drown routing </v>
<v Speaker 1>across this river,</v>

1038
00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:38.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursued closely by 180,000</v>

1039
00:59:38.490 --> 00:59:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Serbians in three armies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about what this does if you're von</v>

1040
00:59:43.311 --> 00:59:48.311
<v Speaker 1>Moltke in terms of stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're hoping that the ostrow </v>

1041
00:59:48.311 --> 00:59:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Hungarians can help you keep the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians off your neck until you're done</v>

1042
00:59:52.101 --> 00:59:53.030
<v Speaker 1>in France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

1043
00:59:53.050 --> 00:59:54.980
<v Speaker 1>you've got to deal with enemies on each </v>
<v Speaker 1>side here.</v>

1044
00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:58.220
<v Speaker 1>You're hoping your ally right there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to help.</v>

1045
00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:03.460
<v Speaker 1>And yet they just got their tailed </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked by a moderate size power.</v>

1046
01:00:04.281 --> 01:00:06.620
<v Speaker 1>What's going to happen when they face </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians?</v>

1047
01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:13.100
<v Speaker 1>And then on the 17th of August,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest disaster at all,</v>

1048
01:00:15.061 --> 01:00:19.920
<v Speaker 1>if you're von Moltke occurs and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians arrive early,</v>

1049
01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.680
<v Speaker 1>talk about flipping the coin before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

1050
01:00:22.681 --> 01:00:27.681
<v Speaker 1>assuming you can get all this stuff done</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the Russians mobilized and then </v>

1051
01:00:27.681 --> 01:00:31.050
<v Speaker 1>they mobilize early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by August 17th,</v>

1052
01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:33.850
<v Speaker 1>von [inaudible] has problems everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1053
01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:38.860
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it becomes a real question whether </v>

1054
01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:41.211
<v Speaker 1>or not he's ever going to be able to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>his war winning sledge hammer because </v>

1055
01:00:41.401 --> 01:00:44.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe he'll have lost the war everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>else before that even happens.</v>

1056
01:00:44.221 --> 01:00:45.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's writings you can,</v>

1057
01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:47.790
<v Speaker 1>you can read from this time period in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1914.</v>

1058
01:00:47.791 --> 01:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>They think that the war is almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>already over.</v>

1059
01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the 14th of August,</v>

1060
01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer and the French launch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack into Alsace Lorraine,</v>

1061
01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:59.530
<v Speaker 1>the first real attack I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1062
01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:01.930
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sent it token force in there on the</v>

1063
01:01:01.931 --> 01:01:03.460
<v Speaker 1>seventh of August.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1064
01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:04.240
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1065
01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:09.410
<v Speaker 1>you gotta remember seventh of August is </v>
<v Speaker 1>four days after France and Germany </v>

1066
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:10.210
<v Speaker 1>declared war on each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They send a token force in there,</v>

1067
01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:12.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with messages from the French leadership</v>

1068
01:01:12.701 --> 01:01:13.330
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1069
01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.490
<v Speaker 1>here we're home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're back in the bosom of France.</v>

1070
01:01:15.491 --> 01:01:16.720
<v Speaker 1>All these wonderful things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kisses,</v>

1071
01:01:16.721 --> 01:01:18.280
<v Speaker 1>picnic baskets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flowers,</v>

1072
01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:19.570
<v Speaker 1>wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole deal,</v>

1073
01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:21.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcomed with open arms.</v>

1074
01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:26.340
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden that little </v>
<v Speaker 1>token for us with the roses and wine and</v>

1075
01:01:26.411 --> 01:01:31.411
<v Speaker 1>everything has to run back across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French border because the German force </v>

1076
01:01:31.411 --> 01:01:33.490
<v Speaker 1>that's nearby is not a token force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on August 14th,</v>

1077
01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:37.480
<v Speaker 1>the day before the Serbs smash that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Austro-hungarian Army,</v>

1078
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:39.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that so discomforts,</v>

1079
01:01:39.641 --> 01:01:41.260
<v Speaker 1>von Moltke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French,</v>

1080
01:01:41.261 --> 01:01:43.480
<v Speaker 1>launched two armies into Alsace </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lorraine.</v>

1081
01:01:43.481 --> 01:01:45.430
<v Speaker 1>And it's serious now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's on,</v>

1082
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:50.910
<v Speaker 1>now we have to have the best armies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world clashing head on with </v>

1083
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:53.950
<v Speaker 1>significant numbers of people and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French push the Germans back</v>

1084
01:01:55.150 --> 01:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>and then the next day they push them </v>
<v Speaker 1>back again and then the next day they </v>

1085
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:03.461
<v Speaker 1>push them back again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it should be noted that while the </v>

1086
01:02:03.531 --> 01:02:08.531
<v Speaker 1>rest of the world thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this looks like just one more disaster </v>

1087
01:02:08.531 --> 01:02:09.590
<v Speaker 1>for Germany side and you have all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>other problems,</v>

1088
01:02:09.591 --> 01:02:12.200
<v Speaker 1>the Russians are already in east Prussia</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now look at the French.</v>

1089
01:02:12.201 --> 01:02:13.910
<v Speaker 1>The first time they launch a significant</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>

1090
01:02:13.911 --> 01:02:18.080
<v Speaker 1>The Germans are backing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's one thing I'm sure von Moltke</v>

1091
01:02:18.081 --> 01:02:23.081
<v Speaker 1>wasn't stressed about because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>retreat by the Germans was all part of </v>

1092
01:02:23.081 --> 01:02:27.860
<v Speaker 1>the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Germans of course,</v>

1093
01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:31.890
<v Speaker 1>for decades knew that the French would </v>
<v Speaker 1>involve Alsace.</v>

1094
01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Lorraine in any war effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they put troops there who had </v>

1095
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:40.061
<v Speaker 1>orders to retire to just sort of keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>the French engaged,</v>

1096
01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:44.450
<v Speaker 1>but move backwards as they move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let them even into Germany,</v>

1097
01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:50.430
<v Speaker 1>shoot them as they're pursuing you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take your toll on them as they're </v>

1098
01:02:50.711 --> 01:02:52.600
<v Speaker 1>pursuing you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but retire in good order.</v>

1099
01:02:52.601 --> 01:02:57.580
<v Speaker 1>Take your guns with you and just sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull them away from all the parts of the</v>

1100
01:02:57.581 --> 01:03:02.581
<v Speaker 1>war that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see when the French figure out about</v>

1101
01:03:02.811 --> 01:03:07.811
<v Speaker 1>this sledgehammer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've also compared it to a door on a </v>

1102
01:03:07.811 --> 01:03:10.331
<v Speaker 1>hinge because you have all these German </v>
<v Speaker 1>armies stretching from the Swiss border </v>

1103
01:03:10.331 --> 01:03:14.260
<v Speaker 1>all the way up to Belgium and most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them are just there to keep the French </v>

1104
01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:15.530
<v Speaker 1>occupied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The damage that's going to be done.</v>

1105
01:03:15.531 --> 01:03:20.531
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be done by that door sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of in Belgium and Luxembourg that swings</v>

1106
01:03:21.351 --> 01:03:23.450
<v Speaker 1>closed on top of the French nation.</v>

1107
01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:29.490
<v Speaker 1>The other German army's job is to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>the French in front of them occupied so </v>

1108
01:03:29.490 --> 01:03:33.391
<v Speaker 1>they can't turn around and move in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different direction and do anything </v>

1109
01:03:33.391 --> 01:03:36.991
<v Speaker 1>about that hammer and those French </v>
<v Speaker 1>army's way down south in Alsace and </v>

1110
01:03:36.991 --> 01:03:40.741
<v Speaker 1>Lorraine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are down by the Swiss border that </v>

1111
01:03:40.741 --> 01:03:40.741
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1112
01:03:40.741 --> 01:03:43.440
<v Speaker 1>pursuing German armies back into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>interior of Germany are just getting </v>

1113
01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.760
<v Speaker 1>farther and farther away from where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can help.</v>

1114
01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Once the French realize they need every </v>
<v Speaker 1>army they can get their hands on to deal</v>

1115
01:03:50.111 --> 01:03:55.111
<v Speaker 1>with that threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fond [inaudible] not upset about </v>

1116
01:03:55.111 --> 01:03:56.530
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is part of the deal and that starts</v>

1117
01:03:56.531 --> 01:03:58.540
<v Speaker 1>on August 14th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15th,</v>

1118
01:03:58.541 --> 01:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>16th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17th.</v>

1119
01:03:59.591 --> 01:04:02.260
<v Speaker 1>That continues there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Russians are in east Prussia now.</v>

1120
01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:06.430
<v Speaker 1>The Austrians have been defeated on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their front since the seventh of August,</v>

1121
01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>but really big on the 11th and twelfth </v>
<v Speaker 1>of August.</v>

1122
01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:14.010
<v Speaker 1>The British Expeditionary Force has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>arriving on the continent and they keep </v>

1123
01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:15.700
<v Speaker 1>saying they're not going to be ready to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight until maybe the 26th of August,</v>

1124
01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:18.430
<v Speaker 1>but the French would like them there </v>
<v Speaker 1>sooner.</v>

1125
01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:23.910
<v Speaker 1>One Frenchmen in particular is desperate</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have the British show up as early as </v>

1126
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:27.961
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the French general who was </v>

1127
01:04:27.961 --> 01:04:29.200
<v Speaker 1>commanding the army on Francis left </v>
<v Speaker 1>flank,</v>

1128
01:04:29.590 --> 01:04:31.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last army,</v>

1129
01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:33.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's kind of facing.</v>

1130
01:04:33.521 --> 01:04:36.160
<v Speaker 1>So to Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where if you look to your right,</v>

1131
01:04:36.161 --> 01:04:41.161
<v Speaker 1>they've got several armies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of men all the way down to the </v>

1132
01:04:41.161 --> 01:04:45.061
<v Speaker 1>Swiss border,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally protected from anybody </v>

1133
01:04:45.061 --> 01:04:45.061
<v Speaker 1>penetrating our ranks and hitting us in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the flank.</v>

1134
01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:47.500
<v Speaker 1>But if that fifth army under a general </v>
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>

1135
01:04:47.501 --> 01:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Lynn Rasic looks to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks north,</v>

1136
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>there's nobody there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's open land,</v>

1137
01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:59.910
<v Speaker 1>there's maneuvering room for an enemy to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get around his flanks and destroy him </v>

1138
01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:04.561
<v Speaker 1>and roll the whole French line up all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way down to Switzerland if </v>

1139
01:05:04.561 --> 01:05:07.681
<v Speaker 1>necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's got a vested interest in being </v>

1140
01:05:07.681 --> 01:05:11.671
<v Speaker 1>aware of any potential threats out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's going to take it in the </v>

1141
01:05:11.671 --> 01:05:11.671
<v Speaker 1>flank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1142
01:05:11.671 --> 01:05:16.201
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it shows up and he perceives even </v>

1143
01:05:16.201 --> 01:05:18.391
<v Speaker 1>before the war starts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's sending messages in July to </v>

1144
01:05:18.391 --> 01:05:22.651
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer saying going all signs point to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a German advanced through Belgium </v>

1145
01:05:22.651 --> 01:05:26.761
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one reason you knew the high </v>

1146
01:05:26.761 --> 01:05:26.761
<v Speaker 1>command knew about it.</v>

1147
01:05:26.761 --> 01:05:27.820
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody knew how big it was going to be,</v>

1148
01:05:27.821 --> 01:05:32.821
<v Speaker 1>but this general and resit keeps telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>them every couple of days he's sending </v>

1149
01:05:32.821 --> 01:05:33.760
<v Speaker 1>messages to the high command going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1150
01:05:33.761 --> 01:05:36.570
<v Speaker 1>latest reports are or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge attack.</v>

1151
01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:39.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean he basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Way History will vindicate this guy,</v>

1152
01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:45.060
<v Speaker 1>is he correctly perceived the power and </v>
<v Speaker 1>destination of this German blow long </v>

1153
01:05:46.451 --> 01:05:51.451
<v Speaker 1>before anyone else does and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical what ifs in this time period </v>

1154
01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.680
<v Speaker 1>is what if Jennifer had taken what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was saying?</v>

1155
01:05:53.681 --> 01:05:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sooner again,</v>

1156
01:05:55.811 --> 01:05:58.660
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't need to be such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful,</v>

1157
01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:03.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stability factor when panic is all </v>

1158
01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.931
<v Speaker 1>around you if you don't make a mistake </v>
<v Speaker 1>like not listening to this general in </v>

1159
01:06:06.931 --> 01:06:08.530
<v Speaker 1>which creates the panic inducing </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation to begin with.</v>

1160
01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Gioffre basically thinks the guy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>panicking and then he starts saying,</v>

1161
01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:15.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it becomes apparent that something is</v>

1162
01:06:15.411 --> 01:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>moving through Belgium and those forts </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going down,</v>

1163
01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:21.530
<v Speaker 1>he starts thinking this is going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing for the same reason.</v>

1164
01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:26.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a good thing for the Germans to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have those French go through Alsace </v>

1165
01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Lorraine and keep advancing away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the action's going to be.</v>

1166
01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.040
<v Speaker 1>A offers ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1167
01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:33.290
<v Speaker 1>even if the Germans are going through </v>
<v Speaker 1>Belgium with a large force,</v>

1168
01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:38.680
<v Speaker 1>all the better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our plans going to be to cut that large </v>

1169
01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:39.890
<v Speaker 1>force off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this is a swinging gate or door,</v>

1170
01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:45.010
<v Speaker 1>we will hit it at the hinge and then we </v>
<v Speaker 1>will roll up behind it all the way up to</v>

1171
01:06:45.291 --> 01:06:46.400
<v Speaker 1>the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1172
01:06:46.401 --> 01:06:51.401
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the North Sea or the English Channel </v>

1173
01:06:51.401 --> 01:06:51.401
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then your cutoff.</v>

1174
01:06:51.401 --> 01:06:54.800
<v Speaker 1>And then this wonderful sledge hammer </v>
<v Speaker 1>blow becomes a surrounded,</v>

1175
01:06:54.801 --> 01:06:59.801
<v Speaker 1>trapped cream of your army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he turned a negative into a positive </v>

1176
01:06:59.801 --> 01:07:03.080
<v Speaker 1>and basically would tell len rasic that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have nothing to worry about.</v>

1177
01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:08.900
<v Speaker 1>One resnick thought different and </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured his chances would be improved if</v>

1178
01:07:08.901 --> 01:07:13.901
<v Speaker 1>that British force would hurry up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up on his left so that even though </v>

1179
01:07:13.901 --> 01:07:15.830
<v Speaker 1>the British might have an open left </v>
<v Speaker 1>flank,</v>

1180
01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:20.831
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't have one anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's at that point that the battle </v>

1181
01:07:21.171 --> 01:07:22.730
<v Speaker 1>of the frontiers breaks out.</v>

1182
01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Now the battle of the frontiers is named</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because it's the time where the </v>

1183
01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.650
<v Speaker 1>general eruption of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1184
01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:38.690
<v Speaker 1>on the Franco German border happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are a lot of different </v>

1185
01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:42.390
<v Speaker 1>encounters that are all a part of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger conflict essentially though is an</v>

1186
01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:46.200
<v Speaker 1>umbrella term that covers all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence on the Franco German border.</v>

1187
01:07:46.201 --> 01:07:48.150
<v Speaker 1>That breaks out almost simultaneously.</v>

1188
01:07:50.290 --> 01:07:55.290
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out to be a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>important thing for the German war </v>

1189
01:07:55.290 --> 01:07:56.440
<v Speaker 1>effort that it did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

1190
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:58.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by about August 19th,</v>

1191
01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:02.110
<v Speaker 1>the German situation really is bad as we</v>
<v Speaker 1>said earlier.</v>

1192
01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:07.130
<v Speaker 1>But things I've even gotten worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those Russians in East Prussia that had </v>

1193
01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:10.321
<v Speaker 1>shown up sooner than expected had </v>
<v Speaker 1>defeated some German forces that went </v>

1194
01:08:10.321 --> 01:08:11.670
<v Speaker 1>out and tried to deal with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden it looks like that flank</v>

1195
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:16.710
<v Speaker 1>might be collapsing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get really excited about </v>

1196
01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:16.940
<v Speaker 1>anything if you're Molko whose nickname </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1197
01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:20.570
<v Speaker 1>given to him by the Kaiser was something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that translates loosely,</v>

1198
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:22.580
<v Speaker 1>too gloomy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gus.</v>

1199
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:25.130
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly an optimist.</v>

1200
01:08:25.131 --> 01:08:30.131
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't have been feeling too good </v>

1201
01:08:30.131 --> 01:08:30.131
<v Speaker 1>about the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the 19th or 20th,</v>

1202
01:08:30.131 --> 01:08:33.650
<v Speaker 1>he receives a request from one of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>generals in the field.</v>

1203
01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:37.580
<v Speaker 1>It's the guy who is retreating from all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those French forces,</v>

1204
01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:42.581
<v Speaker 1>retiring in good order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking his guns with them and sort of </v>

1205
01:08:42.581 --> 01:08:42.581
<v Speaker 1>drawing them away from the action.</v>

1206
01:08:42.581 --> 01:08:44.660
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the wonderful German royalty</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of this.</v>

1207
01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:47.480
<v Speaker 1>This isn't in the Wehrmacht.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the Second World War,</v>

1208
01:08:47.481 --> 01:08:50.060
<v Speaker 1>you didn't have any of this and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>first where you have all these guys like</v>

1209
01:08:50.330 --> 01:08:53.120
<v Speaker 1>Prince Rupert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prick of Bavaria,</v>

1210
01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.570
<v Speaker 1>and he commands the forest that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>retreating.</v>

1211
01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.880
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't like retreating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1212
01:08:58.881 --> 01:09:00.890
<v Speaker 1>you don't get a lot of metals for </v>
<v Speaker 1>retreating.</v>

1213
01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly what he was hoping to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do with an army in this war,</v>

1214
01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:08.510
<v Speaker 1>so we requests to von Moltke can I </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack now?</v>

1215
01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:11.060
<v Speaker 1>This goes against the idea of what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do,</v>

1216
01:09:11.061 --> 01:09:16.061
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the retreat or he pulls his French </v>

1217
01:09:16.061 --> 01:09:16.061
<v Speaker 1>force away from where the hammer is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to hit,</v>

1218
01:09:16.061 --> 01:09:19.760
<v Speaker 1>but he makes a pretty good case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These French are asking for it.</v>

1219
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:24.890
<v Speaker 1>They're sitting ducks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have been sort of like getting more</v>

1220
01:09:24.891 --> 01:09:29.891
<v Speaker 1>and more disordered and strung out after</v>
<v Speaker 1>days of pursuing us and we'd been </v>

1221
01:09:29.891 --> 01:09:31.640
<v Speaker 1>shooting them with artillery and </v>
<v Speaker 1>weakening them.</v>

1222
01:09:31.790 --> 01:09:34.880
<v Speaker 1>They are ripe for a counter attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will crush them,</v>

1223
01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:41.050
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of several incidents </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will happen literally in the next </v>

1224
01:09:41.050 --> 01:09:45.520
<v Speaker 1>few days that some historians have </v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed to for years as the moment when </v>

1225
01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:45.520
<v Speaker 1>the Germans lost the war.</v>

1226
01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:51.700
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some historians say that mold because </v>

1227
01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.630
<v Speaker 1>responds to Crown Prince Rubric Dot </v>
<v Speaker 1>Riveria last him the war.</v>

1228
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:58.400
<v Speaker 1>He told group raked that he could </v>
<v Speaker 1>counter attack.</v>

1229
01:09:58.401 --> 01:10:02.480
<v Speaker 1>The French were strung out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorganized and asking for it,</v>

1230
01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:07.400
<v Speaker 1>and on August 20th he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He crushes them.</v>

1231
01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the time where you get to see </v>

1232
01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:19.160
<v Speaker 1>perhaps from a soldier's perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that had changed battle and </v>

1233
01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:23.721
<v Speaker 1>warfare the most really coming into its </v>
<v Speaker 1>own machine guns made a huge difference.</v>

1234
01:10:24.361 --> 01:10:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Make no mistake about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there were a lot of things that seem</v>

1235
01:10:26.731 --> 01:10:30.180
<v Speaker 1>relatively benign when you look at them </v>
<v Speaker 1>that made huge differences too,</v>

1236
01:10:30.181 --> 01:10:35.181
<v Speaker 1>like barbed wire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the element that technology in land </v>

1237
01:10:35.181 --> 01:10:39.711
<v Speaker 1>warfare had altered the most in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that would change the face of </v>

1238
01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:45.111
<v Speaker 1>warfare and how it was fought and </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced by human beings on the </v>

1239
01:10:45.111 --> 01:10:48.291
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Artillery had come leaps and bounds </v>

1240
01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:53.510
<v Speaker 1>beyond anything anyone had expected and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's artillery that on August 20th hits </v>

1241
01:10:53.971 --> 01:10:58.971
<v Speaker 1>the French when they're still in tight </v>
<v Speaker 1>columns marching and mustering and just </v>

1242
01:11:01.021 --> 01:11:02.850
<v Speaker 1>sitting around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean later in the war,</v>

1243
01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Ernst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young or German soldier will write about</v>

1244
01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:08.280
<v Speaker 1>the effect on a shell.</v>

1245
01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:12.120
<v Speaker 1>One single artillery shell landing in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of people that were just,</v>

1246
01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:17.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting around a town square 150 of his </v>

1247
01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:18.150
<v Speaker 1>soldier comrades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

1248
01:11:18.151 --> 01:11:20.370
<v Speaker 1>the one shell killed 70 of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>outright.</v>

1249
01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine if you're in March column or</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're gathered around a a mess,</v>

1250
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:31.070
<v Speaker 1>a senator or a taking a religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>service in,</v>

1251
01:11:31.771 --> 01:11:36.771
<v Speaker 1>in the field or whatever when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>closely matched with your buddies and </v>

1252
01:11:36.771 --> 01:11:40.251
<v Speaker 1>then modern artillery hits you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember part of this is the technology </v>

1253
01:11:40.251 --> 01:11:45.111
<v Speaker 1>of the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other part of it is the science and </v>

1254
01:11:45.111 --> 01:11:45.111
<v Speaker 1>engineering that goes into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1255
01:11:45.111 --> 01:11:47.880
<v Speaker 1>making artillery effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just shooting the gun up in the air,</v>

1256
01:11:47.881 --> 01:11:50.910
<v Speaker 1>but you should see the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientific calculations,</v>

1257
01:11:50.911 --> 01:11:55.911
<v Speaker 1>these soldiers on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the mathematics they had to do to </v>

1258
01:11:55.911 --> 01:11:58.461
<v Speaker 1>make sure that everything was honed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right way and everything and that </v>

1259
01:11:58.461 --> 01:12:00.630
<v Speaker 1>really differentiated by the way the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good armies from the less good armies.</v>

1260
01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:03.990
<v Speaker 1>The Russians had a ton of artillery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have good engineering people</v>

1261
01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:09.020
<v Speaker 1>shooting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was often inaccurate and not </v>

1262
01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:11.031
<v Speaker 1>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The British and the French and the </v>

1263
01:12:11.031 --> 01:12:12.741
<v Speaker 1>Germans had exceptional people working </v>
<v Speaker 1>their artillery and it was very </v>

1264
01:12:12.741 --> 01:12:15.780
<v Speaker 1>effective and the German artillery was </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger and better than anything that the</v>

1265
01:12:15.781 --> 01:12:20.781
<v Speaker 1>French had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where they find out that that </v>

1266
01:12:20.781 --> 01:12:22.911
<v Speaker 1>idea of that light mobile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>75 millimeter artillery getting the job </v>

1267
01:12:22.911 --> 01:12:24.360
<v Speaker 1>done in every situation was horribly </v>
<v Speaker 1>flawed.</v>

1268
01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:27.570
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was outraged by the German pieces.</v>

1269
01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:30.630
<v Speaker 1>The Germans could hit it when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't hit the Germans.</v>

1270
01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:36.260
<v Speaker 1>When the German army under Crown Prince </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rupert hits the French in a counter </v>

1271
01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:38.940
<v Speaker 1>attack on August 20th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the artillery just devastates them.</v>

1272
01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:43.130
<v Speaker 1>As historian Eric burroughs writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

1273
01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:48.570
<v Speaker 1>the first furious fighting occurred in </v>
<v Speaker 1>southern Lorraine were the French second</v>

1274
01:12:48.571 --> 01:12:53.571
<v Speaker 1>army having progressed 35 kilometers was</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit at Marangu by the German army,</v>

1275
01:12:54.001 --> 01:12:59.001
<v Speaker 1>the counterattack with superior </v>
<v Speaker 1>artillery fire from 105 millimeter and </v>

1276
01:12:59.001 --> 01:13:00.450
<v Speaker 1>150 millimeter howitzers.</v>

1277
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:05.750
<v Speaker 1>The barrage crushed second army </v>
<v Speaker 1>formations that we're assembling in </v>

1278
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:09.351
<v Speaker 1>tight ranks for the day is March,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forcing it to flee and thereby </v>

1279
01:13:09.351 --> 01:13:11.610
<v Speaker 1>compelling and exposed first army to </v>
<v Speaker 1>retreat as well.</v>

1280
01:13:12.150 --> 01:13:17.150
<v Speaker 1>End Quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what Bros is talking about there is </v>

1281
01:13:17.150 --> 01:13:19.740
<v Speaker 1>that when the Germans crushed the French</v>
<v Speaker 1>second army and it has to retreat,</v>

1282
01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:25.340
<v Speaker 1>it creates a hole in the line and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most dangerous thing for any of </v>

1283
01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:30.051
<v Speaker 1>these armies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to main maintain an unbroken </v>

1284
01:13:30.051 --> 01:13:32.010
<v Speaker 1>line because if there are places that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be penetrated by enemy forces,</v>

1285
01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:37.250
<v Speaker 1>those forces can move into those gaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if they turn right or turn </v>

1286
01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:41.541
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're hitting another army in the </v>

1287
01:13:41.541 --> 01:13:43.551
<v Speaker 1>flank where it's terribly vulnerable or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could continue to go deeper into </v>

1288
01:13:43.551 --> 01:13:46.770
<v Speaker 1>the interior and strike at logistics and</v>
<v Speaker 1>supply and rear areas.</v>

1289
01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole point is don't allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1290
01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:54.860
<v Speaker 1>a gap to open up in your line and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you can to create or exploit,</v>

1291
01:13:55.750 --> 01:14:00.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your enemy doing something like that </v>

1292
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:00.750
<v Speaker 1>with their forces.</v>

1293
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:03.870
<v Speaker 1>So when second army gets smashed and has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to retreat backwards,</v>

1294
01:14:03.871 --> 01:14:08.871
<v Speaker 1>first army has to go with them just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that the line stays unbroken </v>

1295
01:14:08.871 --> 01:14:12.831
<v Speaker 1>and nobody can get into our interior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a lot of different things </v>

1296
01:14:13.271 --> 01:14:16.360
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to draw a conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>wise from what happened,</v>

1297
01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:21.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Alsace and lorraine were those two </v>

1298
01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.230
<v Speaker 1>armies were hit by the Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gioffre decided that this allowed him to</v>

1299
01:14:23.231 --> 01:14:26.440
<v Speaker 1>see where the Germans were weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we mentioned earlier,</v>

1300
01:14:26.441 --> 01:14:28.450
<v Speaker 1>this is about playing chess without </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing,</v>

1301
01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:30.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the other guys pieces are.</v>

1302
01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Part of what [inaudible] offers got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do as a commander is some detective </v>

1303
01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:39.451
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a rough idea how many forces the </v>

1304
01:14:39.451 --> 01:14:39.610
<v Speaker 1>Germans have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he can identify,</v>

1305
01:14:39.810 --> 01:14:41.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where those forces are,</v>

1306
01:14:41.501 --> 01:14:43.600
<v Speaker 1>he can start to figure out where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest are.</v>

1307
01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:48.820
<v Speaker 1>He figures if he's getting so hammered </v>
<v Speaker 1>down in the south on August 20th,</v>

1308
01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:52.660
<v Speaker 1>and if he believes that general on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>flank,</v>

1309
01:14:52.661 --> 01:14:57.661
<v Speaker 1>the fifth army general that keeps </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling him the Germans are making a </v>

1310
01:14:57.661 --> 01:14:59.380
<v Speaker 1>major effort through Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are all those troops coming from?</v>

1311
01:14:59.710 --> 01:15:01.870
<v Speaker 1>They have to be pulled from somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You offer.</v>

1312
01:15:01.871 --> 01:15:06.871
<v Speaker 1>Figured the Germans are weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that point he decided that they had </v>

1313
01:15:06.871 --> 01:15:10.110
<v Speaker 1>been pulled from the German center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's strong down in Alsace.</v>

1314
01:15:10.111 --> 01:15:15.111
<v Speaker 1>Lorraine by Switzerland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're strong up in Belgium where </v>

1315
01:15:15.111 --> 01:15:15.111
<v Speaker 1>they've knocked down those sports in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1316
01:15:15.111 --> 01:15:16.210
<v Speaker 1>They're coming at us like a door on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hinge,</v>

1317
01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:21.270
<v Speaker 1>so they're weak in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shot for made a major mistake here and </v>

1318
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:24.100
<v Speaker 1>the major mistake was assuming the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans would treat their reserve forces</v>

1319
01:15:24.101 --> 01:15:27.400
<v Speaker 1>the same way the French did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reserve forces are those forces that</v>

1320
01:15:27.401 --> 01:15:32.401
<v Speaker 1>are not as competent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as highly trained as the regular </v>

1321
01:15:32.401 --> 01:15:34.891
<v Speaker 1>military forces and the French practice </v>
<v Speaker 1>with those forces was to keep them in </v>

1322
01:15:34.891 --> 01:15:35.230
<v Speaker 1>the reserve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1323
01:15:35.231 --> 01:15:37.040
<v Speaker 1>keep them back away from the action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1324
01:15:37.041 --> 01:15:39.970
<v Speaker 1>use them to support people when you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>more troops thrown in,</v>

1325
01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:45.210
<v Speaker 1>but don't put them anywhere vulnerable </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you could lose the war with </v>

1326
01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:45.210
<v Speaker 1>inexperienced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1327
01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:46.660
<v Speaker 1>not up to standard troops like that.</v>

1328
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:52.110
<v Speaker 1>The Germans totally integrated their </v>
<v Speaker 1>reserves into their armies and it </v>

1329
01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:55.291
<v Speaker 1>planned for this for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were using all their reserves so </v>

1330
01:15:55.721 --> 01:15:59.200
<v Speaker 1>they had greater numbers actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in all these combats.</v>

1331
01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Then Jennifer's estimations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this will cost him dearly when he </v>

1332
01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:09.181
<v Speaker 1>attacks the center of the German line in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the battle of the frontiers on August </v>

1333
01:16:09.181 --> 01:16:10.030
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first 22nd.</v>

1334
01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:16.200
<v Speaker 1>And the center is a weird area because </v>
<v Speaker 1>if the left is up by Belgium and the </v>

1335
01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:16.570
<v Speaker 1>right is down by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1336
01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Alsace Lorraine and Switzerland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The center is the part where the terrain</v>

1337
01:16:20.111 --> 01:16:21.530
<v Speaker 1>is hard to fight in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1338
01:16:21.531 --> 01:16:26.531
<v Speaker 1>the giant Ardin forest is there and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hilly terrain with not a lot of roads,</v>

1339
01:16:26.921 --> 01:16:28.600
<v Speaker 1>difficult country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1340
01:16:28.601 --> 01:16:32.200
<v Speaker 1>It's the same country that everyone was </v>
<v Speaker 1>so shocked when the Germans came through</v>

1341
01:16:32.201 --> 01:16:37.201
<v Speaker 1>it with tanks in the second world war </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was thought to be </v>

1342
01:16:37.201 --> 01:16:37.201
<v Speaker 1>impenetrable.</v>

1343
01:16:37.201 --> 01:16:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first world war,</v>

1344
01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:41.020
<v Speaker 1>that's where the Shatford decides to </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack because he's determined that they</v>

1345
01:16:41.021 --> 01:16:42.520
<v Speaker 1>must.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Germans must be weak there.</v>

1346
01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:48.120
<v Speaker 1>What's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how he's going to deal now with </v>

1347
01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.180
<v Speaker 1>this sledgehammer issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it really exists,</v>

1348
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:54.270
<v Speaker 1>he's going to cut it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to launch his attack at the </v>

1349
01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:57.211
<v Speaker 1>German center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right where that hinge point is with a </v>

1350
01:16:57.211 --> 01:16:59.821
<v Speaker 1>door swings between the forces of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans that move and the forces of the </v>

1351
01:16:59.821 --> 01:17:04.501
<v Speaker 1>Germans that stay stationary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There should be a gap smashed through </v>

1352
01:17:04.501 --> 01:17:04.501
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get behind them,</v>

1353
01:17:04.570 --> 01:17:09.570
<v Speaker 1>drive all the way up until you hit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>North Sea or the English Channel and cut</v>

1354
01:17:09.601 --> 01:17:14.601
<v Speaker 1>off that sledge hammer head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad idea if he can make it </v>

1355
01:17:15.551 --> 01:17:16.870
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like judo.</v>

1356
01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:21.190
<v Speaker 1>You just took that great enemy advantage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of so many good troops in one location.</v>

1357
01:17:21.191 --> 01:17:26.191
<v Speaker 1>They're like a steam roller and turned </v>
<v Speaker 1>it into a negative because now you're </v>

1358
01:17:26.191 --> 01:17:27.790
<v Speaker 1>going to cut off the best part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy army surrounded and kill it.</v>

1359
01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:32.940
<v Speaker 1>You know in one place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great idea if you can make it </v>

1360
01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:32.950
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The French are totally incapable at this</v>

1361
01:17:32.951 --> 01:17:34.900
<v Speaker 1>point in the war of making something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that work</v>

1362
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:38.770
<v Speaker 1>because they hadn't learned what kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>war they were in yet.</v>

1363
01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:41.290
<v Speaker 1>That's what the battle of the frontiers </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be.</v>

1364
01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:44.830
<v Speaker 1>This first round of this fight where </v>
<v Speaker 1>where everybody's throwing haymakers and</v>

1365
01:17:44.831 --> 01:17:49.831
<v Speaker 1>getting smacked on the jaw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to teach a lot of lessons to </v>

1366
01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:51.160
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer will fire more generals in this</v>

1367
01:17:51.161 --> 01:17:56.161
<v Speaker 1>first month of the war than anybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever fired in history and a lot of the </v>

1368
01:17:56.161 --> 01:17:58.150
<v Speaker 1>other militaries will do similar things </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is where we find out,</v>

1369
01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:03.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which generals can really fight in war </v>

1370
01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:05.191
<v Speaker 1>time and which ones are more peace time </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of generals and within a couple of </v>

1371
01:18:05.191 --> 01:18:07.880
<v Speaker 1>months you'll have much more competent </v>
<v Speaker 1>people you know,</v>

1372
01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:10.870
<v Speaker 1>at the helmet a lot of places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes it a little less fun.</v>

1373
01:18:10.871 --> 01:18:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now it's,</v>

1374
01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:17.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wild west out here and you have all </v>

1375
01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:19.981
<v Speaker 1>kinds of different quality people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the Russian generals that were </v>

1376
01:18:19.981 --> 01:18:23.020
<v Speaker 1>going to deal with in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's variable quality and this</v>

1377
01:18:23.021 --> 01:18:26.590
<v Speaker 1>becomes a real live fire test for a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these people</v>

1378
01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:33.180
<v Speaker 1>on the 21st of August and the 22nd of </v>
<v Speaker 1>August,</v>

1379
01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:36.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm Jennifer launches his big offensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the yard.</v>

1380
01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he assumes he's running into an inferior</v>

1381
01:18:40.111 --> 01:18:43.080
<v Speaker 1>number of German forces based on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>calculations.</v>

1382
01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:48.560
<v Speaker 1>He's instead walking into a situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he's facing almost equal numbers </v>

1383
01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:53.451
<v Speaker 1>of troops and their dugin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm waiting for him and this is where </v>

1384
01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:59.660
<v Speaker 1>the idea of bay and net attacks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>charging machine guns and not digging in</v>

1385
01:19:02.941 --> 01:19:03.990
<v Speaker 1>with your red pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1386
01:19:03.991 --> 01:19:06.150
<v Speaker 1>we didn't even mention the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>none of these armies,</v>

1387
01:19:06.151 --> 01:19:09.090
<v Speaker 1>none of them are going into this war </v>
<v Speaker 1>with helmets.</v>

1388
01:19:09.210 --> 01:19:11.130
<v Speaker 1>There are no helmets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>

1389
01:19:11.490 --> 01:19:13.830
<v Speaker 1>they're wearing caps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1390
01:19:13.831 --> 01:19:16.440
<v Speaker 1>You know how many people are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>die because of that mistake.</v>

1391
01:19:18.450 --> 01:19:22.260
<v Speaker 1>This is all kind of when that romance in</v>
<v Speaker 1>war gets shot down,</v>

1392
01:19:22.410 --> 01:19:23.130
<v Speaker 1>literally,</v>

1393
01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:28.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean to people of a 19th century sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of worldview and attitudes about honor </v>

1394
01:19:29.311 --> 01:19:31.530
<v Speaker 1>and duty and the things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>expected of,</v>

1395
01:19:31.531 --> 01:19:33.300
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>officers in the field,</v>

1396
01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:38.600
<v Speaker 1>this idea of French officers standing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a sword and in a white gloves and </v>

1397
01:19:39.511 --> 01:19:44.511
<v Speaker 1>often the white hat in a storm of steel </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a move that is absolutely suicidal </v>

1398
01:19:45.721 --> 01:19:48.390
<v Speaker 1>and those brave people must have known </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1399
01:19:48.391 --> 01:19:53.391
<v Speaker 1>Imagine how the soul gets conflicted and</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing to do your duty and live up to </v>

1400
01:19:53.391 --> 01:19:58.041
<v Speaker 1>the standards and expectations of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>countrymen and your people during this </v>

1401
01:19:58.041 --> 01:20:01.311
<v Speaker 1>time period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were expected to stand up there and </v>

1402
01:20:01.311 --> 01:20:05.160
<v Speaker 1>and essentially face sure death when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might survive simply by laying on the </v>

1403
01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:09.951
<v Speaker 1>ground and throw away that white hat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just kind of hide behind that tree </v>

1404
01:20:09.951 --> 01:20:13.881
<v Speaker 1>or whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the top permitted is a romance </v>

1405
01:20:13.881 --> 01:20:13.980
<v Speaker 1>and certain standards and this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroic death.</v>

1406
01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:16.170
<v Speaker 1>This is what the elder von Moltke was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

1407
01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:19.770
<v Speaker 1>You know that we quoted earlier where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about how perpetual peace was not</v>

1408
01:20:19.771 --> 01:20:24.771
<v Speaker 1>even a good dream because you lose all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these wonderful values that warfare </v>

1409
01:20:24.771 --> 01:20:26.580
<v Speaker 1>brings out to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that officer,</v>

1410
01:20:26.670 --> 01:20:30.780
<v Speaker 1>those officers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those many hundreds of officers dying on</v>

1411
01:20:30.781 --> 01:20:33.810
<v Speaker 1>these fields in their white gloves </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they wouldn't take cover.</v>

1412
01:20:34.050 --> 01:20:37.410
<v Speaker 1>We're doing something beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an admirable.</v>

1413
01:20:37.890 --> 01:20:42.890
<v Speaker 1>Remember he said in that quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used that in war man's noblest.</v>

1414
01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Virtues come into play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Courage and renunciation,</v>

1415
01:20:46.890 --> 01:20:51.890
<v Speaker 1>fidelity to duty and a readiness for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice that does not stop at giving </v>

1416
01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:54.330
<v Speaker 1>up life itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To him,</v>

1417
01:20:54.331 --> 01:20:57.660
<v Speaker 1>this is the charge of the light brigade </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over and over again.</v>

1418
01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:02.900
<v Speaker 1>Modern people look at this as foolish to</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

1419
01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:05.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a waste of that officer's life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential.</v>

1420
01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:11.240
<v Speaker 1>Use Him in a way that will achieve a </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful and if he has to give up his </v>

1421
01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.180
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell it more dearly than that.</v>

1422
01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Two people of the time period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that that ends really with this</v>

1423
01:21:17.071 --> 01:21:22.071
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was value in what those officers </v>

1424
01:21:22.071 --> 01:21:25.851
<v Speaker 1>were doing simply by dying like that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>upholding the standards,</v>

1425
01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:31.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were upholding by doing so a </v>

1426
01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:34.341
<v Speaker 1>higher fidelity to duty and readiness to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice as von mold cassette.</v>

1427
01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:39.980
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that this war changes </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that whole view,</v>

1428
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:46.030
<v Speaker 1>the people in 1918 at the end of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>war would feel very similar to the way </v>

1429
01:21:46.030 --> 01:21:50.381
<v Speaker 1>we do about how stupid it is to stand up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a hailstorm of steel and just,</v>

1430
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:52.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice your life for nothing.</v>

1431
01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:58.120
<v Speaker 1>The generation that does that in 1914 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of which doesn't make it </v>

1432
01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:01.901
<v Speaker 1>through the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had a different way of looking at </v>

1433
01:22:01.901 --> 01:22:05.351
<v Speaker 1>things and older way and that's why this</v>
<v Speaker 1>war is often seen as a separation point </v>

1434
01:22:07.551 --> 01:22:09.500
<v Speaker 1>in history between one world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

1435
01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:16.470
<v Speaker 1>The running into this new world as part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this attack against the giant center </v>

1436
01:22:17.351 --> 01:22:22.351
<v Speaker 1>of the front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the yard in forest and </v>

1437
01:22:22.351 --> 01:22:22.351
<v Speaker 1>everything comes off sounding like a dry</v>
<v Speaker 1>affair.</v>

1438
01:22:22.351 --> 01:22:23.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when historians write about it,</v>

1439
01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.530
<v Speaker 1>not that they're dry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but listen,</v>

1440
01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:29.620
<v Speaker 1>history sometimes takes the emotion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the blood and everything out of it.</v>

1441
01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:34.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Stevenson has a great one volume </v>

1442
01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:38.041
<v Speaker 1>work on the war and here's how he </v>
<v Speaker 1>describes these offensives by genre and </v>

1443
01:22:38.041 --> 01:22:41.080
<v Speaker 1>the French to strike against what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly a week German center,</v>

1444
01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:43.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

1445
01:22:43.001 --> 01:22:45.940
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the result was a multiple disaster.</v>

1446
01:22:46.090 --> 01:22:51.090
<v Speaker 1>The French forces entering the arden </v>
<v Speaker 1>were weaker than the Germans in </v>

1447
01:22:51.090 --> 01:22:53.110
<v Speaker 1>reconnaissance cavalry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on the morning of 22nd August,</v>

1448
01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:58.260
<v Speaker 1>missed grounded their aircraft groping </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward in echelon along the few roads </v>

1449
01:22:58.511 --> 01:23:01.930
<v Speaker 1>through the forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they blundered nodding to weaker forces,</v>

1450
01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:05.110
<v Speaker 1>but into 21 divisions against their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>20.</v>

1451
01:23:05.290 --> 01:23:06.160
<v Speaker 1>They're 75</v>

1452
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:11.160
<v Speaker 5>millimeter field guns were ineffective </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the hilly terrain and poorly linked </v>

1453
01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:15.301
<v Speaker 5>by telephone with the infantry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were no answer to the German </v>

1454
01:23:15.301 --> 01:23:17.110
<v Speaker 5>machine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>guns and field howitzers which retallack</v>

1455
01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:18.760
<v Speaker 5>and quote,</v>

1456
01:23:20.570 --> 01:23:22.280
<v Speaker 5>what is wreaking havoc.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mean.</v>

1457
01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:28.660
<v Speaker 5>Historian Peter Hart's book on the Great</v>
<v Speaker 5>War has many wonderful firsthand </v>

1458
01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:33.070
<v Speaker 5>accounts of what these experiences were </v>
<v Speaker 5>like and hard himself writes about the </v>

1459
01:23:33.651 --> 01:23:37.670
<v Speaker 5>stumbling into each other that are these</v>
<v Speaker 5>battles in the middle of the front,</v>

1460
01:23:37.671 --> 01:23:42.110
<v Speaker 5>through this forested hilly terrain </v>
<v Speaker 5>quote in these battles,</v>

1461
01:23:42.111 --> 01:23:47.111
<v Speaker 5>few people at any level of command had </v>
<v Speaker 5>much idea of what was happening and for </v>

1462
01:23:47.111 --> 01:23:49.190
<v Speaker 5>the troops on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was all utterly baffling.</v>

1463
01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:54.400
<v Speaker 5>Prewar tactic seemed to have no impact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bayonet charge is lead only to more </v>

1464
01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:58.160
<v Speaker 5>slaughter while calling up artillery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Support was often doomed to failure.</v>

1465
01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:00.710
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

1466
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:03.170
<v Speaker 5>sometimes the gunners were too far </v>
<v Speaker 5>behind,</v>

1467
01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:06.770
<v Speaker 5>sometimes too close and caught under </v>
<v Speaker 5>fire from the longer range.</v>

1468
01:24:06.771 --> 01:24:09.380
<v Speaker 5>German guns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever the reason he writes.</v>

1469
01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:12.320
<v Speaker 5>The infantry were often left in </v>
<v Speaker 5>desperate straits,</v>

1470
01:24:12.710 --> 01:24:17.710
<v Speaker 5>and then he quotes a captain from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hundred and third regiment who was </v>

1471
01:24:17.710 --> 01:24:17.710
<v Speaker 5>caught in desperate straits.</v>

1472
01:24:17.710 --> 01:24:20.810
<v Speaker 5>Quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my company was sustaining heavy losses.</v>

1473
01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:26.020
<v Speaker 5>Evidently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's action was hampering the enemy who </v>

1474
01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:26.270
<v Speaker 5>concentrated the combined fire of his </v>
<v Speaker 5>infantry,</v>

1475
01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:28.580
<v Speaker 5>artillery,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and machine guns on us.</v>

1476
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:33.790
<v Speaker 5>We were surrounded by a heavy cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which at times completely veiled the </v>

1477
01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:36.560
<v Speaker 5>battlefield from our eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Little Burger guy or sprang up shouted,</v>

1478
01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:41.060
<v Speaker 5>Viva La France at the top of his voice </v>
<v Speaker 5>and fell dead among the men lying on the</v>

1479
01:24:41.061 --> 01:24:46.061
<v Speaker 5>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One could no longer distinguish the </v>

1480
01:24:46.061 --> 01:24:48.311
<v Speaker 5>living from the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first were entirely absolved by </v>

1481
01:24:48.311 --> 01:24:48.920
<v Speaker 5>their grim duty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The others lay motionless.</v>

1482
01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:51.530
<v Speaker 5>The wounded offered a truly impressive </v>
<v Speaker 5>sight.</v>

1483
01:24:52.010 --> 01:24:56.450
<v Speaker 5>The quote continues sometimes they would</v>
<v Speaker 5>stand up bloody and horrible looking.</v>

1484
01:24:56.540 --> 01:25:01.540
<v Speaker 5>Amidst burst of gunfire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they ran aimlessly around arms </v>

1485
01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:04.190
<v Speaker 5>stretching out before them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eyes staring at the ground,</v>

1486
01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:07.790
<v Speaker 5>turning round and round until hit buy </v>
<v Speaker 5>fresh bullets.</v>

1487
01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:11.420
<v Speaker 5>They would stop and fall heavily.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Heart rending cries,</v>

1488
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:16.510
<v Speaker 5>agonizing appeals and horrible groans </v>
<v Speaker 5>were intermingled with the sinister </v>

1489
01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:20.651
<v Speaker 5>howling of projectiles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Furious contortions told of strong </v>

1490
01:25:20.651 --> 01:25:22.820
<v Speaker 5>youthful bodies refusing to give up </v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

1491
01:25:23.090 --> 01:25:27.410
<v Speaker 5>One man was trying to replace his bloody</v>
<v Speaker 5>dangling hand was shattered wrist.</v>

1492
01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:32.600
<v Speaker 5>Another ran from the line holding the </v>
<v Speaker 5>bowels falling out of his belly and </v>

1493
01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:33.380
<v Speaker 5>through his tattered clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Before long,</v>

1494
01:25:33.381 --> 01:25:37.640
<v Speaker 5>a bullet struck him down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had no support from our artillery,</v>

1495
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:40.550
<v Speaker 5>and you have to Reagan's in our division</v>
<v Speaker 5>and in the army corps.</v>

1496
01:25:40.551 --> 01:25:43.280
<v Speaker 5>Besides those destroyed on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where were they?</v>

1497
01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:47.340
<v Speaker 5>Why didn't they arrive?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were alone in quote</v>

1498
01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:54.400
<v Speaker 5>27,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>freshmen will die on the 22nd of August.</v>

1499
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:59.090
<v Speaker 5>Many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>many more will be badly,</v>

1500
01:25:59.091 --> 01:26:01.550
<v Speaker 5>badly wounded,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and maimed and scarred for life.</v>

1501
01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:04.060
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's put</v>

1502
01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:07.540
<v Speaker 1>this in perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred years before this time,</v>

1503
01:26:07.541 --> 01:26:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Napoleon used to brag to his opponents </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you cannot stop me.</v>

1504
01:26:12.370 --> 01:26:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I spend 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives a month as though that was a big </v>

1505
01:26:17.370 --> 01:26:21.280
<v Speaker 1>deal in back when Napoleon said it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the French had just lost 30,000</v>

1506
01:26:21.281 --> 01:26:26.281
<v Speaker 1>lives that day and their contact against</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other major army that had </v>

1507
01:26:27.821 --> 01:26:32.350
<v Speaker 1>precipitated all those deaths has only </v>
<v Speaker 1>been about 24 hours long.</v>

1508
01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.830
<v Speaker 1>What's tomorrow going to look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the next day</v>

1509
01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:40.410
<v Speaker 1>already troops were dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1510
01:26:40.411 --> 01:26:43.530
<v Speaker 1>a new phenomenon created by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>artillery,</v>

1511
01:26:43.770 --> 01:26:48.770
<v Speaker 1>the bigger heavy guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extra ammunition and the fact that </v>

1512
01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:51.260
<v Speaker 1>battles are going on for a long time now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people stay in place for awhile mean</v>

1513
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:55.680
<v Speaker 1>that people are staying under artillery </v>
<v Speaker 1>barrage for longer and longer periods of</v>

1514
01:26:55.681 --> 01:27:00.681
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a frightfully upsetting </v>

1515
01:27:00.681 --> 01:27:00.681
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you might imagine,</v>

1516
01:27:00.681 --> 01:27:03.960
<v Speaker 1>and it begins to drive people insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1517
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:08.990
<v Speaker 1>As the war starts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a French sergeant wrote in his diary </v>

1518
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:11.640
<v Speaker 1>about these offensives and Dr Dan on </v>
<v Speaker 1>August 20,</v>

1519
01:27:11.641 --> 01:27:12.870
<v Speaker 1>first 22nd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

1520
01:27:12.871 --> 01:27:16.320
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guns recoil at each shot,</v>

1521
01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:21.620
<v Speaker 1>night is falling and they look like old </v>
<v Speaker 1>men sticking out their tongues and </v>

1522
01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:22.380
<v Speaker 1>spitting fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heaps of corpses.</v>

1523
01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.750
<v Speaker 1>French and German are lying every which </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1524
01:27:24.751 --> 01:27:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Rifles in hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rain is falling.</v>

1525
01:27:27.181 --> 01:27:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Shells are screaming and bursting shells</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

1526
01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Artillery fire is the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lay all night listening to the </v>

1527
01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:35.600
<v Speaker 1>wounded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>groaning.</v>

1528
01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.710
<v Speaker 1>Some were German.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Canon nading goes on.</v>

1529
01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Whenever it stops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hear the wounded crying from all over</v>

1530
01:27:40.621 --> 01:27:43.460
<v Speaker 1>the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two or three men go mad every day</v>

1531
01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:45.930
<v Speaker 3>and quote,</v>

1532
01:27:47.890 --> 01:27:52.890
<v Speaker 1>a man who will turn out to be one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>France's greatest public figures in the </v>

1533
01:27:52.890 --> 01:27:56.941
<v Speaker 1>20th century was at these battles too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had been indoctrinated like everyone </v>

1534
01:27:57.071 --> 01:28:02.071
<v Speaker 1>else in the romance and the heroism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas of the band at charge and the </v>

1535
01:28:02.071 --> 01:28:05.590
<v Speaker 1>offensive and all these military ideas </v>
<v Speaker 1>from another age.</v>

1536
01:28:06.190 --> 01:28:10.870
<v Speaker 1>It took him one bottle to learn the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lessons that it would take commanders on</v>

1537
01:28:10.871 --> 01:28:13.240
<v Speaker 1>all sides in this war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a bit longer to learn.</v>

1538
01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Lieutenant Charles de Gaulle wrote of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these battles and his experience in </v>

1539
01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:18.980
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

1540
01:28:19.630 --> 01:28:24.630
<v Speaker 1>suddenly the enemy's fire became precise</v>
<v Speaker 1>and concentrated second-by-second the </v>

1541
01:28:24.641 --> 01:28:27.430
<v Speaker 1>hail of bullets and the thunder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shells grew stronger.</v>

1542
01:28:27.730 --> 01:28:32.730
<v Speaker 1>Those who survived the lay flat on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground amidst the screaming wounded in </v>

1543
01:28:32.730 --> 01:28:36.631
<v Speaker 1>the humble corpses with affected calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The officers let themselves be killed,</v>

1544
01:28:36.791 --> 01:28:40.630
<v Speaker 1>standing upright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some obstinate platoons stuck their band</v>

1545
01:28:40.631 --> 01:28:43.810
<v Speaker 1>that's into their rifles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bugle sound into the charge.</v>

1546
01:28:43.930 --> 01:28:48.130
<v Speaker 1>Isolated heroes made fantastic leaps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all to no purpose.</v>

1547
01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:53.310
<v Speaker 1>In an instant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it did become clear that not all the </v>

1548
01:28:53.310 --> 01:28:53.310
<v Speaker 1>courage in the world could withstand </v>
<v Speaker 1>this fire,</v>

1549
01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:54.650
<v Speaker 3>and to quote</v>

1550
01:28:55.770 --> 01:29:00.770
<v Speaker 1>the machines that had always been </v>
<v Speaker 1>important on the battlefields of </v>

1551
01:29:00.770 --> 01:29:03.720
<v Speaker 1>humankind had become the dominant </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor.</v>

1552
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:08.750
<v Speaker 1>What had become a tool to be used by man</v>
<v Speaker 1>was now something that was so </v>

1553
01:29:09.571 --> 01:29:14.571
<v Speaker 1>devastating in the hands of each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the entire ideas about warfare that</v>

1554
01:29:15.511 --> 01:29:20.511
<v Speaker 1>had been in play in most societies </v>
<v Speaker 1>during those time periods up until this </v>

1555
01:29:20.511 --> 01:29:23.550
<v Speaker 1>era are all of a sudden no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>viable.</v>

1556
01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:30.950
<v Speaker 1>The Battle of the frontiers in just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of days manages to completely </v>

1557
01:29:31.651 --> 01:29:36.651
<v Speaker 1>change the whole complexion of the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it seemed to be leading up to a </v>

1558
01:29:36.931 --> 01:29:41.931
<v Speaker 1>German defeat all of a sudden looks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the Germans are going to win this </v>

1559
01:29:42.931 --> 01:29:47.760
<v Speaker 1>war and quickly nobody expects the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French to lose and a couple of days more</v>

1560
01:29:47.761 --> 01:29:52.130
<v Speaker 1>than 75,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>men killed and more than 250,000</v>

1561
01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:57.140
<v Speaker 1>wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuns everyone but the French </v>

1562
01:29:57.140 --> 01:30:01.431
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to understand how many </v>

1563
01:30:01.431 --> 01:30:01.800
<v Speaker 1>people this is the American still </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrate.</v>

1564
01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:03.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a morbid sort of way.</v>

1565
01:30:04.110 --> 01:30:09.110
<v Speaker 1>The famous civil war battle of Antietam </v>
<v Speaker 1>famously called the bloodiest day in </v>

1566
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:13.431
<v Speaker 1>American history in terms of warfare and</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because it's a civil war and </v>

1567
01:30:13.431 --> 01:30:14.670
<v Speaker 1>everybody dying on both sides happens to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be American,</v>

1568
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:19.710
<v Speaker 1>but those casualty levels for comparison</v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes are about 6,000.</v>

1569
01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:21.280
<v Speaker 1>A little less than 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>

1570
01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:24.090
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a little less than 20,000</v>

1571
01:30:24.091 --> 01:30:25.980
<v Speaker 1>wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>6,000</v>

1572
01:30:25.981 --> 01:30:26.820
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,000</v>

1573
01:30:26.821 --> 01:30:30.690
<v Speaker 1>wounded compared to more than 75,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead in 260,000</v>

1574
01:30:30.691 --> 01:30:34.470
<v Speaker 1>wounded in the first couple of days of </v>
<v Speaker 1>action on the western front.</v>

1575
01:30:34.471 --> 01:30:38.430
<v Speaker 1>The French are just stunned and now if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the German general,</v>

1576
01:30:38.431 --> 01:30:43.431
<v Speaker 1>put yourself in von Moltke shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the stress we talked about and </v>

1577
01:30:43.431 --> 01:30:43.860
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you are presented with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dilemma.</v>

1578
01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:47.610
<v Speaker 1>If you just did this to your opponent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've stunned them in,</v>

1579
01:30:47.611 --> 01:30:50.250
<v Speaker 1>they're on the ropes and they look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>deer in the headlights for a minute.</v>

1580
01:30:50.370 --> 01:30:55.370
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you stick with the original plan and </v>

1581
01:30:55.370 --> 01:30:55.370
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1582
01:30:55.370 --> 01:30:57.510
<v Speaker 1>we're not supposed to attack here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the sledge hammer going.</v>

1583
01:30:57.511 --> 01:31:02.511
<v Speaker 1>Stick with a sledge hammer and just let </v>
<v Speaker 1>the French recover in front of you </v>

1584
01:31:02.511 --> 01:31:03.330
<v Speaker 1>because it's part of the plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do you say,</v>

1585
01:31:03.930 --> 01:31:08.340
<v Speaker 1>as the uncle of unmold Qa so famously </v>
<v Speaker 1>did that.</v>

1586
01:31:08.341 --> 01:31:13.341
<v Speaker 1>No battle plan survives first contact </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the enemy and look at this as an </v>

1587
01:31:13.341 --> 01:31:17.811
<v Speaker 1>opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a battlefield opportunity that presents </v>

1588
01:31:17.811 --> 01:31:20.481
<v Speaker 1>itself multiple has to make some </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions here and it becomes another </v>

1589
01:31:20.481 --> 01:31:22.590
<v Speaker 1>place in the story where historians have</v>
<v Speaker 1>argued ever sense whether or not he lost</v>

1590
01:31:22.591 --> 01:31:24.310
<v Speaker 1>a war here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1591
01:31:24.490 --> 01:31:26.820
<v Speaker 1>those who didn't believe you lost it </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier in the story.</v>

1592
01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:32.060
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them believe he lost it here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of German generals writing </v>

1593
01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:32.060
<v Speaker 1>memoirs after the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1594
01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:34.920
<v Speaker 1>needle him about this savagely making </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad decisions,</v>

1595
01:31:34.921 --> 01:31:35.790
<v Speaker 1>weakening the plan.</v>

1596
01:31:35.970 --> 01:31:40.970
<v Speaker 1>What we all have to understand about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>plan as it's normally thought of and </v>

1597
01:31:41.371 --> 01:31:44.790
<v Speaker 1>some very good modern historians have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done a great job of pointing this out,</v>

1598
01:31:45.090 --> 01:31:50.090
<v Speaker 1>is that the plan was probably flawed </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the get go and was probably never </v>

1599
01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:53.110
<v Speaker 1>meant to be implemented in the way a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these German generals portrayed it.</v>

1600
01:31:53.130 --> 01:31:58.130
<v Speaker 1>And even more important than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence seems to show that members of </v>

1601
01:31:58.130 --> 01:31:59.500
<v Speaker 1>the general staff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe von Moltke included,</v>

1602
01:31:59.620 --> 01:32:02.620
<v Speaker 1>never thought the plan was going to win </v>
<v Speaker 1>the war anyway,</v>

1603
01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:06.250
<v Speaker 1>which means it becomes your plan for </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting the conflict.</v>

1604
01:32:06.251 --> 01:32:08.000
<v Speaker 1>And then once everything is in motion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1605
01:32:08.001 --> 01:32:10.060
<v Speaker 1>you look for opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to create some,</v>

1606
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:13.160
<v Speaker 1>you try to exploit French mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's traditional generalship,</v>

1607
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:18.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the French are doing on their </v>

1608
01:32:18.270 --> 01:32:20.101
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so von Moltke make some decisions </v>

1609
01:32:20.101 --> 01:32:21.220
<v Speaker 1>based on having slammed the French so </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

1610
01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.980
<v Speaker 1>He's got prince rubric does very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1611
01:32:23.981 --> 01:32:27.550
<v Speaker 1>down in the south screaming that now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's pushed the French back all the</v>

1612
01:32:27.551 --> 01:32:28.960
<v Speaker 1>way to the French border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did he,</v>

1613
01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:33.990
<v Speaker 1>why did he just slammed them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could collapse the whole southern </v>

1614
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:36.580
<v Speaker 1>flank and if the whole southern flank </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapses and you still get the northern</v>

1615
01:32:36.581 --> 01:32:38.740
<v Speaker 1>flank collapsing because of your sledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammer,</v>

1616
01:32:38.741 --> 01:32:41.080
<v Speaker 1>my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've recreated the battle of cannae.</v>

1617
01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:43.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Romans and handle all over</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

1618
01:32:43.751 --> 01:32:47.470
<v Speaker 1>It's every generals dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A double envelopment,</v>

1619
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:51.100
<v Speaker 1>a total surrounding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it von Moltke.</v>

1620
01:32:51.101 --> 01:32:54.340
<v Speaker 1>We're less of an art fanatic and more of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a military,</v>

1621
01:32:54.341 --> 01:32:55.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1622
01:32:55.420 --> 01:33:00.420
<v Speaker 1>hobbyist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think he would find that </v>

1623
01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:00.420
<v Speaker 1>irresistible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>

1624
01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:02.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's just looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities to outflank French forces.</v>

1625
01:33:02.921 --> 01:33:05.320
<v Speaker 1>As historian David Stevenson suggests </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

1626
01:33:05.820 --> 01:33:07.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

1627
01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:10.600
<v Speaker 1>mold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because actions at this juncture suggest</v>

1628
01:33:10.601 --> 01:33:13.510
<v Speaker 1>that he was determined to protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany's territory,</v>

1629
01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:15.880
<v Speaker 1>whether in east,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prussia or Alsace,</v>

1630
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:21.000
<v Speaker 1>but willing to strike wherever the enemy</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed weak rather than staking </v>

1631
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.360
<v Speaker 1>everything on his right flank and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote.</v>

1632
01:33:23.930 --> 01:33:28.090
<v Speaker 1>So the staking everything on the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>flank idea is just what you do.</v>

1633
01:33:28.091 --> 01:33:30.220
<v Speaker 1>If no other better opportunities </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop.</v>

1634
01:33:30.370 --> 01:33:34.330
<v Speaker 1>And when Crown Prince rubrics suggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking the French down in the south,</v>

1635
01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:37.450
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun Mocha thinks about it and says,</v>

1636
01:33:37.451 --> 01:33:42.451
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and agrees to take some forces that </v>

1637
01:33:42.451 --> 01:33:46.501
<v Speaker 1>would be used to bolster the sledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>hammer head and instead use them on the </v>

1638
01:33:46.501 --> 01:33:51.031
<v Speaker 1>total other side of the flank down south</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help rubric in his offensive against </v>

1639
01:33:51.521 --> 01:33:56.521
<v Speaker 1>the French in the south,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the plan is now being diluted in the </v>

1640
01:33:56.521 --> 01:33:58.150
<v Speaker 1>minds of the purists and they may be </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1641
01:33:58.151 --> 01:34:00.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm not taking sides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying the traditional ideas,</v>

1642
01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:05.460
<v Speaker 1>but the Maloca screwed up the war here </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and some very good historians are </v>

1643
01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:05.460
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

1644
01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:10.291
<v Speaker 1>This is what you were trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look for opportunities and exploit them </v>

1645
01:34:10.291 --> 01:34:14.161
<v Speaker 1>without losing the war elsewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which creates a situation though that </v>

1646
01:34:14.161 --> 01:34:18.181
<v Speaker 1>Malacca himself even says after the war </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a mistake and it involves his </v>

1647
01:34:18.181 --> 01:34:20.170
<v Speaker 1>attempts to try not to lose the war </v>
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere.</v>

1648
01:34:20.170 --> 01:34:21.910
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put yourself in his position,</v>

1649
01:34:22.210 --> 01:34:27.210
<v Speaker 1>it's hard not to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Multiple looks at the western front and </v>

1650
01:34:27.210 --> 01:34:30.270
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it's going pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know the battle of the frontiers and the</v>

1651
01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:35.420
<v Speaker 1>battle in Alsace Alsace-lorraine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these things seem to show that the </v>

1652
01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Germans are better than the French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said in the last episode.</v>

1653
01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:38.140
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

1654
01:34:38.141 --> 01:34:43.141
<v Speaker 1>one of the great armies of all time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they just showed is that they </v>

1655
01:34:43.141 --> 01:34:44.410
<v Speaker 1>dominate another great army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1656
01:34:44.411 --> 01:34:49.411
<v Speaker 1>pretty easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're von Moltke you could sit </v>

1657
01:34:49.411 --> 01:34:49.411
<v Speaker 1>there and look at that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1658
01:34:49.411 --> 01:34:49.411
<v Speaker 1>well all of our calculations are out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>window.</v>

1659
01:34:49.411 --> 01:34:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we don't need such dominance in </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

1660
01:34:51.990 --> 01:34:56.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where quality is such that maybe we </v>

1661
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 1>could get away with taking a few troops </v>
<v Speaker 1>from here and taken them to</v>

1662
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:00.740
<v Speaker 5>the east because the Russians are taken </v>
<v Speaker 5>towns in east Prussia</v>

1663
01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:07.880
<v Speaker 5>and that's what Malka did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First he changed the commander's over </v>

1664
01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:11.721
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's sack the guys he was having </v>

1665
01:35:11.721 --> 01:35:13.011
<v Speaker 5>problems with and he puts an old retired</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy who is more known for the Franco </v>

1666
01:35:13.011 --> 01:35:16.020
<v Speaker 5>Prussian war services and in fact calls </v>
<v Speaker 5>him out of retirement so quickly that he</v>

1667
01:35:16.021 --> 01:35:19.020
<v Speaker 5>has to put on his old blue uniform </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he doesn't have one of the newer</v>

1668
01:35:19.021 --> 01:35:24.021
<v Speaker 5>gray ones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The blue ones date back to the earlier </v>

1669
01:35:24.021 --> 01:35:25.890
<v Speaker 5>war and combines this older retired guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>whose name is Hindenburg,</v>

1670
01:35:25.891 --> 01:35:30.891
<v Speaker 5>Paul von Hindenburg with the hero from </v>
<v Speaker 5>the German point of view of that attack </v>

1671
01:35:31.141 --> 01:35:32.130
<v Speaker 5>against,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1672
01:35:32.131 --> 01:35:35.430
<v Speaker 5>the Belgian city of Leanne and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fortress there who banged on the door of</v>

1673
01:35:35.431 --> 01:35:40.431
<v Speaker 5>the fortress with the hilt of a sword </v>
<v Speaker 5>and took the surrender of the city kind </v>

1674
01:35:40.431 --> 01:35:41.490
<v Speaker 5>of by himself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of Erich Ludendorff,</v>

1675
01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:46.880
<v Speaker 5>Ludina,</v>
<v Speaker 5>orphan Hindenburg get this job or sent </v>

1676
01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:49.371
<v Speaker 5>to the east to figure the situation out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then von Moltke sends them these </v>

1677
01:35:49.371 --> 01:35:49.371
<v Speaker 5>troops,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>

1678
01:35:49.371 --> 01:35:50.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>historians later said,</v>

1679
01:35:50.281 --> 01:35:55.281
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it really needed those troops in the </v>

1680
01:35:55.281 --> 01:35:56.691
<v Speaker 5>west.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He shouldn't defend them and he </v>

1681
01:35:56.691 --> 01:35:56.691
<v Speaker 5>shouldn't have sent him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he didn't know that.</v>

1682
01:35:56.691 --> 01:35:57.300
<v Speaker 5>He said after the war was one of his </v>
<v Speaker 5>biggest mistakes,</v>

1683
01:35:57.390 --> 01:36:00.360
<v Speaker 5>he shouldn't have them because it'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>turn out that by the time the troops get</v>

1684
01:36:00.510 --> 01:36:04.320
<v Speaker 5>from the west to the east on the trains,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they are no longer needed.</v>

1685
01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:07.020
<v Speaker 5>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

1686
01:36:07.021 --> 01:36:12.021
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a historian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although historians debate this and </v>

1687
01:36:12.021 --> 01:36:12.780
<v Speaker 5>argue about it ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So who knows?</v>

1688
01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:15.030
<v Speaker 5>Maybe we can all take a position on </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

1689
01:36:15.031 --> 01:36:18.660
<v Speaker 5>but looking at it from the sources that </v>
<v Speaker 5>I have,</v>

1690
01:36:18.661 --> 01:36:21.840
<v Speaker 5>looking at von Moltke as decision here </v>
<v Speaker 5>looks like prudence.</v>

1691
01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:26.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean the Russians are taking towns in </v>
<v Speaker 5>east Prussia,</v>

1692
01:36:26.271 --> 01:36:30.020
<v Speaker 5>forcing the little teeny German forces </v>
<v Speaker 5>that are there to retreat.</v>

1693
01:36:30.170 --> 01:36:32.780
<v Speaker 5>It looks like they're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>threatening Berlin.</v>

1694
01:36:32.781 --> 01:36:34.340
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the western front,</v>

1695
01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:39.760
<v Speaker 5>it looks like the force you put there to</v>
<v Speaker 5>simply keep the French occupied while </v>

1696
01:36:40.131 --> 01:36:45.131
<v Speaker 5>the killing force maneuvers around their</v>
<v Speaker 5>flank may have defeated the French all </v>

1697
01:36:45.381 --> 01:36:50.381
<v Speaker 5>by themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happens when you beat the French </v>

1698
01:36:50.381 --> 01:36:50.381
<v Speaker 5>before the killing thing even gets </v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

1699
01:36:50.381 --> 01:36:54.940
<v Speaker 5>and then someone wanders.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you can spare a couple of cores for </v>

1700
01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:57.851
<v Speaker 5>the eastern front in von Moltke </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposedly even asks one of the </v>

1701
01:36:57.851 --> 01:37:02.531
<v Speaker 5>commanders of one of the armies that </v>
<v Speaker 5>makes up this sledge hammer swinging </v>

1702
01:37:02.531 --> 01:37:07.061
<v Speaker 5>gate thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know that flanking force that's the </v>

1703
01:37:07.061 --> 01:37:09.911
<v Speaker 5>size of Napoleon's grand army or the </v>
<v Speaker 5>size of the Roman Empire's complete </v>

1704
01:37:10.161 --> 01:37:13.400
<v Speaker 5>military at tight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He asks the commander of Second Army von</v>

1705
01:37:13.401 --> 01:37:16.010
<v Speaker 5>Bulow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can you spare a few core for the east?</v>

1706
01:37:16.011 --> 01:37:17.240
<v Speaker 5>And von Bulow says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1707
01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:18.710
<v Speaker 5>you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

1708
01:37:18.711 --> 01:37:20.960
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in part because he just matched a French</v>

1709
01:37:20.961 --> 01:37:23.090
<v Speaker 5>army in front of him during the battle </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the frontiers,</v>

1710
01:37:23.390 --> 01:37:28.130
<v Speaker 5>which happened to be the poor fifth army</v>
<v Speaker 5>commanded by that one French general who</v>

1711
01:37:28.131 --> 01:37:31.460
<v Speaker 5>saw the sledge hammer forming even </v>
<v Speaker 5>before the war started.</v>

1712
01:37:31.461 --> 01:37:32.840
<v Speaker 5>Poor General Len resnick,</v>

1713
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:38.080
<v Speaker 5>and because he argues with the high </v>
<v Speaker 5>command to let him just shift his army a</v>

1714
01:37:38.081 --> 01:37:43.081
<v Speaker 5>little bit to protect its flanks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some historians think he saved Fifth </v>

1715
01:37:43.081 --> 01:37:45.070
<v Speaker 5>Army from total annihilation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He does have to retreat though,</v>

1716
01:37:46.210 --> 01:37:51.210
<v Speaker 5>move backwards once again to keep in </v>
<v Speaker 5>line with the rest of the French forces </v>

1717
01:37:51.210 --> 01:37:52.390
<v Speaker 5>that are retreating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sort of all along the line.</v>

1718
01:37:53.110 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the British.</v>

1719
01:37:56.910 --> 01:38:00.600
<v Speaker 5>Now this is a source of contention and </v>
<v Speaker 5>legend like all this stuff.</v>

1720
01:38:00.601 --> 01:38:03.120
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it funny how much of this early </v>
<v Speaker 5>war is,</v>

1721
01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:08.720
<v Speaker 5>but the French had been badgering the </v>
<v Speaker 5>British since the beginning of the war </v>

1722
01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:08.720
<v Speaker 5>to move faster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>move faster,</v>

1723
01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:13.101
<v Speaker 5>move faster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need someone up here on our left </v>

1724
01:38:13.101 --> 01:38:13.101
<v Speaker 5>flank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's critical,</v>

1725
01:38:13.101 --> 01:38:13.101
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The French territorial,</v>

1726
01:38:13.170 --> 01:38:18.170
<v Speaker 5>a units together which are like an old </v>
<v Speaker 5>man and reservists and stuff and put </v>

1727
01:38:18.170 --> 01:38:18.960
<v Speaker 5>them out on the flank just so that </v>
<v Speaker 5>there's something out there,</v>

1728
01:38:18.961 --> 01:38:20.910
<v Speaker 5>but against what's coming.</v>

1729
01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:26.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's nothing and so they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they hurry the British and the British </v>

1730
01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:29.721
<v Speaker 5>rush up and they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they run into Belgium so that they can </v>

1731
01:38:29.721 --> 01:38:30.090
<v Speaker 5>take the position on the left flank and </v>
<v Speaker 5>protect,</v>

1732
01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>poor general [inaudible] army.</v>

1733
01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:35.790
<v Speaker 5>And before they even get their lead </v>
<v Speaker 5>resnick's moving the other direction,</v>

1734
01:38:36.150 --> 01:38:41.150
<v Speaker 5>he's backing up to stay in line with the</v>
<v Speaker 5>French armies exposing the British </v>

1735
01:38:41.150 --> 01:38:42.270
<v Speaker 5>army's flank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again.</v>

1736
01:38:42.450 --> 01:38:47.450
<v Speaker 5>You can read the British historians </v>
<v Speaker 5>who've been mad about that ever since </v>

1737
01:38:47.450 --> 01:38:51.200
<v Speaker 5>being left in the lurch by the French.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's so funny is I read all these </v>

1738
01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:52.710
<v Speaker 5>accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the Irishman's account,</v>

1739
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:57.950
<v Speaker 5>Lucy's account of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of arriving in France and how much the </v>

1740
01:38:57.950 --> 01:39:00.981
<v Speaker 5>French loved them and these wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 5>welcomes and then you read other </v>

1741
01:39:00.981 --> 01:39:01.080
<v Speaker 5>accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know from later in the war where the</v>

1742
01:39:01.081 --> 01:39:01.840
<v Speaker 5>soldiers are going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1743
01:39:01.841 --> 01:39:03.810
<v Speaker 5>the French don't much like us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't like them.</v>

1744
01:39:03.810 --> 01:39:08.810
<v Speaker 5>They don't like us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the leadership in the British army </v>

1745
01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:09.720
<v Speaker 5>didn't seem particularly pro French or </v>
<v Speaker 5>vice versa.</v>

1746
01:39:10.590 --> 01:39:14.370
<v Speaker 5>There seemed to be a lot of arguing </v>
<v Speaker 5>between them and then some weird order.</v>

1747
01:39:14.371 --> 01:39:19.371
<v Speaker 5>Although it's totally understandable by </v>
<v Speaker 5>the head of the British military right </v>

1748
01:39:19.371 --> 01:39:20.610
<v Speaker 5>before the f goes to France,</v>
<v Speaker 5>complicates everything,</v>

1749
01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:24.420
<v Speaker 5>Lord her ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kitchener,</v>

1750
01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:27.360
<v Speaker 5>the British legend from the colonial </v>
<v Speaker 5>wars.</v>

1751
01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:28.770
<v Speaker 5>You've never seen a guy like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by the way.</v>

1752
01:39:28.771 --> 01:39:33.771
<v Speaker 5>I always look at his picture and wonder </v>
<v Speaker 5>what he would look like without that </v>

1753
01:39:33.771 --> 01:39:35.910
<v Speaker 5>Victorian era,</v>
<v Speaker 5>waxed mustache thing he has going.</v>

1754
01:39:35.911 --> 01:39:36.560
<v Speaker 5>But.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he's a.</v>

1755
01:39:36.570 --> 01:39:40.290
<v Speaker 5>he's a fantastic figure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a character in his own right.</v>

1756
01:39:40.650 --> 01:39:42.540
<v Speaker 5>But he famously tells the British </v>
<v Speaker 5>commander,</v>

1757
01:39:42.541 --> 01:39:44.940
<v Speaker 5>who's going over to friend's something </v>
<v Speaker 5>to the effect of,</v>

1758
01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:47.190
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this 70,000</v>

1759
01:39:47.191 --> 01:39:51.780
<v Speaker 5>men is 90 percent of all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have France and Germany.</v>

1760
01:39:51.781 --> 01:39:53.760
<v Speaker 5>They got millions of men in the field.</v>

1761
01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:56.490
<v Speaker 5>This is our army.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't lose it.</v>

1762
01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:59.010
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>be careful.</v>

1763
01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:04.640
<v Speaker 5>The problem is he's in a war where men </v>
<v Speaker 5>are thrown into meat grinders in very </v>

1764
01:40:04.861 --> 01:40:09.861
<v Speaker 5>large numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The French will lose the equivalent of </v>

1765
01:40:09.861 --> 01:40:13.440
<v Speaker 5>the British expeditionary force often in</v>
<v Speaker 5>this war in a short period of time.</v>

1766
01:40:13.441 --> 01:40:18.441
<v Speaker 5>So will the chairman's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the British are moving up into </v>

1767
01:40:18.441 --> 01:40:19.860
<v Speaker 5>Belgium to have their first real contact</v>
<v Speaker 5>with modern war.</v>

1768
01:40:19.861 --> 01:40:24.861
<v Speaker 5>They fought in South Africa against a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch of bore farmers and guerrilla </v>

1769
01:40:25.561 --> 01:40:27.690
<v Speaker 5>fighters got an idea of what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1770
01:40:27.691 --> 01:40:29.550
<v Speaker 5>the rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fire and all that stuff could do.</v>

1771
01:40:29.730 --> 01:40:34.730
<v Speaker 5>They haven't moved up against an army </v>
<v Speaker 5>that can fight like Daikin fight and </v>

1772
01:40:34.730 --> 01:40:38.301
<v Speaker 5>that outnumbers the many times over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They stumble into this army at a place </v>

1773
01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:44.060
<v Speaker 5>called the battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That shaping up will be a legendary </v>

1774
01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:45.450
<v Speaker 5>British battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called the battle of moms.</v>

1775
01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:51.080
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it will be mythologized in a very </v>

1776
01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:54.340
<v Speaker 5>similar way to the dunkirk affair in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Second World War.</v>

1777
01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:58.180
<v Speaker 1>You know what that was right when </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany smashes France in 1940,</v>

1778
01:40:58.450 --> 01:41:00.820
<v Speaker 1>the British managed to evacuate their </v>
<v Speaker 1>army.</v>

1779
01:41:00.821 --> 01:41:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Miraculously every ship that can float </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes across in.</v>

1780
01:41:03.611 --> 01:41:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Every little rowboat comes across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel,</v>

1781
01:41:05.351 --> 01:41:08.170
<v Speaker 1>takes British soldiers away and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Luftwaffe has held at bay.</v>

1782
01:41:08.171 --> 01:41:10.690
<v Speaker 1>And then they can flip the Germans off </v>
<v Speaker 1>from across the English Channel.</v>

1783
01:41:10.691 --> 01:41:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ha ha missed us.</v>

1784
01:41:13.090 --> 01:41:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Technically it's a defeat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1785
01:41:14.591 --> 01:41:19.591
<v Speaker 1>But you sort of a it and spin it in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that makes it look like a glorious </v>

1786
01:41:19.591 --> 01:41:20.640
<v Speaker 1>victory that ends up biting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1787
01:41:20.650 --> 01:41:22.150
<v Speaker 1>the enemy in the rear end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the long run.</v>

1788
01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:23.500
<v Speaker 1>There is some truth to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1789
01:41:23.501 --> 01:41:25.630
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can work with that as the publicists</v>

1790
01:41:25.631 --> 01:41:28.660
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the battle of Mons is very similar.</v>

1791
01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:31.690
<v Speaker 1>One of those things that's technically </v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how you look at it,</v>

1792
01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:37.020
<v Speaker 1>a defeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are heroic narratives that </v>

1793
01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:37.840
<v Speaker 1>sort of come out of it.</v>

1794
01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:43.140
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the moment where the cloaking </v>

1795
01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:45.541
<v Speaker 1>device is removed from the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>flanking attack because up till now </v>

1796
01:41:45.541 --> 01:41:49.831
<v Speaker 1>there's been this uncertainty about is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it coming in and what strength is it </v>

1797
01:41:49.831 --> 01:41:53.641
<v Speaker 1>coming in and how many men are we </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about here in where exactly is </v>

1798
01:41:53.641 --> 01:41:53.641
<v Speaker 1>it going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these different kinds of things that</v>

1799
01:41:53.641 --> 01:41:58.411
<v Speaker 1>British run in to the tip of the spear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They run into the most honored,</v>

1800
01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:03.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the armies that are involved in this </v>

1801
01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:03.880
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one that has the,</v>

1802
01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:05.860
<v Speaker 1>the important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most important position.</v>

1803
01:42:05.861 --> 01:42:10.861
<v Speaker 1>The one that the great schlieffen </v>
<v Speaker 1>famously said that these guys should </v>

1804
01:42:10.861 --> 01:42:12.520
<v Speaker 1>brush their sleeves against the English </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel,</v>

1805
01:42:12.521 --> 01:42:17.521
<v Speaker 1>meaning that that's how wide a flanking </v>
<v Speaker 1>maneuver they should make through </v>

1806
01:42:17.521 --> 01:42:20.971
<v Speaker 1>Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should make it so wide that they </v>

1807
01:42:20.971 --> 01:42:20.971
<v Speaker 1>actually almost touched the last man on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right,</v>

1808
01:42:20.971 --> 01:42:25.230
<v Speaker 1>touches a sleeve into the water and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>commanded by one of these great German </v>

1809
01:42:26.111 --> 01:42:31.111
<v Speaker 1>generals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy named Alexander von and </v>

1810
01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:36.520
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is one of these guys that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Hind Scuderi and I think I said in </v>

1811
01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:37.720
<v Speaker 1>the Second World War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an aggressive general.</v>

1812
01:42:37.721 --> 01:42:41.020
<v Speaker 1>He's a hard driver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seizes the initiative.</v>

1813
01:42:41.021 --> 01:42:44.500
<v Speaker 1>He gets you off balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He keeps pushing and he moves.</v>

1814
01:42:44.501 --> 01:42:49.501
<v Speaker 1>It's all about speed and deadliness when</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets to the place where you don't </v>

1815
01:42:49.501 --> 01:42:49.501
<v Speaker 1>expect him yet,</v>

1816
01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:55.800
<v Speaker 1>he's commanding 320,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>men in Germany's first army right next </v>

1817
01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:58.420
<v Speaker 1>to him as Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second army also moving through Belgium.</v>

1818
01:42:58.421 --> 01:43:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Also part of this outflanking maneuver </v>
<v Speaker 1>to 160,000</v>

1819
01:43:01.751 --> 01:43:06.751
<v Speaker 1>men under von Bulow on housing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Third Army below him as 180,000</v>

1820
01:43:07.991 --> 01:43:09.850
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the flanking maneuver.</v>

1821
01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:14.140
<v Speaker 1>The British run into the German army on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the farthest right flank.</v>

1822
01:43:14.141 --> 01:43:15.940
<v Speaker 1>They only run into a part of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

1823
01:43:15.941 --> 01:43:20.941
<v Speaker 1>but 160,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>men who are surprised to find the </v>

1824
01:43:20.941 --> 01:43:24.661
<v Speaker 1>British waiting for them behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>defensive positions along 25 miles of a </v>

1825
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:30.850
<v Speaker 1>canal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we call a defensive obstacle,</v>

1826
01:43:30.851 --> 01:43:35.851
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that magnifies the </v>

1827
01:43:35.851 --> 01:43:38.611
<v Speaker 1>power of the defense because now the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans have to cross this canal under </v>

1828
01:43:38.611 --> 01:43:42.331
<v Speaker 1>fire and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the British think they're going to </v>

1829
01:43:42.331 --> 01:43:46.021
<v Speaker 1>face a core of Germans maybe to instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're facing four plus cores and </v>

1830
01:43:49.391 --> 01:43:52.460
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it in this kind of another</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldly setting.</v>

1831
01:43:52.690 --> 01:43:53.420
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

1832
01:43:53.421 --> 01:43:54.920
<v Speaker 5>Barbara Tuchman's good for this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

1833
01:43:54.921 --> 01:43:56.420
<v Speaker 5>And she explains that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1834
01:43:56.421 --> 01:44:01.421
<v Speaker 5>you might think that this is like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>wonderful Belgian farm countryside in </v>

1835
01:44:01.421 --> 01:44:02.600
<v Speaker 5>the canal with blue water going through </v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

1836
01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:07.830
<v Speaker 5>But she explains that this is a mining </v>
<v Speaker 5>town and the water that runs through </v>

1837
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:10.970
<v Speaker 5>this canal is more of a sludge and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>black and it gives off chemical fumes.</v>

1838
01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:16.240
<v Speaker 5>And she said it amongst the flower </v>
<v Speaker 5>gardens and vegetable gardens are these </v>

1839
01:44:16.240 --> 01:44:19.580
<v Speaker 5>slag heaps that are pointed and looked </v>
<v Speaker 5>like tall witches hats all around the,</v>

1840
01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:24.790
<v Speaker 5>the landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and she says it doesn't look like a bad </v>

1841
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:26.300
<v Speaker 5>place for a modern battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's gone down in history though,</v>

1842
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:28.100
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with one narrative.</v>

1843
01:44:28.101 --> 01:44:33.101
<v Speaker 5>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as in everything else you're going to </v>

1844
01:44:33.101 --> 01:44:33.101
<v Speaker 5>get tired of me saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But as everything else with this war,</v>

1845
01:44:33.101 --> 01:44:33.710
<v Speaker 5>there's a whole nother counter </v>
<v Speaker 5>narrative.</v>

1846
01:44:34.010 --> 01:44:36.390
<v Speaker 5>The original narrative is the dunkirk </v>
<v Speaker 5>one that,</v>

1847
01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:41.440
<v Speaker 5>that turns this thing into something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is so legendary that within a year </v>

1848
01:44:42.890 --> 01:44:46.160
<v Speaker 5>or two legends,</v>
<v Speaker 5>popular legends will spring up.</v>

1849
01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:50.720
<v Speaker 5>That there are angels on the British </v>
<v Speaker 5>side of this battle,</v>

1850
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.730
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1851
01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:57.970
<v Speaker 5>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't push that rumor because even </v>

1852
01:44:57.970 --> 01:44:58.460
<v Speaker 5>though it makes it look like God might </v>
<v Speaker 5>be on your side if you've got the angels</v>

1853
01:44:58.461 --> 01:45:03.461
<v Speaker 5>on your side and you still end up having</v>
<v Speaker 5>to move backwards in retreat after the </v>

1854
01:45:03.461 --> 01:45:07.031
<v Speaker 5>battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't speak too well about the </v>

1855
01:45:07.031 --> 01:45:07.031
<v Speaker 5>fighting power of the particular angels </v>
<v Speaker 5>involved.</v>

1856
01:45:07.031 --> 01:45:07.760
<v Speaker 5>But let's not go there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's talk about,</v>

1857
01:45:08.140 --> 01:45:13.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the parts we can confirm about this </v>

1858
01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:14.120
<v Speaker 5>battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a 25 mile front that these 70,000</v>

1859
01:45:14.121 --> 01:45:17.210
<v Speaker 5>guys have to hold most of it behind this</v>
<v Speaker 5>canal as we said,</v>

1860
01:45:18.170 --> 01:45:23.170
<v Speaker 5>and it starts with encounters between </v>
<v Speaker 5>cavalry because remember they're trying </v>

1861
01:45:23.170 --> 01:45:27.611
<v Speaker 5>to use these aircraft and and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the Germans are better than most </v>

1862
01:45:27.611 --> 01:45:30.880
<v Speaker 5>adults to look at things and see things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but every time anything's misty or </v>

1863
01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:35.141
<v Speaker 5>foggy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can't see anything from these </v>

1864
01:45:35.141 --> 01:45:35.141
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

1865
01:45:35.141 --> 01:45:37.870
<v Speaker 5>So it's still cavalry that does this job</v>
<v Speaker 5>and while you're cavalry's out front </v>

1866
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:39.410
<v Speaker 5>trying to be the eyes and ears of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>army,</v>

1867
01:45:39.411 --> 01:45:42.500
<v Speaker 5>the enemy's cavalry is out front being </v>
<v Speaker 5>the eyes and ears of their army and they</v>

1868
01:45:42.501 --> 01:45:44.990
<v Speaker 5>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what you normally have.</v>

1869
01:45:44.991 --> 01:45:48.590
<v Speaker 5>Your reconnaissance forces get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the first stuff that goes on here</v>

1870
01:45:48.591 --> 01:45:51.190
<v Speaker 5>is the British eyes and ears and counter</v>
<v Speaker 5>the German eyes and ears.</v>

1871
01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:56.290
<v Speaker 5>There's some cavalry skirmishes and John</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lucy or are Irishman in the BDF talks </v>

1872
01:45:57.561 --> 01:45:58.280
<v Speaker 5>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

1873
01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:00.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we run into are cavalry and there's some</v>

1874
01:46:00.171 --> 01:46:01.180
<v Speaker 5>wounded people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they,</v>

1875
01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:06.350
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they beat the Germans at a little </v>

1876
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:07.901
<v Speaker 5>cavalier engagement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the Germans are coming and so the </v>

1877
01:46:07.901 --> 01:46:10.760
<v Speaker 5>British and his unit all get ready.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The they kind of scratch them out.</v>

1878
01:46:10.761 --> 01:46:13.130
<v Speaker 5>Dig would be too strong of a word </v>
<v Speaker 5>scratch themselves out,</v>

1879
01:46:13.131 --> 01:46:18.131
<v Speaker 5>a little depression in the soil and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait for the Germans to arrive and I </v>

1880
01:46:18.131 --> 01:46:21.020
<v Speaker 5>should point out something that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm estimating here,</v>

1881
01:46:21.021 --> 01:46:26.021
<v Speaker 5>but I would say between 85 and 90 </v>
<v Speaker 5>percent of all the accounts you read </v>

1882
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:31.030
<v Speaker 5>from soldiers going off to war in 1914,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it doesn't matter which army you </v>

1883
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.340
<v Speaker 5>choose.</v>

1884
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:36.550
<v Speaker 5>Most of it is overwhelmingly positive in</v>
<v Speaker 5>terms of the emotion that these young </v>

1885
01:46:37.191 --> 01:46:39.830
<v Speaker 5>men feel going off to war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

1886
01:46:39.831 --> 01:46:44.831
<v Speaker 5>there were some Russian accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially when you know people are </v>

1887
01:46:44.831 --> 01:46:44.831
<v Speaker 5>pulled off of farms and don't want to go</v>
<v Speaker 5>do this,</v>

1888
01:46:44.831 --> 01:46:47.990
<v Speaker 5>but most of the young men going off to </v>
<v Speaker 5>war here are excited.</v>

1889
01:46:47.991 --> 01:46:52.140
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like an adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Full Romance of war is still in bloom to</v>

1890
01:46:52.141 --> 01:46:53.790
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is excitement.</v>

1891
01:46:53.791 --> 01:46:55.530
<v Speaker 5>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of these people have pretty dreary</v>

1892
01:46:55.531 --> 01:46:57.380
<v Speaker 5>lives and now all of a sudden they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>caught up in,</v>

1893
01:46:57.550 --> 01:46:59.790
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in world affairs that are huge,</v>

1894
01:46:59.791 --> 01:47:04.791
<v Speaker 5>momentous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>biggest thing that's ever going to </v>

1895
01:47:04.791 --> 01:47:04.791
<v Speaker 5>happen to most of these people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

1896
01:47:04.791 --> 01:47:05.220
<v Speaker 5>and they know it and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're caught up in the excitement that</v>

1897
01:47:05.221 --> 01:47:10.221
<v Speaker 5>they don't have a lot of negative </v>
<v Speaker 5>stories yet that have filtered into the </v>

1898
01:47:10.221 --> 01:47:10.221
<v Speaker 5>public realm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1899
01:47:10.221 --> 01:47:11.640
<v Speaker 5>explaining what's happened to the guys </v>
<v Speaker 5>who came before you because there are no</v>

1900
01:47:11.641 --> 01:47:15.000
<v Speaker 5>guys that came before you are Irish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>British,</v>

1901
01:47:15.001 --> 01:47:20.001
<v Speaker 5>Expeditionary Force soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>John Lucy is moving up towards malls in </v>

1902
01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:23.730
<v Speaker 5>the period right around August 22nd,</v>
<v Speaker 5>August,</v>

1903
01:47:23.731 --> 01:47:28.710
<v Speaker 5>23rd and says that when he first heard </v>
<v Speaker 5>the guns,</v>

1904
01:47:29.370 --> 01:47:34.370
<v Speaker 5>it was a queer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>thrilling sort of feeling that it </v>

1905
01:47:34.370 --> 01:47:38.961
<v Speaker 5>brought on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it also worried him but maybe not </v>

1906
01:47:38.961 --> 01:47:42.591
<v Speaker 5>for the reason we would think of as an </v>
<v Speaker 5>adventurous young man who finds all </v>

1907
01:47:42.591 --> 01:47:42.890
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1908
01:47:42.990 --> 01:47:44.100
<v Speaker 5>interesting and exciting.</v>

1909
01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:48.690
<v Speaker 5>He had a different reason to be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He writes about his unit as he comes up,</v>

1910
01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:52.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>toward the situation at models like this</v>

1911
01:47:53.610 --> 01:47:58.610
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we swapped news with the nearest men in </v>

1912
01:47:58.610 --> 01:48:01.671
<v Speaker 5>the ranks and learn that nothing </v>
<v Speaker 5>exciting had happened to the battalion </v>

1913
01:48:01.671 --> 01:48:04.611
<v Speaker 5>in our absence,</v>
<v Speaker 5>except that a line of trenches had been </v>

1914
01:48:04.611 --> 01:48:07.221
<v Speaker 5>dug as a defensive measure about a mile </v>
<v Speaker 5>behind and then abandoned on the orders </v>

1915
01:48:07.221 --> 01:48:11.871
<v Speaker 5>of a staff officer who wish the </v>
<v Speaker 5>battalion to move forward toward the </v>

1916
01:48:11.871 --> 01:48:13.050
<v Speaker 5>town of Maus now visible through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>slag,</v>

1917
01:48:13.051 --> 01:48:16.440
<v Speaker 5>heaps of many minds on the right front </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the marching regimen.</v>

1918
01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:21.740
<v Speaker 5>This dirty looking factory town had no </v>
<v Speaker 5>particular interest just then for us </v>

1919
01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:24.480
<v Speaker 5>until suddenly above the sound of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>tread of our marching feet.</v>

1920
01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:27.720
<v Speaker 5>We heard the blooming of field guns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a queer,</v>

1921
01:48:27.721 --> 01:48:32.721
<v Speaker 5>thrilling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and menacing sound about which there </v>

1922
01:48:32.721 --> 01:48:35.331
<v Speaker 5>were many conjectures,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the most popular being that they were </v>

1923
01:48:35.331 --> 01:48:38.331
<v Speaker 5>French,</v>
<v Speaker 5>70 fives and that they were giving the </v>

1924
01:48:38.331 --> 01:48:38.331
<v Speaker 5>Germans hell.</v>

1925
01:48:38.331 --> 01:48:40.530
<v Speaker 5>This notion greatly depressed us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We should really hurry up now.</v>

1926
01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:44.310
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise we would miss the battle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The French would get all the glory while</v>

1927
01:48:44.311 --> 01:48:47.840
<v Speaker 5>we with our capacity for deadly rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fire and dash,</v>

1928
01:48:47.841 --> 01:48:52.841
<v Speaker 5>and the attack would miss that crowning </v>
<v Speaker 5>moment of victory culminating in a </v>

1929
01:48:52.841 --> 01:48:53.460
<v Speaker 5>sweeping,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bayonet charge,</v>

1930
01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:58.580
<v Speaker 5>relentless and invincible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the grand assault that would drive the </v>

1931
01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:01.260
<v Speaker 5>enemy off the field so we dammed the </v>
<v Speaker 5>French were not waiting for us.</v>

1932
01:49:02.540 --> 01:49:07.200
<v Speaker 5>And to quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's that romance of war again,</v>

1933
01:49:07.590 --> 01:49:09.600
<v Speaker 5>the great adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be fun.</v>

1934
01:49:09.930 --> 01:49:13.470
<v Speaker 5>We're going to be heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's funny when he first gets to the</v>

1935
01:49:13.471 --> 01:49:18.471
<v Speaker 5>line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he and his men take up positions and </v>

1936
01:49:18.471 --> 01:49:21.741
<v Speaker 5>what they call knee trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These shallow little kind of holes and </v>

1937
01:49:21.741 --> 01:49:23.070
<v Speaker 5>they're not too happy to not be moving </v>
<v Speaker 5>forward and doing something offensive,</v>

1938
01:49:23.071 --> 01:49:28.071
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they sit down there and then the </v>

1939
01:49:28.071 --> 01:49:29.631
<v Speaker 5>first shells come by them and again they</v>
<v Speaker 5>find it more interesting and they kind </v>

1940
01:49:29.731 --> 01:49:30.990
<v Speaker 5>of have fun with it.</v>

1941
01:49:31.530 --> 01:49:32.250
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

1942
01:49:32.790 --> 01:49:37.790
<v Speaker 5>the salvo of shells passed over our </v>
<v Speaker 5>heads and burst about 80 yards in the </v>

1943
01:49:37.790 --> 01:49:41.250
<v Speaker 5>rear with a terrific clattering crash.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were highly interested,</v>

1944
01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:46.460
<v Speaker 5>more came and still more all going over </v>
<v Speaker 5>the heads of our curious men appeared </v>

1945
01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:48.520
<v Speaker 5>above the trenches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Looking back to see the burst,</v>

1946
01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:52.960
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they shouted a black one or one only,</v>

1947
01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:58.200
<v Speaker 5>or for more whites,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some laughingly imagine themselves on </v>

1948
01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:02.110
<v Speaker 5>duty at rifle ranges at home and shouted</v>
<v Speaker 5>advice to the German gunners,</v>

1949
01:50:02.250 --> 01:50:06.580
<v Speaker 5>wash out another miss and lower your </v>
<v Speaker 5>sights.</v>

1950
01:50:06.910 --> 01:50:09.880
<v Speaker 5>One wag simulating great terror,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cried,</v>

1951
01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:14.940
<v Speaker 5>send for the police.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be a row on here and </v>

1952
01:50:14.940 --> 01:50:15.160
<v Speaker 5>another in mock despair.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh mother,</v>

1953
01:50:15.161 --> 01:50:19.030
<v Speaker 5>why did I desert you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Than the enemy gunners shortened and the</v>

1954
01:50:19.031 --> 01:50:24.031
<v Speaker 5>shell is exploded above our trenches and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the men already taken in hand for </v>

1955
01:50:24.031 --> 01:50:25.780
<v Speaker 5>exposing themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Crouched low.</v>

1956
01:50:26.770 --> 01:50:28.690
<v Speaker 5>So it's getting real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1957
01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:33.430
<v Speaker 5>But it shows you the attitude that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>had at the time they are having fun with</v>

1958
01:50:33.431 --> 01:50:35.260
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a great adventure.</v>

1959
01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:39.880
<v Speaker 5>And you read accounts from every major </v>
<v Speaker 5>army of this period.</v>

1960
01:50:39.881 --> 01:50:44.881
<v Speaker 5>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Russians have a little bit more </v>

1961
01:50:44.881 --> 01:50:44.881
<v Speaker 5>people that were sort of dragged into </v>
<v Speaker 5>this kicking and screaming.</v>

1962
01:50:44.881 --> 01:50:45.090
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

1963
01:50:45.091 --> 01:50:47.680
<v Speaker 5>and the country people always more than </v>
<v Speaker 5>the urban people,</v>

1964
01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:51.010
<v Speaker 5>but the 20 year olds who are marching </v>
<v Speaker 5>off to do this,</v>

1965
01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:54.280
<v Speaker 5>it's hard to find accounts where they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>dreading it.</v>

1966
01:50:54.281 --> 01:50:57.010
<v Speaker 5>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there'll be accounts down the road where</v>

1967
01:50:57.610 --> 01:51:02.610
<v Speaker 5>you know everyone has a good idea where </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going and there's a lot more of </v>

1968
01:51:02.610 --> 01:51:04.420
<v Speaker 5>planning for your own death and worrying</v>
<v Speaker 5>about that kind of stuff.</v>

1969
01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:05.620
<v Speaker 5>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as I said,</v>

1970
01:51:05.621 --> 01:51:08.350
<v Speaker 5>John Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lucy's worrying about missing the fun.</v>

1971
01:51:09.550 --> 01:51:11.650
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't have to worry because the </v>
<v Speaker 5>funds come into him.</v>

1972
01:51:13.470 --> 01:51:17.190
<v Speaker 5>Field Marshal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alexander von Cluck is aiming the German</v>

1973
01:51:17.191 --> 01:51:19.710
<v Speaker 5>first army,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tip of the spear,</v>

1974
01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:21.000
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Adam</v>

1975
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:26.330
<v Speaker 5>and Alexander von cluck is like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>German general,</v>

1976
01:51:26.331 --> 01:51:31.331
<v Speaker 5>that central casting in the TV Hollywood</v>
<v Speaker 5>world would've put together scarred </v>

1977
01:51:31.641 --> 01:51:33.350
<v Speaker 5>face,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1978
01:51:33.351 --> 01:51:38.351
<v Speaker 5>iron cross carrying a soldier's rifle </v>
<v Speaker 5>and a pistol at the same time while he's</v>

1979
01:51:38.901 --> 01:51:43.901
<v Speaker 5>walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fearsome is a great description of him </v>

1980
01:51:43.901 --> 01:51:45.470
<v Speaker 5>where a French observer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1981
01:51:45.471 --> 01:51:48.890
<v Speaker 5>during the early stages of this combat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know right around now,</v>

1982
01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:54.220
<v Speaker 5>ends up witnessing the arrival of von </v>
<v Speaker 5>cluck somewhere and says it reminded </v>

1983
01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:55.610
<v Speaker 5>them of Attila the Hun.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he said,</v>

1984
01:51:55.611 --> 01:51:58.730
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an automobile drove up from it,</v>

1985
01:51:58.731 --> 01:52:03.731
<v Speaker 5>descended it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an officer of arrogant and impressive </v>

1986
01:52:03.731 --> 01:52:06.341
<v Speaker 5>bearing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He stopped forward alone while the </v>

1987
01:52:06.341 --> 01:52:07.040
<v Speaker 5>officers standing in groups in front of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the villa made way for him.</v>

1988
01:52:07.310 --> 01:52:11.570
<v Speaker 5>He was tall and majestic with a scarred </v>
<v Speaker 5>clean shaven face,</v>

1989
01:52:11.690 --> 01:52:15.140
<v Speaker 5>hard features in a frightening glance in</v>
<v Speaker 5>his right hand.</v>

1990
01:52:15.141 --> 01:52:19.280
<v Speaker 5>He carried a soldier's rifle and his </v>
<v Speaker 5>left rested on the butt of a revolver.</v>

1991
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:24.430
<v Speaker 5>He turned around several times striking </v>
<v Speaker 5>the ground with the butt end of his </v>

1992
01:52:24.430 --> 01:52:25.850
<v Speaker 5>rifle and then halted in a theatrical </v>
<v Speaker 5>pose.</v>

1993
01:52:26.090 --> 01:52:31.090
<v Speaker 5>No one seemed to dare to approach him </v>
<v Speaker 5>and indeed he wore a terrible air and to</v>

1994
01:52:31.470 --> 01:52:33.770
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and as we said earlier,</v>

1995
01:52:33.771 --> 01:52:38.771
<v Speaker 5>he's like the Hind Scuderi of this war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's the hard driving impetuses.</v>

1996
01:52:38.811 --> 01:52:42.290
<v Speaker 5>Everything commanding 320,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>men,</v>

1997
01:52:42.291 --> 01:52:47.291
<v Speaker 5>commander of the first army and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to have with German generals who </v>

1998
01:52:47.291 --> 01:52:49.850
<v Speaker 5>are not as aggressive and hard driving </v>
<v Speaker 5>as he is.</v>

1999
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:52.490
<v Speaker 5>It's his army.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2000
01:52:52.580 --> 01:52:57.580
<v Speaker 5>about half of it that will run into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>British at mom's and the traditional </v>

2001
01:52:58.281 --> 01:53:02.870
<v Speaker 5>story is that they're in for a shock </v>
<v Speaker 5>because as we said earlier,</v>

2002
01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:05.810
<v Speaker 5>the British are good rifleman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but even this,</v>

2003
01:53:05.811 --> 01:53:09.380
<v Speaker 5>just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even this is contested in a second.</v>

2004
01:53:09.381 --> 01:53:14.381
<v Speaker 5>I'll read some stuff about this same </v>
<v Speaker 5>battle from the military historian of </v>

2005
01:53:14.381 --> 01:53:17.800
<v Speaker 5>Britain's imperial war museum who will </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of go after every single point </v>

2006
01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:22.331
<v Speaker 5>that's traditional in this narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but traditionally Alexander von </v>

2007
01:53:22.331 --> 01:53:24.590
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] forces in sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 5>encounter battle,</v>

2008
01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:29.740
<v Speaker 5>stumble in to the British lines and take</v>
<v Speaker 5>it on the Chin and are hit by so much </v>

2009
01:53:30.621 --> 01:53:34.310
<v Speaker 5>rifle fire that is so precisely aimed </v>
<v Speaker 5>and so quickly,</v>

2010
01:53:34.780 --> 01:53:39.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fired that the German supposedly think </v>

2011
01:53:39.780 --> 01:53:39.780
<v Speaker 5>they're under machine gun fire.</v>

2012
01:53:39.780 --> 01:53:43.750
<v Speaker 5>John Lucy's very proud of this moment </v>
<v Speaker 5>and describes what happens to the </v>

2013
01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:45.560
<v Speaker 5>Germans thusly quote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Finally,</v>

2014
01:53:45.561 --> 01:53:50.561
<v Speaker 5>the shelling ceased and we put up our </v>
<v Speaker 5>heads to breathe more freely than we </v>

2015
01:53:50.561 --> 01:53:52.100
<v Speaker 5>heard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Conch like sounds strange.</v>

2016
01:53:52.101 --> 01:53:54.530
<v Speaker 5>Bugle calls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The German infantry,</v>

2017
01:53:54.590 --> 01:53:58.220
<v Speaker 5>which had approached during the shelling</v>
<v Speaker 5>was insight and about to attack us.</v>

2018
01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:01.310
<v Speaker 5>Not a shot had been fired from our </v>
<v Speaker 5>trenches up till now,</v>

2019
01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:05.480
<v Speaker 5>and the only opposition to the Germans </v>
<v Speaker 5>had been made by our field gun battery,</v>

2020
01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:10.600
<v Speaker 5>which was heavily engaged behind us and </v>
<v Speaker 5>making almost as much clamor as the </v>

2021
01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:11.060
<v Speaker 5>enemy shelling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To my mind,</v>

2022
01:54:11.061 --> 01:54:16.061
<v Speaker 5>it seemed that the whole battalion must </v>
<v Speaker 5>have been wiped out by that dreadful </v>

2023
01:54:16.061 --> 01:54:17.330
<v Speaker 5>reign of shells,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but apparently not an answer.</v>

2024
01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:20.420
<v Speaker 5>He writes to the German bugles are </v>
<v Speaker 5>trumpets came,</v>

2025
01:54:20.421 --> 01:54:23.510
<v Speaker 5>the cheerful sound of our officers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whistles and the rifleman.</v>

2026
01:54:23.630 --> 01:54:27.770
<v Speaker 5>Casting aside the amazement of their </v>
<v Speaker 5>strange trial sprang to action,</v>

2027
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:33.550
<v Speaker 5>a great roar of musketry rent the air </v>
<v Speaker 5>varying slightly in intensity from </v>

2028
01:54:33.550 --> 01:54:37.040
<v Speaker 5>minute to minute as whole company ceased</v>
<v Speaker 5>fire and opened again.</v>

2029
01:54:37.250 --> 01:54:42.250
<v Speaker 5>The satisfactory sharp blasts of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>directing whistles showed that our </v>

2030
01:54:42.250 --> 01:54:46.211
<v Speaker 5>machinery of defense was working like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the drill book and that the recent </v>

2031
01:54:46.211 --> 01:54:48.770
<v Speaker 5>shelling had caused no disorganization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The clatter of our machine guns added to</v>

2032
01:54:48.771 --> 01:54:50.930
<v Speaker 5>the den for us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He writes,</v>

2033
01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:54.290
<v Speaker 5>the battle took the form of well ordered</v>
<v Speaker 5>rapid rifle,</v>

2034
01:54:54.291 --> 01:54:59.291
<v Speaker 5>fire at close range as the field gray.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Human targets appeared or were struck </v>

2035
01:54:59.291 --> 01:55:04.181
<v Speaker 5>down the enemy infantry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>advanced according to one of our men in </v>

2036
01:55:04.181 --> 01:55:08.441
<v Speaker 5>columns of masses which withered away </v>
<v Speaker 5>under the galling fire of the well </v>

2037
01:55:08.541 --> 01:55:13.541
<v Speaker 5>trained and Cooley lead Irishman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the leading Germans fired standing from </v>

2038
01:55:13.541 --> 01:55:15.470
<v Speaker 5>the hip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me interrupt him here.</v>

2039
01:55:15.471 --> 01:55:18.110
<v Speaker 5>Now that's John Wayne style walking </v>
<v Speaker 5>toward the enemy.</v>

2040
01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:23.350
<v Speaker 5>Shooting from your hip,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they're coming toward the British </v>

2041
01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:25.100
<v Speaker 5>trenches doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The leading Germans,</v>

2042
01:55:25.220 --> 01:55:28.430
<v Speaker 5>as he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fired standing from the hip as they came</v>

2043
01:55:28.431 --> 01:55:29.690
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're scattered.</v>

2044
01:55:29.691 --> 01:55:31.430
<v Speaker 5>Fire was ineffective and ignored.</v>

2045
01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:34.580
<v Speaker 5>They crumbled up mown down as quickly as</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tell it.</v>

2046
01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:39.820
<v Speaker 5>They're reinforcing waves in sections </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming on bravely and steadily to fall </v>

2047
01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:43.560
<v Speaker 5>over as they reached the front line of </v>
<v Speaker 5>slain and wounded behind the death line,</v>

2048
01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:47.460
<v Speaker 5>thicker converging columns were being </v>
<v Speaker 5>blown about by our field guns.</v>

2049
01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:52.320
<v Speaker 5>He then says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our rapid fire was appalling even to us,</v>

2050
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:57.470
<v Speaker 5>and the worst marksman could not miss as</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had only to fire into the Brown of </v>

2051
01:55:57.470 --> 01:56:00.510
<v Speaker 5>the masses of the unfortunate enemy who </v>
<v Speaker 5>won the fronts of two of our companies.</v>

2052
01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:05.660
<v Speaker 5>We're continually and uselessly </v>
<v Speaker 5>reinforced at the short range of 300 </v>

2053
01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:06.750
<v Speaker 5>yards.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Such tactics amazed us,</v>

2054
01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:11.900
<v Speaker 5>and after the first shock of seeing men </v>
<v Speaker 5>slowly and helplessly falling down as </v>

2055
01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:15.441
<v Speaker 5>they were hit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gave us a great sense of power and </v>

2056
01:56:15.441 --> 01:56:15.441
<v Speaker 5>pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was also easy.</v>

2057
01:56:16.530 --> 01:56:18.930
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the German attack had to be broken off.</v>

2058
01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:23.960
<v Speaker 5>Quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the German survivors began to go back </v>

2059
01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:24.900
<v Speaker 5>here and there from align the attack had</v>
<v Speaker 5>been an utter failure.</v>

2060
01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:30.060
<v Speaker 5>Soon all that remained was the long line</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the dead heaped before us motionless </v>

2061
01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:33.270
<v Speaker 5>except for the limb movements of some of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the wounded and quote</v>

2062
01:56:35.070 --> 01:56:37.050
<v Speaker 5>as a person interested in military </v>
<v Speaker 5>history,</v>

2063
01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:42.680
<v Speaker 5>this era of the conflict is the one most</v>
<v Speaker 5>interesting to me because you know later</v>

2064
01:56:42.961 --> 01:56:45.540
<v Speaker 5>in the war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's pretty experienced,</v>

2065
01:56:45.780 --> 01:56:47.130
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with what you're dealing with.</v>

2066
01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:52.400
<v Speaker 5>It's at this point in the war that </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's learning the reality of </v>

2067
01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:54.570
<v Speaker 5>modern warfare at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>through bloody hard experience.</v>

2068
01:56:54.571 --> 01:56:59.571
<v Speaker 5>The British expeditionary force and von </v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] First Army are both kind of </v>

2069
01:56:59.571 --> 01:57:02.670
<v Speaker 5>getting a real initial taste of what the</v>
<v Speaker 5>new weaponry can do.</v>

2070
01:57:02.671 --> 01:57:06.690
<v Speaker 5>And as you heard from John Lucy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Irish rifleman in the BDF,</v>

2071
01:57:06.990 --> 01:57:11.990
<v Speaker 5>he and his compatriots were actually </v>
<v Speaker 5>appalled at how effective and deadly it </v>

2072
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:11.990
<v Speaker 5>was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a whole different thing,</v>

2073
01:57:12.330 --> 01:57:17.330
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>firing it live people than a parade </v>

2074
01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:18.150
<v Speaker 5>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you happen to emerge unscathed,</v>

2075
01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:23.070
<v Speaker 5>it almost seems to bolster that idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>that this is fun,</v>

2076
01:57:23.071 --> 01:57:24.240
<v Speaker 5>heroic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>romantic.</v>

2077
01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:29.660
<v Speaker 5>I'm Lynn Mcdonald in her book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>1914 quotes a bunch of people who were </v>

2078
01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:30.090
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including Lieutenant Chapman,</v>

2079
01:57:30.330 --> 01:57:33.390
<v Speaker 5>who as the British are dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>battle,</v>

2080
01:57:33.391 --> 01:57:38.391
<v Speaker 5>tells what's going on to a compatriot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>his and says about the repulsing of the </v>

2081
01:57:38.971 --> 01:57:40.530
<v Speaker 5>German human wave attacks.</v>

2082
01:57:40.530 --> 01:57:45.530
<v Speaker 5>Quote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They came at us over a bank directly in </v>

2083
01:57:45.530 --> 01:57:45.810
<v Speaker 5>front of us and as soon as they topped </v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2084
01:57:45.870 --> 01:57:48.480
<v Speaker 5>we let them have it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The range was 70 yards,</v>

2085
01:57:48.481 --> 01:57:50.340
<v Speaker 5>so we were firing at them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Point blank.</v>

2086
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:52.560
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen anything like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Legs,</v>

2087
01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:53.550
<v Speaker 5>arms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>heads.</v>

2088
01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:57.150
<v Speaker 5>They were flying all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We absolutely smashed them.</v>

2089
01:57:57.270 --> 01:58:00.900
<v Speaker 5>They simply melted away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the blighters got some machine guns</v>

2090
01:58:00.901 --> 01:58:03.390
<v Speaker 5>into action and at that distance we were</v>
<v Speaker 5>like sitting ducks.</v>

2091
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:06.660
<v Speaker 5>So we had to get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And by Jove it was a close shave.</v>

2092
01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:12.240
<v Speaker 5>And to quote as though it's a fun story,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2093
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:16.560
<v Speaker 5>There was a 16 year old trumpeter and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not unusual.</v>

2094
01:58:16.561 --> 01:58:19.500
<v Speaker 5>Going back a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They always would have boys,</v>

2095
01:58:19.890 --> 01:58:20.910
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2096
01:58:20.911 --> 01:58:23.400
<v Speaker 5>as drummers and trumpeters and on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ships they'll have,</v>

2097
01:58:23.550 --> 01:58:25.110
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they actually have a position in,</v>

2098
01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:28.230
<v Speaker 5>in Britain's navy called first boy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>second boy,</v>

2099
01:58:28.470 --> 01:58:29.610
<v Speaker 5>and they are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're kids,</v>

2100
01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:34.910
<v Speaker 5>but a 16 year old British trumpeter at </v>
<v Speaker 5>Moz describes how he just admired what </v>

2101
01:58:35.701 --> 01:58:36.510
<v Speaker 5>the British were doing.</v>

2102
01:58:36.510 --> 01:58:37.110
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2103
01:58:37.170 --> 01:58:39.930
<v Speaker 5>He never forgot the fire discipline of </v>
<v Speaker 5>these rifleman.</v>

2104
01:58:40.260 --> 01:58:45.260
<v Speaker 5>He says he was sitting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>watching an officer countdown the range </v>

2105
01:58:45.260 --> 01:58:48.421
<v Speaker 5>of this advancing gray human wave and </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting very nervous as it got closer </v>

2106
01:58:48.421 --> 01:58:52.651
<v Speaker 5>and closer and closer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was saying that the British </v>

2107
01:58:52.651 --> 01:58:56.160
<v Speaker 5>officer was holding the rifle fire until</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Germans got really close and he was </v>

2108
01:58:56.261 --> 01:59:01.261
<v Speaker 5>counting down the range.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trumpeter j Dot Naylor from the third </v>

2109
01:59:01.261 --> 01:59:04.300
<v Speaker 5>division reports quote he was saying at </v>
<v Speaker 5>400,</v>

2110
01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:07.330
<v Speaker 5>at 3:50,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at 300.</v>

2111
01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:10.180
<v Speaker 5>The rifles blazed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but still the Germans came on.</v>

2112
01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:15.300
<v Speaker 5>They were getting nearer and nearer and </v>
<v Speaker 5>for the first time I began to feel </v>

2113
01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:18.331
<v Speaker 5>rather anxious and frightened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They weren't an indeterminant mass </v>

2114
01:59:18.331 --> 01:59:19.000
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could actually pick out details,</v>

2115
01:59:19.180 --> 01:59:22.330
<v Speaker 5>see them as individual men coming on and</v>
<v Speaker 5>coming on.</v>

2116
01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:26.680
<v Speaker 5>And the officers still cool as anything </v>
<v Speaker 5>was saying at 2:50,</v>

2117
01:59:27.010 --> 01:59:31.060
<v Speaker 5>at 200,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then he said 10 rounds rapid and the</v>

2118
01:59:31.061 --> 01:59:34.390
<v Speaker 5>chaps opened up and the Germans just </v>
<v Speaker 5>fell down like logs.</v>

2119
01:59:34.540 --> 01:59:36.820
<v Speaker 5>I've never seen anything like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The discipline,</v>

2120
01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:39.850
<v Speaker 5>the fire discipline of these troops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never forgotten that.</v>

2121
01:59:39.851 --> 01:59:42.130
<v Speaker 5>I was so impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As a boy of 16,</v>

2122
01:59:42.131 --> 01:59:44.080
<v Speaker 5>I was simply astounded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought,</v>

2123
01:59:44.290 --> 01:59:48.070
<v Speaker 5>what a marvelous army we are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The attack was completely repulsed,</v>

2124
01:59:48.130 --> 01:59:50.620
<v Speaker 5>probably not for long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was long enough for us to get the</v>

2125
01:59:50.621 --> 01:59:53.650
<v Speaker 5>guns away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It saved us and</v>

2126
01:59:55.590 --> 02:00:00.590
<v Speaker 5>now I probably have more than 20 books </v>
<v Speaker 5>sitting around me here from historians </v>

2127
02:00:00.590 --> 02:00:03.740
<v Speaker 5>talking about this same event.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it is amazing to go from historian,</v>

2128
02:00:03.790 --> 02:00:08.790
<v Speaker 5>historian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>historian and see the different ways </v>

2129
02:00:08.790 --> 02:00:08.790
<v Speaker 5>this is viewed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>interpreted.</v>

2130
02:00:08.790 --> 02:00:11.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm a perfect example is Peter Hearts a </v>
<v Speaker 5>wonderful book.</v>

2131
02:00:11.461 --> 02:00:16.461
<v Speaker 5>He's a historian at Britain's imperial </v>
<v Speaker 5>war museum and he's one of those </v>

2132
02:00:16.461 --> 02:00:18.090
<v Speaker 5>contrarians who says all this is a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 5>of nonsense</v>

2133
02:00:19.740 --> 02:00:24.740
<v Speaker 5>and let's understand quickly that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's normal in war time for this to </v>

2134
02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:29.691
<v Speaker 5>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's not a single power involved in </v>

2135
02:00:29.691 --> 02:00:31.440
<v Speaker 5>the conflict that wants to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Defeats or bad things.</v>

2136
02:00:31.441 --> 02:00:36.441
<v Speaker 5>Everybody wants propaganda victories.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody wants stuff that helps </v>

2137
02:00:36.441 --> 02:00:39.501
<v Speaker 5>recruiting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're looking for stuff that you can </v>

2138
02:00:39.501 --> 02:00:39.501
<v Speaker 5>play up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe a,</v>

2139
02:00:39.501 --> 02:00:42.570
<v Speaker 5>as Peter Harte suggests,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what this miracle at malls is,</v>

2140
02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:47.960
<v Speaker 5>but he shoots down a number of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>typical arguments pointing out that the </v>

2141
02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:50.020
<v Speaker 5>Germans handled themselves very well and</v>
<v Speaker 5>in fact,</v>

2142
02:00:50.021 --> 02:00:55.021
<v Speaker 5>if the casualty numbers or what he </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinks they are probably deserve a </v>

2143
02:00:55.021 --> 02:00:55.290
<v Speaker 5>victory at the battle of Mons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

2144
02:00:55.291 --> 02:01:00.291
<v Speaker 5>the French and the Germans both thought </v>
<v Speaker 5>the British were defeated there at the </v>

2145
02:01:00.291 --> 02:01:00.291
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He writes,</v>

2146
02:01:00.291 --> 02:01:04.161
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when Yvonne Glucose First Army smashed </v>

2147
02:01:04.161 --> 02:01:05.340
<v Speaker 5>into Smith Dorian and second core at </v>
<v Speaker 5>6:00</v>

2148
02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:10.340
<v Speaker 5>AM on the 23rd of August.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The battle that ensued was to enter </v>

2149
02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:12.240
<v Speaker 5>British military folklore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The myth is one of the heroic successful</v>

2150
02:01:12.241 --> 02:01:17.241
<v Speaker 5>defense with well trained British </v>
<v Speaker 5>Tommy's mowing down hordes of Germans </v>

2151
02:01:17.241 --> 02:01:19.680
<v Speaker 5>repeatedly attacking in mass formations.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Finally,</v>

2152
02:01:19.681 --> 02:01:23.280
<v Speaker 5>the British would be forced to retreat </v>
<v Speaker 5>only because the fickle French had given</v>

2153
02:01:23.281 --> 02:01:28.281
<v Speaker 5>way on their right flank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This view of the battle is a great yarn </v>

2154
02:01:28.281 --> 02:01:31.790
<v Speaker 5>he writes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like the angels have moms at its </v>

2155
02:01:31.790 --> 02:01:34.641
<v Speaker 5>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is the product of wishful thinking </v>

2156
02:01:34.641 --> 02:01:34.641
<v Speaker 5>and quote.</v>

2157
02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:38.320
<v Speaker 5>He then goes on to deal with every </v>
<v Speaker 5>single reality.</v>

2158
02:01:38.321 --> 02:01:41.900
<v Speaker 5>We've talked in this battle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shooting down each one of them.</v>

2159
02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:43.790
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as best he can.</v>

2160
02:01:43.791 --> 02:01:48.791
<v Speaker 5>It's controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's a fantastic historian who's </v>

2161
02:01:48.791 --> 02:01:51.881
<v Speaker 5>qualified to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I should like to point out though that </v>

2162
02:01:51.881 --> 02:01:52.550
<v Speaker 5>this was no different,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2163
02:01:52.551 --> 02:01:57.500
<v Speaker 5>manufacturing of victory or playing up a</v>
<v Speaker 5>victory and and magnifying the very real</v>

2164
02:01:57.501 --> 02:02:02.501
<v Speaker 5>heroism on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's not only nothing wrong with </v>

2165
02:02:02.501 --> 02:02:05.771
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty standard behavior for </v>

2166
02:02:05.771 --> 02:02:05.771
<v Speaker 5>every military and every war you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>think of.</v>

2167
02:02:05.771 --> 02:02:06.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

2168
02:02:06.590 --> 02:02:09.590
<v Speaker 5>he'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm quote as to the second core,</v>

2169
02:02:09.591 --> 02:02:13.670
<v Speaker 5>being undefeated and forced to fall back</v>
<v Speaker 5>only to conform with the French on their</v>

2170
02:02:13.671 --> 02:02:15.530
<v Speaker 5>right flank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is pure nonsense.</v>

2171
02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:20.740
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reality is that on many occasions </v>

2172
02:02:20.740 --> 02:02:23.170
<v Speaker 5>the Germans seemed to have been all too </v>
<v Speaker 5>successful in forcing a retreat and to </v>

2173
02:02:23.170 --> 02:02:23.170
<v Speaker 5>quote.</v>

2174
02:02:23.170 --> 02:02:27.550
<v Speaker 5>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably the best army in the world is </v>

2175
02:02:27.550 --> 02:02:29.300
<v Speaker 5>operating that way in the field and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>disconcerting.</v>

2176
02:02:29.301 --> 02:02:30.920
<v Speaker 5>If you're on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>

2177
02:02:30.921 --> 02:02:31.610
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

2178
02:02:31.850 --> 02:02:34.910
<v Speaker 5>it is undeniable that several of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>British battalions fought well,</v>

2179
02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:40.060
<v Speaker 5>but modern scholarship has revealed that</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Germans maneuvered skillfully to </v>

2180
02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:43.851
<v Speaker 5>secure a local superiority against the </v>
<v Speaker 5>weak points in the British defenses </v>

2181
02:02:43.851 --> 02:02:44.930
<v Speaker 5>wherever possible they operated against </v>
<v Speaker 5>the flanks,</v>

2182
02:02:45.110 --> 02:02:50.110
<v Speaker 5>forcing the British to fall back or risk</v>
<v Speaker 5>being cutoff and totally destroyed </v>

2183
02:02:50.110 --> 02:02:52.400
<v Speaker 5>throughout the Germans seemed to have </v>
<v Speaker 5>handled their artillery and machine guns</v>

2184
02:02:52.401 --> 02:02:55.790
<v Speaker 5>with a great tactical dexterity born of </v>
<v Speaker 5>long practice,</v>

2185
02:02:55.940 --> 02:03:00.940
<v Speaker 5>operating them in tandem to dominate the</v>
<v Speaker 5>British and the firefight effectively </v>

2186
02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:02.690
<v Speaker 5>rendering rifle fire of secondary </v>
<v Speaker 5>importance.</v>

2187
02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:06.530
<v Speaker 5>The British were turned out of their </v>
<v Speaker 5>defensive positions in a matter of a few</v>

2188
02:03:06.530 --> 02:03:09.440
<v Speaker 5>hours and even failed to destroy several</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the canal bridges.</v>

2189
02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:11.360
<v Speaker 5>End Quote.</v>

2190
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:15.680
<v Speaker 5>He then goes on to take issue with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>casualties that are often cited.</v>

2191
02:03:15.681 --> 02:03:19.280
<v Speaker 5>One of the things that British uses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>claiming that this is a major victories,</v>

2192
02:03:19.490 --> 02:03:23.870
<v Speaker 5>how many more Germans they killed versus</v>
<v Speaker 5>the casualties they suffered themselves.</v>

2193
02:03:23.871 --> 02:03:28.871
<v Speaker 5>He suggests that even the interpretation</v>
<v Speaker 5>of what those casualties are are </v>

2194
02:03:28.871 --> 02:03:29.480
<v Speaker 5>overblown.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>

2195
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:32.750
<v Speaker 5>this really doesn't matter in the grand </v>
<v Speaker 5>scheme of things.</v>

2196
02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:37.960
<v Speaker 5>Every nation was doing this for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's most interesting is to watch </v>

2197
02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:42.431
<v Speaker 5>these nations and these militaries try </v>
<v Speaker 5>to learn on the fly while they're being </v>

2198
02:03:43.011 --> 02:03:47.870
<v Speaker 5>shot at and translate years of theory </v>
<v Speaker 5>into practice.</v>

2199
02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:54.220
<v Speaker 5>By the 24th of August,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the French will change their mind about </v>

2200
02:03:54.220 --> 02:03:54.700
<v Speaker 5>this whole idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2201
02:03:54.770 --> 02:03:58.400
<v Speaker 5>the offensive at all costs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When did offer is force to say,</v>

2202
02:03:58.490 --> 02:04:00.620
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we need to go on the defensive a while,</v>

2203
02:04:00.621 --> 02:04:01.220
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2204
02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:03.700
<v Speaker 5>like heresy a Amir,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2205
02:04:03.770 --> 02:04:04.460
<v Speaker 5>five,</v>
<v Speaker 5>six,</v>

2206
02:04:04.461 --> 02:04:05.780
<v Speaker 5>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eight days before.</v>

2207
02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:09.230
<v Speaker 5>The reality of the situation on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ground is changing.</v>

2208
02:04:09.231 --> 02:04:10.610
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's mind about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2209
02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:12.710
<v Speaker 5>those tactics we thought before the war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to be good.</v>

2210
02:04:12.830 --> 02:04:13.730
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In practice,</v>

2211
02:04:13.731 --> 02:04:18.731
<v Speaker 5>not so good the British,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether you want to believe that they </v>

2212
02:04:18.731 --> 02:04:22.781
<v Speaker 5>were forced to retire because the French</v>
<v Speaker 5>left them in the lurch or whether you </v>

2213
02:04:22.781 --> 02:04:26.441
<v Speaker 5>want to believe as a heart does that the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Germans were just really quite good at </v>

2214
02:04:26.511 --> 02:04:30.370
<v Speaker 5>turning flanks and employing combined </v>
<v Speaker 5>arms as it's called to,</v>

2215
02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:35.520
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to get the British in an untenable </v>

2216
02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:35.520
<v Speaker 5>position as it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter.</v>

2217
02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:37.470
<v Speaker 5>The British have to retire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just the French.</v>

2218
02:04:37.471 --> 02:04:40.320
<v Speaker 5>They have to get out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The first armies,</v>

2219
02:04:40.321 --> 02:04:42.780
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>leader von Luke writes in his memoirs,</v>

2220
02:04:42.810 --> 02:04:47.810
<v Speaker 5>the British fought excellently,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that if he had been allowed to sweep</v>

2221
02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:53.360
<v Speaker 5>as widely around the flank as he had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wanted to and has as he requested it at </v>

2222
02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:57.441
<v Speaker 5>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the British would have been in no </v>

2223
02:04:57.441 --> 02:04:59.011
<v Speaker 5>position to fight at all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he would have outflanked them and </v>

2224
02:04:59.011 --> 02:04:59.520
<v Speaker 5>smashed them from the rear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember,</v>

2225
02:04:59.521 --> 02:05:01.710
<v Speaker 5>there will be a lot of finger pointing </v>
<v Speaker 5>after the war,</v>

2226
02:05:02.070 --> 02:05:05.190
<v Speaker 5>over whose fault all of this stuff is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of the generals who were still</v>

2227
02:05:05.191 --> 02:05:10.191
<v Speaker 5>alive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll write things to defend their </v>

2228
02:05:10.191 --> 02:05:10.191
<v Speaker 5>reputation.</v>

2229
02:05:10.191 --> 02:05:13.440
<v Speaker 5>The one thing that you could actively </v>
<v Speaker 5>say is going on here though,</v>

2230
02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:18.800
<v Speaker 5>is that neither the British or the </v>
<v Speaker 5>French were able to stop this movement </v>

2231
02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:22.611
<v Speaker 5>through Belgium that's coming down on </v>
<v Speaker 5>them now and they're all retiring at </v>

2232
02:05:22.611 --> 02:05:25.530
<v Speaker 5>speed and this is the part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2233
02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:29.520
<v Speaker 5>early war narrative that's known as the </v>
<v Speaker 5>great retreat.</v>

2234
02:05:31.290 --> 02:05:36.290
<v Speaker 5>The great retreat is a wonderful example</v>
<v Speaker 5>of one of those moments where I try to </v>

2235
02:05:36.661 --> 02:05:38.460
<v Speaker 5>get in the minds of these people and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

2236
02:05:38.461 --> 02:05:43.461
<v Speaker 5>that's a fruitless task.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's no reason to play with </v>

2237
02:05:43.461 --> 02:05:44.760
<v Speaker 5>history and study history if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>want to try to do that,</v>

2238
02:05:44.761 --> 02:05:47.190
<v Speaker 5>but we all have to recognize how </v>
<v Speaker 5>impossible it is,</v>

2239
02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:50.460
<v Speaker 5>but at the same time you try to put </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself in their shoes.</v>

2240
02:05:50.820 --> 02:05:55.820
<v Speaker 5>If you are one of the commanders of any </v>
<v Speaker 5>of these armies and you're over about </v>

2241
02:05:55.820 --> 02:05:56.820
<v Speaker 5>the age of 58,</v>
<v Speaker 5>59,</v>

2242
02:05:57.210 --> 02:06:00.960
<v Speaker 5>this entire affair is beginning to look </v>
<v Speaker 5>horribly familiar to you.</v>

2243
02:06:00.961 --> 02:06:03.750
<v Speaker 5>If you're on the German side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wonderfully familiar to you,</v>

2244
02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:05.550
<v Speaker 5>it looks like 18,</v>
<v Speaker 5>70 18,</v>

2245
02:06:05.590 --> 02:06:08.100
<v Speaker 5>71.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looks like 44 years ago.</v>

2246
02:06:08.340 --> 02:06:09.660
<v Speaker 5>It looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2247
02:06:09.661 --> 02:06:14.661
<v Speaker 5>when the Germans managed to surround to </v>
<v Speaker 5>entire French armies and get them to </v>

2248
02:06:14.661 --> 02:06:18.891
<v Speaker 5>surrender Sir John French,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the British commander is already making </v>

2249
02:06:19.601 --> 02:06:24.601
<v Speaker 5>plans to get his army to the other side </v>
<v Speaker 5>of Paris and then starting to think </v>

2250
02:06:24.601 --> 02:06:27.310
<v Speaker 5>about the challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the logistical challenges of getting the</v>

2251
02:06:27.311 --> 02:06:32.311
<v Speaker 5>army,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the British army out of France </v>

2252
02:06:32.311 --> 02:06:32.311
<v Speaker 5>altogether and back to the safety of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Britain.</v>

2253
02:06:33.060 --> 02:06:37.260
<v Speaker 5>He's worried about a completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>legitimate threat that the British could</v>

2254
02:06:37.261 --> 02:06:41.850
<v Speaker 5>end up like two French armies ended up </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the last war completely surrounded by</v>

2255
02:06:41.851 --> 02:06:46.851
<v Speaker 5>the enemy and forced to surrender.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if 90 percent of Britain's </v>

2256
02:06:46.851 --> 02:06:51.800
<v Speaker 5>military forces are on the continent and</v>
<v Speaker 5>have to give up to the Germans and go </v>

2257
02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:53.910
<v Speaker 5>into captivity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's quite a hostage situation.</v>

2258
02:06:53.911 --> 02:06:57.180
<v Speaker 5>You have pretty easy to get a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

2259
02:06:57.420 --> 02:07:02.420
<v Speaker 5>Our Miss Disagreement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't you think if you're holding 90 </v>

2260
02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:02.420
<v Speaker 5>percent of the British army hostage</v>

2261
02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:06.020
<v Speaker 5>and French.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's confusing,</v>

2262
02:07:06.021 --> 02:07:07.400
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The British commander named French,</v>

2263
02:07:07.401 --> 02:07:09.650
<v Speaker 5>but French is not confident in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>French.</v>

2264
02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:11.990
<v Speaker 5>He hasn't been impressed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2265
02:07:12.020 --> 02:07:17.020
<v Speaker 5>with his dealings with them so far,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's complained a lot to his </v>

2266
02:07:17.020 --> 02:07:18.410
<v Speaker 5>superior who I think we said was the </v>
<v Speaker 5>military leader in this war.</v>

2267
02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:21.790
<v Speaker 5>Lord Horatio's kitchener who happens to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be a field marshal,</v>

2268
02:07:21.890 --> 02:07:24.410
<v Speaker 5>but in fact at this time he's a cabinet </v>
<v Speaker 5>member,</v>

2269
02:07:24.411 --> 02:07:29.411
<v Speaker 5>the secretary for war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but kitchener at times will feel the </v>

2270
02:07:29.411 --> 02:07:33.011
<v Speaker 5>need to discard his bowler hat and his </v>
<v Speaker 5>suit and tie and throw on his field </v>

2271
02:07:33.011 --> 02:07:34.850
<v Speaker 5>marshal's uniform.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jump on a destroyer,</v>

2272
02:07:34.851 --> 02:07:39.851
<v Speaker 5>go across the English Channel and know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>give French a little piece of his mind,</v>

2273
02:07:39.881 --> 02:07:44.680
<v Speaker 5>bolster his confidence a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but French has a legitimate worry.</v>

2274
02:07:45.250 --> 02:07:50.250
<v Speaker 5>This great retreat that's going on is an</v>
<v Speaker 5>extremely precarious moment because and </v>

2275
02:07:50.561 --> 02:07:55.180
<v Speaker 5>organized retirement can easily turn </v>
<v Speaker 5>into a disorganized,</v>

2276
02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:58.930
<v Speaker 5>panicked route and everyone knows that </v>
<v Speaker 5>in fact,</v>

2277
02:07:59.350 --> 02:08:04.350
<v Speaker 5>only a couple of days after the battle </v>
<v Speaker 5>of Mons British forces will be required </v>

2278
02:08:04.350 --> 02:08:07.180
<v Speaker 5>to turn around and beat off German </v>
<v Speaker 5>attacks against them,</v>

2279
02:08:07.181 --> 02:08:12.181
<v Speaker 5>which is wild when you consider that the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Germans are trying to catch people that </v>

2280
02:08:12.181 --> 02:08:14.260
<v Speaker 5>move away from them at the same maximum </v>
<v Speaker 5>speed.</v>

2281
02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:16.990
<v Speaker 5>If you're a military history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not like I am,</v>

2282
02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:22.380
<v Speaker 5>the one thing that's interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 5>follow at this point in the war is </v>

2283
02:08:22.380 --> 02:08:26.221
<v Speaker 5>something that that is very unusual and </v>
<v Speaker 5>military history because if you were </v>

2284
02:08:26.221 --> 02:08:27.460
<v Speaker 5>going to take a class on military </v>
<v Speaker 5>history,</v>

2285
02:08:27.461 --> 02:08:32.461
<v Speaker 5>this is the point in the war where they </v>
<v Speaker 5>would tell you if you're the Germans </v>

2286
02:08:32.461 --> 02:08:34.810
<v Speaker 5>that you need to send out your mobile </v>
<v Speaker 5>units now and destroy the enemy.</v>

2287
02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:40.040
<v Speaker 5>That's why you have cavalry right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You go talk to a Genghis Khan or at any </v>

2288
02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:43.480
<v Speaker 5>medieval or ancient general in history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're going to tell you,</v>

2289
02:08:43.690 --> 02:08:47.050
<v Speaker 5>go Ghanim sends your cavalry after them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>harassed them,</v>

2290
02:08:47.051 --> 02:08:49.570
<v Speaker 5>just organize them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never give them a moment's peace cutoff.</v>

2291
02:08:49.571 --> 02:08:54.571
<v Speaker 5>Stragglers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you look at where people die </v>

2292
02:08:54.571 --> 02:08:55.990
<v Speaker 5>in premodern warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but even modern warfare,</v>

2293
02:08:56.200 --> 02:09:01.200
<v Speaker 5>they die in the pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The job of the battle is to get the </v>

2294
02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.130
<v Speaker 5>other side to turn and run,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and when they turn and run,</v>

2295
02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:04.510
<v Speaker 5>you crushed them.</v>

2296
02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:07.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at the Iraqi highway of death,</v>

2297
02:09:07.061 --> 02:09:12.061
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're so many Iraqis died fleeing </v>

2298
02:09:12.061 --> 02:09:12.061
<v Speaker 5>Kuwait.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What were they doing?</v>

2299
02:09:12.061 --> 02:09:14.380
<v Speaker 5>They were fleeing throughout most of </v>
<v Speaker 5>human history.</v>

2300
02:09:14.620 --> 02:09:19.620
<v Speaker 5>The casualty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean Alexander the great supposedly </v>

2301
02:09:19.620 --> 02:09:21.160
<v Speaker 5>only suffered less than a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 5>casualties in his entire career,</v>

2302
02:09:21.730 --> 02:09:23.430
<v Speaker 5>although I don't know if I believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that's.</v>

2303
02:09:23.530 --> 02:09:28.530
<v Speaker 5>That's what some military historian side</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the reason those numbers are so low </v>

2304
02:09:28.530 --> 02:09:31.741
<v Speaker 5>is because comparatively few people died</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the battles they died while being </v>

2305
02:09:32.051 --> 02:09:37.051
<v Speaker 5>pursued after the battle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and since Alexander never lost a battle </v>

2306
02:09:37.051 --> 02:09:37.210
<v Speaker 5>of his troops,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never had to face that.</v>

2307
02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:43.320
<v Speaker 5>This is the moment when the German </v>
<v Speaker 5>cavalry should be unleashed and finish </v>

2308
02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:47.411
<v Speaker 5>the job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is is we had this tiny </v>

2309
02:09:47.411 --> 02:09:50.371
<v Speaker 5>little window in military history where </v>
<v Speaker 5>the cavalry is so vulnerable that even </v>

2310
02:09:50.371 --> 02:09:54.841
<v Speaker 5>disorganized,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which the French and the British aren't </v>

2311
02:09:54.841 --> 02:09:56.911
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but even retreating forces can turn </v>

2312
02:09:56.911 --> 02:09:59.201
<v Speaker 5>around form of firing line really </v>
<v Speaker 5>quickly and destroy the pursuing </v>

2313
02:09:59.201 --> 02:10:01.570
<v Speaker 5>cavalry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Add a few howitzers in there and it will</v>

2314
02:10:01.571 --> 02:10:05.350
<v Speaker 5>be carnage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now in the next war,</v>

2315
02:10:05.770 --> 02:10:10.770
<v Speaker 5>mechanized forces,</v>
<v Speaker 5>armor and aircraft will recreate the </v>

2316
02:10:11.051 --> 02:10:14.440
<v Speaker 5>ability to do what light cavalry did </v>
<v Speaker 5>before this period.</v>

2317
02:10:14.710 --> 02:10:19.710
<v Speaker 5>But in this weird little interim era,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cavalry can't pursue and destroy </v>

2318
02:10:19.710 --> 02:10:24.571
<v Speaker 5>forces like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the Germans have to do this same job </v>

2319
02:10:24.571 --> 02:10:27.991
<v Speaker 5>with infantry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is the German infantry </v>

2320
02:10:27.991 --> 02:10:29.830
<v Speaker 5>maximum speed is the speed of a marching</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2321
02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:33.740
<v Speaker 5>which is the exact same speed of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people they're trying catch.</v>

2322
02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:39.460
<v Speaker 1>And yet nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even though the Germans had marched </v>

2323
02:10:39.460 --> 02:10:42.521
<v Speaker 1>along way already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get darn near to catching them </v>

2324
02:10:42.521 --> 02:10:42.521
<v Speaker 1>several times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2325
02:10:42.521 --> 02:10:47.081
<v Speaker 1>on the 26th of August,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British have to turn around and try </v>

2326
02:10:47.081 --> 02:10:50.660
<v Speaker 1>to get a little breathing space from </v>
<v Speaker 1>these German pursuers by,</v>

2327
02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:52.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting them again.</v>

2328
02:10:52.311 --> 02:10:57.311
<v Speaker 1>Can we get them to slow down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause them to form up and have to </v>

2329
02:10:57.311 --> 02:10:57.580
<v Speaker 1>reorganize again and get a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2330
02:10:57.680 --> 02:11:01.430
<v Speaker 1>distance between us and them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the 26th of August,</v>

2331
02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:06.460
<v Speaker 1>the British,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including our friend John Lucy from the </v>

2332
02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:08.440
<v Speaker 1>AEF fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another battle with the Germans this </v>

2333
02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:10.790
<v Speaker 1>time in about 11 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British suffer 8,000</v>

2334
02:11:10.791 --> 02:11:12.710
<v Speaker 1>casualties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2335
02:11:12.711 --> 02:11:17.711
<v Speaker 1>8,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties in the war that's about to </v>

2336
02:11:17.711 --> 02:11:17.711
<v Speaker 1>happen isn't going to seem like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

2337
02:11:17.711 --> 02:11:20.570
<v Speaker 1>And my goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French have suffered 260,000</v>

2338
02:11:20.571 --> 02:11:23.870
<v Speaker 1>wounded in the last few days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to the British army,</v>

2339
02:11:23.871 --> 02:11:25.760
<v Speaker 1>which is historically small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said,</v>

2340
02:11:25.761 --> 02:11:27.320
<v Speaker 1>this is a naval powers army.</v>

2341
02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:29.840
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2342
02:11:29.841 --> 02:11:34.841
<v Speaker 1>when Lieutenant General Sir Archibald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Murray who is with the general staff </v>

2343
02:11:34.841 --> 02:11:35.420
<v Speaker 1>behind the lines is informed of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>8,000</v>

2344
02:11:35.421 --> 02:11:38.420
<v Speaker 1>casualties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple hours later he collapses,</v>

2345
02:11:39.890 --> 02:11:44.890
<v Speaker 1>just faints and collapses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what this shows you mean these are </v>

2346
02:11:44.890 --> 02:11:47.740
<v Speaker 1>hard bitten military men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it shows you the stress and the </v>

2347
02:11:47.740 --> 02:11:49.880
<v Speaker 1>tension that these people are under and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you add to that the fog of war.</v>

2348
02:11:49.970 --> 02:11:53.270
<v Speaker 1>No one knows what's going on and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening so quickly.</v>

2349
02:11:53.271 --> 02:11:58.271
<v Speaker 1>There's a huge amount of stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A German general shoots himself on </v>

2350
02:11:58.271 --> 02:12:02.951
<v Speaker 1>August 20th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all these administers the real </v>

2351
02:12:02.951 --> 02:12:05.411
<v Speaker 1>supreme test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It separates the men from the boys as </v>

2352
02:12:05.411 --> 02:12:07.991
<v Speaker 1>the old saying goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the moment of greatest danger.</v>

2353
02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:12.100
<v Speaker 1>Winston Churchill who was a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>official with the Navy,</v>

2354
02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:14.860
<v Speaker 1>writes about this period in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>retirement,</v>

2355
02:12:14.861 --> 02:12:16.030
<v Speaker 1>this great retreat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and says,</v>

2356
02:12:16.031 --> 02:12:16.390
<v Speaker 1>quote.</v>

2357
02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Then came the days of retreat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw that the French armies of the </v>

2358
02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:22.760
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're holding their own,</v>

2359
02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:27.740
<v Speaker 1>but all the center and left was marching</v>
<v Speaker 1>southward toward Paris as fast as </v>

2360
02:12:27.740 --> 02:12:31.911
<v Speaker 1>possible while our own five divisions </v>
<v Speaker 1>were for several days plainly in the </v>

2361
02:12:31.911 --> 02:12:34.980
<v Speaker 1>very jaws of destruction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says that the admiralty,</v>

2362
02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:40.160
<v Speaker 1>we received requests to shift the base </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the whole army from Avera to send </v>

2363
02:12:40.160 --> 02:12:41.730
<v Speaker 1>those ear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with this complicated business,</v>

2364
02:12:41.731 --> 02:12:43.950
<v Speaker 1>we had to cope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The process of retreat,</v>

2365
02:12:43.951 --> 02:12:48.951
<v Speaker 1>continue day after day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A seemingly irresistible compulsion was </v>

2366
02:12:48.951 --> 02:12:51.120
<v Speaker 1>pressing and forcing backwards the brave</v>
<v Speaker 1>armies of France.</v>

2367
02:12:51.450 --> 02:12:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Why should it stop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would they ever be able to turn?</v>

2368
02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:58.470
<v Speaker 1>If France could not save herself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing could save her and quote,</v>

2369
02:12:59.310 --> 02:13:04.310
<v Speaker 1>the Germans are coming toward Paris and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the allied soon to be officially allied </v>

2370
02:13:04.321 --> 02:13:06.240
<v Speaker 1>armies are moving back in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

2371
02:13:06.690 --> 02:13:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the war plan and you know that </v>

2372
02:13:11.690 --> 02:13:14.100
<v Speaker 1>the French military leaders offer has </v>
<v Speaker 1>not forgotten the plan.</v>

2373
02:13:14.101 --> 02:13:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Even if the Germans get within sight of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paris,</v>

2374
02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:20.190
<v Speaker 1>they're going to lose the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If at the same time that happens,</v>

2375
02:13:20.490 --> 02:13:25.490
<v Speaker 1>the Russians from the east are marching </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the streets of the German </v>

2376
02:13:25.490 --> 02:13:29.391
<v Speaker 1>capital in Berlin has to offer and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole allied higher command realizes </v>

2377
02:13:30.570 --> 02:13:31.590
<v Speaker 1>that they're on way.</v>

2378
02:13:32.980 --> 02:13:37.980
<v Speaker 1>The war can still be won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even with allied forces in the west </v>

2379
02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:41.821
<v Speaker 1>retreating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just have to prolong this conflict </v>

2380
02:13:41.821 --> 02:13:45.061
<v Speaker 1>long enough to let the Russian smash the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans in the east and the war will be </v>

2381
02:13:45.061 --> 02:13:48.541
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter how well the Germans in the </v>

2382
02:13:48.541 --> 02:13:50.971
<v Speaker 1>West are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enter Hindenburg and Ludendorff arriving</v>

2383
02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:58.200
<v Speaker 1>even as all this is going on by train in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the east to take command of that one </v>

2384
02:13:58.391 --> 02:14:02.770
<v Speaker 1>lone German army that got to hold off </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russian steamroller as it approaches</v>

2385
02:14:05.110 --> 02:14:10.110
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians biggest victory at this </v>

2386
02:14:10.110 --> 02:14:10.960
<v Speaker 1>point is the fact that there's an army </v>
<v Speaker 1>there to fight it all.</v>

2387
02:14:11.470 --> 02:14:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Remember the entire German prewar plans </v>
<v Speaker 1>assumed a certain speed for everyone's </v>

2388
02:14:17.531 --> 02:14:21.760
<v Speaker 1>mobilization and the Russians are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>slow ones and here they are,</v>

2389
02:14:21.761 --> 02:14:22.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in two weeks,</v>

2390
02:14:23.170 --> 02:14:25.510
<v Speaker 1>and they're already taking towns in east</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prussia.</v>

2391
02:14:25.750 --> 02:14:26.730
<v Speaker 1>East Prussia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2392
02:14:26.731 --> 02:14:29.980
<v Speaker 1>is this area that was conquered a in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>14th,</v>

2393
02:14:29.981 --> 02:14:32.710
<v Speaker 1>15th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the famous Teutonic Knights,</v>

2394
02:14:33.130 --> 02:14:36.730
<v Speaker 1>which included a large proportion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germanic nobility,</v>

2395
02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:40.060
<v Speaker 1>who eventually will settle down in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>

2396
02:14:40.061 --> 02:14:43.620
<v Speaker 1>And so this is where some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>historic German nobility,</v>

2397
02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:45.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has their biggest states and everything.</v>

2398
02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:47.200
<v Speaker 1>The Kaiser himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2399
02:14:47.201 --> 02:14:52.201
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is historic German territory with </v>

2400
02:14:52.201 --> 02:14:54.490
<v Speaker 1>an abnormal number of the aristocracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2401
02:14:54.491 --> 02:14:59.491
<v Speaker 1>It's an important area and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gateway to Berlin and it's not far from </v>

2402
02:14:59.491 --> 02:15:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Berlin and the Russians manage within </v>
<v Speaker 1>like two weeks of the war.</v>

2403
02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget the six weeks that guys like </v>

2404
02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:10.561
<v Speaker 1>Schlieffen accounted on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Within two weeks they've got half a </v>

2405
02:15:10.561 --> 02:15:14.410
<v Speaker 1>million men operating in that area and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got even more down south against</v>

2406
02:15:14.411 --> 02:15:16.030
<v Speaker 1>the ostrow Hungarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2407
02:15:16.180 --> 02:15:19.120
<v Speaker 1>and it's one of those things where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's an author,</v>

2408
02:15:19.121 --> 02:15:24.121
<v Speaker 1>there's a professor named Shawn mcmaken </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's written a whole book called the </v>

2409
02:15:24.121 --> 02:15:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Russian origins of the first world war </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he says,</v>

2410
02:15:25.961 --> 02:15:30.961
<v Speaker 1>the Russians are the ones who should </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear the entire lion share of the guilt </v>

2411
02:15:30.961 --> 02:15:31.330
<v Speaker 1>for starting this war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted it.</v>

2412
02:15:31.331 --> 02:15:36.331
<v Speaker 1>They planned for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that they </v>

2413
02:15:36.331 --> 02:15:38.760
<v Speaker 1>surprised everybody with their quick </v>
<v Speaker 1>mobilization is because they were ready </v>

2414
02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:43.261
<v Speaker 1>for this war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted it and they put up two </v>

2415
02:15:43.261 --> 02:15:46.141
<v Speaker 1>fifths of their army in Poland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is right next to east Prussia </v>

2416
02:15:46.141 --> 02:15:46.870
<v Speaker 1>ahead of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that when the war starts,</v>

2417
02:15:46.871 --> 02:15:49.450
<v Speaker 1>when they have to mobilize people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not coming from all over Russia.</v>

2418
02:15:49.451 --> 02:15:52.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a ton of them right there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>good units to.</v>

2419
02:15:53.380 --> 02:15:55.720
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Russians are a mess,</v>

2420
02:15:56.530 --> 02:16:01.030
<v Speaker 1>an absolute chaotic disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2421
02:16:01.031 --> 02:16:03.520
<v Speaker 1>if you look at Russian history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet history too,</v>

2422
02:16:03.521 --> 02:16:03.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2423
02:16:03.950 --> 02:16:08.950
<v Speaker 1>just consider that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece of Russian history that's so </v>

2424
02:16:08.950 --> 02:16:08.950
<v Speaker 1>traditional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2425
02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:13.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Russians always start these </v>
<v Speaker 1>wars as disasters.</v>

2426
02:16:13.660 --> 02:16:18.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean in the Second World War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can hardly deal with the fins in </v>

2427
02:16:18.881 --> 02:16:23.881
<v Speaker 1>Finland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is crazy when you think about the </v>

2428
02:16:23.881 --> 02:16:24.820
<v Speaker 1>disparity in everything from resources </v>
<v Speaker 1>to size of the numbers of troops,</v>

2429
02:16:24.821 --> 02:16:29.821
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they can hardly deal with the fins </v>

2430
02:16:29.821 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 1>in the very early part of Second World </v>
<v Speaker 1>War.</v>

2431
02:16:30.670 --> 02:16:33.400
<v Speaker 1>But six years after the second world war</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts,</v>

2432
02:16:33.401 --> 02:16:36.250
<v Speaker 1>they're feeling one of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>armies in human history,</v>

2433
02:16:36.850 --> 02:16:40.300
<v Speaker 1>very typical for the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Takes them a long time to get started,</v>

2434
02:16:40.301 --> 02:16:43.090
<v Speaker 1>but they can be extremely formidable </v>
<v Speaker 1>once they get going.</v>

2435
02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Hindenburg and Ludendorff aren't going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to let them get going.</v>

2436
02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:49.720
<v Speaker 1>When Hindenburg and ludendorff arrive in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the east.</v>

2437
02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys are probably a little.</v>

2438
02:16:53.710 --> 02:16:55.990
<v Speaker 1>What would you call jet lagged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Train lagged.</v>

2439
02:16:55.991 --> 02:17:00.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean Hindenburg is 66 or something and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just out of retirement a couple of days.</v>

2440
02:17:02.590 --> 02:17:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Ludendorff has been on the western front</v>
<v Speaker 1>since about the start of the war room </v>

2441
02:17:07.590 --> 02:17:12.320
<v Speaker 1>where he banging on the door of Leah and</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepting the surrender there a couple </v>

2442
02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:17.760
<v Speaker 1>of days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's helping push land resnick's army </v>

2443
02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:21.661
<v Speaker 1>back on the western front and now here </v>
<v Speaker 1>he is in the east trying to get </v>

2444
02:17:21.661 --> 02:17:23.170
<v Speaker 1>acclimated to what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lieutenant colonel,</v>

2445
02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:28.200
<v Speaker 1>which is a pretty low rank for a guy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the history books like Max Hoffman </v>

2446
02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:32.251
<v Speaker 1>did on the scene though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's an expert on the Russian army and </v>

2447
02:17:32.251 --> 02:17:37.141
<v Speaker 1>of course has been there the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So quickly fills ludendorff and </v>

2448
02:17:37.141 --> 02:17:38.080
<v Speaker 1>Hindenburg in on the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this,</v>

2449
02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:42.460
<v Speaker 1>there's about a half million Russians </v>
<v Speaker 1>nearby and about 175,000</v>

2450
02:17:42.461 --> 02:17:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Germans to deal with them.</v>

2451
02:17:43.750 --> 02:17:46.030
<v Speaker 1>The Russians are divided into two </v>
<v Speaker 1>armies,</v>

2452
02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:51.240
<v Speaker 1>the first and the second army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're making their way across a </v>

2453
02:17:51.240 --> 02:17:55.501
<v Speaker 1>really difficult piece of terrain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a series of lakes and forests and </v>

2454
02:17:56.021 --> 02:18:01.021
<v Speaker 1>marshes and rivers that just is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make these two armies have a hard time </v>

2455
02:18:01.961 --> 02:18:03.640
<v Speaker 1>helping each other out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2456
02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:06.970
<v Speaker 1>while they're on opposite sides of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>big terrain feature.</v>

2457
02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:12.660
<v Speaker 1>He also tells him to Bergen Ludendorff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have a pretty good idea about </v>

2458
02:18:12.660 --> 02:18:17.101
<v Speaker 1>what the Russians are trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Russians had been </v>

2459
02:18:17.101 --> 02:18:19.570
<v Speaker 1>broadcasting radio messages and </v>
<v Speaker 1>telegraph messages to each other without</v>

2460
02:18:19.571 --> 02:18:24.571
<v Speaker 1>using any code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also find a Russian officers body </v>

2461
02:18:24.731 --> 02:18:27.400
<v Speaker 1>after they killed him and it has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>plans on it.</v>

2462
02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:32.640
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is so much information that's </v>

2463
02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:34.480
<v Speaker 1>giving the Russian plans to the Germans </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they start to wonder whether or not</v>

2464
02:18:34.481 --> 02:18:37.540
<v Speaker 1>it's just a reus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the Russians are trying to trap us</v>

2465
02:18:37.541 --> 02:18:41.050
<v Speaker 1>and they're just broadcasting all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fool us because it's so obvious.</v>

2466
02:18:41.050 --> 02:18:42.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would make these kind of mistakes?</v>

2467
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the greatest time in Russian </v>

2468
02:18:49.230 --> 02:18:51.870
<v Speaker 1>military history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote down a list of 12 mistakes that </v>

2469
02:18:51.870 --> 02:18:56.011
<v Speaker 1>were made or or areas that the Russians </v>
<v Speaker 1>were having terrible problems and it's </v>

2470
02:18:56.011 --> 02:18:59.080
<v Speaker 1>not only understandable because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian tradition of starting wars,</v>

2471
02:18:59.081 --> 02:19:02.620
<v Speaker 1>a little chaotically and disorganized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because you know,</v>

2472
02:19:02.621 --> 02:19:06.010
<v Speaker 1>even the really best armies are trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out,</v>

2473
02:19:06.250 --> 02:19:08.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to deal with all this new technology</v>

2474
02:19:08.381 --> 02:19:13.381
<v Speaker 1>in 100 years of theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Returning into fact the British and the </v>

2475
02:19:13.381 --> 02:19:14.650
<v Speaker 1>French and the Germans are all dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this on the western front,</v>

2476
02:19:14.860 --> 02:19:19.860
<v Speaker 1>so it's understandable that an army </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's I'm really not up to those </v>

2477
02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:21.760
<v Speaker 1>standards is dealing with it all too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2478
02:19:21.970 --> 02:19:25.780
<v Speaker 1>even though the numbers on paper say </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's half a million Russians here,</v>

2479
02:19:26.050 --> 02:19:30.590
<v Speaker 1>they've been leaving guns and soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 1>all along the way to get here.</v>

2480
02:19:30.730 --> 02:19:35.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are actual strength when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they get to combat is going to be a lot </v>

2481
02:19:35.730 --> 02:19:38.651
<v Speaker 1>less than it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The logistics and supply situation is </v>

2482
02:19:38.661 --> 02:19:41.360
<v Speaker 1>disastrous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The troops in some cases aren't eating.</v>

2483
02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:44.180
<v Speaker 1>They have rags instead of shoes on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet.</v>

2484
02:19:44.181 --> 02:19:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Some don't have rifles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two commanders,</v>

2485
02:19:48.410 --> 02:19:53.410
<v Speaker 1>a guy named Brendan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brendan comp will command the first </v>

2486
02:19:53.410 --> 02:19:55.961
<v Speaker 1>army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the second arm is a guy named </v>

2487
02:19:55.961 --> 02:19:55.961
<v Speaker 1>Samson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll they hate each other,</v>

2488
02:19:55.961 --> 02:20:00.700
<v Speaker 1>which is going to be a problem because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the plans that the Germans had become </v>

2489
02:20:00.700 --> 02:20:05.081
<v Speaker 1>aware of through all these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>methods say that the Russians are going </v>

2490
02:20:05.081 --> 02:20:08.621
<v Speaker 1>to try a pincer movement on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only one German army in the </v>

2491
02:20:08.621 --> 02:20:11.471
<v Speaker 1>region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this first army will come from the </v>

2492
02:20:11.471 --> 02:20:13.991
<v Speaker 1>north.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second army will come from the </v>

2493
02:20:13.991 --> 02:20:15.701
<v Speaker 1>south,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surround this German army and destroy </v>

2494
02:20:15.701 --> 02:20:17.921
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the commander's hate each other </v>

2495
02:20:17.921 --> 02:20:20.680
<v Speaker 1>and the communications is awful and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to pass this terrain feature for 50</v>

2496
02:20:22.341 --> 02:20:24.800
<v Speaker 1>or 60 miles that will keep them from </v>
<v Speaker 1>working together.</v>

2497
02:20:25.130 --> 02:20:26.960
<v Speaker 1>This pincer movement is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>tough.</v>

2498
02:20:28.130 --> 02:20:31.370
<v Speaker 1>The German reconnaissance is so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

2499
02:20:31.371 --> 02:20:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russians aren't even using aircraft.</v>

2500
02:20:32.991 --> 02:20:37.550
<v Speaker 1>The Germans have air airplanes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zeplin is up there watching what's going</v>

2501
02:20:37.551 --> 02:20:42.551
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Germans have an advantage with </v>

2502
02:20:42.551 --> 02:20:45.080
<v Speaker 1>railroads because railroads help armies </v>
<v Speaker 1>move fast obviously,</v>

2503
02:20:45.081 --> 02:20:47.930
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is is that attacking </v>
<v Speaker 1>armies,</v>

2504
02:20:47.931 --> 02:20:52.931
<v Speaker 1>once they leave their railroads almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>never get the ability to use the </v>

2505
02:20:52.931 --> 02:20:54.980
<v Speaker 1>railroads in the territory they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going through.</v>

2506
02:20:55.160 --> 02:20:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the defenders in their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory can.</v>

2507
02:20:58.101 --> 02:21:03.101
<v Speaker 1>This is one of those things that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the defensive more powerful than the </v>

2508
02:21:03.101 --> 02:21:03.101
<v Speaker 1>offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this war.</v>

2509
02:21:03.101 --> 02:21:07.280
<v Speaker 1>The Germans are able to use railroads to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforce points where they need to be.</v>

2510
02:21:07.281 --> 02:21:10.100
<v Speaker 1>The Russians are past their railroads </v>
<v Speaker 1>now they're walking.</v>

2511
02:21:11.840 --> 02:21:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans know this country.</v>

2512
02:21:14.661 --> 02:21:16.790
<v Speaker 1>They know the terrain and they know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>geography.</v>

2513
02:21:16.791 --> 02:21:21.791
<v Speaker 1>This is an area where sometimes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>German army conducts peacetime </v>

2514
02:21:21.791 --> 02:21:25.151
<v Speaker 1>maneuvers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they set a trap for the Russians and </v>

2515
02:21:25.151 --> 02:21:26.120
<v Speaker 1>it's a very napoleonic strategy.</v>

2516
02:21:26.120 --> 02:21:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to attack these armies </v>

2517
02:21:31.120 --> 02:21:34.570
<v Speaker 1>while these armies are separated by this</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrain and unable to help each other </v>

2518
02:21:34.730 --> 02:21:39.730
<v Speaker 1>and smash them individually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to nullify that </v>

2519
02:21:39.730 --> 02:21:42.530
<v Speaker 1>disadvantage and numbers and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians,</v>

2520
02:21:42.970 --> 02:21:47.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make this a lot easier because they </v>

2521
02:21:47.970 --> 02:21:49.481
<v Speaker 1>don't know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They literally are clueless as to what </v>

2522
02:21:49.481 --> 02:21:51.500
<v Speaker 1>they're facing and the high command </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't helping the situation.</v>

2523
02:21:51.501 --> 02:21:53.720
<v Speaker 1>They're telling General Samson off at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second army,</v>

2524
02:21:54.070 --> 02:21:55.850
<v Speaker 1>listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't see any German forces.</v>

2525
02:21:55.851 --> 02:22:00.851
<v Speaker 1>We don't expect an attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Samson was taking his time blind </v>

2526
02:22:00.851 --> 02:22:04.040
<v Speaker 1>to what's going on around him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the Germans are moving very fast</v>

2527
02:22:04.041 --> 02:22:08.000
<v Speaker 1>and seizing areas to the flank and </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking up positions and setting a trap.</v>

2528
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:11.240
<v Speaker 1>This historians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Nyberg and David Jordan,</v>

2529
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:16.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up the narrative about springing </v>

2530
02:22:16.830 --> 02:22:18.110
<v Speaker 1>the trap on the Russian Second Army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They write,</v>

2531
02:22:18.170 --> 02:22:19.420
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous,</v>

2532
02:22:19.421 --> 02:22:24.421
<v Speaker 1>intense hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>followed as the rest of the trap was </v>

2533
02:22:24.421 --> 02:22:26.891
<v Speaker 1>sprung.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the morning hours of the 28th of </v>

2534
02:22:26.891 --> 02:22:26.891
<v Speaker 1>August.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Germans had control</v>

2535
02:22:26.891 --> 02:22:28.680
<v Speaker 5>of almost all the main roads leading to </v>
<v Speaker 5>Samson offs.</v>

2536
02:22:28.681 --> 02:22:33.681
<v Speaker 5>Forces combat began in the north when a </v>
<v Speaker 5>Russian core advancing without support </v>

2537
02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:39.140
<v Speaker 5>ran into a German core.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Germans who were fully aware of the </v>

2538
02:22:39.140 --> 02:22:39.960
<v Speaker 5>Russian presence and we're lying in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait for them,</v>

2539
02:22:40.050 --> 02:22:42.900
<v Speaker 5>smashed the Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and sent them reeling back in,</v>

2540
02:22:42.901 --> 02:22:47.901
<v Speaker 5>panic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>surprised at the unanticipated presence </v>

2541
02:22:47.901 --> 02:22:50.901
<v Speaker 5>of German forces in the area.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Samson off ordered a general withdrawal </v>

2542
02:22:50.901 --> 02:22:54.891
<v Speaker 5>that night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The full severity of the situation came </v>

2543
02:22:54.891 --> 02:22:56.220
<v Speaker 5>slowly to him as he realized that he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>completely cut off.</v>

2544
02:22:56.490 --> 02:23:00.900
<v Speaker 5>His men began to panic throwing down </v>
<v Speaker 5>weapons and running east as fast as they</v>

2545
02:23:00.901 --> 02:23:05.901
<v Speaker 5>could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>only to end up trapped by strong German </v>

2546
02:23:05.901 --> 02:23:06.390
<v Speaker 5>forces already sitting on their lines of</v>
<v Speaker 5>retreat.</v>

2547
02:23:06.840 --> 02:23:11.840
<v Speaker 5>Confusion and panic reigned in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Russian lines without supplies and </v>

2548
02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:14.880
<v Speaker 5>without communications.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Panic spread quickly run in comms.</v>

2549
02:23:14.881 --> 02:23:19.881
<v Speaker 5>Forces were more than 70 miles away and </v>
<v Speaker 5>would obviously not provide any help at </v>

2550
02:23:19.881 --> 02:23:19.881
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>

2551
02:23:19.881 --> 02:23:23.340
<v Speaker 5>On the 29th of August,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Samson off himself gave into the panic.</v>

2552
02:23:23.460 --> 02:23:26.520
<v Speaker 5>He told a staff officer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is our trusted me.</v>

2553
02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:28.950
<v Speaker 5>How can I face him?</v>
<v Speaker 5>After such a disaster,</v>

2554
02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:34.160
<v Speaker 5>he then headed off into the woods where </v>
<v Speaker 5>he committed suicide rather than face </v>

2555
02:23:34.160 --> 02:23:36.000
<v Speaker 5>capture by the Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was one of the lucky ones.</v>

2556
02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:41.240
<v Speaker 5>Samsonov powerful army of 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>men had suffered one of the most </v>

2557
02:23:41.240 --> 02:23:44.430
<v Speaker 5>lopsided defeats in military history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more than 30,000</v>

2558
02:23:44.431 --> 02:23:48.690
<v Speaker 5>Russians were killed and almost 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>injured prisoner of war camps where they</v>

2559
02:23:48.691 --> 02:23:52.860
<v Speaker 5>faced a dismal future of forced labor </v>
<v Speaker 5>and appallingly bad conditions.</v>

2560
02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:58.100
<v Speaker 5>The German's needed 60 trains to move </v>
<v Speaker 5>all of the Russian equipment they </v>

2561
02:23:58.100 --> 02:24:00.270
<v Speaker 5>captured.</v>
<v Speaker 5>German casualties were less than 20,000</v>

2562
02:24:01.080 --> 02:24:06.080
<v Speaker 5>and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Germans had this fantasy of maybe </v>

2563
02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:10.530
<v Speaker 5>emulating the famous battle of Kony </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hannibal's victory of total encirclement</v>

2564
02:24:10.531 --> 02:24:15.531
<v Speaker 5>over the Romans and the ancient world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but instead they got that in the east </v>

2565
02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:18.420
<v Speaker 5>and right after defeating Samsonov </v>
<v Speaker 5>second army.</v>

2566
02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:23.780
<v Speaker 5>Those troops that had been taken maybe </v>
<v Speaker 5>at great cost very soon from the western</v>

2567
02:24:23.881 --> 02:24:26.940
<v Speaker 5>front arrived not in time for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>initial battle,</v>

2568
02:24:26.941 --> 02:24:29.520
<v Speaker 5>just as lieutenant had told Melissa </v>
<v Speaker 5>earlier,</v>

2569
02:24:29.760 --> 02:24:33.850
<v Speaker 5>but in time to take on the first army of</v>
<v Speaker 5>rent income,</v>

2570
02:24:34.020 --> 02:24:39.020
<v Speaker 5>which the Germans then smash with </v>
<v Speaker 5>similar nasty casualty numbers.</v>

2571
02:24:39.271 --> 02:24:44.271
<v Speaker 5>Now Renon comp will do a better job of </v>
<v Speaker 5>pulling his forces back and saving his </v>

2572
02:24:44.271 --> 02:24:46.890
<v Speaker 5>army from total destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He won't get totally surrounded like the</v>

2573
02:24:46.891 --> 02:24:48.960
<v Speaker 5>battle of [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't matter.</v>

2574
02:24:48.961 --> 02:24:53.190
<v Speaker 5>The results are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of a sudden in shocking fashion.</v>

2575
02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:58.640
<v Speaker 5>The Germans have removed the threat of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Russians coming in and taking Berlin</v>

2576
02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:03.390
<v Speaker 5>before the Germans can take Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of a sudden,</v>

2577
02:25:03.391 --> 02:25:08.391
<v Speaker 5>the whole strategy that the French and </v>
<v Speaker 5>British were delaying and operating </v>

2578
02:25:08.391 --> 02:25:10.020
<v Speaker 5>under the assumption of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we can just hold on a little longer,</v>

2579
02:25:10.021 --> 02:25:12.900
<v Speaker 5>the Russians will solve this war problem</v>
<v Speaker 5>for us.</v>

2580
02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:18.110
<v Speaker 5>All of a sudden the French and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>British are going to have to manage to </v>

2581
02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:20.970
<v Speaker 5>be victorious on the western front if </v>
<v Speaker 5>they want to save themselves.</v>

2582
02:25:21.300 --> 02:25:23.040
<v Speaker 5>That helps not coming from the east</v>

2583
02:25:24.190 --> 02:25:27.370
<v Speaker 1>in the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the great retreat continues,</v>

2584
02:25:28.140 --> 02:25:31.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you begin to see what the level of human</v>

2585
02:25:31.781 --> 02:25:33.520
<v Speaker 1>suffering is going to be in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict,</v>

2586
02:25:33.521 --> 02:25:35.890
<v Speaker 1>and I have to keep reminding myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

2587
02:25:35.891 --> 02:25:38.890
<v Speaker 1>You know the old Joseph Stalin line is </v>
<v Speaker 1>so true.</v>

2588
02:25:39.250 --> 02:25:42.550
<v Speaker 1>One death is a tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a million deaths,</v>

2589
02:25:42.730 --> 02:25:47.730
<v Speaker 1>a statistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these numbers that we will </v>

2590
02:25:47.730 --> 02:25:49.210
<v Speaker 1>constantly throw out in this conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are enormous numbers.</v>

2591
02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:53.080
<v Speaker 1>They fail to register after a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You become numb.</v>

2592
02:25:53.700 --> 02:25:58.570
<v Speaker 1>We take what the last several days on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the western front have done to France,</v>

2593
02:25:58.571 --> 02:26:00.070
<v Speaker 1>as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>75,000</v>

2594
02:26:00.071 --> 02:26:02.350
<v Speaker 1>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 250,000</v>

2595
02:26:02.351 --> 02:26:07.351
<v Speaker 1>wounded in a couple of days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would our modern medical </v>

2596
02:26:07.351 --> 02:26:08.560
<v Speaker 1>establishment deal with a crisis like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

2597
02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:14.280
<v Speaker 1>You forget what it's like on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you need these reports that </v>

2598
02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:17.251
<v Speaker 1>come from people who were there in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the most famous books ever written </v>

2599
02:26:17.251 --> 02:26:17.370
<v Speaker 1>about the.</v>

2600
02:26:17.460 --> 02:26:19.870
<v Speaker 1>It's called now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be told,</v>

2601
02:26:20.110 --> 02:26:25.110
<v Speaker 1>or British reporter named Philip Gibbs </v>
<v Speaker 1>went over to the continent right when </v>

2602
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:26.650
<v Speaker 1>this whole conflict breaks out and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>reported from it,</v>

2603
02:26:27.270 --> 02:26:28.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the great retreat.</v>

2604
02:26:28.810 --> 02:26:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Now what he reported that made it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the media is not what he put in the book</v>

2605
02:26:33.101 --> 02:26:34.390
<v Speaker 1>because what he put in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't.</v>

2606
02:26:34.420 --> 02:26:39.420
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't tell during the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the kind of nasty stuff that </v>

2607
02:26:39.420 --> 02:26:44.041
<v Speaker 1>none of the governments would allow to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be published because it was too raw and </v>

2608
02:26:44.041 --> 02:26:44.860
<v Speaker 1>too real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why gibbs named his book.</v>

2609
02:26:44.950 --> 02:26:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Now it can be told [inaudible] after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

2610
02:26:47.291 --> 02:26:52.291
<v Speaker 1>he wrote it and he describes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions during the great retreat and </v>

2611
02:26:52.291 --> 02:26:53.590
<v Speaker 1>the human suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he reminds us,</v>

2612
02:26:54.040 --> 02:26:59.040
<v Speaker 1>you know what it means to have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of death and destruction and </v>

2613
02:26:59.040 --> 02:27:01.540
<v Speaker 1>injuries and what kind of injuries we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

2614
02:27:01.541 --> 02:27:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like having what?</v>

2615
02:27:03.970 --> 02:27:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight football stadiums worth a people </v>

2616
02:27:08.970 --> 02:27:12.781
<v Speaker 1>in a few days injured and we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about hangnails and sprained </v>

2617
02:27:12.881 --> 02:27:17.470
<v Speaker 1>ankles here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gibbs wrote in August 19,</v>

2618
02:27:17.471 --> 02:27:21.160
<v Speaker 1>14 for publication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Later,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Crowds of people with white faces like </v>

2623
02:27:35.461 --> 02:27:38.350
<v Speaker 5>ghosts in the darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stared at their men retreating like this</v>

2624
02:27:38.351 --> 02:27:41.590
<v Speaker 5>through their city and knew that the </v>

02:27:41.830 --> 02:27:45.760
<v Speaker 5>No Som pedeu whispered a woman and gave </v>
<v Speaker 5>a wailing cry.</v>

2626
02:27:46.030 --> 02:27:51.030
<v Speaker 5>People were fighting their way into </v>
<v Speaker 5>railroad trucks at every station for </v>

2627
02:27:51.030 --> 02:27:51.700
<v Speaker 5>hundreds of miles across northern </v>
<v Speaker 5>France.</v>

2628
02:27:51.970 --> 02:27:54.910
<v Speaker 5>Women were beseeching a place for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sake of their babies.</v>

2629
02:27:55.090 --> 02:27:58.330
<v Speaker 5>There was no food for them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>On journeys of 19 hours or more,</v>

2630
02:27:58.540 --> 02:28:02.800
<v Speaker 5>they fainted from heat and hunger and </v>
<v Speaker 5>old woman died and her corpse blocked up</v>

2631
02:28:02.801 --> 02:28:07.801
<v Speaker 5>the lavatory.</v>
<v Speaker 5>At night they slept on the pavement in </v>

2632
02:28:07.801 --> 02:28:10.891
<v Speaker 5>cities invaded by fugitives at fornay in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Belgium and at Dunkirk on the coast of </v>

2633
02:28:10.961 --> 02:28:15.961
<v Speaker 5>France.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were columns of ambulances </v>

2634
02:28:15.961 --> 02:28:18.270
<v Speaker 5>bringing in an endless tide of wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were laid out stretcher stretcher </v>

2635
02:28:18.270 --> 02:28:20.560
<v Speaker 5>in station yards,</v>
<v Speaker 5>500 at a time.</v>

2636
02:28:20.740 --> 02:28:22.490
<v Speaker 5>Some of their faces were masks,</v>

2637
02:28:22.490 --> 02:28:25.670
<v Speaker 1>have clotted blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the bodies were horribly torn.</v>

2638
02:28:25.850 --> 02:28:29.660
<v Speaker 1>They breathed with a hard snuffle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A foul smell came from them.</v>

2639
02:28:29.870 --> 02:28:32.330
<v Speaker 1>That shout tread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were swilling over the station hall</v>

2640
02:28:32.331 --> 02:28:37.331
<v Speaker 1>with disinfecting fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After getting through with one day's </v>

2641
02:28:37.331 --> 02:28:38.000
<v Speaker 1>wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The French doctor in charge had received</v>

2642
02:28:38.001 --> 02:28:42.350
<v Speaker 1>a telegram from the director of medical </v>
<v Speaker 1>services make ready for 40,000</v>

2643
02:28:42.351 --> 02:28:47.351
<v Speaker 1>wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was during the first battle of the </v>

2644
02:28:47.351 --> 02:28:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Marne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is impossible set of French doctor.</v>

2645
02:28:48.050 --> 02:28:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Four hundred thousand people were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>flight for man twerp into which big </v>

2646
02:28:53.050 --> 02:28:56.651
<v Speaker 1>shells were falling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As English correspondence flatten </v>

2647
02:28:56.651 --> 02:28:59.390
<v Speaker 1>themselves against the walls and said </v>
<v Speaker 1>God in heaven to 150,000</v>

2648
02:28:59.391 --> 02:29:02.180
<v Speaker 1>people coming across the shelf in rowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>boats,</v>

2649
02:29:02.181 --> 02:29:05.690
<v Speaker 1>sailing crafts and rafts invaded one </v>
<v Speaker 1>village in Holland.</v>

2650
02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:08.720
<v Speaker 1>They had no food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Children were mad with fright.</v>

2651
02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:11.120
<v Speaker 1>Young mothers had no milk in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>breasts.</v>

2652
02:29:11.240 --> 02:29:16.240
<v Speaker 1>It was cold at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there were only a few canal boats </v>

2653
02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:16.240
<v Speaker 1>and fisherman's cottages.</v>

2654
02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:20.330
<v Speaker 1>And in them were crowds of fugitives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The odor of human filth exuded from them</v>

2655
02:29:20.450 --> 02:29:25.450
<v Speaker 1>as I smell it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it sickens me in remembrance and </v>

2656
02:29:25.450 --> 02:29:29.500
<v Speaker 1>quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a human tragedy of monumental </v>

2657
02:29:29.901 --> 02:29:34.901
<v Speaker 1>proportions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have to keep telling myself it's </v>

2658
02:29:34.901 --> 02:29:35.630
<v Speaker 1>just getting started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The French have lost in a couple of days</v>

2659
02:29:36.170 --> 02:29:41.170
<v Speaker 1>what the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than the United States lost in </v>

2660
02:29:41.170 --> 02:29:43.511
<v Speaker 1>terms of killed and wounded in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tenure involvement they had in the </v>

2661
02:29:43.511 --> 02:29:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam war in a few days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That right there should put the lie to </v>

2662
02:29:47.650 --> 02:29:49.850
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the French are somehow to </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

2663
02:29:49.851 --> 02:29:50.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2664
02:29:50.811 --> 02:29:55.811
<v Speaker 1>one American surrender monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not surrendering their standing </v>

2665
02:29:55.811 --> 02:29:58.160
<v Speaker 1>and dying on French soil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2666
02:29:58.520 --> 02:30:03.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the sake of just buying their </v>

2667
02:30:03.520 --> 02:30:03.980
<v Speaker 1>comrades a little extra time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francis showing not only that the French</v>

2668
02:30:03.981 --> 02:30:08.981
<v Speaker 1>can take a punch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think everyone at this time </v>

2669
02:30:08.981 --> 02:30:10.520
<v Speaker 1>period was fully aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that modern nation states can.</v>

2670
02:30:11.570 --> 02:30:16.570
<v Speaker 1>It's a mixed blessing though in the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that boxers say that a clean early </v>

2671
02:30:17.721 --> 02:30:20.780
<v Speaker 1>quick knockout is more merciful than </v>
<v Speaker 1>along punishing fight.</v>

2672
02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:26.080
<v Speaker 1>There are historians who say maybe it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have been better for European </v>

2673
02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:27.950
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization standards.</v>

2674
02:30:27.960 --> 02:30:29.510
<v Speaker 1>They are golden age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>

2675
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:31.490
<v Speaker 1>If the Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just won this war quickly,</v>

2676
02:30:32.660 --> 02:30:35.540
<v Speaker 1>you would have had sort of a changing of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guard of the great powers,</v>

2677
02:30:35.780 --> 02:30:38.120
<v Speaker 1>the Germans moving into a more prominent</v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

2678
02:30:38.330 --> 02:30:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Remember there are a new country only </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 44,</v>

2679
02:30:40.761 --> 02:30:45.761
<v Speaker 1>45 years in existence and they've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving up the power chart ever since </v>

2680
02:30:46.491 --> 02:30:49.010
<v Speaker 1>with a bullet as they say in radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it works here too.</v>

2681
02:30:49.940 --> 02:30:54.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this just seems like a natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>progression of things and if you could </v>

2682
02:30:54.940 --> 02:30:58.841
<v Speaker 1>save all the casualties that we know are</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in a multiyear long carnage fest,</v>

2683
02:30:59.331 --> 02:31:04.331
<v Speaker 1>which we'll get to later and maybe save </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries from communism and Nazi-ism,</v>

2684
02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:08.000
<v Speaker 1>maybe prevent a second world war and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cold War after that.</v>

2685
02:31:08.240 --> 02:31:13.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean the dominoes that fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you talk about this war maybe ending </v>

2686
02:31:13.240 --> 02:31:14.060
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you can play that game forever,</v>

2687
02:31:14.061 --> 02:31:19.061
<v Speaker 1>can't you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can see knowing how bad it's </v>

2688
02:31:19.061 --> 02:31:19.890
<v Speaker 1>going to get and how bad it already is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why some historians have wondered how</v>

2689
02:31:20.460 --> 02:31:24.780
<v Speaker 5>anything it wouldn't be better than what</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to experience.</v>

2690
02:31:25.770 --> 02:31:27.690
<v Speaker 5>If you are French,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you may say to yourself,</v>

2691
02:31:27.691 --> 02:31:29.790
<v Speaker 5>we would never have wanted to live under</v>
<v Speaker 5>the German boot.</v>

2692
02:31:30.020 --> 02:31:32.040
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>victory was all important.</v>

2693
02:31:32.840 --> 02:31:37.840
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what if you could have all those </v>

2694
02:31:37.840 --> 02:31:37.840
<v Speaker 5>freshmen who die in the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>story back?</v>

2695
02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:39.780
<v Speaker 5>What if you can avoid the second world </v>
<v Speaker 5>war?</v>

2696
02:31:39.781 --> 02:31:41.310
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when does it become worth it?</v>

2697
02:31:41.850 --> 02:31:43.380
<v Speaker 5>Same thing to the Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2698
02:31:43.800 --> 02:31:46.140
<v Speaker 5>you look back and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what if we could have those people,</v>

2699
02:31:46.141 --> 02:31:49.190
<v Speaker 5>but what if we could have that wealth </v>
<v Speaker 5>back now?</v>

2700
02:31:49.250 --> 02:31:54.250
<v Speaker 5>What if we could have that time where we</v>
<v Speaker 5>were in 1900 back?</v>

2701
02:31:57.610 --> 02:32:00.490
<v Speaker 5>That's called crying over historical </v>
<v Speaker 5>spilled milk,</v>

2702
02:32:00.491 --> 02:32:05.491
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't prevent historians from </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing that all the time and it has even </v>

2703
02:32:05.491 --> 02:32:09.421
<v Speaker 5>less of a inhibition on people like </v>
<v Speaker 5>yours truly who aren't historians at </v>

2704
02:32:09.421 --> 02:32:09.460
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>

2705
02:32:11.010 --> 02:32:16.010
<v Speaker 5>The question of what decision should </v>
<v Speaker 5>have happened is obviously a </v>

2706
02:32:16.010 --> 02:32:19.491
<v Speaker 5>historically moot point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The question of what's going to happen </v>

2707
02:32:19.491 --> 02:32:23.150
<v Speaker 5>is about to be determined now and one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the things that sort of makes this </v>

2708
02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:27.561
<v Speaker 5>battle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what it is that shaping up if battles </v>

2709
02:32:27.561 --> 02:32:30.111
<v Speaker 5>even the right word for it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that everybody kind of knows it's </v>

2710
02:32:30.111 --> 02:32:31.920
<v Speaker 5>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's either coming or the war's over.</v>

2711
02:32:32.130 --> 02:32:37.130
<v Speaker 5>Basically the Germans are moving forward</v>
<v Speaker 5>across almost the entire line and the </v>

2712
02:32:37.171 --> 02:32:42.171
<v Speaker 5>French and British or moving backwards </v>
<v Speaker 5>across almost the entire line and at </v>

2713
02:32:42.171 --> 02:32:44.250
<v Speaker 5>some point they've got to turn around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've got to make a stand.</v>

2714
02:32:44.550 --> 02:32:49.550
<v Speaker 5>They've got a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Germans in the nose or there's </v>

2715
02:32:49.550 --> 02:32:49.550
<v Speaker 5>nothing that's going to stop them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the problem is,</v>

2716
02:32:49.550 --> 02:32:51.510
<v Speaker 5>is that everybody's at the end of their </v>
<v Speaker 5>rope.</v>

2717
02:32:52.260 --> 02:32:54.720
<v Speaker 5>Everybody has been marching and fighting</v>
<v Speaker 5>for days.</v>

2718
02:32:54.721 --> 02:32:56.850
<v Speaker 5>These units that weren't missing a </v>
<v Speaker 5>buckle,</v>

2719
02:32:57.270 --> 02:32:59.940
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in parades across Belgium as the Germans</v>

2720
02:32:59.941 --> 02:33:04.941
<v Speaker 5>started this war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or missing a heck of a lot more than </v>

2721
02:33:04.941 --> 02:33:04.941
<v Speaker 5>that as are the other allied armies.</v>

2722
02:33:05.190 --> 02:33:10.190
<v Speaker 5>This is why it's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you can actually get fresh troops </v>

2723
02:33:10.190 --> 02:33:11.490
<v Speaker 5>into the combat who don't look the way </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2724
02:33:11.491 --> 02:33:16.491
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these soldiers that had been in contact </v>

2725
02:33:16.491 --> 02:33:18.831
<v Speaker 5>now for almost two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at one point during his </v>

2726
02:33:18.831 --> 02:33:21.861
<v Speaker 5>inspections,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jennifer's riding around and he runs </v>

2727
02:33:21.861 --> 02:33:24.741
<v Speaker 5>into some French soldiers and Barbara </v>
<v Speaker 5>Tuchman describes the experience quote </v>

2728
02:33:24.741 --> 02:33:28.940
<v Speaker 5>on this same day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>August 30th is you offer a visited the </v>

2729
02:33:28.940 --> 02:33:32.181
<v Speaker 5>front of the third and fourth armies to </v>
<v Speaker 5>look for forces he could assign to </v>

2730
02:33:32.181 --> 02:33:35.841
<v Speaker 5>Foshe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Another French general talk man </v>

2731
02:33:35.841 --> 02:33:37.050
<v Speaker 5>continues on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He passed the retreating columns who had</v>

2732
02:33:37.051 --> 02:33:39.510
<v Speaker 5>fought in the den and on the heights of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the muse,</v>

2733
02:33:39.780 --> 02:33:42.240
<v Speaker 5>red trousers had faded to the color of </v>
<v Speaker 5>Pale.</v>

2734
02:33:42.241 --> 02:33:46.620
<v Speaker 5>Brick coats were ragged and torn shoes </v>
<v Speaker 5>caked with mud.</v>

2735
02:33:46.830 --> 02:33:51.830
<v Speaker 5>I's cavernous in faces dulled by </v>
<v Speaker 5>exhaustion and dark with many days </v>

2736
02:33:51.830 --> 02:33:54.750
<v Speaker 5>growth of beard,</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 days campaigning seemed to have age,</v>

2737
02:33:54.751 --> 02:33:59.751
<v Speaker 5>the soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as many years they walked heavily as if </v>

2738
02:33:59.751 --> 02:33:59.751
<v Speaker 5>ready to drop it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every step,</v>

2739
02:33:59.751 --> 02:34:02.670
<v Speaker 5>emaciated horses with bones sticking out</v>
<v Speaker 5>and with bleeding.</v>

2740
02:34:02.671 --> 02:34:07.140
<v Speaker 5>Harness sores sometimes dropped in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>shafts were hurriedly unharnessed by the</v>

2741
02:34:07.141 --> 02:34:12.141
<v Speaker 5>artillery men and dragged off to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>side of the road so as not to obstruct </v>

2742
02:34:12.141 --> 02:34:15.891
<v Speaker 5>the way guns looked old and blistered </v>
<v Speaker 5>with barely a few patches of their once </v>

2743
02:34:15.891 --> 02:34:17.890
<v Speaker 5>new gray paint showing through the mud </v>
<v Speaker 5>and dirt</v>

2744
02:34:18.970 --> 02:34:22.410
<v Speaker 1>and quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our Irish friend from the BDF,</v>

2745
02:34:22.420 --> 02:34:25.480
<v Speaker 1>John Lucy entitles a whole chapter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his book,</v>

2746
02:34:25.780 --> 02:34:29.200
<v Speaker 1>sleep marching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he talks about how there were people</v>

2747
02:34:29.201 --> 02:34:34.201
<v Speaker 1>that would just stop at the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road and not care if the Germans were </v>

2748
02:34:34.201 --> 02:34:35.020
<v Speaker 1>going to capture them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't move for anything.</v>

2749
02:34:35.021 --> 02:34:40.021
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was exhausted and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had talked about how the Russian </v>

2750
02:34:40.060 --> 02:34:45.060
<v Speaker 1>supply and logistics and all that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>falling apart because they weren't one </v>

2751
02:34:45.060 --> 02:34:48.601
<v Speaker 1>of the best armies out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to cope with the new modern </v>

2752
02:34:48.601 --> 02:34:48.601
<v Speaker 1>realities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2753
02:34:48.601 --> 02:34:52.051
<v Speaker 1>the Germans probably are the best army </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to cope with the new modern </v>

2754
02:34:52.051 --> 02:34:53.020
<v Speaker 1>realities and their logistics aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping up either.</v>

2755
02:34:53.330 --> 02:34:58.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a perfect example is the number of </v>

2756
02:34:58.330 --> 02:35:00.031
<v Speaker 1>shells that they're using in the number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of bullets they're using is so far </v>

2757
02:35:00.031 --> 02:35:01.840
<v Speaker 1>greater than anything anyone had </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicted that they're running out.</v>

2758
02:35:02.230 --> 02:35:03.070
<v Speaker 1>They're rationing.</v>

2759
02:35:03.370 --> 02:35:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Some of these generals are are limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a few shells a day for their gun.</v>

2760
02:35:07.031 --> 02:35:11.710
<v Speaker 1>It makes it very difficult to fight the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battles that you know on paper.</v>

2761
02:35:11.980 --> 02:35:16.980
<v Speaker 1>The German prewar planned had sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>depended on this is where the </v>

2762
02:35:17.201 --> 02:35:19.840
<v Speaker 1>operational plans designed before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

2763
02:35:19.841 --> 02:35:24.841
<v Speaker 1>whether you want to call them the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Schlieffen plan or their sleep and </v>

2764
02:35:24.841 --> 02:35:27.130
<v Speaker 1>multichip plant or just whatever it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the German generals thought they were </v>

2765
02:35:27.130 --> 02:35:28.810
<v Speaker 1>going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't ever take into account enough.</v>

2766
02:35:29.170 --> 02:35:34.170
<v Speaker 1>The human element and the variables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wonderfully planned and you know,</v>

2767
02:35:34.630 --> 02:35:39.630
<v Speaker 1>t's crossed and I's dotted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are things you just can't </v>

2768
02:35:39.630 --> 02:35:42.841
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't know how tired people are </v>

2769
02:35:42.841 --> 02:35:45.631
<v Speaker 1>going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how quickly you can't know how many </v>

2770
02:35:45.631 --> 02:35:48.151
<v Speaker 1>times they can fight battles before they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't fight anymore and you can't </v>

2771
02:35:48.151 --> 02:35:51.661
<v Speaker 1>predict when they're going to be things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like hold ups in food and supplies.</v>

2772
02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:55.780
<v Speaker 1>The schlieffen plan or whatever you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to call it,</v>

2773
02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:58.690
<v Speaker 1>is falling apart due to the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>variables.</v>

2774
02:35:58.810 --> 02:36:03.810
<v Speaker 1>The number one human variable is clues </v>
<v Speaker 1>and von Bulow first and second army </v>

2775
02:36:03.911 --> 02:36:08.911
<v Speaker 1>troops cannot March 15 or 20 miles a day</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single day while fighting battles </v>

2776
02:36:11.020 --> 02:36:13.600
<v Speaker 1>and getting far ahead of their supplies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not eating.</v>

2777
02:36:13.601 --> 02:36:18.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're worn down by the time they </v>

2778
02:36:18.601 --> 02:36:18.601
<v Speaker 1>reached this stage in the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These vaunted,</v>

2779
02:36:18.730 --> 02:36:23.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tips of the spear are worn down to a </v>

2780
02:36:23.730 --> 02:36:23.730
<v Speaker 1>dullness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2781
02:36:23.730 --> 02:36:25.960
<v Speaker 1>they're almost down to 50 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength.</v>

2782
02:36:26.290 --> 02:36:31.290
<v Speaker 1>What's more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember they've had units pulled from </v>

2783
02:36:31.290 --> 02:36:31.290
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2784
02:36:31.290 --> 02:36:34.441
<v Speaker 1>for over the last several weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Multiple took some and put them down </v>

2785
02:36:34.441 --> 02:36:34.441
<v Speaker 1>south and gave him to Prince Rupert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2786
02:36:34.441 --> 02:36:36.760
<v Speaker 1>he sent a couple to the east to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the Russians.</v>

2787
02:36:37.030 --> 02:36:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Just when you kind of want some nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh troops to throw into this thing,</v>

2788
02:36:40.451 --> 02:36:45.451
<v Speaker 1>they aren't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The troops you do have though are very </v>

2789
02:36:45.791 --> 02:36:49.870
<v Speaker 1>excited about the prospect of ending </v>
<v Speaker 1>this war and capturing Paris.</v>

2790
02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:56.160
<v Speaker 1>A member of staff talks about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting nearby Paris has reenergized </v>

2791
02:36:58.421 --> 02:37:03.421
<v Speaker 1>exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men are soldiers are worn out for four </v>

2792
02:37:03.421 --> 02:37:07.981
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd been marching 40 kilometers a </v>

2793
02:37:07.981 --> 02:37:07.981
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ground is difficult.</v>

2794
02:37:07.981 --> 02:37:11.630
<v Speaker 1>The roads are torn up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trees felled the fields pitted by shells</v>

2795
02:37:11.631 --> 02:37:14.800
<v Speaker 1>like strainers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The soldiers stagger at every step.</v>

2796
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Their faces are plastered</v>

2797
02:37:16.430 --> 02:37:18.830
<v Speaker 5>with dust.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their uniforms are in rags.</v>

2798
02:37:19.010 --> 02:37:24.010
<v Speaker 5>One might call them living rag bags.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They marched with closed eyes and sing </v>

2799
02:37:24.010 --> 02:37:26.270
<v Speaker 5>in chorus to keep from falling asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As they march.</v>

2800
02:37:26.540 --> 02:37:31.540
<v Speaker 5>The certainty of victory close at hand </v>
<v Speaker 5>and have their triumphal entry into </v>

2801
02:37:31.540 --> 02:37:33.440
<v Speaker 5>Paris sustains them and whips up their </v>
<v Speaker 5>enthusiasm.</v>

2802
02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:36.680
<v Speaker 5>Without this certainty of victory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would fall exhausted.</v>

2803
02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:40.280
<v Speaker 5>They would lie down where they are to </v>
<v Speaker 5>sleep it last no matter where,</v>

2804
02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:44.810
<v Speaker 5>no matter how and to give their bodies a</v>
<v Speaker 5>drunkenness like that of their souls.</v>

2805
02:37:44.990 --> 02:37:49.990
<v Speaker 5>They drink enormously,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this drunk and this also helps to </v>

2806
02:37:49.990 --> 02:37:49.990
<v Speaker 5>keep them up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Today,</v>

2807
02:37:49.990 --> 02:37:52.190
<v Speaker 5>after an inspection,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the general was furiously angry.</v>

2808
02:37:52.310 --> 02:37:54.680
<v Speaker 5>He wanted to put an end to this </v>
<v Speaker 5>collective to botch.</v>

2809
02:37:54.860 --> 02:37:57.290
<v Speaker 5>We've just persuaded him not to give </v>
<v Speaker 5>severe orders.</v>

2810
02:37:57.500 --> 02:38:02.500
<v Speaker 5>It is better not to be too strict </v>
<v Speaker 5>otherwise the army could not go on at </v>

2811
02:38:02.500 --> 02:38:03.080
<v Speaker 5>all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For this abnormal weariness,</v>

2812
02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:08.200
<v Speaker 5>abnormal stimulants are needed in Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We shall remedy all this end quote </v>

2813
02:38:10.580 --> 02:38:15.580
<v Speaker 5>indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When they saw signs saying that Paris </v>

2814
02:38:15.580 --> 02:38:17.450
<v Speaker 5>was 20 slash 22 slash 23 miles in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>distance,</v>

2815
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:22.750
<v Speaker 5>it was as though they've been given a b,</v>
<v Speaker 5>12 shot one German officer on September,</v>

2816
02:38:24.321 --> 02:38:25.220
<v Speaker 5>third road,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

2817
02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:29.640
<v Speaker 5>one of our battalions was marching.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're really forward all at once.</v>

2818
02:38:29.730 --> 02:38:34.730
<v Speaker 5>While passing a crossroad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they discovered a sign post on which </v>

2819
02:38:34.730 --> 02:38:38.520
<v Speaker 5>they read Paris 37 kilometers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was the first sign posts that had not</v>

2820
02:38:38.521 --> 02:38:42.330
<v Speaker 5>been erased on seeing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The battalion was as though shaken up by</v>

2821
02:38:42.331 --> 02:38:45.090
<v Speaker 5>an electric current.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The word Paris,</v>

2822
02:38:45.120 --> 02:38:47.460
<v Speaker 5>which they have just read,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drives them crazy.</v>

2823
02:38:47.580 --> 02:38:49.800
<v Speaker 5>Some of them embrace the wretched </v>
<v Speaker 5>signpost.</v>

2824
02:38:49.950 --> 02:38:52.080
<v Speaker 5>Others dance around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it cries,</v>

2825
02:38:52.140 --> 02:38:55.230
<v Speaker 5>yells of enthusiasm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>accompany these mad actions,</v>

2826
02:38:55.470 --> 02:38:58.290
<v Speaker 5>this sign post.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is there evidence that we are near Paris</v>

2827
02:38:58.470 --> 02:39:00.840
<v Speaker 5>that without a doubt we shall soon </v>
<v Speaker 5>really be there.</v>

2828
02:39:01.050 --> 02:39:03.000
<v Speaker 5>This notice board has had a miraculous </v>
<v Speaker 5>effect.</v>

2829
02:39:03.210 --> 02:39:06.270
<v Speaker 5>Faces light up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Weariness seems to disappear.</v>

2830
02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:11.480
<v Speaker 5>The march has resumed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alert cadenced in spite of the </v>

2831
02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:13.770
<v Speaker 5>abominable ground in the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Songs burst forth louder.</v>

2832
02:39:14.580 --> 02:39:19.580
<v Speaker 5>End Quote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One can only imagine the disappointment </v>

2833
02:39:19.580 --> 02:39:23.700
<v Speaker 5>those soldiers must've felt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and probably a little bit of </v>

2834
02:39:23.700 --> 02:39:26.221
<v Speaker 5>bewilderment went on August 30.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First they changed course and instead of</v>

2835
02:39:26.261 --> 02:39:29.860
<v Speaker 5>heading toward Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they make us sort of a left hand turn,</v>

2836
02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:34.400
<v Speaker 5>so then they're going to march by Paris </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're gonna see it on there,</v>

2837
02:39:34.401 --> 02:39:39.401
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And supposedly according to the </v>

2838
02:39:39.401 --> 02:39:41.891
<v Speaker 5>accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of Von cluck soldiers were able to </v>

2839
02:39:41.891 --> 02:39:41.990
<v Speaker 5>see the Eiffel Tower in the distance.</v>

2840
02:39:42.820 --> 02:39:47.820
<v Speaker 5>Imagine the confusion and disappointment</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there must've been some </v>

2841
02:39:47.921 --> 02:39:49.420
<v Speaker 5>bewilderment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what are we doing?</v>

2842
02:39:49.421 --> 02:39:53.320
<v Speaker 5>There's Paris where we're right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Believe me,</v>

2843
02:39:53.321 --> 02:39:56.890
<v Speaker 5>the government in Paris realizes it on </v>
<v Speaker 5>September second,</v>

2844
02:39:56.920 --> 02:39:58.390
<v Speaker 5>they flee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had to Bordeaux,</v>

2845
02:39:58.391 --> 02:40:02.470
<v Speaker 5>which is as far away as you can get from</v>
<v Speaker 5>where the Germans are without,</v>

2846
02:40:03.180 --> 02:40:04.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not being in France anymore.</v>

2847
02:40:04.681 --> 02:40:07.110
<v Speaker 5>It's on the Atlantic coast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>basically the Bay of Biscay,</v>

2848
02:40:07.350 --> 02:40:11.400
<v Speaker 5>so they leave a lot of refugees leave </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the soldiers who think,</v>

2849
02:40:11.401 --> 02:40:16.401
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the city is basically wide open for us </v>

2850
02:40:16.401 --> 02:40:16.401
<v Speaker 5>and we're heading</v>

2851
02:40:16.401 --> 02:40:16.401
<v Speaker 1>in a different direction.</v>

2852
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:20.930
<v Speaker 1>This turn by these soldiers in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different direction.</v>

2853
02:40:20.990 --> 02:40:25.990
<v Speaker 1>We'll create a million questions and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>million opportunities and it will make </v>

2854
02:40:27.171 --> 02:40:31.520
<v Speaker 1>this story almost impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand if you're even able to follow</v>

2855
02:40:31.521 --> 02:40:36.521
<v Speaker 1>it to this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The battle that is shaping up here is </v>

2856
02:40:36.521 --> 02:40:37.850
<v Speaker 1>the most complicated I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>encountered.</v>

2857
02:40:39.110 --> 02:40:44.110
<v Speaker 1>It takes forever to really try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand this and then once you think </v>

2858
02:40:44.110 --> 02:40:48.551
<v Speaker 1>you got it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't figure out how to explain it </v>

2859
02:40:48.551 --> 02:40:50.441
<v Speaker 1>to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even really meet the </v>

2860
02:40:50.441 --> 02:40:53.200
<v Speaker 1>definition of battle at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's understand why it's possible.</v>

2861
02:40:53.570 --> 02:40:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been comparing this little </v>

2862
02:40:58.570 --> 02:41:00.161
<v Speaker 1>conflict here to a heavyweight fight and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they often have three knocked </v>

2863
02:41:00.731 --> 02:41:01.880
<v Speaker 1>down rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you know,</v>

2864
02:41:01.881 --> 02:41:04.310
<v Speaker 1>if you're knocked down three times in </v>
<v Speaker 1>any one round,</v>

2865
02:41:04.340 --> 02:41:09.340
<v Speaker 1>the fights over the French at this point</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been knocked down twice in the </v>

2866
02:41:09.340 --> 02:41:13.031
<v Speaker 1>first round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing seemingly to keep it </v>

2867
02:41:13.031 --> 02:41:16.481
<v Speaker 1>from happening again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except that giant of a man who comes </v>

2868
02:41:17.241 --> 02:41:18.590
<v Speaker 1>into his own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2869
02:41:19.090 --> 02:41:20.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first world war,</v>

2870
02:41:20.461 --> 02:41:23.060
<v Speaker 1>his version of the second world wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill,</v>

2871
02:41:23.690 --> 02:41:26.090
<v Speaker 1>but for France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joseph,</v>

2872
02:41:26.330 --> 02:41:29.180
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where he makes his name.</v>

2873
02:41:29.181 --> 02:41:32.780
<v Speaker 1>This is his moment in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is his destiny right here.</v>

2874
02:41:32.781 --> 02:41:34.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Churchill had said,</v>

2875
02:41:34.190 --> 02:41:37.370
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I had lived my whole life </v>
<v Speaker 1>just for this moment.</v>

2876
02:41:38.020 --> 02:41:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Gioffre is exactly what France needs now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they missed in 1940.</v>

2877
02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:47.560
<v Speaker 1>This is when he takes charge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>performs miracles and his one of his </v>

2878
02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:51.101
<v Speaker 1>generals later said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what we would've done </v>

2879
02:41:51.101 --> 02:41:51.101
<v Speaker 1>without him.</v>

2880
02:41:51.101 --> 02:41:55.400
<v Speaker 1>As we said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's possible there are only in this </v>

2881
02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:57.351
<v Speaker 1>situation because of poor decisions by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy earlier during the blind chess </v>

2882
02:41:57.351 --> 02:41:58.290
<v Speaker 1>playing side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of this thing,</v>

2883
02:41:58.950 --> 02:42:03.950
<v Speaker 1>but now when everyone's panicking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the French government is moving as far </v>

2884
02:42:03.950 --> 02:42:05.610
<v Speaker 1>away as they can and the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>commander on the scene's pretty sure the</v>

2885
02:42:05.611 --> 02:42:09.540
<v Speaker 1>war's already over and is worried about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how he gets his army out of here and the</v>

2886
02:42:09.541 --> 02:42:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Kaiser's slapping everybody on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>backend,</v>

2887
02:42:11.940 --> 02:42:13.800
<v Speaker 1>as Churchill says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in a horrible mood.</v>

2888
02:42:13.960 --> 02:42:18.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean everything looks really good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans at this point and the French</v>

2889
02:42:18.060 --> 02:42:23.060
<v Speaker 1>could easily lose heart here except </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer is taking charge and starts by </v>

2890
02:42:24.661 --> 02:42:29.661
<v Speaker 1>firing generals that aren't within about</v>
<v Speaker 1>a week or 10 days.</v>

2891
02:42:30.830 --> 02:42:35.750
<v Speaker 1>He fires a 140 of them to have five army</v>
<v Speaker 1>commanders,</v>

2892
02:42:36.050 --> 02:42:41.050
<v Speaker 1>nine corps commanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>38 of 82 divisional generals and he's </v>

2893
02:42:42.201 --> 02:42:45.830
<v Speaker 1>replacing them with much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much better people.</v>

2894
02:42:45.831 --> 02:42:46.970
<v Speaker 1>He even said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2895
02:42:46.971 --> 02:42:51.971
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these guys were great </v>
<v Speaker 1>professors and they taught at the </v>

2896
02:42:51.971 --> 02:42:51.971
<v Speaker 1>academy while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>

2897
02:42:51.971 --> 02:42:55.691
<v Speaker 1>good peace time generals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's replacing them with people who've </v>

2898
02:42:55.691 --> 02:42:57.590
<v Speaker 1>already demonstrated in this short </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time that they can get the job</v>

2899
02:42:57.591 --> 02:42:59.030
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fighting generals,</v>

2900
02:42:59.031 --> 02:43:00.620
<v Speaker 1>they're names are famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're false.</v>

2901
02:43:00.830 --> 02:43:02.370
<v Speaker 1>They're pitocin there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>golly,</v>

2902
02:43:02.371 --> 02:43:02.810
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

2903
02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:09.960
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to help him turn the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tide here as soon as they get some </v>

2904
02:43:10.391 --> 02:43:13.690
<v Speaker 1>troops to with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you offer does next.</v>

2905
02:43:13.960 --> 02:43:18.960
<v Speaker 1>He gets involved in figuring out ways to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get troops to the crucial points in the </v>

2906
02:43:18.960 --> 02:43:23.701
<v Speaker 1>battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He changes his strategy right after the </v>

2907
02:43:23.701 --> 02:43:23.701
<v Speaker 1>battle of the frontiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2908
02:43:23.701 --> 02:43:26.590
<v Speaker 1>to have all this offensive operations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has people sit down,</v>

2909
02:43:27.530 --> 02:43:32.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold off the Germans on the defensive </v>

2910
02:43:32.530 --> 02:43:35.071
<v Speaker 1>while he figures out a way to get enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth to the important place to make </v>

2911
02:43:35.071 --> 02:43:37.870
<v Speaker 1>things happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And during all of this,</v>

2912
02:43:38.380 --> 02:43:43.380
<v Speaker 1>the guy is absolutely freakishly calm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what France needs at </v>

2913
02:43:46.231 --> 02:43:51.231
<v Speaker 1>this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember we said the art of generalship </v>

2914
02:43:51.231 --> 02:43:53.510
<v Speaker 1>is kind of bringing what qualities you </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring to the table to bear at the right </v>

2915
02:43:53.510 --> 02:43:58.101
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course there's a little luck </v>

2916
02:43:58.101 --> 02:43:58.110
<v Speaker 1>involved in that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is your first time</v>

2917
02:44:00.390 --> 02:44:04.800
<v Speaker 1>and while all the panic was going on as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gj Meyer says,</v>

2918
02:44:05.460 --> 02:44:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer was imperturbable quote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the midst of it all for remained </v>

2919
02:44:11.221 --> 02:44:12.960
<v Speaker 1>impassive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maddeningly,</v>

2920
02:44:12.961 --> 02:44:14.460
<v Speaker 1>silent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calm.</v>

2921
02:44:14.700 --> 02:44:18.390
<v Speaker 1>No matter how alarming the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how terrible the emergency,</v>

2922
02:44:18.540 --> 02:44:22.230
<v Speaker 1>the tall and road ton to generalists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mo never seemed disturbed.</v>

2923
02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:26.130
<v Speaker 1>He became famous for the care he always </v>
<v Speaker 1>took to have a good lunch,</v>

2924
02:44:26.280 --> 02:44:31.280
<v Speaker 1>followed by a nap in the day with a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner and always get a full night's </v>

2925
02:44:31.280 --> 02:44:35.541
<v Speaker 1>sleep in bed at nine back to work at </v>
<v Speaker 1>five even when things seem to be at </v>

2926
02:44:35.541 --> 02:44:40.221
<v Speaker 1>their worst Meyer rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made his staff understand that under </v>

2927
02:44:40.221 --> 02:44:42.210
<v Speaker 1>no circumstances was his rest to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbed,</v>

2928
02:44:42.630 --> 02:44:47.630
<v Speaker 1>but between meal times in bedtimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was steadily on the move using a big </v>

2929
02:44:47.630 --> 02:44:52.011
<v Speaker 1>touring car driven by a grand prix </v>
<v Speaker 1>racing champion to make repeated visits </v>

2930
02:44:52.011 --> 02:44:54.090
<v Speaker 1>to his generals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially those on the left,</v>

2931
02:44:54.330 --> 02:44:55.260
<v Speaker 1>meaning the left flank.</v>

2932
02:44:55.950 --> 02:45:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Thus he was able to keep himself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch with events and observe his </v>

2933
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:02.820
<v Speaker 1>subordinance inaction and quote and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire.</v>

2934
02:45:02.821 --> 02:45:07.821
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what this is doing is steadily </v>

2935
02:45:07.821 --> 02:45:09.780
<v Speaker 1>creating better leadership in key </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions,</v>

2936
02:45:09.900 --> 02:45:12.810
<v Speaker 1>learning from mistakes and taking real </v>
<v Speaker 1>time knowledge,</v>

2937
02:45:12.811 --> 02:45:16.920
<v Speaker 1>not theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and applying it and taking men who could</v>

2938
02:45:16.921 --> 02:45:21.921
<v Speaker 1>inspire troops in hopeless situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

2939
02:45:22.230 --> 02:45:26.670
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer doesn't command all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>generals in this war on his side.</v>

2940
02:45:27.180 --> 02:45:32.180
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting a coalition battle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a British army that makes up a </v>

2941
02:45:32.180 --> 02:45:36.081
<v Speaker 1>part of his battle line that is hesitant</v>
<v Speaker 1>about involving itself in anything </v>

2942
02:45:37.471 --> 02:45:41.980
<v Speaker 1>involving combat at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sir John French,</v>

2943
02:45:41.981 --> 02:45:45.160
<v Speaker 1>the ironically named leader of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British Expeditionary Force,</v>

2944
02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:50.520
<v Speaker 1>doesn't trust the French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks he's already had his flank </v>

2945
02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:51.460
<v Speaker 1>exposed once and didn't put in great </v>
<v Speaker 1>danger.</v>

2946
02:45:51.670 --> 02:45:55.360
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't see any evidence that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French can be trusted to win this war.</v>

2947
02:45:56.830 --> 02:46:01.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Germans have basically thrown</v>
<v Speaker 1>a the Schlieffen plan if there ever was </v>

2948
02:46:01.830 --> 02:46:06.370
<v Speaker 1>one out the window here and attacked </v>
<v Speaker 1>along the entire Franco German border,</v>

2949
02:46:06.371 --> 02:46:11.371
<v Speaker 1>which is that area that is so well </v>
<v Speaker 1>protected by forts that the Germans </v>

2950
02:46:11.371 --> 02:46:15.710
<v Speaker 1>thought it worth violating Belgium's </v>
<v Speaker 1>neutrality and bringing the British into</v>

2951
02:46:15.711 --> 02:46:19.850
<v Speaker 1>the war just so they could avoid that </v>
<v Speaker 1>area and those forts.</v>

2952
02:46:20.210 --> 02:46:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Well now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three weeks into the war,</v>

2953
02:46:22.250 --> 02:46:25.100
<v Speaker 1>they're attacking along that entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>front and if they break through,</v>

2954
02:46:25.400 --> 02:46:28.160
<v Speaker 1>they will completely surround the French</v>
<v Speaker 1>and destroy their armies.</v>

2955
02:46:29.090 --> 02:46:32.180
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that those forts were </v>
<v Speaker 1>originally avoided for a reason.</v>

2956
02:46:32.390 --> 02:46:36.410
<v Speaker 1>They're formidable and all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>the French troops in that area are doing</v>

2957
02:46:36.411 --> 02:46:39.800
<v Speaker 1>a pretty decent job on the defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're still losing lots of people,</v>

2958
02:46:39.801 --> 02:46:44.801
<v Speaker 1>but all of a sudden they get a chance to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out that this war that we're going </v>

2959
02:46:44.801 --> 02:46:48.821
<v Speaker 1>to call the first world war is the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the defense has the temporary </v>

2960
02:46:48.821 --> 02:46:50.900
<v Speaker 1>dominance over the offense and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>French.</v>

2961
02:46:51.350 --> 02:46:53.270
<v Speaker 1>In the last battle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only days ago,</v>

2962
02:46:53.271 --> 02:46:58.271
<v Speaker 1>we're doing band net charges and </v>
<v Speaker 1>advancing in close order and all those </v>

2963
02:46:58.271 --> 02:46:59.750
<v Speaker 1>things you're not supposed to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing up during the shrapnel attacks.</v>

2964
02:47:00.140 --> 02:47:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Now they get a chance to be the ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the machine guns and behind the </v>

2965
02:47:05.140 --> 02:47:07.400
<v Speaker 1>field guns firing behind them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into Germans,</v>

2966
02:47:07.401 --> 02:47:12.401
<v Speaker 1>advancing in the open while the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>gunners dig themselves a little holes </v>

2967
02:47:12.401 --> 02:47:16.241
<v Speaker 1>that are almost deep enough to be called</v>
<v Speaker 1>trenches already and see what the power </v>

2968
02:47:16.241 --> 02:47:18.290
<v Speaker 1>of defense means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2969
02:47:18.440 --> 02:47:18.920
<v Speaker 1>for them,</v>

2970
02:47:20.550 --> 02:47:22.680
<v Speaker 1>the good news is they don't get over run</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Germans.</v>

2971
02:47:22.681 --> 02:47:25.320
<v Speaker 1>The bad news is it looks like they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>spare a few troops,</v>

2972
02:47:25.590 --> 02:47:29.130
<v Speaker 1>which is what Jennifer is doing now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where the real miracle comes in.</v>

2973
02:47:29.370 --> 02:47:31.560
<v Speaker 1>The guy can scrounge troops from </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

2974
02:47:32.770 --> 02:47:37.770
<v Speaker 1>He pulls them off of the line in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these battles near the French fortress </v>

2975
02:47:37.770 --> 02:47:38.560
<v Speaker 1>line where the French needed every man </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've gotten.</v>

2976
02:47:38.561 --> 02:47:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Jennifer's taken people anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He needs them elsewhere more.</v>

2977
02:47:42.310 --> 02:47:47.310
<v Speaker 1>He's taking newly returned wounded back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got know colonial troops coming on </v>

2978
02:47:47.411 --> 02:47:52.411
<v Speaker 1>boats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's taking people from the far west of </v>

2979
02:47:52.411 --> 02:47:54.091
<v Speaker 1>France and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's using the rail system to get them </v>

2980
02:47:54.091 --> 02:47:54.940
<v Speaker 1>to an important concentration points </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>

2981
02:47:55.750 --> 02:48:00.750
<v Speaker 1>He creates a new army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He calls the sixth and he puts it over </v>

2982
02:48:00.750 --> 02:48:04.291
<v Speaker 1>by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flank of the British expeditionary </v>

2983
02:48:04.291 --> 02:48:04.291
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He creates another one called the night.</v>

2984
02:48:04.291 --> 02:48:05.620
<v Speaker 1>He puts it over as a reserve kind of by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paris.</v>

2985
02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:08.020
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want to have an army in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paris,</v>

2986
02:48:08.021 --> 02:48:13.021
<v Speaker 1>which is a great fortress actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the government of France makes him </v>

2987
02:48:13.021 --> 02:48:16.651
<v Speaker 1>have one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they put Jennifer's old commander </v>

2988
02:48:16.651 --> 02:48:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Galliani.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in charge of it and put him in Paris</v>

2989
02:48:19.451 --> 02:48:21.870
<v Speaker 1>and basically everyone thinks he's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to stay there and you know,</v>

2990
02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:23.650
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the walls with his men.</v>

2991
02:48:23.650 --> 02:48:27.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the plan anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Theoretically and day after day,</v>

2992
02:48:27.041 --> 02:48:30.420
<v Speaker 1>more French trains are arriving and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>troops are,</v>

2993
02:48:30.880 --> 02:48:33.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>de training and moving over to the front</v>

2994
02:48:33.311 --> 02:48:34.870
<v Speaker 1>over by Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facing,</v>

2995
02:48:35.290 --> 02:48:37.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the projected direction that this sledge</v>

2996
02:48:37.940 --> 02:48:42.940
<v Speaker 1>is gonna fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And remember they're losing troops </v>

2997
02:48:42.940 --> 02:48:43.040
<v Speaker 1>everyday they're down to half their </v>
<v Speaker 1>original strengthened.</v>

2998
02:48:43.060 --> 02:48:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Here's Shawfer everyday bringing in more</v>
<v Speaker 1>French troops to face it.</v>

2999
02:48:46.991 --> 02:48:50.140
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden the numerical advantage </v>
<v Speaker 1>begins to diminish.</v>

3000
02:48:51.100 --> 02:48:55.150
<v Speaker 1>And then on August 31st aircraft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

3001
02:48:55.810 --> 02:49:00.810
<v Speaker 1>aircraft again starting to make an </v>
<v Speaker 1>impact already in this early 20th </v>

3002
02:49:00.810 --> 02:49:03.871
<v Speaker 1>century war aircraft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notice that the Germans have changed </v>

3003
02:49:03.871 --> 02:49:07.531
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing we told you that those </v>

3004
02:49:07.531 --> 02:49:08.010
<v Speaker 1>troops have been bewildered</v>

3005
02:49:08.010 --> 02:49:10.710
<v Speaker 5>by all of a sudden they're not heading </v>
<v Speaker 5>toward Paris anymore.</v>

3006
02:49:10.711 --> 02:49:13.170
<v Speaker 5>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And more importantly,</v>

3007
02:49:13.410 --> 02:49:18.410
<v Speaker 5>when they changed direction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they present their flanks to the newly </v>

3008
02:49:19.981 --> 02:49:23.160
<v Speaker 5>created forces,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially the one in Paris.</v>

3009
02:49:24.690 --> 02:49:27.270
<v Speaker 5>There's a chance for a counter attack </v>
<v Speaker 5>here,</v>

3010
02:49:27.450 --> 02:49:32.450
<v Speaker 5>a chance to turn around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the entire great retreat and </v>

3011
02:49:32.450 --> 02:49:36.951
<v Speaker 5>attack Joffrin needs to convince Sir </v>
<v Speaker 5>John French of the BDF that now's the </v>

3012
02:49:37.621 --> 02:49:39.450
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the opportunities there,</v>

3013
02:49:39.510 --> 02:49:44.510
<v Speaker 5>we need you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he gives one of these great </v>

3014
02:49:44.510 --> 02:49:47.481
<v Speaker 5>speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the way he recorded himself and </v>

3015
02:49:47.481 --> 02:49:50.571
<v Speaker 5>remember Sir John French doesn't speak </v>
<v Speaker 5>French and Gioffre doesn't speak </v>

3016
02:49:50.571 --> 02:49:54.030
<v Speaker 5>English,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the translator is another British,</v>

3017
02:49:54.031 --> 02:49:58.350
<v Speaker 5>generally guy named Wilson who's much </v>
<v Speaker 5>more diplomatic and likes the French,</v>

3018
02:49:58.351 --> 02:50:03.351
<v Speaker 5>much more than Sir John French does,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so there's some fun moments there </v>

3019
02:50:03.351 --> 02:50:08.061
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's what Jennifer's own account of </v>

3020
02:50:08.061 --> 02:50:10.941
<v Speaker 5>his encounter with French to try to </v>
<v Speaker 5>convince them that now is the time to </v>

3021
02:50:10.941 --> 02:50:10.941
<v Speaker 5>strike.</v>

3022
02:50:10.941 --> 02:50:11.220
<v Speaker 5>This was our opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the last chance.</v>

3023
02:50:11.221 --> 02:50:16.221
<v Speaker 5>All the cards are on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Shows that there was another side to </v>

3024
02:50:16.221 --> 02:50:20.691
<v Speaker 5>this man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He wasn't just the impenetrable obelisk </v>

3025
02:50:20.691 --> 02:50:22.650
<v Speaker 5>where you couldn't figure out what that </v>
<v Speaker 5>placid look on his face meant.</v>

3026
02:50:22.710 --> 02:50:25.680
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes he could be positively </v>
<v Speaker 5>Churchillian,</v>

3027
02:50:25.830 --> 02:50:28.380
<v Speaker 5>and this was one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He told French,</v>

3028
02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:32.300
<v Speaker 5>a suspicious and pessimistic French </v>
<v Speaker 5>quote.</v>

3029
02:50:33.480 --> 02:50:37.020
<v Speaker 5>I put my whole soul into the effort to </v>
<v Speaker 5>convince the Field Marshal,</v>

3030
02:50:37.230 --> 02:50:42.230
<v Speaker 5>I told him that the decisive moment had </v>
<v Speaker 5>arrived and that we must not let it </v>

3031
02:50:42.230 --> 02:50:43.560
<v Speaker 5>escape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We must go to battle with every man both</v>

3032
02:50:43.561 --> 02:50:46.080
<v Speaker 5>of us had and free from all </v>
<v Speaker 5>reservations.</v>

3033
02:50:46.380 --> 02:50:49.410
<v Speaker 5>So far as the French army is concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I continued.</v>

3034
02:50:49.590 --> 02:50:51.960
<v Speaker 5>My orders are given and whatever may </v>
<v Speaker 5>happen,</v>

3035
02:50:52.080 --> 02:50:57.080
<v Speaker 5>I intend to throw my last company into </v>
<v Speaker 5>the balance to win victory and save </v>

3036
02:50:57.080 --> 02:50:58.830
<v Speaker 5>France.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is in her name that I come to ask you</v>

3037
02:50:58.831 --> 02:51:02.700
<v Speaker 5>for British assistance and I urge it </v>
<v Speaker 5>with all my power I have in me.</v>

3038
02:51:02.910 --> 02:51:06.120
<v Speaker 5>I cannot not believe that the British </v>
<v Speaker 5>army will refuse to do it.</v>

3039
02:51:06.121 --> 02:51:10.530
<v Speaker 5>Share in the supreme crisis history </v>
<v Speaker 5>would severely judge your absence.</v>

3040
02:51:10.860 --> 02:51:15.860
<v Speaker 5>Then as I finished,</v>
<v Speaker 5>carried away by my convictions and the </v>

3041
02:51:15.860 --> 02:51:18.951
<v Speaker 5>gravity of the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember bringing down my fist on a </v>

3042
02:51:18.951 --> 02:51:19.980
<v Speaker 5>table which stood at my elbow and </v>
<v Speaker 5>crying.</v>

3043
02:51:20.130 --> 02:51:23.460
<v Speaker 5>Ms Dot Marshall,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the honor of England is at stake.</v>

3044
02:51:23.760 --> 02:51:26.880
<v Speaker 5>Up to this point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>French had listened imperturbably to the</v>

3045
02:51:26.881 --> 02:51:28.950
<v Speaker 5>officer who was translating what I'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

3046
02:51:29.250 --> 02:51:32.640
<v Speaker 5>but now his face suddenly reddened there</v>
<v Speaker 5>ensued a long,</v>

3047
02:51:32.641 --> 02:51:35.400
<v Speaker 5>impressive silence and then with visible</v>
<v Speaker 5>emotion,</v>

3048
02:51:35.401 --> 02:51:40.401
<v Speaker 5>he murmured.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will do all that I possibly can not </v>

3049
02:51:40.401 --> 02:51:41.130
<v Speaker 5>understanding English.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I asked Wilson,</v>

3050
02:51:41.131 --> 02:51:42.300
<v Speaker 5>what's her?</v>
<v Speaker 5>John had said,</v>

3051
02:51:42.480 --> 02:51:45.540
<v Speaker 5>he merely replied,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the field marshal says yes.</v>

3052
02:51:46.050 --> 02:51:51.050
<v Speaker 5>I had distinctly felt the emotion which </v>
<v Speaker 5>seemed to grip the British commander in </v>

3053
02:51:51.050 --> 02:51:53.190
<v Speaker 5>chief above all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had remarked the tone of his voice and</v>

3054
02:51:53.191 --> 02:51:58.191
<v Speaker 5>I felt as did all the witnesses to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>scene that these simple words were </v>

3055
02:51:58.191 --> 02:52:01.620
<v Speaker 5>equivalent to an agreement signed and </v>
<v Speaker 5>sworn to tea,</v>

3056
02:52:01.680 --> 02:52:04.170
<v Speaker 5>which was already prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 5>was then served.</v>

3057
02:52:06.460 --> 02:52:07.690
<v Speaker 5>Barbara Tuchman,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course,</v>

3058
02:52:07.700 --> 02:52:12.700
<v Speaker 5>related a little bit more dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She says that a tear welled up in Sir </v>

3059
02:52:13.181 --> 02:52:16.720
<v Speaker 5>John French's I and it rolled down his </v>
<v Speaker 5>cheek before.</v>

3060
02:52:16.721 --> 02:52:18.040
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how to tell him.</v>

3061
02:52:18.041 --> 02:52:23.041
<v Speaker 5>Just tell him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll do everything we can to one of </v>

3062
02:52:23.041 --> 02:52:25.951
<v Speaker 5>those critical dramatic moments in </v>
<v Speaker 5>history when you want that you want the </v>

3063
02:52:25.951 --> 02:52:29.380
<v Speaker 5>guy who would have been the real best </v>
<v Speaker 5>first house of hardcore history,</v>

3064
02:52:29.381 --> 02:52:33.340
<v Speaker 5>I think if it weren't hg wells,</v>
<v Speaker 5>would have to be Churchill winded and in</v>

3065
02:52:33.341 --> 02:52:36.250
<v Speaker 5>his account of the first world war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which you know,</v>

3066
02:52:36.251 --> 02:52:38.380
<v Speaker 5>is full of Churchillian bias,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all,</v>

3067
02:52:38.381 --> 02:52:40.030
<v Speaker 5>all the things that you normally get </v>
<v Speaker 5>with him,</v>

3068
02:52:40.031 --> 02:52:45.031
<v Speaker 5>but what's fun about it is no one </v>
<v Speaker 5>explains it like he does even with the </v>

3069
02:52:45.031 --> 02:52:49.171
<v Speaker 5>biases and he was there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Churchill's histories are always a </v>

3070
02:52:49.171 --> 02:52:51.100
<v Speaker 5>combination of romance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3071
02:52:51.220 --> 02:52:55.570
<v Speaker 5>history,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if he's in them in a personal memoir</v>

3072
02:52:55.571 --> 02:53:00.571
<v Speaker 5>too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love the way he sort of explains how </v>

3073
02:53:00.571 --> 02:53:01.420
<v Speaker 5>many things had to line up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3074
02:53:01.600 --> 02:53:03.130
<v Speaker 5>All along,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3075
02:53:03.131 --> 02:53:08.131
<v Speaker 5>the war for this opportunity to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>presented to the general in Paris who </v>

3076
02:53:08.891 --> 02:53:13.891
<v Speaker 5>sees fun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cook's First Army turned their flank to </v>

3077
02:53:13.891 --> 02:53:13.891
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>

3078
02:53:14.980 --> 02:53:16.820
<v Speaker 5>Here's how Churchill puts it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

3079
02:53:17.410 --> 02:53:22.410
<v Speaker 5>assuredly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no human brain had conceived the design </v>

3080
02:53:22.410 --> 02:53:23.710
<v Speaker 5>nor had human hand set the pieces on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>board.</v>

3081
02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:28.360
<v Speaker 5>Several separate and discrepant series </v>
<v Speaker 5>of events had flowed together first.</v>

3082
02:53:28.540 --> 02:53:32.350
<v Speaker 5>The man Galliani is on the spot fixed in</v>
<v Speaker 5>his fortress.</v>

3083
02:53:32.410 --> 02:53:37.410
<v Speaker 5>He could not move toward the battle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the mighty battle has been made to </v>

3084
02:53:37.410 --> 02:53:37.450
<v Speaker 5>come to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Second,</v>

3085
02:53:37.720 --> 02:53:40.960
<v Speaker 5>the weapon has been placed in his hands,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the army of mental re.</v>

3086
02:53:41.140 --> 02:53:44.290
<v Speaker 5>It was given him for one purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the defensive Paris.</v>

3087
02:53:44.500 --> 02:53:47.590
<v Speaker 5>He will use it for another,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a decisive maneuver in the field.</v>

3088
02:53:47.830 --> 02:53:49.840
<v Speaker 5>It was given him against the wishes of </v>
<v Speaker 5>buffer.</v>

3089
02:53:49.990 --> 02:53:52.570
<v Speaker 5>It will prove the means of gioffre </v>
<v Speaker 5>salvation.</v>

3090
02:53:52.810 --> 02:53:55.270
<v Speaker 5>Third,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Opportunity Cook,</v>

3091
02:53:55.330 --> 02:54:00.330
<v Speaker 5>swinging forward in hot pursuit of as he</v>
<v Speaker 5>believed the routed British and </v>

3092
02:54:00.330 --> 02:54:04.411
<v Speaker 5>demoralized French will present his </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole right flank and rear as he passes </v>

3093
02:54:04.411 --> 02:54:06.580
<v Speaker 5>Paris to Galliani and men are in his </v>
<v Speaker 5>hand.</v>

3094
02:54:07.060 --> 02:54:12.060
<v Speaker 5>Observe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not one of those factors would have </v>

3095
02:54:12.060 --> 02:54:12.250
<v Speaker 5>counted without the other two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All are interdependent.</v>

3096
02:54:12.340 --> 02:54:14.620
<v Speaker 5>All are here and all are here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

3097
02:54:14.770 --> 02:54:17.290
<v Speaker 5>Galliani realize the position in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>flash.</v>

3098
02:54:17.470 --> 02:54:19.720
<v Speaker 5>I dare not believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He exclaimed.</v>

3099
02:54:19.810 --> 02:54:22.390
<v Speaker 5>It is too good to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it is true.</v>

3100
02:54:22.480 --> 02:54:25.900
<v Speaker 5>Churchill writes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>confirmation arrives hour by hour.</v>

3101
02:54:26.020 --> 02:54:29.710
<v Speaker 5>He vibrates within through Z.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Asm and quote,</v>

3102
02:54:31.010 --> 02:54:33.620
<v Speaker 5>this is what sets up the famous battle </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the Marne.</v>

3103
02:54:35.270 --> 02:54:37.670
<v Speaker 5>The most complicated battle you'll ever </v>
<v Speaker 5>find,</v>

3104
02:54:39.620 --> 02:54:42.410
<v Speaker 5>the battle of the Marne is so hard to </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand for a couple of reasons.</v>

3105
02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:47.680
<v Speaker 5>The first one is just like the battle of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the frontiers that just recently </v>

3106
02:54:47.680 --> 02:54:47.810
<v Speaker 5>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These World War One,</v>

3107
02:54:47.811 --> 02:54:52.811
<v Speaker 5>battles are modern in scale and scope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They are so much larger and so much </v>

3108
02:54:53.481 --> 02:54:56.480
<v Speaker 5>longer than battles in the past were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean a hundred years ago,</v>

3109
02:54:56.481 --> 02:55:01.481
<v Speaker 5>Napoleon is being defeated at Waterloo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a giant battle involving three global </v>

3110
02:55:01.671 --> 02:55:06.671
<v Speaker 5>powers and you could from one end to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>battlefield to the other in no time.</v>

3111
02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:12.160
<v Speaker 5>You could see one side from the other </v>
<v Speaker 5>with those little telescopes.</v>

3112
02:55:12.520 --> 02:55:17.520
<v Speaker 5>They would just put two there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I the battle started in the morning and </v>

3113
02:55:17.520 --> 02:55:21.260
<v Speaker 5>was over at the end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's 100 years ago now.</v>

3114
02:55:21.261 --> 02:55:25.280
<v Speaker 5>The battles last for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well this one will last for officially a</v>

3115
02:55:25.281 --> 02:55:27.110
<v Speaker 5>week,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but really last longer than that,</v>

3116
02:55:27.650 --> 02:55:31.550
<v Speaker 5>the battlefield is at least 100 miles </v>
<v Speaker 5>long depending on who you believe or the</v>

3117
02:55:31.551 --> 02:55:32.630
<v Speaker 5>entire front.</v>

3118
02:55:33.080 --> 02:55:34.910
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>according to other historians,</v>

3119
02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:40.000
<v Speaker 5>you could legitimately have fought at </v>
<v Speaker 5>the battle of the Marne and not know it.</v>

3120
02:55:41.150 --> 02:55:42.890
<v Speaker 5>Turn to a buddy that fought there with </v>
<v Speaker 5>you and say,</v>

3121
02:55:42.891 --> 02:55:47.891
<v Speaker 5>now where are we at?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Marne was fighting officially part </v>

3122
02:55:47.891 --> 02:55:51.221
<v Speaker 5>of that or not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because really it's a catchall term for </v>

3123
02:55:51.221 --> 02:55:55.660
<v Speaker 5>all the fighting that is going on when </v>
<v Speaker 5>what really the Marne is all about </v>

3124
02:55:55.660 --> 02:55:59.030
<v Speaker 5>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is that the great retreat ends and</v>

3125
02:55:59.031 --> 02:56:03.830
<v Speaker 5>the French and British armies turnaround</v>
<v Speaker 5>and launch into contact.</v>

3126
02:56:03.831 --> 02:56:06.410
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not to be fair,</v>

3127
02:56:06.540 --> 02:56:10.850
<v Speaker 5>there are parts of the front that have </v>
<v Speaker 5>never not been in contact in the south.</v>

3128
02:56:11.060 --> 02:56:13.880
<v Speaker 5>They've been fighting pretty much since </v>
<v Speaker 5>minute one and it's never stopped.</v>

3129
02:56:13.881 --> 02:56:16.070
<v Speaker 5>That's why he told them that they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the battle of the Marne.</v>

3130
02:56:16.730 --> 02:56:19.640
<v Speaker 5>They might not even understand it </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they've never not been fighting.</v>

3131
02:56:21.470 --> 02:56:26.470
<v Speaker 5>Historians like Eric Bros suggests that </v>
<v Speaker 5>the battle of the Marne is everything </v>

3132
02:56:26.470 --> 02:56:28.100
<v Speaker 5>that was fought in this one area.</v>

3133
02:56:28.730 --> 02:56:33.320
<v Speaker 5>You know from the center of France up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He describes it this way,</v>

3134
02:56:33.321 --> 02:56:38.321
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what has come to be known as the battle </v>

3135
02:56:38.321 --> 02:56:40.661
<v Speaker 5>of the Marne should really be thought of</v>
<v Speaker 5>as the battle of France for all </v>

3136
02:56:40.661 --> 02:56:44.141
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>50 six allied and 43 and a half German </v>

3137
02:56:44.141 --> 02:56:47.120
<v Speaker 5>divisions engaged one another in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>titanic struggle along the line,</v>

3138
02:56:47.121 --> 02:56:52.121
<v Speaker 5>stretching from Paris to the eastern </v>
<v Speaker 5>frontier and quote in a sense what </v>

3139
02:56:53.601 --> 02:56:58.601
<v Speaker 5>really happened is the opportunity that </v>
<v Speaker 5>was presented by an open flank as we </v>

3140
02:56:59.571 --> 02:57:02.090
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fun first army turns,</v>

3141
02:57:02.570 --> 02:57:07.570
<v Speaker 5>shows his flank to Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Paris now has an army that can hit him </v>

3142
02:57:07.570 --> 02:57:09.020
<v Speaker 5>in the flank and here we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a battle,</v>

3143
02:57:09.260 --> 02:57:14.260
<v Speaker 5>but that just becomes the opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 5>that everybody was waiting for before </v>

3144
02:57:14.260 --> 02:57:15.560
<v Speaker 5>they turn these armies around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

3145
02:57:15.650 --> 02:57:18.980
<v Speaker 5>this had to happen at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is Francis last throw.</v>

3146
02:57:19.910 --> 02:57:21.830
<v Speaker 5>Everybody knows that this has to occur.</v>

3147
02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:25.880
<v Speaker 5>The problem is is that the commanders </v>
<v Speaker 5>who are actually with the troops,</v>

3148
02:57:25.881 --> 02:57:30.881
<v Speaker 5>not these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the general headquarters and the </v>

3149
02:57:30.881 --> 02:57:33.251
<v Speaker 5>highest staff officers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ones who are marching with the </v>

3150
02:57:33.251 --> 02:57:35.951
<v Speaker 5>actual soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are appalled that this is being </v>

3151
02:57:35.951 --> 02:57:37.600
<v Speaker 5>considered with the exception of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>couple of notable commanders.</v>

3152
02:57:37.850 --> 02:57:38.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one commander,</v>

3153
02:57:38.781 --> 02:57:43.781
<v Speaker 5>one general supposedly looks like he'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>been hit in the head with a club when </v>

3154
02:57:43.781 --> 02:57:44.720
<v Speaker 5>somebody said that they were going over </v>
<v Speaker 5>to the attack.</v>

3155
02:57:44.990 --> 02:57:49.970
<v Speaker 5>His troops had been retreating for days </v>
<v Speaker 5>and days and days at an amazing pace.</v>

3156
02:57:49.971 --> 02:57:52.880
<v Speaker 5>They're closer in rags.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're weapons hardly fire.</v>

3157
02:57:52.881 --> 02:57:57.881
<v Speaker 5>Their shoes are falling off their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can't stand because they're so </v>

3158
02:57:57.881 --> 02:57:58.820
<v Speaker 5>sleepy and then you get the word that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to attack.</v>

3159
02:58:00.350 --> 02:58:02.010
<v Speaker 5>But several these French generals</v>

3160
02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:04.950
<v Speaker 1>that Jennifer has put in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>commander tough,</v>

3161
02:58:05.250 --> 02:58:07.260
<v Speaker 1>hardcore fighting generals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3162
02:58:07.590 --> 02:58:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Ferdinand Farash says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3163
02:58:09.500 --> 02:58:11.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during this encounter,</v>

3164
02:58:11.660 --> 02:58:12.710
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>attack,</v>

3165
02:58:12.711 --> 02:58:17.711
<v Speaker 5>whatever happens,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Germans are at the extreme limit of </v>

3166
02:58:17.711 --> 02:58:20.651
<v Speaker 5>their efforts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Victory will come to the side that </v>

3167
02:58:20.651 --> 02:58:20.651
<v Speaker 5>outlast the other,</v>

3168
02:58:20.651 --> 02:58:24.810
<v Speaker 1>and to quote the French general who </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes over from land resnick at the </v>

3169
02:58:24.810 --> 02:58:29.371
<v Speaker 1>fifth army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Jennifer fires him famously comes </v>

3170
02:58:29.371 --> 02:58:30.820
<v Speaker 1>to the phone like one second after he </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes command.</v>

3171
02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Here's from a commander in the scene </v>
<v Speaker 1>that says it's impossible.</v>

3172
02:58:33.371 --> 02:58:35.230
<v Speaker 1>His troops are falling down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tired.</v>

3173
02:58:35.231 --> 02:58:40.210
<v Speaker 1>They can't march and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>March or die and offer issues.</v>

3174
02:58:40.211 --> 02:58:45.211
<v Speaker 1>His famous notice to the army's when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>tells them that the great attack is </v>

3175
02:58:45.311 --> 02:58:49.750
<v Speaker 1>beginning and it's a classic stand or </v>
<v Speaker 1>die exhortation.</v>

3176
02:58:50.830 --> 02:58:53.020
<v Speaker 1>This is France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving it all on the table.</v>

3177
02:58:54.050 --> 02:58:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Jaffra announces the turnaround and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>

3178
02:58:57.880 --> 02:59:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Really the recommencement of contact </v>
<v Speaker 1>along the entire battle line,</v>

3179
02:59:02.261 --> 02:59:07.180
<v Speaker 1>and we've seen how deadly on a day to </v>
<v Speaker 1>day basis contact with the enemy in 20th</v>

3180
02:59:07.181 --> 02:59:10.840
<v Speaker 1>century warfare is he announces it </v>
<v Speaker 1>thusly quote,</v>

3181
02:59:11.770 --> 02:59:16.770
<v Speaker 5>we are about to engage in a battle on </v>
<v Speaker 5>which the fate of our country depends </v>

3182
02:59:16.770 --> 02:59:21.300
<v Speaker 5>and it is important to remind all ranks </v>
<v Speaker 5>that the moment has passed for looking </v>

3183
02:59:21.300 --> 02:59:25.681
<v Speaker 5>to the rear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All our efforts must be directed to </v>

3184
02:59:25.681 --> 02:59:28.411
<v Speaker 5>attacking and driving back the enemy </v>
<v Speaker 5>troops that can advance no farther must </v>

3185
02:59:28.411 --> 02:59:33.120
<v Speaker 5>at any price hold onto the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've conquered and die on the spot </v>

3186
02:59:33.120 --> 02:59:35.860
<v Speaker 5>rather than give way under the </v>
<v Speaker 5>circumstances which face us.</v>

3187
02:59:36.070 --> 02:59:36.950
<v Speaker 5>No active week,</v>

3188
02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:42.000
<v Speaker 1>yes can be tolerated and quote when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>general in charge of Paris Gal Yanni,</v>

3189
02:59:44.410 --> 02:59:47.590
<v Speaker 1>and I think I pronounced his name </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently every time I've said it,</v>

3190
02:59:48.820 --> 02:59:53.820
<v Speaker 1>but Galliani famously is asked by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>general of sixth army what their plans </v>

3191
02:59:54.251 --> 02:59:55.410
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're overrun,</v>

3192
02:59:55.570 --> 02:59:57.930
<v Speaker 1>you know what a Paris gets over running </v>
<v Speaker 1>the enemy over runs.</v>

3193
02:59:57.970 --> 02:59:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Where are we going to go and go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3194
02:59:59.551 --> 03:00:03.400
<v Speaker 1>and he looks at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just says nowhere.</v>

3195
03:00:04.770 --> 03:00:05.550
<v Speaker 6>This is it.</v>

3196
03:00:08.020 --> 03:00:11.830
<v Speaker 1>Imperial War Museum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oral historian Peter Harte describes the</v>

3197
03:00:11.831 --> 03:00:16.831
<v Speaker 1>crux of the battle of the Marne about as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well as anyone can in the short space of</v>

3198
03:00:16.961 --> 03:00:18.550
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

3199
03:00:18.551 --> 03:00:18.880
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

3200
03:00:19.180 --> 03:00:23.320
<v Speaker 5>what followed was a complex battle that </v>
<v Speaker 5>defies easy explanation.</v>

3201
03:00:23.560 --> 03:00:28.560
<v Speaker 5>By this time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the German right wing was actually </v>

3202
03:00:28.560 --> 03:00:30.601
<v Speaker 5>outnumbered by the French divisions </v>
<v Speaker 5>rushing up from the south as the German </v>

3203
03:00:30.601 --> 03:00:33.610
<v Speaker 5>first army tried to turn to face the </v>
<v Speaker 5>assault from the French sixth army along</v>

3204
03:00:33.611 --> 03:00:38.611
<v Speaker 5>the line of the river ORC,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a huge chasm of some 30 miles opened up </v>

3205
03:00:38.611 --> 03:00:42.250
<v Speaker 5>between cluck and the second army on his</v>
<v Speaker 5>left flank amidst the chaos,</v>

3206
03:00:42.370 --> 03:00:43.460
<v Speaker 5>the men of the B,</v>
<v Speaker 5>e,</v>

3207
03:00:43.461 --> 03:00:48.250
<v Speaker 5>f having beautifully about turned,</v>
<v Speaker 5>found themselves advancing alongside the</v>

3208
03:00:48.251 --> 03:00:52.840
<v Speaker 5>French fifth army into the gap between </v>
<v Speaker 5>the German first and second armies.</v>

3209
03:00:53.080 --> 03:00:55.750
<v Speaker 5>There was no great battle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no huge drama,</v>

3210
03:00:56.020 --> 03:01:00.550
<v Speaker 5>but the penetration between their armies</v>
<v Speaker 5>threatened utter for the Germans</v>

3211
03:01:00.700 --> 03:01:05.700
<v Speaker 1>and on the ninth of September,</v>
<v Speaker 1>von Moltke ordered his right wing to </v>

3212
03:01:05.700 --> 03:01:06.280
<v Speaker 1>retreat and to quote</v>

3213
03:01:08.060 --> 03:01:11.570
<v Speaker 1>now Peter Hearts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great reputable modern historian,</v>

3214
03:01:11.900 --> 03:01:16.900
<v Speaker 1>and that's about as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as wonderful a passage there as you </v>

3215
03:01:16.900 --> 03:01:17.480
<v Speaker 1>could ever hope to get from one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>

3216
03:01:17.481 --> 03:01:20.450
<v Speaker 1>but see if they would jettison some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their wonderful history,</v>

3217
03:01:20.451 --> 03:01:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Asante and throw a little juror and </v>
<v Speaker 1>drama,</v>

3218
03:01:23.590 --> 03:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe little exaggerations and romance </v>

3219
03:01:28.590 --> 03:01:31.241
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could get something like this from </v>

3220
03:01:31.241 --> 03:01:31.241
<v Speaker 1>Churchill who describes the same thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>as only he can.</v>

3221
03:01:31.880 --> 03:01:36.880
<v Speaker 1>And he says this about the British army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with the fringe advancing into </v>

3222
03:01:36.880 --> 03:01:41.201
<v Speaker 1>this crucial gap that will change this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole conflict and turn the battle of </v>

3223
03:01:41.201 --> 03:01:42.650
<v Speaker 1>the Marne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which let's be honest,</v>

3224
03:01:42.800 --> 03:01:47.800
<v Speaker 1>the French are once again taken it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chin when they're in full contact </v>

3225
03:01:47.800 --> 03:01:51.071
<v Speaker 1>with the fabulous German army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what we'll decide the occasion </v>

3226
03:01:51.071 --> 03:01:51.830
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Churchill puts it in Churchill,</v>

3227
03:01:51.831 --> 03:01:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Ian terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

3228
03:01:53.240 --> 03:01:57.500
<v Speaker 1>no human genius planned that the British</v>
<v Speaker 1>army should advance into this gap.</v>

3229
03:01:57.710 --> 03:02:02.360
<v Speaker 1>A series of tumultuous events had cast </v>
<v Speaker 1>them into this position in the line.</v>

3230
03:02:02.540 --> 03:02:07.540
<v Speaker 1>When they advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a gap in front of them on the </v>

3231
03:02:07.540 --> 03:02:10.511
<v Speaker 1>whole front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the line of least resistance </v>

3232
03:02:10.511 --> 03:02:13.360
<v Speaker 1>along it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They board and punched and it led into </v>

3233
03:02:13.360 --> 03:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>the strategic vitals of the German right</v>
<v Speaker 1>wing.</v>

3234
03:02:14.780 --> 03:02:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Hi Destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blind fate regulated the nun too </v>

3235
03:02:19.780 --> 03:02:21.740
<v Speaker 1>vigorous but nevertheless decisive </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements of this British army.</v>

3236
03:02:21.980 --> 03:02:26.980
<v Speaker 1>It marches on wondering what has </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to the monster which has </v>

3237
03:02:26.980 --> 03:02:30.701
<v Speaker 1>pursued it with weapon yell since Mom's </v>
<v Speaker 1>von Bulow finds his right wing being </v>

3238
03:02:30.701 --> 03:02:35.561
<v Speaker 1>rolled back by the fifth French army and</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself cutoff continually from his </v>

3239
03:02:35.561 --> 03:02:38.710
<v Speaker 1>right hand to comrade Kluk by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British advance Kluk.</v>

3240
03:02:38.810 --> 03:02:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Just as he's got himself into a position</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fight machinery finds his left and </v>

3241
03:02:43.941 --> 03:02:48.860
<v Speaker 1>all the rear of his left hopelessly </v>
<v Speaker 1>compromised and exposed and quote.</v>

3242
03:02:50.960 --> 03:02:53.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It reminds one of,</v>

3243
03:02:53.660 --> 03:02:58.660
<v Speaker 1>of of warfare in the 18th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to call it positional warfare </v>

3244
03:02:58.671 --> 03:03:00.620
<v Speaker 1>where a lot of the fighting was simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to,</v>

3245
03:03:00.780 --> 03:03:05.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>March around a flank or or get to a </v>

3246
03:03:05.780 --> 03:03:08.021
<v Speaker 1>point where you forced your enemy into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>place where they had to retreat just </v>

3247
03:03:08.021 --> 03:03:11.501
<v Speaker 1>because of positioning by accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Churchill so eloquently put it,</v>

3248
03:03:13.370 --> 03:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>the British army had almost accidentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>probed its way into the German liver.</v>

3249
03:03:21.100 --> 03:03:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't get much better than that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the high drama does it,</v>

3250
03:03:24.970 --> 03:03:29.970
<v Speaker 1>and it completely obscures the soldier's</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective on the ground of which we </v>

3251
03:03:30.701 --> 03:03:34.690
<v Speaker 1>have very little more and more firsthand</v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts,</v>

3252
03:03:34.691 --> 03:03:39.691
<v Speaker 1>especially from the German side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be made available as the war goes </v>

3253
03:03:39.691 --> 03:03:42.871
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep having to tell myself that a lot </v>

3254
03:03:42.871 --> 03:03:45.361
<v Speaker 1>of the people fighting in these battles </v>
<v Speaker 1>will never make it home to write their </v>

3255
03:03:45.361 --> 03:03:49.861
<v Speaker 1>memoirs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are people who don't get to go </v>

3256
03:03:49.861 --> 03:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>home until either the war is over or </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are so vitally injured.</v>

3257
03:03:51.731 --> 03:03:55.030
<v Speaker 1>They can't fight anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of the German soldiers on this</v>

3258
03:03:55.031 --> 03:04:00.031
<v Speaker 1>frontal might leave memoirs that someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>like yours truly might be lucky enough </v>

3259
03:04:00.031 --> 03:04:02.960
<v Speaker 1>to have translated into English,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave their bones on.</v>

3260
03:04:02.961 --> 03:04:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Some of these battlefields nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3261
03:04:06.590 --> 03:04:11.590
<v Speaker 1>one thing's clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading an account once and </v>

3262
03:04:11.590 --> 03:04:14.261
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of accounts like these and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can specifically find them in </v>

3263
03:04:14.261 --> 03:04:15.110
<v Speaker 1>publications that came out not long </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the war.</v>

3264
03:04:15.560 --> 03:04:18.200
<v Speaker 1>I remember I have one in my house </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually in many of you do too.</v>

3265
03:04:18.201 --> 03:04:23.201
<v Speaker 1>It's in a great series of books written </v>
<v Speaker 1>just after the war and you read it and </v>

3266
03:04:23.201 --> 03:04:25.070
<v Speaker 1>it's an account of this unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle.</v>

3267
03:04:25.071 --> 03:04:30.071
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like something out of the Lord</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the rings or some Napoleonic thing </v>

3268
03:04:30.071 --> 03:04:33.440
<v Speaker 1>with charges of 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>cavalry mowed down by canons.</v>

3269
03:04:33.441 --> 03:04:35.120
<v Speaker 1>These amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroic moments,</v>

3270
03:04:35.121 --> 03:04:37.070
<v Speaker 1>German heroism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French heroism,</v>

3271
03:04:37.400 --> 03:04:41.780
<v Speaker 1>really thrilling moving stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out that that's just one of</v>

3272
03:04:41.781 --> 03:04:43.820
<v Speaker 1>the little battles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3273
03:04:43.880 --> 03:04:47.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean comparatively that formed </v>
<v Speaker 1>something called the battle of Nancy.</v>

3274
03:04:47.600 --> 03:04:52.600
<v Speaker 1>The Battle of Nancy is just something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that formed a part of the battle of the </v>

3275
03:04:52.600 --> 03:04:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Marne.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are individual stories,</v>

3276
03:04:55.581 --> 03:05:00.581
<v Speaker 1>many battles whose names have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>forgotten by almost everyone that form </v>

3277
03:05:01.010 --> 03:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>the whole here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Battle of the Marne is that human </v>

3278
03:05:06.010 --> 03:05:10.181
<v Speaker 1>tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said earlier about what the </v>

3279
03:05:10.181 --> 03:05:11.981
<v Speaker 1>civilians are suffering on a mass scale </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the drama and the suffering and the </v>

3280
03:05:11.981 --> 03:05:15.461
<v Speaker 1>heroism and the stories that would break</v>
<v Speaker 1>our hearts if we knew them are going on </v>

3281
03:05:15.461 --> 03:05:18.440
<v Speaker 1>up and down the line from Switzerland to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Belgian border.</v>

3282
03:05:18.440 --> 03:05:23.440
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going on in the eastern front </v>

3283
03:05:23.440 --> 03:05:25.571
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't even talked about the </v>

3284
03:05:25.571 --> 03:05:25.571
<v Speaker 1>simultaneous events that are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While this is going on,</v>

3285
03:05:25.820 --> 03:05:27.090
<v Speaker 1>the armies of Luton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dorfman,</v>

3286
03:05:27.110 --> 03:05:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Hindenburg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the east are wrapping up their </v>

3287
03:05:32.110 --> 03:05:34.211
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're against renon comps army after </v>

3288
03:05:34.211 --> 03:05:36.581
<v Speaker 1>Tannenberg in Galicia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is over kind of were </v>

3289
03:05:36.581 --> 03:05:39.440
<v Speaker 1>austro-hungarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poland and Russian interests meet.</v>

3290
03:05:39.441 --> 03:05:44.441
<v Speaker 1>There are terrible battles going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Austro-hungarian Hungarians are </v>

3291
03:05:44.441 --> 03:05:44.660
<v Speaker 1>getting smashed in a way that they will </v>
<v Speaker 1>never recover from,</v>

3292
03:05:44.810 --> 03:05:47.240
<v Speaker 1>and this is all happening at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3293
03:05:48.020 --> 03:05:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Part of what makes this conflict so </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorienting for everyone who's facing </v>

3294
03:05:53.020 --> 03:05:57.701
<v Speaker 1>it is how quickly it's all happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about the Second World </v>

3295
03:05:57.701 --> 03:05:57.701
<v Speaker 1>War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

3296
03:05:57.701 --> 03:06:02.140
<v Speaker 1>realize that there's no big fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the major powers for about eight</v>

3297
03:06:02.751 --> 03:06:05.420
<v Speaker 1>months after the Second World War is </v>
<v Speaker 1>declared.</v>

3298
03:06:05.421 --> 03:06:07.460
<v Speaker 1>Hitler goes into Poland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poland falls fast.</v>

3299
03:06:07.630 --> 03:06:12.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's all quick and relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>painless by world war standards.</v>

3300
03:06:12.890 --> 03:06:15.350
<v Speaker 1>It'll be eight months before the Germans</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in,</v>

3301
03:06:15.710 --> 03:06:18.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real big contact with French and British</v>

3302
03:06:18.470 --> 03:06:23.470
<v Speaker 1>armies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was three weeks old and all the </v>

3303
03:06:23.470 --> 03:06:26.951
<v Speaker 1>major participants have clashed head on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more than a million people dead.</v>

3304
03:06:27.920 --> 03:06:32.920
<v Speaker 1>This is the worst nightmare of every </v>
<v Speaker 1>prewar profit predicting what was going </v>

3305
03:06:34.641 --> 03:06:39.320
<v Speaker 1>to happen when you combined the mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>armies that the Napoleonic era unleashed</v>

3306
03:06:39.380 --> 03:06:44.380
<v Speaker 1>on steroids by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the modern technology and weapons </v>

3307
03:06:44.380 --> 03:06:48.050
<v Speaker 1>and systems that were being developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>all through the 18 hundreds.</v>

3308
03:06:48.710 --> 03:06:53.150
<v Speaker 1>This is a great filter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you lose more than a million people</v>

3309
03:06:53.270 --> 03:06:56.280
<v Speaker 1>in the first blink of an eye and the is </v>
<v Speaker 1>now</v>

3310
03:06:56.640 --> 03:07:01.640
<v Speaker 5>obviously going to last a while,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many people are going to die before </v>

3311
03:07:01.640 --> 03:07:05.160
<v Speaker 5>this thing reaches a resolution?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is the resolution</v>

3312
03:07:07.070 --> 03:07:08.300
<v Speaker 5>again?</v>
<v Speaker 5>To simplify it?</v>

3313
03:07:08.301 --> 03:07:13.301
<v Speaker 5>What really happens is when the entire </v>
<v Speaker 5>French and British line turns around and</v>

3314
03:07:13.371 --> 03:07:18.371
<v Speaker 5>smashes back into the German line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's one spot where they just </v>

3315
03:07:18.371 --> 03:07:22.540
<v Speaker 5>penetrate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing really in front of them </v>

3316
03:07:22.540 --> 03:07:22.790
<v Speaker 5>and that's the spot that the BDF,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the British expeditionary force and some</v>

3317
03:07:22.791 --> 03:07:27.791
<v Speaker 5>French forces go through and see head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Vaughn and von Bulow not already been </v>

3318
03:07:29.781 --> 03:07:34.781
<v Speaker 5>fighting somebody they could have turned</v>
<v Speaker 5>and crushed these forces that we're </v>

3319
03:07:34.781 --> 03:07:39.461
<v Speaker 5>penetrating into that gap,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they are fighting other people </v>

3320
03:07:39.461 --> 03:07:43.331
<v Speaker 5>that's known as pinning the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Clucas fighting those forces that are </v>

3321
03:07:43.331 --> 03:07:47.141
<v Speaker 5>coming at him from Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Von Bulow is fighting other armies so </v>

3322
03:07:47.141 --> 03:07:48.230
<v Speaker 5>they can't turn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if they do turn than the armies they</v>

3323
03:07:48.231 --> 03:07:49.790
<v Speaker 5>were fighting or hitting them in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>back,</v>

3324
03:07:50.210 --> 03:07:55.210
<v Speaker 5>they're trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only thing they can do to alleviate </v>

3325
03:07:55.210 --> 03:07:59.170
<v Speaker 5>this open flank issue is to pull back </v>
<v Speaker 5>von Moltke when all this is going on,</v>

3326
03:08:03.040 --> 03:08:06.760
<v Speaker 5>falls apart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you ask me,</v>

3327
03:08:06.880 --> 03:08:11.880
<v Speaker 5>understandably so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a guy who's been under </v>

3328
03:08:11.880 --> 03:08:15.930
<v Speaker 5>tremendous pressure already and as he </v>
<v Speaker 5>watches this plan,</v>

3329
03:08:17.380 --> 03:08:22.380
<v Speaker 5>so important that for years it had been </v>
<v Speaker 5>known as dare tog the day when this plan</v>

3330
03:08:23.171 --> 03:08:24.430
<v Speaker 5>is finally used.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3331
03:08:24.431 --> 03:08:25.990
<v Speaker 5>whatever the heck the plan was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really,</v>

3332
03:08:25.991 --> 03:08:29.170
<v Speaker 5>this day means the day that the Germans </v>
<v Speaker 5>launched the war,</v>

3333
03:08:29.860 --> 03:08:32.170
<v Speaker 5>he's watching it collapsed in front of </v>
<v Speaker 5>his eyes,</v>

3334
03:08:33.340 --> 03:08:38.170
<v Speaker 5>realizing also that this will all be </v>
<v Speaker 5>blamed on him.</v>

3335
03:08:38.171 --> 03:08:39.970
<v Speaker 5>He's coming apart at the seams</v>

3336
03:08:41.890 --> 03:08:46.260
<v Speaker 5>he writes to his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Has all of this is becoming clear quote,</v>

3337
03:08:46.930 --> 03:08:51.930
<v Speaker 5>I cannot find words to describe the </v>
<v Speaker 5>crushing responsibility that is weight </v>

3338
03:08:51.930 --> 03:08:55.000
<v Speaker 5>upon my shoulders during the last few </v>
<v Speaker 5>days and still weighs on me today.</v>

3339
03:08:55.420 --> 03:08:58.060
<v Speaker 5>The appalling difficulties of our </v>
<v Speaker 5>present situation.</v>

3340
03:08:58.061 --> 03:09:02.020
<v Speaker 5>Hang before my eyes like a dark curtain </v>
<v Speaker 5>through which I can see nothing.</v>

3341
03:09:03.430 --> 03:09:07.240
<v Speaker 5>And to quote one of UNMOLD costs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Staff officers,</v>

03:09:08.110 --> 03:09:11.140
<v Speaker 5>a colonel named Bauer wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote,</v>

3343

<v Speaker 5>desperate panics seized severely the </v>
<v Speaker 5>entire army or to be more correct.</v>

3344
03:09:16.120 --> 03:09:21.120
<v Speaker 5>The greater part of its leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looked at its worst at the supreme </v>

3345
03:09:21.120 --> 03:09:22.510
<v Speaker 5>command.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Multaka completely collapsed.</v>

3346
03:09:22.660 --> 03:09:26.080
<v Speaker 5>He sat with a Pallid face gazing at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>map dead.</v>

3347
03:09:26.081 --> 03:09:30.250
<v Speaker 5>Do all feeling a broken man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>End Quote.</v>

3348
03:09:32.340 --> 03:09:37.340
<v Speaker 5>Churchill was sympathetic when he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>quote everything now converged upon </v>

3349
03:09:38.260 --> 03:09:40.140
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was [inaudible].</v>

3350
03:09:40.380 --> 03:09:45.380
<v Speaker 5>He was the shadow of a great name.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was the nephew of the old field </v>

3351
03:09:45.380 --> 03:09:48.750
<v Speaker 5>marshal and had been his aide de camp.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was an ordinary man rather,</v>

3352
03:09:48.751 --> 03:09:50.910
<v Speaker 5>according air,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a man about the palace,</v>

3353

<v Speaker 5>agreeable to the emperor in the me of </v>
<v Speaker 5>peace,</v>

3354
03:09:54.070 --> 03:09:59.070
<v Speaker 1>the sort of man who does not make too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much trouble with the sovereign who </v>

3355
03:09:59.070 --> 03:09:59.500
<v Speaker 1>knows how to suppress his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

3356
03:09:59.590 --> 03:10:01.960
<v Speaker 1>what there is of it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the brutal remorseless,</v>

03:10:08.680 --> 03:10:13.680
<v Speaker 1>centripetal impingement of tides and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compulsion's under which the greatest </v>

3360
03:10:13.680 --> 03:10:17.731
<v Speaker 1>captains of history might have blanched </v>
<v Speaker 1>and quote Multaka had later written </v>

3361
03:10:18.730 --> 03:10:23.080
<v Speaker 1>while he still lived that in the moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>of supreme crisis,</v>

3362
03:10:23.081 --> 03:10:28.081
<v Speaker 1>he had grown quite nervous and quote </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of sources.</v>

3363
03:10:31.831 --> 03:10:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Report that von Mold Cup went to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kaiser at this point and said,</v>

3364
03:10:36.181 --> 03:10:38.580
<v Speaker 1>majesty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just lost the war.</v>

3365
03:10:39.820 --> 03:10:42.150
<v Speaker 1>I have never been able to confirm that </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

3366
03:10:42.890 --> 03:10:46.470
<v Speaker 1>and truth be told they didn't lose the </v>
<v Speaker 1>war here.</v>

3367
03:10:47.900 --> 03:10:52.900
<v Speaker 1>What's just happened is the chances for </v>
<v Speaker 1>an early knockout blow an outright </v>

3368
03:10:52.900 --> 03:10:55.340
<v Speaker 1>German victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's been compromised,</v>

3369
03:10:55.341 --> 03:10:58.250
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to say compromise because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an open question.</v>

3370
03:10:58.251 --> 03:11:03.251
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not the Germans blew this or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the French simply rallied and gain the </v>

3371
03:11:04.011 --> 03:11:07.490
<v Speaker 1>victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are lots of mistakes on the German</v>

3372
03:11:07.491 --> 03:11:11.480
<v Speaker 1>side that people will point to basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>insinuating that without those mistakes,</v>

3373
03:11:11.630 --> 03:11:16.630
<v Speaker 1>the French go down and yet look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that they were still there after </v>

3374
03:11:17.751 --> 03:11:22.751
<v Speaker 1>suffering unprecedented levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties and punishment</v>

3375
03:11:24.920 --> 03:11:29.920
<v Speaker 1>and forget about that for a minute and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the condition that those </v>

3376
03:11:29.920 --> 03:11:31.670
<v Speaker 1>armies are in before they turn around at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the battle of the Marne.</v>

3377
03:11:31.880 --> 03:11:34.730
<v Speaker 1>They are falling apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dead on their feet,</v>

3378
03:11:35.060 --> 03:11:40.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing rags and unable to keep their </v>

3379
03:11:40.060 --> 03:11:42.200
<v Speaker 1>eyes open and that's who the general </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the first army,</v>

3380
03:11:42.201 --> 03:11:47.201
<v Speaker 1>von Cluck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's who he singles out when he talks </v>

3381
03:11:47.201 --> 03:11:50.090
<v Speaker 1>about the part you know of this war so </v>
<v Speaker 1>far that surprised him.</v>

3382
03:11:50.840 --> 03:11:55.010
<v Speaker 1>He wrote quote that men will let </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves be killed where they stand is</v>

3383
03:11:55.011 --> 03:11:58.610
<v Speaker 1>a well known thing and counted on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>every plan of battle,</v>

3384
03:11:58.940 --> 03:12:03.940
<v Speaker 1>but that men who have retreated for 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>days sleeping on the ground and half </v>

3385
03:12:03.940 --> 03:12:08.591
<v Speaker 1>dead with fatigue should be able to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>up their rifles and attack when the </v>

3386
03:12:08.591 --> 03:12:12.551
<v Speaker 1>bugle sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a thing upon which we never </v>

3387
03:12:12.551 --> 03:12:15.341
<v Speaker 1>counted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a possibility not studied in our </v>

3388
03:12:15.341 --> 03:12:15.440
<v Speaker 1>war academy and quote.</v>

3389
03:12:17.210 --> 03:12:22.210
<v Speaker 1>So he was obviously impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to deny and,</v>

3390
03:12:22.581 --> 03:12:24.620
<v Speaker 1>and listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to shortchange the British</v>

3391
03:12:24.621 --> 03:12:29.621
<v Speaker 1>expeditionary force either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they proved to be potentially </v>

3392
03:12:29.621 --> 03:12:31.580
<v Speaker 1>crucial to this whole thing and as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Churchill pointed out,</v>

3393
03:12:31.581 --> 03:12:35.510
<v Speaker 1>sort of providential he at the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>place and at the right time sometimes,</v>

3394
03:12:35.960 --> 03:12:40.960
<v Speaker 1>but this is one of those victories where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have to tip your hat a little </v>

3395
03:12:40.960 --> 03:12:43.430
<v Speaker 1>bit to what the French achieved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is monumental stuff.</v>

3396
03:12:43.740 --> 03:12:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is truly heroic.</v>

3397
03:12:45.621 --> 03:12:47.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a little like the Alamo for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>

3398
03:12:47.841 --> 03:12:52.841
<v Speaker 1>but on an enormous scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time I want to remember </v>

3399
03:12:52.841 --> 03:12:55.490
<v Speaker 1>the Germans in all this too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we said earlier,</v>

3400
03:12:56.120 --> 03:13:01.120
<v Speaker 1>they get a bad rap from a lot of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the Second World War and </v>

3401
03:13:01.281 --> 03:13:06.281
<v Speaker 1>rightly so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of that is connected to the </v>

3402
03:13:06.281 --> 03:13:06.281
<v Speaker 1>first world war in a funny way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see them,</v>

3403
03:13:06.530 --> 03:13:11.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to bring up some sort of science </v>

3404
03:13:11.530 --> 03:13:11.530
<v Speaker 1>fiction reference.</v>

3405
03:13:11.530 --> 03:13:11.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where would that come from?</v>

3406
03:13:11.530 --> 03:13:15.071
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're a little like an akin </v>

3407
03:13:15.071 --> 03:13:15.071
<v Speaker 1>skywalker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3408
03:13:15.071 --> 03:13:17.240
<v Speaker 1>this nation that's new and young and has</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much promise and potential.</v>

3409
03:13:17.630 --> 03:13:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Hg Wells had the greatest name for them </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever heard at this point.</v>

3410
03:13:20.751 --> 03:13:24.890
<v Speaker 1>He called them the best and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wickedest nation in the world.</v>

3411
03:13:25.190 --> 03:13:27.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the militarism that so scared him in his</v>

3412
03:13:27.711 --> 03:13:32.660
<v Speaker 1>socialistic sensibilities was balanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>out by the fact that the Germans were so</v>

3413
03:13:32.661 --> 03:13:36.020
<v Speaker 1>admirable in so many respects what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans called color tour,</v>

3414
03:13:36.200 --> 03:13:41.200
<v Speaker 1>their music and their and their writings</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their sophistication and and and </v>

3415
03:13:41.200 --> 03:13:42.140
<v Speaker 1>their science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my gosh,</v>

3416
03:13:42.141 --> 03:13:47.141
<v Speaker 1>and their education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wells is overflowing with all these </v>

3417
03:13:47.141 --> 03:13:49.691
<v Speaker 1>wonderful things to say about Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've got this flaw and it's this </v>

3418
03:13:49.691 --> 03:13:53.120
<v Speaker 1>militarism and they're the best and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wicked is people in Europe and somewhere</v>

3419
03:13:53.121 --> 03:13:56.840
<v Speaker 1>along the line and akin skywalker turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>into darth vader in the poor.</v>

3420
03:13:56.841 --> 03:14:01.841
<v Speaker 1>Germans get that to be their image for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century.</v>

3421
03:14:02.510 --> 03:14:07.510
<v Speaker 1>You wonder again what the enormous </v>
<v Speaker 1>stakes of this in a German really defeat</v>

3422
03:14:08.900 --> 03:14:11.440
<v Speaker 1>our.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If unmold can.</v>

3423
03:14:11.450 --> 03:14:16.450
<v Speaker 1>The Germans had been victorious here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The entire German history in the 20th </v>

3424
03:14:16.450 --> 03:14:17.990
<v Speaker 1>century is different and perhaps much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

3425
03:14:17.991 --> 03:14:22.991
<v Speaker 1>much more positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost certainly for Germans and for </v>

3426
03:14:22.991 --> 03:14:23.390
<v Speaker 1>everyone else too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

3427
03:14:24.820 --> 03:14:26.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a very interesting what if </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario,</v>

3428
03:14:28.040 --> 03:14:33.040
<v Speaker 1>and it's important to remember that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about these soldiers dying on </v>

3429
03:14:33.040 --> 03:14:33.590
<v Speaker 1>the ground in these nameless awful </v>
<v Speaker 1>battles,</v>

3430
03:14:33.890 --> 03:14:35.360
<v Speaker 1>whether they be French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>British,</v>

3431
03:14:35.540 --> 03:14:37.460
<v Speaker 1>German,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or very soon,</v>

3432
03:14:37.461 --> 03:14:42.100
<v Speaker 1>a lot more people from Canada and South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa and Australia and India,</v>

3433
03:14:42.101 --> 03:14:47.101
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is going to become an </v>

3434
03:14:47.101 --> 03:14:48.641
<v Speaker 1>internationalized war soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these people are good people caught </v>

3435
03:14:48.641 --> 03:14:48.960
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3436
03:14:48.961 --> 03:14:50.540
<v Speaker 1>they're just people caught up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3437
03:14:50.570 --> 03:14:55.570
<v Speaker 1>in the grand plans and grinding wheels </v>
<v Speaker 1>of of nation states.</v>

3438
03:14:56.750 --> 03:15:00.830
<v Speaker 1>They went into these conflicts for </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons that are understandable today,</v>

3439
03:15:01.520 --> 03:15:05.570
<v Speaker 1>patriotism duty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love of country to protect your family,</v>

3440
03:15:05.571 --> 03:15:10.571
<v Speaker 1>all those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also went for reasons that were </v>

3441
03:15:10.571 --> 03:15:11.270
<v Speaker 1>really important still in the 19th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

3442
03:15:11.660 --> 03:15:15.680
<v Speaker 1>but that are a little different today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glory heroism,</v>

3443
03:15:15.710 --> 03:15:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Romance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

3444
03:15:17.271 --> 03:15:20.480
<v Speaker 1>they still exist but not quite like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>did back.</v>

3445
03:15:21.020 --> 03:15:22.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning of history,</v>

3446
03:15:22.461 --> 03:15:25.760
<v Speaker 1>until right around this time in </v>
<v Speaker 1>September 19,</v>

3447
03:15:25.761 --> 03:15:30.761
<v Speaker 1>14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a general named von [inaudible] talked </v>

3448
03:15:30.761 --> 03:15:34.331
<v Speaker 1>about the changes that this first month </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the first world war and created in </v>

3449
03:15:34.331 --> 03:15:37.040
<v Speaker 1>that facade of romantic war when he said</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

3450
03:15:37.340 --> 03:15:42.340
<v Speaker 1>if war was once a chivalrous dual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's now a dastardly slaughter and </v>

3451
03:15:43.070 --> 03:15:43.550
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

3452
03:15:45.040 --> 03:15:48.270
<v Speaker 1>the suffering on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of which side you're on,</v>

3453
03:15:48.271 --> 03:15:52.230
<v Speaker 1>is pitiable and horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3454
03:15:52.280 --> 03:15:57.280
<v Speaker 1>I always try to make sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I hope I'm successful at this that </v>

3455
03:15:57.280 --> 03:16:01.220
<v Speaker 1>were never exploitive of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the terrible things that are going on</v>

3456
03:16:01.221 --> 03:16:03.030
<v Speaker 1>to the people in these stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We retell.</v>

3457
03:16:04.050 --> 03:16:06.990
<v Speaker 1>The reason that I use them is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

3458
03:16:07.350 --> 03:16:12.300
<v Speaker 1>these stories intrigue me because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>always put myself in them and then I try</v>

3459
03:16:12.301 --> 03:16:17.301
<v Speaker 1>to imagine handling these things and as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a person who's interested in the </v>

3460
03:16:17.791 --> 03:16:22.791
<v Speaker 1>extremes of human experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are almost no exceptions to the </v>

3461
03:16:23.641 --> 03:16:26.040
<v Speaker 1>stories we talk about on this program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine it.</v>

3462
03:16:26.700 --> 03:16:31.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like I would wilt under the </v>

3463
03:16:31.700 --> 03:16:32.220
<v Speaker 1>pressures that these people lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

3464
03:16:34.240 --> 03:16:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about being interested in </v>

3465
03:16:39.240 --> 03:16:42.641
<v Speaker 1>the extremes of human nature and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering what I would do in the same </v>

3466
03:16:42.641 --> 03:16:46.961
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about the worst places in the </v>

3467
03:16:46.961 --> 03:16:46.961
<v Speaker 1>world you can think of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3468
03:16:46.961 --> 03:16:49.370
<v Speaker 1>and if there's a top three or four or </v>
<v Speaker 1>five lists out there,</v>

3469
03:16:49.700 --> 03:16:54.700
<v Speaker 1>one of them on my list is the western </v>
<v Speaker 1>front in the first world war and we're </v>

3470
03:16:54.700 --> 03:16:59.651
<v Speaker 1>about to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is about the worst experience in </v>

3471
03:16:59.651 --> 03:16:59.651
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

3472
03:17:06.330 --> 03:17:08.790
<v Speaker 1>I was joking on the hardcore history </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter feed,</v>

3473
03:17:09.150 --> 03:17:14.150
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can follow it at hardcore history </v>

3474
03:17:14.150 --> 03:17:17.480
<v Speaker 1>that it's taking us longer to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode you've just heard released and </v>

3475
03:17:17.671 --> 03:17:19.170
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

3476
03:17:19.171 --> 03:17:21.570
<v Speaker 1>thank you for your patients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always appreciated.</v>

3477
03:17:22.150 --> 03:17:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Then the amount of time that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually covered in the episode itself.</v>

3478
03:17:26.810 --> 03:17:31.520
<v Speaker 1>And I think if you were crunching the </v>
<v Speaker 1>data and projecting outward based on how</v>

3479
03:17:31.521 --> 03:17:36.521
<v Speaker 1>long the show you just heard was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've probably figured that it's going </v>

3480
03:17:36.521 --> 03:17:38.810
<v Speaker 1>to take us about 250 episodes to cover </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first world war.</v>

3481
03:17:38.811 --> 03:17:40.880
<v Speaker 1>And God forbid we go afterwards and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

3482
03:17:40.881 --> 03:17:45.881
<v Speaker 1>19 and the treaties and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll be doing this the rest of our </v>

3483
03:17:45.881 --> 03:17:46.100
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're obviously not going to do that.</v>

3484
03:17:46.140 --> 03:17:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the episode you just heard focused on,</v>

3485
03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:52.550
<v Speaker 1>to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a series of events,</v>

3486
03:17:52.551 --> 03:17:57.551
<v Speaker 1>the prewar stuff and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first and opening moves that's </v>

3487
03:17:57.551 --> 03:18:00.230
<v Speaker 1>common in almost all the approaches of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first world war because they set the</v>

3488
03:18:00.231 --> 03:18:02.210
<v Speaker 1>stage for what comes afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

3489
03:18:02.570 --> 03:18:04.040
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3490
03:18:04.041 --> 03:18:08.840
<v Speaker 1>as this story ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trenches are cropping up organically</v>

3491
03:18:08.960 --> 03:18:13.390
<v Speaker 1>along the western front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the iconic image of the first World</v>

3492
03:18:13.390 --> 03:18:13.600
<v Speaker 1>War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3493
03:18:13.601 --> 03:18:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Trenches have always been known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortifications always been known.</v>

3494
03:18:16.181 --> 03:18:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Going back to ancient history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but never on this scale,</v>

3495
03:18:19.780 --> 03:18:22.360
<v Speaker 1>never this long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never in positions,</v>

3496
03:18:22.730 --> 03:18:27.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're on as almost immobile as </v>

3497
03:18:27.730 --> 03:18:27.730
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never under these sorts of conditions.</v>

3498
03:18:27.730 --> 03:18:31.951
<v Speaker 1>It's going to create an almost unique </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience for the people who have to go</v>

3499
03:18:32.461 --> 03:18:32.940
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>

3500
03:18:33.910 --> 03:18:38.910
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something fascinating when I consider </v>

3501
03:18:38.910 --> 03:18:40.090
<v Speaker 1>how I myself would have behaved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar circumstances,</v>

3502
03:18:41.020 --> 03:18:45.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to make the battles </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat similar,</v>

3503
03:18:45.780 --> 03:18:50.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you'll be able to a little bit about </v>

3504
03:18:50.780 --> 03:18:53.970
<v Speaker 1>the big ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not have to go too much into the </v>

3505
03:18:53.970 --> 03:18:56.341
<v Speaker 1>experience over and over again because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes similar in each of the </v>

3506
03:18:56.341 --> 03:19:00.121
<v Speaker 1>battles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people fighting in the trenches in </v>

3507
03:19:00.121 --> 03:19:01.831
<v Speaker 1>one battle often have similar sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>day to day experiences from people </v>

3508
03:19:01.831 --> 03:19:03.460
<v Speaker 1>fighting in the trenches in another </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle.</v>

3509
03:19:03.760 --> 03:19:08.760
<v Speaker 1>So we will have the opportunity as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>program moves along to zoom in and zoom </v>

3510
03:19:08.760 --> 03:19:13.471
<v Speaker 1>out as needed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is going to allow us though to </v>

3511
03:19:13.471 --> 03:19:17.551
<v Speaker 1>focus on a bunch of other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including how the generals managed to </v>

3512
03:19:17.551 --> 03:19:20.080
<v Speaker 1>deal with the fact that they're no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer operating with prewar plans.</v>

3513
03:19:20.230 --> 03:19:24.850
<v Speaker 1>They have to actually think now learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apply their thinking in novel ways.</v>

3514
03:19:24.850 --> 03:19:29.850
<v Speaker 1>We're going to find out how flexible </v>
<v Speaker 1>these 19th century men are as they try </v>

3515
03:19:29.850 --> 03:19:34.171
<v Speaker 1>to adjust on the fly in real time to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges of 20th century warfare,</v>

3516
03:19:35.230 --> 03:19:40.230
<v Speaker 1>which no one's ever really tried yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have to contend with </v>

3517
03:19:40.230 --> 03:19:43.090
<v Speaker 1>and we are going to deal with questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>like changes in the air,</v>

3518
03:19:44.050 --> 03:19:49.050
<v Speaker 1>changes at c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes involving WMD and things we're </v>

3519
03:19:49.511 --> 03:19:54.511
<v Speaker 1>still dealing with today and changes </v>
<v Speaker 1>involving the scope of this war that </v>

3520
03:19:55.871 --> 03:19:57.610
<v Speaker 1>encompasses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3521
03:19:57.611 --> 03:20:00.640
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world basically in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>way or another.</v>

3522
03:20:01.660 --> 03:20:06.580
<v Speaker 1>The first world war is about to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>global and underground.</v>

3523
03:20:07.330 --> 03:20:10.990
<v Speaker 1>In the next episode of blueprint for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Armageddon,</v>

3524
03:20:18.810 --> 03:20:23.810
<v Speaker 1>we just want to make it clear that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are bought and paid for around </v>
