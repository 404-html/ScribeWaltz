Speaker 1:          00:00          So you know, now I want to talk about postmodernism a little bit. Well, it seems to me that's my youth, Michel Foucault in the Middle, and the more reprehensible individual you could partly ever discover or even dream up, no matter how twisted your imagination and a food co and Dera Dahlia would say, there's more, but I would say they're the two architects of the, of the, of the postmodernist movement, and in brief, I think what they did was in the late sixties and early seventies, they were avowed Marxist some way low way after anyone with any shred of ethical decency had stopped being a Marxist by that time, even John Paul Sartre and woken up enough to figure out that the Soviets hadn't ushered into the Kingdom of Heaven. Now he had evidence stretching back 45 years that he could have attended to if he would have been willing to open his eyes, talk about bad faith, which was his ethical critique.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Essentially. It's something quite staggering. The postmodernists knew that they were pretty much done with regards to pushing their classic Marxism by the late sixties in the early seventies because the evidence that Stella Russia not only Stalinists, certainly lennon was no, no saint by any stretch of the imagination. That killing certainly got underway while he was still alive and and continued after Stalin was dead as well, although perhaps with not the same degree of brutality and efficiency. And then there was a course Mao's China where the estimates, you know, nobody knows how many people died under mile, but the estimates are run as high as $100, million people, which actually turns out to be quite a few people in the fact that we can't keep count accurately without an error margin of something in the tens of millions just tells you exactly how horrible the situation was. They transformed the Marxist dialogue of rich versus poor into oppressed versus oppressor and Fuko in particular, who never fit in anywhere and who was an outcast in many ways and a bitter one in a suicidal one his entire life.

Speaker 1:          02:06          Did everything he possibly could with is staggering Iq to figure out every treacherous way possible to undermine the structure that wouldn't accept him in all his peculiarity and it's no wonder because there would be no way of making a structure that could possibly function if it was composed of people who were as peculiar, bitter and resentful as Michelle Foodco, so you couldn't imagine this functioning society that would be composed of individuals with his particular makeup. In any case, he did put his brain to work trying to figure out a way how to resurrect Marxism under a new guys, let's say, and B, how to justify the fact that it wasn't his problem, that he was an outsider. It was actually everyone else's problem and he did a pretty damn good job of that. Laid the groundwork for this, for the, what would you call it, the rise of the marginalized against the center and is thinking is very much the same.

Speaker 1:          03:00          You know, Derek, even though my fuco and Derrida hated each other and regard each other as intellectual charlatans, which was about the only thing either of them was ever really correct about, so Derrida was also dared in some ways is even more treacherous thinker because he makes the claim in some sense that I a political system has a center around which the majority congregate. Let's say it's, it's, it's quite similar to food co's analysis and that there are, there are people who are outside the category system and then which is obviously true because no matter how you categorize people, there are certain people inside the category and certain people outside. That's actually why you categorize things, right? Because if every category holds every entity, then every, every cognitive operation is infinitely complex. You can't manage that way to categorize. You have to include an excluded.

Speaker 1:          04:00          It's the very nature of categorization and you can't just scrap categorization because without simplification and categorization, you actually can't function in the world. You just die, right? You die of excess stress. It's something like something like that happens to schizophrenia people because their category systems break down and they're completely incapable of functioning in the world as a consequence of that. Anyways. Um, then you know, uh, Derrida went and flew co as well, went a step farther and this is one of the incredibly crooked elements of their thinking. I think another slight of hand which was well category systems exclude political systems, exclude economic systems, exclude any hierarchy of value. Excludes obviously because if there is a hierarchy of value, some things are more valuable than others and the less valuable things are excluded because otherwise it wouldn't be a hierarchy of value. But the next claim they essentially make is that the reason that those hierarchies of value are constructed isn't to produce whatever it is that's a value, but to exclude and to maintain the structure of power that's intrinsic to the hierarchy of value.

Speaker 1:          05:06          And that's a, that's an unbelievably crooked claim because there are multiple reasons why a hierarchy of value might be put into place there. Hierarchies of beauty and there's hierarchies of competence, hierarchies of intelligence and and attractiveness and, and athletic ability and musical talent. There's multiple hierarchies. And in order for those things to exist at a high order, in order for us to, to, to, to laud, what would you say? Musical genius. We have to excuse all the people. We have to exclude all the people who can only squawk their clarinet from the hierarchy because otherwise you don't have any music and there's no option. There's no direction. And so to claim that the purpose of the hierarchy is to exclude is unbelievably crooked and it's central claim for both, for both Fuko and and Dera. That's one of those slights of hands that people don't quite notice, but that have absolutely catastrophic effects.

Speaker 1:          06:01          Now for food co and Derrida, you could, here's how you could imagine their world essentially. Um, you know, for the, for the philosopher Hobbes, life was nasty, brutish and short, and people were at each other's throats in the state of nature, right? But Hobbs really thought about that as a, as a, as the chaos of individuals. And he believed that a central authority had to exert force in order to organize that intrinsic chaos so that some degree of peace could rain. It's kind of the opposite of John Shaw crusoe's theory, which was that human beings were intrinsically good and, and the state the government was intrinsically bad, and that all of what made people evil derive from the state. Um, I would say if you put hobbes and Rousseau together, you actually get the truth, even though they do seem to be coming at it from opposite perspectives because people are actually good and evil and social structures are also good and evil.

Speaker 1:          06:59          And you know, it's paradoxical and we don't like paradoxical categories, but that's still how it is. What, what Fuco and Derrida and the postmodernists did was that they kind of added the collective element to that. So there are hobbsy and world isn't a world of individuals struggling against one another in the initial state of war, like nature. It's, it's groups of individuals bound by whatever their identity happens to be struggling against each other for power. Because in the postmodern, neo Marxist universe, there's nothing but power. And there's a variety of reasons for that. Partly it's because the postmodernists don't admit that there are any standards outside of arbitrary opinion, essentially they don't really believe in the real world, which is why they can generate critiques of science, for example, which is increasingly characterized is nothing but part of the euro centric patriarchies, um, what would you call desire to impose their power structure on the rest of the world despite the fact that it also makes planes fly and computers operate and, and well, you know, yeah, exactly.

Speaker 1:          08:05          So, and it's a rare bloody, um, social justice warrior that doesn't have an iphone or a android, that wouldn't work if quantum mechanics wasn't actually correct because the fact that quantum mechanics is correct is one of the reasons why these unbelievably highly developed pieces of technology actually functioned. So they bitch and whine about the patriarchal, patriarchal underpinnings of Eurocentric Science and use the gadgets all the time to aggregate, to complain about it. So it's really pretty appalling. So anyways, anyways, the worldview of the, of the postmodern neo marxists is that everybody is basically not an individual because that's really a fiction. And a eurocentric, patriarchal fiction at that, but a member of whatever their identity group happens to be and there's no real possibility of communication between identity groups, hence phenomena like cultural appropriation. And so it's a war of all groups against all groups and it's all, it's nothing but a struggle for power and there is no higher order ethic to be referred to because for the postmodernists, um, there is no such thing as a higher order ethic.

Speaker 1:          09:17          There is no such thing as a uniting narrative. That's, that's a hallmark of their thinking. Now, of course, that doesn't work out in practice because without an ethic or a higher order value, there isn't anything you can do with your life because you keep undermining yourself. If everything's just a whim and subjective, there's. And there's no hierarchy of values than what the hell do you do when you get up in the morning, if one thing isn't better than the other, you might as well just lay there and smother yourself with a pillow would be a lot easier than opening your eyes and struggling in the world. So it's so it's completely, it's a self defeating philosophy and I think that's part of the reason why it's more or less self evident that it's a mask for the continuation of Marxism because at least Marxism has as one of its advantages at direction.

Speaker 1:          10:01          It's an ethic, right? Do you have something to struggle against even though what you're struggling against is certainly one of the things that you actually rely on and second something that you have to oversimplify in a very ungrateful and resentful way to justify fighting against it to begin with. And that's especially true in western cultures because as pathological as they certainly are, which is approximately as pathological as all of you are, there are a lot less pathological than almost everything that's ever happened and pretty much everything that's currently happening elsewhere in the world. And you can kind of tell that by the fact that people tend to come to immigrate to the West rather than the reverse. Now, you know, the postmodern new Marxists would have an answer to that, which would be the only reason the west functions is because it's raped the rest of the, of humanity and the planet. But, you know, uh, the less said about that, the better.
