Speaker 1:          00:00          And then in the next scene you see this model home up for destruction. It's quite an interesting scene. Symbolically. See

Speaker 1:          00:09          in the middle of this house here, there's a stain glass window that has a Mandela on it. We'll we'll see it more clearly in a minute. And amended. Mandela is a sacred symbol of the self. That's, that's the union interpretation. It's a symbol. It's very difficult to describe, but it's a symbol. Music is a Mandela except it's played out across time. So you could say that that thing is the same as music, but it's Kinda like a slice of music. It's, it's, it's the same idea. You know, sometimes you see those slow motion or sped up motion videos of a flower unfolding that's the same. It's the same idea. You can imagine that being set to music and somehow that would make sense that Mandela is like a symbol of the unfolding of being and, or the source of meaning or something like that. And it's also a symbol of the self. I'm from the union perspective. And so there you see it more clearly. Kids are starting to burn this place. And, and trash it, and they're dragging the grand piano down the down the stairs, uh, the destruction of high culture about which they're nothing but cynical because they don't believe that hard work and sacrifice can, can produce something of any value and they want to bring it down and destroy it. And that's partly because

Speaker 1:          01:24          can see this in the story of Cain and Abel. Table is hard working and everyone likes him and he makes the proper sacrifices. And so his life goes really well. And that's part of the reason that cain hates him and he's jealous and resentful. But worse than that, if you're around someone, if you're not doing very well, especially if that's your own fault. If you're not doing very well and you're around someone who's doing very well, it's very painful because the mere fact of there being judges you. And so it's very easy to want to destroy that, to destroy that ideal so that you don't have to live with the terrible consequences of seeing it embodied in front of you. And so part of the reason that people want to tear things down is so that they don't have anything to contrast themselves against and to feel bad. And that's exactly what's happening here. The kids are destroying all of this culture, roughly speaking because it judges them the fact that it exists, judges them. And I've often thought this about Michelangelo Statue of David, which is this heroic. So David was a shepherd obviously, and it doesn't sound like much, but back in those times being a shepherd was a big deal because there were lions and you had a slingshot. And so like you got to defend your sheep from lions with a slingshot. So you weren't exactly this, like 19th century English guy dressed in a fairly blue suit. You were tough as a bloody.

Speaker 1:          02:51          Well, it's someone who would go after lion with a slingshot. It's no joke. Anyways, the statue is very heroic and you know, you look at that, you think, well, the possibility of, of human kind. But by the same token, it's also what you're not. And so as well as being an ideal, it's a judge. And every ideal is a judge, so yes.

Speaker 2:          03:13          Yup. So you're, you're using that as an example to illustrate the coming fitter as a result of not being

Speaker 1:          03:23          able to achieve a status as a result, as a result of hard work. But in the example of Canaan, April. Yeah. I'm like one was a shepherd and the other was a farmer. And the one who knows no one is. Yes, that's right. What was the shepherd was the one who was favorite? Yes, that's right. Was that a result of the hard work or was that a result of good question? The stories as well. That's a good question. Those stories are very, very complicated and the story is very ambivalent about whether Kane is not rewarded because he makes bad sacrifices or because God's just in a bad mood and that I like that. If you read the story, I've read multiple translations of the story and when, when caden comes to God, wait, God basically tells him, look, buddy, before you go about criticizing the structure of reality, you should look to your own inadequacies.

Speaker 1:          04:19          He says, Sin Crouches at your door like a predatory sexually aroused animal and you invited it in to have its way with you and something has emerged as a consequence. So p bothered me about my creation before you look to yourself, so there's a very strong hint that the reason that God has not favor cane sacrifices because they weren't particularly good quality, so but the but it is ambivalent in the story and there is the shepherd versus farmer Motif as well and of course that motif runs through the whole entire corpus of stories to some degree, especially the shepherd motif. So it's only about a paragraph long. That whole story and it packs all that into that tiny little amount of space. But the idea that cain kills able to get rid of is ideal and also to punish God. Roughly speaking. It's a brilliant story. I mean these guys who go around shooting up high schools are shooting up high schools in particular, but you know there are definitely out for revenge and what their revenging themselves against or to who is not exactly clear.

Speaker 1:          05:24          Anyways, so these kids are just tearing down this model home carrying down Western civilization. I suppose it's another way of looking at or just tearing down civilization period and Pinocchio's having a pretty good time. He's got his ax and he's looking a little malevolent there and, and happy to be destroying things, which is of course a pretty simple thing to do. So there's that image that I told you about the Mandela that's a flower in this image. And so what happens is that, uh, I think it's lamp wick throws a brick through it. And so what that means is this the self as a symbol of your potential among very many other things, but by engaging in this sort of impulsive, destructive activity, lamp, Wick and Pinocchio, or making it impossible for them to further their development. And they're doing that to some degree consciously, you know, they basically say to hell with it and toss a brick through this highest ideal, the thing through which light shines. So also that hearkens back to the, to the stars. Well, so.
