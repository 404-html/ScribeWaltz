Speaker 1:          00:00          Earlier when you talked about criminality and creativity trends in, uh, in men peaking at 14, it reminded me of something you said, I think it was Joe Rogan. I'm talking with sjws and kind of in how they create their own chaos, talking about how adolescents have this drive to change the world. And I was wondering if, uh, if those three, the criminality, creativity drive to change the world are linked and if so, if they manifest differently in men and women and if they couldn't have come from the same.

Speaker 2:          00:30          I think they are linked. But I'm going to concentrate more on the second part of your question. So I'm going to ask you about something. So I talked to a friend of mine the other day. He's a very, very smart guy and we've been talking about all the sorts of things that we've been talking about tonight for a long time. And we were talking about the relatively the relative evolutionary roles of men and women. This is speculative obviously. And and because our research did indicate it's tended of research so far that, that the, the, the SGS sjw sort of equality above all else philosophy is more prevalent among women, what it's predicted by the personality factors that are more common among women, so agreeableness and high negative emotion, primarily agreeableness. But in addition it's also predicted by being female. And that's interesting because in most of the personality research that I've done and as far as I know in the literature at, you know, in more broadly speaking, most of the time you can get rid of the attitudinal differences between men and women or at least reduce them by controlling for personality.

Speaker 2:          01:35          So if you take a feminine man in a masculine woman, then you know the polls reverse. But that didn't seem to be the case with political correctness. And so I've been thinking about that a lot because, well, men are bailing out of the humanities like mad and pretty much out of the universities except for step, the women are moving in like mad and they're also moving into the political sphere like Matt and this is new, right? We've never had this happen before and we do. No, no. Do not know what the significance of it is. It's only 50 years old and so we were thinking about this and so I don't know what you think about this proposition, but imagine that, that, that historically speaking at something like women were responsible for distribution and men were responsible for production, something like that. And maybe maybe that's only the case really in the tight confines of the immediate family, but that doesn't matter because that's most of the evolutionary landscape for human beings anyways.

Speaker 2:          02:30          But the women does it did was make sure that everybody got enough. Okay. And that seems to me to be one of the things that's driving, at least in part, the sjw demand for, for equity and equality. It's like, let's make sure everybody has enough. It's like, well look, fair enough. You know, I mean, you, you can't, you can't argue with that, but there's, there's an antipathy between that and the reality of differential productivity because people really do differ in their productivity. So. All right, so to answer your question fully, I do think that the rebellious tendency of adolescents is associated both with that criminality spike, especially among men and with creativity. Yes. I think that the sjw phenomena is different and I think it is associated at least in part with the rise of women to political power and and we don't know what women are like when they have political power because they've never had it. I mean there's been queens obviously and that sort of thing. Just being female authority figures and females have wielded far more power historically than feminists generally like to admit, but this is a different thing and we don't know what, what truly female political philosophy would be like, but it might be, especially if it's not been well examined and it isn't very sophisticated conceptually. It could easily be, but let's make sure things are distributed equally well. Yeah, but sorry that that's just not gonna fly.

Speaker 1:          03:52          Do you think in terms of the west with sjws and you talked about last lecture as well, creating chaos when there is none. Otherwise it'd be Sadek. Do you think there would be any validity in saying that in a country like Canada where we're pretty gender equal, is there any merit to thinking sjws are trying to create chaos even when they're arguably is none on a mass level? Obviously there's still problems. Why would they do that? Otherwise it would be static.

Speaker 2:          04:19          Well it wouldn't, but I'm just wondering is this, I read this quote once and I don't remember who, who said it, it might've been Robert Heinlein for crying out loud science fiction author that springs to mind, but it probably, it probably wasn't. And the proposition was that man tested ideas and women tested men and I kind of liked that. There's something about that, you know, and now it obviously it's an overgeneralization, but we also don't know to what degree women test men. Surely through provo provocation it's a lot because like if you want to test someone, you don't have a little conversation with Mike, you poke the hell out of them and you see, okay, like I'm gonna like go after you and see where your weak spots are. And it seems to me that this. It seems to me that in this constant protest and use of shame and all of that, that goes along with this, with this sort of radical movement towards egalitarianism, that there's a tremendous amount of provocation and go on.

Speaker 2:          05:16          I'm going to say this too, even though I shouldn't, but it. But we met her. I don't believe this, but I'm trying trying to figure it out. You know, I thought it was absolutely comical when 50 shades of gray movie that just. I just thought that was just so insanely comical that at the same time there's this massive political demand for like radical equality and and say with regards to sexual behavior and the fastest selling novel the world had ever seen was snm domination. Right? It's like, oh, well we didn't know where the unconscious is going with that one. Don't leave. And sometimes I think like because one of the things that I've really tried to puzzle out and it's like I believe this, right? I'm just telling you what I've, where the edges of my thinking have been going is that you have this crazy alliance between the feminists and the radical Islamists that I just do not get.

Speaker 2:          06:07          It's like the feminist is like why they aren't protesting nonstop about Saudi Arabia is just completely beyond me. Like I do not understand it in the least. And I wonder too, I just wonder bloody wellis this is the fruit in me is like, is there an attraction, you know, the, is there an attraction that's emerging among the female radicals for that totalitarian male dominance that they've chased out of the West? And I mean that's a hell of the thing to think, but I am after all, I am a psychoanalytically minded and I do think things like that because like I just can see no rational reason for it. The only other rational reason is that, well, the West needs to fall and so the enemy of my enemy is, or the is exactly. Now what is it the, I got that wrong. But the enemy of enemy is my friend.

Speaker 2:          06:56          Yes, exactly. Elements tend to vote liberal as well. Yeah, as well so that that could be the case, but I are not going to shake my suspicion about the this unconscious balancing because as the demand for egalitarianism and the eradication of masculinity accelerates, there's going to be a longing in the unconscious for the precise opposite of that. Right. The more you will scream for equality, the more your unconscious is going to admire dominance and so. Well, that's, that's, that's well, that's how you think. If you're a psychoanalytically minded and you know, I'm a great admirer of Freud, he knew a hell of a lot more than people like to think and so, which is partly why everyone still hates them even though it's been 100 years since he's really, really been around. So. All right, we should stop.
