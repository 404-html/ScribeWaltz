Speaker 1:          00:01          The good estimates are that the Russians killed about 30 million of their own people between 19, 19 in 1959, you know, and it's, it's brutal. It's brutal. A lot of that was through starvation. No, I saw a photograph the other day which I tweeted, which is the worst photograph I've ever seen in my life and that's actually saying a lot because I've seen a lot of really terrible photographs because I've done so much investigation into totalitarianism and this was a photograph that was taken during one of the early starvation periods in, in the Soviet Union were about $3 billion peasants died. It was a picture of a peasant couple standing behind a table at a market selling human body parts for food. It's like, and you know, I have this weird quirk, which I don't think does me much good, but maybe helps me understand things better when I see that someone has done something extreme. I learned to do this a long time ago when I worked briefly in a maximum security prison. I tried to imagine what I would have to be like, what kind of situation I would have to find myself and to do that and believe me, man, that's a horrifying enter. That's a horrifying enterprise because it is actually possible. No matter what it is that you read about someone doing and no matter how unlikely it is that you think you would do that, it's possible to imagine yourself in that situation

Speaker 2:          01:31          and that.

Speaker 1:          01:35          Well, that's enlightening. That's what I would say. That's enlightening. You know, because one of the things about enlightenment is is that you get enlightened by doing things that are necessary that you really, really, really do not want to know. You don't want to do. And imagining imagining yourself as a perpetrator of that sort is that tells you something about the world and that tells you something about human beings. But it's a hell of a thing to swallow. You know, and in a very well structured society like ours where were so peaceful. Well, because we have the heat and it always works and we have electricity and it always works. And we have plumbing, which is a bloody miracle, and it always works, you know, it's just one of the things that this imagination process has done for me is keep me alert

Speaker 1:          02:32          to the absolute miracle that my life is every day. It's horribly cold out there. You can't grow any food. You die if you're out there for 24 hours. If any of this infrastructure was unreliable for any length of time, we would be in serious trouble. And it's never unreliable. It's so unlikely. And so here we are with all this reliable infrastructure and because of that, we don't really have to compete with each other much. I mean, some you don't compete for food, you don't compete for shelter or some people do, but not very many. So it's really easy to think of yourself as good because you're not doing anything nasty to anyone. But you know, a cynic might say, well that's just because you don't have any reason to. But those reasons have arisen many times in the past. And in fact they're the norm, not the exception. We're the exception, this insanely functional society that we've somehow managed to generate is it's incomprehensible to me that it exists.
