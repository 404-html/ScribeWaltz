Speaker 1:          00:00          Why don't the feminist complain about Saudi Arabia?

Speaker 2:          00:03          It's like,

Speaker 1:          00:09          you know, Gad Saad, who's this guy at Concordia who is in a business school so he can actually say what he thinks now and then he tweeted yesterday, well he tweeted to the woman's march, you know, because there's little twitter thing you could do that I suppose for the organizers. And he said, why don't you go to the Middle East and have a nice march again, Saudi Arabia and see, see how that works out for ya? Like, so you think, well why not? Like, why not? Why? Why are the why or the radical leftists who are so much for rights everywhere. That's what they say. Why aren't they complaining about Saudi Arabia, for example, which you know, breeds a particularly pathological form of ideologically rigid his lap basically in slaves. They're women. That's to put it properly. It's like, why not complaining about that? Well, how about this? The enemy of my enemy is my friend. And so when push comes to shove, you see how much concern there is among the radical feminists for the rights of women. It's like if, if the pushing those rights forward doesn't also at the same time under a undermine the western patriarchy, then we'll take the undermining and leave the damn rights behind, and so there's an insight for you about exactly what's going on at the bottom of all this.
