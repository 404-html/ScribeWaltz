Speaker 1:          00:01          Is it morally right to bring people into existence without their consent and knowing that they will inevitably intrude suffering during their life? Isn't it selfish? Good question. Tolstoy. I asked that question. So if you're interested in, in an answer that question. No. One of the things I would recommend that you read that book because that was kind of history. We looked at last thought. Yeah. He tells this story. It's a story about this guy. You told her he's being chased by people who want to kill him. So he jumps into this hole and he's hanging on. It's like an old whale. It's hanging on for dear life to this scratching and at the bottom of the hole there's a crocodile and so he's hanging on there. I'm always. How you gone? He noticed this two phase. There's some grapes on the vine and then there's about two mice, one's black and one's white and all of a sudden they're on.

Speaker 1:          01:04          You either started buying into chewing through it so he knows, you know, and Nick Yoder, you could fall and get killed or he could wait last. So what do you guys eat? The grapes, you don't want to. It's a Buddhist store that was story because the white mouse is chaos or order in the black house is chaos and there's always things working at the vitamin B. There's no doubt about it. You know you're screwed no matter what you do, which is the moral of that story and tolstoy. He looked at that story and said, look, the only logical conclusion that you can draw from that is that life is so terrible that it shouldn't exist. And hey, dusty asked the same question in probably is chromosome. You have this therapy. It was just smart. Good wrote being tough guy, good intellect, perceptive and yes, this revenue down the Osha who's kind of.

Speaker 1:          02:00          He's a soft guy in some ways. He's not an intellect, but he's really a good person now. He was just kind of classically religious sneezes. He wants to be vitiated monastery again. And I would just talk to the because he can blow over with his intellect. You know, and I can tell us the story about the Gospel asked you took from the newspaper, this family, mother and father, they were angry at their four year old daughter and her house overnight and she was screaming out there using and not even basically says to know who's making the case for the goodness of being on the goodness of God even says bothered. How can you bothered? It's like this is the sort of thing that happens in the world all the time, and then you ask them what the Osha Law, when you willing voluntary torture that girl to get to ensure that things would continue. Alicia says, well, no, I was doing and what I know you wouldn't do it. So it's like, what's your conclusion about that being shouldn't exist? And then Girtha asks the same question. He is a firehouse is character in that they, that the software works and metastases. This is kind of the intellectual ankle of Satan. That's one way of thinking about it.

Speaker 1:          03:28          And he says the same thing. He's talking about his motivation. He says, well, what motivates the great adversary of mankind? Straightforward being so terrible that it should be eradicated. Okay, fair enough. Strong people try it. It's not clear to me that that's where we should go. So because as far as I can tell, when people work for the eradication of being, it makes everything that they're complaining about way worse, really fast. And so then the other thing you might ask yourself is, do you think that's the motivation? It's really so pure heart. You know they're going to destroy mankind to save and they're making a judgment. The judgment is being is so terrible that it shouldn't exist. Now, don't get me wrong, I get the rationale, the Ivan's rationale. It was never clicked more strongly than in the brothers Karamazov. It's a famous passage and writing.

Speaker 1:          04:24          So the question is with regards to bringing children into the world, mom, it's a variation of the same question. You know the question is what do you have to conclude if you're not willing to do it, you're completely with bed is not with the being is not just a particular. Well that's a hell of a conclusion. I would be very careful before I made it because there are places it takes you that's not good, so and then you might also ask yourself, are you so sure that you're asking that question just because you're a good person or you may be asking that question because you don't want the response to say, of having a child in his finger and said, or maybe you're afraid that you won't know how to fortify the child property, so you're withdrawing the fair. Fair enough. Look what do you do with children because you encouraged them and I mean that literally.

Speaker 1:          05:17          It's like you have a little kid and you say, look, you can take on the world and you don't sugarcoat it just like it's not. It's all fairy tales and roses. It's not. Neil is shield things enough so you don't damage them. It's a very tight balancing because you don't want to know what to overwhelmed. Someone hurt them while you're teaching them. You have to expose him gradually and with intelligence and you do that by having a relationship with the kid. You don't want to shield them from existence. We want to show them just what it's like and then you want to tell them it doesn't matter, man, you're tough enough. You can do it and you can do it right and it's true. They can and if you see four to five and with that knowledge they are, they're being is not characterized by the kind of suffering that makes existence intolerable and so the answer is not to have children.

Speaker 1:          06:09          The answer is cooperative and encourage them and that's tough because you don't. You're kind of fragmented, been broken, and if you treat your child, they might exceed me. That's annoying. So you may do everything you can to bloody well made sure that your kid is broken enough so there's no way they're going to do any better than you, and so I wouldn't recommend that, but people do it all the time, but that doesn't mean that existence itself is insufficient. It just means that you're not handling the property and you're making it far worse than it has to be. In. One of the things I asked myself a long time ago, first of all, I know there's a distinction between tragedy and that's an important distinction. Tragedy is when things happen that aren't good, someone gets cancer. You know your child slips and breaks, his or her labor.

Speaker 1:          07:02          Know your parents guide. That's tragic. Evil is when something tragic happens because someone wanted it. Tap. Okay, so we can distinguish between ell students. The first thing I would say is people can have a tragedy like you can get tough enough so you can have, in fact, I think you can get tough enough so that you even get tougher if you're exposed to trash. That sort of his statement about, you know, whatever doesn't kill me, makes me stronger. Obviously it's an overstatement. It's very hard for people to tolerate evil level ones. So like I've seen people, for example, is adolescent clients with posttraumatic stress disorder. Very often traumatized by malevolence, not tragic. They fall victim to someone who wants to hurt and maybe it's even self that wants to hurt them and that's revealed to them, you know, but sometimes they come into their often naive people to come into contact with someone whose purpose is to hurt them and that shadows so badly to kind of put themselves back together.

Speaker 1:          08:02          Evils really devastated. I think human beings can tolerate tragedy and I also think that if people oriented themselves towards the improvement of being, we could continually ameliorate tragic and I do also believe that being is striving to perfect itself. Now that's obviously a metaphysical statement, but I don't really care if it's a medical metaphysical statement. I have my reasons for for bleeding and I think that the purpose of human life is to participate in that process and because again, the alternative is things are quite lists and life is suffering and it should be eradicated. It's like that leads nowhere. Good really leads nowhere. Good, so I can dispense with it. It's better than where it takes you. It's like a bad roadmap because most profound ideas, our roadmap, they tell you how to get from one point to another. Do you want to get to the depths of infertile chaos or do you want to move towards something that approximates paradise?

Speaker 1:          09:04          Well, he better make sure you have the right map and so and most belief systems, our roadmaps, they're descriptions of reality in our description to objective reality there. That isn't what they are, so have kids to say, it's one third of your life. You will bloody won't regret it if you don't do it. You're not going to be forever or 30. Some days you're going to be 50 or 55 and maybe it will be alone. That's not so good and so you're a fool if you don't have kids. Now, I mean, I know people have their reasons and some people have appropriate reasons and all that, but if it's somebody ideological hangup that stopping you, if you better dispense with that instead, instead of dispensing with the kids.
