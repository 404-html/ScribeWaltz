Speaker 1:          00:00          The routes are pulling on, you can measure rat motivation by how hard they pull on this on the spring, let's say, and they're more motivated if they're running away and running towards. But let's go back to play. So you can take juvenile routes who haven't been able to play for a while, maybe they've been isolated or maybe they just haven't been able to engage in physical activity like many school children that you might be thinking about, um, neither allowed to play nor allowed to engage in physical activity. And there's a reason I'm telling you that. So anyways, you get one of these little rats and you can measure all hardy wants, how hard it, he'll pull the go out and play or how many buttons he'll push, you know, and that gives you an indication of his motivation. So anyways, you can see that the play deprived juvenile rat will fight harder to play than a non play deprived.

Speaker 1:          00:45          You've now rat. And so you can infer that the rat wants to go play. And uh, you know, you do that, you do the same measurement with everyone around you. If they want to do something, you're going to poke and prod out them to see what sort of things they're willing to overcome in order to go and do that. You'll object even if you don't really object. It's like it's a measurement device. And if they're willing to overcome a bunch of your objections, then you think, oh, well maybe they really want to. And that's another thing to really know if there's something you want, you need about five arguments about why you wanted, because the probability that the person who's opposing you will have five arguments about why you shouldn't have it, is very low. They just won't have thought it through enough. So the other thing that happens in the future authoring exercises that you're asked to articulate the reasons for all the goals that come out of your vision of the future.

Speaker 1:          01:37          So you're asked like why would it be good for you? Why would it be good for your family? Why would it be good for broader society? And so that gives you a three levels of argumentation right there, and if you have it articulated down into detail and it's related to other important goals, then you're. You're a hell of a thing to argue with because people just aren't that deep by which I mean they just don't have that many levels of explanation or objection. And it's also really useful in relationship to your own mind. Because if you want to do something that's difficult and that requires energy, a lot of different subsystems in your mind, you're going to throw up objections. It's like, well, maybe that isn't what you should be doing right now. Maybe you should be doing the dishes or vacuuming or watching TV or looking at youtube, or if you're really sneaky when you're trying to do something hard, what your brain does is give you something else hard to do that's not quite as hard so that you can feel justified in not doing the thing you're supposed to because you're doing something else useful.

Speaker 1:          02:31          And if you give into that temptation, which you often will, then it winds and because it winds, it gets a little dopamine kick and it grows stronger. Every. Anything you let when the internal argument grows and anything you let be defeated, shrinks because it's punished. It doesn't get to have its way. So that's another thing really to remember is don't practice what you do not want to become. And because those are their neurological circuits, you build those things in there, man, they're, they're not going anywhere. You can build another machine to inhibit them. That's the best you can do. Once they're in there, you can't get them out. So. And then the ones you build to inhibit can be taken out by stress. And the old habits will come back up. So you gotta be careful what you say and what you do because you, you build yourself that way.
