Speaker 1:          00:01          And human beings, our principal made in the image of that logos and that's why we can speak things into being and we do, and when you speak truth, then you speak paradise into being and when you speak falsely, you speak. Helen's being and that's the truth, and what that means is that with every decision that you make, you decide for yourself and for everyone else, whether you're going to tilt the world a little bit more towards hell or a little bit more towards heaven, and that's the burden you bear for your existence and the choices that you make as you pass through life. And it's the fleeing from that. That's at the bottom of the nihilism of postmodernism and the escaped into the totalitarian certainties of idol worship. And none of this is fictional because we've seen the consequences. Jonathan said quoting, I don't remember the source, that there could be no poetry after Auschwitz, but that's wrong, but the poetry has to be about Auschwitz. The lesson for Marsh, which was never again and fair enough, but

Speaker 2:          01:27          you. You can't

Speaker 1:          01:31          decide not to repeat something terrible unless you understand it, and the way to understand it is that the smallest things of each individual culminate in a great sense of the state, and so when you ask why terrible things happened in the world, the answer is quite simple. The answer is because you're not good enough and it's because you don't tell the truth

Speaker 2:          02:01          and you know it.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Jonathan said something I thought was very interesting. It's something I've thought about, but I haven't talked to him about it at all.

Speaker 1:          02:11          What happens as you move towards the truth and the answer is everything comes together. It really, really is. The answer is everything comes together. There's even a sexual element to that because of course, the highest element of sexual ecstasy is to come together and around someone who's telling the truth. Everything comes together and that's the potential guests. One of the world. It's something that you can partake in. It's the calls. It's the call to the greatest adventure that there is. You can bring forth something akin to paradise by speaking the truth and you can start in your own life and you can start in, in, in the life of your own families, and these are people in principle that you love and so why would you do anything to speak the truth to them, to protect them from reality? There's no protecting from reality. Reality just is you interact with it on your terms. Can you do that? My face get forthright and you do that by not shying away from the challenge. I spent a lot of time trying to understand the sermon on the mount. It's a very strange document. I'm going to tell you what I think it means.

Speaker 1:          03:27          It means conceptualize the highest good that you town and so you might think that would be the highest good for you and it would be the highest good for the family around you that you love and it would be the highest good that sound like in the state and it would be the highest good for the state in the world and that would be the highest possible. Good. Even though even though you don't know how to that, make that what you want and then tell the truth and it's an adventure because you don't know what's going to happen. You have no idea because if you treat things instrumental, if you treat people instrumental, you use them as tools for your own desire and not. The problem with that is what do you know about what you designed? Many things that you chase will turn out to be empty. Well, what happens if you just tell the truth?

Speaker 1:          04:15          Well, the world will unfold around you in very strange and mysterious ways and there isn't anything that's more exciting to now and it's perhaps something excited me enough so that suffering that's attendant on being would redeem itself. Why that adventure, and that's the call, that's the western call to the individual, is suffering of being can redeem itself through truth and it's not. It's, it's not a rule. It's not a proposition that you need to adhere to like a good citizen. It's, it's the proper way of winning your way through the terrible world without making it worse than it already is. But the possibility perhaps of making it better, there's no more exciting possibility to not a no higher moral demand. The thing is is everyone knows that you know when you lie according to your own conception of the truth, that there is some sheet, something shameful and demeaning about that and know that it hurts people and you think, well, why do you do it despite all of that, in part because it's easy and partly the you do it because there's a crooked, horrible, hellish part of your soul that's more than happy if part of what you do is make everything worse.
