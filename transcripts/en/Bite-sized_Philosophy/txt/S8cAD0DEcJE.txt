Speaker 1:          00:00          One of the things you said about the shadow, and this is I would say one of the primary impediments to enlightenment is that if you start looking at your motives for, for misbehaving, and, and I mean by that, something very specific. I mean, I don't mean that you're misbehaving by someone else's standards. I don't mean that. I mean when you know by your own standards that you're doing something that's devious or malevolent or underhanded, you know it and you still do it. So it's your own judgment you're bringing to bear on yourself. If you look at why you're doing that, the longer you look at it, the deeper a hole you dig. And so this is the Motif of Dante's inferno fundamentally. So Dante's inferno is a story about, um, I can't remember his name unfortunately, might be Dante, in fact, although I don't remember.

Speaker 1:          00:52          He's led into hell by Virgil, who's an, who's an ancient, who is an ancient philosopher, thinker and hell has levels. And so the outer level is, and this is a Christianized version of hell because there's hills of all sorts, but this is a christianized virgin version. And so the on the outermost levels of hell, which is sort of like normal life, are the ancient philosophers, so they're still in hell because they weren't Christian, but it's kind of like, it's like cheap motel hell instead of the full pip thing, you know? And so then Dante goes deeper and deeper into hell until he gets right to the bottom of it. It's been a while since I read it, but if I remember correctly, Satan himself is encased in ice at the bottom of hell, surrounded by people who betray others. And so Dante, his notion was that the worst of all possible violations of moral behavior was be trail and that they're in the deepest levels of hell.

Speaker 1:          01:50          And I really liked that idea. I think it's true because if you trust me, then you're manifesting the necessary courage that put someone through life. You know, if you're smart, you don't trust because you're naive. You Trust me knowing that I've full of snakes and so are you. But maybe we could cooperate and move things along nicely. We know and we could reduce each other to the word to our word. And we could cooperate, but you're awake, you know, and then I'd be trey that then I'm undermining your necessary faith in life and humanity and you can really hurt someone that way. Like sometimes it's self be trail, but you can really do someone in that. We can really traumatize them, they can so that they can't recover. And so it's a really terrible thing to do to someone and maybe it's the worst thing and that was don taste idea and it's tied in.

Speaker 1:          02:41          That makes very interesting reading. If you read it at the same time as Milton's paradise lost because those are metaphysical explorations. This is what they are. They're metaphysical explorations of the terrible places you can end up and that people do end up and also a metaphysical explanation of what spirit takes you there. So because you might ask, well why'd you betray someone? And that is a deep question and so you'll have your specific reasons. But under that there'll be some other reasons. And under that there'll be some other reasons. And under that there'll be some other reasons. And if you go all the way to the bottom, you come up with the ultimate reasons why you'd be trade someone and when you look at that, that will not be pretty. That's when your proclivity for evil, let's say you nights with the general human proclivity for evil and you discover just exactly what you're capable of.

Speaker 1:          03:32          And so humans notion was that, well that was a full encounter with the shadow, which is I suppose partly what this course is about because one of the things that I believe I told you at the beginning was that I was going to try to help you understand how it might be that you could be an Auschwitz guard and to really understand that that's a horrifying thing to understand. But I'll tell you, if you want to grow some teeth, that's a really good thing to understand. So we were talking about your capacity to negotiate before, like if you aren't a monster, you cannot negotiate. But if you, if you've got that under control, then you don't have to be a monster. It's really paradoxical. So if you're just naive, well you end up in jail. And marionette master has control over you. That's not helpful.

Speaker 1:          04:25          So that's not good. That just means you're useless and you can be manipulated, won't go out of your way to be malevolent. But it's mostly because you just don't have the skills or the organizational skills or, or even the depth to do that. You know you're good because you're harmless. That's not good. That's easily manipulated. And so you think, well how do you get out of that? Well, partly you watch people that because you know what they're like because you know what you're like and that, but you also know what you could do and would do if you were pushed. And so you don't have to show much of that when you're negotiating with someone for them to take you really seriously. So it's a strange thing, you know, but one of the things you pointed out too was that what you most need to know will be found where you least want to look. And that's because you haven't already looked there. And so it's a little different for every everyone, right? Because your particular place you'd want to look isn't going to be the same as your place, but you're going to have a place you don't want to look and what you haven't discovered. That's where it is, and so that's partly going to be discovered by you looking at what you're capable of, what you're truly capable of.
