Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey Dr Peterson, I'm curious about the connection between aesthetic beauty and religious experience. I think you've hinted at it once or twice over the course of the lecture. Um, is it possible, um, for something that's incredibly beautiful to evoke or religion, religious or mystical experience or something of in the same ballpark is that's what they're for? Yeah. No, I mean if you look at the structure of like a, like a renaissance cathedral was just going to check my, uh, my tag onto. I apologize you mentioned trump. My tag onto that question. The next part was um, um, is that why we have cathedral is built like a spectacular buildings as opposed to make socks or something? Right? Well, it's, if you're going to how's the ultimate ideal, you build something beautiful right to, to represent it's dwelling place and it should be beautiful and this is something that people do not take seriously.

Speaker 1:          00:55          And this is especially something we don't take seriously in Canada. I mean, one of the you think about, you think about all the hundreds of millions of dollars that were invested into beauty in Europe, mean spectacular, excessive investment in beauty that's paid back. God only knows how many multiples of times people make pilgrimages to Europe constantly because it's so beautiful that it just staggers you. Beauty is so valuable and we're so afraid of it and I think we're afraid of it because it does. It's a pathway. It's not the only pathway to the divine. I mean there's lot. There's pathways to the divine. Love is one of them I suppose, but beauty especially for people who have an affinity for, but it's. It's like music. It's one of those things that you can't argue against, right? You can't even understand. It just hits you and it does.

Speaker 1:          01:46          It shows you. Well, it shows you the ideal. That's one way of thinking about it, but it also shows you. I think it's like a vision of the potential future. It's something like that as well that if we just got our act together and beautified things that that's the place that we can inhabit and not winning noble us and that's why this Jerusalem, the heavily city is paved with gemstones, you know, their crystalline, the admit light and yeah, it's the proper dwelling place for an enlightened consciousness. Ut is the proper dwelling place for an enlightened consciousness and we, we ignore it at our inner spiritual and economic peril. It's our, like, it's obvious that, but there's almost nothing more valuable than but economically, practically. So yeah. Why that is. I mean, I don't. It's very. Who knows. I mean why we, we experienced gemstones for example, is beautiful. It's very mysterious, but they're deep reasons for it. So. Yep.
