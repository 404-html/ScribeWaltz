Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00          that's Martin, so the story of Martin, I'll just give it to you very briefly.

Speaker 2:          00:08          Timeout and aps who are locked in, embrace it at the beginning of time. God is of salt water, garden, fresh water together, chaos in order, right? They give rise, masculine, feminine. They give rise to the world of the elder gods and those are to me, they're primordial motivational forces or something like that and their rage and their lost and their love and all these things that possess us that are there forever and they're out in the world acting and they carelessly slay appsu their father and their making a rocket and then they collapsed and then tie them out, gets wind of that and that's time out right there. By the way, she's kind of a rough looking creature and she's the mother of all things and so she's not very happy about this. These are her children have destroyed structure itself, plus they're noisy and careless and so she thinks all right, just like, no.

Speaker 2:          01:00          I'm just like the God that brings the flood to know what exactly the same idea time matt comes back and says, yeah, okay, enough is enough. I'm going to take you out, and she makes this battalion of monsters and puts the worst monster there is that the head of the battalion, his name is king who he's like a precursor to the idea of Satan and she lets the gods know, hey, I'm coming for you, and so they're not very happy about this because their gods. But like, yeah, she's chaos itself, right? She gave birth to everything. This is no joke, and so they send one got out after another to confront her and they all come back with their tails between their legs. There is no hope and then one day there's a new guard that emerges and that's. And the guards know. As soon as he pops up, they know he's something new.

Speaker 2:          01:45          Remember, this is happening while the Mesopotamians are assembling themselves into one of the world's first great civilizations. So all the gods of all those tribes are coming together to organize themselves into a hierarchy to figure out what proposition rules everything. And so Marta is elected by all the gods and he says, look, I'll go out there and I'll take on time map, but here's the rule from on, you follow me. I determine destiny. I'm the top God. I'm the thing at the top of the hierarchy. And all the other gods say, hey look, no problem. You get rid of chaos. We do exactly what you say. Now Marta, his eyes all the way around his head and he speaks magic words. Those are his primary attributes. And so he takes a net and he goes out to confront timeout. And, and he, he, he, he encloses her in the net, which I think is so cool because it's an encapsulation, right? It's a conceptual encapsulation. He encloses chaos itself in a conceptual structure. He puts it in the net and then he cuts her into pieces and he makes the world. And then that he creates human beings to inhabit that world and to serve the gods. And he creates human beings out of the blood of King of the worst, the demons. And that took me to call Andy Young, who was a student of mine, helped me figure that out. I thought that's pretty damn pessimistic. It's like, you know what exactly? It sounds like a full metaphor. It's like the idea of original sin, but, but our joint conclusion

Speaker 2:          03:16          with regards to that was that human beings are the only creatures in creation that can truly deceive, right? We have the capacity for evil, just like it says in the Adam and Eve story. We can actually do that. And that's why we're made out of the blood of King, knew the king of the demons. The we are the thing that can deceive, that can twist the structure of reality. Well. So Marduk now the, the team has had an emperor and the emperor was the

Speaker 2:          03:44          Avatar of Marta. That's what made them emperor. He was only at Emperor. If he was going to be Murdoch, he had to be a good Marduk. Which man he, I do confront time, chaos and cut her up and make order out of her pieces. And what the Mesopotamians used to do after New Year's celebration, they'd go outside their walled city and that's explored territory versus unexplored territory. They go outside their world's city into chaos, and they bring all the statutes that represented the gods and they'd act this out because they were trying to figure something out, right? You're trying to figure out what this means. They're acting it out, and then they'd take their emperor and the priest would make them kneel and they take all his king. He is king. Uniform off is emperor uniform off and make them Neil and humiliate them and nail them with a glove and say, okay, how were you not a good Martech this year?

Speaker 2:          04:30          Right? And then he'd recount all the ways that he was inadequate in confronting chaos. And then they'd do the celebration and Martech would win and the king would go sleep with a royal prostitute. And the reason for that was it's the same idea as St George pulling the Virgin from the Dragon. It's exactly the same idea that if you call, if you encounter the reptilian chaos, you can extract something out of it with which if you unite, you produce creative order. That's what they were acting out and that was the basis for the Mesopotamian idea of sovereignty. It's so smart. It's so unbelievably smart and know the Mesopotamians had a massive influence on the civilizations that then had a massive influence on us. It's one of the stories of how the notion of sovereignty itself came to be. It's the evolution of the idea of God. That's one way of thinking about it, but even more importantly, it's the evolution of the idea of the redemptive human being. Right, and that's taken to. It's one of its conclusions while in the story of Buddha, but also in the story of Christ, the idea of the perfect individual and the notion is, well, that's the word that speaks truth into chaos at the beginning of time to generate habitable order. That is good. That's the story, and so with that,

Speaker 1:          05:47          let's see.

Speaker 2:          05:49          Oh sure. I'll just show you these pictures because they're so interesting once you know what they mean. They're so cool. That's a symbol of infinity. That's Hercules and the hydro. Well, what slice? Like cut off one head. What happens? Seven more. Grow, right? Well, what do you do? Run home. Well, no, that's not what you do it. This is what you do. You fight it.
