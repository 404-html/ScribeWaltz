Speaker 1:          00:00          You're in a class, it's near the beginning of the semester. You write an exam or you handed in an essay and you don't get the mark that you desired. Okay, so what are your options? One option would be, so you've hit an anomaly. Things didn't happen the way you wanted them to happen and so maybe you say, Geez, that was a boring and stupid class. Anyways, this gives me an excuse to get out and so that's not such a negative thing or you think, oh well I really better buckle down and study and you just started to stay in the class. So basically what you've done is maintained your framework. I'm going to work through this class, but you're, you're, you've decided to modify some of the sub routines that make up that frame. You say, well I should study more next time or I have to prioritize this class compared to other classes. So it's a micro alteration within the overarching framework. But another thing you can do is say to hell with the class. I just won't. I'll just drop it.

Speaker 1:          00:54          And so the advantage to that is problem gone. The disadvantages, well now you have a different problem which is, okay, fine, you drop the class, do you have another class that you can replace it with? Is that a good way of dealing with micro failure, you know, to move up a level of analysis and throw throughout the whole frame because you could also say, well maybe I should just drop out of university and maybe I should go hang myself. You know, that's. Well, it's the same line of logic. It's just taken up to a higher degree of abstraction and so generally speaking you don't want to solve a problem by moving up a level in wiping out the frame within which the problem was experienced. Do you want to do that carefully? Because in principle, the frame that you were working within had already. You'd already assigned value to it and worked at it. You've already invested in it. It's a big sacrifice to blow out the whole frame. Now sometimes you can do it. So anyways, what happens is, well, you get the bad grade and you're upset about it, and so you've been plunged from your happy, satiated state. Let's say into a state of relative chaos and the chaos is, oh, I hit an obstacle, I didn't expect it and now I don't know what to do, and so what does it mean to not know what to do? Well,

Speaker 1:          02:12          it can mean I need to study harder. It can mean I should drop this course. It can mean I should major in a different subject. I mean maybe I shouldn't be in university. It could mean maybe my future plans have been formulated badly. It can mean my future plans had been formulated badly because I don't understand myself very well and I've been telling lies about my past. Right? The thing can really expand on you and that's what the chaotic domain is. That's the real manifestation of those things that you had considered irrelevant, right? Because when you go to pick up the exam, you've got your identity as a competent student intact. You're not questioning whether you should be in the course or whether you should be in that major or whether you should be in university. None of that. That's all in the implicitly accepted category and as soon as the anomalous event emerges, all of those things that you had rendered axiomatic start to become questionable and that's like the shark coming up out, coming up from the depths to pull you down and that's the classic way of representing that and symbolizing it.

Speaker 1:          03:16          That's Jonah and the whale for example, so it's something is manifested itself from the deep unknown and pulls you under like an alligator at a, at a waterhole, which is I'm sure one of the sources from which we derived that particular kind of mythological representation because you could imagine that when we were on the velt after living on trees, we had to go down to the dam water holes and you've. You've watched enough nature programs to know what a denial crocodile can do to a water buffalo. It's not pretty. And so to go down to the water, the chaotic water and the source of all life as well, right, is to risk an encounter with the terrible thing that lurks in the depths. And so we use that as a central metaphor for, for, for mapping the sorts of things that happened, happened to us in a much more abstract space. And you know that because one of the things you're going to do, let's say that the, the, the professor, there's a professor obviously who gave you the bad grade, okay? So one logical presupposition is that you're in some sense insufficient in relationship to the course. But another logical and instantaneous categorization is to throw that person into the category of malevolent Predator. And you'll do that by becoming upset and cursing the person in your imagination.
