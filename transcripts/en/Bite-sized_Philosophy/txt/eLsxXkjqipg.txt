Speaker 1:          00:00          It's, it's unbelievable the degree to which our sanity depends on our functioning, sociological structure and, and here's why. Well, first of all, you kind of need to know what to do every day. You have to have a routine because you're an animal, you know, and you know if you have a dog or a cat, dogs are really good example of this. Dogs like routine, they like to be walked the number of times a day that they're supposed to be walked and they get quite sick very rapidly. If you don't, if you don't routinize their days, children are exactly the same way. Now you can overdo it, right? But still, you know, you need to know approximately when you should get up, should be approximately the same everyday. You need to know approximately. You're going, when you're going to eat, you need to know what you're going to eat.

Speaker 1:          00:43          You need to know who you're going to eat with. You need to know where to buy your food. It's like 80 percent of your life, 70 percent of your life. Something like that consists of those things that you do every single day that you repeat, and those are often the things that people think about as the trivial elements of their life, but one of the things I would like to point out to you if you do the mathematics I, I did this with a client of mine who was having a hard time putting his child to bet they were having a fight every night and I knew by that time the studies indicate that most parents only spend 20 minutes per day of one on one time with their child. Now the reason for that is that people are busy and it's actually not that easy to parse out 20 minutes of one on one time.

Speaker 1:          01:27          It's a lot bloody more time than you think, but that's all there is. Twenty minutes and he's spending like 40 minutes a day fighting with his kid, trying to get the kid to go to bed and that's not very entertaining. You know, you think, well, it's just having a scrap with a kid about going to bed, but it's. No, no, no, no, no. If it happens every day, it's a catastrophe, so you do the math, so we'll say five hours a week for the sake of argument, just to keep it simple. It's 20 hours a month, it's 240 hours a year. That's 60 slash 40 hour work weeks, so that guy was basically spending a month and a half of work weeks doing absolutely nothing but having a wretched time fighting with his son, trying to get them to go to bed. Horrible, right? That's just way too much time to spend doing something like that.

Speaker 1:          02:15          If you want to actually have a positive relationship with someone because it's just too. It's just too punishing and so well, so you need structure, you need predictability and you need more of it than you think just to keep you sane. Now, if you're lucky and and maybe a bit odd, you can deviate five percent from the norm or 10 percent from the norm or something like that carefully and cautiously. As long as the rest of you is all well ordered, an informative manner, you might be able to get away with that and you might be able to sustain that across time and people might be able to tolerate you if you do it or maybe you'll get really lucky and you happen to be creative but reasonably well put together and people will actually be happy that there's something idiosyncratic and unique about you.

Speaker 1:          02:59          But even under those circumstances, mostly what you want is to have a routine. It's disciplined, that's predictable and bloody well stick to it. You're going to be way healthier and happier and Saner if you do that. And then the other thing that you need, because this is one of the things the psychoanalyst got wrong, I think is that they overestimated the degree to which sanity was a consequence of internal, of being properly structured internally. You know, because from the psychoanalytic point of view, you're sort of an ego and that ego is inside you and of course it rests on an unconscious structure. But the purpose of psychoanalytic analysis is to sort out that unconscious structure and the ego on top of it and to make you a fully functioning and autonomous individual, but there's a problem with that because the reason that you're saying as a fully functional and antonymous human being isn't because you've organized your psyche, even though that's important.

Speaker 1:          03:56          The reason that you're saying, if you're aware, if you have a well organized unconscious and ego is because other people can tolerate having you around for reasonably extensive periods of time and we'll cuff you across the back of the head every time you do something so stupid that people will dislike you permanently if you continue, and so what people are doing to each other all the time, just nonstop is broadcasting. Sanity signals back and forth, right? It's like you smile at people. If they're well, if they're not only behaving property but behaving in a way that you would like to see them continue to behave, you frown at them. If they're not, you ignore them. If they're not, you shun them. You, you roll your eyes out them. You manifested disgust face. You don't listen to them, you interrupt them, you won't cooperate with them, you won't compete with them.

Speaker 1:          04:42          It's like you're blasting signals of other people about how to regulate their behavior so frequently. Well, it just makes up all of your social interaction and that's why we face each other and we have emotional displays on her face and we're looking at each other's eyes and we know exactly we know as much as we can about what's going on with each other given that we don't have immediate access to the contents of their consciousness. And so partly what you're doing with your routine is establishing yourself as a credible, reliable, trustworthy, potentially interesting human being who isn't going to do anything too erratic at any moment and everyone else is around there tapping you into shape, making sure that that's exactly what you are and that's how you stay sane. And so what happens to people too, if they don't have a routine and they get isolated as they start to drift and they drift badly because the world is too complicated for you to keep it organized all by yourself. You just cannot do it. So a lot of our, so we outsource the problem of sanity and it's very intelligent that we outsourced the problem of sanity because sanity is an impossibly complex problem. And so the way that we manage the incredibly complex problem is we have a very large number of brains working simultaneously on the problem all the time.
