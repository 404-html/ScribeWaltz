Speaker 1:          00:01          Traditional Chinese doctors go into people's houses to diagnose why it is that someone in that house of suffering and they walk in and they think there's too much order here. I've been in houses like that. That's a house where all the furniture is covered with plastic. That's a house where if you put a glass on a wooden table, that mistress of the house runs over with the coaster, slips it under immediately and gives you a dirty look. That's a place where the children never play in the living room. That's a place where the lines in the carpet or vacuum so precisely that they're actually parallel. That's a place where there's so much order that no one can survive because the person who runs the house as a tyrant and then anyone who's sick in that house is sick because they're suffering from an excess of order and then you can walk into a house that's completely different and you can even see this in your own room if you want. Everything's in complete disarray. You can't even look at that place. You're sick the moment you cross the threshold because everywhere you look, there's parts of an transforms, chaos yelling to you, do something about this loser.
