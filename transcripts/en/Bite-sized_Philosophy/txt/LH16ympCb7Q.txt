Speaker 1:          00:00          There's three things that divide women and men most, particularly from the psychometric perspective. One is that women are more agreeable than men, and so that seems to be the primary maternal dimension as far as I can tell, it's associated with a desire to avoid conflict, but it's associated with interpersonal closeness, compassion, politeness. Women are reliably higher than men, especially in the Scandinavian countries and in the countries where egalitarianism has progressed the farthest, so that's where the difference is. Maximize, which is one of the things James Demore pointed out quite correctly in his infamous google memo. Okay. Women are higher in negative emotion, so that's anxiety and emotional pain that that difference is approximately the same size and again that maximizes in egalitarian societies which is extremely interesting and then the biggest difference is the difference in interest between people and things and so women are more interested in people and men are more interested in things which goes along quite nicely with your car anecdote, but the thing about men interacting with Matt and again is that it isn't that they respect each other's viewpoints.

Speaker 1:          01:03          That's not exactly right. What happens with a man, and I know a lot of men that I would regard as as remarkably tough people for one reason or another and everything you do with them is a form of combat. Like if you want your viewpoint taken seriously, often you have to yell them down and like they're not going to stop talking unless you start talking over them. You know, and it's, it's not like manner automatically giving respect to other men because that just doesn't happen. Instead, the combat is there and it's expected and one of the problems. And so this is part of the reason why I think men are being taken out of so much of academia and, and, and maybe the academic world in general and maybe the world in general, is that man actually don't have any idea how to compete with women.

Speaker 1:          01:46          Because the problem is, is that if you unleash yourself completely, then you're an absolute bully. And there's no doubt about that. Because if men unleashed themselves on other men, that can be pretty goddamn brutal. Especially for the men that are really tough and this. So that just doesn't happen with women, but so you can unleash yourself completely if you, when you're a bully, if you lose while you're just bloody pathetic. So how the hell are you supposed to play a game like that, you know? So in I've worked with lots of women in law firms and in Canada for example, and high achieving women, like really remarkable people I would say. And they're often nonplussed I would say by the attitude of the man in the law firm because they would like to see everyone pulling together because they're all part of the same team, whereas the manner like at each other's throats in an, in a cooperative way because they want the law firm to succeed, but they want to be the person who's at the top of the success hierarchy. Right? So, and that, that doesn't jive well with the more competitive or cooperative ethos. That's part and parcel of agreeableness. And so we don't really have any idea how to integrate male and female dominance. And that's exactly right. This is why I this show,

Speaker 2:          03:00          real housewives and went to, which is more sentence scorns and just say just last night, okay. I was watching an episode right where the women were at each other. Okay. At a party and in, in, in recounting, but I said this to you, but you said this to me and you and the men got. We got together there and said, well, this is the way they communicate with each other and insight in the men we men, okay. Just we'll have a fistfight and wheel him in 10 minutes later we're going to have a beer at the bar next to each other and so and I have observed that my mind fire daughter,

Speaker 1:          03:30          my daughter used to be really irritated about that because she, she, like most people was the target of feminine. Conspiratorial bullying when she's no pushover, my daughter. So this wasn't like this was a continual thing or that she didn't know what to do about it, but she used to observe these girls conspiring against her and then black getting your name on on facebook, which is part of it, part and parcel of the typical female bullying routine, which is often reputation demolition, right? That there's a good literature on that. And then she'd watched what would happen if my brother or my son would have a dispute with his friends, you know, and maybe they were drinking and there was a dispute, they'd have a fight and then the next day they were friends again. And that's another thing that's strange is that men have a way of bringing a conflict to a head and resolving it right. And that it isn't the obvious to me that women have that same. Perhaps you might call it a luxury, but it's also the case that men don't know what to do when they get into a conflict with a woman. Because what the hell are you supposed to do? You know? Mostly what you're supposed to do is avoid it.
