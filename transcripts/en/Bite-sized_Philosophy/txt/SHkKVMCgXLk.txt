Speaker 1:          00:00          And this is what behavior therapists do. They decompose your problems. What are you afraid of? Well, okay, you're afraid of everything. Well, let's get something specific you're afraid of. Well, I'm afraid of an elevator. Okay. An elevator. So I have a client, she's afraid of elevators. The elevator door open. She goes, that's a tube. And I thought, oh wow. I thought it was an elevator. But for you it's not a bloody elevator. It's death. And so that's what you're afraid of. It's worse than that. You're afraid of being trapped inside there in the dark alone, alone, not knowing if anyone is going to rescue you, stuck there with your damn imagination freaking out. It's like. And if that's not, and then maybe you have a heart attack because you're so terrified and you die. It's like, you know, so that's the elevator. Well, it's no bloody wonder. No one's going to get into something like that. And then maybe underneath that is your distrust in the mechanisms of society, right? Because you know a normal person that was weird creatures, they'll get an elevator. What the hell? They don't care. And partly it's because they have an implicit belief, even if the thing stops, somebody will come along and rescue them and usually you don't even think about it, right? It's like, wow, what the hell? It's an elevator. So like

Speaker 1:          01:13          the danger is invisible to you

Speaker 1:          01:16          and it's partly because you implicitly trust the structure and so maybe you go into the unconscious presuppositions of the person who is terrified of the elevator in the subways and you find out they have a real problem with trusting authority. That's partly why they don't get along with her husband and why they'd never been able to stand up for themselves. So then you say, okay, while you're afraid of the damn elevator, but it's not an elevator, it's a tomb. And the tomb is partly you. And partly it's partly the elevator and partly your unconscious mind. And so well, what can you handle? Can you go and look at an elevator from 10 feet away? It's like, yes. Okay. How about nine feet away? Yes. Five feet. Four feet? No. Okay. No problem. Four and a half feet. We're going to go from that elevator and we're going to look at the damn thing until you're bored of it because that's what we're trying to.

Speaker 1:          02:03          You should be board of the elevator because then you're not afraid of it. Obviously. It's like an elevator. You just don't notice it. Right? All of these things around here that you don't notice. I'd take you out of here and ask you what color the walls are. You haven't got any idea. You know, I, I suspect for most of you, there's not a chance you'd be able to identify the gender of the person who's sitting next to you unless you know them. It's like you just don't remember anything and why should you? Everything works like you don't have to pay attention to it. It's like,

Speaker 1:          02:35          does that stay up? Yeah, it's still up. Yeah. Still up. Still up. It was like, really? No, you know, you get bored of that real quick and so then you just ignore it and. But the agoraphobic has had that veil of ignorance torn away and what they see behind it is mortal threat. And so that's really what you're helping them deal with. And so this week there are four and a half from the elevator. Next week they're a foot from the elevator and the week after that the horrible gates of hell opened and they look inside and they don't run. And so, hey, they're tougher than they thought they were. And that's what you're teaching them. Actually you're not teaching them that the world isn't dangerous because that's a stupid thing to teach someone bloody right? The world is dangerous. It's terrifying. And sometimes people under a realize that and the veil lifts and they see horror everywhere.

Speaker 1:          03:25          They see that and then they think, well, I'm just a little rabbit. I'm over here in the corner. I can't move. I'm petrified. And then they can't move. They hide it home. The cower at home because everything is become a predatory domain. And so what you teach them is you're not as much of a rabbit as you think. And part of that is that you help them grow. Some teeth so that they can go home and have that fight with their husband that they should have had 25 years ago and it happens very frequently with agoraphobic clients that you get them so they can go on the damn elevator and they can go on the subway, they can take a taxi. It maybe they learn to drive. Wow. That gets some autonomy and then they're a little tougher and so then they can stand up for themselves and they go back and like their husband might not be very happy with any of this really.

Speaker 1:          04:13          It depends on what sort of guy he is. You know, if he's a real tyrant, he might be just perfectly happy that he's married to someone who was afraid of her own shadow because then she won't ever leave. And so that's a nasty little story and believe me, it's not uncommon. So she gets tougher by facing what she fears and what she finds out is there's a hell of a lot more to her than she thought. And that's really what happens when you do behavior therapy with someone who's agoraphobic. It isn't really that they get less afraid, it's that they get braver. That's way different. It's because brave is alert and able to cope. Naive is there's no danger. It's like hell, you have right? There's no danger. Jesus. What a stupid theory that is.
