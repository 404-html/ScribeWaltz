Speaker 1:          00:00          What's the alternative given that they have a point, while as far as I can tell, the alternative is a proper return to the past and that is precisely to journey into the chaos, to look at the worst possible thing and to pull the dead father up from the chaotic depths. That's how you stop being a puppet. Someone whose strings are being pulled by forces they do not understand behind the scenes,

Speaker 1:          00:28          you find out what's great about your culture, this thing that's provided us with everything that we see in this room, this amazing warmth that we're experiencing when it's 30 bloody below, outside the fact that the electricity of the heart and the computational resources are working and that we can all sit here peacefully and then no one is hungry fat. We're too fat. That's our big problem. Oh No, we have so much stuff. We're getting fat. Yeah, well that's a good problem to have. We should have some gratitude for what's being produced that's brought us to this point and we need to wake up and understand what we're doing. Well, that's what. That's what people like. That's what the psychoanalysts were trying to do in the 20th century. That's what all the great clinicians we're trying to do and I would say above all else that was what Carl young was trying to do.

Speaker 1:          01:14          He believed firmly that the idea of the divine spark within the individual was a, was a metaphysical reality by which he meant a reality that actually transcended and existed superordinate to the physical reality of more real reality. That's whatever consciousness is something we understand from a scientific perspective, not at all that's been represented in our mythologies as far back as we can push them as an independent agent in the world, giving rise to form. That's how we treat each other. That's how we recognize ourselves. That's how we judge each other. You make your bed and then you lie in it and everyone knows it and that's not to say that you're not subject to random and chaotic circumstances and the tragedy of life. Just because you can do some things doesn't mean you can do everything, but you can do some things and if you don't do them, then things fall apart and the problem with things falling apart is that you will be happy about it to the degree that you're not trying to repair them because to the degree that you do not manifest what's within you, then your life falls apart around you and everything that could make you bitter multiplies until you're in a situation where you want the destruction you want to bring it on, and it's not surprising.

Speaker 1:          02:36          [inaudible] life can be so terrible that the question of whether or not it should exist at all can be a real question, but the answer to that is his life so terrible that it shouldn't exist. Well, the answer is it depends on how you live it and if your life is so terrible that you can't bear it, then it raises the question of whether or not you're living at properly. And that's not to say that people don't suffer under burdens that are too great for them to bear. They certainly do. It doesn't matter because if you let that embitter you, if you let that destroy your allegiance to the proper path, all it does is make that worse and everything else. It's no out.
