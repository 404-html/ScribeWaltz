Speaker 1:          00:00          Psychopaths, I don't,

Speaker 1:          00:04          I say this, I hope non naively also having dealt with psychopaths in my clinical practice and I would say now and then in my life, I don't believe in psychopaths. I don't believe that we know enough to say there are people born without conscience. Um, I don't think the psychometric measurement of psychopathy is everything that it should be. I've been trying to model it bay in the big five domain. I think now it's complicated because, so I would say a psychopath, the classic psychopath is likely extroverted, especially assertive, disagreeable and unconscientious and maybe extremely low in neuroticism. So you can't frighten them. But so that's a rare combination because it's extreme on many traits, right? But that, I don't believe that that means that someone with that personality configuration is doomed from birth to a pathological existence because there's things about psychopathy that, that the, that the classifiers, those who claim like collectively that the psychopath is born in some sense can't explain. It's like, well, what about the cruelty? It seems to be a motive there. You know, with our passionless and they lack, they lack emotion. Well, why are they cruel then for entertainment? Well, but then you have to explain the entertainment motivation, like there's a failure in some sense with the classic psychopathy theorists to come to grips with the problem of malevolence. It's skirted over and you can't do that. If you're talking about psychopathy, it's like malevolence is the bloody issue here. And so

Speaker 1:          01:44          the other issue with this psychopath is that he's irredeemable, right? That's the idea.

Speaker 1:          01:50          I don't think we know enough to make such claims now and that doesn't. I know the psychopathy literature quite well and I have great respect for their primary researchers in the field. I want to make that perfectly clear, but we're talking at a different. We're talking, we're approaching the problem from a different level of analysis here. Something like a spiritual level of analysis and I don't think that there's an easy, easy translation from the descriptive psychometric psychiatric approach to the spiritual level. They don't match and I'm more likely to say let's not assume the soul is doomed from birth. Right? And I'm, I'm loath to think that there are people born irredeemable. Although I do think there are irredeemable people knew that the death penalty issues interesting in that regard, you know, because I've read a lot about really terrible people and I've also read a lot about what really terrible people said about themselves and many of them wished for the death penalty and so it's absolutely clear that there are things that you can do that deserved the death penalty, but that doesn't mean that the state should have the right to impose it.

Speaker 1:          02:58          That's a different question, so yeah,

Speaker 2:          03:04          thank you.
