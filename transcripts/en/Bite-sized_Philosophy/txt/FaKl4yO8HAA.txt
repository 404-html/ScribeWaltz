Speaker 1:          00:00          Consider the overwhelming success as a Patreon account the money raised by rebel. What will you be doing with the contributions? Well, that's great. Alright, so I've got a couple of things to say about that. So the first one is, you know, I would say a number of people have been attempt and not an overwhelming number, but a number of people have been attempting to take me to task for the fact that my Patreon support has been, let's call it overwhelmingly successful. And so I'll tell you how I formulate my response to that. The first is I'm generating almost all of my content and making it completely publicly accessible so it's free, right? And, and so that way I'm bringing, I think awareness of psychological issues to a very large number of people. And so far at the moment my view count on Youtube is up to $30 million and I did a little bit of calculations last week to try to figure out what the total view count was, um, for, for the cuts of my lectures that have been appearing on Youtube.

Speaker 1:          01:02          And then the political material as well. And I think it's upward of $50 million and so I'm making psychological and political content available to $50 million people. And so, you know, that seems like a reasonable thing to do now. People who don't agree with what I'm saying might differ, but I think that could be separated from the educational content as well. So, and then with regards to the Patriot on subscribers, every single person who's doing that is doing it entirely voluntarily. And I also set up that Patriot on account long before any of this political material emerged. So. And my sense with the patron viewers, and you guys can clue me in if I'm wrong about this, is that there's two things happening. One is it enables people who are not very happy about the current political situation in the west to to, to contribute to something that might be at least to some degree attempting to stem the tide of such things as toxic political correctness and second, that it enables people to support my endeavors, to bring general education to a wider audience. And that seems like a good deal for everyone. And, you know, you might say, well, it's a particularly good deal for me and I'm certainly not complaining about what's happening, but I would also point out that it hasn't exactly been a straightforward thing. And so, um,

Speaker 1:          02:27          so I guess if anyone else wants to try it, they're more than welcome to. Now having said that, um, I would also say that the real issue here, and I think this is the fact that this isn't self evident, is also a commentary on the toxicity of our culture at the moment, is that it actually isn't the issue. The issue isn't really how much money you have.

Speaker 1:          02:49          I think that that's a resentful and at relatively vicious way of judging someone else. I think the issue is what you do with the money when you have it. And you know, I'm, I'm not a particularly hedonistic person and I'm not 25 years old, you know, I'm 55 years old and I'm going to be a grandfather and a couple of months, you know, thank God for that. Um, and what I want to do with that money is to do the best things I can possibly think of to do with it. And one of the things I'm thinking about, I started this biblical series and a lot of that's helped thankful thanks to you guys on Patrion because that enabled me to generate the capital that was necessary to rent the theater because for 12 lectures that was a $60,000 investment about that, something like that.

Speaker 1:          03:32          And then another $8,000 for the, for the camera work. And that had to be basically dealt with upfront. So it was a reasonable financial risks. Now I've been crazily fortunate in that theater tickets have also sold out, so it looks like the biblical series will pay for itself with some extra leftover. And so, you know, I'm pretty happy about that because that gives me some more working capital. And then you might say, well what am I going to do with the capital? Well, I'm going to continue doing the sorts of things that I'm already doing. I want to do a series on the hundred greatest books of the western Canon. For example. I want to move genuine humanities education out of the universities where it isn't being taught anyways as far as I can tell online where people can access it freely. I'm talking to a wide variety of people right now about trying to do that in a more formal sense so that the possibility for widespread university education can be universally accessible and one of the things we're trying to crack is the problem of how to teach people to write.

Speaker 1:          04:32          Because that's a real troublesome thing. And by the way, you know you guys, if you go onto my website, Jordan Peterson.com and you go into courses and you go into psychology for 30. If you look carefully there, you'll see that there's an essay rubric that tells people how to write and actually that's become quite popular. And so if you're interested in how to learn to write, I've written something about that already and we're going to make a piece of software that's going to help people learn to write. And so I've got plans for how to make writing education broadly accessible to people, so I would like to make humanities education of the highest order broadly accessible to people and I also want to teach them how to write and I'm going to try to crack the online university accreditation problem. And so part of the money that, or a substantial proportion of the money that is being donated to me, let's say, or is being offered to me by my monthly supporters.

Speaker 1:          05:28          So that's all of you people is going to be going to projects exactly like that. And the reason for that is that, what the hell else would I do with the money? You know, I mean, to me money is a tool. It's not, it's not the means whereby you develop a luxurious lifestyle and spend your time burning yourself half to death in the sun and the Caribbean snorting cocaine and chasing hookers, you know, it's just, that's just not in the cards for me. Um, and, and so I want to devote it towards the sorts of things that I've already been pursuing except on a broader scale. And so, you know, and I think people like Elan Musk to, not that I'm comparing myself to Elon Musk, but I mean he has plenty of money and I mean you really, somebody's got to have the damn money. It might as well be people who have the kind of vision that people like he does have because maybe they'll do something good for the world.

Speaker 1:          06:18          I mean I hope his gigafactories produce batteries like mad so that we can start to make alternative energy sources economically viable and maybe reduce our dependence on oil and maybe get ourselves out from underneath the thumb of the Saudi Arab. So that would be a good thing. So the monetary issue, it's, it's quite interesting. It's like it is not that you have the money, it's what you do with it. And so anyways, those are, some of them might plants and that isn't all of them because I'm going to come up with a bunch more plans and I'm going to try to implement them as rapidly as I possibly can. I've put my clinical practice on hiatus for the next three months so that I have a chance to think and I've requested that the university advanced my sabbatical by one year, so I should have about a year to think about what I should be doing with youtube and how I can be promoting broad public education of the highest quality and that's a really fun problem to solve and the fact that I'm being supported by all of you people on Patrion makes the probability that avail to all be able to devote my time to that much higher.

Speaker 1:          07:22          So, so that's what I'm going to do with it. I'm going to do the best things I can possibly think of to do with it. And uh, hopefully that'll work. And so far it seems to be going well. So, um, yeah, I mean I've been taking them back quite a bit by the. I mean it's not surprising that the people who've been trying to take me down, let's say are squawking and bitching because I happened to be a generating a fairly reasonable income from this. Although I don't think about it as an income, as I already said, I think about it as a, as a toolkit for pursuing more interesting things. It's like if that's the best they can do with regards to continuing to tarnish my name, well then let them, let them go right ahead about that and I think the proof is in the outcome and the biblical series and that's a direct consequence of the Patriot and support that seems to be going like mad. I think you know, about 500,000 people have watched the videos so far with another who knows, tens of thousands of people listening to the podcasts and that's just a bloody miracle that, that many people would be interested in what I consider the fundamental foundation for any true humanities education. So great. We'll build from there. And so that's, that's what I'm gonna do with the money. So. And if people don't like that, then they don't have to donate or they don't have to subscribe. It's hardly like it's mandatory.
