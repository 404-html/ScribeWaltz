Speaker 1:          00:00          First contributors to poverty are, well, it's not so good to have a low Iq. You know, people don't like the idea of Iq because it seems so arbitrary, you know, have a high Iq. Well it's not like you deserve it. Exactly. It's your setup that way pretty much right from the beginning. It's very, very, very, very stable. You can make a high Iq person stupider by not educating them up to the level of their possibility, but taking someone who has a low Iq and trying to raise that. It's like if you can figure out how to do that, well you know it's Nobel prize time for you because people have tried that a lot and most recently with those, you know, Luminol lumosity games and that sort of thing. And the evidence that those produce anything other than brilliant performances on the lumosity game itself is basically zero. We haven't been able to figure out how to see because intelligence is across domain phenomena and you can get really good in a single domain by practicing like mad and what you'd want is to practice like mad in a single domain and hope that it generalizes to other domains. That's the holy grail of intelligence increase. It's like, no, no one's done it. People claim it, but the claims never hold up and people have been trying for a long time to do it and they haven't been able to do it. And

Speaker 1:          01:27          differences in Iq really make a difference. You know, I mean you guys, average Iq is probably one slash 25. One 30 ad at 1:15. You're at the 85th percentile and 1:15 would barely get you going for you. For Harvard University, 1:30, you're probably graduate school material, you know, 1:45. You're up there at the range where you can probably do pretty much whatever you want. Although as you get smarter, the scatter between your abilities increase. So you might have a very high verbal Iq but not be so good at mathematics or the other way around, but it's a massive contributor to lifetime success. And I don't know what to do about that. I mean why do smart people make more money? Well they get to where the edge of production is faster. So if you have a thousand people and you rank order them by ICU, the smart people are going to come up with a new ideas first and they're gonna have more ideas and they're going to strategize better. And you know, with an Iq of 90, which is 15 percent of the population, you think about that 15 percent of the population. That's pretty much the threshold for reading instructions and being able to follow them.

Speaker 1:          02:55          So you know, and our society is increasingly sophisticated. So it's by no means obvious. You know, the Liberals Think, well society is unfair because there's unemployment and the Conservatives think while there's a job for everyone, but none of them think, well, there are massive, massive, massive differences in people's ability far greater than anyone realizes. And that poses a structural problem.
