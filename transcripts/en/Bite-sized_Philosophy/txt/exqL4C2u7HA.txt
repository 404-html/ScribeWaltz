Speaker 1:          00:00          When you claims, for example, that you throw the baby out with the bathwater when you're trying to develop and become a socially acceptable personality that happens in a different way as far as he's concerned for each of the genders and so one of the prices young would say that we pay and that this is a very modern idea in some ways for growing up as a distinctly gendered society, is that it's very easy for men to suppress and fail to develop, to develop those elements of their character that might be considered classically feminine and it's difficult for women to develop and express those aspects of their personality that might be classically considered masculine and but so young believer that nested inside the shadow in some sense where the Contra sexual capacities. So for example, for a man given what we knew about the temperamental difference between men and women. It may be that men could be more, could develop the capacity for true compassion and care if they,

Speaker 2:          01:18          huh?

Speaker 1:          01:20          They could find that ability within what they've thrown out in the shadow. And women, for example, could find the capacity to be aggressive and assertive because that's part of what they threw out during their stage of their course of development because of because of it's a priory categorization as inappropriate behavior. Now, that doesn't mean that you thought that there was, that people should be raised without any gender identity. That issue never came up for him. He just thought that once you had established a personality that was sufficiently developed to be acceptable socially and functional on the individual level, then you could have the opportunity to expand that personality and to take into yourself elements of of perception and thought and behavior

Speaker 2:          02:13          that

Speaker 1:          02:17          you wouldn't have had the sophistication to be able to handle at an earlier stage of development. So young would say perhaps that if you're a male, you have to become masculine before you could become feminine, and if you were a female, the reverse is true, but that if your development only star stops with a narrow and categorical gender identity, then there are elements that of of, of being that you could draw on that aren't at your disposal and that will make you weak. So the shadow breaks up into the anima anonymous and the atom is female inside the mail, so to speak, in the animist is the male inside the female and young believe that he could see those partial spirits manifesting themselves in people's behavior. And so he talked about a couple of typical behaviors that he thought were associated either with Anima possession, so that would be in the case of a man or animas possession in the case of a woman. And so he would regard. If you ever talk to someone who's female who seems to respond to all of your propositions with nothing but argumentation for the sake of argumentation. Human would regard that as a manifestation of possession by the animus. And if you ever talked to a man who is a irrationally possessed by

Speaker 1:          03:52          second rate and few tile emotions, then he would regard that as possession by the anima. So, and you can see that if you watch for it. And if you believe in such things, the best thing to do when confronted with someone who's Animus possessed is just shut up because you're not going to make any headway. Because the point of the argument of an animist inspired argument is to get you to argue not to win. Because by getting you to argue the animus wins.
