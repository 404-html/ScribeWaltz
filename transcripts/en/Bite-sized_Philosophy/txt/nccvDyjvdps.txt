Speaker 1:          00:00          It's painful to understand how much of what you're doing isn't productive. So I'll give you an example. So I've done this a couple of times with classrooms full of students. Usually when I'm lecturing about career development, say, okay, um, how much time do you waste? So then I get the class to vote. How many of you waste a 10 hours a day? It's like 10 percent of the kids will put up their hands. And it's interesting because I don't define what constitutes waste. I just asked the question. So they're diagnosing themselves, right? I'm not saying you're wasting 10 hours a day. I'm just asking. It's like given your own attitude, how much time you wasting 10 hours a day. It's like 10 percent of the people put up their hands. Well when you get to like six hours a day, 80 percent of the people put up their hands.

Speaker 1:          00:45          So then we do the arithmetic. It's like, because I like doing arithmetic with people. People hate arithmetic, but I like doing it. It's like, okay, six hours a day, 42 hours a week. So let's call that a work week. Forty hours a week, so, so that's, that's a work week, let's say what's your time worth, your university student or certainly worth minimum wage because obviously, but it's worth way more than that because if you spend a productive hour when you're 20 than you gain the benefits of that hour for the rest of your life. So there's the compounding effect of time spent when we were young. So I say, well let's assume your time's worth 50 bucks an hour, which I think is an underestimate, but whatever. Let's call it 50. We call it 25, but we'll call it 50. That's $2,000 a week. You're wasting it's $100,000 a year.

Speaker 1:          01:29          It's like, how much better would your life be if you weren't wasting $100,000 a year? It's like, what is that? Over 40 years, $4,000,000. It's like you're rich. You don't even know it. Quit wasting time by your own definition. It's like people shake their heads like, oh, I never thought about it that way. It's like, yeah, think about it that way. Don't waste your damn life. And then you think, well, why would people be resistant to that message? It's like, well, you really want to wake up and figure out that you're wasting half your life and you know, when people do that kind of wasting, they actually hate it. You know? And I've had lots of people come to my clinical practice who were chronic procrastinators, you know, and so they're watching youtube videos say, but, but not ones that are good for them, although sometimes they will do that, but just browsing and that kind of mindless way that you do when you're not paying attention and you're trying to kill time and people doing that, they feel bad, they get depressed, they feel anxious, they can't get away from it.

Speaker 1:          02:27          They feel kind of addicted. Saying about social media now. It's a huge issue with young kids. Absolutely. But there's this feeling of kind of internal rot and corruption that goes along with it. It's like, yeah, well you're wasting your life. It's like, so it's painful. It's painful to recognize that. Then it's painful to think, oh my God, look how undisciplined I am. I don't know anything. I can't use this schedule. I can't. I can't stick to a calendar. I don't have any aims. I don't know anything about the world. Right. And maybe there's a part of me that's bitter because I haven't got everything already and I'd like to say to hell with it. That's the recognition of the union shadow. It's like that's what makes you a vicious and, and, and, and untrustworthy all of that. No one wants to look at that and no bloody wonder. But Hey, the alternative is worse.
