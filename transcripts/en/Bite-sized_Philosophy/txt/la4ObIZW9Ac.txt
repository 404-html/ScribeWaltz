Speaker 1:          00:00          There's a whole set of expectations that are governing what we're doing, like you don't want me to take your your little tablet there and smash it. That would be shocking, right? You would know what the hell to do, right? You'd be somewhere different if I did that and you wouldn't know where you were and that's another thing to know because that's a fundamental difference. There is a fundamental difference between knowing where you are and not knowing where you are. I think it's in some sense the fundamental difference. You can think about it as the distinction between explored an unexplored territory, but you have to.

Speaker 1:          00:44          I don't know if you've ever taken a cat to a new house. Cats hate that, and because in their old house and maybe in their old neighborhood, they slunk around at the edges, checking everything out. They start out freight afraid. They check everything out. They know where to hide. They know where to. They knew, they knew, they know what safe and they know that because they go somewhere and nothing happens and so then the assuming that it's safe and they slowly build up a neighborhood that they're comfortable with. My Dad used to take the dog for a walk and then the cat got lonesome and so it started to follow him and first of all it would just go along the buildings, the houses on their route, no hiding really from predators and after awhile it got kinda comfortable with that and then it would follow right behind the dog, but it had a border and if my dad took the dog over one street too many for the cat, the cat would just sit on the corner and you know, cry like a cap cries.

Speaker 1:          01:45          It was like, that's it for me, man. I'm not going any farther out into the unknown. And so the distinction between the territory that you have mastered and the territory that you haven't mastered is a fundamental distinction. It's the distinction between home and the strange land. And the thing about familiar territory for people is that most of the familiar territory that we inhabit is other people because we're so social. So you can't really think it's a weird way of thinking about territory. It's not exactly geographical objective territory. It's territory with a dominance hierarchy in it and the dominance hierarchy has a predictable structure and you know where you fit in it most of the time. And so that when you act out in that territory surrounded by Europe, people then often you get what you want and you're so thrilled about that because you just don't want someone acting radically around you. Like, and you know that. So he walked down bloor and there's people there that should really be institutionalized. But we did institutionalize them all so they could be free and free to be, you know, suffering and malfunctioning out on the street. That's what the freedom ended up being. But you know, you'll walk by someone like that who's moderating away to the voices in his head, didn't, you know, maybe

Speaker 1:          03:13          striking out against whatever it is that's plaguing him. And you will make eye contact. You might even go across the street, you're certainly going to give him a wide berth. You're going to keep a distance between him and you and you're going to hope that you don't attract his attention because he's not in the dominance hierarchy and you don't know what the hell he might do and that's unexplored territory too. That's another way of thinking about it, like we inhabit time and space, not just space and not just time. We inhabit time and space and our territories are spacial. Temporal. We're here now and this is safe now and it saved partly because of the physical structure and it's working, but it's also safe because none of you are manifesting peculiar behavior, but if you started to manifest peculiar behavior, if you stood up and started monitoring or yelling or maybe attacking someone next to you, all the rest of you would freeze first because then all of a sudden this would be unexplored territory. The match between what you want, which is a peaceful lecture that you hope has some content. The match between what you want and what's happening has vanished and so then you're not. You don't know where you are and so then what do you do when you don't know where you are? What do you do when you don't know what to do? Well, if you're your computer, you just crash,

Speaker 2:          04:45          but

Speaker 1:          04:47          you know what good is that to you? You're just going to die. That isn't helpful. You freeze first and then maybe you cautiously, cautiously attended, or maybe you don't. Maybe you just keep your damn eyes averted and you sit there and you hope that no one notices you. That's a Predator or prey response, right? That's like a rabbit frozen when it thinks a fox is looking at it and we were prey animals for a long time. There was a cat that they recently discovered, a prehistoric cat that had this bottom single tooth and they found out that a human skull fit right inside its mouth and so it could grab you here and Pierce the back of your skull with its with its single tooth and that's what it was evolved for. So you know it's under such conditions. We evolved and we're predators obviously, but were tasty predators and so other things were perfectly happy to eat us. And so when you're aware you don't know what to do, you act like a prey animal and that's probably what you shouldn't do because maybe if you keep your head down and shut the hell up there, be any attention to attracted to you and maybe you'll get through it. You know, you, you might decide unlikely to intervene and take the guy down, but, but you would be the exception rather than the norm. And it's unsurprising.
