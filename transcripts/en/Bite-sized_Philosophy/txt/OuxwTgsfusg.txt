Speaker 1:          00:00          The two on the left are Jonah, Jonah,

Speaker 1:          00:04          and the whale. So the story of Jonah is an interesting one. Oh, I'll just go over it very briefly. There's a city and the city is full of people who are sinful. What does that mean? Well, to sin is an archery term. It means to miss the mark. So these are people who aren't oriented properly and so the city is in a chaotic state and God tells Jonah that he's going to go to that city and tell them just exactly what's up with them. And Joanie, thanks. No, I'm not going to do that. And why? Well, that doesn't require much explanation. It's like how popular you are going to be if you go to a city full of chaotic people and tell them why they're stupid did wrong. It's Joanna. Thanks. No, I'm not going to do that. I don't care if God's telling me to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:48          So his conscience is telling him to do it or his destiny is telling them to do it or, or his orientation with higher morality is telling them to do it. You can read it any way you want, and so he thinks, no, I'm harping on this boat and I'm getting as far away from that city as I possibly can, and so he does that and then the storm comes up because God thinks, no, you're not getting away. If I told you to do something, you're not getting away from it. A storm comes up. Well, what does that mean? Well, it's easy. Betray your destiny and see how long it takes you to be. Drowning in a storm

Speaker 1:          01:26          will happen immediately, and of course it will, because what? What's calling you to be your best is exactly the thing that's pushing you forward, to manifest yourself most fully in the world. It's what you need. You run away from that. The boat's going to start to rock very, very quickly. When you all know that you know that perfectly well, it, it, it's hell. All you have to do is not study for an exam that you know that's coming up to see everything. Start to the storm. Water start to rise and everything start to rock. It's pretty bloody obvious. So anyways, he's on this boat and there's a storm and all of the people on the boat who who can't quite discriminate chaos from whether because they haven't differentiated the world to that degree, thank. Oh the boat wouldn't be about to be swamped if we hadn't.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Some of us had done something stupid and wrong and there's logic in that, you know, you might think, well God has nothing personal against you because of the storm, so you're confusing levels of analysis, but you've got to give these people some credit. So like maybe they didn't do something stupid, maybe they didn't caulk the damn boat properly. Maybe the ropes aren't in as good as shape as they might be. Maybe they weren't paying attention to the weather when they went out on the ocean, you know? Or maybe they haven't made peace with their brother and so their hearts are bent, twisted out of shape. So they don't make particularly good sailors. It's like the idea that you encounter a storm because you're stupid and wrong. Is it really good idea? Even though it's not an infinite applicability anyways, they draw lots. It's a primitive thing to do.

Speaker 1:          02:58          It's like, wow, it's one, it's someone's fault. We don't know who we're going to throw someone overboard. The worst sinner. Obviously that's what God wants. Some kind of sacrifice. So they all draw lots and someone loses and then Jonah stands up and says, well, sorry guys, like I know that I've got a problem with God at the moment so it's probably me. You better throw me over and they don't really want to. But he finally convinces them over. He goes, and that storm settles. Well, you know, sometimes if you're in a group of people in an organization, there is someone in the organization who's head is screwed on exactly straight and they know exactly why it is and what they've done wrong and what puts them in that position and they are poisoning the entire enterprise and if you throw them overboard or better, if they agreed voluntarily to leave, then this storm will abate and everything will be okay.

Speaker 1:          03:50          So anyways, they throw joe job over or Jonah overboard and a whale comes up and swallows them and take them down to the bottom of the ocean. Well, we already know what that means because we watched Pinocchio. It's like when God abandons you because you've abandoned your destiny and the storms come up, the probability that you're going to be taken down to the, to the depths is extraordinarily high, and that happens in people's lives all the time. Also down there, Jonah repents. Well, what do you do when you were in the underworld? When you've been there before, when things fall apart on your friends have abandoned you. You're not as popular as you could be. You can't stand to look at yourself in the mirror into the underworld. You go and you think, Geez, I've done a lot of things wrong. You know, maybe I should reconcile myself with the world that I could get out of this wall.

Speaker 1:          04:34          So that's what Jonah does. He thinks, all right, I've got this destiny. I better go do what God says. So the whale spit some out onto the beach and off he goes to the city to tell them what's wrong. Well, that's what that represents. That's these symbols. You know, it's so cool. This second one, I really, I really like. It's so interesting because you see Jonah and reemerging from the whale and he's got a halo around his head and you say, well, what's a halo? Have you ever looked at a quarter? Well, think about a quarter. A quarter is the moon and who's on the quarter? The Queen, the queen is surrounded by the halo of the Moon, the Queens Queen of the Queen of the night gold coin. That's the king's head on the sun. That's the halo. Well, what comes out of the belly of the fish? It's the illuminated human being.

Speaker 1:          05:25          It's the spirit of the illuminated human being. That's what that means. Well, what does that mean? Well, what else would come out of chaos? You know, if you, if you fall apart and then you put yourself back together, what is it that comes back out? At least you're in better shape than you were before, you know, and then maybe you do that 20 times in your life or 50 times and you do it voluntarily. Every time you do it, you're more like the thing with the halo and less like the thing that's being thrown overboard by your friends.
