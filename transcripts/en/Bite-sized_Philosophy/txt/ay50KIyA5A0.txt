Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay, so anyways, back to the equity thing of all the postures and idiotic ideas. So first of all, to make gender equity across every dimension of a, of a, of an organization, you have to assume that men and women have identical interests or, and, and temperaments, and that if they don't, the state should intervene to bloody well ensure that they do, which is something for all you women to figure out because now there's many, uh, many what a positions in society that women preferentially occupied. So what are you going to do about that and what are you going to do about the Asians because they occupied preferential positions as well. You know, they're overrepresented in all sorts of professional institutions and the probability is that that's going to increase. What are you going to do about that? What about the Jews are going to do about them because they have, they're in the same position as they Asians going to put quotas on all those people.

Speaker 1:          00:56          What kind of stupidity is that? And then it's worse too, because let's say you equalize women and accrued for just for the sake of argument across all these different dimensions of society. Well then what are you going to do it? You're going to, are you going to equalize for black women and Latino Women and Asian women? Are you going to sub type black women because it's not like they're all the same. Are you going to ensure that women from lower classes are are represented just as much as women from upper classes and how many generations back are you going to go to check that? What about intelligence? What about attractiveness? How about height? How about weight? So the problem with the fractionation by group identity is that it's endless. There's no way of ensuring equality across groups because there's an infinite number of groups you can fragment group identity all the way down into the level of the individual, which is exactly what you should do.

Speaker 1:          01:47          Which is what we already did in the West. We figured, well, the ultimate diverse population is a population of individuals. So you let the individuals sorted out. No, no, we're going to replace that with group. Well, what that means for the bloody social activists is that they'll be able to play this game forever because you can continually fractioning group identity ad nauseum and so the system will never be equal and you can bloody well be sure that as we implement social policy to make sure that all outcomes are equal, but the amount of space that you personally are going to have to maneuver in is going to shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink. We've already seen that happen in many societies. You think we would learn from the 20th century.
