Speaker 1:          00:00          Chimps, I don't know if you know this or not, but chimps basically go to war. Uh, Jane Goodall discovered that a couple of decades ago and it really, really was hard on her because she was kind of a ruse soliah. So for those of you don't know John, John Jacques Rousseau is a French philosopher and you know, French philosophers have a lawful lot of sins on their conscience and of course we. So it was certainly one of them because Russell was the first, like what fully articulate promoter of the idea that human beings were basically good. So we know we had a good soul in a moral sense, but we were corrupted by our social institutions, you know, so, um,

Speaker 1:          00:40          so, you know, as far as Russo was concerned, it was kind of a noble savage idea, you know, like the human being in their raw form has a pure soul and then you know, you, you give them to parents and you'd give them to teachers and you know, they'd get into politics and there's group disputes and then they get all corrupted, you know, and well, you know, that's, I don't know even what to say about that except that it's absolutely moronic keynote, but it's, it's an appealing proposition if you're naive optimist. I mean, first of all, it doesn't explain where malevolence comes from because the people created the institution. So, you know, it just puts you into an infinite regress chicken and egg if the institutions are reprehensible, but the people who built them aren't then where did the reprehensible elements that the institutions come from?

Speaker 1:          01:22          You know, he might think it's an audio generating consequences of organizing people. But you know, it's a pretty specious theory. So I'm of course he had a counterpart of philosophical counterpart, Thomas Hobbs and Hobbs said basically exactly the opposite, that you know, people were vicious and cruel unless you like put them in straight jackets fundamentally and made them obey. Then everything was going to go immediately to help you know, when, when, when you saw what happened in Iran after the Americans walled stand in, the power structure disintegrated. Do you know what was a hell of a lot more like than it was like Russell, right? You took out the tyrant at the top and it wasn't like everybody got all peaceful and loving. All of a sudden it was like absolute chaos reigned. So you know, of course you can rationalize that. But anyways, roost. So by the way, had five children by illiterate made that that was as Mr. and you put every single one of them in orphanages where of course they perished because orphanages have Russo's times. We're not exactly, you know, a luxury resort. And even up until the beginning of the 20th century, most children who are under one years of age who were in care institutions died partly disease. And that sort of thing, but often because they just weren't touched, they weren't cared for physically. Even if they were fed and you know, 200 years ago they weren't even fed

Speaker 1:          02:43          anyway, so, you know, but nonetheless, you know, people have people

Speaker 1:          02:47          maintain the optimistic idea that human beings were basically good and that they were corrupted by institutions. It's a common idea among. I think it's a very common idea in universities, you know, because university people are always complaining about the corrupt nature of this institution and that institution, you know, while they sit here in the warm with the electricity on, you know, it's surrounded by wealth that characterizes maybe one 10th of one percent of the entire world's population. And you know, they complained about how we'll press they are and how will we know nasty the institutions are. It's like, yeah, well you actually haven't been to a nasty institution, you know, cause nasty institutions. They get pretty damn bad. And most of the institutions in the world are like that. So it isn't exactly clear that people are pristine in their heart and then corrupted by institutions.

Speaker 1:          03:34          Although I'm sure that happens patent depends around, for example. So anyways, this has been a line of philosophical speculation. That's, that's, that's I would say constituted one of the unspoken fundamental assumptions of, of Western intellectuals in particular. And Jane Goodall thought, you know, in many ways the same way she thought chimps were basically, you know, they're just animals. They are okay. They exist, coexist relatively peacefully with one another, you know, even, um, Carl Rogers, who I talk about a bit in my personality class, you know, he basically thought that people are fundamentally good and that institutions make them bad. But, uh, the problem is you look at chimps and narrow a fair bit like us, you know, Bonobos, you can look at them too, and they're, they're genetically quite related to us and they're quite a bit different than chimps, but. So we're sort of a weird mixture of the two in some sense.

Speaker 1:          04:29          But Champs, like those things, there is no evidence that they really have any internal control over their regression at all. You know, there was a horrible case about two years ago where a woman was interacting with the chimp and it tore her to pieces and they can do that. Man took her face right off and they have the strength of about six men, like an, an, uh, an adult. Male chimp can break a 300 pound test cable, you know, those things are really, really strong and they are not friendly, you know, like. So in Arnhem Zoo for example, there's been a troop of chimps there that have been followed by an extremely brilliant apartment hall and just named Frans de Waal who's work I would very highly recommend. The Wall is a very smart guy and he's looked at the origins of morality and chimpanzees, you know, from a biological perspective, it's very, very nice work.

Speaker 1:          05:21          Very, very clearheaded. But you know, he's recounted absolutely horrific stories of chimpanzee behavior. So one of the stories he talked about, for example, was, you know, when you kind of have this idea that there's a mail chimp hierarchy, it's roughly true. There's a female hierarchy too, but the males and the chimp world anyways tend to be the dominant ones and you know, you kind of think of a dominant primate like a prize fighter, you know, pretty much he's ruling because of his physical prowess. Now that turns out not to exactly be true, but in this particular case, the guy who was running the chimp troop was a bit of a bully and he wasn't very good at making friends. You know, and that's not such a good idea because no matter how tough you are by yourself to weaker guys can probably take you out.

Speaker 1:          06:02          And that's what happened during friends to was observations and two chimps attack the leader and they had a coalition. They were grooming each other. They repels, you know, in chimps are pretty good at remembering like risk reciprocal relationships and having friendships really. Like they have a very highly social structure. Hey, just tore him apart. Like the things they did to him like you don't even want to talk about. And so chimps have really no upper limit on their capacity for aggression and when they hunt. Because chimps, Honda and they liked me, they often call us monkeys and they weigh about 35 pounds, like a cola. This monkeys a major league animal, and they eat those things alive and they scream while they're being killed and that does not slow the chimps down one bit. So it's not obvious that the chimp is really a creature of a lot of empathy, especially the males.

Speaker 1:          06:45          The females are likely more empathic because they have to deal with infants for longer periods of time. What seems to inhibit the aggression of mail chimp's isn't anything they hold internally. It seems that when they get hyper aggressive in the truth, the truth gets more and more agitated and basically shuts them down. So you can imagine maybe you're in a rough bar and some Dingbat who was, you know, half psychopathic and has had two pints of alcohol is starting to cause a tremendous amount of trouble and he's not going to shut himself down, but the rest of the truth might. And that kind of means that the control over the aggression is externalized. It's not a consequence of super ego control. And we like to think that we actually control our own aggression, but I'm not so sure about that. You know, if you read things like there's a great book, Horrifying Book published about 20 years ago called the rape of Nanking, which is while the woman who wrote it committed suicide.

Speaker 1:          07:37          So that sort of suffices to tell you what the rape of Nanking is about. And it's a story about the Japanese in World War II going into a Chinese kid city called Nan King where I believe about 350,000 people were killed. And the Nazis in that story where the good guys. So you can imagine the kind of brutality that might be occurring there. But there's absolutely perfectly well documented evidence suggesting that the Japanese soldiers engaged in competitive brutality. You know. And so really what happened was the Japanese had been pretty militarized by World War Two and native adopted a Prussian education system and the Russians and Germans, you know, pre, Pre 20th century Germans, they were basically interested in educating obedient soldiers, you know, because it was a militaristic culture and the Japanese kind of adopted that because they were sick of being kicked around by the Europeans and pretty successfully because they defeated the Russians, you know, in the early stages of Roe or of the 20th century.

Speaker 1:          08:33          It was quite a shock to everyone in Europe and, you know, cause for great celebration in Japan and no wonder. But anyways, they militarize the hell out of their young men and taught them basically that the Japanese were a master race, you know, and that other people were sub humans. It's a very common human way of thinking, by the way. I would say it's really the default way that human tribes think about other tribes. You what? I mean, it's a little more complicated than that because human tribes tend to trade with other tribes. So it's not all demonization, but a lot of it is, you know, and if you look around the world in the anthropological literature, what you see is that the names that most tribes have for themselves is something like that, human beings or the people you know, indicating that the rest of the people are reading people, God only leader, barbarians or you know, they live out where the sun is being eaten by the dragon of the night or something like that.

Speaker 1:          09:23          And you know, the word barbarian is a, is a word that comes from the Greeks making fun of how non-greek spoke. Know they thought they were bar bar, Bar, Bar, Bar, something like that. So anyways, what goodall phone was the chimps, the chimp, adolescence in particular in particular, the males would patrol the borders of their territory, uh, in groups of three or four and with often with a female or two. But the females didn't seem to be really the, the, the, they weren't, they were more part of the group rather than the initiators. But what the chimps would do is if they found a chimp from another troop, even if that was a chimp that had moved from their troop in the not too distant past and joined another, because sometimes the males leave and sometimes they go to other troops. If they are numbered them, they would tear them to pieces and it looked like that's why they were doing the border patrol.

Speaker 1:          10:15          They're out looking for trouble there. Gangs roughly speaking, they're looking for trouble. But the point of it is is that, and they would only attack if they have numbers because chimps can. I wouldn't say they count, but they have a rudimentary notion of group size. You know, I don't think you can count without being able to verbalize, but you can estimate at a glance. And so, you know, when I mean, when I say tear apart, that's exactly what I mean. There's no upper limit on the brutality. And so good all discovered that first. And she didn't tell anybody above it. Now she had a reasons. I mean some of them I think radiological or the lovely chimps, you know, and fair enough. But some of it was also she thought that maybe the chimps had been corrupted as a consequence of their contact with human beings and that their natural behavior had been somehow transform, you know, and that's not, it's reasonable to be cautious if you're a scientist before you go out and say, hey, chimps go to war. Isn't that revolutionary? Because it is, right? Because it just, it just ends. The idea that our war, like and malevolent nature is a function of culture. Like if chimps do it well, what are they perverted by their own culture? I don't think so. You know, I mean there are more and less violent chimp cultures and there are more and less violent baboons culture. So there was some cultural variation, but since goodall's time, this sort of behavior is being documented on many, many chimp truths. So that's us in a nutshell.
