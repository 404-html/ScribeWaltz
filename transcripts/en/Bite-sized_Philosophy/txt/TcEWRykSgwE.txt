Speaker 1:          00:00          And by the time the Soviet revolution came around, which would be at the latter part of the 19 tens after the first world war, the peasant class had actually established farms, of course, varying productivity. Some of the peasant farmers were very, very good at being farmers and produced a huge proportion of rushes and the Ukraine's food. Because one of the things we'll talk about this later, as the class progresses, one of the things that you'll find if that if you look at creative production in any domain, it doesn't matter. Artistic Domain, food production novels, written novel, Soul, money generated, number of companies, generated, number of goals, scored in hockey, et cetera. Any number of paintings, painted, number of compositions, written, anything like that. Where where the fundamental underlying measure as human productivity, what you find is that a very tiny percentage of people produce almost all of the output.

Speaker 1:          00:58          It's called a pareto distribution. P A r e t o, and it was studied in detail in scientific productivity by someone named does solar price. It's a square root law. So here's the law. Fundamentally, if you look at the number of people who are doing, who are, who are in a given domain, who are producing in a given domain, the square root of the people produce half the product, so that means if you have 10 employees, three of them do half the work, but if you have 10,000 employees, 100 of them do half the work, right? It's a very, very vicious statistic and you won't learn about that in psychology for reasons I have no idea about because you learned about the normal distribution and not the prieto distribution, but pareto distributions govern, for example, the distribution of money, which is why one percent of the people in the general population have the overwhelming amount of money and one 10th of that one percent has almost all of that.

Speaker 1:          01:52          Right? So I think it's like the richest 100 people in the world have as much money as the bottom two and a half billion and you think, well that's a terrible thing, and perhaps it is. But what you have to understand is that that law governs the distribution of creative production across all creative domains. Right, it's something like a natural law and we can. We'll talk about that more, but imagine what happens when you play monopoly. You've all played monopoly. What happens when you play monopoly? One person ends up with all the money, right? Then you play another game of monopoly. What happens? One person ends up with all the money. It's actually the inevitable consequence of multiple trades that are conducted randomly. So if you take a thousand people and you get them to play a trading game, you get each give them $100, say or $10, and they have to trade with another person.

Speaker 1:          02:39          By flipping a coin I. When the coin toss you give me a dollar, you win, I give you a dollar. If we all play that long enough, one person will end up with all the money and everyone else will end up with zero. So it's a deeply built feature of systems of creative production and no one really knows what to do about it because of course the danger is is that all the resources get funneled to a tiny minority of people at the top and a huge section of the population stacks up at zero. But to blame that on the oppressive nature of a given system is to radically underestimate the complexity of the problem. No one actually knows how to effectively shovel resources from the minority that that controls almost everything to the majority. That has almost nothing in any consistent way. Because as you shovel money down, it tends to move right back up and it's a big problem.

Speaker 1:          03:31          Anyways. The reason I'm telling you about that is because after the peasants were granted their land and started to become farmers, a tiny minority of them became extremely successful and those people produced almost all of the food for Russia and Ukraine. So what happened in the 19 twenties when bloody lennon came along and collectivize the farms, was that they defined the Kulaks who were these tiny minority of successful farmers who maybe had a brick house and were able to hire a couple of people and had some land in some livestock and were very productive people. They define them as socially unfriendly elements and they sent groups of intellectuals out into the towns to collectivize the farms. And so the idea was that while you would pool your land and and everyone would farm it collectively and the land was taken away, of course from the tiny minority of people who are actually productive and had actually managed to own much of the land.

Speaker 1:          04:23          So you have to imagine how that would occur. Okay. So it's in the 19 twenties, it's after the world. After World War One rushes in pretty bad shape. The villages are full of brutalized men who have posttraumatic stress disorder and lots of people who are not doing well at all in the bloody intellectuals come into the town and they say, you know, those successful farmers up the street that you've always been pretty jealous about in your useless manner while they're actually pigs and demons who are stealing from you. So why don't you come out. We'll form a nice little mob and we'll take everything they've got. And that's exactly what happened. And all those people were killed or raped or set off to Siberia in the middle of the bloody winter where there wasn't even anything for them to. To anywhere for them to live or anything for them to eat. So they all died. And then the consequence of that was a few years later, 6 million people starved to death in the Ukraine.
