Speaker 1:          00:00          And you might say, well, what's your evidence that those differences in personality aren't culturally constructed and the evidence for that, it's quite clear. You can go online, you look up the Scandinavian studies, let's go online and look up gender differences in personality cross-culturally. You'll find the relevant studies they've been done with tens of thousands of people or something she'll write clearly is in those societies where the most is being done to move, move the social world into a position of radical equality. And so that would roughly be the Scandinavian countries because they've done more than that, more of that than any other country. The personality differences between men and women maximize, they don't minimize, they maximize. And I'll say that again in the countries where they're most has been done to equalize that playing field between men and women. Men and women get more different rather than more of the same. So for all your social constructionists out there in the audience, and there's probably not that many of you because you wouldn't come in here and be talked to her social constructionist. You're actually wrong. Yeah. Well, and the thing is,

Speaker 2:          01:07          thank you,

Speaker 1:          01:17          so one of the things you might be interested in is that it's all the same to me. Subsets like when I was looking into this to begin with in this group started probably 25 years ago, looking at differences in personality between men and women, you know, it doesn't go at all whether they were fundamentally biological, biological are fundamentally associate, large boiler or mixed produced the differences, you know, no one knew and the most logical hypothesis was that as you need wise, this society that men and women would become more of the same, but that is not what happened. And so we've actually looked at social constructionist hypothesis with regards to gender differences in insects and personality. We'll put that to the test and a very intense way and the social constructionist viewpoint fail. So it's very strange because no one was already believed that, right?

Speaker 1:          02:05          If you make this make society one of the same in men and women get more different. Sorry, what's up with that? Well, the answer seems to be is that there's fundamentally two sources of variability in personality, right? There's perhaps more, but you can categorize them as roughly genetic and roughly sociological. Well, if you take out all the sociological differences between the landscape in which men and women are raped and all you have left are the biological and genetic differences, so they maximize, well, that's exactly what happened. This actually matters. It really matters and this is why that demands for equity or so. Well, there's 15 reasons why demands for equity order on this is between men and women should not be overlooked. Partly because it's wrong to overlook the junior with differences between men and women. It's not good for the man. It's not good for the women.

Speaker 1:          02:54          So one of the things you see in Scandinavia, for example, is there's an overwhelming preponderance female nurses and there's an overwhelming preponderance of male engineers and actually the data on, on personality differences. Um, there's, there's, there's the standard traits which will continue to go through. I can do that quite quickly. There's no much difference in trait conscientiousness between men and women. If you break it down into the aspects, women are a bit more orderly than men, but there's no difference in industriousness and then with regards to openness, which is the intelligence, intellect, creativity, dimension overall, there's no difference between men and women, but if you break it up into the aspects, then the differences are actually quite pronounced. So what you have is the openness to experience is the technical trade and it roughly breaks down into something that's sort of like created creativity and aesthetic interests versus the interest in ideas and what you see is that women are a third of the standard deviation higher than men in terms of of creativity and aesthetic aesthetic proclivity, let's say, and men or month or the standard deviation higher than women in terms of interest in ideas and it's not a trivial difference and it makes a difference.

Speaker 1:          04:06          So, but the biggest difference between men and women as it turns out, and this is almost one standard deviation, which is a wall of indifference. You never see that in social sciences and massive difference is the difference between difference in interest and the masculine interest. Roughly speaking is in face and the female interest, roughly speaking is in people and that's what underlies the differences say in, in, in career choice preference between things like nursing and psychology and social work and that sort of thing and engineering. And uh, because engineering is perhaps the most male oriented about the disciplines and the evidence that that's a sociological is very, very unique.
