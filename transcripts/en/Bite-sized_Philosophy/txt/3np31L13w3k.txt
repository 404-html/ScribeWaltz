Speaker 1:          00:00          Iliads idea was this, that things fall apart of their own accord merely because they age that that's the first motif in the flood story and that's only to say that if you build something, it indicates if you build something and you just leave it the hell alone, it will soon not work. Right? And that's entropy. So one of the reasons that the flood always threatens is merely because of entropy. And you see that reflected in the Egyptian story because one of the reasons that, oh, cyrus falls prey to seth is because these old, you know, he was a great hero when he was young and created the Egyptian state, like the men of renown. But now he's old and it's worse. He's willfully blind, but that's the next thing. But the fact that he's old is just to start things fall apart of their own accord.

Speaker 1:          00:45          So once something is given to you, you have to maintain it just to ensure its continued existence. And so you actually, you actually have a contract with most of the things that you own. It's like a, it's like a moral contract. Let's say you have a car or you've decided that you're going to sacrifice to have the car and so you've, you've performed an ethical calculation, but the car was only worth the sacrifice as long as it functions as a car and so what that means is that to justify the sacrifice you've made, to have the car, you have to maintain the car because otherwise you're acting out the proposition that the thing you sacrificed for actually didn't have any value and so your obliterating that as a useful contract and you run into the situation where the car will just deteriorate of its own accord and then you won't have a car at all.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Well, so let's say, how do you speed the process by which your car deteriorates? Well, that's easy. You're driving it along the road and it starts to make a ticking noise. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, and you think I should go have that ticking noise checked because you've heard it and then you think, Nah, it won't matter. It's like, yeah, probably it will matter. And what is matter mean well matter his mother. That's chaos to you no matter. But what it means is that that little ticking noise is the birthplace of tire matt in your car. That's a good way of thinking about it is that it's your first indication that the dragon of chaos is going to manifest itself in your car. That happens when you. I've got a funny story about that. So I had a friend in graduate school, someone I really liked, but I wouldn't call her mcelliott mechanically inclined, let's put it that way.

Speaker 1:          02:23          And she had an old Honda and those things were notorious for rusting out. This is 30 years ago when they were first produced. They weren't adapted well to Canadian winters and we used to go into her car and her Honda and it got a little on the scary side because it was so rusty underneath that you can actually see through the floorboards. And that actually made me nervous because if you can see through the floorboards, that means that they're not really floorboards. What they are is like rust. And so I mentioned the fact that that might be a problem to her a couple of times, but she was sort of blind about it and one day she was driving down St Lawrence Street in Montreal, which is the main running roughly north and south and her hood popped up it band and popped up spontaneously. And so she was really curious about that.

Speaker 1:          03:07          And so she was with this friend of hers and was just as clueless mechanically as she was, which is really quite remarkably clueless. And so they pulled off into a service station and had the guy come out and look at it. And well, he, he opened the hood obviously. And what had happened was the body had fallen off the frame. So. And what had happened was the shock, which is supposed to be attached to the car, had pushed up through the, through the, the hood. So literally the car body had fallen onto the ground and. But she was, she managed to drive the cart. Okay. So look, that's, I wouldn't exactly call that willful blindness because perhaps there is an element of willful blindness. She didn't know anything about mechanics, but you get the point, right. It's like, let's say she would been in a fatal accident. You might say, well, you can shake your fist at God for producing the circumstances, but you know the fact that you could see through the floorboards, that's probably something that you might have paid attention to, and so it's always. The question is this, if things fall apart around you, to what degree is it the mere tendency of things to degenerate entropically because they do that of their own accord or have you sped the probability of decay by failing to pay attention? When a little snake manifests itself inside your paradise.
