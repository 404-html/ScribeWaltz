Speaker 1:          00:00          I don't want my young children indoctrinated with dangerous ideas. Um, and as time marches on, I trust public education less and less. I know that you have strong thoughts on the danger of the devouring oedipal mother who harms her child by protecting them. And that's certainly not what I aspire to. I wonder if in spite of your idea that kids need to become tough and learn to slay dragons, if you have anything good to say about the idea of homeschooling.

Speaker 2:          00:28          Well, I don't have anything bad to say about it. I do know that the government has recently taken moves to make it much more difficult for people to homeschool their children. And it's not like five years. I mean, 15 years ago I would have presumed that the vast majority of people who were homeschooled schooling their children were to be viewed with skepticism. Initially. I'm not so sure about that anymore. You know, for example, I was sent a poster today. Someone sent me this link that they found in the local junior high school and one of the media pieces that were recommended on this poster was a movie called Hedwig. And the angry inch now I thought that was a terrible movie even though I'm perfectly capable of enjoying bizarre movies, but. So it's a bizarre movie, that's for sure. But I also thought it was a terrible bitter movie.

Speaker 2:          01:28          Terrible and bitter. Those are separate. A movie can be bitter and be quite great, but it was a terrible movie and it was a bitter movie. But I can tell you one bloody thing about that movie. It's not required viewing for 12 year old kids, that's for sure. So I think you have increasing reason to be skeptical of the public education system. I also looked at the Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario's guidelines for education from kindergarten to grade eight. And what that is in essence, and I think I will do a video about it in the relatively near future, is a blueprint for transforming children into social justice warriors. Have basically says that it's like you don't have to be a conspiracy theory to read that. I mean, we have social justice tribunals in Ontario and so the idea is, well, if you're going to get your children, if you're going to get people to, what would you say favor equity properly?

Speaker 2:          02:23          Well then you better start teaching them while they're young. It's like maybe not. So now you, you asked that question properly because he's say, well, the terrible education system, the wonderful mother homeschooling, right? That's the danger. It's like, no, because it might not be the wonderful mother homeschooling. It might be the pathological mother using the pathology of the education system as an excuse to get her talons into her children. Right? Because that's certainly equally possible or perhaps even more possible because at least in the public education, there's some necessity for consensus. So that's something that you have to be very aware of and work to prevent. Right. And so I would say if you're going to do that, probably best not to do it on your own and you need. It's like you need a board of advisors or something like that. And so maybe it can't just be you and you have to figure out, well what, what is the name and how are you going to manage that and what makes you think you can do it even if it's being done badly publicly.

Speaker 2:          03:28          What makes you think you could do it better? I mean, my general advice is, and people have asked me this, in fact, I had a conversation with the guy who was tiling my backyard this morning about something his son had said to him that he was taught at school recently, which really made the tyler who had come from a rather authoritarian country, step back on his heels and think, I'm not so sure I should be sending my kid to public school anymore and maybe I shouldn't be living in Toronto even, you know. But my general advice is keep an eye on your kids and discuss with them what they're learning and, and help equip them with the tools to

Speaker 2:          04:09          not only to articulate their own viewpoint in response to what they're being taught now at. The problem is you might not have the time, nor the ability to do that. That's no simple thing and increasingly if you're unwilling to have your children participate in what is increasingly indoctrination and not education, thanks to in no small part to the Ontario Institute of Studies on Education, which is an institution that I particularly despise because I think that all it does is almost all it does now is produce indoctrinates of children. It's not an easy, it's not an easily easy problem to solve, so more more power to you wanting to put your children in a situation where they're not being indoctrinated, but the alternative is very, very complicated and difficult. So

Speaker 3:          05:07          yeah, thanks.
