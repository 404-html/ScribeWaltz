Speaker 1:          00:00          Alright, so what does the frame look like? Well, I think it looks something like this, and this is as far as I can tell, this is the bare bones. This is the bare bones of a variety of things. It's a barebone story. It's a bare bone conceptual framework. It's a bare bone [inaudible] scientists to speak in Heideggerian terms. It's like it's the bare bones world that you live in. You're always in one of these worlds. There's no getting out of them. You can move from one to another, but you're always in a world like this and so this is the world that you're in. You're somewhere because you have to be somewhere now. You might not know where that is, which means that somewhere that you are is chaotic, in which case you need to go over your past in great detail and figure out where you are.

Speaker 1:          00:42          It's like you're lost, you're lost, and the problem with being last is when you're lost, you don't know where to go. And the problem with not knowing where to go is there's a million places that you could go and a million places is too many places for you to go without dying. So being lost is not good. So you need to know where you are. One of the things that we built online, my partners and I is this program called past authoring that helps people lay out the, the, the narrative of their past to identify, to break their life down into six stages, epochs we called them and then to identify the emotionally significant moments in each park and to write them out what happened negatively, what happened positively, what the consequences were, what you derive from it, perhaps what you could've done differently, perhaps what you learned from it, all of that so that you can narrow in zero in on determining precisely where it is that you are right now.

Speaker 1:          01:39          And people are often loathe to do that because they actually don't want to know because they'd rather be spread out in a sort of half blind manner in the fog. Hoping that the place that they're at is better than it really is. And deluding themselves by remaining vague than to figure out I'm right here right now with these specific problems, but it's actually better to to do that because if you have a set of specific problems and you've really narrowed them down and really specified them, then you can probably start fixing them and you can start fixing them and Mike Microwave's bit by bit, but there's no way you can do that without knowing where you are. It's impossible and you can kind of tell if you don't know where you are. It's quite straightforward. If you are haunted by reveries of the past for events that are older than approximately 18 months.

Speaker 1:          02:31          If they continue to come up in your mind over and over and your dreams over and over, you haven't extracted the world out from your past experiences. That potential is still trapped in the past and to confront the potential means to confront the dragon of the past. And of course that's terrifying. And 17 seriously be terrifying. So for example, maybe you're vague and ill formed an ill defined because you were abused very badly when you were a child. Four years old. Something like that, and maybe you were abused by a family member because that's generally who does the music and so that just makes it worse, and then what that means is that you've got a implicit. You had an implicit encountered with malevolent evil that no, you've had a direct encounter with malevolent evil, but you have an implicit hypothesis of malevolent evil that's plaguing you. It's still there.

Speaker 1:          03:22          It's trapped in the memories, right? It's trapped in the representational structure and as an adult you're now faced with the necessity of articulating that fully before you have any chance whatsoever of freeing yourself from it. And so that's no joke. Lots of times people have to go into the past. That's what the psychoanalysts do and say, look, here's something came along and just bloody well knocked me over and it isn't even that I repressed it, which, which I think was, well, we won't talk about Freud's errors because freud was a genius, so we'll just leave him alone. But, but sometimes it's not repression. It's just the terrible things happen to people at such a young age that there isn't a bloody chance in hell that they can figure out why they happened or what to do with them or what they mean, and then you can carry that with you and you carry it with you.

Speaker 1:          04:06          It's like fear your. Your body encounters the world in stages and it happens very rapidly. Well, it can extend over years, but the initial stages happened very rapidly. So for example, if you're walking down the road and you hear a large noise be a loud noise behind you, he'll go like this. That's a Predator defense response by the way you crouched down and that's to stop something from jumping on your back and getting out your neck too easily. That's like a few, a few hundred milliseconds. It's really faster, even faster than that and it better be because something like a snake, but we'll say, can nail you just right now so you better be fast, but it's low resolution. It's like dangerous snake, something like that or danger, predatory cap. It's that faxed and then you can unravel that and categorize it, but that takes time. You do that with emotion and then you do it with cognition and you can do that with longterm thinking, you know, because maybe you've encountered someone specifically malevolent and predatory at work and it happens to people a lot who was operating as a, as a destructive bully and who seems to have no positive function whatsoever and he's the only living that out and then you know, you don't know what to do about it.

Speaker 1:          05:15          So you're, you're in prey mode. I don't mean this kind of mode, although that would help too, but I mean you're acting like a prey animal and then you have this terribly complex thing to decompose, which is what the hell is up with this person? Why are they making my life miserable? What is it about B that allows them to make my life miserable? That's a nasty little road to walk down and you're stuck with having to. You're stuck with having to decompose it. Maybe you can't. Maybe formulating and explicit philosophy of good and evil to deal with something malevolent in your environment actually just happens to be beyond you and that could easily be. It's certainly the case for people who are young and it's the case for plenty of adults as well. It's no simple thing to matt to manage. It's something too that often soldiers who have posttraumatic stress disorder have to do because they've encountered terrible things.

Speaker 1:          06:06          They've either done them or read into them and they need to update their moral model of the world or if they end up in something close closely approximating hell anyway, so you need to know where you are. That's this. What is. Where are you? So you're navigating your navigator. You're a sailor on an ocean, man. That's what. That's what you are. You're a mobile creature. You're going from point a to point b all the time. You're not sitting there glued to a rock like some brainless, you know, sea creature. There's a funny little creature called a hydra. Very simple little creature needs juvenile stage. It has a brain because it swings around, but then when it turns into an adult, it latches itself to Iraq and promptly digests it's brain because if you're just sitting on a rock and you're not moving, you don't need a brain.

Speaker 1:          06:53          So, but that's not our issue, right? We're zipping around in the world and so we're navigating agents. So to navigate, there's two things you need to know and the first is where the hell are you? Exactly. Precisely right. Razor sharp. What's good about you and what's bad about you buy your own buyer own reckoning. You don't have to. You can ask other people, but this is a game you play yourself. It's like as far as I'm concerned, I'm taking star. What is it that's okay about being what needs some work and you got to watch to not be too self critical when you're doing that too, because that can just be another kind of flaw.
