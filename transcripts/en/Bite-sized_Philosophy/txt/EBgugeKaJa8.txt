Speaker 1:          00:00          Hi Dr Peterson, my question is, I know you stated in the last lecture that the importance for setting aims in life and uh, to kind of have goals, goals to work towards. Right? So my question was, um, what, where do you, how do you do that if you don't know where you want to go because that's kind of where I got stuck on your, your future off authoring program because.

Speaker 2:          00:27          Okay, that's, that's a good question. That's a really good question. Um, I think it's echoed to some degree in the structure of the biblical stories and in this manner. So there's this notion in the Old Testament that morality is following a sequence of prohibitions. There's a bunch of bad things you shouldn't do and then basically you're good enough and, and, and I think there's wisdom in that. I think that's kind of where children start, right? You, I mean, I love children and all that, but they're there, they're crazy little creatures and they need to be civilized. And partly what you do is you lay prohibitions on them and mostly what you're trying to do is lay prohibitions on them for the behaviors that if they manifested, would make their life miserable. So I have another chapter in this book that I'm writing called don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.

Speaker 2:          01:21          And the idea there is that your job as a parent is to help your children become the sort of four year olds that adults genuinely smile out when they come into a room because that makes the entire social environment both truthful and welcoming. And so your job is to make them desirable. Social beings and lot of that is prohibition. Okay? There's this ethical transformation and it happens to some degree in the, in the tradition of the. In the prophetic tradition where there's a spirit that seems in some sense to rise above the law, but there's a real transformation between the old testament and the new testament. The Old Testament is prohibition and the New Testament is, well, here's the good things you do once you're more than merely prohibiting yourself from, from impulsive sin. Let's say there's a positive good to be accomplished. While you might say, well, I don't know what the positive good is.

Speaker 2:          02:15          Fair enough, man. So, so this is why this thing that I've said to people, it's become this crazy Internet meme, but that's to clean up your room and which, which is a lot better and more useful than people think. It's a lot harder to. But the thing, the first thing you do, I think, and I learned this in part from Solzhenitsyn when he was trying to iron out his soul when he was in the Gulag because he was trying to figure out how we got there, how he contributed to how we got there. You know, not Stalin and Hitler even though they were kind of to blame, you know, but he wasn't much he could do about that. I think what you have to do, and this is part of humility, is you have to look around you within your sphere of influence, like the direct sphere of influence and fix the things that announced themselves as in need of repair.

Speaker 2:          02:59          And those are often small things you know and they can be like your room, put it in order because the thing is, it isn't exactly so important that your room is an order, although it is. What's important is that you learn how to distinguish between chaos and order and to be able to act in a manner that produces order. And in most households there's 100 things that could be done to just make it less hideous and horrible. And so practicing that is a real useful form of meditation. And it's also, it's also, I think it's a divine act because you're taking chaos and you know, if you pay attention even to a room, it's so interesting. And I learned because I've, I've renovated many places now and tried to make them beautiful. And one of the things that I've really learned is that even if you own a structure, unless you investigated all the nooks and crannies and cleaned them up and put your own imprint on them and made the mirrors, they're not yours.

Speaker 2:          03:54          The mere fact of physical ownership doesn't make them yours. You have to establish a dynamic relationship with the objects before they're actually years and I think you can. You can do something as simple as just sit on your bed and think, okay, there's probably like five things I could do today so that tomorrow morning is slightly better than this morning was at least, or at least I'm not falling behind. And those will usually be like heavy data toad in the morning. Right? It's like, it's not going to be something you want to do. There'll be things you're trying to avoid. There are snakes essentially, but if you ask yourself like you're asking someone, which I think is a form of prayer, if you ask yourself, instead of telling yourself, you know, what is it that I could do to set things more right today that I would actually do?

Speaker 2:          04:40          It's usually some small thing because you're not that disciplined, you know? Then you can go do it and then you put the world together a little more. When you do that and that spreads out, but you also put your. You also construct yourself into something that's better able to call order forth from chaos, and that makes you just incrementally stronger and then the next day you can maybe take on a slightly larger task and like you get the benefit of compound interest. If you do that, it's a tremendously powerful technique and they think if you do that at some point, instead of just having to fix things up that are not good, you'll start to get a glimmer of the positive things that you could do. You know, the positive things that you could do that would actually constitute a vision and that that's what I would recommend. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          05:33          Good night. You.
