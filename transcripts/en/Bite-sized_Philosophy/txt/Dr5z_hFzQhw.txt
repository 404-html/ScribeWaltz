Speaker 1:          00:00          It's because the bloody intellectual leftists have never apologized for their complicity in the catastrophes of the 20th century. The Germans apologized. Sorry about the Nazis. Well, the left wing intellectuals, they say, well, well, that was real. That wasn't real Marxism. It's like, oh, okay. How many carbs does have to pile up around you before you're willing to question your beloved ideological presuppositions and face your resentment and your narcissism and your desire for destruction. You don't like people anyways. The planet has too many of them, so like a nice warm. I cleared out. Well then all the plants can grow again. You know the club of Rome, when they talked about the population explosion that was going to wipe out the planet by the year 2000, they say outright that human beings are a cancer on the planet. Lots of people think that. It's like, oh boy, next put the atom bomb a phone in your hands.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Human beings are a cancer on the planet. What a hell of a thing to say? You're saying that to a four year old. I saw bloody professor at Queen's University. Tell a whole room full of 18 year olds that if they had an ethical fiber in their body, they wouldn't have any kids or they only have one because all they're doing is going out there and raping the planet. It's like, what? You know, what the hell? What? I don't understand that. It's like human beings are hard on the planet, but it's pretty damn hard on us in return. You know? It's like we're just sort of trying not to die to miserably and we make a bit of a mess. Well, doing it. It's like, yeah, Chris, we've only known for 50 years that we were disrupting the oceans. How fast do you think we can learn in 100 years ago, Thomas Huxley, who was a great biologist, said, the oceans are so plentiful.

Speaker 1:          01:45          It was not a chance we could ever put a dent in them. So there's only 100 years ago. Fifty years ago we thought, Oh man, there's more of us and we're better at this than we thought. So like, okay, how fast do you expect people to learn? You know, one generation, one year, we're trying to do our best. Most. Most people are trying to do their best and some people are trying to do their worst, but most people are trying to do their best and so we should have a little compassion, a little sympathy for human beings instead of considering ourselves like raping patriarchal, oppressive destroyers of the world. She's this.
