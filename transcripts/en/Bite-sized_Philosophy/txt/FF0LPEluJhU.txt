Speaker 1:          00:00          So anyways, Pinocchio doesn't know any better and he's got the egotism of youth and he's offered the easy way to success, which is exactly what the Fox tells them and off they go to see Stromboli. So this is the song, I'm not going to read it all. It's great to be a celebrity and actor's life for me. Um, you sleep till after to you promenade a big cigar, you tour the world in a private car, you dine on chicken and caviar and actor's life for me. So it's all this idea of, of wealth and public exposure and zero attention whatsoever to anything regarding responsibility or discipline or learning. And so it's a dual attraction, right? You get everything we want and you don't have to do anything. Jesus. What a deal. And so that's what the act or represents. It's, it's a liar. Fundamentally, it's someone who's acting out a, a deception there, a persona in the union sense.

Speaker 1:          00:58          So the persona is the mask you wear in public that you might even think you are, but you're not. It's this mask and that's the, that's the persona. So the Fox and the cat, or inviting the puppet to only become a persona and and that's, that's see for you, you start as a persona and then when you start to investigate the parts of you that don't really fit in that persona, that would be the shadow. Then you start understanding who you really are and that's shocking because the persona contains everything roughly speaking that you think is good. It may be even that your immediate culture thinks is good and then the shadow contains everything that's not part of that and some of that's really bad, but some of it is good, disguised as bad, and you can't break out of the persona and transcended until you incorporate a lot of what's in the shadow.

Speaker 1:          01:52          And so for example, if you're an extraordinarily compassionate person, let's say 98th percentile will say you're going to be sacrificing yourself to other people all the time and there are people who will find that extraordinarily endearing and it will be under some circumstances. But the problem is is that you will sacrifice yourself and that's a really bad attitude to have. For example, towards adult males. It's a great thing for infants, but for adult males is the wrong approach, and so you will get taken advantage of continually by people who are looking for someone like you until you grow some teeth and you'll think, no, no. That's the opposite of compassion. Being able to bite hard is the opposite of compassion, which it is, and so you'll have that pushed into the predatory category. I'm not doing that. I'm not getting angry. I don't like conflict.

Speaker 1:          02:42          It's like until you bring that out of the depths and put it on so you can use it, you're going to be in trouble and that's kind of niches, idea of the reevaluation of good and evil, right? You have a sense of what's good in a sense of what isn't with your conscience, but it's not very smart. It's got things in the wrong boxes and a lot of the things that even nature itself, a lot of the things that you accept as untrammeled goods like compassion, let's say have a very dark side, first of all, and second are not enough to get you through life. You need the opposite virtues to and so you have to develop them and so you get outside the persona to do that, but anyways, Pinocchio was invited to be a false persona, to take the gains of celebrity without having to do anything to be educated.

Speaker 1:          03:31          He's just gonna go right to the top from right where he is and you know people are kind of fascinated by that idea. That's why you watch America's got talent or the x factor which your shows I actually love. By the way you, you. You never see narcissism in its pure forms. Then you see it when you watch people who display an absolute lack of talent and become homicidal. When someone dares pointed out, right, accusatory and homicidal, instantly it's, it's really something, and then now and then you do see one of these people who's so introverted and so out of society and have this unbelievable gift, which is also something really remarkable to see and it's no wonder those things are so popular. They're psychologically extraordinarily interesting.
