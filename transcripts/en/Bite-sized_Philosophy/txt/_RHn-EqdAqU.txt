Speaker 1:          00:00          Well, I can tell, I can tell you these attempts to shut people down or being made because you need to know this, so as far as I've been able to determine, this kind of protest is an expression of a philosophy that's grounded partly in postmodernism, partly in Marxism. The postmodern element is basically this. There is no such genuine individual identity group identity and you liked it or not only have the interests of your group and the whole world is nothing but a battle ground between groups of different interests. There's no dialogue, there's no possibility of parking between the groups. It's just a power stage where combat has to take place and so the reason that speakers with whom the radical postmodernists tend the is to degree or denied a passport because those people do not believe from the philosophical position. The dialogue can bring consensus and all that's left if you forgo that particular principle is, and this is only where it starts, you know the fuck is that, that you're all pretty damn civilized and thank God for that. Because if there were enough fools in the crowd, especially those who are intent on violence, this would turn out very differently. We do not want to go down that pathway. It's a big mistake. We've been down that pathway many, many times.

Speaker 1:          01:43          I would certainly not conforming to a consensus that was against my belief merely because it was a consensus in the group is wrong. The question was, if there was a consensus against my beliefs, what are your goals with them? And answer would be, well, first it would depend on what my conscience said. What are we going to do? Assume that the consensus is correct. The Nazis had a consensus, right? The end of it. Joel has a conscience and you have to know when the group is made a mistake. In which case what's the maximum?

Speaker 2:          02:35          Talked a lot in your personality closet, very confronting your shadow and generating your shadow. Um, do you find that people who care less about what other people think and care more about their conscience have integrated their shadow maybe more than people who care more about others?

Speaker 1:          02:53          Can you hear me at all? You got a question, the question was stabbing from my personality class are willing to abide by. There are those who've been to braided their shadow and I would say yes, because you have to be a bit of a monster to stand up to the crowd, right? If you're too concerned with people like you and if you're to avoid conflict, then you're going to cave to pressure and you don't want to do that because if you let people stop you from moving forward, you just end up being something and if you're someone who's got no life in you and that's no good for you have to get tough, but you have to give tough in a way that's controlled, right? It has to be controlled because otherwise you're the puppet of your worst impulses and that's a terrible thing to be.
