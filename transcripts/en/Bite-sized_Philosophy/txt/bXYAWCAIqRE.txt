Speaker 1:          00:00          Yes,

Speaker 2:          00:01          you if you can elaborate a bit on, you mentioned you talked about this mental process where people do the thing that's hard but less, less hard, but still basically shadow. That's actually a really productive way of procrastinating, although it comes with its own problems of rationalization, so reinforces certain circuit. I'll put it in a way that says that those can go away, so you need to bring up the. The other inhibitory circuits. Just wondering if you could elaborate. Well, I can sure is in the realm of possibility around their understanding that. Well, I've derived out partly from my study of addiction and also from my study of

Speaker 1:          00:46          recovery from posttraumatic stress disorder, but let's talk about addiction. So there's a series of actions that occur before you take your cocaine. Some of those are local. They are the things that happened immediately before and some of those are distal. They're farther back in the chain of events and when you. When you have a hit of cocaine, it produces a dopaminergic burst and that feels really good, but it also makes the circuits that were immediately active before that grow. That's what reinforcement is, and then the growth is proportionate, not linearly, but it's proportionate to how long before that event occurred. The closer it is, the stronger they're going to get, but even the ones that are somewhat distal get some reinforcement because you might say, well, what did you do before you, you found your latest fix? And the answer is, well, how long before?

Speaker 1:          01:40          Well, the closer, the more reward. And so what happens then is that, so if you take that person out of the normal environment, you put them into a treatment center, they're off. They're a physical addiction, which is a weird thing in the case of cocaine, but I'm like not that long a week. I'll do it two weeks for sure. Even heroin and alcohol for sure, if you can get them through the seizure part without dying. Um, and so they're done. They're physiologically dependent anymore. But you let that person go. And the first thing that happens is his old friend who he's always out doing drugs with shows up and bang, he's craving like mad. And that's because that thing is in an area is not dead at all and it's activated by the queue and it's, it's a circuit. It's not. It's a personality. It only wants one thing at once.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Cocaine, it's going to suppress any non related thoughts and it'll use lies. That's no problem. Especially if lies have been reinforced, which they certainly have. Where are you off to sun, you know you'll have a live for that and then 10 minutes later you have your drug and so that little lie has just grown. Or maybe you think you've tried to quit. You think to hell with it. And every time, 10 minutes before you take your drug, you think to hell with it. And you do that a thousand times. Well believe me that to hell with it, circuit, that sucker is strong. And so it's alive and it's not like it just disappears. It can't, it's you, it's grown in there. Now you can build another circuit to shut it down and you can help decompose across time by not giving it what it wants, but you're going to have to not give it what it wants in all of the multiple contexts that you've already associated with the drug.

Speaker 1:          03:27          Some of you probably smoked and then tried to quit smoking and what you'll see is you get a craving when, well, when you have a cup of coffee or when you're finished dinner, when you're done having a phone call or when you first get up in the morning or whenever you've regularly had the drug, whatever you had the drug in relationship to even complex things like ending a conversation will produce a cute craving and so then that can extinguish overtime if you punish it by either punishing it or not letting it get what it's wants, but a lot you have to build another circuit to just shut it down and then that circuits kind of fragile and stress can often disrupt it. So

Speaker 2:          04:03          that can be read about quitting smoking or things like,

Speaker 1:          04:09          oh sure. Well, part of it. Well, I begins a whole different thing because it seems to have a direct physiological effect, but you know, the, the, the addiction has a cognitive component. It's full of thoughts and desires and wants and you know, you may have to build, you have, may have to rebuild your whole personality in order to, to get that thing cornered. Religious conversion for example, is in a really effective treatment for alcoholism. That's partly why alcoholic alcoholics anonymous works for the people for whom it does work, but religious conversion, which is total personality conversion is actually one of the few things that we know of that's an effective treatment for alcoholism. We don't know how to induce it, but although that's not exactly true either because I'm in the early work with Lsd was lsd was quite promising as a treatment for, for an alcohol addiction and there's recent work with silicide button's showing that if you, if people have a mystical experience when you give them Psilocybin, their success rate and quitting smoking is about 80 percent, which is way higher than any pharmacological intervention for smoking has ever beat. So. Alright. We should probably call it a day, so we'll see you in a week.
