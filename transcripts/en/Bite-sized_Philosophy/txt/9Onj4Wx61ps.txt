Speaker 1:          00:00          And then when the Marxist say, well, that wasn't real Marxism, what it really means, and I've thought about this for a long time, it's the most arrogant possible statement anyone could ever make. It means if I would have been in Stalin's position, I would have ushered in the damn utopia instead that instead of the genocidal massacres, because I understand the doctrine of Marxism and everything about me is good. It's like, well, think again sunshine. You don't understand it, you don't understand it and you're not that good. And if the power was in your hands, assuming you had the competence, which you don't, you wouldn't have done any better. And even if you had, there would have been someone else waiting right behind you to shoot you the first time you actually tried to do anything good. And that's what happened to all the old guard who ran the damn revolution. Stalin rounded them all up and shot them along with their families and millions of other people. So even if you do happen to be that Avatar of moral purity that you claim implicitly, the probability that you get to act out your goodness in relationship to those possessed by Your radiology is zero.
