Speaker 1:          00:00          Elegance is an interesting concept. It's very controversial. In fact, if you, one of the things that continually happens over and over again in psychology is that psychologists discover all sorts of new kinds of intelligence and you know, the biggest two proponents of that sort of thing. I suppose we're Bob Sternberg who came up with this thing equaled practical intelligence. And then Howard Gardner who came up with the theory of multiple intelligences which had a very large effect on educational psychology, um, when the theory was first proposed. And that's not saying much because generally speaking, it's very difficult to find a discipline that's more susceptible to fads than educational psychology. And as far as I can tell, generally speaking, each fat is worse than the previous one. So, you know, Gardner positive that I think there were seven. Oh, there they are, seven or eight different intelligence, linguistic, musical, logical, mathematical, spacial body, kinesthetic, intrapersonal and interpersonal.

Speaker 1:          01:05          And people talk about emotional intelligence and they talk about practical intelligence. And as far as I'm concerned, all of that is complete rubbish. And there's technical reasons for that. I mean there's technical and philosophical reasons for that. The first thing is you can't just mess up a word, you know, the whole point of having a word is so that it defined some things that described some things and doesn't describe other things. Right, and so you can. You can make the word intelligence a current for whatever you want, so you can say that the ability to dance as a form of intelligence, but the problem with that is you blur out the word so badly. You can't tell what it means anymore. And so, and I would also point out we had perfectly good words for those major intelligence as we called them talents and so it's perfectly reasonable to make a distinction between the talent and intelligence.

Speaker 1:          01:58          Now you might say, well, how the hell do you know the difference? Like if if things look similar to some degree, then how do you know if they're the same or different? Well, that's exactly what you do when you do the construct validity process. So let's say you rated a number of people on their dancing ability and then you rated the number of people on their ability to multiply two digit, two, two digit numbers in their head quickly while then you see, technically if both of those were intelligences, then the people who could dance better could multiply two digit numbers faster in their head and that they would be slightly positive story. See, that's what happens when I don't have any diet coke. So anyways, if intelligence was the right word to subsume both of those, then what you see is that would be a high correlation that people who are good dancers would also be the ones who could multiply most rapidly. And I mean multiply in their head, um, but that, but you're not going to be able to extract out a single factor like that. It's just not, it's just not the case that those things associate like that. So for something to be one phenomena,

Speaker 1:          03:22          the things that it. Obviously I've talked too much this semester, all the things that are subsumed under that definition have to be correlated and highly correlated because otherwise they're not the same thing. It's the definition of the same thing. Now, Iq is a very peculiar construct, a very unique construct from a psychological perspective, but also more generally from a social science perspective because Iq has the most predictive validity of anything ever discovered in the social sciences period.
