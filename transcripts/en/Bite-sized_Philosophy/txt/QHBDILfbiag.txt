Speaker 1:          00:02          What I like about this, you see the fact that the, the, the culture of the patriarchy, God, the father will say here is, is holding the suffering individual in his arms and that's encapsulated by nature. It's, it's very much like the story in Pinocchio where Japan Know Pinocchio wasn't able to go down into the depths to confront the terrible monster at the bottom of being without having support from his father. Even though his father ended up trapped inside the whale. If he wouldn't have been supported to begin with, he wouldn't have been able to do it. And you know, I've really seen this. I've really seen this in people. It's a hell of a thing not to have the confidence of your father. It's really, really hard on people. You know, if your father is someone who says to you, you can do it, I really believe that you can do it.

Speaker 1:          00:47          I'll support you in what you're doing. I think that you can sort it out and then acts towards you in that way. That's a gift that really almost no one else can provide you with mothers obviously provide. I think they provide the same kind of gift, but earlier, you know, because the mother has to take care of the infant when the infant is just completely dependent and so, and this is Erickson's idea to Eric Erickson is the mother is, is the person who establishes the relationship that allows the developing person to manifest trust, real truck while you're being carried for crying out loud, you know you can be dropped and the mother is also the source of food, but the father seems to be something like the and I'm being. I'm obviously parsing these things farther apart than they can be need to be because the father can play a nurturing role in the mother complaining, encouraging role, but we'll, we'll keep it simple for now.

Speaker 1:          01:34          The father seems to be the thing that supports and encourages and says, well, yeah, you know, you're little and small and all of that and you're subject to destruction and and, and bullying and social pressure and all that. But I know you can do it. I know you can do it and there's a force in that that's unbelievable. And people who don't have that half a have a hell of a time. It's actually one of the things that's quite fun about doing psychotherapy because you get people who have damaged father figures. It's harder with a damaged mother figure a because it's so bloody deep. You know? I had a client who I just, I just thought she was a remarkable person, but her relationship with her mother was really disrupted. It was really, really hard to. She said she would. She. She told me it was like something had been torn out of her at an early age that couldn't be replaced.

Speaker 1:          02:17          It's ray because you just can't be someone's mother, you know, it's really hard. You're just not there enough for that. But you can sort of be someone surrogate father that's a, that's a role you can play later. And that's what educators do at least to some degree, although now they're trying to be mothers and providing safe spaces and all of that, which is not really all that appropriate. So that. So the father is an encouraging figure and allows the individual, at least in principle, to support the catastrophe of being voluntarily and so anyways, so those, you know, those images, they're just be a brilliant beyond belief. Absolutely brilliant. Beyond belief.
