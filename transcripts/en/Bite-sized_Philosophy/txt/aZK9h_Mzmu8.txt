Speaker 1:          00:00          No, I think the idea of white privilege is absolutely reprehensible and it's not because white people aren't, you know, we have all sorts of privileges and most people have privileges of all sorts and you should be grateful for your privileges and work to deserve them, I would say. But the idea that you can target an ethnic group with a collective crime regardless of the specific innocence or guilt of the constituent elements of that group, there is absolutely nothing that's more racist than that. It's absolutely a boring. I can't

Speaker 2:          00:32          thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:39          If you, if you really want to know more about that sort of thing, you should read about the Kulaks in the Soviet Union in the 19 twenties, k, u l a, k s because they were. They were farmers who were very productive. They were the most productive element of the agricultural strata in, in Russia. And they were virtually all killed or raped and robbed by the collectivists who insisted that because they showed signs of wealth, they were criminals. And, and, and, and, and, and Roberts. So, and the one of the consequences of the prosecution of the Kulaks was the death of 6 million Ukrainians from a famine in the 19 thirties. The idea of collectively held guilt at the level of the individual as a legal or philosophical principle is dangerous. It's precisely this sort of danger that people who are really looking for trouble would push. So and, and just a cursory glance at 20th century history should teach anyone who wants to know exactly how, how unacceptable that is.
