Speaker 1:          00:00          The people turning out in vast numbers, every one of your talks in Australia been oversubscribed massively. It tells you that they kind of get those mortar, this being told, well, it's one of the things that's so interesting about dealing with archetipal themes, you know, archetypal themes or archetipal because they actually speak of the structure of human experience. That's why they last, and so it's human nature and human experience has a pattern. You don't have the capacity to articulate that pattern as an individual in part because your life is too short. You just can't figure it out. But the, the ancient representations of those patterns are everywhere around you. And you know, some of them at the image you caught onto them automatically, you, you, you fall into them. If you go to a movie, for example, because movies always express archetipal themes. If you hear them articulate it, you think, I, I knew that.

Speaker 1:          00:54          I knew that. I just don't know how to say it. That's, that's the platonic idea of, of, um, of, of learning as remembering your soul already knows, but it doesn't have the words. And so when people talk to me about watching my lectures, let's say they say they basically say one of two things, if, if it's. If it's not just a simple thank you. They say one of two things. A third of them say, quarter of them say, when I listened to you talk, it's as if you're telling me things that I already know. It's like, yeah, well that's exactly right, because that's what archetypal stories are there. The description of what you already know, but that can be articulated. And then who you are and how you see yourself and the way you described yourself all become the same thing. So that's wonderful. Then you're not at odds with yourself, you know, and then you have.

Speaker 1:          01:43          Then you're a functioning unity and that makes you much stronger and more indomitable than you would otherwise be. And then the other thing that people say, and this is more like three quarters of them, is that they say, I was in a very dark place. I was addicted. I was, I was drinking too much. I had a fragment, did relationship with my fiance and I wasn't getting married. Things weren't going very well with my family. My relationship with my father was damaged. I didn't have any ame. I was wasting my time. Some variant of that, some combination of those and they say, well, I've been watching your lectures. I've decided to establish a purpose. I'm trying to tell the truth and things are way better and I've. And so let's say I've done maybe eight or nine large scale public talks in the last two months, so that's probably 20,000 people and about half of them, a third to half of them estate afterwards to talk to me, so that's about 7,000 people who have said that to me and then people stop me on the street all the time and tell me exactly that story, which is just wonderful.

Speaker 1:          02:43          You can't imagine how good it is to be able to go to places you've never been and to have people stop people in the streets spontaneously and say, look, my life is way better than it was. It's like it's so good and so, and I've got like, I don't know, 35,000 letters from people since last August. It's more than that. I can't keep track of them, and it's exactly the same thing, like three court, a quarter of them say, well, you've given me the words to say what I already knew was true, and thank you for that. I can see that in the audience. It's so interesting because I can lay out a story. People go like this and say they're doing that all the time. It's like the lights are going on and that's a really wild. There's almost nothing better than that to watch lights go on when you're talking to people.

Speaker 1:          03:22          It's like, that's just absolutely fantastic. But to get this response from people. My father, I have, my father's about 80, 80 is 83, I think 81. He's 81. And uh, I put him in charge of going through my viewer email, which is an overwhelming job. But now we've had discussions about this constantly. He's overwhelmed by the fact that so many people are writing and saying the same thing. It's like, well, I have a purpose, man. My life actually matters. I finally realized that and I'm putting it into practice and I'm bearing up under the heaviest load I can imagine and it's really helping. It's like God and that's tens of thousands of responses now, so it's. It's you couldn't hope for anything better than that. There's zero harm in it, right? It's just people putting their lives together, they're not mucking about with other people and are trying to make broad scale.

Speaker 1:          04:18          Social transformation is about which they have no idea. They're trying to make their immediate environment better and it's working. It's like great. Great. You say the zero harm in, I'd say as a former legislator, that there's an enormous amount of good in a country is only the sum total of the people that make it up to the extent that they put together resilient contribute, don't have to ask others to help them. The stronger the nation, the society and rapidly like. I mean, I think I was thinking the other day, some a journalist asked me why the audience by people are responding so positively to what I'm saying. The young men for example, and I thought, hmm, why? Why? Yeah. That's a good question. Says, well, I'm actually on their side. I'm pretty happy that I'm really happy that they're not wasting their lives. I'm really sad to see that people are disenchanted and nihilistic and depressed and anxious and aimless and, and perverse and vengeful and, and all of those things. It's terrible. And then to see people question whether that's necessary and then to start to rise out of that. It's like, it's so fun. Like last night I was at after my talk, so overwhelming.

Speaker 1:          05:33          I don't usually think about these things, but I was, I was after my talk last night and so all these people line up and you know, they have their 15, 15 seconds with me and they're kind of tentative. They're excited and attentive when they come up to talk to me and then they have, you know, 15 seconds of time to tell me something. I'm really listening to them and they're hesitant about whether or not to share the good news about their life. You know? And I think it's often because when share good news about their life, people don't necessarily respond positively. You know, they don't give encouragement and people need so little encouragement. It's just unbelievable. And so they're telling me something good and I think, God, it's so good. You know, somebody says, oh, I'm getting along better with my father. I haven't seen him for 10 years and now we get along great. And that, the power of that, you can't overstate the power of that for individuals to get their life together. They individuals and unbelievably powerful force and every single person who gets their act together a little bit has the capacity to spread that around them. It's, it's a chain reaction and so it's a lovely thing to see and that's fantastic.
