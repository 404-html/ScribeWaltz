Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay, well so, so that that's another issue in some sense that seems to make the postmodernist critique even more correct. How in the world and going to extract out and canonical interpretation of something like that. It's like it's not possible, but here's the issue as far as I can tell the interpreter, so in the postmodernists extended that critique to the world, they said, look, well, a text is complicated enough. You can extract out a canonical interpretation. What about the world? The world is way more complicated than a text and so there's an infinite number of ways that you can look at the world and so how do we know that any one way is better than any other way? And that's a good question. Now the postmodern answer was we can't and that's not a good answer because you drowned in chaos under those circumstances, right? You can't make sense of anything and that's not good because

Speaker 1:          00:53          it's not neutral to not make sense of things. It's very anxiety provoking. It's very depressing because if things are so chaotic that you can't get a handle on them, your body defaults into emergency preparation mode and your heart rate goes up and your immune system stops working and like you burn yourself out, you age rapidly because you're surrounded by nothing you can control. It's varying. That's an existential crisis, right? It's anxiety provoking in depressing, very hard on people and even more than that, it turns out that the way that we're constructed neurophysiologically is that we don't experience any positive emotion unless we have an aim

Speaker 1:          01:32          and we can see ourselves progressing towards that aim. It isn't precisely attaining the aim that makes us happy. As you all know, if you've ever attained anything because soon as you attain it, then the whole little game ends and you have to come up with another game, right? So it's sisyphus and that's okay, but, but it does show that the attainment can't be the thing that drives you because it collapses the game. That's what happens when you graduate from university. It's like you're king of the mountain for one day and then you're like surf at, at, at, at starbucks for the next five years, you know, so, so what happens is that that human beings are weird creatures because we're much more activated by having an aim and moving towards it than we are by attainment. And what that means is you have to have an aim and that means you have to have an interpretation and it also means that the nobler aim, that's one way of thinking about it, the better your life.

Speaker 1:          02:28          And that's a really interesting thing to know because you know, you've heard ever since you were tiny that you should act like a good person and you shouldn't lie, for example, and you might think, well, why the hell should I not like a good person? Why not lie in even a three year old can ask that question because smart, smart kids learn to lie earlier, by the way, and they think, well, why not twist the fabric of reality so that it serves your specific short term needs? I mean, that's a great question. Why not do that? Why Act morally if you can get away with something and it brings you closer to something you want, well why not do it? These are good questions. It's not self evident. Well, it seems to be tied in with what I just mentioned. It's like you destabilize yourself and things become chaotic.

Speaker 1:          03:12          That's not good, and if you don't have a no blame, then you have nothing but but shallow trivial pleasures and they don't sustain you and that's not good because because life is so difficult, so much, it's so much suffering. It's so complex. It ends and everyone dies and it's painful. It's like without a noble aim, how can you withstand any of that? You can't. You become desperate and once you become desperate things go. Things go from bad to worse, very rapidly when you become desperate, and so there's the idea of the noble aim and it's not something. It's something that's necessary. It's the bread that people cannot live without, right? That's not physical bread. It's the noble aim and what is that? Well, it was encapsulated in part in the story of Marduk. That's, that's to pay attention. It's to speak properly, it's to confront chaos, it's to make a better world.

Speaker 1:          04:06          It's something like that and that's enough of a no blame so that you can stand up without, you know, cringing at the very thought of your own existence so that you can do something that's worthwhile to justify your wretched position on the planet. So now there's a literary issue. Is that. So look, you take a text, you can interpret it a variety of ways, but that's not right. This is where the postmodernist went wrong because what you're looking for in a text and in the world for that matter is, is sufficient order and direction. So then we have to think, well, what is sufficient order and direction means well, you don't want to suffer so much that your life is unbearable. Right? That just seems self evident. Pain argues for itself, I think of pain as the fundamental reality because no one disputes it, right?

Speaker 1:          04:59          I mean even if you say that you don't believe in pain, it doesn't help when you're in pain, you still believe in it, right? It's, it's, it's. You can't pry it up with logic and rationality, it just stands forthe as as what the fundament of existence and that's actually quite useful to know. Say, well, you don't want any more of that than is absolutely necessary and I think that's self evident and then you say, wait a minute. It's more complicated than that. You don't want any more of that. That's necessary today, but also not tomorrow and not next week, not next month, not next year, so however you act now better not compromise how you're going to be in a year because that would just be counterproductive. That's part of the problem with short term pleasures, right? It's like active haste, repented leisure. Everyone knows exactly what that means, so you have to act in a way that works now and tomorrow and next week and next month and so forth, and so you have to take your future self into account and human beings can do that and taking your future self into account isn't much different than taking other people into account.

Speaker 1:          06:01          Right? Because I remember there's this Simpson episode and a homer downs, a quart of Manet's and vodka. He says, I'm someone's. Marge says, you know, you shouldn't really do that, and homer says that's a problem for future homer. I share. I'm sure. Glad I'm not that guy.
