Speaker 1:          00:00          People aren't taught that comparing what we have to. They're hypothetical politically, politically, ideologically motivated. Utopia is actually a bad idea, you know, because it's, it just isn't difficult to take a look at a system like our system and say, well, look at all the problems that has compared to a hypothetical system that doesn't have any problems at all. And it's like, well, yeah man, there's problems, there's, you know, we've, we've taken like 99 percent of the fish out of the ocean and, and you know, the degree to which our current level of economic activity is truly sustainable without alteration is at least debatable. Even though I don't think it's nearly as terrible as people make out, make it out to be. But I don't think it's disputable that our current socioeconomic structures are the most productive and the most free structures that have ever been produced by people anywhere in the world.

Speaker 1:          00:55          And one of the things you can say about capitalism and free enterprise and and the western stress on individuality is that even though it does produce inequality, a all systems producing inequality and and without any real distinction between the right and the left by the wayside because I'm so new book called the Great Leveler by Walter Shadelle, who I'm going to be talking to later this month, he did an analysis, empirical analysis trying to figure out if you, if you grouped governments by right wing philosophy say or by left wing philosophy and then you calculated inequality coefficient. Would that left wing organizations be characterized by reduced inequality? And the answer was no. There's no evidence that they are. And what that points to, and this is something very fundamental, it's a far more fundamental than than political, is that inequality is the rule in cooperative slash competitive organizations. You can't positive value without producing a hierarchy, right?

Speaker 1:          01:59          Because you paused, it devalues, say this is worth doing. And everyone says, yeah, this is worth doing well. Then what happens automatically is that it turns out that some people are better at doing it than other people, no matter what it is, and then they'll get better and better at it, like the Credo principle you're talking about too, and then they start getting better at it. So the problem is is that without you with if you're going to positive value, which you have to do, if you're going to act and immediately you create a hierarchy and you also build into the value claim, the claim that a is better than b. You also built into that the idea that if a is better than B, than people who are doing better at a should be differentially rewarded compared to people who who aren't. There's no way around that if you're going to play the game and so you're stuck with inequality, but there isn't any evidence that that social engineering policies are really very good at dispensing with inequality, which is a fundamental political problem and no one really knows what to do about it, but criticizing the entire society.

Speaker 1:          02:57          I mean, the thing about the west, and this is increasingly true all over the world, is that it's generating our approach generates a tremendous amount of wealth for ever. I mean, it even happened in China, you know, despite their exceptionally totalitarian leanings. And so what happens with the lefties is that they say, well, inequality as a consequence of the west and the consequences of capitalism, which is palpably false claim and say, well, because it produces inequality, then it's a corrupt system. It's like, no, every system produces inequality, but hardly any also produce wealth.
