Speaker 1:          00:00          He wrote these books, notebooks that haven't been published yet, called the black books and the black books are the documentation of his experiments with his imagination and what he would do is daydream like, like a child daydreams. He regained that faculty, although I think with you, and it was a faculty that has never really disappeared and he had figures of imagination that came to him that he could speak with and he spoke with these figures of imagination and documented that over a very long period of time. And that was originally. That was eventually distilled into a book called the Red Book, which was published about three or four years ago. And it was a book that young regarded as the central source from which all his inspiration emerged. It was sort of the way it looks to me is that we embody a lot of information in our action.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Right? And our action has developed as a consequence of imitating other people and not only the people or the people around us, but of course the people around us imitated the people who came before them and those people in imitated. The people who came before them and so on so far back that it's as far back as you can go, and so you embody these patterns of behavior that are extremely informative, that you don't understand, that are a consequence of collective invitation across the centuries and throw. Then those patterns can become manifest as figures of the imagination and those failures of imagination are the distillations of patterns of behavior and so as the distillations of patterns of behavior, they have content and it's not you that content. It's you could even think about it as content that's evolved. Although it's culturally transmitted. It's content that's evolved and so these figures of the imagination can reveal the structure of reality to you and that's what happened with young and that's what he described in the red book and that was what permeated his psychology.

Speaker 1:          02:09          Psychology. That was based on the presupposition that the fundamental architectural structures of religious belief. We're not pathological, not deceitful, not protective in some delusional sense against the fear of death, but quite the contrary. The very stories that enabled us to move forward as confident human beings in the face of chaos itself and it's conceivable, I think perhaps probable that nothing more important conceptually happened in the 20th century than that because it was the first time post enlightenment that Ab rapprochement between the intellect and the underlying religious archetipal occurred. You have in the capacious intellect of young and the same thing happened to some degree with piaget. The religious domain and the factual domain were brought back together and the fact of young's enduring and increasing popularity and influence, I would say is a direct consequence of that. Now some of his work was spun off into the new age and the new age is a very optimistic and naive movement.

Speaker 1:          03:32          It's predicated on the idea that you can do nothing say, but follow your bliss and that will take you ever hire to enlightenment. And that's not the union idea at all. The union idea is that what you most need will be found where you least want to look. So there's this story. King Arthur, there's this story of King Arthur the. They're all in round table, right? King Arthur and his knights, they're all equals. They're all super ordinary, but they're all equals and they go off to look for the holy grail from the holy grail. Grail is the container of the redemptive substance, whatever that is might be the cup the Christ used at the last supper might be a cellist that was used to capture his blood on the cross, right when he was pierced by a sword. The stories differ, but that's the holy grail and the holy grail is lost.

Speaker 1:          04:23          That's the redemptive substance and the knights of King Arthur go off to search for the holy grail and but they don't know where to look. So where do you look when you don't know where to look for something you need desperately, but I've lost. Well, each of the nights goes into the forest at the point that looks darkest to him, and that's union psychoanalysis in a nutshell. It's like that which you fear and avoid that which you hold in contempt, that which disgusts you and that you avoid. That's the gateway to what you need to know. There's nothing new agey about that, that's for sure.
