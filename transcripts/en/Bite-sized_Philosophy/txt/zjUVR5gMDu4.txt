Speaker 1:          00:06          I guess passive resistance or nonviolent resistance? No, no, not nonresistance. It's actually. It's one step further than nonviolence. It's like you don't even resist. That's what. That's what tolstoy was talking about. It's from the sermon of the Mount where Christ said, resist not evil. That was like, you don't even resist it. And so I thought that there was a metaphysics to that potential. Yeah. Well then I would say that you, you, you've asked me a question that I can't answer. I mean, I guess that would be in the same line as turned the other cheek. Now that's, that's in a way it's. Yeah, yeah. There's some nuance there. I thought there is. There is because turn the other cheek means don't participate in an escalating cycle of violence and that's reasonable man. That if you can do that, resist not evil. You know when I go into the sermon on the mount, I go into all the individual lines and look up multiple translations and multiple interpretations and try to.

Speaker 1:          01:17          Because sometimes though it's extremely interesting, like for example, when there's a line in the new testament, that's the meek shall inherit the earth. That's not the right translation. Oh really? That is not what that means. That means, and it's Germane to our discussion. That means those who have those who are competent to use force but do not wield it, will inherit the earth. That is a whole different issue. I would like to see exactly what resists not means because my suspicions are that the devil's in the details, but it's definitely a sufficiently jarring an injunction to be worthy of further investigation bit especially because I've heard you talk in the past about how how futile it is to show up somewhere with a placard. That's probably a very expressed version of of how resisting what you deem to be evil. Just the act of resisting it alone is so useless.

Speaker 1:          02:24          It's a waste of energy. Right. Like actual energy. Very interesting. That's a very interesting take on that. So that's why I think it's interesting. You know, because I've been thinking about continuing my whatever you might describe it as struggle, let's say with the the forces that are corrupting the university. I thought for a long time in terms of war metaphors with regards to that and then over the summer when I got a bit of a break and was able to think more clearly or begin to think more clearly about whatever it is I might be doing, I realized that my primary role on youtube and perhaps publicly is not

Speaker 1:          03:07          the leader of a war against the social justice warriors. It's more like think of encouragement and education with that as a side effect, let's say, and maybe even a concern, but if it's a war, then it's the wrong approach. You're, you're stuck is maybe you also dignify your enemy with a war. You actually encode their power, right? Resistance as a waste of time. That's really useful. A waste of energy. It you bet. You Bet. Well, it has all those aspects we discussed. It has the glorification of the enemy as well because it might be far more effective to say that whole thing is, dad, here's a different way.
