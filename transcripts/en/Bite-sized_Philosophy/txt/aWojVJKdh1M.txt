Speaker 1:          00:00          I worked with this crazy psychologist, he, he used to put jokes on is multiple choice tests. He was a really eccentric guy, but I really liked his courses. He and he, he taught a course on creativity and he was also a prison psychologist and he was an eccentric guy and he for some reason liked me and maybe because I was eccentric to and he invited me to go out to the Edmonton maximum security prison with them a couple of times, which I did. And that was a very interesting experience because I was trying to figure out what role each individual's behavior bore to the pathology of the group with something like that. And I went out there and I met with the little guy smaller than me. I was a little bigger by then and he was a pretty innocuous guy. And uh, what had happened was I was out in this gymnasium, it looks like a high school. The prison, which is really quite telling in my estimation, but, and there were all these like monsters in their weightlifting and like they were monsters. I remember one guy who was tattooed everywhere and he had like a huge scar running down the middle of his chest. It looked like someone had to hit them with an ax and you know, and, and I was in there and I had this Weird Cape that I used to wear that I bought in Portugal and some boots that went along with it.

Speaker 1:          01:18          Yeah, it was like an 1890 sherlock Holmes Cape and it was really like, it was from the 18 nineties because this little village was up on a hill. It was a walled city on a hill and they sold these things and I don't think they've changed the style since 1890. And so I thought they were really cool and so I was wearing that, which wasn't perhaps the most conservative garb to dawn if you're going to wear, if you're going to go to a maximum security prison. So anyways, I was in the gymnasium and the psychologist, the psychologist left and God only knows. I mean that's what he was like. And all these guys came around. All these guys came around me, you know, and they were offering to trade their prison clothes for my cape and he was like, I was being made an offer I couldn't refuse, you know, and so I didn't, I didn't really know what to do.

Speaker 1:          02:07          And then this little guy said something like that, the psychologist sent me to come and take you away or something like that. And so I thought, well better this little guy then all these monsters. So we went outside the gym through some doors, like school doors, went outside the gym into the exercise yard I guess, and we're wandering along and he was talking to me and he seemed like a kind of an innocuous guy. And then the psychologist showed up at the door and motioned us back. And so, which was kind of a relief. And so I went into his office and he said, you know, that guy that you walked out in the yard with? And I said, yeah. He said he, uh, he took two cops one night and he had them kneel down and while they were begging for their lives, he shot them both in the back of the head.

Speaker 1:          02:52          And I thought, hmm, that's. See the thing that was so interesting was that he was so innocuous, right? Because what you'd hope is that someone like that would be very much unlike you, let's say, and certainly wouldn't be like somewhat innocuous that you'd met. What you'd want is that the guy would be like half world wolf and half vampire so you could just tell right away that he was a cold blooded killer. But no, he was this sort of ineffectual little guy who was certainly not ineffectual if you gave them a revolver and the upper hand. And so, so that made me think that made me think a lot about the relationship between being innocuous and being dangerous. And then another thing happened. I met another guy out there and then a week or two later I heard that he and a friend of his had held another guy down and pulverized his left leg with a lead pipe, like just pulverized it.

Speaker 1:          03:49          And the reason for that was that they thought that he was a snitch and maybe he was and that that time I did something different and instead of being shocked and horrified by that, although I certainly was, I thought, how in the world could you do that? Because I didn't think I could do that. Hey, I didn't think that. I thought that there was a qualitative distinction between me and those people. And so I spent about two weeks trying to see if I could figure out under what conditions I could do that. Like what kind of psychological transformation I would have to undergo to be able to do that. And so that was a meditative exercise, let's say. And it only took about 10 days for me to realize that not only could I do that, that it would be a hell of a lot easier than I thought it would be.

Speaker 1:          04:33          And that sort of where that wall between me and what you described is the shadow started to fall apart and that also was very useful because I started to. I started to treat myself as somewhat different entity because I hadn't been aware up to that point, you know, because I thought I was a good guy and there's no reason for me to think that because you're not a good guy unless you really made a bloody effort to be a good guy. You're just not. It's not easy and so you're probably a moderately bad guy and that's a long ways from being an absolutely horrible guy, but it's also a long ways from being a good guy. And so. But I had a little more respect for myself after that because I also understood that there was a monstrous element to the human psyche that, that you needed to respect and that was part of you. That you should regard yourself in some sense as a loaded weapon. It's very useful around children to regard yourself as a loaded weapon because around children you are a loaded weapon and the terrible experiences that many children have with their parents are testament to that.
