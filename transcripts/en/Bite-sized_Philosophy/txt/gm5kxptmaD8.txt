Speaker 1:          00:02          And with regards with regards to the universities, I thought at one point that the best thing to do would be to cut their funding by 25 percent, let them fight amongst themselves for the remnants because it would force the universities to decide exactly what's important and what isn't. So I would say the humanities and much of the social sciences have has turned into a postmodern Neil Marxist playground for radicals. The scholarship is terrible. Eighty percent of humanities papers aren't cited once, once. And so what that means is that they write papers for each other and they sell them to libraries and that's how the publishers make their money and no one reads them. But the publishers can print them because the libraries have to buy them and they're buying them with your tax money. And so all of you who are sitting here are funding and postmodern radical neo Marxist agenda that has its roots in the university and your tax money is going towards that. And if you want proof of that, you just go online and look at the websites, especially of of disciplines like women's studies, which has pathological right to the core, but it's not just women's studies, it's all the ethnic studies group

Speaker 2:          01:02          you.

Speaker 1:          01:03          It's anthropology, it's sociology, it's social work, and most of all it's education and noisy. For example, in Ontario is perhaps a part from the Ontario Human Rights Commission, the most dangerous institution in Canada.

Speaker 2:          01:17          Thank you. It should

Speaker 1:          01:21          be defunded. It's as simple as that. They don't do the research they purport to do. They're not interested in it at all. In education. They're interested in the indoctrination of people as young as they can fund a as young as they can get their hands on, so to speak. Now we need to figure out, our society needs to figure out how to stop shunting public tax money to radical left wing activists. If we were doing that for radical right wing activists, there would be an absolute storm, but it's happened incrementally since the 19 sixties and it needs to stop.
