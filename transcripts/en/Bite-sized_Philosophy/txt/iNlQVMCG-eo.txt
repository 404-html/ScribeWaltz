Speaker 1:          00:01          How would you summarize why men are in crisis now? I think it's because it in a deep level, the West has lost faith in the idea of masculinity. Now that's no different than the death of God. It's the same thing and so and need chip knew what the consequences of that would be. I mean that's most of what he wrote about and so you'd say, well, the divine symbol of masculinity has been obliterated. Well, so then what do you expect? What's going to happen? It's going to. That means masculinity is going to become weak, and especially if the symbol is also denigrated, right? Which it definitely is. So what that means is that the ideal that man could aspire to is denigrated, and while then with your ideal in tatters, you're weak. That's, that's definitional. So I think the reason that men have been responding positively to my, my thinking, let's say, is that I don't buy any of that. I like the masculine spirit. It's necessary and it's not fundamentally

Speaker 1:          01:21          carnage and pillaging. It's not fundamentally rape culture. No, it's not fundamentally world destroying and all of those things have been. All of those aspersions have been cast upon it. That's partly the guilt of Western Society for technological progress even, and those are reasonable challenges to be set before men, but they're not reasonable accusations to swallow without criticism. What is a masculinity we can aspire to? Well, it's a responsibility fundamentally and and it's, it's, it's to, to put it symbolically is that your responsibility is to incarnate the spirit of the logos. That's your responsibility. That's your role in life, and that is independent to some degree in whether or not you accept the idea of a transcendent eternal reality. Now I'm not making a case for that or against that I, those things are beyond human understanding, but we know what happens if people act poorly. If men act badly, we know what happens.

Speaker 1:          02:37          We know that the world turns into something that's so close to hell, but the difference is trivial. We know that that's the story of the 20th century, so we should learn that lesson and what that lesson is is pick up the world on your shoulders and walk forward, pick up the world with all of its trouble, with all of it's suffering with all of its evil and move forward with it and in bearing that burden learned that you were that sort of creature that can bear that burden and therefore deserving of respect. That's, that's the, that's identification with the logos and that's. I don't, I've never encountered an idea that's better than that because it's not. It's so not naive. It's the opposite of naive. It's like there's terrible evil and there's terrible suffering. It's a bottomless, but the human spirit is capable of voluntarily taking that on as a challenge. Well, it's worth a try.

Speaker 1:          03:53          Yes, exactly. That's, that's, that's, that's the positive. Meaning. That's the positive meaning. That's the world affirming, meaning you know, and that that's that self esteem, let's say, you know, which is very poorly characterized. It's very shallowly characterized because it usually doesn't involve any sense of responsibility, but you know, it's obvious if you. It's obvious in some ways if you look at the people that other people spontaneously respect, unless they've become unbelievably cynical, it's the people who adopt responsibility and deal with it competently, so it's not a mystery that that would be what you could aspire to. Now it it gets undermined if you feel that that force of responsibility is the raping and pillaging patriarchal culture that's despoiling the natural environment and that's equivalent to a cancer. Well, you know, no, I don't buy that.
