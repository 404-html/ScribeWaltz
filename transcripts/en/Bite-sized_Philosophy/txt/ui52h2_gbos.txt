Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay, well I could talk. Let me talk about the situation at the Ivy League universities. First, the question broadly speaking covers the question about intelligence and about its diverse manifestations and about its role in selection for universities. Could go back and look at the records at Harvard for example, in the early 19 sixties, the typical IQ for a Harvard student was about 100, five to 110, not much above average, but that's because they were finishing schools for the, for the rich, roughly speaking, and you know your. If you had a rich father and he made his money, he was probably well above average in intelligence, but if you are his offspring, there's regression towards the mean, so there's no reason to assume that by nature of your position you are going to be particularly intelligent anyways. The average Ivy League student wasn't, was bright but not outstanding.

Speaker 1:          00:51          So now it's 100 IQ, 145, three standard deviations above the mean because. And the reason for that is because they're selected by the sat scholastic aptitude test. It's an IQ test. They won't say it's an IQ test, but that doesn't matter. It isn't. It's an IQ test. It's a simple as that. Any any test that contains a sufficiently diverse range of problem solving questions that's rank ordered in, in, in accuracy among people is an IQ test. The correlations like point eight, five. So and what has happened. There's two things that have happened. I mean the Ivy Leagues have got more and more selective because they can and so the average IQ of their students is just continued to move upwards and then the average IQ of the population is actually increased to a substantive degree to over the last 50 years. Partly because partly perhaps mostly because of improved nutrition and and information exposure along among the.

Speaker 1:          01:51          Like the more deprived members of the culture. It's better to watch tv than to sit alone in your crib for example, an isolated and people have enough food now. So the really low end of the intelligence spectrum is being truncated and the general population IQ is increased. So with regards to institutions like the University of Toronto, say they average IQ at the University of Toronto with somewhere between 120 130, and we know that because we've tested it and it's not surprising because you're basically selected for cognitive process, right? Because grades are rough. Marker of intelligence. Conscientiousness, by the way also matters independent trait because the best two predictors of university grades are conscientiousness and intelligence, not creativity, by the way, zero correlation with creativity.
