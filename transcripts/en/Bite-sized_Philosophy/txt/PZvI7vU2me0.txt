Speaker 1:          00:00          Ideologies are fragmented, religions are essentially, they use the same symbolic under structured, but they only tell part of the story. I can give you a quick example of that. I'll do it very quickly. So when the American West was settled, it was settled on the. On the wave of an ideological story, and here's the story. Heroic individual that's positive, bringing positive culture. That's the wise king into virgin oriented, chaotic territory. That's the negative mother essentially. So that's positive individual, positive culture, negative nature, right, and that's. That's a motivating story, man. To bring heroically, bring order into the untamed wilderness. It's like a million people a year from Europe. Come driven by that narrative. It's, okay, well here's the counter narrative raping and pillaging individual bringing the desolations of tyrannical culture into the virginal, wonderful environmental. What? What? What would you call it? A hystopia of nature. It's like, yeah man, you can get a long way with that story too, but they're both half the story, so you just put those two things together and you have a religious story.

Speaker 1:          01:07          It's like while the individual is heroic but also is an adversary and accrual adversary at that culture is the wise king, but it's also the evil tyrant and nature is beautiful and wonderful friendship, impressionistic landscape and cancer and anopheles mosquitoes and they elephantiasis and so if you are properly oriented in the world, you tell yourself both those stories and you say, Oh my God, they conflict. It's like, yeah, they do, man. That's exactly right. So an etiology just pulls out a subset of the religious characters and says, this is the entire reality. It's like, no, it's not. It's a parasitical. It's a parasitical meme. Essentially an ideology is a parasitical meme on a religious substructure.
