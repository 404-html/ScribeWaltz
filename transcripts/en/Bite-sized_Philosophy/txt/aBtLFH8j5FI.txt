Speaker 1:          00:00          Being on forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. This is a commentary from Matthew Henry, who is a nonconformist minister and author, cheerful and obliging. Manners in showing kindness are great, ornaments to piety or are condescending. Lord Vouch, safest, not personal visits to us, yet still by his spirit. He stands at the door and knocks. When we are inclined to open, he deigns to enter by his gracious constellations. He provides a rich feast of which we partake with him.

Speaker 1:          00:36          This is from revelations 3:20. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me. Well, the hyperlink nature of those quotes is quite obvious. There's 10 or 15 things being said at the same time, right? One is a reference to the idea that if you ask for something, it will be given to you. Right? It was a very strange idea, but I like that idea a lot and I believe my, in my experience, that has been true. If it was that I wanted what I was asking for because that's the real issue, right, because the question is if you want something, what does it mean to want it and what it means is to sacrifice whatever is necessary to get it because otherwise you don't want it, and so there's an equation here and I'm not claiming it's ultimate accuracy, but the equation is something like you don't want it unless you're willing to sacrifice for it and if you don't want it, you're not going to get it because you're scattered.

Speaker 1:          01:39          But if you do want at any make the proper sacrifices, then God only knows what might happen and that's a c. One of the things I really like about the existential philosophers is their emphasis on personal responsibility. You know that many of them had an emphasis on the role that people had in shaping their own destiny. The exits for the existentialists, and I think this was a consequence of the religious substructure, of, of philosophical thinking. It was self evident that life was tragic and bitter, but and then fair enough, but that isn't where it ended. The next issue was, well, there are better ways, better and worse ways of dealing with that, and the better way of dealing with the fact that life is tragic and better is to

Speaker 1:          02:28          pause it, the self you could be and live authentically in relationship to that and then the next issue and some. This is something kierkegaard talked about, particularly when he talked about the necessity of being a knight of faith, is that the thing is, and this is I think part of the light part of life that's the intractable adventure. No one can take the adventure of life away from you, that they can't do it with good advice, for example, because no one can demonstrate to you that if you straighten out a name at what you want and make the proper sacrifices that your life will turn out in the manner that you might want it to turn out. It isn't in anyone else's purview to make that judgment. The only person that can possibly figure that out is you. It's something that can't be stolen from you.

Speaker 1:          03:16          I would say it's your destiny. It's a destiny that cannot be stolen from you and you can forgo it. You can say, well, I'm not willing to put in the effort because what if I fail? Well, first of all, if you don't put in the effort, you will fail because life is hard and it takes everything out of you to do it properly so you will fail and if you make the proper sacrifices, you might fail. That's why I like the ambiguity and the story of Cain and Abel because we're never really told why God rejects canes offerings. There's hands that came maybe isn't doing as good a job as he should, and he certainly gets bitter about it, but there's no smoking pistol. It doesn't say, well, Cain is a bad guy. He made terrible sacrifices, so god rejected him. You never know. Cain might've been working pretty damn hard and things still didn't work out for them, and I think that ambiguity is appropriate in the story because that ambiguity ambiguity is in life. You'd be. You'd be a fool to say that everything always works out for everyone if they just do things right. I mean, I think that's a very, that's a very careless thing to say, given how much tragedy and catastrophe there is in the world and how much of it seems to be undeserved, but that still has very little bearing I think on, on, on your own individual adventure and the necessity for

Speaker 1:          04:40          the necessity for opening the door to who you could be and, and the necessity to do that. Seriously. And I do believe and I think I, I think that's why this most impossible of versus you know, knock and the door will open. Why that's believable is that I have never met anyone who couldn't hypothesize a better them in some manner.

Speaker 1:          05:07          All they had to do is ask. It's like, well, how could you be better? Thank well here's three ways. It's like, it's no problem, right? You can think about that no time flat. Maybe it's small ways, but you can almost always at least think of something stupid that you're doing that you could quit. And so that means that you do have this. It's a strange thing and people that we have this built in capacity to pause it a higher self and then to move towards it and maybe maybe that's part of where the religious instinct really came from speaking like really reductionistically like as a materialist. As an evolutionary psychologist, we have this notion of the transcendent ideal, right? That that seems to be pervasive across cultures. Well, maybe that's the ultimate manifestation of the human proclivity to be able to pause it an ideal at all and to move forward.

Speaker 1:          05:51          You pause it. An ideal, okay. That you need that to move forward. Well, if you can pause it, an ideal, why can't you pause it? The ultimate ideal? Well, if you can then instantly you've got to religious sensibility instantly and so maybe that's because I've puzzled like as a biologist, what the hell is the basis of the religious instinct because the idea that it's mere superstition, like we can just dispense with that. That's a wrong. It's a human universal. You can evoke religious experiences all sorts of ways, so we're not going to play that game. There's some reason that that instinct exists and this the first thing to do with it is to try to reduce it to something that's biological and leave it at that. Not to mess with the metaphysics, but it certainly could be the case that it's the ultimate extension of our capacity to pause it and ideal and we also might say, well, that's good enough because while the ideal moves you forward, it fills your life with meaning. There's no doubt about that because it is in the movement towards your ideal that life's meaning is to be attained and then the question is, well, how much meaning is there in moving forward towards an ultimate ideal? Well, more meaning, even though it's more difficult. How much? Well, that's the open question.
