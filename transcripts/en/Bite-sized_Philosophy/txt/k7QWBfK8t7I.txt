Speaker 1:          00:00          Number five, do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them. This is sorta been a through line to at least the beginning part of our council. Well, the first thing is it's the monster thing, like the beauty and beast thing. You are not a good guy and you will take revenge on your children if they misbehave. You Think, oh no, I liked my children. It's like other people might not like them. Maybe they don't behave very well, you know, and you think you liked them because you're a saint, but you're not and you will take revenge on those children if they do things that make you dislike them. So you're in the grocery store and you've got a four year old and four year olds, pretty smart checking you out all the time and like poking you and prodding you and seeing what's there because that's what little kids do.

Speaker 1:          00:42          They're not that verbal. So they are, they're, they're like, they, they, they have. You could compare their behavior in some ways to pack animals like dogs, which is why they like dogs and get along with dogs. They understand each other, you know, and so they're testing out and so they have a temper tantrum in the store and you don't know what to do about it. What you do, your kid has a temper tantrum in the store. You pick up the child, you go outside with them, you stand them up somewhere and just let them have it. Let them have the temper tantrum. It's like they don't get sick of it. Soon enough, go somewhere boring and dull. Say, well, have outer man. Then the kids done. You say, we're going to stand right here until you decide that you're going to behave. The child knows what that means is like, you're going to behave or we're just gonna.

Speaker 1:          01:30          Stand here. It's like, fine, okay. You don't do that. The child has a temper tantrum. The third one, you know you're embarrassed. You're turning red. Everyone's sweating. Everyone's looking at you like you're a horrible parent. It's like really unpleasant thing. Oh, I love my child. I liked my child. It's like, no, you don't. That's a lie. You go home, the kids forgotten all about it. You know, they go in their room, they make a little drawing, they're all thrilled that they come out and show it to you and maybe they did a really good job. You know, maybe there are even a little guilty about having the Damn Tantrum, but you, man, you're not happy and you think, yeah, that's nice and you go back to whatever useless thing you're doing and you think I got that little bastard and you think, no, I wouldn't think that.

Speaker 1:          02:10          It's like you're wrong. You're wrong. Not only would you think that you would act it out, and if you don't think that that's true, then you don't know yourself very well and so you got to think. Now a little kid is little and powerless while not as powerless as you might think, but fundamentally you got the upper hand and you've got the proclivity for tyranny deeply rooted in you and so you better be real careful around that child. I, I used to tell my kids, you know, when I was not in a good mood, he say like it would be better if you were in your room and they didn't mind. They knew what it meant, you know, they were very young. They could understand that. It's like you're a fine kid, you know, pat, Pat, Pat, I'm not in a good mood. Things are likely to be unpleasant.

Speaker 1:          02:52          Why don't you just go play in your room for a while. It's like way they went, they knew how to play in their room, you know, because I didn't want them being around me. I wasn't being going to be a good guy. And so in Kim's faith, they know they can handle that man, they can't handle lies, they can handle that sort of truth, no problem. And so like I, both my wife and I, we very careful. It's like when we're starting to not be happy with the kids, with one kid or the other, it was time to have a chat and figure out what it was that had gone off the rails and how we were going to fix it. So that we were like thrilled to have that kid around. And that's the thing about kids is you can be thrilled to have them around. Not always, you're tired, you're hung over like you've had a bad day. The kids cranky. Like I'm not saying this is utopia. It's not. That's not the point. The point is though, you, you can manage your relationship with your kids and you can have an honest relationship with them and then it will be the best relationship with anybody you've ever had in your life.
