Speaker 1:          00:00          So my question to you is a social contract or a legal system replaced religion as moral framework and a way we are?

Speaker 2:          00:10          I think it's because it's because of the gap between what we articulated and what we don't know. Something has to fill that gap. Like I think the law could be, could, could replace it if the law was total, but it isn't. It's bounded and the incorrect and there's something in risks. It has to rest on something inside that's like this mediator between what we articulate, what we don't understand. It's something like customer, something like expectation. It's something like the intrinsic sense of justice, you know that the law itself is aiming at and those aren't fully articulated, but without them there'd be no grounding. Like without the body, the law would be a dictionary, you know? And if you don't know what a word means, using the dictionary is helpful, but not that helpful because like unless you've had the experience of anger, the dictionary, I can't tell you what anger means, it's just refers to other words, but the words themselves refer to something else and the law refers to something else.

Speaker 2:          01:12          And without that it has to be in tune with that something else. It has to be in accordance with it. And so I don't think we can ever delineate the proper body of laws. And that's also why you like ideological utopias. See the ideological utopia is dispensed with the transcendent. They say, this is what we need to do. It's like, no, you don't. No, that's not good. You have to leave space for what you kind of know and for what you don't know. And I mean, you know, in the story of the Tower of Babel, human beings make this massive building. It's supposed to reach up to the heavens so that it'll take the place of God. Well, that's, that's the earliest warning we have of the danger of making things so big that you confuse them with God and God gets irritated and comes down and makes everybody speak different languages and scatters them.

Speaker 2:          02:04          It's like, well, that's what happens when you try to make something a totality is that it starts to fragment inside and disintegrates into catastrophe and so it's, it's almost as if we have to maintain this articulated space inside the dream, inside the custom, something like that, because otherwise it doesn't work. And I think that's the same as having respect for the fact that we have bodies. You know, we're not just abstract creatures that follow rules. We're not that at all. We only follow certain rules. We won't follow the other ones and our societies will crumble. And so, and we just don't know enough to articulate the entire landscape of behavior with articulated rules. Not at all. We can't do it. It's beyond us. Yep. Yep.
