Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, you can't let the orderliness part of you get the upper hand so terribly that it's impossible for you to live. That's what happens to girls who have had [inaudible] by the way. You know how you get. There's this idea with regards to anorexia that it's often high achieving girls who have it and while it's hyper conscientious girls, they get so disgust sensitive. They can't stand their own bodies and so for example, then they start being able to look at their bodies properly and so what they do instead of looking at their whole body, they lose the ability to do that. They only can see parts of their body and then they can't tell the difference between a part that's healthy and well shaped and a fat part and so anything that's that's, that's what would you call of dubious. Anything that's hard to measure becomes impossible to see.

Speaker 1:          00:46          So either an anorexic client at one point, she wasn't a very big woman maybe about this big and thin. Yes, obviously. And so I was trying to work with her on her body perception disorder and one of the things I did was, so I had her come and sit beside me, so I was sitting like this and so is she. And I said, well you look at our two thighs, which one is bigger? Like mine was like 40 percent bigger. And she said, well I can't tell they look the same to me. And so I said, okay, this is what we're going to do. I let her do it. I said, you take a pencil and also done a piece of paper and you just trace my thigh. Okay. And then you can put that piece of paper underneath your thigh and trace it and then you can look at the difference.

Speaker 1:          01:24          Well, so I had her do that and she looked at the two pieces of paper and she couldn't believe it. She could not believe that that was actually the case because her perception had become so disordered that it was impossible for her to see the real shape of her body. And we would go outside and I would ask her, you know, is that person, is that person fat and with other people she could tell, but with her own body, not a chance. She couldn't see it properly at all. And so there was a real obsession with purity among women who have anorexia and all, they'd like to starve themselves right down to the bone because the bone is sort of pure and white and there's no excess tissue on it. And so anorexia also looks like a disease of disgust. So it's very, very difficult to.

Speaker 1:          02:06          She she thought and very black and white terms. One of the things I had her do at one point was said she hasn't music. She said, I either really like a song or I don't like it at all. And I said, okay, well you've got a music collection, why don't you go through like 20 of those songs and rate them on a scale from one to 10. And she couldn't do it. It was either yes or no orderly, right? The boundaries around the categories were absolutely segregated. And her apartment tended to be decorated in black and white and she was hyper clean, you know, so everything in the apartment was extraordinarily orderly, well put away. She couldn't stand to see anything disgusting on the counters and that sort of thing. So very, very difficult disorder to treat anorexia very, very difficult. So, and you know, you can see how it can go wrong because food, when you're eating your disgust systems are on alert, you know, like you, you want the thing you want to and you absolutely don't want the thing you don't want to eat and your mouth is very sensitive to that sort of thing.

Speaker 1:          03:04          You know the texture and all of that and your sense of smell is very sensitive to that sort of thing because you know, you don't want to eat anything that's contaminated or poisonous. So it's another situation like sex where the reward system is driving you forward for, to engage in a consumer story behavior. But the disgust system is right there, mo modulating and moderating it. And there's a tension between those two things. That's already always at work. And with the anorexic types, the disgust sense of disgust system gets the upper hand. So she was also extraordinarily judgemental and perfectionistic. But that goes along with it because orderly people are judgemental and perfectionistic. And so if you're, you're a perfectionist, often what that means is you have very high levels of orderliness and very high levels of neuroticism. And those two things chase each other around like mad because you can't stand the idea that you would make a mistake and you get anxious about it as well. So then you get stuck in this perfectionistic mindset and you can't get out of it. So.
