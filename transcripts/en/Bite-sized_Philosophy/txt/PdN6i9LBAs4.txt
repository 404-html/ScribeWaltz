Speaker 1:          00:00          I think I'm going to answer where do you fall short in these 12 rules? Is it a cost constant adjustment? You know what? I wrote these rules. What you mean? Why did I write these rules? Well, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:17          and especially when I said, well, you should try to improve yourself instead of trying to set the world straight or instead of worrying about what other people are doing wrong, you might say, well that's a hell of a thing for someone to say, you just wrote a book called 12 rules for lights. It's like, no, but the thing is is that I wasn't just writing that. I was reading that for me as much as for anyone else and I mean that's. I really mean that sincerely. You know, I had an opportunity to spend somewhere around five years meditating on how you should conduct yourself so that your life is what it could be. And like I'm in the group of people that I'm advising you. You know what I mean? It's like all of these things are very difficult to stand up straight to remember that and to treat yourself like you're someone worthwhile and to make friends with people who are good for you and to tell the truth or at least not to lie.

Speaker 1:          01:04          I mean these are all ideals, right, and especially taken as a whole. They constituted a kind of ideal and you never. You never. You never attained the ideal, the eye, and not only that, it recedes as you approach it, right? Because you straighten yourself out and you think, well, I've got it now and you think, no, wait a minute. There's more to gold. There's still more to go, and then you get that much farther along the line you think, cool, yeah, I thought this was the end of the road. It's like, no, there's plenty of imperfections left to iron out, and so it is a constant adjustment and. But there's something about that that's also positive because you might say that it's not so much that there isn't such a thing as a good person. It's that our idea of what constitutes good isn't right, because a good person is someone who's trying to get better and no matter how good you are, there's better that you can get, but the real goodness is in the attempt, right? It's in. It's in the process too. To use somewhat of a Cliche, you know, there's this, oh, and I'll close with this, and it's a good way to close. You know, and this is a psychological observation. The, the central figure of Western culture is Christ. And we can look at that psychologically because Christ is the dying and resurrected hero. And what does that mean psychologically? Well, it means that

Speaker 1:          02:24          you've learned things painfully, and when you learn something painfully a part of you has to die. That's the pain. You know, when a dream is shattered, for example, a huge part of you that, that constituted that dream. Maybe even the biological substrate of that June has to be stripped away in and burned. And so life is a constant process of death and rebirth.

Speaker 1:          02:53          And to participate in that fully is to allow yourself to be redeemed by it. And so the good is that process of death and rebirth voluntarily undertaken. It's like you're not as good as you could be. So he let that part of you die. And if someone comes along and says, you know, there's some deadwood here, man, it needs to be burned off. You think, well, that stuff's still a bit alive when that Burns, it's going to hurt. It's like, yeah, well no kidding. But maybe the thing that emerges in its place is something better. And I think this is the secret of human beings. This is what we're like, you know, unlike any other creature is that we can let our old selves die and let our new selves be bored. And that's what we should do. And so where do I fall short in these 12 rules? Well, endlessly because. Well, here's a way of thinking about it until the entire world is redeemed. We all fall short. And that's probably a good place to stop.
