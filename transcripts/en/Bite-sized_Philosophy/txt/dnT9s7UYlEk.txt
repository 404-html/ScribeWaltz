Speaker 1:          00:00          And behold, the word of the Lord came unto him saying, this shall not be there in heir, but he that shall come forth out of the bottle, should be nine here. So he gets promised the impossible once again, and he brought him forth abroad and said, now look towards the heaven and tell the stars if that will be able to number them. And he said unto him, so shall thy seed be, and he believed in the Lord and he counted to him for righteousness. Seeing that this, this, this is the covenant idea, this belief, because here's the belief. It's the willingness to act as if the world is constructed so that if you do the right thing, the best possible outcome will occur. It's a decision. That's the covenant, right? So decision about how to live in the world because the evidence can't be there before you make the decision, right? And so you might hedge your bets. You know when, when Christ comes back in the book of revelation to judge people because he comes back as a judge and virtually everyone gets cast out with the chaff and not saved with the wheat, and he says something very interesting. He appears in division with a sword coming out of his mouth. It's a horrifying vision and he divides the, the he divides humanity into the damned and the save or the day. Yes, the damned and the saved. He says something very interesting. He says

Speaker 1:          01:30          to those who were neither hot nor cold, I will spew you out of my mouth. And, and it's, it's a, it's a, it's a disgust metaphor. Right? And what it says is that the worst punishment isn't waiting for those who committed to something and did wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:53          The worst punishment is reserved for those who committed to nothing and stayed on the fence. And that's really something to. That's really something to think about. And it's also something that I believe to be true because I see that stacy, this is utterly destructive because there's no progress. All the resist movement backwards. There's aging and suffering and no progress. And so to not commit to anything is the worst of all. Transgressions. To commit means to put your body and soul into something. To offer your life as a sacrifice means that you're willing to make a bargain with fate and the bargain is I'm going to act as if if I give it my all, then the best possible thing will happen because of that and to not see the analogy between that and the the active faith in God is to misunderstand the story completely and it has to be an active faith because how are you going to know?

Speaker 1:          02:48          You can look at other people, but that isn't going to do it. It's at Kierkegaard was very clear about this sort of thing. There's certain sorts of truth that you can only learn for yourself through experience. And that's of course why Abraham also has to go out alone, right? He has to leave this candidates. It's an individual. It's the individuation process like dying. It's something that you do alone. There's no way you can tell what is within your grasp, let's say, unless you make the ultimate sacrifice and there's no way of finding out without actually making it, and so that's the sacrificial act, right? That's, that's really emphasized in the act of Abraham being called upon to sacrifice. Isaac, you think about that is Abraham, he's been doing. He's been like breaking himself into pieces, trying to progress forward through starvation and tyranny and war and deceit and the potential loss of his wife and childlessness and like everything that can really be fall you in some sense.

Speaker 1:          03:42          And finally God grants him Isaac when he's old, it's impossibly gets Isaac, his son, and then what does God do next is say, well, you know, that son that you've been waiting for. So for so long it's like, I'd like to see just exactly what you're made of. So I think you should offer him up as a sacrifice. And I mean it's a very barbaric story in a sense, and maybe in more than just the sense, but Abraham does maintain his covenant. He's willing to make the sacrifice he's made, willing to make. This is the thing, he's willing to make whatever sacrifices necessary to keep his covenant with God in Tack, and that's that.
