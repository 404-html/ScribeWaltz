Speaker 1:          00:00          For a long time I understood nihilism very well. I could, I could understand its rationale associated with the tragedy of life associating with suffering and evil associated with the observation of finitude and the arbitrary and unjust nature of the world, but the more I've thought about it, the less I've come to believe that there's any excuse for it whatsoever, and I think the reason for that is that it forestalls effort. It forestalls the ability to discover for yourself maybe there's no reason to be so God damn hopeless except that it's easier to be useless now, and I'm not. Believe me, I'm not making that case. I'm not saying that that's what's be setting people who are clinically depressed, for example. That's not my point. Clinical depression is a terrible thing. There's lots of reasons to be rendered to be, to be tossed into a catastrophic condition. That isn't what I mean. I mean that kind of cynical, arrogant, rational, hyper-intelligent nihilism that throws the world away as if it's of little use before it's been properly engaged with

Speaker 1:          01:10          better to engage with it and see what happens and better to make the assumption that if the world isn't returning to you, what it is that you need, then either you're not doing it right or you've conceptualized what you need badly. Why not at least open yourself up to that possibility, right? Because you could be wrong. Hopefully if you're suffering, this is a great thing to know. Hopefully if you're suffering, you're wrong, because if you're suffering and you're right, then there's nowhere to go, so it's very useful to find out whatever errors you might be committing. Another thing that's really interesting about the Jews in the Old Testament, it's a remarkable thing. Every single time they get flattened by God, it's always their fault. They never say, the world that God created was corrupt and God is evil. They never say that no matter what happens, right, no matter what catastrophe occurs, when they have every reason to at least put that hypothesis forward, they don't. They say, we aired, we walked off the path, it's our fault, and that's hard, you know, because it puts all the weight of human catastrophe on the human being. That's very hard, but the upside is

Speaker 1:          02:29          it gives you the control. It opens up the door that it opens up the possibility that you could be the person that could set it right. If you would just let go of what's in your way, whatever that is.
