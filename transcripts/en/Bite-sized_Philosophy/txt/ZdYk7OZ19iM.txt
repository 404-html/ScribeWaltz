Speaker 1:          00:00          Does being around groups of people make you energetic or does it exhausts you, and if, if you're the sort of person that will go to a party and interact with 20 people, Indian and you have to go home and be by yourself for like two weeks, then you're introverted. Introverts are exhausted by social interactions. Extroverts are the opposite. They all, they're, they're, they're, they're energized by social interactions and you know, you might be in the middle so that you can take it or leave it with regards to social interactions, but you're happy to go to them and you're happy to spend time by yourself. But a real extrovert. There'll be some of you in here. How many of you can't stand spending time alone?

Speaker 1:          00:40          Okay, so there's only two that will admit it. Extroverts are more likely to admit that sort of thing too, by the way. But then how many of you you like to spend time alone or would rather be alone? Okay, so there is a preponderance of introverts in this class is by the, by, by all appearances. But that's a really, that's a pretty canonical question for, for extroversion versus introversion. It's a very stable trait by the way. It manifests itself early in life and it's stable across the age span, not completely. Introverts can learn to be extroverted, to extroverts, can learn to spend time on their own. I think that actually your capacity to expand your ability past the initial constraints of your biological temperament is something like the development of character or wisdom you know. So if you're an introvert by nature and you learn how to be extroverted, then that expands your domain of competence.

Speaker 1:          01:29          And if you're extroverted, you learned to be introverted. The same thing, but it's almost like imagine a distribution of extroversion, introversion here, extroversion here, a normal distribution you're set when you're young at somewhere along that distribution with some range around it. And I think what you do as you mature, if you develop your skills as you expand that range, but you're set, the place at which you're set doesn't move that much. So okay, so there's. So you can think about them as subpersonalities. You can think about them as frames of reference. So frame of reference would be something like, well, since you're extroverted, you value being with people and so you're gonna. Look at the world. For example, if you're extroverted, you come into a room like this, you think, oh look, it's a whole field of opportunity for social interactions. And if you're introverted you think, well maybe I'll go sit up in the corner and everybody leaves me the hell alone.
