Speaker 1:          00:00          Well, so then Japan, oh, shows up and he's a kindly old guy, which is pretty much exactly what you'd expect and you know, he, he's a careful craftsman and he likes kittens and you know, that's always a good thing and he has some fish and I know he's and he's good at making things and he's got a sense of humor and he's kind of playful and so he's, he's a, he's a good father. Fundamentally. He's the wise king. He's the positive archetype of the masculine. That's what he is and so he's culture and it's positive manifestation and he gives rise to this creation which is his puppet, which is what culture does because you're a puppet of your culture. You're a Marionette of your culture, and so maybe you could be more than that.

Speaker 1:          00:42          And that's the other thing that's strange about this movie and it's strange about the mythological way of looking at the world because scientifically deterministically, there's nature and there's culture and you are the deterministic product of the interaction between nature and culture. There's nothing else to you than that. That's that. But the mythological world doesn't say that. It says something different, it says that there's nature and culture and then there's you and the you that's in there has choices and the destiny and that you actually affect the interplay of nature and culture in determining your own character. And it insists upon that the oldest stories we have, there's always the hero and the archetypal mother and the archetype father. There's always those three things. There's never just two. So from the narrative perspective, there's always the implication that there is something autonomous about the, the hero of the story and you know, you can't account for that. We don't have a good way of accounting for that from a scientific perspective. I was having a discussion with Sam Harris the other day, which was very,

Speaker 2:          01:51          um,

Speaker 1:          01:53          what would you say? He said we got wrapped around an axle, which is pretty much has. Sam Harris is one of the four famous, you know, atheists along with Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins and Dan Dennett. Yeah. And so we were having a discussion and um, he's a determinist just right down to the bottom. It's like you're determined, you're determined. There's no freewill. You're a deterministic machine and you know if you're a coherent scientist and you're a Newtonian, roughly speaking, you don't really have much choice other than to think that way, but that isn't how it seems to people and we don't treat each other that way and our entire legal system is predicated on the idea that you do in fact have freewill, so well. Can we account for it? Well, no, and do we have a scientific model for it? No, but then I would also say we do not have a scientific model for consciousness.

Speaker 1:          02:44          We don't know a damn thing about consciousness, which is why Dan Dan book, which was called consciousness explained, was referred to. It's by it's critics as consciousness explained a way, which is exactly right as far as I'm concerned because he took a mechanistic and I just don't think you get to do that because there's something really weird about consciousness. I mean the phenomenologists Heidegger, who tried to radically transform western philosophy right from the bottom up. He basically said, well, you know, you can treat the world as if consciousness is primary and that human experience is reality. That's reality and that he doesn't exist independently of consciousness in any explicable way. It's like, well, what's out there? If there's nothing to to experience it while everything at once. It's something like that. It's. It's not really comprehensible as without a subject that subject defines it and makes it real.

Speaker 1:          03:38          Now you don't have to believe that, but, but at least I'm telling you that there are thoroughly coherent philosophical positions that make that case very strongly and that that allow consciousness to exist as a phenomena and to take it seriously and you certainly act like you take it seriously. You Act like there's a you and that you make choices and you certainly treat other people that way. Deterministic or not, you're still going to get angry when they're being rude to you and you're going to act as if they had some choice in the matter. Now, maybe that's an illusion possibly, but maybe it's not, and I would say the oldest stories that we have always include that as not only as a fundamental element, but even as the fundamental element.
