Speaker 1:          00:01          This is an image of, of, I would call it the patriarchy and it's a lovely image. It's God the father, and he's assimilated to the sun because, well, because consciousness which is associated with light is the builder of culture and he rules over the walled city and so he's the centering idea. You might say that that unites a culture. That's another way of looking at it. And he's got two hands. I described the miss security and tyranny altogether order and you know, if you're in a university, the u of t students complain about this all the time. There's 60,000 university students, right? They feel like numbers, they feel ignored and no wonder because their numbers and they are ignored. It's no wonder they didn't feel that way. You know, and there's huge classes of 1200 people and they get lost and they think, God, that's a pretty evil structure.

Speaker 1:          00:49          And, and uncaring. It's like, yeah, that's exactly right. But by the same token, you know, you get to purchase four years of intellectual freedom and you have all these people who could at least in principle, teach you something and you get an identity out of the deal and you have half a half a bit of sense here in the library trying to read great things and maybe you're not quite as dopey and useless when you come out as you were when you went in and so it takes with one hand and gives with the other, and you've got to understand that about your position in relationship to society. It crushes you and molds you at the same time. It limits you and furthers your compute capability at the same time, and it's up to you to determine how to establish a harmonious and productive relationship with that because that's one of the fundamental demands of life.

Speaker 1:          01:35          Now it sort of splits into these two things. That's the king who devours his son. I love that picture and that's, well, that's a society that's become tyrannical, right? I'm the son of the king is the thing that regenerates the king, the kings old and he's blind and he's stupid and he's corrupt and he has a son and the son is lively and awake and alert and can see, and if the father's not pathological, then he tries to make the sun strong so that the son can grow up and revitalize the culture and if he's a tyrant, well then he devours him and then he gets old and corrupt and everything goes into chaos. And then there's the benevolent king who's got that properly balanced and you see in this picture he's got a globe but his hand with the cross on top of it, and that's means the same thing that that other symbolic image did, which is that the proper society supports the suffering individual in his or her attempts to transcend their suffering and attain a proper ethical perspective.

Speaker 1:          02:36          And then the son of the father is the hero. That's Hercules. I really liked that picture. So Hercules goes out into the darkness and he's got this container and maybe you can think of that container as a cultural artifact. You know, because the culture protects you from chaos and then the question is what are you supposed to do with that protection? And the answer is you're supposed to wear the garb of the lion, right? That's the king of the beasts. So that's supposed to be you and you're supposed to go out there into the darkest with your bloody eyes open so you can discover what's in the darkness and share with everyone else, and he's got a club. They're in his hands and the club was covered with eyes. Those are eyes not barbs. And what that means is that you should bloody well pay attention and that well, the other element of that, it's not expressed in that image that you should also speak carefully, pay attention, and speak carefully, and then you're the proper son of the proper father and you can keep things functioning and that makes you into this.

Speaker 1:          03:28          Right? So the city is always threatened. It's always corrupt and threatened and there's always something outside that's going to take it down always. And that's what's represented by the Dragon. That little twist and its tail is something that represents infinity. And the courageous individual goes out of the damage city to confront the dragon of chaos into gained something valuable as a consequence, and that's what human beings are supposed to do. That's our destiny. That's our soul. That's a better way of thinking about it, and some of that terrible dragon is just the catastrophe and suffering of life and our continual attempts to transcendent, but a tremendous amount of it is also the malevolence and the evil that exists in our own hearts and in society and perhaps to some degree, even in the world itself. You're supposed to wake up and strengthen yourself and stand up properly and fortify yourself so that you're a light that can shine in the darkness and that's something that can withstand malevolence and tragedy.

Speaker 1:          04:27          And what's your alternative? You're going to let life crush you and make you weak and make you resentful and bitter and then murderous. You'll take out your rage on everyone you can and it'll only be limited by your capacity to obtain power. That's not a good thing. And so it's this way, or it's this way or a way that leads directly to hell and we've certainly seen that plenty of times in the last hundred years and you'd think we might have learned our lesson, but it takes a lot for people to learn and we're in danger of repeating exactly the same mistakes again.

Speaker 1:          05:03          So you know, it's one thing to complain about the political polarization and it's another thing to point fingers out. The postmodernist send the Neo Marxists even though they, they roundly deserve it. In my estimation. It's another thing to try to figure out what the proper alternative is. And a proper alternative is not, in my estimation, to contribute to political polarization. It's not good. And it's not that the radical right is the solution to the radical left. It's just another catastrophe. And the only solution that I've been able to figure out, and this is as a consequence of much reading and much thinking, is that it's up to the individuals in our society is sort themselves out and to strengthen themselves and to become wise and alert and to shoulder the responsibility of being. And the demand, the ethical demand to pushback malevolence in their own hearts and in their society.

Speaker 1:          05:54          And I also believe that, you know, it's very difficult for people to respect themselves because they're weak and vulnerable and pathetic and malevolent. And so it's no and they're not what they could be and they know it. And so it's no wonder that people don't respect themselves. And some of that's nature and some of that's culture and some of it's individual weakness. But one of the things that I've learned and it's about the only optimistic thought I've ever come across is that if you have enough courage to forthrightly accept the fact that you're vulnerable and malevolent and you're willing to do something about it, to overcome it, you can develop enough respect for yourself so that the terrible way of being will not make you malevolent and corrupt. And I don't think that you have anything better to aim for unless you want blood in the streets in a pathetic life. And so you might as well straighten up and get your act together. And maybe we've got some chance of getting through this intermediary period of chaos that we all face and make something better out of it instead of something worse. So that's what I have to say about that. So thank you. Thank you.
