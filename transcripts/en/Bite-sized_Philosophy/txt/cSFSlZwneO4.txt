Speaker 1:          00:01          If you concentrate solely on your career, you can get along way in your career, and I would say that that's a strategy that a minority of men preferentially do, that that's all they do. They worked like 70, 80 hours a week. They'd go flat out on their career. They're staking everything on the small probability of exceptional status in a narrow domain, but it's. It's hard on them. They don't have a life. It's very difficult for them to have a family. They don't know how to take any leisure activity like they get very one dimension. Now it may be that that unit dimensionality is the price you have to pay to be exceptional at one thing, right? Because if you're going to be something like a genius level mathematician and you want to do that for, or a scientists say, it's like you're in your lab, you're in your lab all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:46          You're working 70 hours a week or 80 hours a week, you're smart, you're dedicated, you're unit dimensional, and that's how you get to beat all the other people who are doing that. It's the only way, but the problem is you don't get a life. Now, if you love being a scientist and you have that kind of focus of mind, well first of all, you're a rare person and second you're going to pay for it, but fine. More power to you, but, but it's, uh, it's a risky business to do that. You sacrifice a lot for it. You know, and I would say most often if you're speaking about having a healthy life, that isn't what you do. You spread yourself out more. So you know, you have a family, you have some things that you do outside of work that are meaningful to you and useful.

Speaker 1:          01:31          You, you have a network of friends, um, that, that, those three things, a loaner for things, a loner, plenty to keep you well oriented. And then if one of those things collapses, you know, everything doesn't go now. The price you pay for that is, the more you strive to optimize that balance, the less likely you are to be fantastically successful at any single one of them. But you might have a very, you know, if you consider your life as a whole, that might be a winning strategy. One of the things, Carl Young, sad, I really liked this. He thought that men went after perfection and when women went after wholeness, so there are different, there are different value there. They're different. There's something different at the top of the value hierarchy. So perfection would be steak, it all in one thing and look for radical success. Not all, not that all men do that because they don't. But we're talking about extremes at least with regards to the men that do that. The wholeness ideas more like, well, I want, I want. It's like I want one thing in my life to be 150 percent or I want five things in my life to be 80 percent.

Speaker 1:          02:44          Well there, there's a lot more richness in a life where you have five things operating at 80 percent, but you're not operating in any at any of them at 150 percent. So, and I really believe this because I've watched men and women go through their careers now for a long period time and one of the things that there's lots of things that produce this, but one of the things that I've noticed is that mostly women in their thirties bear bail out of unidimensional dimensional careers. They won't do them. They won't. They won't put it in the 80 hours a week that they would have to put in in order to dominate that particular area. And it isn't. The reason that they won't do it is because they decide it's not worth it and no wonder because why would that be worth it? You have to ask yourself that.

Speaker 1:          03:29          It's like, well, you want to be an outstanding scientists. Like, okay, really, really, that's what you want because that means that's what you do because you're competing with other people. You know, they're smart, they're hardworking, and if you want to be at the top, you have to be smarter and work harder than any of them. And working hard means working long hours. I mean, it also means working diligently, but in in the final analysis, it's also an additive issue. If I'm smart and hard working and I can crank out for 70 hours a week and you do it for 30, it's like in two years, I'm so far ahead of you. You will never ever catch up. So anyways. And I think partly maybe part of the reason too that women are oriented that way more than men. I think there's two reasons is one is socioeconomic status does not make women more attractive on the mating market, but it does make men more attractive.

Speaker 1:          04:19          And the second is women's timeframe is compressed, right? Because guys can always say, well I'll have kids later and they can say that until they're like 80. Whereas women, it's like, no way man. You gotta get you gotta get it together. By the time you're, let's say 40, but really probably by 35, but definitely by 40 because otherwise it ain't happening and that's bloody dreadful. Like the most unhappy people you ever see. No, no. One of the common roots to extreme unhappiness is to want children and not have the. I wouldn't recommend that. You know, you see couples who were in their thirties, one couple in three over the age of 30 has fertility problems that's defined as an inability to conceive after one year of trying one in three. So it's worth thinking about because people are very, very unhappy. If they want to have kids and then they can't, man, you're in the medical mill for 10 years. If that's, if that's what happens to you.
