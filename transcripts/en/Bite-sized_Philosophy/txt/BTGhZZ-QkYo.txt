Speaker 1:          00:00          One of the things that Carl Jung said that I thought was really interesting when he was talking about the Oedipal situation and families, I never forgot this, so the Oedipal situation, roughly speaking, is when I'll, I'll lay out the classic story is when a child is seriously over-protected, usually a male child by his mother. Now the reverse can be the case and it can be a female child by the mother and all of that, but I'll just talk about the classic case to begin with. Now. What Freud observed was that there were usually not very good boundaries in families like that and so the relationship between the husband and the wife was either strange or nonexistent and the wife would often turn to the child to be what she isn't getting from the husband, and so there's a great south park episode about this, a wonderful south park episode where they were.

Speaker 1:          00:47          I don't remember that horrible little guy. Is that. That's him. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And his mother brings in the dog whisperer to train him and it's brilliant. It's brilliant episode. If you want to learn about Freud and Freud and Oedipal situation, you watch that. You've got it down cold because she brings in this expert who then she wants to have an affair with, so that's a boundary issue and he basically separates her son from him and and, and imposes the same discipline on him that he would get impose on a bad dog. Although he also trains the dogs owners all the time because maybe it's not the dog. Maybe it's the owner. There's a horse whisperer movie too, about the original horse whisperer. That does a beautiful job of laying that out too because he's very good at fixing problem horses and unbelievably good at diagnosing psychopathology on the part of the owner.

Speaker 1:          01:37          It's his, he's got a gift for it. But anyways, what happens in this South Park episode is that the dog whisperer gets cartland yeah. Straightened out and he starts like dressing properly and doing his homework and, and the mother is pursuing an affair with the dog whisperer, but he's professional. He keeps his distance, like he keeps boundaries around him and then he leaves. And then the first thing that she does when he leaves his bride carton and basically out of doing his homework so that he can accompany her to, I don't know, a fast food restaurant or something like that. And so the reason she does that is because she's lonesome and doesn't have anybody else around. And you know, maybe she's also deeply, deeply, deeply terrified that if she helps that boy grow up, he will leave and she'll have nothing, you know. And so mothers who don't have something say outside their infants, not merely their children are more likely to fall into that.

Speaker 1:          02:32          And it's no wonder, you know, you got to think that through. And lots of women really, most women really fall in love with their babies, you know. And so even if they start growing into larger children, that can be threatening because, well, when that, when the child turns into, when the infant turns into a toddler that the infant is dead, the toddler is there now. And you can radically interfere with that process. That happens all the time, all the time. That's the classic Freud in Eda pulled nightmare. And that episode is brilliant, it's bloody brilliant, it just nails it and some of you have been in my personality class and watched crumb the documentary crum, and that's another staggering exposition of exactly that kind of pathology. Anyways, one of the things you pointed out, so I knew this guy once who had a mother who basically was trying that trick and she had lots of.

Speaker 1:          03:27          She was very smart and had lots of tricks up our sleeves and there's just no way he was going to go for. He rebelled at every possible moment and he basically became, I would say, somewhat hypermasculine in response, which is a. which is an interesting lesson with regards to the hypermasculinity that boys often develop if they're raised by single mothers because they tend to go one of two ways and he just thought her at every step of the way and it didn't happen. But one of the things you said, which I loved, and you can really see this in the chrome documentary, is that the eternal mother basically entices. The child says, look, here's the deal. You don't have to do anything but you don't get to leave, but if you don't leave and you don't do these difficult things, then I'll take care of you and the child has a choice all the way along there.

Speaker 1:          04:12          I mean, obviously he's outclassed in some sense, but it's not as obvious as you'd think. Little kids are tough and they make decisions all the time and so Jung thought about it more as a conspiracy than as something imposed on the child by the mother and I really like. It's actually a conspiracy between mother, father, and child actually and I think that's a good way of looking at it even though it's really rough because said, well, should you hold a child responsible? Well, yes, but judiciously and not completely because then if you deal with someone like that as an adult and they're trying to escape from it, you have to go all the way back and figure out how the hell had happened and then they have to adjust. They have to figure out where they opened the door, like inviting a vampire in because they can't come in unless you invite them in, you know, so don't invite them in because once they're in, they're really hard to get rid of and they'll take all your blood. So that's a cautionary tale.
