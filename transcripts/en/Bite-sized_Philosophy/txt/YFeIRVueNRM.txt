Speaker 1:          00:00          And the psychoanalyst, I think, err too much on the side of the subject. They tend to think that too much of you is inside of you and too little of us outside of you. And part of the reason I believe that is because of my clinical experience. I love the psychoanalyst Matt. They're brilliant, they're brilliant or deep. They grapple with real problems like with the problems when people have real problems that I mean profound problems. They're really profound moral problems or problems of good and evil really. You know, there are things going on in their family that are so terrible that well that there are, there are sometimes fatal, you know, lie upon, lie upon, lie upon lie for decades and decades and decades. It's awful. And that's not exactly inside them. It's out there in the world. And lots of the people that I see, very famous critic of psychology,

Speaker 1:          01:08          I can't remember his name, but I probably will criticize the practice of psychology quite effectively in the believe in the early sixties. The Myth of mental illness by Thomas Sad, zed, a s zed. It's classic. You should read it if you're interested in psychology. Read it like it's. It's a classic and he basically said, most people have problems in living. They don't have psychological problems, and so I've experienced, despite my love for the psychoanalysts, very frequently what I'm doing as a therapist is helping people have a life that would work. You know, and you can parameterize that. It's like, what do you need? How about some friends that people kind of like that? How about an intimate relationship with someone that you can trust that maybe has a future? That'd be good. How about a career that puts you in a dominance hierarchy somewhere so at least you've got some possibility of rising, some possibility of stabilizing yourself and a schedule and a routine because no one can live without a routine.

Speaker 1:          02:16          You just forget that if you guys don't have a routine, I would recommend you get one going because you cannot be mentally healthy without a routine. You need to pick a time to get up whatever time you want, but pick one and stick to it because otherwise you disregulate your circadian rhythms and they regulate your mood and eat something. In the morning. I had lots of clients who've that anxiety disorders, hired one client who was literally starving, very smart girl. She was very little that she liked. She kind of tried to subsist on like half a cup of rice a day. She came to me and said, I have no energy. I come home. All I want to do is watch the same movie over and over. What? Like, is that weird? And I thought, well, it depends on how hard you work. You know, it's a little weird, but whatever. It's familiar, you're looking for comfort. So I did an analysis of her diet. It's like three quarters of a cup of rice. It's like you're starving, eat something, you know, you'll feel better. So she modified her diet and you're all around. Anxiety went away and she had some energy. It's like, yeah, you got to eat. So schedule. That's a good thing, man. Your brain will. Thank you for it. It will stabilize your nervous system where there's a bit of a plan. That's a good thing. You need a career. You need something productive to do with your time. You need to regulate your use of drugs and alcohol. Most particularly alcohol because that does even a lot of people.

Speaker 1:          03:55          You need a family, like the family, you have your parents and all that. It'd be nice if you all got along. You could work on that. That's a good thing to work on and then you know, you probably need children at some point. That's life. That's what life is and if you're missing, you know, you may have a good reason to not be operating on one of those dimensions. It's not mandatory, but I can tell you that if you're not operating reasonably well on four, I think I mentioned six, if you're not operating reasonably well on at least three of them, there's no way you're going to be psychologically thriving and that's more pragmatic in some sense than psychological, right? Human beings have a nature. There's things we need and if we have them well that's good and if we don't have them well then we feel the lack.

Speaker 1:          04:46          So behaviorists, behavioral psychologists concentrate a lot more on that sort of thing. You know, it's practical. It's like strategizing. Make a career plan, figure out how to negotiate because that's bloody important. Figuring out how to say what you need, figure out how to tell the truth to people, figure out how to listen to your partner in particular because if you listen to them, they will actually tell you what they want and sometimes you can give it to them and maybe they'll return the favor. And if you practice that for like 15 years, well then maybe you're constantly giving each other what you want. Well Hooray. That would be good. And then there's two of you under both circumstances and it's better to have two brains than one because people think differently because of their temperament mostly. And so the negotiation is where the wisdom arises and it's part of the transformation, the psychological transformation that's attendant on an intimate relationship, and one of the fundamental purposes of a longterm intimate relationship.
