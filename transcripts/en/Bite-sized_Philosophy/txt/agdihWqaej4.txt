Speaker 1:          00:01          So this is more differentiation of the archetype fundamentally. So you see the dragon of chaos here, that potential manifesting itself into this ambivalent feminine figure, both both promise and threat. And then I've. I've mapped this one out. So the ambivalent feminine figure, so sort of multi valence gives rise to the positive mother and then the positive mother gives birth to the hero and that's Hercules there and this. I like this image a lot. So Hercules is in this container so that you can interpret that. Both has something feminine, that container but also as a representative of culture because it's a boat that is floating on the chaotic ocean here. So that target, he asked to be in a container that sustains him in the murky water of chaos and you see he's going out into the unknown and he's got a lion's skin on. And that's partly because one of the initiation rituals for, for young men when the reliance say in the Middle East and that wasn't very long ago, was that you had to go and kill a lion with a spear and with a bow and Arrow or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:59          It's like that's impressive. All things considered. I mean you really think about that for a minute. You really want to go out and try to kill a lion with a stick. It's like it probably. You probably wouldn't be quite the same after you did that. That would be my guess. And so anyways, so there's. Hercules has got his lion skin on and that shows that he's assimilated to the lion, the dominant sort of animal and that he's also mastered it and he's got his bow and Arrow to so he's. He's going to hit the target properly. He's not. He's someone who doesn't seem because he can hit the center of the target and he's got this club which I really liked because it's covered with eyes just like Martech, Mesopotamian hero. Well, what do you want to do when you go out into the unknown, it's like arm yourself and pay attention and so that's what you're trying to produce.

Speaker 1:          01:43          If you're a good mother is this figure that can go out into the unknown, armed, accurate, and able to pay attention and that's a hell of a thing to participate in and it's really fun. I found having children incredibly entertaining. It's ridiculously entertaining thing to do because for a bunch of reasons. One is that it's the only relationship you'll ever have in your life where you, where you actually have a chance of establishing something that's close to perfect is with your kids because when they're delivered to you, so to speak, they're there in some sense they're perfect and your job is to maintain that perfection. If you can, and you do that by being a good parent, by being encouraging, by being on their side, by taking care of them, and you can have an absolutely pristine relationship with the child. That doesn't mean it's not full of trouble because it is, but it's it.

Speaker 1:          02:32          It can easily be the best relationship you'll ever have in your life. In fact, I think that's. It can be the worst to and you know sometimes you get unlucky in your child is sick mentally or physically and things fall apart and it's not your fault, but sometimes it is your fault, but it's a real gift and you have to play this game of protection and encouragement, right? Protection and encouragement and get that dynamic right, and then you build, you help someone develop into something that's well exactly this, that can take on the troubles of the world forthrightly and man, that's what you want. That'll make it worthwhile, that's for sure.
