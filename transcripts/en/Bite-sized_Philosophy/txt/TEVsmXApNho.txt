Speaker 1:          00:00          Now this, the baboon here who's supposed to be basically just a fool. When the story was first written, he turned into what's essentially a shaman across time and so he represents the self from the union perspective. Now the self is everything you could be across time, so imagine that there's you and there's the potential inside you. Whatever that is and potential is an interesting idea because it's represents something that isn't yet real. Yet we act like it's real because people will say to you, you should live up to your potential and that potential is partly what you could be if you interacted with the world in a manner that would gain you the most information, right? Because you build yourself out of the information in the piagetian sense, but it's deeper than that too because we know that if you take yourself and you put yourself in a new environment, new genes turned on in your nervous system, they encode for new proteins and so you're full of biological potential.

Speaker 1:          00:53          That won't be realized unless you move yourself around in the world into different challenging circumstances and that'll turn on different circuits. So it's not merely that you're incorporating information from the outside world in the constructivist sense, it's that by exposing yourself to different environments, you put different physiological demands on yourself all the way down to the genetic level and that manifests new elements of you. And so one of the things that happens to people, and this is a very common cultural notion, is that you should go on a pilgrimage at some point to somewhere central in that would be say like the rock pride rock in the lion king because you take yourself out of your dopey little village and that's just the little bounded you that everyone knows and that isn't very expanded. And then you go somewhere dark and dangerous to the central place and while you do that, you have adventures and they toughen you and pull more out of you.

Speaker 1:          01:44          Like partly because you're becoming informed, which means information. It means you're becoming more organized at every level of analysis. But there's also more of you too. And so that's a very classic idea. And then in in cathedrals in Europe, especially at charter, there's a big maze on the floor, a circular maize, which is a symbolic representation of the pilgrimage for people who couldn't do it. And so it's a huge circle divided into quadrants, which is a union Mandela. And you enter the maize at one point and then you have to walk through the entire maze north, east, west, and south before you get to the center. And the center is symbolized by a flower that's carved in stone. It looks like this. It's big. This maze, hey, it's large so that you can walk it. And that's a symbolic pilgrimage. It takes you to the center.

Speaker 1:          02:30          That's the center of the cross because it's in a cathedral. And that's the point of acceptance, of voluntary suffering. That's what that means. And so you walk through, you can call that a circum ambulation. You go to all the corridors of the world to find yourself. And so while the self is, is the baboon in this particular, in this pr, I think he's a mandrill actually in this particular representation. And he lives in the tree. He lives in the tree of life. It's a bail bab tree in this particular, so the spirit that inhabits the tree of life and he's the eternal wise man. That's a way of thinking, so is the king, but he's. He's sort of a superordinate king or an outside king in some sense. He's the repository of ancient wisdom and the king is the manner in which that wisdom is currently being acted out in the world and so their friends, and that means that the king is a good king because if they, if the king was a bad king, he would be alienated from himself and that would make him shallow and one dimensional and that would make him a bad ruler.

Speaker 1:          03:29          No union with the traditions of the past. To be a good ruler, you have to rescue your father from the underworld and integrate that, and of course that's a main theme in this entire movie.
