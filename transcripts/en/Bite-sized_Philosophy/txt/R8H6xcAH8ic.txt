Speaker 1:          00:00          You know what, one of the things that I've been struck very hard by a number of writers, Carl Young, obviously among them, I mean he, he wrote things like Nicha that if you understand them, they just break you into pieces, you know, and, and one of the things that young understood in the psychoanalysts understand it's one of the most terrifying elements of psychoanalytic thinking is very tightly allied with religious thinking, which is that you are not the master of your own house. There are spirits that dwelling within you, meaning you have a will and you can exercise a certain amount of conscious control over your being, but there are all sorts of things that occur within you that seemed to be beyond your capacity to control your dreams. For example, that's a really good example. Are Your impulses. For example, you might, you might think of those as so foreign from you that they're not even.

Speaker 1:          00:50          You don't even want them to be part of you, but, but more subtly even. How about what you're interested in, what compels you? Like, where does that come from? Exactly. Because you can't. God, you can't conjure it up of your own accord, you know, so if you're a student in your taking difficult course, you might say to yourself, well, I need to sit down and study for three hours, but then you sit down and that is what happens. Your attention goes everywhere and you might say, well, whose attention is it? Then? If it goes everywhere because you say it's your attention, it's like, well, if it's your attention, maybe you will be able to control it, but you can't. And so then you might think, well jen and just exactly what the hell is controlling it. And you might say, well, it's random. It's better not be random.

Speaker 1:          01:33          I can tell you that that's, that happens to some degree in schizophrenia. There's an element of randomness in that. It's not random, it's driven by the action of, of phenomena that I think are best considered as something like subpersonalities or they'll even. That's only a partial description. You can't make yourself interested in something. Interest manifests itself in grips you. That's a whole different thing. And so what is it that's gripping you and how do you conceptualize that? Is that a divine power? Well, it's defined as far as you're concerned because it grips you and you can't do anything about it, and so there's a calling in you towards what you're compelled by and what you're interested in that sometimes that might be very dark and sometimes not, but you're compelled forward by your interest and so and so the idea that what moves you away from your country and your father's house and the comforts of your childhood home is, is something that's beyond you and that you listened to and Harken to.

Speaker 1:          02:35          That's exactly right. And you can say, well, I don't want to call that God. It's like it doesn't matter what you call it. Exactly. It doesn't matter to what it is, what it's called. It still is, and if you don't listen to it, that's the other thing. If you don't listen to it, and I've been a clinician and talked to enough people now as old as I am to know this. Absolutely. If you do not to that thing that beckons you forward, you will pay for it like you cannot possibly imagine. You'll have everything that's terrible about life in your life and nothing about it that's good and worse. You'll know that it was your fault and that you squandered what you could have had.
