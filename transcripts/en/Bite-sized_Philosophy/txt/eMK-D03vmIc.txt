Speaker 1:          00:00          One of the Kennedy's genius boys came up with the cars, Kennedy's administration was run by a lot of Harvard graduates and Ivy League graduates, and so, you know, they were supposed to be pretty intelligent, but intelligence and wisdom are not the same thing, but anyways, um, they established a policy which was called mutual assured destruction, which means if you hit me, I kill you and then you kill me. And so it'd be better if we just didn't bother. And the acronym was mad, right? Mutual assured destruction. It's like, you know, just thinking about that it, it's a chilling thought. It's like what horrible entity thought that up as a joke. You know, when you think, well, does that sum. It says that some politicians, ib of width, like where'd that come from? So that's a hell of a thing to make a joke about, you know, mad.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Well that was right. It was definitely mad, you know. And the, the, the odd thing is, is that we didn't blow ourselves up and we didn't have a third World War. And you know, you, you can't make a solid claim that the invention of nuclear weapons was necessarily the worst thing that could have happened, you know, because even the Soviets who were completely insane, and of course the model was to probably even worse, they weren't insane enough to start a nuclear war. Now style it, there's evidence, there is debate about it, but there was an. There's evidence that Stalin was basically murdered partly by cruise ship, was who was his, who was his successor when Stalin died, Khrushchev and three other people were in his house and what happened in Stalin's house the night he died is not clear, but I read a book recently called stolen.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Interestingly enough, that was written by a guy who had access to the full communist party archives, which was relatively new thing. And that was his conclusion. And he also believed that Stalin was gearing up to do it, an invasion of Europe and that he didn't give a damn how many cities would have to be bombed in order for the Soviets to rule through. And Stalin. He was like that, you know, Stalin was perfectly capable of taking entire nations of people out in eastern Europe by train and shipping them out to Siberia in the middle of the winter with nothing to eat and no tools and letting them live, which of course they didn't. And that meant women, children, men, you know, shorn of all their belongings and thrust out into the middle of nowhere to perish or, or, or live as they saw fit and if they perished so much, the better as far as Stalin was concerned.

Speaker 1:          02:24          And so he wasn't exactly the sort of person, the idea of a nuclear war would necessarily stop. And it's certainly possible that that's what he was hoping for. You know, because when we look at people like Stalin and Hitler, we think, well, you know, thereafter world domination, you know, and you think, well in some sense that's kind of a positive motivation, right? I mean, not really, but it's like if you have a corvette say and someone steals it, you can think, well, I know why they stole it. They want to have the corvette. You know, it's, it's an understandable motivation to want power. It's not necessarily an admirable one. Sometimes power is a perfectly reasonable thing to pursue, but I don't have any idea why we ever assume that those guys were after victory. Like you should never make the presupposition that everyone is out to when some people are out to lose and the more people they can take with them, the better.

Speaker 1:          03:16          You know. And when Hitler died, he committed suicide in a bunker way down below Berlin. West Berlin was on fire and Europe was burning. It's like, as far as I can tell, that was exactly what Hitler was after right from the beginning. You know, he was interested in fire as a purifying agent. You know, he's a fire worship or in some sense because if you look at the Nuremberg gatherings of the Nazis, you know, they're spectacular, spectacular celebrations, unbelievably dramatic and impressive. And they frequently featured fire and fire's up purifying agent know, and Hitler, by the end of World War Two was he was pretty contemptuous of the Germans because they really hadn't served him well. That it wasn't like he thought, well maybe it wasn't such a good idea to start a whole second world war, you know, because he was a little on the narcissistic side we might say, but by the time the Russians came marching in Germany was in ruins.

Speaker 1:          04:07          Hitler was perfectly happy to have the allies tromp all over the citizens because that's what they deserved anyways. And so that's the sort of guy he was. And so why we would assume that he wanted to win just because that's what he said is something I'd never been able to understand. You know, the kids who shot up columbine didn't want to win. I wanted to kill as many people as possible to make a point and then they wanted to kill themselves just in case you didn't exactly get the point. And the point was the more destruction the battery and if I have to go along with it, hey, no problem. That just makes me a little bit more serious than I might've otherwise be. And so those sorts of motivations are not pleasant to understand, but we have enough documentation about events like that, you know, especially the mass killings.

Speaker 1:          04:51          Those guys have written down exactly why they do it. Now. I have some excellent books on extraordinary vengeful, a map serial killers that mass murders. I know exactly how they think. There's a great book if you're interested in this sort of thing called pans, Ram p a n Zed r a, m and Carl Pants. Ram was a serial killer and rapist who lived pretty much early in the 20th century. And he was a tough delinquency sorta kid from a large family. And when he was, you know, 13, 14, they sent them off to some reform school and it was really run by the same sort of people that run Canada's residential schools and you know, so those were basically predators on children. And of course he was raped and, and, and, and brutalized and tormented and in all sorts of horrible ways. And, but he was a tough guy.

Speaker 1:          05:39          And when he came out he decided that, you know, the human race really wasn't worth that much. And that he was going to reek as much mayhem as he possibly could for the rest of his life. He raped a thousand men. He killed dozens of people. He kept track of the dollar value of the buildings. He burned down like this was a serious guy and he wasn't. He was bent on destruction and that's that when he was. What were his dying words? First of all, there was a committee, I believe, of women who intervened on behalf of him because they were anti capital punishment. And he said to them, if I remember correctly, that he wished the human race had one neck so that he could put his hands around it and squeeze. So you know, that was his way of pointing out to the people who didn't think that maybe capital punishment was justified in his case that maybe they weren't thinking clearly. And then to the hang man, he said, hurry up you who's your bastard? I could kill 10 men in the time it takes you to hang me. So you know, you don't get a statement like that from someone who isn't thoroughly committed to what he's doing.
