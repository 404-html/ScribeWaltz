Speaker 1:          00:00          God has a little chat with him and he says, well, W W, why are you angry and and why? Why are you upset? And cain says, and God says, if you do well, won't you be accepted? And if you don't do well, sin lies at your door and unto thee shall be his desire. And now shout rule over him. Okay? That's a very mangled translation I would say, so I'm going to take it apart. So what God says is while you're angry and you're upset, it's like, well, what's your problem? And then God tells kate if you did things properly, they would work out for you. Well, it's the last thing he wants to hear it because what cain wants to believe is that the reason he's not doing very well is because there's no sense having any faith in the logos. The transcendent is, is evil and aimed exactly against him, and the entire social contract is faulty. That's what he wants to hear, but that isn't what God says. God says, well, wait a minute, maybe you're doing something wrong.

Speaker 2:          00:56          Well,

Speaker 1:          00:58          that's maybe a worse message than everything else is corrupt. It's like you're having a problem because you're just not everything you could be. Well, and then God says something really nasty and you can't tell from this lines. I read a bunch of translations to try to figure out exactly what it meant. So this is what God tells kate. He says, you're in a room in a house and there's something at the door, and he uses a metaphor. God uses a metaphor. It's a sexually, a lot aroused predatory cat, and you invited in even invited. Did you know that it has evil intent. You invited in to meet with you, right? And you're. It's, it's union with you. This, this malevolent force, this sexual union with you has produced an offspring and that offspring is what possesses you. And so not only have you done something wrong, you've, you've invited the spirit of wrongdoing into your life and you've creatively intermingled it with it voluntarily to bring forth a monster of your own creation. So that's what God tells Kane. So like,

Speaker 1:          02:06          look, it's bad enough that God says, you know, you should get your act together because maybe that's why things aren't going so well for you before you criticize the transcendent and the world and the structure of being. Maybe you're doing something wrong, but it's worse than that. He says, not only are you doing something wrong, you bloody well know you're doing something wrong and you and you're doing it creatively and with intent, so not only are things not going well for you, but you've played a creative role in producing that situation and so god basically says, I am taking zero responsibility for rejecting your sacrifice. It's all on you. And so kane leaves and he's like, seriously? Not Happy with that response because he wanted to hear Pat, pat, you're a victim of circumstance and everything's conspiring against you. And really being God, I should get my act together and just give you what you want.

Speaker 1:          02:56          Because obviously being God I'm wrong and you're right. Well that isn't what happens. It's exactly the opposite of that. It's completely on you. That's the, that's the judgment. And so kane leaves and believe me, he's, he was wroth before it. His countenance had fallen before, but it's nothing like it is now. And so he's hits the next stage and he thinks, okay, I'm going to take my revenge. What am I going to do? I'm going to find the most innocent and worthwhile thing that's favored of God and I'm going to kill it. And that's what he does. And it doesn't matter. That's his brother and able, you know, we're drawing the inference. Ables done the right things. Everyone likes them. Everything's flourishing for Abel. He's a good guy. He's one of those people that you meet that has everything. And then you meet them and you wish you could hate them, but you can't because they're really good people.

Speaker 1:          03:42          And then you're really hate them because not only do they have everything, but it appears that they deserve it. And there's nothing that sort of sits in your soul and rots it more than that realization. And so that's the situation with Cain. And so thinks Cain talked with Abel, his brother, and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel, his brother, and slew him. So that's so interesting because look, look what happens to cane here. So he's not doing well. He's separated from the transcendent and from society. He's bitterly resentful and now he goes out and kills the very thing that he most wants to be. So he destroys his own ideal, right? He just demolishes his own ideal. That's how far his resentment has pushed him. And so he's, he's done right? But it doesn't matter because it enables him to take revenge.

Speaker 1:          04:31          So he doesn't care. It's like, it's like the suicidal school shooter that blows off his head at the end of his mayhem. It's like it doesn't matter to him. It's part of the same art form. And the Lord says unto Cain, where is Abel? And cain said, I know. I don't know, am I my brother's keeper? While that's a good question, and that's why it's posed in the story, because the answer that I supposed to be yes. And God says, what have you done? The Voice of your brother's blood cries unto me from the ground. That's actually the Motif that Dostoevsky explorers, I would say in crime and punishment because what happens is that was calling the coffee's cane for all intents and purposes, and he commits a murder, but he gets away with it. Well, so he thinks so. We thinks no one suspects him. He buries the money. He can't stand to touch the body.

Speaker 1:          05:21          He buries it in a in an abandoned lot, and he's drawn there now and then to look at where it is, but he can't touch it because the money. It's so funny because the money before he kills the pawnbroker is not the same as the money after he kills the pawn broker. And the risk only the before he kills the pawnbroker is not the same as the risk and the cough after he kills the pole broker. In fact, they're not the same at all. And so [inaudible] Nicole have is tormented by God, you could say, but not from the external world. He sets the crime up quite nicely. It's that this, this spirit against which transgressed tortures him from within and there's no escape from it, and so eventually what happens in crime and punishment is was called Nicole have continues to manifest himself as guilty in every possible way until he receives the punishment that he desires because it's the only way that he can set things right. He actually, he actually, he essentially turns himself in eventually because he can't tolerate what he's done so well. So that's the idea. The Voice of thy brother's blood cries unto me from the ground. It's guilt

Speaker 1:          06:34          and now you're cursed from the earth which has opened her mouth to receive your brother's blood from thy hand. When you till the ground, it will not henceforth yield to you its strength and a fugitive and a vagabond shall thou be in the earth. You know? And you might say, well why does God not just straight and dead? And the answer to that perhaps is that wouldn't be sufficient punishment. That's what it looks like to me. It's like what's the punishment? You live with what you did.

Speaker 1:          07:09          Right? And I don't want anybody taking you out either because then you won't have to live with what you did. So that's the punishment. And cain says, under the Lord, my punishment is greater than I can bear. It's like, yeah, behold you have driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall I be here. That's the same as what happens to Adam in the garden of Eden. Remember, Adam hides from God and he has his reasons. And now cain is alienated from God. There's no read, there's no reconstructing that relationship. He's put himself by violating his contract, but say with the transcendent and also with society and also with his own spirit, he's put himself outside the possibility of redemption. And that's why he says the punishment is greater than I can bear. There's no hope left, right? So he's in hell for all intents and purposes.
