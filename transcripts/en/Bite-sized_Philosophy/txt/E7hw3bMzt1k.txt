Speaker 1:          00:00          Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah, brimstone and fire from the Lord out of Heaven, and he overthrew the cities and all the plane and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew up on the ground, but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt, known histology for catastrophe. I think that's what that means is that when you leave what's not good, you wash the dust off your feet and you don't look back, and that's a very harsh lesson. This is echoed a bit, the New Testament, the idea of the necessity for immediate action. These are some of the harsher words that Christ said. This is from Matthew Eight. Christ is addressing a multitude and asking people to follow him, and a disciple comes up to him and says, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father. Seems like a perfectly reasonable request, but Jesus said unto him, follow me, and let the dead bury their dead. This is from Matthew 12. Well, he had talked to the people. Behold his mother and his brethren stood without desiring to speak with him. Then one said to him, behold, thy mother and I, brethren, stand without desiring to speak with the, but Jesus answered the one who was telling him and said, who is my mother and who is my brother's

Speaker 1:          01:33          for whosoever shall do the will of my father, which is in heaven, the same as my brother and sister and mother. Well, what does all that mean? It means that there's no excuses whatsoever for not getting up and getting out it. That's what it means and it means that

Speaker 1:          01:55          it even means that when people are beset with a catastrophe, like let's say the death of their father, that they are prone to use that as an excuse for not going about the business that they should be going about because they can say to themselves, well, I would except, and except there's always good reasons. I mean, believe me, there's always good reasons for not doing what you should. It's for sure the reasons pile up day after day to not do what you should, especially cause you're, you're aiming at things in the future. You can put them off and definitely right because of the demands of the day, but these stories, they say a variety of things, you know, and especially in combination. They say when you leave somewhere terrible, do not look back. There's known astrologer that's, that's the letting the dead parts of yourself go

Speaker 1:          02:47          and then if you're going to follow the good, there's no excuse not to do it and that it means no excuse whatsoever under any circumstances. And then it's taken even farther. With regards to familial relationships, it is. You can't even let them stand in your way and I think that's all true and I think I've seen virtually all of that in my clinical practice. Like there is no excuse whatsoever for not getting at what it is that you should be doing and I think there's something else that's going on here, especially in the new testament stories which has even made maybe worse, which is it's absolutely reprehensible to justify your inaction with a catastrophe that extract mercy from other people. Right? There's a tricky, tricky game that's going well, of course I can't do that. Look at the terrible thing that's just happened to me and say, oh, okay, I understand you're absolved of any necessity to move forward because of your current catastrophe. It's like, well, actually you're not, and it's rather rude of you to use it as an excuse and it's certainly counterproductive.
