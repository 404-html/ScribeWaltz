Speaker 1:          00:00          There's this thing that exists, this, this multi-headed snake, and it's got this infinity problem. It's everywhere. That's that little circle down there, and the problem is, well, what do you do with it? You cut off one head, seven more, grow. That's the eternal problem of life and the problem is they're there. There is the category of problems in life and it ain't going anywhere. And so the question is can you deal with the whole category at the same time? That's the thing. That's how to be in the world is to deal with that category all at the same time. And so how did, how did human beings, what did they come up with as a solution? And that's so cool too, because the solution they come up with not only was the heroism that allows you to approach what you're terrified by and what you find offensive and to learn from it, but also the idea of sacrifice and that was played out by cultures everywhere, including human sacrifice.

Speaker 1:          00:52          And you think what the hell was up with those crazy bastard so long ago? They were sacrificing to the gods all the time, but kind of clueless behavior was that burned something and please God burned something valuable and please God. It's like, what was with, what were they thinking? Well, they weren't stupid. Those people, if they were stupid, we wouldn't be here. They were not stupid and believe me, they lived under a lot harsher conditions than we do. So those were some tough people, man. You know, back then you'd last about 15 minutes. And so you don't want to be thinking of your ancestors as stupid, like there's no real evidence that we're much different cognitively than we were 150,000 years ago. So anyways, sacrifice. What does that mean? Sacrifice? Well, it's a discovery man. It's the discovery of the future. It's like the future is actually the place where there is threat and it's always going to be there.

Speaker 1:          01:46          So what do you do? You make sacrifices in the present so that the future is better, right? Everyone does that. That's what you're doing right now. That's what you're doing here. That's what your parents are doing when they pay money to send you to university, they think let you can bargain with reality. It's amazing. You can bargain with reality. You can forestall gratification now and it'll pay off at a place in time that doesn't even exist yet. It's like, who wouldn't believe that? It's like that's a miracle that that occurs and it's not like people just figured that out over night, you know, we were champs for Christ's sake. Like how are we going to come up with an idea like that while it's like, well, we thought about it for 7 million years and you know, we got to the point where we could kind of act it out, but we didn't know what we were doing, but it was a emerge just like a dream.

Speaker 1:          02:39          It was. So the terror of the future is a dream and his solution to the terror, the dream of the terror of the future is another dream. And it, it comes out in mythology and in fantasy and in drama where you act out the sacrifice and then it's a step on the way to full understanding. So we can say sacrifice instead of doing it, you know, although we still do it, it's just not concretized like it used to be. We do abstractly and we all have faith that it will work, you know, and we also set up our society so that it'll work. And one thing about, you know, I'm not a fan of moral relativism for a variety of reasons, partly because I think it's an, it's an extreme form of cowardice. But anyways, apart from that, no, no, no, no. There's minimal ways that you can set up a society that will work and so one of them is, is that the society has to be set up so that your sacrifices will pay off or you won't work, and then the society will die.

Speaker 1:          03:39          And so it has to make promises. People have to make promises to one another. And that's what money is. Money is a promise that your sacrifice will pay off in the future. That's what money is. And so if the society is stable, you can store up your work right now. You can sacrifice your impulses and you can work and you can store up credit for the future and then you can make the future a better place, but society has to be stable enough to allow for that. Hyperinflation will do you in. So the promise that's implicit in the currency is the promise that what you're doing now will pay off in the future, and if people don't have that promise, then what? We know what they do because in in gangs for example, and say gangs in North America, the time horizon of the gang members shrinks rapidly because they don't really expect to be alive much past 21.

Speaker 1:          04:30          And so they get really impulsive and violent and like, why the hell not? That's what you do when, when the future doesn't matter, when it's not real, you default back to living in the moment and you take what you can get right now and no wonder because you don't know if you're going to be around in a in a year and you get whatever you can. Well you can bloody well get it and that's like anarchy that state. And so you don't want to live in, some people like to live in that state because they're really wired for that, you know, and so they're much more comfortable in those conditions. They're, they're kind of like warrior types, I would say in some sense. But you know, for most people that's just where that stress will just do 10, you know, the stress of a life like that. So.
