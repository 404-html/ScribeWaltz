Speaker 1:          00:00          Fully believed that the fundamental myth of the human being was the myth and the myth from a broader perspective is a failed hero's story, so the eatable myth is the myth of a man who develops who grows up, but then accidentally becomes too close to his mother, sleeps with her, he doesn't know who she is, and as a consequence blinds himself and there's a. there's a, there's a warning about human development going wrong in that story and I think that Freud put his finger on it extraordinarily well because human beings have a very long period of dependency and one of the things that you do see in clinical practice is that many people's problems are associated with their inability to break free of their family, like they're consumed by the family drama, right? They can't get beyond what happened to them in their family. They're stuck in the past.

Speaker 1:          00:58          It's, and that's, that's equivalent symbolically speaking, you might say to the idea of being too close to your mother of, of, of the boundaries being improperly specified, and that happens far more often than anyone would like to think. As I said, for I thought it was a universal, but you see, he had a different idea and his idea was that it wasn't the failed hero story that was the universal human myth. It was the successful hero's story. And that's a big difference. I could seriously a big difference because the successful hero story is member in sleeping beauty. You may remember this in the Disney movie, the evil queen traps the prince in a dungeon and she's not gonna let them out till he's old. Right? And so there's this comical scene where she's down in the dungeon, he's all in chains and she's laughing at him, telling him what his future is going to be like.

Speaker 1:          01:53          She's quite evil and you know, she, she paints this wonderful picture of him being freed in like 80 years and hobbling out of the castle on his, his horse that's so old, he can barely stand up in him with gray hair. And, and you know, she, she recites this story of his eventual triumphant departure from the castle as a old and decrepit man. And she has a great laugh about it and it's nice. You know, it's a real punchy story. It's really something wonderful for children, that story and um, he gets free of the, of the shackles and the things that freedom or three little female ferries, the positive aspect of the feminine that frees him from the dungeon. It's so. It's very interesting and very accurate from a psychological perspective. It's the negative element of the feminine that encapsulates him in the dungeon and it's the positive element of the feminine that frees him.

Speaker 1:          02:46          And then he, he has a queen. The Evil Queen is not very happy when he escapes. You may remember that she stands on top of her castle tower and starts to spin off cosmic sparks. I mean, she's quite the creature in opt in flame and then she turns into a dragon and she then the prince has to fight with her in order to make contact with sleeping beauty and an awakened her from her comatose existence as her unconscious existence and a wants a brilliant. It's a brilliant representation of a successful hero myth. He, he doesn't end up staying in an unholy relationship with his mother. Let's say he escapes and then conquers the worst thing that can be imagined and is ennobled by that and that as a consequences able to wake the slumbering feminine from its coma and that's a union story and that's the story that he juxtaposed against Freud, Freud thought of religious phenomena as part of an old cult tide.

Speaker 1:          03:58          That would be, that would drown rationale rationality. That's why Freud was so valiantly antireligious and you thought, no, it's not the case. You're throwing the baby out with the bathwater. There's something profound and central to the hero myth and union clinical work is essentially the awakening of the hero myth in the in the analysis and in the in the client or the patient to conceptualize yourself as that which can confront chaos and triumph and that that's associated with an ennobling of the Sea of consciousness and the establishment of pop. Proper positive relationships between male and female. And you know, I'm a skeptical person. I'm a very, very skeptical person and I've tried with every trick. I have to put a lever underneath young story and lifted up and disrupt it and I. I can't do it. I think he was right and that Freud was wrong.

Speaker 1:          05:02          I mean, I have great respect for Freud. I think he got the progam problem diagnosed very, very nicely and in my clinical work, I see the phenomena that Freud described emerge continually, constantly that the best. If you're interested in that, there's a documentary you should watch. I may have mentioned it before. I think it's the best documentary ever made. Certainly the best one I've ever seen. It's called crumb and it's about a underground cartoonists. Robert Crumb, who, who was part of the hippie movement in, although he hated hippies, he was part of the hippie movement in, in the sixties, in San Francisco, and started the entire underground comic. What culture that that manifested itself eventually in, in graphic novels, there's quite a significant figure from the perspective of popular art and a very, very intelligent man and also I would say a hero, although a very bent and depraved and warped one.

Speaker 1:          05:57          Someone very acutely aware of his own shadow and the documentary outlines his attempts to escape from his absolutely dreadful mother and the failure of his two brothers to do the same thing, one of whom ended up as a street beggar in San Francisco and the other who drank furniture Polish and died six months after the documentary was produced. It's an unbelievably shocking documentary. It's the only piece of film that I've ever seen that captures Friday and pathology. I've never seen anything because he can't see it generally, unless you're in a clinical situation, unless you know the details of someone's lives, the personal intimate details, you cannot communicate it, but the documentary who made the film was Robert's way golf, if I remember correctly, was a friend of the crumbs and so he got access in a way that no one else would have and they're also very forthright and forthcoming about their situation in general.

Speaker 1:          06:53          I would highly recommend that it's. It's a real punch. If you want to know how a rapist thinks, like if you actually want to know because maybe you don't want to know. In fact, you probably don't want to know, right, because do you really want to know that? Because to understand that means to put yourself in that position and to understand it. If you really want to know how a serial sexual Predator thinks and why, if you watch crum and you pay attention, you'll know and that's only a tiny bit of what the film has to offer. It's really quite remarkable.
