Speaker 1:          00:00          People wish upon a star because they have some intuition that aiming above the mundane has the potential to transform themselves. They make a wish. Well, if you're gonna, make a wish. You should aim at something high and even just aiming at that is more likely to make the wish come true and this is not a metaphor. You know, I have this program which you guys are going to do called the future authoring program is one of two assignments. One is that you write an autobiography. That's the past authoring. The other is that you write a plan for the future. That's the future authoring. I would recommend that you get started on those right now, like not right now, but like really soon because they're harder than you think and some of you are going to write like 15,000 words. You're going to get sucked right in. This happens all the time. You're going to get sucked right into it and so you write an autobiography because you need to know where you are and who you are right now because how the hell are you going to plot a pathway to the future? Unless you know where you are and then you need to write about the future because you going to hit something unless he aim at it,

Speaker 1:          01:12          that's for sure. And lots of times people won't admit what they want because they're afraid. The reason they're afraid is because if you specify what you want, you've specified your conditions of failure. You know when you fail and it's better just to keep it foggy. It's like, well, I don't know if I'm succeeding or failing, but you know, I can't really tell while. Great. Except you can't hit anything you don't aim at. And so the future authoring program is like a, it's a, an attempt to have you articulate your character. And so as the past authoring program, who are you and you know, the past authoring program and asked you to break your life into the parks and then to write about the emotional, you know, the things that you regard as important important events that have shaped who you are and you know, you may find that some of those, some of that writing makes you emotional. I would say if you have a memory that's more than 18 months old roughly speaking, and when you bring it to mind it, it has an emotional impact, especially in negative emotional impact. There's. It's like part of your soul is stuck back there and I know that's a metaphorical way of thinking about it, but what I mean is that

Speaker 1:          02:24          the reason that you still experience the emotion is because you have not solved the problem that that situation face do with. It might be a real problem. Like maybe you got tangled up with someone who was really bad and that's rough man, because you got to come up with a theory of malevolence to deal with something like that and that's no joke, but if it's still produces emotion, it means you haven't solved the problem and and your. Your brain is still pegging it as threat. It's, it's a part of your territory that you did not master threat, threat, threat, threat, threat, and until you take it apart and articulation really helps, that writing really helps that then you're not going to free yourself from its grip and that what might not be that pleasant. I mean this is one of those situations were doing, it tends to produce a detriment in people's mood in the short term, but quite radical improvements, three to six months down the road, you know, and it's often the case that you unfortunately have to do something you don't want to do in order to progress.

Speaker 1:          03:24          It's very, very common. So in the future authoring program asks you about different dimensions of your life, like because you're, you know, you can think of yourself as a personality inside your head, but your nested in systems that transcend you and they're just as real as whatever's in your head. It's like, well, what do you need for life? Well, that's pretty easy actually. Some friends, that's a good thing. Intimate relationship, that's a good thing. Family, you know either the one you're going to produce or the one that you come from where people to some degree of love and care for one another. That's a good thing to work on. You need, you need some plan for your career. You've got to fit in somewhere that people regard as important and that they'll trade with you so that you can live. You need something worthwhile to do with the time that you're not at work and you need to pay attention to your mental and physical health and you need to regulate your use of substances, which is a strange one, but alcohol does lots of people in so it's worth.

Speaker 1:          04:31          It's worth thinking about. That's why we put it in there, so then it's like, okay, what the hell do you want? What do you want from your friends? What do you want from your family? What do you want from your career? If you could have what you want to. That's what the program asks you. Three to five years down the road, you get to have what you want. Now I'm assuming that you're going to approach this like, you know, reasonable adults and not like 13 year old dreamers. I think I want the most expensive yacht in the world. It's like fine, but you know, that isn't really what it's supposed to be more concentrating on your character and so then it asks you to write for 15 minutes without thinking too much about grammar or sentence structure. Any of that, but what your life could be like three to five years down the road if you were treating yourself like someone you cared for and you were helping them figure out what they wanted and then it asks you to do the same thing in reverse, which is to think about the ways that you're radically insufficient and your faults and everyone knows this.

Speaker 1:          05:40          I think, you know, maybe not, but everyone has a sense of if they were going to degenerate, how they would do it. You know, some people would be an alcoholic, some people would be a street person. It's like there's some doom thing out there that's got your name on it. If you're particularly in cautious and you know, don't. And let things fall apart, so want you to write about that. What do you not want to have happened in three to five years? And there's psychological reasons for this. A one is if you have something to aim for, that's a source of positive emotion because your positive emotion is mostly generated by evidence that you're moving towards something that you value. It's not generated so much by accomplishing something because when you accomplish something, you're just left with the problem of whatever you're going to do next.

Speaker 1:          06:27          So you graduate from university. It's like, you know, Hooray. One day you're at the peak of your undergraduate university career. The next day you're unemployed and looking for a bad job at starbucks. So, you know, well you see what I mean is, you know, it's, it's that, you know, one problem that you solve is replaced by another problem. And so the idea that you're going to be happy when you solve all your problems, it's like good luck with that theory. But, but you know, if you're aiming at something worthwhile and you really believe it's worthwhile and you've thought it through, you know, so that you're not weak, you're not weak, you've got your damn arguments, my mustard. Then when you make progress even a little bit, you think, hey, that's all right, and you get a little kick, a little dopamine kick, and that's what you want because that's where your positive emotion comes from.

Speaker 1:          07:15          You can use cocaine if you want, but, but you know, that tends to have relatively detrimental medium to longterm consequences, but it activates the same system. So you have to be aiming at something and you should be aiming at something that's realistic that you want, that you could get, you know, like, not easily because if it's easy, in some sense you've already got it. It's got to push you. And that's part of the pleasure actually, because there's two things that you want to do when you're pursuing something that's important and one of them is to get the thing that's important. But the other is, is to make yourself better at pursuing things. Right? So, so you can get both of those at the same time you, you, you're aiming at something and you're increasing your competence. It's like that's a good deal. That's a good deal and there's a lot of intrinsic meaning to be felt in that and then the second half of the program you, you write out a plan for how you're going to do it and how you're going to keep yourself on track and you're going to write about why it would be good for you if you did this and why it would be good for your family and what possible benefits it would have to the community because you want to nail this thing down and then you want to figure out what kind of obstacles are going to come up and how you might overcome them and how you might keep yourself on track and all of that.

Speaker 1:          08:32          And we know because we've actually done a lot of research on this particular program that if university students do this and this is more true. If they're not too well oriented to begin with. If University students do this, they're about 25 percent less likely to drop out, which is lot and about their grade point average increases about 20 percent. So Hooray for that, you know, because you never know when you develop an intervention, if it's gonna work, there's also evidence but not from my lab. That doing such things improves your physical health and I think the reason for that is that, you know, when you go over your autobiography and you scour out those negative places that you're sort of dragging along with you, it lowers your overall stress load because your brain is kinda. I think it's calculating how dangerous the world is by attending to the ratio of successes to failures that you've had in your life. Something like that. And so you know, if there are holes in your map that you could still fall through, then your brain regards the territory still as a bit on the dangerous side and then you more prepared for emergency action and that's hard on you. So you want to go back there and fix up those experiences is to the degree that you can't.
