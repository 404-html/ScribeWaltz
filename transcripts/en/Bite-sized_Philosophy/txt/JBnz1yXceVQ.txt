Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay, so it's in the 19 twenties. It's after the world. After World War One rushes in pretty bad shape. The villages are full of brutalized men who have posttraumatic stress disorder and lots of people who are not doing well at all and the bloody intellectuals come into the town and they say, you know, those successful farmers up the street that you've always been pretty jealous about in your useless manner while they're actually pigs and demons who are stealing from you, so why don't you come out, we'll form a nice little mob and we'll take everything they've got. And that's exactly what happened. And all those people were killed or raped or set off to Siberia in the middle of the bloody winter where there wasn't even anything for them to to anywhere for them to live or anything for them to eat. So they all died. And then the consequence of that was a few years later, 6 million people starved to death in the Ukraine.

Speaker 1:          00:48          And Malcolm Muggeridge had been reporting on that since the 19 thirties. And so that was the. That was the first wind really that the west God of exactly what was happening in the Soviet Union, but even at that point, that bloody left wing intellectuals in North America, we're so damn clueless and in Europe that they never paid much attention to it with, with the exception of certain number of people like George Orwell, who wrote 1984 and animal farm, which is of course a discussion. The main pig in animal farm is stalad and of course, and it's a story, an allegory about the Russian revolution whose basic motif is we're all equal, but of course some all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others and that's the motif. That's the Motif of animal farm. So there had been warnings all the way through, right from the beginning of the Russian revolution to the West about exactly what was going on.

Speaker 1:          01:40          But because Communist and Marxist ideology is very good at Adelaide and the at the week binds of idiot intellectuals, there was a huge section of the population who was fomenting, I suppose, against the standard. What would you call it? Political, psychological and social order. Who were absolutely committed to the ethic that's encased in statements like from each according to his ability to each according to his need, which sounds perfectly wonderful if you think about it for about 15 seconds, but if you think about it for six months, becomes unbelievably murderous and its reach and, and, and the intent. And so anyways, the French for whatever reason, seem to be particularly opaque to reason. I'll give you an example. So, um, the doctrine of Pol Pot in Cambodia that also killed about 6 million people hit. So what they did in Cambodia, once the revolution occurred was decided that everyone in the city were parasites on the countryside because the countryside full of farmers was where the primary production was taking place.

Speaker 1:          02:40          And they regarded the city dwellers as parasites on that fundamental production. So they basically emptied out the cities and set, sent all the people in the cities out to work in the country as forced labor. And 6 million people died there. And the chief architect of that bloody project got his phd from the Sorbonne and said exactly what he was going to do when he went back to Cambodia, was cheered along by the French intellectuals who thought that that was just a fine idea. So that's all background for why I don't think any of you guys really know much about 20th century history. So anyways, what happened in the 19 seventies when when Soulja Nansen published the Gulag archipelago was the. It was so brilliant, the book and so overwhelming and it's emotional and intellectual and historical power that it became impossible for anyone to continue to claim that Marxism slash communism had any intellectual or ethical integrity whatsoever.

Speaker 1:          03:39          It was done, it was done. And that's part of the reason why he won the Nobel Prize. And part of the reason, by the way, why the Soviet Union collapsed because once word got out about exactly what was actually going on, there was no way of making a coherent argument in favor of say, exporting the Worker's revolution around the world. It's like the consequence of that was well documented by social units and seeing the western intellectuals tried to make excuses for what had happened in the Soviet Union by blaming it on Stalin's cult of personality, perversion of the original accurate Marxist doctrine, so they basically said, well, Lenin had Lenin lived because he died quite young and was replaced by Stella. Had Lenin lived. The promised Utopia would have been delivered, but solzhenitsyn being an absolute genius, documented the relationship number one be between the axioms of Marxist and communist thought and the laws that were generated primarily by Lenin and the and the construction of these camps and the Dea Kula, causation and all the mass murders.

Speaker 1:          04:44          He documented the causal relationship between them and laid them clearly at the feet, not of Stalin but of Lenin. And so that was also a major blow because it. It undermined the remaining argument of the left wing radical left wing apologists in, in, in the West for the, for the viability of Marxist slash communist doctrines. And you still hear people today. Many people, when they're faced with the, you know, if they're, if they're, if they're Marxist in their orientation and they're faced with the data pertaining to what happened in the Soviet Union, they'll say something like, well, that wasn't real Marxism, but one of the things that you might answer to that is, well, fine, except that in every bloody country in the world where that doctrine was implemented, new, regardless of the wide cultural differences between the cultures, say the Soviet Union, China, Cambodia and so forth. Exactly the same thing happened every time.

Speaker 1:          05:37          And we still have a great example of that today in the form of North Korea. I don't know if you've ever looked at a map of the world at night. You know, you can get a map of the entire globe at night. You look at South Korea, it's lit up like jewels. It's nothing but light like the east coast of the United States and Canada and North Korea is dark, and the reason for that is that 50, 60 years of barbaric communist despotic rule means a country that's completely in an industrialized where every single person is malnourished or starving to death, where everyone lives in terror all the time and where there's nothing but the continual production of labor in labor camps just like in the Soviet Union in Mao's, China. So if we were willing to pay attention, we could still see examples of that today. And that's not an anomaly. North Korea is exactly what you'd expect given the doctrines upon which it's founded.
