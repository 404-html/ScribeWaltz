Speaker 1:          00:00          How much trouble would you want there not to be? It's a weird question, right? Because you want to have something to contend with. You want to have something that that forces from you the best that you have, and so you have to have real problems. Something like that. Would you dispense with all your real. You could just lay down on a bed and have pablum infused into your mouth. You know if all your problems were solved and so maybe you want difficult problems that you can solve. Something like that because there's some. I don't know what it is about it. There's A. There's the overcoming and the and the growth that comes along with that. There's something about the nobility of the enterprise. You certainly see that when you go about having children, for example, which is, you know, the psychological literature is quite clear if, if you do moment to moment comparisons of people who have kids and people who don't have kids, the people who don't have kids are happier and so psychologists who tend to get things wrong, even when they make intelligent discoveries like that one, immediately some of them jumped to the conclusion that because happiness is the goal, that while there's something about children that make you unhappy and that's not good, it's like, well, wait a second, and maybe that's the wrong metric.

Speaker 1:          01:08          It's like, of course you're less happy once you have children because you have to worry about them. You know, my neighbor down the street who's very smart woman said to me once, you can only be as happy as your unhappiest child, which I thought was really good. You know, that's really smart, but then it isn't. Well, it's having children doesn't make you happy. The answer isn't, don't have children. It's like, don't be so stupid about being happy. That's the answer. It's because there's a nobility in the pursuit, right? And of course now you're responsible, you know you have a new baby. You think especially if you're a new parent, you think, what the hell is this and what am I gonna do with it? You know, it's like, and then you're, you're done for the rest of your life. You never sleep properly again because you're going to be worried about this creature that you have to take care of it, but like, what the hell good are you?

Speaker 1:          01:55          If you're not doing that or something else equally difficult because you just, you just have been called out yet. Unless you take on a responsibility like that, the idea that life is that happiness is the purpose of life. It's like great for happiness, man. If it comes along, you should be thrilled that it's visiting you, but the notion that that's, that that's what you should pursue. That's, that's the weakest possible notion. First of all, as soon as something terrible happens to you, you're done. It's like life is to be happy. It's like, well, now you have cancer, so how's that? How's the happiness thing? Work it out for you now, or maybe it's not you. You know, maybe it's your father that has Alzheimer's disease or some damn thing and you know it's like it's a rare person that doesn't have some catastrophe. One, one person away from them.

Speaker 1:          02:44          It's like life is to be happy. It's that's not right, and we can at least derive that from these stories. That isn't what they say at all. God's perfectly happy in the stories to grant the people with whom he forms a covenant happiness and prosperity, but there's never a word that that's the purpose. The rule is aim high and get your bloody act together. That's the rule and establish this contractual covenant with the ultimate ideal and that will see you through the catastrophes and that's a much more mature way of looking at life as far as I'm concerned because all you have to do is have your eyes half open and you see that the fundamental reality of life is tragedy and suffering. There's that's inescapable. The quest. That doesn't mean that it. It makes life unbearable or that it makes being something that shouldn't have existed, right?

Speaker 1:          03:31          That isn't what it means, but it means that you have to contend with it and you have to get ready and the willingness to adopt responsibility for yourself and for others is, is the precondition for that. And then maybe if you do that properly, then now and then you get some happiness. You know, you can sit at the end of the day and you have half an hour where your conscience is clear and there's nothing that you need to be doing and you can relax and think, you know, that that's all right. Things are okay and thank God for that. And that's, that's maybe where you get your happiness. So that's something that's growing up, man, obviously, and, and to not know that and to not be taught that, like everyone should be taught that it's so obvious.
