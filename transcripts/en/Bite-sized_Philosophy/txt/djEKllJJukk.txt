Speaker 1:          00:00          Now you've got these two evil creatures here at Fox and the cat. I think this one's based on one of the Marx brothers, actually Harpo Marx, who I believe, never said anything but be that as it may, there are these Ne'er do well characters on the Fox in particular. Now Fox is a standard trickster animal, right? It's a, it's a, it's, it's, it's a classic animal. Maybe because it's, it's good at hiding and it's good at hunting. I don't know exactly why, but it's an coyotes are like that too. They're classic trickster animals. Um, he's Kinda like Wiley Coyote, in fact, you know, the, the warner brothers character who's a genius at large and of course whose arrogance continually gets him walloped and this character has a lot of features like that, but he, he's, he feigns being, uh, an English gentleman of like the 18 nineties and pretends to be educated and, and, uh, it has our kind of high blown way of talking and he's a fraud through and through.

Speaker 1:          00:59          And he's got, he's got this, you know, sidekick who is barely there at all and he, he doesn't treat him that well, but he's got someone to Lord it over. So that keeps his dominance hierarchy thing going well. And the fact that he's like a second rate companion while he never really noticed is that although he'll treat them contemptuously whenever he gets the chats. So anyways, they're walking down the street and uh, the, uh, Fox is bragging about some crooked thing that he's done and how he pulled the wool over someone's eyes. And he confuses that with a wisdom and intelligence. And one of the things that you see this is worth knowing too, because if you're preyed upon by a psychopath, which you will be to some degree at some point in your life, the psychopath who will be narcissistic will presume that you're stupid and, and, and that you deserve to be taken advantage of because you're naive and stupid.

Speaker 1:          01:53          So it's actually a good thing that he's doing it. And, uh, he, his proof for, and I'm saying he because there are more male psychopaths, um, the, uh, the proof that you're stupid naive is that he can take advantage of you. And so like if you were wiser you, you'd be, you know, you'd, you'd know his tricks and then it wouldn't be morally necessary for him to show you just exactly who knows what about what. And so the psychopath will use his ability to fool you as proof of his own grandiose, grandiose omnipotence, omniscience and narcissism. And the problem with that is that you can be fooled by a psychopath and virtually anybody can. So that Robert Hare, for example, who studied psychopaths for a long time and interviewed a lot of them, like hundreds of them and videotape many of the interviews he said when he was talking to the psychopath, he always believed what they were saying.

Speaker 1:          02:47          And then he'd watched the video afterwards and see where the conversation went off the rails. But you know, the pro, the proclivity to be polite in a conversation is very. And if you're polite, you don't object to the way that the person unfolds their strategy, you know, and psychopaths are pretty good at figuring out how to manipulate obviously how to manipulate people and the probability that you will be immune to that is extraordinarily low. Go Watch Paul Bernardo being interviewed by policemen on, on Youtube. That's bloody, that's enlightening man. Paul Bernardo, he's like the CEO of a meeting in that video, you know, it gives the cops hell. It gives the lawyers hell protested his innocence. He basically tells them that they're rude and untrustworthy because they don't trust him because he did a few little things 17 years ago and he gets away with it. A few little things, right?

Speaker 1:          03:41          I mean, he killed a bunch of people, including the sister of his girlfriend at the time and you know, he was a repeat sexual offender and murderer. It's. But he basically goes, well, you know, that's a long time ago. It's like we're, we're past that, aren't we? I mean, I'm having a discussion with you. I'm trying to solve help you solve some crimes, which by the way I committed, but we won't bring that up, you know, and you're, you're, you're accusing me of being a liar, like you're not playing fair, what's up with you? And then when they answer, he looks at his fingernails, which is like, that's a lovely little manipulative thing because it basically means whatever happens to be under my fingernail at the moment is much higher priority than listening to your foolish story and you watch, you'll see people do that to you and then you get a little insight into what they're up to.

Speaker 1:          04:24          He's very good at that. And so, or he looks outside or are you just looked at his hands and he looks out the window immediately. Dismissive in his nonverbal behavior. It's brilliant that the courts were forced to release that by the way, but look it up, Paul Bernardo on Youtube. Wow. It's, it's just mind boggling. It's, he's so good at what he does and he's good looking and he's charismatic and you know, he can really pull it off and you can't tell what's happening with the cops. And the lawyers, whether they're just letting them play as a routine to get some information from him or whether he's actually setting them back on his heels. And I suspect it's a bit of both, but it's a masterful performance. If you didn't know who he was and you were watching it without the audio, you'd think he's the CEO of some company given its employees hell for not being up to scratch. That's all his body language, his eye contact, everything just speaks that it's amazing.
