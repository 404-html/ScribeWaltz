Speaker 1:          00:00          Endosteal eskies book, Crime and punishment. He has his main character. [inaudible] cove decides that he's going to commit a murder and he has very good justification for the murder. And Dostoevsky is very good at this. He, he puts his characters into very, very difficult moral situations and gives them full justification for pursuing the, the,

Speaker 1:          00:33          pursuing the pathway that they're pursuing. And so [inaudible] cove, he's broke and starving. He wants to go to law school. His sister's about to prostitute herself rough, roughly speaking by marrying a guy that hates her, that she hates and that, and he has contempt for her, at least acts in that manner. He's trying to rescue his mother as well, who's also in dire financial straits. He, he, he, he goes to a pawnbroker to pawn his meager position so that he can continue to scrape by. And she has this nice, uh, I believe it's her niece that's not very bright, who she basically treats us as a slave in his horrible too. And, and so the care, the pawn broker has this money risk. All Niqab is in dire need. He thinks, look, I'll just killer because why the hell not? I'll take her money. She's not doing any good with it anyways.

Speaker 1:          01:23          I'll free or niece who's just working as a slave. She's got all these other people tangled up in her pawnbroker schemes. All that will happen is the world will be a better place and the only thing that's holding me back is conventional. Moral cowardice and Dostoevsky has his character in crime and punishment go through days, hours, hours and days and weeks of intense imagination about this rationalization, about this, trying to justify himself, placing a metal outside, placing him self outside the law so that he can perpetrate this act and telling him self with all the best nihilistic arguments that the only possible thing that could be holding them back is an arbitrary sense of indoctrinated morality and so dusty Esky explorers that he does commit the murder and then of course all hell breaks loose because things don't necessarily turn out the way that you want.

Speaker 1:          02:15          He gets away with it. However, while he gets away with a technically because no one knows he did it, but he doesn't get away with it in relationship to his own conscience and so that the rest of the book explores that well, Dostoevsky, I believe it was in crime and punishment, although he makes the same point in many of his books. He makes a very fundamental point and this is the kind of point that that I think that people who haven't investigated these matters down this particularly particular literary and philosophical pathway, never grappled with Dostoevsky, said straightforwardly if there's no god, so if there's no higher value, let's say if there's no transcendent value, then you can do whatever you want and that's the question that he's investigating. You see, this is why I have such frustration say with people like Sam Harris, this sort of radical atheists because they seem to think that once human beings abandoned their, their grounding in the transcendent, that the, the plausible way forward is with a kind of purest rationality that automatically attributes to other people equivalent value.

Speaker 1:          03:20          It's like I just don't understand that. If they believe that that's the rational pathway, what the hell is irrational about me getting exactly what I want from every one of you whenever I wanted at every possible second, why is that are irrational and how possibly is that more irrational than us cooperating so we can both have a good time of it. I don't understand that. I mean it's as if the psychopathic tendency is irrational. There's nothing irrational about it. It's pure naked self interest. How is that irrational? I don't understand that. Where? Where's the pathway from rationality to to an egalitarianism virtue. Why the hell not every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost? It's a perfectly coherent philosophy and is actually one that you can institute in the world with a fair bit of material success if you want to do it so I don't see.

Speaker 1:          04:15          To me, I think that that the universe that people like Dorkins and Harris inhabit is so intensely conditioned by mythological presuppositions that they take for granted. The ethic that emerges out of that as if it's just a given, a rational given, and this of course precisely niches, observation as well as Dostoyevsky's. That's Nietzsche's observation. You don't get it. The ethic that you think is normative is a consequence of its of its of its nesting inside this tremendously lengthy history, much of which was expressed in mythological formulation. You wipe that out. You don't get to keep all the presuppositions and just assume that they're rationally axiomatic there. The rational to make a rational argument, you have to start with an initial proposition. While the proposition that underlies western culture is that there's a transcendent morality. Now you can say, that's a transcendent morality instantiated in the figure of God. That's fine. You can even call that a personification of the morality if you want to, if you. If you don't want to move into a metaphysical space. I'm not arguing for the existence of God. I'm arguing that the ethic that drives our culture is predicated on the idea of God and that you can't just take that idea away and expect the thing to remain intact midair without any foundational support.
