Speaker 1:          00:00          What should move forward in time with me and what should be let go as if it's dead wood and the more dead wood that you let go of and burn off when you have the opportunity. The last it accretes around you here. Here's something interesting about forest fires. You know people have been trying to prevent forest fires for a long time, especially that am bear smokey, right? He's trying to prevent forest fires and so because forest fires burn up the forest and that can't be good, but here's what happens if you don't let forest fires burned, is that while forests collect a lot of dry branches, right? Because tree branches die and would falls on the forest floor and collects and so the amount of flammable material keeps increasing with time and that's not so bad if it's wet, but if the amount of flammable material is increasing and it gets really dry and then it burns, then you have a real problem.

Speaker 1:          00:57          The forest fire can burn so hot that it burns route, topsoil right off, in which case you don't have a forest at all anymore. You just have a desert and low. Lots of trees are evolved to withstand forest fires, have a certain intensity and some won't even release their seeds unless there's been a fire and so a little bit of fire at the right time can stop everything from burning to the ground, and that's also a really useful insight, a metaphorical insight into the nature of sacrifice, right? It's also a lot easier to let go of something when you're deciding to let go of it because you've decided yourself that you're done with that. It's a weak part of you. It needs to disappear. You do that yourself. It's much better and much easier than it is if it's taken away from you forcibly, in which case you're very much likely to fight it.

Speaker 1:          01:48          These other. There's another interesting thing here, a motif that runs through the entire Bible. It's a very, very powerful motif and it's partly associated with this idea of walking with or walking before God and in the New Testament, Christ says something like, my father's will be done and he means that that will should be done through him, and so I can't. I won't be able to state this exactly right, but it's something like this, you know, a lot of what people regard as their own personalities and and are proud of about their own personalities, aren't their own personalities at all. They're useless idiosyncrasies that defer them, differentiate them trivially from other people, but they have no value in and of themselves. They're more like quirks. I remember once I was trying to teach a particularly stubborn student about how to write and she had written a number of essays in university and got universally walloped for them and the reason for that was she couldn't write really at all. She was really, really bad at writing and so I was sitting down with her trying to explain to her what she was doing wrong and she was being very annoying about it. Very recalcitrant, very, very unwilling to listen. That was a pearls before swine thing, you know, and at one point she said it did. I can write perfectly well, this university professors just don't like my style and I could feel my hands creep towards her neck.

Speaker 1:          03:24          Yeah, well maybe that'd be funny if it wasn't true, but it was also true, you know, and I thought what the Hell is with you? You can't even write and you think you have a style and not only do you. Yeah, no, not knowing how to write is not a style. That's the other point. Right. And so, you know, she, she instead of humbling herself, which was necessary and. Okay. Right, because she was a new university students, like of course you don't know how to write. When were you going to learn in school?

Speaker 2:          03:56          I think so.

Speaker 1:          04:03          So she had this, you know, this, this, this style issue in it. It just, it just didn't go anywhere at all. And so now, let's see, I lost my train of thought telling you, telling you all those jokes, don't we asked in terms of above letting things burn off. Yeah. Well, so she was proud of her insufficiency outs. Arrogance, right? That's not humility. It's self deception and arrogance to be proud of your insufficiency. That's a very foolish thing. And that means to cling to the parts of you that are dead. Okay? Now there's this idea that runs through the Bible, I think as a whole that.

Speaker 1:          04:42          Okay, I'll tell you another little side story here. I was reading about socrates today and I was reading about socrates trial, you know, he was tried by the Athenians for corrupting, for, for failing to worship the gods and corrupting the youth of Athens by like teaching them stuff and asking them questions, you know, which is great way to corrupt people. And so he knew the trial was coming and Athens wasn't a very big place in Atlanta, about 25,000 people. Everybody knew everybody. Everybody knew who the powerful guys were in everybody, including socrates, knew that the trial was a warning. Do like get out of town, right? So we're going to put you on trial in six months. And the potential penalty is death. God, that it's like. So. So socrates had a chat with his compatriots and they were contemplating fair means and foul to set up a defense for him so that he could or to leave so that he could not be tried and put to death.

Speaker 1:          05:42          And he decided that he wasn't going to do that and he also decided that he wasn't going to even think about his defense. And he said, why? This is quite an interesting thing. He said, why? He told one of his friends that he had this voice in his head, Damon the spirit, something like that, that he always listened to in that. That was one of the reasons he was different from other people because he always listened to this thing. It didn't tell him what to do, but it told him what not to do. It always told them what not to do and if it told them not to do something, then he didn't do it. If he was speaking and the little voice came up and said no. Then he shut up and he tried to say something else and he was very emphatic about this and he said that when he tried to plan to evade the trial or even to mount his own defense, the voice came up and said, no,

Speaker 1:          06:39          don't bother with it. And he thought, well, what? What the hell do you mean by that? Like there's a trial coming and I'm going to be put to death, and while he eventually concluded that he was an old guy in the next 10 years, he was in his seventies, perhaps the next 10 years weren't going to be that great forum. He got a chance, maybe the gods were giving them a chance just to bow out, you know, to put his inferiors in order to say goodbye to everyone to avoid that last descent into catastrophe, which might've been particularly painful for a philosopher and to and to walk off the world on his own terms, something like that. The point I'm making with that is socrates attended to this internal voice that at least told them what not to do and then he didn't do it. And of course socrates was a very remarkable man and we still hear about them today and we know that he existed and all of those things. And so back to the back to the walking with God idea. You know, as you elevate your aim,

Speaker 3:          07:46          you

Speaker 1:          07:47          create a judge at the same time. Right? Because the new ideal, which is an ideal you, even if it's just an ideal position that you might occupy, even if it's still conceptualized in that concrete way, that becomes a judge because it's above you, right? And then you're, you're terrified of it. Maybe that's why you might be afraid when you go start a new job, right? Because this thing is above you and you're terrified of it and, uh, judges you. And that's useful because the judge that you're creating by formulating the ideal tells you what's useless about yourself and then you can dispense with it and you wanted to keep doing that. And then every time you make a judge that's more elevated, then there's more useless you that has to be dispensed with. And then if you create an ultimate judge, which is what the archetypal imagination of humankind has done, say with the figure of Christ, because if Christ is nothing else, he is at least the archetypical perfect man.

Speaker 1:          08:40          And therefore the judge. You have a judge that says, get rid of everything about yourself that isn't perfect. Of course, that's also what Abraham. That's also what God tells Abraham, right? He says to be perfect, to pick on ideal that's high enough and you can do this. The thing that's interesting about this, I think as you can do it more or less on your own terms, you have to have some collaboration from other people, but you don't have to pick an external ideal. You can pick an ideal that fulfills the role of ideal for you. You can say, okay, well if things could be set up for me the way I need them to be and if I could be who I needed to be, what would that look like? And you can figure that out for yourself and then instantly you have a judge.

Speaker 1:          09:20          And I also think that's part of the reason people don't do it right? Why don't. Why don't people look up and move ahead and answer is, well, you know, you start formulating an ideal. You formulate a judge. It's pretty easy to feel intimidated in the face of your own ideal. That's what happens to cane versus able, for example. Then it's really easy to destroy the ideal instead of to try to pursue it because then you get rid of the judge, but it's way better lower the damn judge if it's too much like if your current ambition is crushing you, you know, then maybe you're playing the tyrant to yourself and you should tap down your ambitions, not get rid of them by any stretch of the imagination, but at least put the more reasonably within your grasp. You don't have to leap from point one to point 50 in one leap, right?

Speaker 1:          10:03          You can do it incrementally, but I really liked this idea. I think it's a profound idea that the process of recapitulating yourself continually is also the process of it's a phoenix like process, right? You're shedding all those elements of you that are no longer worthy of the pursuits that your that you're valuing, and then I would say the idea here is that as you do that, you shape yourself ever more precisely into something that can withstand the tragedy of life and that can act as a, as a beacon to the world. That's the right way of thinking about it, maybe first to your friends and then to your family. It's like it's a hell of a finance vision and there's no reason that it can't happen. You know, every one of you knows people who are really bloody useful in a crisis and people that you admire, right? Those are all you can think of. All those people, as you admire that you admire us partial incarnations of the archetypal Messiah. That's exactly right, and the more that that manifests itself at any given person, then the more generally useful and admirable that person is in a multitude of situations and we don't know the limit to that, but people can be unbelievably good for things. You know? It's really something to behold.
