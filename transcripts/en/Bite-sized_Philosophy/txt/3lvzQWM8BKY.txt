Speaker 1:          00:00          Obsessive compulsive disorder, so chronic handwashing for example, is this is as an anxiety disorder, but there is an anxiety component to it, but I don't believe that that's an accurate classification. I think that obsessive compulsive disorder is actually a disorder of disgust because all of the behaviors, including hyper grooming people sometimes have trichotillomania. They'll pull out the hairs on their body. The grooming behaviors and that sort of thing seemed to be more associated with the operation of the disgust system and almost everything about obsessive compulsive disorder has a disgust basis. And so one of the things that people who are who have ocd obsessive about is that I've got a client once who was this poor woman. By the time her ocd was done with her. She built the equivalent of an airlock on her house. Like not technically proficient or anything like that. And her husband and her children had to go through an elaborate decontamination process before they were allowed to step foot in the house.

Speaker 1:          00:53          And one of the things she was very concerned about was that she would go out to a supermarket and touch a piece of fruit. And, and become contaminated and then come home and touch her children and then they would become contaminated and so while she ended up in the hospital and she was divorced and I just did it in her life, you know, and so then people who have obsessive compulsive disorder, you know, they'll, they'll wash their hands until the soap is gone, like a whole bar of soap. Right. And you can often tell who they are because their hands are shiny from Washington much and they'll shower, it can't get out of the shower, they'll shower until the hot water is completely gone and you know, so the self cleaning mechanism so to speak, have gone seriously astray and the way you treat them as by exposing them to things that are disgusting and contaminating.

Speaker 1:          01:37          I had a client with ocd once, he was quite the character and I. One of the things I had him do was we would look for things on the Internet, pictures of things that really disgusted him. It's not that much fun by the way, treating someone who has ocd because I'm rather disgust sensitive. And so that was also rather hard on me, so anyways, we would look for things on the Internet that, that he really didn't like. And then I'd print them out and have him put him on his fridge, which he did not like at all. And he would, he would, he had a bunch of other problems and we got along quite well. But for a long time I treated him for about three years. He would phone me like three or four times a day because he had obsessive compulsive disorder and just swear at me like mad, you know, just swear it, it, get these messages.

Speaker 1:          02:20          He'd, he, he phoned me and he was just so mad at me because I'd have to put these things on his fridge, you know? And so he'd curse and swear and yell at me. And then two minutes later he would phone and apologize and say he was really sorry and helped. I would continue to see them. And God, that just went. I just went on forever. But I felt sorry for the poor guy. You know, he eventually ended up getting a puppy. You agreeable people. Oh, puppy God, God, unbelievable. A. Yeah. Anyways, that was good for him because he had to go around and clean up after the PA, PA, but that had poor puppy. It was quite dominant and had all the things that happened to that poor guy so the puppy would dominate him, so he'd take it outside to take it for a walk and he wasn't a very skilled person in many, many ways.

Speaker 1:          03:06          He had a very large number of severe impediments and so, but he really liked this pop. He didn't have any friends or anything like that and he was supported by his aged mother and God. It was just a catastrophe and he'd go outside and try to walk the puppy and the puppy would just sit down, right, because it was doing dominant stuff and he didn't know how to overcome it and then these crazy people from across the way who styled themselves as animal rights activists started to harass me and they phoned up his mother and told them that if they, if, if she didn't take the dog away from that retard, they were going to come over and do terrible things to him and then he got harassed on the street and then he went to a park with his dog and they came up to him and pushed him on the card and swiped his dog and ran off to the, to the SPCA and dumped it there and he had to move away from his apartment and God, it was just, it was just an absolute catastrophe.

Speaker 1:          03:57          They had plenty of sympathy for that damn dog, but no sympathy whatsoever for the guy, you know. It was really, it was really something. Anyways, that story ended happily. Weirdly enough. He got a. He got a job with a woman who used to be a psychiatric nurse who was training dogs and she gave him a little job setting up the dog training thing and then he got to learn to train his dog. He lost like he was a thin guy to begin with. He lost like 30 pounds trying to learn how to take care of this puppy. It was just. I thought he was gonna die, but there is no way he was going to give up that dog. And so anyways, OCD, it's quite the bloody catastrophe. So. And it's a good thing for someone who has ocd to have a dog, right? Because dogs are messy and so there's all sorts of things that are messy about them, but you have to kind of live with the mess. Like you have to live with the mass. If you're going to have a child or if you're going to have a partner of any sort, you know, you, you can't let the orderliness part of you get the upper hand so terribly that it's impossible for you to lift.
