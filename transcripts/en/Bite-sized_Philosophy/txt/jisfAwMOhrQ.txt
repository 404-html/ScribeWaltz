Speaker 1:          00:02          Here's, I love this cartoon, this is from a underground comic for, for people who smoke way too much marijuana and it's called a. These people are the fabulous furry freak brothers and they were created by Gilbert Shelton who was one of the first underground cartoonists and one of the least pathological ones with the best sense of humor and he writes these stories about these stupid hippies, three of them, the fabulous furry freak brothers. You see two of them there and all they do is smoke pot and avoid responsibility and and run away from the police and it, but, but it's a nice satire and so and they have this cat and the fat one fat Freddy has the cat and they're too lazy to even give her the cat in name. So it's fat Freddy's cat and it has its own adventure is mostly with like an army of cockroaches that that lives inside.

Speaker 1:          00:51          They're like horrible slummy hell hole of living place. And so anyways, it's quite comical. And so the, the hippies have stumbled across a small fortune and stoned out of their minds on cocaine. They go out to set up utopia in the countryside. They buy this terrible piece of property, but they're so diluted that they think it's like a mansion and they bring their cat and I don't know if you've ever had a cat, but cats don't like to move. It really bugs them and so they're not comfortable when you bring them to a new place. They're like the rat that's been taken out of its comfortable cage and put it into a new cage and the cat, you put a cat in a new room and it depending on the cat obviously, but generally they'll retreat into a corner and be and meow pityingly and be very unhappy for quite a substantial amount of time.

Speaker 1:          01:35          And so the cartoonist actually map this out quite nicely. So the hippie takes the cat out of the box and says our new home, it's, they're out in the forest. This is the never been cat. It's never been in the forest. It doesn't know what the hell is up in the forest. And the cat's looking rather dubiously and things. So this is the country and then it's put on the ground and it starts to slink as he says, slink, slink out into the forest. And that's actually what animals do. It's a, it's a predatory evasion crouch. And so if they're put in a new territory, they'll hunker down and freeze first and then they'll slowly unfreeze and start to explore. They sniff first and then they'll start to move it. But they do it like with trepidation and slowly and tried to hide it. So that's what the cat is doing and the cat goes out into the unknown, far enough sniffing and all of a sudden pow.

Speaker 1:          02:24          It goes underneath the house, just like the toddler running back to the mother and the other, another hippie there. Uh, I think that's fineas says, where'd the cat disappeared to now? And the fat ready character says under the house. And then accounts under there in the dark with big eyes looking terrified. Saying you'd hide too if you'd smelled what I did. And so what it smelled was this thing that has like the head of a wolf and a and a and antlers like a deer in the tail of a skunk and the feet of a like a chicken and horrible clause. It's like, well, what is that? Well, it's a monstrous amalgam of that which lurks in the unknown. And so the cartoonists, the comedian got it perfect, said, well, what is there? What is out in the unknown while you need one representation, not a thousand.

Speaker 1:          03:13          And so you take pieces of what's out there that are relevant and you create a single image out of that and you say, well, this is what's out there. And you might say, well no such animal as that exists, and that's actually incorrect. An animal, very much animals very much like that exists. It's just a superordinate low resolution category. It includes all those weird animals that might hurt you, that are out in the forest. That's a useful category, weird animals that might hurt you. And that's a real category. You might say, well, there's differentiated things within that category. It's like, yeah, every category has that nature. Can still be further differentiated, maybe not protons, you know, they could even be differentiated with regards to location at least. So every category can be further differentiated. The question is whether the category has some functional utility, or at least that's one of its questions. It's like that's the thing to be afraid of.
