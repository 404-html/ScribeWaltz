Speaker 1:          00:00          As another way of representing it, the dragon of chaos stands for the potential that surrounds us. Inside of that, there's the unknown, the unknown that you actually come into contact with, right? That's the unknown as it actually manifests itself in your world as something you don't understand, instead of just the potential for that, because we say, look, you know perfectly well that as you're sitting here, there's all sorts of things you don't know everywhere, but where are they? Well, they're not manifesting themselves at the moment. They're only in potential, but you could. We could have a discussion that that became argumentative and then all of a sudden it would be as if emissaries of that unknown had entered the space and that's the unknown that's defined in relationship to what you know. That's what you actually experienced. Instead of it only being potential. It's a tough thing to get because they're both unknown, right?

Speaker 1:          00:51          You think, well, how can there be two different categories of unknown while latent and manifest? That's a good way of thinking about it. You know, you in a relationship, it's going stable, but you know that sooner or later something will come up. Okay, op from where? Why? Up from beneath? Well, what do you mean beneath? While it's from. It's from your complex, the person you're in, a relationship with it in width is complicated and complex that's implicit in you. It's, it's inside your conceptual structure. That's, that's the way of looking at it now and then when there's a disagreement, it will manifest itself and you know that you know that they're still trouble brewing ahead, interrelationship always, and that's part of what keeps them alive.

Speaker 1:          01:38          The interesting piece of empirical work done on this awhile back, so you might think, well, what is the optimal relationship look like in terms of positive and negative emotion? You might say, well, Utopia, nothing but positive interactions. It's like no. Now imagine you get people to code the interactions they have with their partner during the day. You know, you sample it, you say, was that interaction positive or negative? And then what you're trying to do is predict the longevity of the relationship. Okay, so here's the data. If it falls under five positive interactions to one negative interaction, the relationship doesn't continue. Fair enough. Too much negative. That's easy to understand. If it exceeds 11 positive to one negative, the relationship doesn't last. Why?

Speaker 2:          02:24          No challenge,

Speaker 1:          02:26          right? What do you want from your partner? Bless. No, no, no. You don't. You want periods of peace punctuated by a good fight and that because that means you respect them, means you have something to offer each other and it means that you're both growing and so you don't want the fight to be too dramatic because, well then you retreat. You can't settle it, but the person that you can completely map and who only does positive things for you, it's like a. You don't know that person B, they're not communicating with you nor you with them. Maybe they're just subordinating themselves to you or you to them and you're not growing. You want someone who can. It's a real relationship is a wrestling match. It's a grappling, grappling phenomena that you both emerged, transformed from, and that's what people want. They don't want a pushover. Not Not unless there's something wrong with them, and when narcissistic person who never wants to be challenged will want a partner who does nothing but deliver exactly what they're told to deliver, but they will mistreat the beyond belief and perhaps deservedly so.
