Speaker 1:          00:00          So, um, in the past I've done some work with big brother, big sister and whatever. Um, that being said that the most common story I tend to hear from 50 youth is that they're raised in a single family home, usually with a mom, daddy's there on the picture and alcoholic, whatever, whatever they brought her. So we have this child who is trying to seek ways to make himself healthy and empower himself in ways that a healthy father should have done. So, you know, between the formative years of like one to four. So I think, you know, I'm going with this, um, how, let's say for someone who born without like a good father figure, where would they go out in the world and like what four spheres of influence where they try to expose themselves to, to like gain access to that Fountain of Health and knowledge at a father or a good father figure should have provide them to in the first place.

Speaker 2:          00:47          Okay. Well, partly, I mean certainly to some degree a good mother can provide that to some degree, although it's hard for one person to be everything right. You know? And I think one of the conundrums that face women, and this is a tough one, and this is why I think women are higher end trade agreeableness and higher in trait negative emotion, is that the primary problem that a woman has with an infant is why not throw it out a window because it's very annoying. I mean it's there all the time. It's constant demand. It's absolutely constantly man, tremendous dependency. And so a woman has to be tilted towards mercy. That's how it looks to me like. And especially during. It's so important during the. Especially the first year when children are so unbelievably vulnerable. And so I think it's very difficult for women to be merciful like that and to make the shift to encouraging disciplinary.

Speaker 2:          01:35          I think that's a very difficult thing for people to do simultaneously. Although you know, people, people. I'm not saying that women are always only merciful and men are always only encouraging disciplinarians, but things do sort themselves out to some degree like that. And I think also the biochemical transformations that accompany pregnancy and childbirth and lactation also killed a mother towards that as well because he has to really love that little thing. Right? It's, it's number one, no matter what it demands and then telling it what to do and making sure it's behaving properly. That's, that's a whole different issue now. But the kids who lack fathers, I mean, first of all, they can find that to some degree in their friends and that's often what father this boys do in particular. They, they, they go into gangs and they generate the missing men masculinity and the game.

Speaker 2:          02:22          Well that's not so good because like what the hell do they know that? Well, they don't know anything, right? They're just stupid kids and they're like 15 years old and their testosterone is pumping and they're trying to get the hell away from their mother, which is what they're supposed to do. And they're not in the right position to exercise authority over themselves. So that's not good. They can find it in education, they can find it in books, they can find it. Movies, they can find it in sports heroes and so forth because the image of the father is fragmented and distributed among the community, but it's very, very difficult to not have a father and you know, one of the things that we're doing in our society, which I think is. I think it's absolutely is that we're making the case that all families are equal.

Speaker 2:          03:03          It's like, sorry, no wrong. There's no empirical data supporting that proposition. By the way. It's much better for kids to have two parents who those parents are. That's a whole different issue, but if I could just one more thing. Oh, how would you ask that question too? Let's see. A daughter who was raised by a father because she would obviously have different ways of find those fragments of her missing father then like a boy would instead because obviously they're raised differently or at least they should have been. Well, I think it's the same issue, you know? I mean, I think. I think that another danger that emerges, Mrs [inaudible] of course famous observation is that you know, if there's mom and child or father and child, that relationship can get a little closer than it should and then the lines get blurry and mixed and I'm not saying that that happens to everyone obviously, but, but it's still a danger that that's inherent in the situation.

Speaker 2:          03:51          They're were thrust together too tightly without sufficient resources and so the responsibility has to be distributed more and like I really do think that it's the sign of the degeneration of the society when the, when, when single parenthood becomes anything approximating the norm, it's not a good idea. Then the. I'm part of the reason I believe that and I think this has to do with the overwhelming selfishness of, of, of modern life is that marriage isn't for the people who were married. It's for the children obviously, and like if you can't handle that, grow the hell up Sarah. I mean, seriously.

Speaker 3:          04:29          Yeah. Seriously. Once you, once you have kids,

Speaker 2:          04:35          yes. It is not about you, period. Now, that doesn't mean it isn't about you at all, but it just seems so self evident to me. I can't believe that anybody would even would even question it. Oh, let's. Oh yes. Well, I'm certainly aware of that. Yes. It's questioned. It's almost illegal to question it now, you know, to, to or illegal to make the set of propositions that I make, so that's the best I can do. That's excellent. Thank you.
