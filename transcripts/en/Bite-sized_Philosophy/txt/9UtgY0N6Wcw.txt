Speaker 1:          00:00          The Soviets, given their idea of class guilt, which sounds a lot like white privilege to me or any other form of racism,

Speaker 1:          00:11          they use that doctrine to just round up all the kulaks they were the productive farmers and ship them off to Siberia and then 6 million Ukrainian starved to death. But you know, they had too many Ukrainians anyway, so it didn't really matter. So anyways, back to the postmodern types. Well, you know, this all came was revealed in such painful detail that even the kind of closed minded idealogue that Norman referred to just quite, couldn't, couldn't quite muster up the moral courage to keep beating the same damn drum. So what they did instead being highly intelligent individuals, was play a game of sleight of hand and transformed these Marxist presuppositions into postmodernism in the 19 seventies. And the idea basically was, well, the working class isn't going to rise up and crushed the bourgeoisie because first of all they're getting rich and that wasn't supposed to happen. And second, well it sort of seemed to be a catastrophe when that occurred, let's say in Russia. And so maybe we won't do that anymore because the working class actually isn't buying into this either, which is also a problem, you know, having internalized their own oppression, they wouldn't buy into this, to the global myth of Utopia. So maybe it's because they've had some sense. It's certainly possible. But anyways, the slight of hand was, oh, well fine, we'll just play a different one. Oppressor versus oppressed game and we'll introduce identity politics.

Speaker 1:          01:33          It's like, okay, okay, you're not being oppressed because of you're a member of the working class. You're being oppressed because you're a woman or you're being oppressed because you have an ethnicity that's outside the main paradigm, whatever that might be. Um, or it's because of your, your, your, your sexual preference or your sexual identity or whatever. Whatever places you in some manner outside the normative culture. You know, the thing is the postmodernist, you know, you might think, well, your culture is good for something. It gives you a hierarchy of value. It rewards competent people, it gives you a direction so you can climb up, you know, because otherwise everything's leveled to nothing. And then why do anything? They don't care about any of that. They don't believe that there's any such thing as competence. They don't believe that there's any such thing as up. This is all postmodernism wipes, all of that out.

Speaker 1:          02:20          And so when the postmodernists analyze the text, all they care about is how it privileges the position of the author and who had impresses. And that's the only thing they regard as real. And they don't believe in grand unifying narratives. They don't believe that there's a Canadian identity. They don't believe that there's an American identity. They don't believe that there is a western identity. They don't believe that value structures exist, or if they are, they're replaceable with some other value structure. They certainly don't believe that they have any biological grounding. That there's any such thing as a human being. It's all socially constructed, which is really convenient. If what you want to do is be the author of an entirely social constructed you utopia that you can run.
