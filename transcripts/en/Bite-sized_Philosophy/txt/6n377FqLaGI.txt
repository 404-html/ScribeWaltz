Speaker 1:          00:00          You know if you listen to a complex piece of music or at least this is my experience with complex music is sometimes the first time I hear it. I don't really like it and I don't I don't. I think I also don't understand it. I actually can't hear it. You know maybe a musical genius could hear the whole thing instantly you know say Franz Liszt. They say he could sight read anything on the piano first try. So you know some people are so intelligent musically that it's incomprehensible and I'm sure they hear things just fine the first time they hear them but then what happens for me is that if I listen to it a couple more times there are pieces chunks of it that start to fall into place that I can follow. And you know I can see the beauty sort of shining through those and then eventually the whole thing.

Speaker 1:          00:44          Leaks together and then I can listen to it especially if it's a complete black piece of music. Many many many times. And the more complex and probably the better. The piece of music the more I can listen to it but if I listen to it enough at some point then I've had enough of it and it's all very strange phenomena. Because one of the things you might ask yourself is What exactly are you learning while you're doing that. You're you know it seems like you want the music it's something like you want the music to be. Just exactly the right amount of predictable and unpredictable and if it's too unpredictable then you can't understand it and if it's too predictable it's boring and so it's just like a conversation not way. It's actually just like life as well. Because you want things to be predictable and stable. And you want things to be unpredictable and interesting. And the degree to which you want each of those is going to depend on the time and the context. And also on your own intelligence and temperament. So.

Speaker 1:          01:42          Now I'm going to. Tell you a bunch of stories and give you a bunch of a number of pieces of information and. Hopefully they'll click together. Now I think the reason that this information is always being transmitted in story in image form is because it's very very difficult to transform it into articulated into fully articulated explanation. It isn't really how it works. No we're not really accustomed to thinking about the idea that there are certain forms of information that. And that that are valid forms of information that can't be transmitted verbally. Of course if you think about it we all understand this deeply because while I can give you a bunch of examples the first example is that when you speak not only do you speak in words and phrases in sentences and paragraphs but you also speak melodically and in fact part of the reason that you can understand melodies and that they make sense to you is that what artists have done is separated the melodic element of speech from the semantic element and then played with the melodic element and the melodic element tends to carry a lot of emotion and intent and soul.

Speaker 1:          02:51          If you're listening to someone speak you can tell when they're being ironic you know because they raised an eyebrow and their voice changes slightly even though they might be using in fact they are using exactly the same words and in fact someone who's very good at being witty or ironic will set the situation up so that you can barely tell that they're joking. And the better they are at that the. Time of year that they give you that you can still catch onto the funny or the situation is so. So we know that the information can be transmitted through non-verbal channels if it even happens during speech. And then of course we understand that music. Presents to us an intimation of meaning that's very difficult to fully grasp. And music for me has always been a ineffable phenomenon in some sense because. It carries the intimation of meaning in a manner that can't be rationally dismissed or that people are interested in rationally dismissing.

Speaker 1:          03:52          So even punk rock nihilists listen to punk rock nihilistic music and they know they find that meaningful even though they don't believe in meaning. And you know in some sense they're victims of their own rationality because they do believe in meaning or they wouldn't be listening to the music but they can't understand how they could possibly believe in it so their rational mind has dispensed with the idea. And sometimes that's people dispense with the idea of meaning for lots of reasons partly because of because it's inevitable in some sense with sufficient rationality but also because because it's always useful to look. For the. Underbelly of things because it also justifies not bearing any responsibility for your life and not fairly. What that can be a very desirable side effect of a particular ideological irrational belief. And then there's dance of course and dance is even more ineffable.

Speaker 1:          04:46          The music although it's often paired with music you know when it's and it it grips people if you see a remarkable dance performance. Well part of it is that you're sort of thrilled and excited about seeing just exactly what the human form can do. Because perhaps partly because you're human and when you see someone extending a certain ability far beyond the norm then it expands your sense of what a human being is capable of. So there so there's that there's just the pure steel element and then there's the novelty element because often if you watch a particularly good dancer there's things they do that you haven't seen before that you didn't know anyone could do and that's pretty fun and then often the dances. Is joined with the music and the body is expressing what the music means and even though you can't tell what the music means you can tell that that dance is expressing.

Speaker 1:          05:38          And see I think what happens there is that music represents the patterns of being. It's actually because people think of music as a Non-representational art but I think that's wrong. I think it might be the most representational art is that being is made up of layers of patterned layers of patterns constantly interaction interacting and hopefully in a relatively harmonious way and music. Music demonstrates that mimics that in some sense abstractly and then the dance is an abstract representation like people adapt to the patterns of being and the dancer adapts to the pattern of music and so it's symbolic it's an embodied display of the place of the person in the cosmos. And you can you can also make that case when you see people dancing in pairs because you can dance alone or you can dance in pairs and that's basically standard human adaptation.

Speaker 1:          06:32          And music is interesting too because one of the things that you'll notice is that there's always music in a movie almost always there's the movie that doesn't have it's quite marked. When it's absent you know the movie feels a lot more cold and clinical although it can work. But we accept the idea that music can be used to fill in the missing context in a movie without even ever questioning it. Right. Like it's very strange if you think about it that you go to a movie that is doing at least at least part of its function is to portray reality in a realistic way. But there's a soundtrack playing in the background all the time and you don't know it. It's so useful and so appropriate that you don't notice how strange it is that that's OK.
