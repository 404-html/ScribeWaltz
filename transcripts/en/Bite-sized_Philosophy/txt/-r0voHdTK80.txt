Speaker 1:          00:00          My, my main question is actually something you said a couple of lectures ago. It was something along the lines of a family. I'm sorry. I'm like, God, that's the history of your family. Kind of like the sins of your family, something like that. Yeah. Do you, uh, you're facing it all the time? Yup. What's a. can you expand on that more?

Speaker 2:          00:26          Well, there's this idea in the old testament that your sins might be visited onto your family seven generations down. Seems kind of harsh, but you know, when you're confronting maybe your father's tyrannical. Yeah. But you know, maybe his father beat the hell out of him and maybe his father, his father was a vicious alcoholic and he just bloody well don't know how far back that goes. And, and that means also you don't exactly know what you're dealing with, right? To some degree you're dealing with your father, but only partly what you're dealing with is the pathological paternal spirit, something like that. And it's better to think about that way because it becomes an existential issue at that point. You know? So you could say that while the father has two components, and I, I mean this psychologically speaking, there's the great father that's beneficial in protective, that organize the society and teaches you how to speak and has produced all these wonderful things, and then there's the tyrannical oppressive part of the father, just like there's the terrible part of mother nature that's destructive and the benevolent part of Mother Nature that's wonderful and productive and you're stuck with that, right?

Speaker 2:          01:36          You're stuck with having to mediate between those opposing forces, just like you're stuck with the adversarial part of yourself in the heroic part of yourself and it's up to you to set those things. Right. Otherwise they propagate into the future and it isn't. It's a straightforward thing to say how to set them. Right. There's quite a good movie about that. Oh No, I won't be Magnolia, which I really love. It's by Paul Anderson, if I remember correctly. I hope that's right. It's a beautiful movie and it's about this. Part of it's about this kid whose father is really pushing them to be a superstar at a, at a quistio. Right? He's a genius kid. Hey, and uh,

Speaker 2:          02:19          the kids studies, this guy named Charles Sport, you don't understand this movie if you don't know this because you got to know about Charles fort to understand magnolia. Charles for was this weird old guy who got rich with an inheritance when he was 20 and spent the rest of his life in libraries looking up impossible things and documenting them. Impossible things that couldn't happen from a scientific perspective that we're well attested to by multiple observers and he produced this news paper called the 14 times, which still runs anyways in Magnolia. Magnolia begins with this guy who falls out of a building and then it's shot by a woman who misses her husband with a rifle as he falls and I think she's a. she's charged murder and the street names have something to do with the death sentence fault. And all of that happened, and then in the movie there's a rain of frogs and there are rains of frogs from time to time.

Speaker 2:          03:10          Sometimes they're frozen, sometimes their reins of fish. Sometimes they're frozen. It's like, what the hell? How does that happen? Happens quite frequently as it turns out there's a rain of frogs in the, in the, uh, movie magnolia and this little kid see what happened to him is that he's on stage and he ends up peeing his pants because of the pressure basically and humiliates himself and then there's this reign of frogs which she kind of takes us a sign from God and then he goes to his father even he's like eight years old, this kid and he says, you have to stop doing this to me. And He's dead serious about very careful not being, you know, what would you call insubordinate? Nothing like that. He decides that that's coming to an end right now. And you have to make those decisions in your family because otherwise things propagate down the generations. Right? And every family is rife with pathologies of one form or another. And you can learn from that and refused to push it forward. And that's part of, I think what you do when you, when you,

Speaker 3:          04:14          when you

Speaker 2:          04:15          shoulder your existential burden, because everyone is the beneficiary and the victim of the tyrannical father, just like everyone is the beneficiary. And the victim of mother nature and of themselves, and so you lock horns without and straightened it out one way or another and you don't move it forward to the next generation. So. And maybe you detach it a bit from your parents too because God only knows what combination of catastrophes culminated in their particular forms of pathology. So

Speaker 3:          04:51          good enough.
