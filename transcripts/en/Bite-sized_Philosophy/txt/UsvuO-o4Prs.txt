Speaker 1:          00:01          The postmodernists, they're the, they're the logical conclusion of the Nietzschean dilemma. God is dead value. The value structure collapsed. The specter of rises of all value structures collapsing. That's the postmodernist dogma. All value structures have collapsed. They're only there for the purposes of exclusion. They have no intrinsic value. It's a very, very powerful argument. That's why it dominates the universities. That and the fact that allows people to dispense with their moral responsibility, which is something that's never discussed by the postmodernist, but you have to give the devil his due. What's the problem with postmodernism? Well, if all value structures have collapsed, then there's nothing to do because in order to do something, one thing has to be better than another because otherwise why do it? And so people who are ensconced in the postmodern tradition are undermined by their own philosophy. They can deconstruct their own deconstruction, in which case they might as well just sit there and do nothing which would actually be preferable to what they're doing now.

Speaker 1:          01:18          So how do they extract themselves from that dilemma? They do any illogically, but they don't care because the postmodernists first of all, don't believe in logic. That's a reflection of the logos which they've dispensed with dialogue. They don't believe that because that's a reflection of the logos which they've dispensed with logic and dialogue are irrelevant. Well, that does bring up the problem of what to do. Well, the postmodernist finesse that by reverting to the Marxist doctrines from which postmodernism emerged and so they say, well, yeah, you can't get any direction from postmodernism, but we don't. We're not going to worry about that because we don't worry about such things. What we'll do is just use slight of hand to push forward the communitarian doctrines out of which our original hypothesis emerged and everyone says, well, we'll turn a blind eye to the paradox because we actually need something to do, and plus to the degree that we're communitarian, we can take out our nihilistic resentment and arrogance and in gratitude on every single person we deemed to have something more than we have.

Speaker 1:          02:27          And so if you're wondering why certain values can exist in the absence of any value, you have to look no farther than to understand that people who are desperate and chaotic will still be angry and destructive, and they can manifest that perfectly with the moral mask that says, well, I'm not really after what you have because you have a little more than me. I'm speaking on behalf of these people who have even less. It's like it's absolute nonsense. It's so funny watching Yale students complain about the privileged. They're in the top one 10th of 100 of a percent of people who've lived in the entire history of the planet, much less just the people that are on the planet. Now they're dominating patriarchs in training, right there, baby representatives of the patriarchy, and all they do is complain about that tiny, tiny, infinitesimal fraction of people who have slightly more than they have now. It's appalling. And their idiot professors pat them on the back and send them out the world to do that. Instead of teaching them how to live, they damaged their mental health. They, they, they heard our society. They're bringing things down and that's what they're aiming at.

Speaker 1:          03:47          The postmodernist managed to be nihilistic and totalitarian at the same time, which is something that not even need to dreamed about despite the fact that he had the greatest imagination for pathology that perhaps ever existed. In addition, they combine the nihilism and totalitarianism with the worst aspects of dogmatic religion because what they've essentially established is a cult into which children who attend university are now indoctrinated at great cost. I might add, and with very little practical outcome.
