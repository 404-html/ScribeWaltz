Speaker 1:          00:02          Well, here's the decomposition of the, of the fundamental archetype. The dragon of chaos differentiates on the one hand into the feminine. That's the unknown, and the feminine differentiates further into the negative feminine than the Positive Feminine. The negative feminine is the reason for which haunts. It's the reason for, um, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:24          there's a whole group online called men going their own way. M, g, T, O w, that's a very interesting group to go study. There's lots of them. I don't know how many of them there are, and most of them are older. Many of them are men who've been through a particularly horrifying divorce for one reason or another, and there they've had enough of women so they stay. Tell that young men that they're teaching never have a permanent relationship. Never share your territory with a woman, never share your possessions. Make sure you never lived together and don't stay with one long enough to enter a common law relationship because you will be stripped of everything that you have. Well, that's a hell of a thing to be telling people, but what's happened is that the female has been manifested in their life only as the negative archetype and they've got that confused with all women and that's partly, you know, you gotta ask yourself if you know the mythological stories, maybe if you made the right sacrifices, you wouldn't have so much trouble with women.

Speaker 1:          01:20          It's a, it's a good question to ask yourself first, and I would also say, you know, if you're a woman who has trouble with man or you're a man who has trouble with women, it's not the women and it's not the man, it's you because the women are telling you what's wrong with you and the men are telling you what's wrong with you and if you don't listen then it's you. It's either you are all men. Well that's easy. It's all men. While that's certainly how it's played out in the world right now, it's like, no, it's not all men. You can be by definition, by definition, and it's not all women. That's for sure. I don't want to have anything to do with women. It's like you're a pathetic weasel. That's the same statement.
