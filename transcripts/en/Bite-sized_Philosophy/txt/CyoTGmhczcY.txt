Speaker 1:          00:00          Another taboo is to celebrate European culture. Multiculturalists get pretty unhappy when Europeans start expressing pride in their culture or heritage. Many especially on the left, do not draw much of a distinction, at least in practice between European pride and white supremacy. You care about freedom of the individual, the individual's freedom to think, to speak, to associate in short, to act as he sees fit without external compulsion, as long as he doesn't infringe on the similar liberties of others. Professor Ricardo do a historical sociologists and professor at the University of New Brunswick argues that quote, individualism is a unique attribute of European peoples. Quote, it has been exported to some degree to other nations, but in my view, it is not something that comes to them naturally, so he continues. Quote, you can't play the game of we're all individuals. We have to affirm and be proud of our ethnic identity and heritage to preserve the West's curious individualism. If Europeans have become minorities in the west, he argues the founding idea of the West, that no entity, not an individual, not a community, not the state congested. We deprive an individual of life, liberty, or property by force, no matter what the individual's race, class or religion.

Speaker 1:          01:32          I wouldn't be surprised if Dushane when he made this statement, had you in mind.

Speaker 2:          01:36          Look, the

Speaker 1:          01:41          medieval Europeans identified seven deadly sins for reason and one of them was pride. It's like, let's make the presumption. I do believe that for for reasons that aren't obvious that the west has got some things right. We've got the sovereignty of the individual, right? That's the most fundamental thing we've got, right? We've articulated that I think in a, in a remarkable way, not only theologically, philosophically in her body of laws and our societies, and one of the consequences of that as it's had its effect on the rest of the world is that everyone is getting richer quite fast and that's a really good thing. Okay. Having said that, it's like, am I proud of that? It's like, I didn't do that. What the hell? Pride. What's that? That's not the right response. How about responsibility for that? How would that be? It's like you're a part of. This is great.

Speaker 2:          02:43          Okay,

Speaker 1:          02:44          and unlikely set of propositions, this strange set of propositions that says that in some ineffable manner, the poorest person is as valuable as the king. It's like, how the hell did we ever figure that out? That's an impossible thing to think and yet that's the. That's the bedrock of our legal system. That's nothing to be proud of. That's something to tremble before to take on as an ethical burden and not to wave a flag for how wonderful you are that you happen to have the same skin color as some of the people who thought that up. It's not the right response. It's like it's open your eyes and recognize that as a miracle and a relatively relatively new miracle on the world stage and to and to participate in the process of upholding that in your personal and your public life. That's not pride in European tradition.

Speaker 1:          03:39          Like when I go to Europe and I love going to Europe and the European cities are there unbelievable masterpieces, which is why they're completely flooded by pilgrims, right? Tourists, pilgrims who go there to look at the beauty, so I don't feel pride about that. I feel, I feel like I have something to live up to that's not the same thing, man, and so these right wingers in this, it's like, look what we've done. It's like, no, it's not you that did that. That's something mad you gotta you gotTa have your act together before you would dare to say, well, that was me. It's like, yeah, sure, sure it was you. Yeah, right. No, it's hard to stand up and take your place in that, in that kind of historical process, that unlikely, miraculous historical process, not to just feel ashamed at the way that you're presently constituted in the face of that means that you're diluted and you're using your, your your great fortune of being a beneficiary of that system. Look at what we've got here, this great pace that we're inhabiting right now. You're using your unearned, the unearned gift that's been granted to you as a source of personal pride in your accomplishments do to your skin. It's like, no, not good. Not a good argument. So and that doesn't mean that while there's nothing valuable about European culture, there's plenty. There's plenty about it that's value. It's not even so clear to what degree it's European. I mean it came out of the Middle East, you know, mean who it's so muddle headed that you hardly know where to start.
