Speaker 1:          00:00          Book called a billion wicked thoughts that was written by a bunch of engineers at Google and they were looking at billions of search, uh, billions of google searches and you know, there's no shortage of pornography on the Internet and it, and there's much less by proportion than there was when the Internet was first invented. And it's so interesting because it actually turned out that one of the things that drove the development of the Internet and the technology was the proclivity of young men to search out sexually provocative images. That was what was at the forefront of the development of the nets. Extraordinarily interesting. They were motivated to, they were motivated to use it for that purpose. And that provided the platform from which it emerged. Amazing. Anyways, the Google engineers looked at pornographic search processes and then segregated male searches from female searches. And what they found was that the mail search out images probably surprise no one, no one considers that, you know, particularly interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:00          But the female searched out literary representations of pornography. It was written. So I can give you an example of that. If you know about harlequin romances, does everybody still know about those? Anybody not know about those? Okay. Well there are mass market romances and have a very stereotypical type and they're. The original ones were pretty harmless in terms of no violence and no real sexual contact con content, but that was 40 years ago and they've differentiated tremendously and now there's hardcore harlequin romances and with, with particularly garish covers. And then there's the old, you know, more tame basic sexless and aggression list romances where everything is implied and not explicit, but the explicit ones exist.

Speaker 1:          01:49          So they did a plot analysis of the typical pornographic female fantasy. Well, and it was. So, it's so comical because engineers did this and social scientists would never do this because they'd be probably too concerned about the ethics of it or some damn thing. But engineers, you know, they'll just plow ahead with no concern whatsoever for such things and they actually discover things that way. And so they, they discovered the basic plot of the female pornographic literary product and they identified. So basically what happened was that a innocent well meaning and attractive young woman encounters a male who's a bit of a monster and the monster. There's five types of classic male monster for all your males who want to know this is what you can become a vampire. That's a good one. We're wolf, billionaire pirate and surgeon. Okay. So that's very interesting because.

Speaker 1:          02:47          Well first of all there's a dominance thing. There's a. Now you're actually blushing. You know, you're actually blushing about that. That's very, very funny. So sorry to point it out, but it's so comical, you know? I know, I know. It's so funny. I was reading this, I was reading this. It was just cracking me up. I thought, oh my God, really? Pirate Vampire, all of that explains it. What about all these damn vampire shows right there? So popular online. There are so popular on Netflix. Oh yes. And then there's the war wolf. There's nothing sexier than a werewolf apparently, but I mean, so there's predatory dope. There's predatory dominance that's implicit in that, right? With a billionaire, it's more abstract, but clearly that's an indication of very high success in the male dominance hierarchy, so, but there's this desire for aggression that's in that are real aggression, right, and it's not surprising to me, to me at all, it makes perfect sense, but what?

Speaker 1:          03:42          But the basic plot is that the woman encounters this mysterious and aggressive male and teams. That's the female hero myth as far as I can tell, it's beauty and the beast and so it's because, well, there's no fun in taming someone who's already tame and what makes you think you really want someone who's taken many ways. There's no interest in that. Plus when, when, when chaos manifests itself, what makes you think that someone tame is going to be good for anything and it's a real question and so that aggression is absolutely vital. It's absolutely necessary, but because it's in incredibly dangerous, which of course it is, it has to be civilized. And so what happens is that the archetypal female in these pornographic romances, seduces and tames, the aggressive male, and that's her encounter with chaos. Now it's more, it's more complicated. Of course, females, they're more complicated and that's exactly how it is and it's no wonder because there their lives are more complicated, but okay.
