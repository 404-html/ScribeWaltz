Speaker 1:          00:01          People even now, because it's the 100th anniversary of the Russian revolution, are celebrating Lennon. It's like, that's not good. That's like celebrating Hitler. Okay, I'm dead serious about that. It's not good, and the fact that people can dare to think that that's okay means that there's something wrong with the way that we look at history. Lennon was a monster and if you want to know about that, you can read Solzhenitsyn's writings about lending because they communist apologists say, well, it wasn't landing. Len was a good guy. He was all motivated by love of the working class. It's like, well, his henchmen was stolen and if you're Hansman is Stellan, you're not a good guy and lender who was around during the early collectivization and if you read what he wrote, you'll find out that he is perfectly willing to have any number of people die as long as his ideological system could be brought into big. So there's no celebrating Lennon. There's no work, cool young Marxist hip revolutionaries and he's our idol. It's like there's none of that. Not if you know anything, not if you're decent, whether it's death of the Kulaks I told you about that there was the Ukrainian famine. That's 6 million gone there. There was the rise of the Gulag state because it turned out that Russia, the Soviet Union couldn't run on the principles that it had that had, had a laid down as sacrosanct that just didn't work. So he had to enslave everybody and run your economy

Speaker 1:          01:35          as a slave state essentially.

Speaker 1:          01:40          And try not to kill the people in the gulags so fast that you can't suck some productive labor out of them is the death of tens of millions of people. We don't even know the estimates range from 15 to $60 million and like we won't get it to Picayune about the numbers because after the first 10 million you kinda made your point and the fact that we don't know between 15 and 60 is actually an indication. Yeah, of the horror of it because our count is off by tens of millions and that's only within the last century. And then there was the 1956 crackdown on Hungary and the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia. Then there was the whole like thermo nuclear Holocaust thing that was going on at the same time, and the fact that in 1962 and in 1984, we were seconds away from complete annihilation, right during the Cuban missile crisis, the keys were in the intercontinental ballistic missile release systems. And Castro, as he admitted to Jimmy Carter in case any of you are Castro fans, which you shouldn't be, that he was perfectly willing to have Cuba annihilated if it would've meant the defeat of the United States. And then in 1984 approximately, I may have the date exactly wrong, the Russians received an indication from their early warning systems that the Americans had launched five Thurman Nuclear Missiles and one Russian decided that it was a mistake and refused to launch the retaliation. And he just died about two weeks ago. So, you know, that was pretty close. And uh, so that was experiment number one. Let's say that that wasn't good, that experiment, let's put it that way. It wasn't good. It was exactly the antithesis of good. It was precisely the antithesis of good,

Speaker 1:          03:39          but that wasn't all. I mean, there's the People's Republic of China. That's a different country, like seriously, a different country, right? Different tradition, different language.

Speaker 1:          03:51          How many people died in China under Mao? No one knows. Same issue with the Soviet Union. Although mile was a bigger monster than Stalin and that's. That's impressive. You know, because there's Hitler, there's Stalin and Mao and of the three mile was probably the worst. He's still revered in China. Maybe that accounts for their affinity for North Korea, which could still destroy us. All the remnants of that horrible state. Maybe a 100 million people died in China during the great leap forward. That's a hell of a leap forward. Well, maybe it wasn't a 100 million, you know, maybe it was only $40 million, but as I said before, when you're counting in the tens of millions of your points already made, and then there was Cambodia and the killing fields and Bulgaria and east Germany and Romania and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. That's North Korea and Vietnam and Ethiopia. Hungary, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. There was never a successful communist state. Cuba, I suppose, came closest, but it was radically,

Speaker 2:          05:01          um,

Speaker 1:          05:04          the Soviets poured money into Cuba. So that doesn't really count. So then the first question was, well, are these Marxists motivated by love or hatred?

Speaker 2:          05:18          Well,

Speaker 1:          05:21          is it love or hatred that produces $100, million dead people? Is that enough evidence or not? And if it's not enough evidence, if you think to yourself, well, that's not enough evidence, it was never really given its proper,

Speaker 2:          05:38          a proper try.

Speaker 1:          05:40          It's like, well, why would have been a proper try to. I always think when I hear someone say that I know what you think, you think in your delusional arrogance, that you understand the Marxist doctrines better than anyone else ever has, and that if you were one implementing those doctrines, you would have ushered in the utopia. That's what you mean when you say that and no, they're there. They saying there's an idea in the new testament that there is a sin. It's a sin against the holy ghost. If you commit that sand, no one really knows what it is that you can't be forgiven, and I would say, well, if you want a candidate for the sin against the Holy Ghost and the 21st century, the statement communism, real communism was never tried with the underlying idea that if you had been the person implementing it would have worked. I think that's pretty good contender for something for which you should never be forgiven.
