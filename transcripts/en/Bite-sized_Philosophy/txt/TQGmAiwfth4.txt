Speaker 1:          00:01          There's an old story about how to catch a monkey in case any of you are interested in how to catch a monkey. Now you now you're going to know how to do it. First you have to take a large, narrow neck jar just large enough in diameter at the top for a monkey to put a tanned inside. Then you have to fill it partway with rocks so it's too heavy for the monkey to carry. Then you scatter some treats near the jar to attract them and you put some inside inside the narrow neck. Gr a monkey will come along if you're lucky and grabbed the goodies, but he'll want the ones inside the jar too, so then put his hand in there and grab what's in there. And if you've set up your monkey truck properly, then he won't be able to get his hand out because he's got the goodies.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Not Without unclenching his hand, not without relinquishing what he already has. The monkey coucher can just walk over and just pick up the monkey because the monkey isn't into the whole sacrifice thing because he's just a monkey. You know? And so you can catch him as a consequence of his own, an regulated hypothalamic desires to be. What would you say, charitable to the Monkey, if you put out candy or something like that. So like how often does a monkey get candy? He's probably a little more motivated than you are to not let go, but you can get the point. The monkey catcher can just walk over to the jar and pick up the monkey. The animal will not sacrifice the part for the whole. That's actually a pretty good phrase. Hey, it's the animal that will not sacrifice the part for the whole. Perhaps this story is apocryphal, but as an eccentric psychology professor once told me, fiction lies to you in the most truth, in the most truthful possible manner, something valuable given up ensures future prosperity, something valuable, sacrificed, pleases the Lord.

Speaker 1:          01:59          Those are equivalent statements. One's more articulated. I would say. That's the first statement. And the second one is more dramatic and more embedded in a collective religious dream. You might say, what's most valuable and best sacrificed? Well, obviously that depends on the culture and the time. What is it least emblematic of that? A choice cut of meat? Well, if you're a herdsmen, for example, that that's a big deal. I mean, generally speaking, throughout human history, meat has been a very valuable commodity as it is, by the way, among chimpanzees. Chimpanzees hunt, they like to hunt, call us monkeys, and you know, they'll, they'll basically start eating the damn monkey lie. They weigh about 40 pounds despite the fact that the thing is screaming away, and that's pretty interesting because one of the things that indicates is that male monkeys mailchimp's, they're the ones that do the hunting, aren't really inhibited that much when they're in fear mode by what you might describe as empathy and there's certain elements of human behavior are reminiscent of that. You see that sort of thing have merged now and then in human battlefields when groups of men seem to abandoned all internal regulation whatsoever, to a degree that makes you wonder if internal regulation even exists.
