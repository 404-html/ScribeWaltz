Speaker 1:          00:00          Part of spiritual development is to recognize the satanic tendencies that characterize you and to fully wrestle with them and to and to integrate them. That's the thing. It's not so much to cast them away, it's to transmute them, you know, and you can see the difference between people who've done that and people who haven't, at least to some degree because people who haven't integrated the shadow at all are naive and you can tell that when you look at them and you can tell that when you talk to them and because they're naive, they're often resentful as well because they get taken advantage of it and someone who's integrated that more, they're dangerous in the martial arts sort of way, which is they're dangerous, but they don't have to be. They don't have to use it because their presence radiates.

Speaker 1:          00:55          What would you say it? It doesn't radiate threat. Exactly. Well certainly strength, but it's. It's, it's, it's the potential for havoc. That's the right way of thinking about it. There's a, there's an implicit potential for havoc and that's really necessary. It, it. One of the things that gives people self respect, this is an interesting thing about the integration of the shadow because recognizing yourself as the locus of evil, let's say actually in some sense gives you far more respect for yourself strangely enough because the same respect that you might have for a wild animal or even a monster. It's like in those so then maybe you learn to treat yourself differently like I think this is particularly true with regards to the discipline of children. You know, if you know that you're a monster and that that will manifest itself in your life consciously or unconsciously and unconsciously, it's, it's, it's not good, then you become better at disciplining children and the reason for that is that you don't want to expose them to your dark side.

Speaker 1:          02:03          And so if they behave and don't provoke you, which means they'll also behave for other people, then you don't. The monstrous part can stay in abeyance and then that's great, but if you don't understand yourself as capable of wreaking havoc, and that can be the kind of havoc that unfolds over decades, right? Because if you're going to abuse a child, it's the primitive form of abuse, the physical abuse, the sophisticated form of abuse is the continual undermining of the child's courage across perhaps their entire life and that there's a terribly monstrous element to that, and if you're not respected properly by the child, say you will absolutely take revenge on them and you know that's a whole in some sense, that's the whole Freudian psychoanalytic story. It's just not all of it, but it's a huge part of it. So interesting that you say that you have to the fact that you're dangerous

Speaker 2:          03:00          or become dangerous. Because I'd also say that if you haven't done that kind of shadow work, if you haven't made friends with your anger, if you haven't integrated it, you're actually more dangerous because then things will happen that will. It will come out in a way that you don't to.

Speaker 1:          03:14          Right. It comes out disintegrated. So it comes out as an autonomous spirit, right? Under no one's control and that's like a burst of rage. Let's say. You know, when you, when you hear about a mother who's done something terrible to one of her children, it's, that's the reason is that, you know, she, maybe she's just been laid off. Maybe she went out and had too much to drink. Maybe she's hung over, you know, she's, she's angry and lonesome and she's overwhelmed by the responsibility of the children and she has a child who's testing and she doesn't know how to limit it. And one day the child tests at exactly the wrong time and it's like mayhem and everybody goes, well, what happened? It's like, well, seven terrible things came together at the same time and produced this outburst of disintegrated rage and like, look the hell out when that happens. You know? So yeah, you want to have that. You either you either have that or it has you. Those are the options and you don't become safe by being castrated.
