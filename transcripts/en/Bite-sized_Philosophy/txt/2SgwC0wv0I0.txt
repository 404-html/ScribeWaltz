Speaker 1:          00:00          Well, again, I see that it's a consequence of continual adjective, agitation by I would say a minority of the left, the radical left in particular, and those are people who aren't Marxist Slash Neo Marxist in their fundamental ideological orientation and have joined that in an unholy union with the worst of French postmodernism and and they, they push it forward ideological certainty and the thing that, the thing that's really distressing about that is that if you know anything about the history of oppressed people, let's say, much as I hate to engage in that particular form of dialogue under the current conditions, it's pretty obvious that it's freedom of speech is freedom. That's particularly important for people who don't have anything else, right? It's, if you're supporting freedom of speech, you're not supporting the status quo. I mean, just think about, let's, let's use the logic of the radical leftists and assume that society is a tyrannical hierarchy and the people at the top have the upper hand in everything, including access to communication. These people are not your friends.

Speaker 2:          01:21          No, that's mark my words. Now it's the sounds of the barbarians pounding at the gates. Right? That's awesome. I'll tell you again to use it in Kuwait,

Speaker 1:          01:49          what would you call it in Kuwait? Sensation is the best formulation of their argument. And there's not much difference between knocking on the doors and knocking on you. So keep that in mind. It's not a music, there's nothing to it. There's nothing for it. I think that's also quite appalling is that there is no evidence whatsoever that the people who are conducting these protests know what it is that they're protesting against in a way was in.

Speaker 2:          02:22          Alright, alright.

Speaker 1:          02:23          I was in the midst of a discussion and attempting to make the case that it's freedom of speech. That's. That is what people who have nothing still have. Right? So if you look at the tyrannical structure of our society, let's say the people at the top have access to means of communication. Everyone knows that it's the people at the bottom who have the right to say what they think, however badly they say it. It enables them to get a toe hold into the system and to and to make their suffering known. That's what freedom of speech is for and so like what's the protest against that, and I'll tell you, you know that the rowdy called Neo Marxist types. They speak the language of power and that's what they're speaking right now, and if you want to live in a world where everyone speaks the language of power, then just let them do what they're doing and see what happens. I wouldn't recommend it. It's not a pretty rote and you're all in a position. You're on a situation in your life now where you have to make decisions about this sorts of things. Like is this the sort of institution that you want this to be.
