Speaker 1:          00:00          And so they're off to pleasure island dark place and uh, the coachman opens the gates and lets the delinquents into pleasure island and they basically have a riot. And this is pleasure island here. It's full of amusement park rides. And you know, one of the things that's kind of interesting about horror movies, I'm sure you've noticed this, is that they're often sat at amusement parks and clowns are often characters of horror. We'll leave the clowns aside for now. But the amusement park thing that's pretty interesting. It's like why in the world with an amusement park, he, a place of horror. And the first question might be, well, have you ever been to an amusement park? Because there is something about them that's really. They have a dark side, clear, dark side. And part of it is that people with nothing better to do or spending money stupidly.

Speaker 1:          01:00          And they're being fleeced by the people who operate the the amusement park, you know, and they have, let's say, a stereotypically dark reputation and they're moving around all the time, which is also something that psychopaths do and all they're doing is moving from community to community and taking the money from the rubes fundamentally. And so the amusement park, well if you walk through an amusement park without sort of thing in mind, maybe that's also coloring your vision of course, but it's something that you could see very immediately. So there's something about them that's sort of deeply sad, but there's also that under, there's an underlying horror that characterizes them that it's easy for horror movie or horror novel writers to immediately expand upon. And there's something about it that, that makes sense to people. So it's too easy. Maybe that's. And it's also all short term gratification. That's the other thing. So you spend your money very rapidly and it's gone. Yep.

Speaker 1:          02:07          Yes, exactly. Well, that's the impulsive element that the comment was, it's a celebration of, of meanings divorced from reality. Yeah. That's. Well, it's also outside of reality, right? That's why it's on an island, it's a separate universe and it's a universe where nothing that's happening is connected to anything outside and you're spending your hard earned money, let's say, but it isn't that much. It's certainly not an investment. It's not that much different than burning it what is because of course you get some pleasure out of it, but. But it isn't going with their everyday is probably not the wisest move that you could make. So the animators do a good job of, of while I'm presenting the, what would you call it, the in hedonism, I guess I would say of a place like that. This is a place where you're going to have fun. That's what it's for.
