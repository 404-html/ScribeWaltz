Speaker 1:          00:01          So I've noticed when I've lived in places rented or owned, didn't matter then if there were part of the place, if there was a part of the place that I hadn't attended to, whatever that might mean, it might meant cleaned. It might've meant fixed, but it certainly meant at least thoroughly investigated. Then that was chaos. It was like it was. It was like the desert. That part that's, that's a way of thinking about it. It wasn't mine. Even if I owned it wasn't mine. I had to interact with it before it became mine and I had to interact with it and I had to put it in order and then it became mine and then. And then to the degree that it became mine and was in order, then I was also put an order. Now you know that because you go into places that make you uncomfortable and maybe it's your own house, it's highly probable.

Speaker 1:          00:46          It's highly probable. I, you know, I walked into. Well Chinese doctors do this. Traditional Chinese doctors, they go into place people's place and they diagnosed their health conditions on the, on the balance of Yin and Yang chaos and order. They walk into a house that this is easy to do. You walk into a house, there's too much chaos. Hey, you can detect that in no time flat. Everything is out of order and chaotic. You don't even want to be there. You certainly don't want to open the refrigerator. That's for sure, and there are things that should've been done years ago, everywhere and every one of those things is a fight that hasn't happened and something that's been avoided and you can't even walk in there and maintain your health. As soon as you walk in there, you're sicker than you were when you were outside and that's one sort of place.

Speaker 1:          01:28          And then another sort of places you go in and you look at the living room and the person has vacuum. The living room rug and the lines that were vacuumed are parallel to one another and the and the furniture is covered with plastic and you get a glass of water and then just as you're going to set it down on the coffee table, the person rushes over and puts a coaster underneath it and everything in that house says to you that it would be a lot more perfect in that house if you were either not there or dead and that's and that's the message that the whole house is blasting at you. And if you happen to live there, then you're going to be sick and what you're going to be sick from is too much order and in the other house you're going to be sick from too much chaos. And so when you interact with a house, the unexplored parts are the chaos that that parts that you have not yet contended with are the chaos that has not yet been transformed by your embodied logos. Action into habitable territory. And it does not belong to you.
