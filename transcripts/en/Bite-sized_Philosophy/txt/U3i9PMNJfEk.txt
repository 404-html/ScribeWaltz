Speaker 1:          00:00          My, my nephew had a dream at one point, this little, someone made a little animated thing out of it and put it on the intranet, which is quite cool. So anyways, he, he, he was having night terrors and he ran around like a little night, uh, you know, Kai, a Connecticut, k n I g h t night, and he had little, you know, armor and a sword and he run around the house with little hat on being the night and he was only like four or something. And he'd watched this lot of Disney movies, lot of movies. So he kinda got the night idea was it was at his acting that out and he was having these terrors at night, right. So He'd go to bed with his little hat and his sword and he put them on is bad. And then at night he'd wake up screaming.

Speaker 1:          00:44          And that happened for a very long time. And so when I went to visit, uh, you know, I found out that this was happening and he had a night terror. So the kid wakes up with night terrors screaming but can't remember anything. Generally speaking. So anyways, this was happening and so it happened one day and I was sitting with him and his family at the, at the breakfast table, and I said, uh, did you, did he have a dream? And he said, Oh yes, I had a dream. I said, well, you know, what was your dream? And He, and he said, well, I was out on this field and, and, and I was surrounded by these dwarfs. And they came up to my knees and they were, they didn't have any arms, they had big feet and they were covered with hair and there was a cross shaved at the top of their head and they were all greasy and they had huge beaks.

Speaker 1:          01:28          And everywhere I went they jumped at me with their beaks and there was lots of them and everybody was very quiet after he said this because it was like that, oh, that's why you're screaming at night. It's like, yeah, okay. And so, so, and, and, and then he said, but, but at the background there was a dragon and the dragon would blow out smoke and fire and then it would turn into these. Dwarfs, so it's like, man, that kid had a problem, right? It was like, well, what are you going to do? We fight off a dwarf. Who Cares? It's like plus 10 more. That's life, man. That's life. Really. That's the Hydra. You cut off one head, seven more grow. That's life snakes everywhere and you get rid of one, there'll be more. And so he figured that out. It's a hell of an existential shock when you're four.

Speaker 1:          02:16          And so he's like, he's a knight. He's thinking, what do I do about these dwarfs while there's too many of them, but there's a dragon also. I said, well, what could you do about that? Right. Loaded question. It implies that you could do something about that. Well, he kind of knew that, which is why he was running around like a night, you know, he kind of figured that out and he said, well, I get my dad and I jump up on the dragon and I poke out both of its size with my sword, and then I go right down. It's stomach to the place where the fire came out, the firebox and then I carve a piece of the firebox Oh, did I make a shield? And that would be the end of that. And I thought, wow, good work kid. Like you really got it right.

Speaker 1:          02:58          It's the, it's the central human story. There's the terrible unknown, right? Fire-Breathing generating trouble. And what do you do? You confront that, you confront that and by confronting it you get stronger. That's the shield and that's, that's what a human being is. And that's, that's right. It's exactly right. And that was the end of his night terrors by the way, which seems too good to be true, but it is actually true because I followed up with his mother for a long time and that was that he catalyze that part of his identity. He adopted the role of the mythological hero and that's what he needed to do because like there was lots of drag. There's a dragon and a bunch of gifts, like, what the hell are you going to do about that run? That's not gonna help. You know, if you run in a dream like that, the doors multiply and they get bigger and you get smaller as you run. It's like that's not a good. That is not a good solution. And people do that in their life all the time and so the dwarves get bigger until they're giants and they get smaller until there's nothing left of them and then then there's no recovery. That is not good.
