Speaker 1:          00:00          And the midianites sold Joseph into Egypt, unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaohs and captain of the guard. And Joseph was brought down to Egypt and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, and the Egyptian bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites, which had brought him down thither. So now he's a slave. So now you'd think, well that would be, this is a man who has a lot of reason to be irritated at the structure of reality. Right? He's gone from being the favorite to being betrayed by all of his brothers. That's pretty rough. And then he's being transformed into a slave and now he's being. He's being sold to work as a slave. So you'd think that that would corrupt his character because you know, one of the things, I think this is the case anyways, I think people are always looking for an excuse to have their character corrupted.

Speaker 1:          00:48          Because if your character is corrupted, then you get to lie and you get to cheat and you get to steal and you get to be trade. You get to act resentfully and you get to do nothing. And that's all easy. It's easier to lie than to tell the truth. It's easier to do nothing than to do something. So there's always part of you thinking, well, I need a justification for being useless and horrible because that, that'd be a lot less work. And so then if something terrible comes along, you think a, that's just exactly the excuse that I was waiting for. And then out all that comes, you know, soldiers should Ipsen when he was in the concentration camps in Russia watching how people behaved, you know, he said that there were people that were put into camps who immediately became trustees are guards and they were even more vicious than the people who had been hired as guards.

Speaker 1:          01:36          And his idea was that they had collected all that. He called it fallenness, if I remember correctly around them in normal life. But they didn't have the opportunity to express it. But as soon as you gave them the opportunity, it was like there, it was right away. And so, so one of the messages that seems to echo through these old testament stories is that just because something terrible happens to you doesn't mean that you get to be, that you get to wander off the path and make things worse. And maybe it doesn't matter how terrible it is that what happens to you, that's a tough call, you know, because you see people now and then in life who they've really got it rough man, like 50 bad things are happening to them at the same time. And you think, oh, it's no wonder if you are bitter and resentful and hostile.

Speaker 1:          02:27          It'd be like, yeah, no wonder. But then you meet people and social hits and again talked about this in the Gulag archipelago. He said he met lots of people in a not lot. He met enough people to impress him in the concentration camp system who didn't allow their misfortunes to corrupt them. And that's something man, because maybe the only real misfortune is to become corrupted. That's a really useful thing to think, you know, maybe the rest of it, maybe the rest of it is trivial in comparison. I know that's a rough thing because you can be in very harsh circumstances, but I do think there's something to that and the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master. The Egyptian and his master saw that the Lord was with him and the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

Speaker 1:          03:11          So that's an echo of the idea that we encountered earlier about walking with God. Right. So Adam walked with God before he ate the fruit with eve and then he wouldn't walk with God and they had noah walked with God and Abraham walked with God. And so the idea is, well, that's that alignment with the highest ideal. I think it's something like that and you know, we can think about that as a metaphysical claim as well, but I don't think it is. I mean, I've got thousands of letters now in the last year from people who have told me that they were in a pit. That's exactly right, and that they decided that they were going to try to put their lives together and that it worked and so that's really something, you know, when they write surprised, it's like, well, I decided that I was going to work hard at what I was doing and I wasn't going to lie any more than absolutely necessary.

Speaker 1:          04:04          I thought I'd give it a try for a few months, you know, and all sorts of good things started to happen. To me it's like maybe that's how the world works now. Obviously it doesn't work like that all the time. Right. Because you can get sliced off at the knees. I mean there's an arbitrary element to existence that's that you can't wish away, but that doesn't mean that there are. It doesn't mean that there aren't bad strategies and good strategies. So I do think that one of the most fundamental existential questions is like, if things are going well for you in your life, is are you absolutely certain that you're doing absolutely everything you can to put things in order? Because if you're not, then you shouldn't complain because you don't know to what degree you're actually contributing or even causing the circumstance. Now, that's a very annoying thing to think, and I'm not trying to blame the victim. You know, I know that people end up with lung cancer because they were exposed to asbestos. You know, I'm not trying to. Although I also know too that if you have lung cancer because you've been exposed to asbestos, that can be a tragedy or can be hell. And to some degree, that depends on how you conduct yourself.
