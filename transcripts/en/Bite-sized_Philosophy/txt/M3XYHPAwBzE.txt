Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah, so there's this interesting phenomenon that it's very characteristic of, of, of societies, I believe pretty much everywhere it's being studied. Now you can calculate an index called the Gini Coefficient. The Gini Coefficient is a number that represents how much inequality of income distribution there isn't a given geographical area. So you could calculate a Gini Coefficient for a street or a, you know, an area in a city or a city or a state or a country. You can do it at all those levels. And uh, what you find is, you know, you always hear this idea that poverty causes crime. That's a classic leftwing idea, but it's wrong, it's seriously wrong and it's importantly wrong. And it's definitively wrong. Not only that, so there's no argument about this. It's already been established. What causes crime, especially aggressive crime is relative poverty and relative poverty is not the same thing as poverty at all.

Speaker 1:          01:01          It's seriously not the same thing. Poverty is when you don't have enough to eat. Relative poverty is when the guy next door has a much better car than you. So, and there's lots of relative poverty in the United States. And there's some absolute poverty, but even the absolute poverty in the United States is nothing like the absolute poverty say in places like India or in Subsaharan Africa where absolute poverty means you have nothing. Now what's really interesting about the Gini Coefficient is that if you go to places where everyone, roughly speaking is poor, say by national standards. I think South Dakota was often used as an example or maybe one of the maritime provinces like Newfoundland, where there's where there's low average income, but it's pretty flat distribution. There's almost no crime. And if you go to the places where the everyone's rich, then there's almost no crime. But if you go places where there were poor people and moderately well off people and rich people and the distribution is really steep, then the rate of aggressive behavior among young men and it's usually within their own ethnic group, starts to spot skyrocket out of the control.

Speaker 1:          02:13          And the reason for that seems to be that if the dominance hierarchy is too steep than the young men have no likelihood of climbing to a dominant position well playing the standard social game. And so what they do is turn to aggression, aggression to, to make their mark on the world. And it works too. That's the other thing is that make no mistake about it. If you're, if you're looking for status in a place where status is hard to achieve and you're the meanest, toughest guy around then and you know, around a bunch of people who like, you don't have much money, then you're going to benefit from that status if it works. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:53          Because they know that I, that is higher than it is in Canada reason. Sure, sure. Yeah. I mean you can make a real conservative argument for making sure that the conservatives are very anti income distribution and we figured that's because of the guys that have this male independence, you know, they identify with this male independence factor. They don't want to be distributing resources to people who are down in the dominance hierarchy because they will. They want them down in the dominance hierarchy. They want there to be a difference between the people on top and the people on the bottom so that they can be the people on top. So that it increases the relative attractiveness, like it's a perfectly logical game and they presume that while the rules are set up and like every man can go for it, do as fast in the winter winds and the loser loses and that's just how it is.

Speaker 1:          03:40          And don't ask me to fix it because I don't want to, you know. And besides that it's, I don't find it, I find it distasteful to attempt to fix it more than that. Right? Because it's a moral issue. It's not an intellectual issue. So. So you, you can make a case however you can make a case from the conservative point of view, especially with regards to say beliefs and religious traditionalism and the desire to maintain social stability that you shouldn't let income distribution become two unequal. Like one of the big things your society has to do is to make sure that that doesn't get out of hand because it tends to get out of hand. It tends towards a few people having everything and almost everyone else having nothing. It's a natural in a sense. It's a natural consequence of economic progression, which is actually something that marks pointed out, although an Italian name, peritoneal had figured it out at approximately the same time and I think with a lot more conceptual clarity, but the more unequal you let your society get, the higher the probability of death roughly speaking through through violent causes and you know, um, but, but, but I'm telling you why it is that, you know, men want to climb the dominance hierarchy and the reason they want to call them the dominance hierarchies because that's how they get access to women

Speaker 2:          05:00          fucking familiar, familiar in the structure. So it seems like we all want to live within the structure yourself.

Speaker 1:          05:13          Well, we have this contradictory problem. We want to be protected by the structure, but we want to advance our position within it. And so that means what that should mean. And this is, I think the definition of civilized behavior is that you're allowed to advance your position within the structure as long as you don't disrupt it negatively. You know, and I think most people do do that. In fact, I think people in civilized countries do that so effectively that it's an absolute incomprehensible miracle. I can't understand how or why it ever got established, but like a psychopath will. He climbed the ladder and cut the rungs off underneath them fundamentally, right? It's like he doesn't care. He doesn't even care if the damn thing maintains itself. You know, he's perfectly willing to have it destroyed after he's exhausted it, you know, but if everyone acted like that, or even if a fairly substantial percentage of people acted like that, the whole thing would come to a halt, virtually like in no time flat. So, so mean.

Speaker 1:          06:16          Why? See? You might hear. Here's the reason. Likely, you know, because one of the things we were talking about was masculine violence. Now the thing about masculine violence is it only tends to emerge in situations where there doesn't. There don't seem to be any other reasonably viable means of advancing status. So it's not reasonable to say that men are aggressive. You can say that on average, men are more aggressive than women. And you can also say that if that if you put men in a situation where they have no, where they can see status differences, but they have no means of moving forward, that they're likely to turn to aggression as a way of establishing dominance. And then you can say that that's the reason for that is because it makes them more attractive. What are the fundamental reasons

Speaker 2:          07:10          I read this article was about how societies are. Yeah, absolutely. When one guy has two wives, I mean 50 percent of the population have access to sex.

Speaker 1:          07:24          Yeah, that's exactly right. That the, the, the, the evolutionary psychology explanation for the pathology of polygamy is that if, once you let it establish itself, then the men get ultra violent.

Speaker 2:          07:34          So. So would you say that

Speaker 1:          07:39          many people have said that and. Yes, I think you can make a strong case for that. And I think the fundamental reason is the one that you just pointed out, you know, the idea is, well, would you rather have one woman or die now or sorry, that's not quite right. Would you rather know next? Not Quite. That's not quite right. Would you, it's more like, would you be willing to limit yourself to one partner or have a shot at many partners but a much higher probability of dying? Right. And you know, some guys will take that, they'll take the high risk approach, you know, so now if this doesn't delineate the difference in individual differences in determining who's going to be aggressive, because what'll happen is that as the Gini Coefficient pressure rises, the more aggressive men, the men who were more aggressive by nature will get more aggressive first.

Speaker 1:          08:33          Right? So you could imagine there it's a threshold phenomena in some sense. So add, I, I should tell you as well as the relationship between the Gini Coefficient and male on male homicide isn't like point two or point three, which is about the correlation that you'd get if you were predicting something like that. Using personality. It's like point eight or point nine. It's like it eats up all of it. It's explanation. So it's a huge effect. You know, it's so, it's so big in affected. You could basically say, oh well we figured that out. Although psychologists never know when they figured anything out in, they keep endlessly retesting it over and over and over because you know, we don't know how to bring our science to a stock, but if you don't accept the Gini Coefficient aggression down, it's like you might as well throw the rest of the social sciences out the window because the effect is unbelievably powerful.

Speaker 3:          09:23          Let you go.

Speaker 1:          09:25          It depends. You can do it at any level of analysis. You can do it, you can do it by county, you can do it by city, you can do it by state and you can do it by country and it works on all of those levels.

Speaker 3:          09:37          Predicted aggression. You

Speaker 1:          09:39          Bet. Yeah. Yeah, and that's a great question. I mean the methodologically sophisticated studies have done exactly that to ensure that while to ensure that it's actually this phenomena rather than other factors that might be operative in that particular geographical area. So countries with a higher GDP, Gini Coefficient or more violent and cities within that country that have a higher than average Gini Coefficient for that country are more violent. On average. What's a very, very robust, robust, robust finding. So. Alright, so we're good. We're going to say for the sake of argument that you've got the male dominance hierarchy and it's represented as masculine. No. One of the things young said, he thought that women carried an image of Matt Nan in their unconscious and she, he thought that the image that women carried of men in their unconscious with a group of men, not an individual matt, he called that the animus. Whereas he believed that the image that women image of women that men carried in their collective unconscious was of a single woman and he called that the anima.
