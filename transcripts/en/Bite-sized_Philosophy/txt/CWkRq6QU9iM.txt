Speaker 1:          00:00          Any more pages and stuff coming up. Oh yeah. Yeah, of course. Think with psm. I mean, I was saying this to him, to his wife. It's like when you're making music and writing and stuff, oftentimes you quote the greats and you know, you quote a hunter s Thompson or you're a young or whatever, but they're all dead, you know, and they didn't. They were already. Or if there are audio recordings of them, they're not very good and there aren't that many of them. And here we have peterson like spitting fucking napalm on a daily basis, like dropping, laying in hours of audio everyday. It's all fucking brilliant. It's all incredibly valuable. And it's also incredibly sonorous musical and beautiful and important and necessary right now. If I did nothing else in my life, even if I didn't even eat, I could just sit there making peterson music forever because there's so much material.

Speaker 1:          00:48          So, um, I will continue to make Peterson stuff and it will continue to be useful when there's also many, many other things to draw into music and make useful in that fashion. It's basically, it appears to be a new genre or at least a new way of sort of communicating ideas and stuff and I've always done it. I've always made mixed tapes that bought in people talking and bringing in ideas and meeting musical. Just like now there's a real big appetite for it and thanks to those lovely robots over at Youtube. It's just an expanding universe of, of a potential for people actually wanting to listen to it and being able to do it. Isn't there will be a jd and low fi genre? Well, there is no other people are doing it now. If you go, if you go look it up, there's actually loads of people doing it now to like varying degrees of success. But lots of people are doing it and I've been doing it with other things and it's, it's called meaning wave now. Um, someone called it that in a car. There was a genre. It's now, yeah, it's a thing. It's called meeting wave. Uh, it combines music, aesthetics of low fire and vapor wave and vapor trap and, and cloud rap and with meaningful spoken stuff. So it's not just peterson? No, it's now just, it's Kinda like the intellectual dark web thing I guess. But with music,

Speaker 2:          02:10          yeah, struggle for power size each other up and elect the competent and they do that at every level of society. Side rail crew in southern Saskatchewan. Rough guys, like a lot of them have been in prison. You know when you first came onto the rail crew, you got a stupid nickname and people tease, and I remember this one kid called lunchbox because he came to the rail crew with a lunch bucket that looked like his moment packed in. That was a bad idea. So they him lunch buckets, but she wasn't very happy about. That was a mistake. He should have taken it with a smile and then he was always to bowman if you asked him to do something even wide,

Speaker 3:          03:10          why

Speaker 2:          03:14          it's about 60 men on this stretched on the trucks. Soon. Anonymous philosophers were throwing pebbles out during her. So on and so the gateway, let's see if we can get that lunch bucket. And that was purposeful because he didn't, he couldn't take a job. It's like, well, let's see if he could take this job, and then it just got more and more peevish and the pebbles got bigger and bigger. Learned anything from experience, but you come. It's like you take a job, can you be useful? Can you at least be amusing? Is there something worthwhile? No. It's like, okay, well then you're rounding because you never know when we actually might need to depend on you.
