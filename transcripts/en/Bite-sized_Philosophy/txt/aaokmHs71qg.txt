Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:01          oh, it's an appalling ideology because the people who created it had the idea about what it should be before they made it. So it's propaganda. You can say exactly what frozen is about. So it's propaganda. A truly mythologically based story. You can never fully say what it's about. You can just talk about it forever and ever and ever and ever. So it's, it's a wellspring of meaning,

Speaker 1:          00:24          so.

Speaker 2:          00:30          Oh sure they are. Of course that's what they're doing. Oh yeah, it's calculated marketing. Yeah. Yeah, sure. It was hyper politically correct. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And they didn't need men and you know, God, give me a break, you know, just because you need men doesn't mean you have to like them. Yeah. So, so I mean I thought a lot about the difference between propaganda and art. So art actually a process rather than an end product and with any luck if you have a piece of art, the process is embedded in the byproduct and so it reflects the process when you bring it into your house. And so it's an active, it's a, it's a crystallized active exploration and the real artist doesn't know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing. They're exploring. I can, I can recommend a film. There's a film made of Picasso wouldn't boat 1957 and it was a black and white film and it was actually a film of him making a painting and he painted it on glass so you could see what he was doing.

Speaker 2:          01:29          It's really quite fascinating because you can see that he's playing, he sketches it in and then he rubs it out so then he sketches it in again and he rubs it out and he sketches over here and it's like there's a real dynamism about it. He doesn't plan it out to begin with. Not that there's necessarily anything wrong with that as an artistic endeavor to. But PAGASA was trying to explore and understand and you know, I don't know what you knew about cubism, but cubism. It's a strange thing. But what he was doing with his cubism was to try to show you that you only see things from one perspective, but the things exist in multiple perspective, so you know, a cubist painting is your face this way and your face this way at the same time. And so you could say, well, is that a more accurate way of of representing a person that just the standard portrait and Picasso would say, well in some ways definitely because it captures the transformative element rather than the static element.

Speaker 2:          02:24          And so someone who's a true artist doesn't have a political message. And it's funny because my house is full of ideological propaganda from the Soviet Union. It's just packed full of it and it's so interesting to watch these artifacts because a lot of them were socialist realist, although mostly they're impressionist. Really. It's so interesting to watch them because in that painting themselves, there is a war that you can perceive and the war is a lot of the people who made these paintings were incredibly talented, really, really skilled because the Russians kept their. Their Formula Academy's open so the can really paint impressionism. It's remarkable, but their talents were encapsulated within this what mostly this ideology and so in each canvas there's this war between the ideological message and the artistic message and what's so cool is the farther we get away from the Soviet Union, the more the art winds, because in 300 years there isn't going to be a shred left of that ideology and all that will be left to the paintings is the art,

Speaker 1:          03:25          so

Speaker 2:          03:28          part of the reason that people are so attracted to art is because the artist actually manifests identity with the process of transformation and so that's why the artist is a cultural hero. That's also why every nihilist worth his salt wants to be an artist like, who are you? What are you going to say? I'm a nihilist snow. I'm an artist. It's like, no, you're not, but I can see why you want to be. Right, right. Yeah. Just because you're a failure, it doesn't mean you're an artist.

Speaker 1:          04:01          Right.

Speaker 2:          04:06          Well, I think it depends on who you are. Like, it's really interesting to me, but I'm really interested enough, you know, and I'm also interested in the way that ideologies coopt more fundamental processes to, to, and harness their energy as a, as a rational and motivating force. And so for me, these pieces of art propaganda are extremely interesting. I mean, it's very interesting to be surrounded by them because I can see this war going on all the time. So it's very cool. And there are twinning far as I can tell, so that's very interesting because they were pure propaganda, many of them when I bought them. But it's getting farther and farther away from the Soviet Union. So the more architectural elements are coming to the forefront.
