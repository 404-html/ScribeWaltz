Speaker 1:          00:01          So God's upset because he had made man on earth and it grieved him at his heart, and God says, I will destroy man, whom I've created from the face of the earth, both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for I repent that I've made them. But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. Okay, so that's an interesting thing. So here what we have is the question is the whole world's in chaos at this point, right in this point in the story. And the chaos is multiple sorts. It's, it arose from the fall. It rose from the emergence of self consciousness. It emerged. Safe arose from the sins of cane, like things are not going well. It's multiple levels of collapse. And it's got to the point where God saying this is a mess, like it's such a mess that the whole thing has to be washed away.

Speaker 1:          00:45          The first fall wasn't enough. Even canes collapse wasn't enough. We're going to just scrub the whole bloody thing clean. So it's, it's the ultimate in traumatic collapses. The question is, well, what do you do in the face of the ultimate in traumatic collapses? And the answer is in the story. So Noah is someone who finds fate, who finds favor in the eyes of God, so he's like able. There's something that Noaa is doing right that's going to enable him to ride out the storm. And so the question here, it's the same question. Do you want to have a life where there's no storms

Speaker 1:          01:20          or do you want to have a life where you can ride out the storms? That's the issue, right? Are you behind the dikes or do you build a boat? Do you captain the boat? That's the same idea. So the idea here is that the thing that rides out the chaos is the thing that builds and captains the boat. It's another dominance hierarchy idea. What should be at the top? Well, the top of something that doesn't get flooded out as well. What should be at the top? Well, it's to be the boat builder and to be the captain of the boat, it's not to be hidden from the flood. Precisely. And so, I mean, here's, here's, here's something to think about, identity, identity politics, because that's what we're up to our neck yet, okay, are you who you are? Can I box you? Will, will you accept that as an identity?

Speaker 1:          02:06          So I could do that. Lots of ways. You're male, your Asia, you're young, right? There's things about you that I can derive because of your putative membership in a set of different groups. The problem with doing that is that the number of groups that I can assign youtube is without. And so I have to pick arbitrary groups to assign you to and you can accept that if you want, but there's no evidence that those are the proper canonical groups. But maybe you're happy about that because now you've been assigned membership in a group and that's your identity. Okay? So the question is, well, fine, what happens when that identity is blown into pieces? Then what? Well, here's, here's the answer to some degree, and this is the answer that's embedded in the story of Noah.

Speaker 1:          02:57          If you want it withstand chaos. Do you want to be who you are or do you want to be the thing that changes who you are constantly. That's the question and that's the difference. That's the difference. There's a categorical difference in identity. Are you who you are or are you the thing that could continually be more than you are and that's the thing that isn't the stable identity. It's not the initial state. It's also not the state of being in chaos that nihilistic state, let's say, and it's not even the state of reformulation that occurs after you've gone through the process. It's the state of continually going through the process so you can identify with the thing that trends you could identify, identify with the thing that you are or you can identify with the thing that transforms who you are. Right, and that's the same as the state subjugating itself to the individual because the individual is the thing that transforms the state and what the state should do the states necessarily because obviously it organizes all of us into peaceful cooperation and competition, the states necessary.

Speaker 1:          04:01          Then the question is, is the state the highest good? And the answer to that is, well, it can't be because it's old and dead and blind, and so if the state becomes the highest good, then you're occupied by the spirit of something that's old and dad and blind. Well, that's not only not good for you because then you're old and dead and blind, but it's also bad for the state because as soon as the state gets old and dead and blind, God gets unhappy with it and the chaos comes in and washes it away. So it seems like a bad solution. So what's the proper solution? You subordinate your group identity to the identity that transforms your identity, right? And this state subordinates. It's power to the vision and articulation of the individual because that's what revives the state. And so that's what these stories are trying to stumble towards. Roughly speaking.
