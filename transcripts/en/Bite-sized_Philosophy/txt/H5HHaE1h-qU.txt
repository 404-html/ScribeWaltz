Speaker 1:          00:00          You definitely have a responsibility to your partner and your children. Okay, so your responsibility to your children as far as I'm concerned, is don't. It's twofold. One, don't let your children do anything that makes you dislike the and there's a corollary to that, which is don't be an idiot. You know, so that's partly why you need a partner because your partner has to tell you when your demands on your children are excessive because you're kind of, you know, you're not 100 percent oriented properly, but still you're their target adult. And so it's up to you to help them choose a path that makes you want them to be around right? And that that's your critical responsibility and hopefully your enough of an, an analog of the broader community so that if they can figure out how to get along with you, it radically increases the probability that the ability to get along with everyone.

Speaker 1:          00:55          So for example, if you're playing with your children two years old, you, you help them, you encourage them to play in a manner that's fun. And if you get that down, then you know when you introduce them to another child, don't know how to play in a manner that's fun and so great, you've solved the problem. The problem is to get your child to enter into the collaborative social world. And so yes, you have a primary responsibility for that. And then with regards to your partner, here's something to think about with regards to rules. So my wife and I have had this discussion many times and one of the discussions as well, how are we to treat each other in public? And it isn't. Her name is Tammy. The discussion isn't how should Jordan treat Tammy and public? Or how should tammy treat Jordan? That's not the discussion.

Speaker 1:          01:42          This isn't personal. It's how should a wife treat her husband? And how should a husband treat his wife? It's impersonal and it's partly you don't put your partner down in public. Why? Well, it's not because you're hurting that persons feelings. That's not why. It's that you're denigrating the relationship that you are involuntarily. You know, I've some of the most painful days I've ever spent. One night in particular I spent with a group of men who had been in therapy for their marriage and who bloody well needed it. I can tell you that, and they spent their whole day complaining about their wives. I could just made me sweat the whole day. I thought, I can't believe I'm here with you guys. I can't tell you. Why was it just, you know, it was just happenstance more than anything and I thought, how can you be so damn dumb?

Speaker 1:          02:27          It's like it's certainly possible that you marriage barbara married barbarian witches fine, but you don't have your so lacking in sense that you would discuss that in public, not noticing that you pick them. So basically all you're doing is holding up a sign and waving it constantly that says, I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot. Right? And so well, Dr. Responsibility, you have a responsibility to those whom you love and are obligated to, to ensure that they manifest themselves in a manner that's most beneficial to them over the long run. Now you have the same responsibility. I would say to yourself, but you'll have blind spots. Other people have to help you with that, but so the rule is you know, you don't let you, don't you help your wife figure out how not to make a fool of herself in public and she extends to you the same courtesy, and it's partly maintenance of the sacred nature of the relationship. It has nothing to do with you or her. Precisely. It's broader and wider than that.
