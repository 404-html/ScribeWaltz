Speaker 1:          00:00          And the Lord said unto Abraham, and this is, this is the, this is the opening of the story, get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee. And this is one of those phrases where every clause is significant. Go somewhere you don't understand. That's the first thing. Get the out of country. You know, back in the 19 twenties, there was a whole slew of American writers who ended up as expatriates in Paris. Hemingway among them, who wrote the Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald, yes. And then a variety of others. It was very inexpensive in Paris at the time and part of their transformation into great literary figures was the fact that they were out of their country and now they could see what their country was. Because you can't see what your country is until you leave it.

Speaker 1:          00:49          So you have to go into the unknown and that's God's first command. Go into the unknown because you already know what you know and so, and that's not enough. Unless you think you're enough. And if you're not enough and you don't think you're enough, then you have to go where you haven't been. And so that's the first commandment to Abraham. It's like, okay, that, that's a good one. That makes perfect sense. Go to where you don't know. Yes. And from thy kindred will though, does that mean it means grow up, right? That's what it means. It means get away from your family enough so that you can establish your independence. And that isn't because there's something wrong with your family, although perhaps there is, you know, as long as there is perhaps wrong with you, but it means get away. You know, I talked to people very frequently whose families have provided them with too much protection and they know it themselves.

Speaker 1:          01:38          And that means they are deprived of necessity. You know, one of the things that you see in, in, in the United States for example, is that the children are first generation immigrants often do better than the children that their children. And the reason for that is that the children are first generation immigrants, have necessity driving them. And you don't know how much you need necessity to drive you because maybe you're not very disciplined and if any catastrophe doesn't immediately be fall you. If you don't act forthrightly today, then maybe you never act forthrightly, right? Because the, the gap between your foolishness and the punishment is, is lengthened by your unearned wealth. And so you never grow up and learn and you have to get yourself away from your dependency in order to allow necessity to drive you forward. And that's to become independent and to become mature.

Speaker 1:          02:28          And I think part of what's happening in our culture is that the, the, the force that's attacking the forthright movement forward of young men in particular is afraid of the power of man because it's confused about the distinction between power and authority and competence. Like I know a man who's who has authority and competence has power as a byproduct, but the authority and competence is everything. And, and, and people who can't, that fail to make the distinction between power and authority of competence. And they're afraid of power. And so they destroy authority and competence. And that's a terrible thing because we need authority and competence. What else is going to, what else is going to allow us to prevail in the long run? And so you get away from your country and you get away from your kin and from your father's house, right? And you go out there and you establish yourself in the world. It's a call to adventure. That's what this first lines in the Abrahamic story is a call to adventure. So great unto a land that I will show you. Well, you know, what does that mean?

Speaker 1:          03:41          You know, one of the things that I've been struck very hard by a number of writers, Carl Young, obviously among them, I mean he, he wrote things like Nicha that if you understand them, they just break you into pieces. You know. And, and one of the things that young understood in the psychoanalysts understand, it's one of the most terrifying elements of psychoanalytic thinking is very tightly allied with religious thinking, which is that you are not the master of your own house. There are spirits that dwell in you within you, meaning you have a will, and you can exercise a certain amount of conscious control over your being, but there are all sorts of things that occur within you that seem to be beyond your capacity to control your dreams. For example. That's a really good example of your impulses. For example, you might, you might think of those as so foreign from you that they're not even.

Speaker 1:          04:30          You don't even want them to be part of you, but, but more subtly even. How about what you're interested in? What compels you? Like, where does that come from? Exactly. Because you can't, you can't conjure it up of your own accord, you know? So if you're a student and you're taking difficult course, you might say to yourself, well, I need to sit down and study for three hours, but then you sit down and that is what happens. Your attention goes everywhere. And you might say, well, whose attention is it? Then? If it goes everywhere because you say it's your attention, it's like, well, hey, if it's your attention, maybe you'd be able to control it, but you can't, and so then you might think, well jen and just exactly what the hell is controlling it, and you might say, well, it's random. It's the better not be random.

Speaker 1:          05:13          I can tell you that that's. That happens to some degree in schizophrenia. There's an element of randomness in that. It's not random. It's driven by the action of of phenomena that I think are best considered as something like subpersonalities. They'll even. That's only a partial description. You can't make yourself interested in something. Interest manifests itself in grips you. That's a whole different thing and so what is it that's gripping you and how do you conceptualize that? Is that a divine power? Well, it's divine as far as you're concerned because it grips you and you can't do anything about it, and so there is a calling in you towards what you're compelled by and what you're interested in, and sometimes that might be very dark and sometimes not, but you're compelled forward by your interest. And so and so, the idea that what moves you away from your country and your father's house and the comforts of your childhood home is, is something that's beyond you and that you listen to an Harken to.

Speaker 1:          06:16          That's exactly right. And you can say, well, I don't want to call it that God. It's like it doesn't matter what you call it. Exactly. It doesn't matter to what it is, what it's called. It still is, and if you don't listen to it, that's the other thing. If you don't listen to it, and I've been a clinician and talked to enough people now as old as I am, to know this. Absolutely, if you do not listen to that thing that beckons you forward, you will pay for it like you cannot possibly imagine. You'll have everything that's terrible about life in your life and nothing about it that's good and worse. You'll know that it was your fault and that you squandered what you could have had.
