Speaker 1:          00:00          Did you guys ever see the Blair witch project? How many of you have seen that? How many of you haven't? Oh, so it's a pretty lousy example. Anyways, it's a horror movie now. There's kind of two kinds of horror movies. There's the splatter type horror movie and I think actually those expose you to discuss and then there's the fear kind of horror movie and that doesn't need to have any Gore at all. It just makes you afraid. And the Blair witch project is very good example of that because all that happens, nothing happens, nothing happens, but you think something terrible is going to happen every second and the sense that something terrible is gonna happen, keeps climbing through the whole movie and so what they do is put you in a state of radical uncertainty and never let you off. Okay, well, so basically they're playing with your imagination and that can work very effectively.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Like it's often horror movies, often more effective if they don't show you what's making those horrible noises off screening, you know, because no matter what they show you, the probability that he can be as personally horrible as what other monsters you're dredging up out of your imagination is very low. So, and you know, what's reasonable to be afraid of the dark because throughout our biological history, lots of unfortunate people were devoured by things in the dark or hurt very badly by them, etc. Etc. And wE're also daytime creatures, right? So we don't like the dark very much. So what do you do to someone if you're going to initiate them is maybe you take them when they're 13 and you put them in a really dark cave and caves. There Are so dark man, like if you're in a cave, you just can't believe how dark it is.

Speaker 1:          01:38          It's, it's. You can't see anything in a cave. So you don't know how big the space you're in is and you don't know how small it is and you don't know whether or not it's going to collapse or when it's going to stay up. And you don't know how far you are underground, especially if the people who took you there didn't, you know, walked around in circles and did let you know where you were going and then maybe they leave and maybe they leave for three days. And so you're sitting down there thinking, well, what are you thinking? Exactly? Well, you're thinking the most horrible thoughts you could possibly imagine, right? I'm never going to get out of here. They're never going to find me again. some horrible snake thing that lives in the darkness is going to come and eat me slowly because fast would be merciful and I'm and then I'm also going to go completely out of my mind so that even if something doesn't eat me, I'm going to come over here. it will be worse than being dead anyways. And so partly what you're doing in that circumstances, you're facing that demons of your own imagination.

Speaker 1:          02:40          And if you can stand that, then you grow up. And that's what an initiation ceremony tests. Now, a lot of what you'll find if you look at clinical theories of psychology, the same motif applies if you want to get better, you have to find out what you're avoiding and what you're afraid of and maybe what you're by you and you have to expose yourself to that voluntarily and you have to let that change you, and so it's not a pleasant prospect. I mean, it's not dancing through a field of daisies, right? With muzak play and it'S not follow your bliss. You know? It's not the natural unfolding of a positive process. It's not that at all. It's the voluntary confrontation with the things that make up life horrors. But what's interesting about it is that there's. There's an idea there that lurks under the surface archetypally, and that is there's a lot more to you than meets the eye, but it won't be released unless it has to, and so you're not going to even figure out what it is until you put yourself in peril.

Speaker 1:          03:43          Now, part of that you might think like imagine that you're. You're an introvert. You're socially awkward, you're highly neurotic, so you feel a lot of anxiety and depression. You don't like going to partieS. That's because the horrible pirate lives at parties and always glaring at you and judging you and telling you how useless and insufficient you are. And so you go there. You don't even look at people because you know that if you did look at them, you just see the face of the judgmental tyrant, which by the way, you wouldn't if you actually looked at them, but you won't because you avoid and so you're going to go there and you're going to put yourself in this terrible situation and if you're lucky and you're a bit of weight, then you're going to incorporate all sorts of information from the external world that will help you develop your social skills and make you more sophisticated.

Speaker 1:          04:26          And even if that doesn't happen, you're going to learn that. You can tolerate your own fear. And you might say, well, what's better to not be afraid or to know that you can handle being afraid and obviously to not be afraid, but give that up because that ain't happening so that the next best thing and the realistic thing is to know that you're the master of your own fear. And so a lot of what we're going to talk about in relationship to classical theories of personality is exactly that. It's not that the world isn't terrible, it's that the world is terrible, but you're a lot stronger than you think and the way you. Okay? And so part of that is the strength that you gather is partly the information that you gather when you go somewhere that you're not good at. You know, so you're establishing new skills like you haven't university.

Speaker 1:          05:11          But there's another part that's interesting that's related to the little video that I showed you at the beginning. Dna turns out to be a very complex structure. And so if I put you in situation a, then dna codes, certain kinds of proteins that help make up the way that your mind is in the way it works. But if I take you and put you in another situation, completely different genes turn on, and so what that means is that you have a biological repository of potential use lying dormant at the highest resolution level of your molecular structure, and that if you push yourself and all sorts of different directions and you find different things to pursue and test yourself against, then you're going to turn on parts of yourself that aren't currently on and god only knows what you'd be like. If you turned yourself completely on. Maybe I could use a better metaphor.

Speaker 1:          06:23          I'll tell you a little bit more about the shavano routines because they're more in a way, if there is a initiation archetype, which I kind of just described, which is you can do this for yourself and this is a good way to live. BeaTs the alternative anyway. So which is like the definition of a good way to live so mad and you're trying to pursue something so you've got a goal. That's a good thing. You've got to have a goal and you don't want to hold onto that too tightly because he might be wrong. You've got to be willing to let that go and have a different goal, but you need to go and then you know while you're pursuing the goal, you're going to find out that there's some obstacles in your path, obviously, and maybe some of those obstacles are afraid, frightening, tight.

Speaker 1:          07:01          Well, maybe the reason of a disgusting type, you might say, I don't want to turn it into that kind of person, so those of you who are sort of socialist utopia had left wingers might think that way about business people. It's like, I wouldn't. I would recommend that you get over it as rapidly as possible. So anyways, you might think there's no way I'm going to act that way. So you sort of put it off limits saying, or maybe you're afraid to do what you need to do next. Well, here's the rule. Don't avoid doing things because they make you feel negative emotion. If you have to do those things in order to pursue your goals, in fact, you should do exactly the opposite. So let's say you're pursuing a goal and you find that you're afraid about something and so you're avoiding it. The first thing you should think is a hot look.

Speaker 1:          07:46          I'm afraid of something and I'm avoiding it. Dragon treasure. Exactly there. And that's exactly right. It's precisely right. If you're. If you're afraid of the thing, then what that means is that you're not developed enough to handle it and you need to be. So you should think about that as a discovery, like a positive discovery. You found out where you have a weakness and you're now able to address it. So you know if you're an introvert and you think it's friday night, I could go to this party, but you know I really don't want it. Then you think, oh, that means I should go. And that's exactly right because

Speaker 1:          08:25          because you already know how to do the things that you know how to do and it's the things that you don't know how to do that bother you and oppress you. And of course those things are going to be difficult to learn about, but you need to learn about them because you need to get yourself all switched on. How's that switched on? Because then you'll be able to tolerate the fact that life is fundamentally suffering and so you don't know. The world doesn't get safer us. You developed, in fact quite the contrary. You just get more competent and that's better anyways because it's that you don't want safety anyways. You probably want adventure. You probably want to be compelled. You probably want to be engaged. You know, if you want security, you might as well be dead well because nothing's happening then and that there's no danger level.

Speaker 1:          09:10          To be alive is to be contending with the, with the world and you want to be the best at that that you can possibly be. And that's partly what we're gonna learn about as we go through the entire course. But certainly the elements that have to do with clinical psychology because all of the circulate around this fundamental fee, they have to. Because it's the fundamental story of mankind and we want to know what that fundamental story is because we're all human and you need to know the story and then you know, you can decide how you're gonna act it out, but at least you need to know the damn story first.
