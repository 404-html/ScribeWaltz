Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah, no, I want to come back also to what you were saying about the predictive power of Iq and conscientiousness, which I don't dispute that I'm also not one of these people who suffers under the delusion that these things are totally open quotes, socially determined, closed quotes. I mean, I understand and believe that they have high heritability and identifiable genetic sources in that variability and so on. But you know, the standard old joke used to be, you can tell because you don't worry about personality psychology that I do at the standard old junk used to be that everything, everything's 50 percent heritable, that, that, that pretty much anything that you could measure as a trait that has any stability within the lifetime also turns out to have a heritability somewhere to your point five. But there's the other point five of, you know, some people have low iqs because they were exposed to too much.

Speaker 1:          00:52          They see, you know, um, I believe that conscientiousness, this can probably be like, I believe you suggested earlier that we know something about this already about developmental determinative of shifts in conscientious. And uh, so, you know, we have to caution ourselves against talking about these individual difference factors as if they are a beautiful attributes of individuals that are going to undermine Eddie, sort of progressive improvement of, of circumstances for people are, are, are, are, are, are going to create bad byproducts of attempts to produce social justice. It's just gonna you know, you're going to leave your country and just people out there being parasites or something

Speaker 2:          01:43          there, there is of course decent evidence that there's cultural effects on Iq, I mean the flynn effect, which is named after the man who, who described the, the, the, the phenomena indicates that the average Iq has been increasing quite substantially over the last hundred years. And the reason for that, no one knows for sure, but one of the putative reasons for that is that we've lifted the bottom out of catastrophe. So there aren't people whose Iq is, are stunted by, by exposure to zero information during critical developmental periods and who didn't get enough to eat.

Speaker 1:          02:24          Yes. I was going to say superior about nutrition. Everybody probation. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:27          yeah, exactly. Exactly. So we've, we've wiped out in many ways, we've wiped out the worst effects of privation and that's increasingly true as well on, on the worldwide scale worldwide stage, you know there's about 150,000 people a day right now being lifted out of absolute poverty by UN standards, the fastest improvement in the history of the world by a huge margin and also about 300,000 people a day being hooked up to the electrical grid. So we are making some progress, removing the absolute privation problem, which is a nontrivial problem. The problem with most of the attempts to raise Iq is that they don't change the variance in Iq. They tend to raise the average Iq across the population and that leaves the inequality of Iq inequality problem basically untouched. So there have been studies trying to estimate how much socioeconomic pressure, let's say you have to place on an individual to raise their iq lowering.

Speaker 2:          03:29          It's easy, right? Because making something worse is always easier than making something better. But if I remember correctly, if you take a, an identical twin who's adopted out at birth in order to produce a 15 point increase in Iq compared to the other twin, which is a one standard deviation increase and about the same as the average difference between a university student in a, in an average state college and an average high school student, you have to move the one twin from the fifth percentile of socioeconomic status to the 95th percentile. So you need about a three standard deviation improvement and socioeconomic conditions to produce a one standard deviation improvement in Icu. So it looks like it can be done, but it's. But it's expensive, you know, and

Speaker 1:          04:17          I see, I see what you're saying. I'm kind of surprised I'm actually, I've been given, you know, we just mentioned malnutrition as one possible source of low Iq. What possible developmental source. I'm Kinda surprised that, uh, to the degree that the flit effect might be due to things like, or reduction of the number of people exposed to severe malnutrition, that it wouldn't have also simultaneously truncated the variance a little bit. That seems like they said, well,

Speaker 2:          04:43          sorry, let me restate that. It has truncated. It has truncated the variance, although the data on that isn't clear isn't as clear, but so, but, but I, I do believe that it's a reasonable inference to make that the variance has been truncated. It's also hidden to some degree because the Iq tests are always renewed them to keep the variance out of standard 15 points so. So it makes it difficult to look retrospectively and see what's happened to the variance. So by the time, the other problem too is that, you know, you get these stories now and then about these companies that come out with the claims that their brain exercises can improve Iq and the literature on that is damn dismal. I can tell you it's that the holy grail is to produce cognitive exercises that produce a legitimate impact on fluid intelligence and, and like there's been a lot of work done on that and the answer is so far is that it doesn't work.

Speaker 1:          05:35          What about, what about like video gaming? I mean, I know there has been this suggestion that playing video games actually improves at least some aspects of intelligence. There's a couple of studies that indicated that video games might improve spatial intelligence, but, but here's

Speaker 2:          05:50          problem and I think this is, this is a critical problem or perhaps an insoluble one or at least no one's solved is that what you get is that if you are, if you exercise yourself substantially on a given game, you can radically accelerate your performance in the game so you can get much better at those specific skill share, but you don't get generalization across cognitive sets, which is what you're really hoping for. Because I thought, I thought that was the claim for some. They have shown some increases in spatial Iq, but there's not very many studies. And I would say they're far overbalanced by the other side of the research equation, which continually says, and I've looked at this because I'm really interested in the improvement of ICU. I mean, that's, that's the holy grail in some sense. And that, and, and, uh, the, the, the overwhelming preponderance of evidence suggests that you don't get generalization outside the narrow domain. Now why that is, and even this, it's even worse say because you might say, well, imagine that you could take five different domains of intelligence still associated type with, with Jay, and you had people practice routines in all five dimensions. Maybe you'd get generalization under those circumstances. And the, the, the, the results of the research attempting that indicate that no, as soon as you move away from those specific practice instances, you don't get generalization.
