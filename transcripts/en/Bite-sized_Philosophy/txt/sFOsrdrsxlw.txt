Speaker 1:          00:02          So this week we've had the google thing, there was the youtube thing that happened last week, what's going on with censorship and what should people do about it?

Speaker 2:          00:13          If you're in a workplace in pathological, things are happening. This is easy. I can tell you how you know of pathological things are happening at your workplace or they're happening with you one of the two. But you can straighten that out if you're being required to do things that make you weak and ashamed,

Speaker 3:          00:34          then stop. Don't do them.

Speaker 2:          00:38          Like one of the things I learned from Solzhenitsyn and Frankl was that

Speaker 2:          00:46          systems go terribly under, out of control when people don't stop them, when they're going mildly out of control. You know, when you might say, I should just keep my goddamn head down and shut up. It's like maybe you should like, that's not bad advice. You know, you don't want to make unnecessary enemies and you don't need any more trouble than you need, but you got to ask yourself on a day to day basis what makes you think you're not selling your soul? You know? And there's so much foolishness going on in the mid level bureaucratic world now that's where all the tyranny seems to be focused. And the reason that it multiplies is because sensible people say nothing

Speaker 2:          01:27          when they should say something. And what's so strange about that is that there are way more sensible people than people who aren't sensible. They're just not as noisy. So what you'll turn out if like, so let's say something's bugging the hell out of you at work, well then you have to prepare it to find another job. That's the first thing you have to do. I don't think that you should find another job, but you should prepare to find another job. And if possible, you should prepare to find a better job. Because if you can't tell someone to go to hell, then you can't negotiate with them. And if and if they've got you over a barrel, then you can't say anything. So you gotTa, you gotta set yourself up. So you've got some mobility and actually that's a really good principal in your life, period.

Speaker 2:          02:09          You should set yourself up so that you have a lateral move at hand. And then you should find out, well, are there things at work that are disturbing my soul? You know, and you find that out. First of all, you ask yourself, okay, I'm disturbed at work. Okay, I'm probably week and deceitful and useless and lazy. He might as well start with that. And then you talk to some people like your wife, your friends, your coworkers, and find out are you stupid, deceitful and lazy, or is there something not so good going on at work? And so if you, if you can then eliminate your own personal pathology as a cause of your dissatisfaction, then maybe there's something rotten in the state of Denmark and maybe you should say something about it before the whole goddamn thing collapses. Because that can happen. It can happen in companies a lot faster than people ever think.

Speaker 2:          02:56          You know? And you may find that, well, first of all may find if you say something, well first of all, that's an adventure. That's for sure. That's a bloody adventure. And you have to do it carefully and, and you have to be prepared for it. But it might be the best thing that ever happened to you. And the other thing is if you're careful about it, you get your words right. Like in this is a, this is strategic battle, right? It's not something you wander into carelessly. Then you may find that there's lots of people who feel exactly the same way you do and that you've actually caught and onto something. You're a canary in a coal mine and not just some like psychopathic mouthpiece. So you got to ask yourself, when you go and do what you do like, is this making you stronger?

Speaker 2:          03:34          Is this making you weaker? And if it's making you weaker, then you got to ask yourself, do you really want to be weaker? Because the weaker you get, the more your tyrannized. And then worse than that, like the weaker you get, the more bitter you get. And the more you'll work towards terrible things, the more you'll snap it your wife, the more you'll kick your kids. You know, like it's no joke to be tyrannized at work. And so I would say you have an ethical responsibility as a citizen to forthrightly confront, creeping tyranny, no matter where it occurs. And part of, part of what we're learning, I would say from these stories, if we're learning anything at all, is that if you're aimed at the good, which is a question you really got to ask yourself, you know, if you're genuinely aimed at the good, then take heart because you're a lot stronger than you think. So

Speaker 1:          04:28          I have a followup question. Okay. So I'm speaking to, there's lots of people who were in this situation like, you know, people at universities and corporations all over the place. I, you know, Google is not the only company that is not the worst repressive, uh, freedom of speech, denying workplace codes and everybody feels alone, right? They're all like, why should I stand up, be a martyr, get fired. This guy at Google got fired. Yeah. What's the point? And like, I'm asking rhetorically. No, it's a good question. And how do you, how do you convince people that there's a point to, to standing up when it appears to be futile?

Speaker 3:          05:13          Okay.

Speaker 2:          05:14          Well, the first thing I think is you convince them that it's not few tiles. It might be difficult, but it's not futile. If you get your words right, you have something to say. There'll be an impact of those words. It might not be the impact that you would choose, but the. But the other thing you got to tell people is pick your poison. You don't. You may be in a situation where you don't have a. You don't have a cake. Walk to the garden of Paradise. You got tyranny or famine. Those are your choices, but you get to pick which one you have. And I would say if, if you're being oppressed and I mean in your soul by what you're required to swallow at work, well you think you're not paying a price for that. You got no self respect and, and, and, and rightly so, but worse than that, you're an agent of your own destruction. You're destroying your own ideal and you're letting people who are weak and corrupt when

Speaker 2:          06:17          and if you stood up and stood up properly, but you have to put yourself in order to do this. At least to some degree, right? You can't do it casually. You have to do it from some position of preparedness and strength. Then what makes you think you couldn't scare them back into the corners and that would be a good thing and you know the alternative personally is bad because there's a psychological degeneration that goes along with it. I've seen this with many, many of the people that I've worked with who have been tyrannized in the workplace to the absolute detriment of their psychological and physical health. Right? To the point of collapse confronting these crazy, crazy things when they were sensible people. That's a terrible price to pay man. Like it's, it's a bad price. And then if the foolishness isn't dealt with at the local level when it's still relatively trivial, then it will multiply until it's dealt with at the social level and we're seeing signs of that already on two fa is a good sign of that, you know, and problems that aren't solved. Multiply and soon people fight and you know, edit, argue, then to fight. Unless you want to fight and some people want to fight and I can understand why, but I wouldn't recommend it because

Speaker 2:          07:41          that doesn't lead good places. It really doesn't lead good places, so I would say you have a duty. Maybe that's, that's where you stand up. It's because you have a god damn duty to stand up and say, just say what you have to say it. You don't even have to be trying to make a point. Exactly. You're trying to get something done. It's like, this is how it looks to me. That's what that guy had. Google did. He wrote this memo and he said he. I talked to him today. He said, well, he went to a diversity training seminar and he thought, no, I don't agree with that. And so then they asked for feedback. So we wrote this document a month ago. This was written a month ago. Got No real response to it. Well, it bounced around inside Google until a lot of people got interested in that. It escaped into the outside world, but all he was doing was. He was told a bunch of things he didn't think were true. He wrote down a bunch of things he thought were probably true. He launched that out and said, well, I think these things are probably true. It's like, well,

Speaker 2:          08:42          probably their true well, so he paid a price for it, but maybe we'll see what sort of price he paid for it, man. It's going to be a lot tougher in two years than he was two years ago. So. No, no, they didn't answer his feedback. No, no, but, well, you can watch the video, the stories there, but that's kind of the outline of it.

Speaker 1:          09:06          So, sorry to monopolize this. I have one other question about this and I think it's important, aside from Google just being a workplace, right? It also controls the on Youtube, right? Which, which is post a new censorship scheme, um, and it controls a huge amount of the information that people get. And so true. And so what happens to society when companies such as Google, which control our information start to censor, not just how about ourselves and maybe the information that's coming out to the rest of the world. How much is this already happening and how much?

Speaker 2:          09:48          How about if we would have, if we refuse to find out, that would be good. You know, like I reviewed this, this guy's document, I did that yesterday and everything he said was validated by the scientific literature. So what has happened is that someone has been fired publicly by a major corporation for stating well grounded scientific truths right there. Exactly the sorts of things that I say in my classes for example. And the reason that I say to them is because I read the literature. It's not because I'm personally happy about the fact. I think Iq research particularly is so dismal that you can't possibly read it without being seriously disheartened. If I could reconstruct the world. So that ICU, the ICU research wasn't true. Well, it should be tempting, you know, but that's not how science works. Science doesn't tell you what you, what you want to hear, it just tells you the way it bloody well is, and he got pilloried for. He got pilloried for revealing a good fraction of current scientific knowledge about gender differences. Okay. That's not good. And as you said, that's a big company and it controls our communication. It's how about we do what we can to ensure that these large communication companies don't get to impose a factually false ideological structure on the rest of the planet where you can think about supporting this. This guy who blew the whistle, there's a fundraiser for him online. He could use some money. He wants to sue google.

Speaker 4:          11:32          Yeah, thank you. Maybe we could. Maybe we could let

Speaker 2:          11:39          them know that hiring a human resources director who's also concerned with equity is probably not a good idea for capitalist company. Why in the world would you hire your own enemies? I don't understand that so. Well, we'll see how the dialogue continues, but back to the personal like you need to say what you think because that's where you come from. Right? And if you don't say what you think, then you kill your unborn self. That's what you do. That's what Cain did when he killed Abel. And that's why his punishment was unbearable. You know you have things in you that are struggling to come to the light. That's the truth. You need daughter and you need to either that truth because without that truth, who cannot live in the world because the world is real and you need truth to live in the world. And if you stifle your truth, well, how, how can that be anything but something that brings about hell, how could it be any other way? So you think, well, why should you speak up? That's easy because the consequences of not speaking up, although delayed are far worse. That's the reason. That's the reason. If, if, if it can't be courage, it could at least be prudent. So. Yep.
