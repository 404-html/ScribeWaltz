Speaker 1:          00:00          The best way, the best way to teach people critical thinking is to teach them to write, and I made this little thing that I put online. It's, I don't know if maybe it is it in the psych for 34 website. Did I post that rubric for Essay Writing?

Speaker 2:          00:15          It is still on.

Speaker 1:          00:17          Is it not on for 34. Is that not working

Speaker 2:          00:20          when you were doing?

Speaker 1:          00:22          Oh

Speaker 2:          00:23          yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:26          Oh, okay. Well there's an essay. Whoa, that's too bad. It's not on the site for 34 website even because I updated it anyways. I have this guide to writing this. If it isn't on the 4:34 website, it is definitely on the [inaudible] website and it steps people through the process of writing because what's happened now, it's very hard to teach people to write because it's unbelievably time intensive and like writing marketing a good essay. That's really easy. Check a. You did everything right, right. Marketing a bad essay. Oh my God. The words are wrong. The phrases are wrong. The sentence is wrong. They're not ordered right in the paragraphs. The paragraphs aren't coherent and the whole thing makes no sense, so trying to tell the person what they did wrong. It's like, Whoa, you did everything wrong. Everything about this essay is wrong. Well, that's not helpful either.

Speaker 1:          01:15          You have to find the few little things they did half right and you have to teach them what they did wrong. It's really expensive and so what I did with this rubric was trying to address that from the production side instead of the grading side, but the best thing you can do is teach people to write because there's no difference between that and thinking and one of the things that just blows me away about universities is that no one ever tell students why they should write something. It's like, well, you have to do this assignment. Well, why are you writing well? You need the grade. It's like, no, you need to learn to think because thinking makes you act effectively in the world. Thinking makes you win the battles you undertake and those could be battles for good things. If you can think and speak and write, you are absolutely deadly.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Nothing can get in your way, so that's why you learn to write. It's like when I can't believe that people aren't just told that it's, it's, it's like it's the most powerful weapon you could possibly provide someone with and I mean, I know lots of people who've been staggeringly successful and watched them throughout my life. I mean those people, you don't want to have an argument with them. They'll just slash you into pieces and not in a malevolent way. It's like if you're gonna make your point and they're going to make their point. You better have your points organized because otherwise you are going to look like and be an absolute idiot. You are not going to get anywhere. And if you can formulate your arguments coherently and make a presentation, if you can speak to people, if you can lay out a proposal. God, people give you money, they give you opportunities, you have influence. That's what you're at university for. And so that's what you do is you know your urine English, right? You're in your new languages anyway. So it's like, yeah, teach, teach people to be articulate because that's the most dangerous thing you can possibly be. So, and that's motivating. If people know that, it's like, well, why are you learning to write? Because your, here's your sword, here's your m 16, right? Here's your bulletproof vest. Like you learn how to use them,

Speaker 3:          03:25          but it's just,

Speaker 1:          03:31          it's an endless mystery to me why that isn't made self evident.

Speaker 3:          03:38          So

Speaker 1:          03:39          that's the sort of thing that can drive you mad. Trying to sort out. It's like people are, there's a, there's a conspiracy to bring people into the education system to make them weaker.

Speaker 3:          03:49          So

Speaker 1:          03:51          I guess that keeps the competition down. Maybe that's one way of thinking about it. If your students are stupid, they're not going to challenge you.
