Speaker 1:          00:00          What kind of relationship do you have with your father, your real father? So often ambivalent, right? Because the earth, there's an element of him that encouraged you, hopefully because without the encouragement of your father, man, the world is at dismal place. It's very difficult to be a courageous person unless you have your father in body and spirit behind you. It's very dear, demoralizing, like it really kills people not to have their mother. They just don't recover from that, but and I think people can recover from a fragmented father relationship, but it's the next worst thing you know, because if your father rejects you or doesn't form a relationship with you, it says, if the spirit of civilization has left you outside the walls as of little worth, it's very difficult for people to recover from that. So the father should be an encouraging forest but can be a tyrannical and crushing for us. And so that's very. That's a very difficult thing to get right? Partly because

Speaker 1:          01:00          if you're my son, then I should impose the highest standards of behavior on you and I should always be judging what you're doing. Why should it be judging it with, with the aim of making the best in you come forward, but, but getting that balance exactly right is very difficult and so it's easy to, for a father to swing too much into judgment, let's say. And then of course mothers can play this role to, to swing too far into the domain of judgment and to be too harsh and to the degree that the father has his own path ologies, he's going to do that in perfectly. You know, he might be someone who's, who's the father who devours his son because he's jealous of the new possibility, that new potential that the struggle for, for, uh, attention and love from the mother or from the other children in the family. There's all sorts of things that can go terribly wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:53          So that's the farther as wise king. And that's another symbol that's been lost, I would say to a massive degree in modern universities because all we're taught is to tear that down and to not even notice that it manifests itself everywhere. Especially in the universities which are like there is close to an ideal environment as you could, as human beings have ever been able to create. It's as simple as that and if you can't be grateful for, for the structure of the university with all its imperfections, then then you're completely blind to this element of the archetypes

Speaker 1:          02:26          and that's the opposite of it. That's the sun that devours the king, that devours his own son. That's a tyrant. You know? That's like the mother who too over protective. It's the male version of that and the mother that's too over protective says, I'll never let anything happen to you. It's like, well, maybe you actually want to have something happen to you. You know, it's a bit of an all inclusive statement. It's like, no, I'm going to make you strong so any number of things can happen to you and when you're, when you need some care, I'll be there. But otherwise, like out into the world with you, that's the right attitude for the father. Like get bloody act together, but I'm on your side. It's because not because I want to destroy you or demeaning you or push you down in the dominance hierarchy, but because I want the best, didn't you to emerge and so are you need standards.

Speaker 1:          03:12          It's like, what are you doing wasting your life? There's way more than that to you get your act together and bring it out. And that's a message that people really want to hear if they have any sense at all and generally they do want to hear it. So, you know, I was talking, I've been talking to a lot of people recently as, as perhaps you know, and what I was talking to one of the leaders of the Conservatives this morning and they're asking me about the person who's asking me about bill see 16, but more specifically about talking to young people in. Because the conservative leadership struggle is going on right now. I've been talking to a bunch of them and I said, well look, one of the things you could do for young people that no one's doing is to talk to them about responsibility because everyone talks to young people about rights.

Speaker 1:          03:58          So like, we need our rights. It's like, Oh God, how many rights do you need? You know, really, like you have more privileges than any people who've ever lived anywhere. Well, it's so dull to hear that so dull. It's so pathetic. And, and uh, what would you call it? It's so demeaning that you have to be protected and have your rights. It's like I said, there's a huge marketplace for responsibility. That's what you want to talk to young people about. It's like get your act together and do something worthwhile with your life. For the first time, my entire adult life, the conservatives actually have something to sell young people, right? They could sell them responsibility. It's like, well, why? Because that's where my life has meaning with responsibility. The more responsibility you take on, the more meaning your life has and the, the higher degree of responsibility that you agreed voluntarily to try to bear, the richer your life will be.

Speaker 1:          04:53          And no one's ever told that. And it's the case, you know, it's like you have, you have four kids say, well, that's plenty of responsibility. You're going to have meaning. It's going to be rough, you know, because it's complicated. You have a complicated job and you try to help the careers of the people well around you. Do you try to solve tough problems and aimed suffering and do all of that. It's like its weight, its responsive stability, but it's, there's glory in it. There's real glory in it. There's deep meaning in it and, and, and young people are starving for that because no one ever tells them that. It's like you're way more than you think, man, stand up. Do something difficult. Doing something difficult and heroic, right? Burst out of your borns. So like, that's a good message. That's a necessary message because we have to be more than we are because if we, if we aren't, we're not going to survive.
