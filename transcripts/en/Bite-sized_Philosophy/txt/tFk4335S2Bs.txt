Speaker 1:          00:01          You know, the, the right wing is really hard on the Frankfurt school, you know, in the Frankfurt school where these kinds of neo Marxist guys who combined Marxism with Friday and Islam in the 19 forties and, and they were avowed neo Marxists, you know, so it's not like I'm making an accusation and they were kind of anti system type people and, and all of that. But I think to lay what's happening at the universities and in brought out in the broader culture itself at the feet of the Frankfurt school is insufficient. I really think that it's primarily a consequence of the French intellectuals who, and this is obviously an oversimplification who emerged out of Marxism in the early 19 seventies and produce postmodernism. Now the thing about the postmodernist types is there nested inside Marxism. They say that straight out. I'm not inventing this reed Darragh who's like the joker at the, at the head of the postmodernist movement.

Speaker 1:          01:00          And I mean joker because he, he's, he's an intellectual clown. And that doesn't mean he's stupid because he is not stupid. Not at all. These people are not stupid. They know exactly what they're doing, they know precisely what they're doing. They're a hell of a lot more educated about what they're doing. Then you are less. You happen to be one of them and they mean exactly what they say, just like people always do when they tell you what they're going to do or they write it down and they say straight out on their websites, say that women's studies websites, we think the patriarchy is an oppressive structure that should be broken down to its core and they mean core conceptions. It's not just social, it's linguistic, philosophical and attitudinal. It should be broken down, was wiped out and restructured from the bottom up and they mean that.

Speaker 1:          01:51          So when it's not accidental. Any of this, and I know it sounds like a bloody paranoid conspiracy theory, but you know, I've. I've always been of the idea, especially from reading young ideas. People don't have ideas. Ideas have people, and these are powerful ideas. There's a good book called explaining postmodernism that I might recommend by a guy named named Steven RC Hicks and his first chapter, which isn't very long as a good introduction to political correctness, but so well. So why do I think this is about, about that? Well, her. Here's my reasons. I mean, it doesn't seem to be about me. I think all I did actually was actually. I made the general specific k, which is kind of what you have to do if you really want to make a point, a point, right? That's one place. If you want to make a point, and my point was I'm not saying made up words generated by postmodern Neil Marxists because I despise everything they stand for and so I'm not using those damn words and that's that.
