Speaker 1:          00:00          I watched this great documentary once a called Hitman Hart and was about Bret Hart who was the most famous Canadian in the world for awhile and he was, he was a world wide wrestling federation wrestler, you know, and he was a good guy and he came from this famous family of wrestlers who all came from Alberta. I think there were seven brothers who were wrestlers and seven sisters and all of the sisters married wrestlers and they were all offspring. Children of Stu Hart, who, who, who, who was a wrestling impresario like 40 years ago. And it was, it was such a cool documentary because I was always wondering why in the world did people watch wrestling and, and, and believe it, you know, believe it. Do you believe movies when you go watch them? It's like, that's a hard question to answer while you're there. You do. And so if you're watching wrestling and you're a wrestling fan, do you believe it?

Speaker 1:          00:51          Well, it isn't a matter of belief. It's a matter of being engaged in a drama and there are different levels of drama. Right? So let's say worldwide Wrestling Federation drama is not the most sophisticated form of drama. Okay? But I'm not being not being a smart Alec when I'm saying that there is drama of different sophistication for different people and that's also why religious truths exists at multiple levels simultaneously. Right? There's got to be something in it for everyone and that's a hard belief system. That's a hard system to put together. Something for the unbelievably sophisticated and something for the common person. Okay. So we have wrestling and Brett Hart was a good guy and he fell into the archetype of being a good guy and that's partly what the. What the story's about. It was a bit too much for him, but I'm. One of the things that he, he laid out so carefully was because he figured that a hundred and $20 million people knew him, something like that and that everywhere he went, he was treated like a hero.

Speaker 1:          01:45          And he found that quite a bit of quite a burden. And as you can imagine, if you think about it, but he portrayed what was happening in the wrestling ring as classic good against evil but not conceptualized in disgust, right? Embodied, fought out, acted out, you know, like, like the, like thor and the hulk, except like right in front of you. And so, well that's exactly this sort of thing. I mean, look, we could consider hockey more sophisticated than wrestling perhaps. And that has, as I said, I'm not being a critic of these. I am not being critically minded about these things. I understand their purpose and I would highly recommend that documentary. It's a brilliant documentary, but this is, it's the same thing. It's a Silver Cup, right? It's like there's the hero of the team that's the hero of the teams. You know, here's something cool if you're.

Speaker 1:          02:34          The founder of the Toronto Blue Jays are the Toronto Maple leafs. Of course this hardly ever happens to you if you're a fan of the Toronto Maple leafs because they always lose. But, but, but if you're watching a game and your team wins and we take your testosterone levels, then they went up and if you watched the Toronto Maple leafs and they lost and you're a fan than your testosterone levels go. So that's pretty damn funny, you know, I mean really don't you see how deeply instantiated this as in people? I mean, it bloody well alters your biochemistry, like your, your, your testosterone levels. It's all my team lost, you know, it's like there'll be no, there'll be nothing in it for the wife tonight, you know?

Speaker 2:          03:17          Oh yeah.
