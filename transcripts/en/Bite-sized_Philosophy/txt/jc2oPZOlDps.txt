Speaker 1:          00:00          Cain killed Abel, Abel Caine's children killed seven canes, grandchildren kill 70 fold, and then tubilcain pops up on the horizon and he's the person who makes artifices of war and so the story in its fragmentary manner ties the individual's psychopathology that's resentful and revenge seeking to the proclivity for broad scale warfare, and this really hit me because I was interested particularly in what was happening in the Nazi camps with the guards because the guards were gratuitously cruel and I was very curious about that. And so here's an interesting story. This was in a book called a ordinary Germans, Hitler's willing executioners, and it was a book that was written about 30 years ago. The challenge, the idea that the Nazi phenomenon was taught down order following, which I don't believe, by the way I think that that's a very a week we kype orthosis fascistic societies are fascistic at every single level of organization spiritually within the family, within the local community.

Speaker 1:          01:05          It's like a holograph. It's the same. Absolutely everywhere. It's not top down. I mean, there are leaders who get produced and maybe they catalyze it, but to blame it on the leaders is to forget about the process by which the leaders come to be. So No, you don't get a pass that way. So here's one of the things that happened as the Nazis started to lose the war. So here's what you should have done. If you are a Nazi and he wanted to win the war, you should have enslaved the Jews and the Gypsies and had them work, right? You should have had them work for the benefit of the victory. And then if you want to liquidate them afterwards, that's the logical thing to do. If you want to win and we assume that Hitler wanted to win, but that's not a very intelligent assumption.

Speaker 1:          01:47          Why would you assume that he wasn't exactly a good guy? So why should we assume that he was aiming at the good that he was promoting, even in his own terms, right? The glorious everlasting for Third Reich, right? That a rule for a thousand years and being a bastion of civilization and music because that's the sort of thing he purported to be interested in. Well, so what do you do with the Jews and the Gypsies? Well, round them up, fine in slave and find you. Don't kill them. You certainly don't devote a substantial proportion of your war resources well, you're losing to accelerate the rate at which the extermination is taking place because that's a bit counterproductive unless what you're aiming at is the maximum possible mayhem in the shortest period of time. Well, so what happened as the Germans started to lose the war, did Hitler lose faith in his own ability?

Speaker 1:          02:36          No. He believed that the Germans had to be traded with weakness and so he's perfectly willing to accelerate the rate at which Germany was losing the war and so when Hitler and his minions had the choice, here's the choice. You can suspend your unnecessary demolition of people when the damn war and then pick it up afterwards or while you're losing. You can just accelerate. The may have, even though it's was like, did they pick? Well, they picked to accelerate the mayhem and so to me there's an old psychoanalytic idea. I think this was derived by young. If you can't figure out what someone is doing or why, look at the outcome and infer the motivation. If it produces may him,

Speaker 1:          03:20          perhaps it was aiming at me hip. Now you know, you have to use that dictum carefully. If someone's irritating, you know, maybe it's because you're irritable, had you should sort yourself out, but maybe it's because they're actually aiming at irritating you and that's the actual motivation. So perhaps not, but it's another tool in your analytical armament. So and so you see, well this is the thing about warfare that's so interesting about, about, because you can, you can attribute it to territory, let you can attribute it to a war for resources. That's what the, I would say wretchedly

Speaker 1:          03:58          simple minded economists presume people fight over scarce resources. It's like, hey, we're a little bit more sophisticated than that. And first of all, what resources are you talking about? The bloody anyway, it had nothing. They live perfectly well. What did they have? Snow and seal. Blubber. You know, people can live and unbelievably deprived conditions, and so the idea that there are natural resources that we fight over because there's a shortage of them is a pretty oversimplified view of human beings. It's like, well, why do people fight? Well, maybe they fight sometimes for good reasons, but very, very frequently they fight for bad reasons and those bad reasons are our personal as well as sociocultural and economic. You know, if you were announced a prison guard, for example, whatever pathologies you were carrying around in your destructive little soul, whatever element of Cain was deeply embedded in you had the opportunity to be manifest foley at every moment of your waking existence.

Speaker 1:          04:53          Right? You had these people who were completely beholden to you with no rights whatsoever, to whom you could do whatever you're evil little heart determined think, well, maybe that was a motivation for putting them there to begin with and all the cover story about, well, we're trying to build the Third Reich and we're trying to stabilize the state and we're trying to do all these good things. Maybe that's just a cover story for the real motivation, which is nothing but, but what the construction of death camps that killed 6 million people, how about that and the obliteration of 120 million people on the planet and the and the and the and the leaving of European runes. Maybe that was the motivation or are we going to attribute to Hitler the highest possible motives? Say No, it's an archetype of manifestation of cane. Now he's going to put up a front that says, well, I'm your savior. It's like, well, destructive people think that cane is their savior.
