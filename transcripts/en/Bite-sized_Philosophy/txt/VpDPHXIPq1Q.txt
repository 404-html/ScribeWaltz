Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, the idea of dream analysis I suppose is one of Freud's perhaps Freud's major contribution to modern western thought. The idea was there was something to dreams and I suppose what I did is said, hey, look, isn't it strange we have this whole other form of thought that we engage in at night it and it speaks in the language that we don't really understand and so what the hell is that? And you can say, and many modern people do dreams are of no significance or even that they're random processes, which is an absurd proposition obviously because they're by Terrell, whatever they are, they're obviously not random. So. So Freud's idea was that there was some something in dreams that was informative, so that's his. Now he had a method for describe for extracting out from the dream what the dream purported to represent and he outlined that in great detail in the interpretation of dreams, and if you want to read one book by Freud, I would highly recommend that one.

Speaker 1:          01:01          It's a very long book and it's very detailed, but Freud does it extraordinarily comprehensive analysis of the way that dreams work. Now he made the because because he had brought a theoretical framework to bear, even on his investigation into dream structure, he concluded that dreams were essentially wish fulfillments, and that's where young and Freud disagreed. He also believed that the primary motivating factor of human beings with sexual, and now that's a tougher one to toss aside because even if you're a Darwinian rather than afraid, you're going to obviously support the proposition that sexual motivation among any living creature is going to be one of the highest order motivations because otherwise creatures don't reproduce and and prevail over the long run. So the question is, is that is that the ultimate source of motivation? And in some sense the answer to that has to be yes.

Speaker 1:          01:56          Well, Freud wanted to make that in some ways the sole source of motivation, and I'm over simplifying and I hate to do that in relationship to Freud because he was not as simple minded character young how to dream wants, if I remember correctly, that Freud and you were excavating a basement. And so freud had outlined in Freud had already discovered the basement, let's say. So that would be the unconscious structure of the psyche and young broke through into another basement that was a multi chambered place. So many, many, many rooms and I suppose what drove young and freud apart was young's proposition that there was a hell of a lot more going down, going on down there. Then had already met the eye and they broke on the idea that the sexual impulse was primary, roughly speaking, they broke when you wrote a book called symbols of transformation, which is actually. There's, there's three books that I know of that are sort of like maps of meaning. One is symbols of transformation. One is a book by Eric Norman called the origins and history of consciousness. And the third and the third

Speaker 1:          03:00          one, while his maps of meaning, they're the same book. They're just like, they're trying to solve the same problem from three different directions. They're all attempts to address the same problem. And so symbols of transformation was a book that you wrote about the fantasies of schizophrenia, American woman, and he was. He was trying to relate her fantasies to these old mythological ideas and young's idea essentially. And this is an idea that was shared by people like piaget, so we were not going to say that you and or Freud just pulled this idea out of the air. Was that the, the birthplace of myth, mythology and literature for that matter was the dream that, that they share structural that they share, they sh, they share what mode of information presentation and it's a relatively radical hypothesis, but, but given that they both, they both represent

Speaker 2:          04:06          hmm

Speaker 1:          04:07          dreams, dreams and mythological representations share and essentially narrative structure and they use their literary like, you know, I mean it's not so unreasonable to notice that a dream at night is like the movie that you play in your head and it's not unreasonable to note as well that the dreams that you have at night bear a relationship to the daydreams that you have during the day. It's a form of cognition. It seems like an involuntary form of cognition though. And that's a very strange thing. So young thought about the dream as nature, speaking of its own accord, roughly speaking. And so his idea was, well, when you, when you sleep you dream. But the dream happens to you, it's not something that you create the way that you don't even think about creating it, because I might say, well, what are you thinking about? And you'll say, I'm thinking about whatever it is and you'll take credit in some sense for thinking that because it seems like a voluntary activity, but what happens at night is that you think, but you think in voluntarily, and so what young would say is that means that something is thinking in you

Speaker 1:          05:07          and that's a perfectly reasonable way of looking at it and this is one of the things that's uncanny about the cycle analysts as they they were willing to take their observations to their logical conclusion. There are things that think in you. What are those things and what are they thinking and why are they thinking it? Now, if you do dream analysis, and this is a tricky thing because who's to say if your damn analysis is correct? Right? It's very difficult to understand that. If you. If you do dream analysis with someone, you generally have them lay out their dream and then you ask them when they're going through their dream of second time, they lay out their dream and you can kind of get a picture of it, and then they lay out their dream a second time and as they go through it, every time they mentioned a detail or a character, you ask them what that reminds them of and the is that the dream is presenting an image or an idea that's associated with a network of ideas.

Speaker 1:          06:04          And then if you can expand on the network of ideas as you go through the dream, you can elaborate on the dream. You can expand it upwards and you can start to see what it might be attempting to put forward. Now, Freud's idea was that the dream knew what it was doing, but that its content was being suppressed and oppressed by an internal sensor. So the dream had to be sneaky about what it was saying because it was going to deliver a message that the person didn't want to hear. That that was tied up with his idea of repression, but that's not young's idea. See, young's idea was different. He said, no, no. The dream is trying to tell you what is trying to tell you as clear as it can. That's just the best it can do, and so you could think of the dream, and this is I believe, the right way to think about it.

Speaker 1:          06:50          The dream is the birthplace of thought. The same way that artists are the birthplace of culture. It's exactly the same process. It's that your mind is groping outward to try to comprehend what it has not yet comprehended and it does that first by trying to map it onto image and it's doing that in the dream and it's somewhat incoherent and and, and well, let's stick within coherent because it's not yet a full fledged thought. It's the birthplace of thought. It's a fantasy about what might be, and then if you can grip the fantasy and share it with other people, then maybe they can elaborate upon it and bring it into being with more clarity than it would be if it merely existed as the precursor of a thought in your imagination.
