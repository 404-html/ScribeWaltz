Speaker 1:          00:01          They don't have to believe it. That's pure narcissism at work, by the way, you don't want to hijack hijacking event like this and other people put time and effort into and to use the civility of the crowd and the civility of the organizers as an excuse to blatantly yellow. You're ill informed opinions is no way to conduct a civil dialogue. It's absolutely appalling. The people who do that should be embarrassed.

Speaker 2:          01:47          Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:58          Yes. I would also say that as students and as faculty members, you shouldn't put up with it. There is no way that you should allow people who are doing this to hijack your educational opportunities and to bend and twist the functions and the structures of the university. It's not a good thing. Not In any way at all. I would say that was a very disgraceful display fundamentally, so let's stick with it. Why? Why do you think people are afraid of free speech? Well, you know, people develop an ideological view of the world because they don't want to think through things in real detail and they're aided and embedded in that endeavor by their pathological professors who are feeding them. What would I say? Oversimplified an oversimplified radical view of the world, in my estimation, is fundamentally based in, in resentment. Not that there's no reason for say, a left wing view of the world and we can get to that later.

Speaker 1:          02:57          It's easy virtue. You know, you can stand up in front of 900 people with your art and your and your screeching and you can. You can declaim to the entire audience your fundamental moral superiority. You can tell everyone at once that they're all beneath you and you're standing for the right thing and absolutely none of that is earned. You know, like, what the hell? What the hell was that? There's, it's come seriously man. There's just, it's just complete misbehavior. It's embarrassing and the fact that the people who do that don't have enough sense to go hide their head in shame just tells you how badly socialize they are and how terribly educated they are. And the thing is, the thing that's so awful is that there are professors and educators who promote that and say, well, that's how you change the world. It's like it is how you change the world, but it's certainly not how you make it better.

Speaker 1:          03:43          You make it worse. Clearly, you know, there is no comfort in that and there's nothing about it. Impressive. It's no, it's no better in some sense than a two year old having a tantrum on the floor. It shows, as far as I'm concerned, it approximately the same level of psychosocial development. So when the fact that this is happening continually, universities is, it's, it truly makes me embarrassed to be associated with the university. And now I say that with great displeasure because, you know, I've been working for great universities for a very long time and the university is an absolutely remarkable institution. You know, it's survived for a thousand years and, and to see it, to see it brought down by by people whose behavior would be out of place at a four year old's birthday party is is something something bizible to behold.
