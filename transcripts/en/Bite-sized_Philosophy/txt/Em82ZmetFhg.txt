Speaker 1:          00:00          One of the things that's quite interesting about the gulag camps, and this is something that's very relevant to understanding of modern Russia, is that so ordinary criminals were put into the camps and so were political prisoners, prisoners, but the ordinary criminals, and so those would be rapists and murderers, let's say, as well as thieves who were engaged in theft as an occupation. Those were regarded by the Soviets as socially friendly elements, and the reason for that was that they assume that the reason that these people had turned to crime was because the approach of the oppressive nature of the previous czarist slash capitalist system and that the only reason that these criminals existed was because they had been oppressed. They were oppressed victims of that system. And so one of the convenient consequences of that absolutely insane doctrine was that the Soviets put the ordinary criminals in charge of the camps and these were very, very seriously bad people.

Speaker 1:          00:53          And so you could imagine the way that they treated the political prisoners who were regarded as socially hostile elements. Sometimes because of their own hypothetically traitorous acts, but more often merely as a consequence of their racial or ethnic identity or the fact that they were related by birth to say people who had been successful under the previous system, so who had any, any association with nobility or any association with what were known as the Kulaks who were the only successful class of former peasants in the Soviet Union because they were regarded as privileged. You may have heard that word more recently. They were regarded as privileged and therefore as enemies of the state, and it didn't matter if it was your father or your grandfather or your great grandfather who happened to be privileged, but the mere fact that you were a member of that group was sufficient reason to put you into a camp.

Speaker 1:          01:44          And we're talking hundreds of thousands or perhaps millions of people who underwent that fate. And so the idea and the Soviet Union was just because you were the member of a class. Even as a consequence of your familial association. You were immediately sufficiently guilty to be put into a camp and punished. And the. And the terms for the camps were often 10 years, 15 years long, and if you were very fortunate, you got to have two or three of those. So the Soviets really instant implemented and, and perfected the idea of class and if this is based guilt and it's a very bad road to walk down and it's something that we're very much engaged in at the moment because there's discussion everywhere in North America now about the idea of while race predicated guilt for example, and ethnic predicated guilt and some very bad idea to classify an entire group of people as guilty of anything based on their group membership. So these, these sorts of things are things we haven't yet learned and certainly should have.
