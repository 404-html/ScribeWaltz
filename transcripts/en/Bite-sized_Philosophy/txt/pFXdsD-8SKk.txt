Speaker 1:          00:00          I read it, wrote, read a very interesting book awhile back called the wealth and poverty of nations that was written by a Harvard emeritus professor of history and one of the things that he claimed I liked it. I thought it was very smart, was that the only true natural resources, interpersonal trust. If you can set up a society where people trust each other, then it will instantly become rich. And he used the example of Japan, which is a very conscientious society and very rich society, but the Japanese have no natural resources, right? None to speak of and yet the rich and then you have countries like the Soviet Russia and much of South America where there's just natural resources, but you know, they're just like Venezuela. Just more natural resources. Then you know what to do with and the places are absolute catastrophes. My absolute catastrophes of cynicism and corruption.

Speaker 1:          00:48          And so he attempted to document the relationship between default interpersonal trust among citizens within countries and their, their productivity in their, their GDP and their standard of living and found a very, very tight relationship. And, and I liked that a lot and I've got a story about that quickly that I think is very interesting. I'll tell you two stories. One sort of generic, I'll tell you one personal first. So one day I lend my car to one of my graduate students and he took it to Montreal, is this old Cadillac and he got it was a really bad rainstorm in Montreal and he was in one of the highways that are like set into the ground and it was like six inches of water and he was turning a corner, hit the brakes and skidded on the water and smacked it into the wall and on the corner of the, of the bumper, you know.

Speaker 1:          01:37          And so then he brought it back and he was very apologetic about it. And, and uh, his name was matt shade tell you that because Matt might hear this and I can shame them and bit for doing this 20 years ago, you know, and uh, he's a professor at the Ontario Institute of Technology I think now and quite a successful one. But anyways, he brought the car back and I went and got it evaluated for damages, it was like $1,700 or something to repair it and, or maybe more, but it was almost as much as the car was worth. And I thought, well I'm not gonna do that. So I went online and I typed in the part and uh, if you do that you can get people to bid on sending you used part from all over North America. So that's Kinda cool. So there's all these junk dealers have got together and they have this network of communication.

Speaker 1:          02:24          So you put in the car part and then they send you a bit. And so this guy said, well, I'll send you that bumper assembly, which is the whole bumper and the lights for like 250 bucks. And I thought, yeah, okay, you could do that, that'd be good. So then I said yes. And then he called me up about half an hour later if this guy from way down south, he had a really deep sort of Mississippi accent and he said, wait a sec, was that for the bumper or the bumper assembly? And I said, well, it was for the bumper assembly. He said, oh, I thought it was for the bumper. And then he said, but that's okay. I'll send it to you anyways. And I thought, well that's pretty good. So said, well thank you. And then I hung up and then half an hour later he called me up again and he said, look, I just went out and looked at that bumper assembly and there's a plastic trim piece on the side and it has a scratch in it.

Speaker 1:          03:09          And I thought, I better tell you that just in case you didn't want it. And I thought, wow, that's so amazing. It's like there's a miracle man. It's like this guy, he's somewhere in Mississippi. I'm never going to see him again. Ever. Never gonna have any contact with them. Like he made a bad deal. Right? Because the part was worth more than he decided to sell it to me for, but he stuck with this deal and then he went over and above the call of duty. He said, well, this part that I'm selling you to you for way less than it's worth is damaged. So I thought I'd better tell you. It's like, man, you got to recognize a miracle when you see one that was a miracle. So I said, hey look, it's thanks for calling man. So okay, I can handle the scratch.

Speaker 1:          03:48          Send the part. And he did and I got the car fixed and forgave Matt and you know, it had a happy ending. So. So that's trust, right? Because I didn't know him from Adam and he's a primate full of snakes just like the rest of us. And yet he was willing to simplify himself to the point where I could just take him absolutely at his word. And that meant we could trade even though we were strangers. It's like, man, do not underestimate the utility of that. And then there's Ebay. When Ebay first started, you know the idea was not gonna work because you'll send me junk and all send you a check that bounces and that'll be the end of Ebay, right, and so these escrow agents popped up so you could insure your transaction with them moves for like 10 percent of the transaction.

Speaker 1:          04:30          They would get the check and the goods and make sure that they were okay and then send them on or ensure the transaction, but what happened was the escrow agents didn't make any money and the reason for that was no one cheated. You think about how amazing that is, right? You bring these people together across a whole continent. They've never seen each other before. They're never going to interact with each other again, and this was before there were any reputation ratings on Ebay, and yet the default transaction was you describe your goods honestly, including their flaws. You set a reasonable price. I decided to pay you. You ship the goods and I pay you, and it works. And what happened was that Ebay produced, it produced a tremendous amount of capital that was previously frozen, so frozen capitalist. When you've invested money in something but the thing is no longer useful to you, so the money is just sitting there frozen, right, so to speak, and you can't get it loose because, well, you've got an attic full of junk. How are you gonna? Get rid of that. Oh, E bay. And so all of a sudden all these things that were just junk became valuable and everybody got richer and none of that wouldn't. It would have happened without the covenant that we established between each other that's predicated on trust. And so you might say that trust is the currency and currency is trust because it's a promissory note, right? And if people lie, then the currency gets debased very, very rapidly. And so the economy runs on trust.
