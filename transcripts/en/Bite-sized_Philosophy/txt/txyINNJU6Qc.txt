Speaker 1:          00:01          Couple of questions about dialogue and engaging in dialogue with people. So the first issue that I faced is a, I have a very high need for intellectual stimulation and I can't get that with most people. It's something like you can, you can have a dialogue for a time, but then it

Speaker 2:          00:20          titrate openness

Speaker 1:          00:22          and, and that. But then they started running out of ideas they can keep up and it sort of falls apart and okay, this is a problem that intellectuals have quite frequently is that they, they sort of, once they started getting difficult and rewarding stuff, they stop wanting to talk to regular people and I think that contributes to the disconnect that you see between the intellectuals and working class people and stuff like that. And the other question I had was about,

Speaker 2:          00:49          okay, wait, I don't know if that's the question. I believe there's a question in there.

Speaker 1:          00:54          The question is how, how do you, how should we address that? How should I address it? And uh, is that something that can be dressed?

Speaker 2:          01:01          Well, part of, part of the answer to that is that's what the universities were for. I mean, you know, not everybody is equipped to or interested in engaging in high level discussion of abstract and creative ideas. You know, you hear this idea that everyone's creative. That's a lie. It's a straightforward, is that true? Creativity is very, very rare and so, and if you happen to be a creative person or if you happen to be someone who's profoundly interested in ideas, you are in a pronounced minority just as you are, if you happen to be extremely extroverted or extremely agreeable, are extremely conscientious. These are minority issues and what you do is you find likeminded people who are capable of engaging that we know a heavyweight heavyweight weightlifters compete with heavyweight weightlifters for a reason and everyone thinks that's fine and the same thing applies to intellectual and creative endeavors.

Speaker 2:          01:54          So what you do is you try to find a community where that's, that's the nature of the community and you likely have to find a relationship like that as well. So I don't think so. I think what contributes to the siloing is the arrogance that goes along with it. Because if you're, you can be interested in ideas and you can be creative. Well that's the arrogance of the intellect, right? That's the thing the Catholic Church had warned about for centuries is the arrogance of the intellect. So because if you're, if you're wise as well as smart and there is no relationship between being smart and being wise, they are not the same thing. There is no quick pathway from smart to wise. And many of the people who I've known who were very wise were, some of them were intellectually impaired and we're still wise, you know, so it's the arrogance that brings up the block.

Speaker 2:          02:46          And I see this, for example, happening in the United States in particular because the last time I went down there, for example, I was, I had friends down there and some of those friends are very, very smart people and some of them were talking about the voters and they were talking about the trump voters with contempt and I thought you better watch that because that's 50 percent of the dam population and it might be convenient to think that they're stupid and beneath you, but it's not conducive to a civil state and there's no evidence that it's true because there isn't a straight line between intelligent and wise. And so I think that if your, if your character is developed and you're intelligent, you can have your siloed, creative community, but you develop enough wisdom so that you can see all the things that people can do that or have high ethical utility that are outside the intellectual domain.

Speaker 2:          03:39          You know? And I think that's why in the New Testament, I think that's why Christ is a carpenter, right? Because, well, first of all, carpenter is one of those jobs that when you're dishonest, it manifests itself immediately because what you build falls down, and so if you're an honest carpenter, you build a good house. So there's a nice metaphor there, but it's also. It's also a warning in some sense against the the equation of intellectual brilliance with moral superiority. And so if the intellects would drop their moral superiority and fat chance there is of that, then that divide between the working class say and the elite would would resolve. And there's every reason to have respect for decent working class people. I mean it's on their labor as the left wingers at least hypothetically agree that the entire edifice of the culture is, is resting so you can have your cake and eat it too.

Speaker 2:          04:44          But you have to not assume that your niche makes you superior. And it's very difficult for smart people, especially smart. There's this scene in niches. Sins thus spake Zarathustra were zero. Booster of the profit comes down from the mountain and he comes into a public square and there's this crowd around this little midget who is only about this high, who has a gigantic ear and everyone is marveling at him. Well, that's what the modern intellect is like. It's a midget with a giant. Well mouth generally not an ear and the the, the being is underdeveloped, but the intellect is hyper activated and it makes the person extraordinarily unbalanced and it's partly because a, they can't compete outside of the intellectual realm and that makes them very bitter because they tend to think, well, God, I'm so smart. Everything should just come to me. It's like, sorry, that's not how the world works. And, and it also that, that and that, that, that attitude is immediately evident to people that they're talking to when they talk in the manner that they talk, if they are arrogant intellectuals of that sort. You see that in the simpsons did a good job of that with Comic Book Guy, right? I mean, he completely useless in every possible dimension with an Iq of about 160 and it's very annoying to people who have an Iq of 160 that they can also be completely useless, but it happens a lot. So yeah.
