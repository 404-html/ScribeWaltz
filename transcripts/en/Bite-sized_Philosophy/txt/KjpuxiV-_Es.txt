Speaker 1:          00:01          Life is suffering, right? Indisputable.

Speaker 1:          00:07          What do you do about that? You, you voluntarily accepted and then strive to overcome the suffering. That's a consequence of that and you do that for you and you do that in a way that makes it better for other people and then that works and one question might be, well, how well does it work? And the answer is you're. The only way that you can find out is by trying it. That's it. That's the existential element of it. The proof is to be derived by the incarnation of the attitude in your own life. No one can tell you how it will work for you. It's the thing that your destiny is to discover that and you have to make. You have to make the decisions to begin with. It's like because you can't do this without commitment, you have to commit to it first. That's the act of faith that the character guard was so insistent upon.

Speaker 1:          01:02          You have to say, I'm going to act as if being as good. I'm going to act as if truth is the pathway to enlightenment. I'm going to act as if I should pursue the deepest meaning possible in my life, and there's there's reasons to do none of those, their real reasons, so it's really a decision, but you can't find out what the consequences of the decision is unless you make the decision. I think the same thing happens when you get married. By the way, if you think you might leave, you're not married and then you think, well, the marriage didn't succeed. It's like, well, maybe you were never married because the rule is you don't get to leave and there's a reason for that rule. Now I'm not saying that there aren't situations where there should be exceptions made for that. That's not the point. The point is that there's some games you don't get to play unless you're all in, and the other thing that's so interesting about being alive is that you're all in. No matter what you do, you're all in. This is going to kill you. So I think you might as well play the most magnificent game you can while you're waiting, because do you have anything better to do? Really? Why not? Pick the best thing possible that you could do.

Speaker 1:          02:15          Why not do that? Maybe you could justify you're wretched existence to yourself that way I think you could. That's what it looks like. You know, people find such meaning in the responsibilities they adopted, stops making them ask questions about what life is for. If you have a newborn child, for example, like unless you're really in a bad way, psychotically depressed or or maybe your personality really needs some retooling, you stop thinking about

Speaker 1:          02:43          anything but ensuring that that baby is doing well and if someone comes along and asks you an existential question about your commitment to that, the right response is why are you asking me such stupid questions when, when the, when this, this is manifesting itself right in front of your eyes like how blind can you be? That isn't a time for, for questions about the meaning of life. The answer is right in front of you and if you can't see it, it's not because life has no meaning. It's because you're blind mean. That's what they image of the Virgin mother and the child is all about. It's like, what's the answer to the meaning of life? Here's an answer. It's like, well, I'm going to criticize that. Well, go right ahead. You know? It's like. It's like what? What? You're. You're like a, you're like a, what do you call that? A termite. Knowing on a temple, there's no, there's no utility and that sort of criticism. It's blindness and it's the same thing with regards to the path of the hero. It's like it glistens in front of you and you can criticize it. It's like,

Speaker 2:          03:50          fine.

Speaker 1:          03:52          Put the cart before the horse and see how far you get. So I thought to bring full closure to the class, I was trying to solve this terrible puzzle that confronted me for and many other people about how it was that human beings got themselves in such a tangle about what they believed, such a tangle that we were pointing the ultimate weapons of destruction at one another. Which by the way, we are still doing.

Speaker 1:          04:24          I thought, okay, well I understand that we need their belief systems. They orient us and that means there will be conflict between belief systems and that can be a catastrophe and that's being played out everywhere. Again, in very many ways. What's the solution to that? Well, one possibility is there is no solution. It's just mayhem all the way around could be the case, but it seemed to me as I delved into it that the proper solution to that was to live properly as an individual because you're more powerful than you think way more powerful than you think. I mean God only knows what you are in the final analysis. You're blind to your own weaknesses, but you're also blind to your own strengths and so then I think, well, if you got your act together, it'd be better for you and instantly it would be better for your family. Assuming they wanted you to get your act together and not everyone does, but. And then it would be better for the community. It's like how far can you take that if you stopped wasting time and if you start lying and if you oriented yourself to the highest possible good that you could conceive of and you committed to that, how much good could you do? Well, I would say money. Find out.

Speaker 1:          05:37          So that's what I think you should do. You should find out you don't have anything better to do and there was nothing in it as far as I've been able to tell. There's nothing in it but good.

Speaker 2:          05:49          So

Speaker 1:          05:51          maybe you could sort yourself out so that you wanted nothing but the good and and then maybe you could help make that manifest in the world and maybe we wouldn't have all these terrible problems. Then at least we'd have fewer of them and that would be a start. So it's the, it's the, the answer to the problem of humanity is the, is the, is the integrity of the individual. That's the answer. So and states that are predicated on that realization are healthy. So in states that aren't, are doomed to stagnation and catastrophic collapse and personalities that are predicated on self tyranny. And the tyranny of others are doomed and doomed to collapse. So and then you think, well, what's the barrier? The barriers are you willing to accept the responsibility and part of the answer to that is reduced the damn responsibility until it's tolerable. You don't have to have to fix everything at once. You could just start by fixing the things that you could fix or you could even do it more. You can do it with even less self sacrifice. You could start by fixing only the things that you want to fix. God, you can get a massive way that way. So do it. See what happens. That's what you should have been taught in university right from the beginning. It's like aim at the highest good tool yourself into something that can attain it and go out there and manifested in the world and everything. That everything that comes your way will be

Speaker 1:          07:34          everything that comes your way will be a blessing. And so, oh, you have to do is give up your resentment and your hatred. I know that's a hard thing to give up because he had plenty of reason for it. That's probably a good place to stop console.

Speaker 2:          07:52          It was a pleasure.
