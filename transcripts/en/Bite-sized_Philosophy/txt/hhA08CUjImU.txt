Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay, so your association task, the principle is this word association game. It's actually predicated, I would say on psychoanalytic ideas, most particularly on union ideas because young development association tests many, many, many years ago, but it purports to investigate whether you are unconsciously bias towards one group against another group. Could be gender, could be ethnicity, could be race, could be attractiveness, whatever. But the problem is is that when you give the same person that damn it twice, they don't get the same results. So there's a rule for diagnostic tasks and the rule is the reliability test, retest reliability has to exceed something like point eight or point nine, point eight at least. So the big five does that. Iq tests do that, but there's a dam a, there's damn few tasks that passed that reliability criteria and the it is the only reliable, I don't remember precisely, but I think it's about point five, which isn't even, it's not even near close enough to be used as a diagnostic test.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Plus it's not valid. So what does that mean? Well, let's say I assess your unconscious bias and give you a diagnosis. Well, there's no evidence that it predicts your behavior, so. So what? What good is it? What good is it? Well, it's good if you want people to send you to retraining exercises so that you can have your perceptions adjusted in the direction that your organization in the state thinks is proper and that's happening everywhere. I got letters this week already for people at CBC. It's becoming mandatory there at St Mike's Hospital, same thing and they've decided that all of their micro institutions within the hospital will be equitable. There'll be 50 percent women and 50 percent men at every single level of the organization or the organization is corrupt and oppressive. It's like it's that. It's spreading so fast you can't believe that. I wrote Mazur Anthony Greenwald yesterday.

Speaker 1:          01:54          I hadn't set it off to some of my colleagues say, are you going to come out and make a public statement about the fact that your damn test is being used by pathological people for nefarious purposes? It's like, well, we'll see what they have to say about that. I was a bit more polite in my letters, but there's no excuse for it. There's absolutely no excuse for it and as far as I'm concerned, it's part of the broader corruption of social psychology. You guys may know or may not. The social psychology has been rife with with controversy and scandal over the last three or four years and a big part of the reason for that is it's damn corrupt. Discipline and that use of the iat for political reasons is a perfect example of that. There is no excuse for it and the people at St Mike's, you know, they say, well, this is scientifically validated.

Speaker 1:          02:40          It's like, no, it's not and worse. Let's say you do have unconscious bias just for the sake of argument and you could measure it reliably, which you can't, and then it was valid, which it isn't. Let's say all of those things were in case there's no evidence whatsoever that those damn on unconscious bias training programs, retraining programs have the effect that they're supposed to have and there's some evidence that they actually have the reverse effect and maybe that's because people don't really like being marched off to reeducation by their employers after they've been diagnosed as racist. Even if there's no evidence that they in fact are so, it's an absolute misuse of psychology and it's politically motivated. It's politically motivated. It's an assault on freedom. Anyways, I made those two videos and I took, tried to take the HR and equity people at uft to task because they made that training mandatory for their hr people.

Speaker 1:          03:33          I thought, you don't have the right as an employer to invade the unconscious structures of your employee's minds and alter their political perspective. Even though you can't do it. You don't have the right to do that and to think about it as something you should do. As a matter of course, as part of your ethical duty is you really want that. You really want that. That's what you want your employers to be able to do. Figure out independently of your behavior whether or not you're a racist or classist or or a misogynist or whatever that happens to be and you really think that the bureaucrats at the university, for example, or bureaucrats anywhere for that matter are actually capable and qualified of doing such a thing properly. It doing far more damage than than any possible. Good.
