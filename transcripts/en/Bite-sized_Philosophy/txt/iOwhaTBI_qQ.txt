Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:00          and why? Behold is the moat that isn't my brother's eye, but consider us not the beam that is in or how will you say to that? My brother, let me pull out the motive of the NIH and behold, a beam is in nine Onei. What you might be wondering, what a beam is. A moat is the dust speck

Speaker 2:          00:19          and a beam is a very large piece of lumber and so the issue is not so much the blindness of others even though there's as much blindness among others as there is in as there is for you, but the issue here, the advice here, the description here is you should be concerned about what's interfering with your own vision first and you should leave other people the hell alone in relationship to that, and so if you're a mode of being in the world is if you would just act better, things would improve for me. Or if you identify the evil and the catastrophe is something that's outside that someone else needs to fix, or that someone's responded someone else's responsible for, then then you're not going to fix that and you're going to remain blind to the things that you're doing and not doing that make things not go well and so it's just better to think, all right, I'm probably blind in many, many ways and maybe there are some ways that I could rectify that because it's highly probable that you're blind and all sorts of ways. I mean, it's. It's in fact it's virtually certain and so it's just more useful to think,

Speaker 2:          01:40          how is it that I'm wrong in this situation? I'll tell you something that I learned to do when I was arguing with my wife, which happened quite frequently. Because when you actually communicate with people, you find out that there's many things that you don't agree on and that's because you were actually different creatures. And so if you're actually going to have a truthful conversation, then you're going to find out that you don't see things the same way. And then you can either pretend that that's not the case in gloss over it and then ended up in a 30 year silent war or you can or you can have the damn fight when you need to have it and see if you can straighten it out. So now and then we'd get in a situation where we were at loggerheads, we couldn't move and it would spiral up into hate speech, let's say, because yeah, everyone laughs because they know they manifest plenty of hate speech towards those they love. So one of the things we learned to do was when we hit an impasse was to separate and to go our own ways and to go sit and think, okay, look, we're at this

Speaker 2:          02:47          unpleasant situation. We can't figure out how to move forward. I'd always think, of course it's her fault. Obviously it's her fault. Least Ninety five percent. But maybe there was something I did that contributed like five percent to it. And so I would sit and think and ask myself a question, which was, is there anything that I did in the last six months that increase the probability that this impasse would manifest itself? And I'll tell you, you have no idea how fast your mind will generate an answer to a question like that because there's undoubtedly some idiotic thing that you did that you know that you remember that increased the probability that you're going to have your hands around the throat of the person that you love. And then you can go tell them that and then you can have a conversation, especially if they do the same thing. Say, look, you know, here's how I'm an idiot in this situation. Now there person says, well, yeah, it's, here's how I'm an idiot, and then your two idiots, and then maybe you can have a conversation. So thou hypocrite first cast out the beam of light, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote of thy brother's eye. That's pay hard to argue with that.
