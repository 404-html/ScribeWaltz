Speaker 1:          00:00          So here's a cool psychological study, so it's called the marshmallow test and maybe it's even a reliable study. Even though it was done by social psychologists, it's probably replicable and it's a nice study. So you take small children and you bring them into a room and you put something that they would like in front of them, a marshmallow and you then you torture them. Basically you say, see that marshmallow in the kid thinks, man, I see that marshmallow. It's like you can have that marshmallow right now or if you wait, I think the experiment is 10 minutes. Then you can have two marshmallows. And so that puts the child in quite a conundrum because they're being asked to trade in actual concrete, tangible marshmallow for two hypothetical future marshmallows and it's not that easy to conjure up a hypothetical future reality that has the same tangible significance as something real right in front of you.

Speaker 1:          01:05          And so it's amazing thing that people can do that. And so then the experimenter leaves and some children's grabbed the marshmallow and just chomp that thing down right now. Other kids, they videotaped kids while they're waiting and they do all sorts of things. They whistled, they look at the ceiling, they sit on their hands, you know, they tried to distract themselves. Course they're eyeing that marshmallow like a squirrel lying and not and and trying to restrain themselves and you know what I see in that is that the child's prefrontal Cortex, the higher cortical systems are warring with the underlying motivational systems, more primordial motivational systems that govern such things as hunger. The hunger system, hypothalamic system says there's something sweet and fat right? Sitting there, right bloody now grab that thing and stuff it down now, and I'm sure many of you have a constant battle with your hypothalamus with regards to sweet and fat things and often lose so you can feel some sympathy for the child, but the hypothalamus has these tremendously powerful tendrils upward into the brain, into the parts that we would associate more with voluntary control and the voluntary control centers have these little weak ribbons going down to control the hypothalamus.

Speaker 1:          02:24          Since it's pretty obvious, if you know something about neuroanatomy, what part is actually in charge when the chips are down, and it's not easy for children to learn to regulate those underlying primordial impulses, the ones that are wired in, the ones that we share with animals, but they do it and and, and the cool thing is, this is what Walter Michelle found. He's the guy who did the study, was that the longterm outcome for the children who can delay gratification in the marshmallow test is much more positive than it is for the children that are impulsive and eat the marshmallow instantly. It's delay of gratification. Now it's likely that that's associated with trait conscientiousness, although that specifically has that specific connection has not yet been established, but they seem conceptually very, very similar. So. So anyways, this emerges in children probably between the ages of two and four, something like that.

Speaker 1:          03:24          They should have it in place by four because it's very difficult for them to really interact well with other children without having that delay of gratification in place. Because if you can't delay gratification, other kids don't like you because you're. You want everything your way and you want it now and you're. You're liable to temper tantrums and that sort of thing. You haven't got the kind of self control necessary to make you fun to play with so you can see that emerging in children and it's pretty. It's pretty interesting and not only that, if it emerges, it predicts positive longterm outcomes just like trait conscientiousness does by the way, because trait conscientiousness is the second best predictor of longterm success over the lifespan. In Western cultures, it's second after intelligence and so in our societies, the people who do best across time are the people who have high Iq is and who work hard and I would say that's a pretty decent, what would you call it? It's a validation in some sense that our cultures are working properly because what you would want, I would say if the system is working meritocratic Lee like it should, and if you're trying to extract resources from those who can contribute at a higher rate than what you would want to have happen is that the hard working smart people do better. Hopefully. If that's the case, then everyone does better. Hopefully.
