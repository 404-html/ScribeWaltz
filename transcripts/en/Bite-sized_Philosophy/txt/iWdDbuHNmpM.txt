Speaker 1:          00:00          The thing is, whenever I look at a political movement, especially ideological, I think, okay, there's a bunch of things your for fine, what are you against? You know, because one of the things that people who adopted need theological position, like to presume is that all of the right is on their site and that makes them very unconscious up their shadow. Let's say from a union perspective. The Nazis had all sorts of positive reasons for what they were doing,

Speaker 1:          00:29          but you know, the negative reasons were there too and you could easily make it a case that the negative reasons were really the reasons. And when I look at video logs, I always think, yeah, yeah, that's what you're for sure, but I don't believe all the good people are on your site and be. I know that negative motivations are more powerful than positive ones. So you say you're for things, but you're against them too. So let's, let's start with that. So I thought I started thinking about this after I read George Orwell. I love George Orwell, by the way. How many of you know who George Orwell is? Wow. Really? That's impressive. How many don't. Okay, well that's, that's good. That's amazing. How the hell did you learn about George Orwell's? Nineteen 84. Fundamentally, or animal farm? Animal Farm. Okay. Okay. Well that's good because George Orwell, man, I tell you, George Orwell was the first western intellectual who figured out what the hell was going on in the Soviet Union.

Speaker 1:          01:24          And he did that in the mid forties, early. You know what was complicated because we sort of knew what was happening in the twenties and the thirties, you know, there was lennon and that wasn't so good. There was the Russian civil war, there was the idea of universal communism that wasn't such a good idea, you know, for, as far as people who didn't want to be communists were concerned. And then there was what happened in the Ukraine in the 1930. So it was like, you know, the evidence was starting to pile up. But unfortunately what happened was the Spanish civil war and the lefties were pretty much the good guys in the Spanish civil war. Right. It was like a microcosm of the Second World War. The lefties were fighting the fascists and some of the lefties were communists, but a lot of them were also people who were, I think genuinely fighting for freedom and a lot of North American literary figures went to Spain to fight on the side of the.

Speaker 1:          02:15          No, you know, against the fascists. And so fair enough, you know, the fascist were obviously, you know, reprehensible clearly and so and so that kind of muddied the water right because the fastest were bad. And then that sort of means that people that are fighting them, their garden and some of them are communists and there was good. There was pretty good reason for people to be radical socialist at that point in human history because the plight of the working man was relatively unpleasant. George Orwell wrote a book called road to Wigan Pier and he went up to this town that was a coal mining town and he, he stayed with the coal miners for awhile and just looked at their life. So here, here's a part of their life.

Speaker 1:          02:58          So you work at seven and a half hour shift when you're a coal miner and you think, oh, that's not too bad by 1930 standards. It's like, yeah, except you have to go down to the coal mine tunnels, you know, and like they're not eight feet high and carpeted there like four and a half feet high and rough and poorly lit and the ers terrible. And so basically you have to chimp walk or crawl up to three miles just to get to work and then you have to do that at the end of your shift and you don't get paid for that. That's just, that's your commute, right? Right. So you know, it was no bloody well. And then of course what you're doing when you get there, it's like it's absolutely filthy. It's unbelievably noisy. It's brutally difficult. He said the coal miners, they have no teeth because they're like, because of their living conditions, but their bodies were absolutely perfect.

Speaker 1:          03:52          They were unbelievably powerful and strong because all they did was incredibly intense physical labor, but it was bloody rough. And the housing, those people had like 50 families for one outhouse, that's probably good enough to describe it. And often they were row houses and the row houses had no back doors that may add no pass between them. And all the old houses were at the back. So that meant if you were was like 20 below and it was the winter and you were sick, then you get to go all the way around the block to your damn. I will tell us where maybe there's only one there and you line up with 50 people so that. Yeah. So in order while he was orwell was an upper class guy basically, and he was trying to help themselves overcome these upperclass prejudices who is a real documentary, one of the terrible working conditions of, of, of working class people.

Speaker 1:          04:43          And he wrote this book called Road to Wigan Pier. But one of the things that or will said, he wrote this story about these poor God damn coal miners and you think, well yeah, it's like how about some social legislation so that these people and their children aren't just absolutely brutalized nonstop. You know. But then he wrote the last half of the book and he wrote it for the left book club, which was a socialist group that we publish a book every month or so. And what he did was he. He wrote a critique of socialism of pretty socialism and he said, yeah, well this sucks man. It's like we should be on the. Sorry to these working people, but the social assigned meet, they're not on the side of the working people. They're like tweed wearing middle class hyper intellectuals who never go anywhere near the working class because of their class. Prejudice isn't for all sorts of other reasons and they don't like the poor at all.

Speaker 1:          05:32          They just hate the rich. And I thought I had been a member of the NDP for a long time. At that point. It was always something a little off about it. Especially the more radical kind that's with you guys is it doesn't look like benevolence as far as I can tell. There's a lot of whining and complaining and resentment. It's like, what's that? What's that about? I read Orwell and I thought, right, if you hate the successful, if you hate the rich, who are rich by the way is whoever has more money than you. Right? That's how you define rich and the best way to mask your resentment, just to pretend that you're on the side of the poor. And I read that. I thought that's exactly right. And then that's part of also what made me psychoanalytically oriented because one thing psychoanalysts always do always is if you say you're, here's how I'm positively predisposed.

Speaker 1:          06:25          The psychoanalyst says, how are you using that to mask something easy and malevolent that you're doing? And that's always. That's a very, very useful questions. Not always correct, right? But, but it's correct a lot more than people generally like to think, you know, it's like the mothering him grant the mother or the witch in Hansel and Gretel. You know the story, right? This guy gets married, he's got a couple of kids. His new wife doesn't relate to the kids. You have 100 times higher chance by the way of being abused by a step parent than the biological parent. Just so you know, so the step where they're just like the kids, she tells the guy, well, why don't you just go with those kids out in the woods, sold out. They go out in the woods. So they're lost kids, right? They have nowhere to go.

Speaker 1:          07:13          So when they're wandering around out there in the forest, what happens? They come across a gingerbread house. You think, wow man, you're a starving kid. Just your bread house. That's good news, right? Not only is it a house, but it's made out of candy. How could anything possibly be any better? So when they go, well, and then there's this grandmother type type and you know, she's starts to fatten them up and she puts, I think it's handling the cage and she gets settled after a while to basically work as their scullery maid and equip becomes quite obvious to the children that she's actually fattening them up so that she can put them in the oven and eat them. And so I think what Hansel does is I think gretel gives him this leg bone from some animal and the old, which half blind and every time she reaches into sort feel is laying, he gives her the bone and so like she's just not all that interested in meeting them in anyways. The kids ended up pushing her in the oven and closing it and getting the hell out of there. So you know, it's a happy ending as far as fairy tales school. But it's an atypical story, right? It's a classic story, but it needed whole family. Be bloody wary of people who do too much for you. Right? It's like if you have a mother or any other relatives for that matter,

Speaker 1:          08:30          who's fattening you up on mercy and candy, the probability that her basic goal is to eat you enough so that you never leave. The probability is extraordinarily high and that's no joke. You know, one of the things that you do learn if you read about the sorts of people who burst out of their mother's basement and go shoot up Dawson colleges that often. That's exactly the situation that you've been, right. They're burning with resentment in their uselessness down in the basement for five or six years, you know, they don't have to leave, they don't have to become independent, everything's done for them. So they never have to do anything for themselves. It's like it's not pretty. And so one of the rules for dealing with people, and I know this is actually a rule for dealing with elderly people in, in, in, in, in hopes for, for, for retired people, is do not do anything for anyone they can do for themselves.

Speaker 1:          09:23          You are stealing from them when you do that. And it's a great rule of thumb for kits. Like once they can dress themselves, they dress themselves. If they can set the table, even if it takes 20 minutes, it's like they're setting the table. You're not doing them a favor by helping them do anything they can do themselves and it gets Kinda, it's Kinda harsh, you know, but it beats the hell out of the witch in Hansel and Gretel. So. So anyways, one of the things we're going to look at as well as the dark side of positive motivations.
