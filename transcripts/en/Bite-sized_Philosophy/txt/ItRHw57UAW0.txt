Speaker 1:          00:00          And you know, you go into places like that, I always think of the archetypal diner in that way. You know, you guys have been in this diner, there's a really good opposite diner and there's a great video on youtube. It's Tom waits reading, reading a poem by Makowsky and I think it's called Nirvana. And it's about a good diner that, that happened to visit because he happened to visit when he was on a bus when he was a, when he was a kid, a diner where everything was going well. And you could listen to that. It's great. I think it's great. But this is the opposite diner I'm thinking about. So you'll go into a diner, right? It's 7:00 in the morning and you order some bacon and eggs and some toast and then you look around in the diner and you think it was like 1975 when the windows were last washed.

Speaker 1:          00:46          And there's this kind of thick coating of who gives a damn grease on the walls, you know, and, and the floor to has got that sort of stickiness that you really have to work out to develop over years, you know, and the waitress is, she's not happy to be there and the guy behind the counter isn't happy that, that happens to be the waitress that he's working with. And then, you know, you walk down the stairs maybe to the washroom and now it's its own little trip and so you come back and you order your damn eggs and you order your toast in the order your bacon and then it comes in like the eggs are too cooked on the bottom. So they're kind of brown and then they're kind of raw on top and they're cold in the middle, which is, you really have to work their cooking egg like that man.

Speaker 1:          01:30          But you can master that with like 10 years of bitterness. You teach you how to cook an egg like that. And then the toast, here's what you do with the toast, right? You put, you take, you take the white bread, you know the precise stuff that no one should ever eat and then you put that in the toaster and you overcook it and then you wait and then you pop it out of the toaster and then cause it's overcooked. You scrape it off and you knock off the crumbs so it doesn't look too bird and then you wait till it's cold and then you put cold margin on it because if you put cold march, first of all, not butter, but if you put cold margarine or you can also kind of tear holes in it so then it has lumps of margarine in it and it's really dry except where it's too greasy. So that's like it's own little work of art man. And then you put that on the side with the, with the, with the eggs and then you have the potatoes and this is how you cook the potatoes properly.

Speaker 1:          02:28          So the leftover potatoes and you keep dumping new leftover potatoes into the old leftover potatoes over weeks. And so some of the potatoes, if they're no longer potatoes, right? They've have return to mother earth, then you flop them on the grill and you sort of had to know you burned them a bit I guess, and then you slap them on the plate and Jesus, you don't want to eat those man. That's for sure. And that's the point. And then you have the bake and then you want to make sure you buy the lowest possible quality bacon. That's how I start. And then you throw it on the grill and you don't. Your grill has to be overheated to do this, you have to cook the Bacon so that it's raw and places and burnt in other places and it has that delightful like older. They'd only really cheap, badly cooked bacon can provide or maybe you use those little breakfast sausages that no one in their bloody right mind would let within 15 feet of anything living, you know. And then you serve that right and you serve it with the kind of orange juice that is only orange in color and, and with coffee, that's.

Speaker 1:          03:46          What would you say it was started too early in the morning. That's the first thing. Bad quality coffee started too early in the morning route. God called once or twice and has been reheated, and then you serve that with whitener. It's like, here is your breakfast. It's like, no man, that's not breakfast. That's hell

Speaker 2:          04:17          no,

Speaker 1:          04:18          and and you created it and then what you do if you have a diner like that is because you have a miserable life. If you have a diner like that and you've really worked on achieving that is every night you go home and you curse your wife and you curse your kids and you fucking well curse God to for producing a universe where a diner like yours is allowed to exist and that's your bloody life.
