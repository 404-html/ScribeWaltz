Speaker 1:          00:00          Let's say you're socially anxious. Okay, so what happens when you're socially anxious? You go to a party, your heart's beating. Why? The party is a monster. Why? Because it's judging you and it's judging you. It's putting you low down the dominance hierarchy because that's what a negative judgment is and that interferes with your sexual soul success. And that means that you're being harshly evaluated by nature itself, right? So you are confronting the dragon of chaos when you go into the social situation. And so what do you do? You like this? So you hunch over and that's low dominance. I'm no threat. It's like, Whoa, that's not going to get you very far, you know, but that's a logical thing to do in, in the, in the face of a tyrant. So I'm no threat. You know, you look at the king and your dad, I'm no threat, I'm hunched over.

Speaker 1:          00:50          And then what's happening internally? How are, what are people thinking about me? What are people thinking about me or am I looking stupid? Am I looking foolish? Geez, I'm awkward. I hate being here, man. I'm sweating too much. It's all internalized, right? It's all self focused, the, the, the, I isn't work, the eye isn't working. What do you tell people? Stop. Don't stop thinking about yourself because you can't. It's like, don't think of a white elephant, white elephant, White, elephant, White, elephant. You can't tell someone to stop thinking about something because they get caught in the loop. What you do with socially anxious people as you say, look at other people. Look at them. Right? Why? Because if you look at them, you can tell what they're thinking and then you, unless you're. Unless you're terribly socialized and some people are, some people have no social skills and so the reason they can't go to a party is because they don't even know how to introduce themselves.

Speaker 1:          01:44          Like they're just no one ever taught them how to behave and so they're really good candidates for behavior therapy because you walk them through the process of how you actually manifest the procedures that are associated with social acceptability. But most people aren't like that. They have the ability. So if they're really introverted in high in neuroticism, they can usually talk quite well to someone one on one. Why? Because they look at them all. If I look at you, it's another thing to do. If you're ever speaking to a group of people, never speak to the group of people there that doesn't exist. You talk to individuals and then they reflect for you the entire group because they're all in trained. You look at one person, they broadcast to you what everyone's thinking and you know how to talk to one person. So it's easy. So as soon as you focus on the person, not you, you push your attention outward.

Speaker 1:          02:39          Use Your I push your attention outward and you start watching. Well then all your automatic mechanisms kick in and you start being awkward because if we're talking and I'm looking here, I don't know what you're going to do next and I'm going to put disjunctions into the like. They're like a bad chords and the melody of our, of our conversation. And the reason is I'm not paying attention. So that's why the I is the thing at the top of the pyramid. It's like the thing that enables you to win the set of all possible dominance hierarchies is the I pay attention. Pay Attention. That's the critical issue. That's why the Egyptians worshiped horace. That's why horace was the thing that rescued Osiris from the, from the depths. It's the capacity to pay attention. What do you pay attention to? Most? What? Your right hemisphere signals as anomalous.

Speaker 1:          03:28          It attracts your attention. It's like this isn't going quite right. I'm not looking at that wrong. That's what you look at. That's what you look at. What's not going right, because that's. See, that's the terrible monster that might eat you, but it's also the place you get all the information, so that's why it's useful to have discussions with your enemies because they will tell you things you do not know and that's such a great thing because if you don't know them well, you're not very smart, are you? You know there may be a time when you go somewhere, that's the thing you need to know and maybe your enemy will kill you. Why you're such a fool, you know, and a bunch of other things that aren't true to, but even one thing that's accurate, it's like, yeah, thanks very much man. Maybe I'll do some work on that and I won't have to carry that forward. So. And then that's part of the reason again why the terrible predator. It's always the terrible Predator that has the gold. It's like it's the person who delivers the message you do not want to hear. So it's rough, it's rough, but it doesn't matter. Life is rough.
