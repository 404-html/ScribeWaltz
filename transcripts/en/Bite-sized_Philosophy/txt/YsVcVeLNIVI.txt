Speaker 1:          00:00          Mother made some pancakes for billy about the dragon, ate the mall, mother made some more, but the dragon eight, those two mother kept making pancakes until she ran out of batter. Billy only got one of them, but he said that's all he really wanted. Anyway, so I'll tell you another story about that. So when I lived in Boston, I had little kids and uh, my wife took care of some neighborhood little kids because she didn't have a green card and that was, she was home with the kids anyways. And anyway, she took care of some other little kids. One of them would only eat hot dogs. That was quite funny. You'd only eat hotdogs at his mother's place booked at our house. He ate all of his lunch and he was perfectly happy about it. So I thought that was quite amusing too. But anyways, one day a neighbor came by and the neighbor had a four year old child and the neighbor was looking for someone to take care of the child because her nanny had been in a car accident and couldn't take care of the child temporarily.

Speaker 1:          01:01          So the child had sort of been circulating around neighborhood houses for a couple of days and you know, people were taking care of him, then he ended up at our house and um, which was fine. And so he's a cute little guy and uh, his, the mother came to the door and she said she's, you know, pushed the boy and he was Kinda like, this wasn't very happy. And um, she said he probably won't eat all day, but that's okay. And I thought, hmm, that's a, that's a remarkably interesting statement to, you know, to, to put forth as a proposition the first time we meet your son, it's like he won't eat all day, which by the way is not okay, it's not okay and you're going to tell us that it's okay and you're going to expect that we're just going to accept the fact that you think it's okay.

Speaker 1:          01:51          And that's, that's the whole story. You deliver all that information in one little sentence. So I thought, well, that's pretty damn peculiar. Uh, I believe she was a psychologist too, which was quite interesting. So. Okay, so that's fine. So I went out to do something and there was four kids playing in the house and when I came back the little guy was in the porch, like wear the boots were at everything and he was sort of standing there like this and I thought, hmm, that's not good because there's all these other kids. Like he should've been in there playing a lot obviously that that's what a child is primed to do. He should've been in there messing about with, I think there was a two year old, a three year old and another four year old. He should've been in there, you know, causing trouble and having fun and playing.

Speaker 1:          02:32          But he wasn't, he was standing in the porch like this and he wasn't happy. He wasn't happy. So I looked at him for a bit and then I poked him a couple of times because I thought, you know, if you're interacting with little kids, they're very playful a, they're kind of like puppies. And so if you, if you tease them a bit and tickled them a bit, then usually even if they're crabby, you know, a smile break out that despite their best efforts and then they'll sort of giggle then maybe you know, they'll try to whack you away and they, you know, they, they go into a play routine and although you may not know it, mammals like us have a place circuit in also. So we're intrinsically playful, which is partly why we can get along with dogs because of course dogs are intrinsically playful and most people know how to play with the dog and you know, when a dog wants to play, right?

Speaker 1:          03:16          Because it sort of puts his paws down and looks up at you and Sorta grants and puts its tail in the air and goes like dance. It's like clue in primate, you know, it's time to engage in some playing and you know, you basically know how to do that. And even the dog knows how to do that. So I'm poking this kid and trying to get them to smile, but there's no damn way, you know, I'm poking him. He's just ignoring me like mad and I thought, that's not good, you know, because you don't want your four year old to have learned that you should. You should, that it's okay to ignore adults or that you should ignore adults or that you can ignore adults. That's all bad because the world's full of adults and they know a lot of things and they control all the resources and so you better get along with them.

Speaker 1:          03:58          Plus you're going to end up as an adult for most of your life. So if the general, you know, if the first rule is adults can and should be ignored, then what the hell are you headed for? You know, and it's one of the reasons that it's really useful to made sure the children respect adults because they're going to be adults. So if they don't respect adults, then of course they don't have any respect for what they're going to be. Why the hell grow up? You end up like Peter Pan Because that's what Peter Parents about, right? Peter Pan Wants to stay at Neverland with the lost boys were where there's no responsibility because you know, he looks at the future and only sees his captain hook a tyrant who's afraid of death. That's the crocodile, right? It's chasing him with a clock in its stomach. And it's the same thing as this dragon.

Speaker 1:          04:45          So, you know, kids have to respect adults. It's, you're doing them a disservice if they don't. So okay, so fine. I'm poking this kid. There's just no damn way. I'm not getting anywhere with them and I thought this isn't good. There's something deeply wrong with this little kid, so that's fine. So then we said all the kids down for lunch and the rule is your damn lunch and be thankful for it because you think about this. Leonard Cohen wrote this song once about, I don't remember the song particularly, but he talked about the homicidal bitching that goes down in every kitchen about who is going to serve and who's going to eat. It's like if you haven't encountered that, then there's something terribly wrong. You know, so because a lot of the tension in in households is domestic tension, the tension between husbands and wives or husbands, wives and children.

Speaker 1:          05:31          It's like just who the hell is going to do the domestic duties and how and when and the answer can't be, well, we're not going to do them because then you know, you eat cheetos and popcorn and you know, for the rest of your life and that's not good. It's gotten to the point in England because the domestic situations have deteriorated. The rituals have deteriorated to such a point that about one slash third of families no longer have a dining room table and you can buy precooked hard boiled eggs. Yeah, yeah. Right. You know, it's not a good thing. And you might ask yourself why the hell everyone is either fat or has an eating disorder. And you know, part of the reason is, is that the entire domestic routine around regulating food intake has disappeared. And that's a terrible thing for people because we're social eaters.

Speaker 1:          06:16          So you might say, well if you sit down with a bunch of other people at a table, how much should you eat? And the answer is you should eat on average what everyone else eats. And that's exactly what you do. Even if you don't notice it, you know, people are so wired into. We did experiments like this. If you, if you bring on have you bring undergraduates who don't know each other into a lab and you give them a snack while they're doing something like watching a movie, they will eat the same number of chips. So you know, if one of the meets the whole half the thing, the other real you'd have if one only has one, the other only have one. The correlation between the food intake between the dyads was about point eight. It was staggering. It seemed to be a little higher for extroverts than for introverts, but it was remarkably remarkably can coordinate and you can understand why, right?

Speaker 1:          07:06          Because human being shared food, it's like you are not going to be a popular tribes person if you eat, you know, 30 percent of the food when food is in short supply, you better be bloody awake and make sure that you don't take more than your share and you know, it's a fundamental element of human nature to do that. And, and we also regulate our sense of satiety by cues that are external to us. So regulating our food intake also because we're omnivores, turns out to be a tremendously difficult thing and well, anyways, back to this kid. So we bring all the kids to the table and they're sitting around in there having lunch and the rule is, as I said, eat what is in front of you and be pleased and happy about it. So you might say, well why would that also be a rule?

Speaker 1:          07:52          It's like, okay, put yourself in this position now because you'll be in this position. You're going to cook your damn kids some lunch and you're going to do that. Well, let's, let's calculate it out because I like doing arithmetic. So let's say it takes you half an hour a day and you do it seven days a week, but we'll multiply that by three because there's three meals. So it's an hour and a half a day, right? So okay, fine. Seven times an hour and a half is roughly 10. So it's 10 hours a week. It's 40 hours a month, right? Forty hours a month is a full work week. So 40 hours a month times 12, 12 full work weeks, right? Yes. That's three full months of 40 hour days of cooking something for your damn kid. Now that's a lot of time and then you're going to do that for 18 years. So then you might ask yourself what sort of response do you need from your child in order to not feel resentful and miserable about the fact that you have to do that for three bloody months this year and you just have to think about this and this is also why it's necessary to know inside yourself.

Speaker 1:          08:56          You carry a monster just like the world outside you carries a monster. Do not think that you're going to be able to maintain a healthy attitude towards your child or towards food or towards yourself. If all you can muster up for the effort of cooking and preparing food is the attitude of a slave and continual punishment from the people that you're offering food too. It's like, who the hell wants that? So you want to teach them miserable little bladder that he's lucky that there's any food there at all and that the proper attitude is to say, really thank you very much mom or thank you very much dad. I'm glad that you produce something and then you know, you can be all happy about the fact that you were slaving away in the kitchen and you can like your kid. So, and you know, you might think, well everybody likes their kids.

Speaker 1:          09:39          It's like, yeah, right. No that's not true. That's not true. And now, and then, you know, you read in the newspaper about someone who's, you know, being pushed a little bit too far on some day that they're unemployed and hung over and you know, the relationship is just broken up and they do something absolutely brutal to their child. And you think, well, how could anyone do that? It's like there's a lot of history of terrible interactions between the mother and the child or the father and the child before something like that happens. So, you know, if you want to protect your child against the beast that's inside you, you might want to teach them to treat you with some respect so that you're much more likely to be a civilized human being around them. So, all right, so anyways, so this kid sit in there and there's no damn way he's going to eat anything.

Speaker 1:          10:23          So we decide we're going to feed him, which I'm an expert at because my, my son. And the one who said no all the time, he was the most stubborn little custom you could possibly imagine. And one time when he was about nine months old, he got ahold of the spoon and it was like he was not going to be fat anymore. Hey. So that's fine. Good. You know, it's like feed yourself, but no kids say they're too damn curious and playful really to feed themselves. So you sit them in a high chair and then, you know, they fling the food onto the floor because that's pretty cool. They could watch that over and over in order they mess around with it or maybe they, you know, put some in mum's hair because that's interesting too. And they have two or three bites and then they're not ravenous and then they're much more interested in playing and that's fine except that kid does need.

Speaker 1:          11:05          Then it gets crabby and you know, whiny and miserable. And then it just disturbs the mother or the father and then it won't sleep at night. It's like, that's no good. So after about three days of that, I took the spoon back from him and he was not happy about that man trying to get that little kid to eat. Once I got the spoon, it was like a four hour battle. It was really remarkable. So I, I, I, I, a lot of respect for his ability to withstand stubbornness, you know, but I had learned by that time as a parent that like if you want to discipline your child, you, there's an attitude you have to take, which is I am going to win this. Like I don't care how stubborn you are, I am going to win. And because I know I'm going to win, I'm not going to get angry.

Speaker 1:          11:47          I'm just gonna out stubborn you. And so. So I take up some food and put it in front of him. He'd go like this. So that was a good trick. And so I try to get the food in there and his teeth regretted. So I poke, poke, poke, poke, poke. And after about 10 pokes, he'd get annoyed and go and I put the food yet then he tried to spit it out. So I'd hold it, the editing this. So then. So that was like three minutes, you know, and then we did it with another spoonful and you know, after about, I'd say an hour of this, my wife had to leave because it was like she just couldn't handle it and I bought an hour after this he decided that, you know, it was okayed and then he would let me feed them. But like it was brutal and it was amazing.

Speaker 1:          12:29          I mean little kids are so damn tough, you know, they're really cute and everything and, but they're so tough you just can't believe it. So anyways. So we had this good at the table and he was not going to eat. So my wife who'd learned these tricks by this time decided to feed him and he had a lot of sort of nine months old or eight month old behaviors because you don't. Kids have different strategies of resistance if they don't want to do something and those strategies get more sophisticated as they get older. But. And he had some strategies but they weren't sophisticated, you know, like he didn't make jokes or knocked the spoon away or, or get angry or, or run away or any of those things. He did kind of nine months old things, which means he just put his head down and when she put the spoon towards him, he just covered his head one way or another.

Speaker 1:          13:13          So. So that was interesting because I knew that his parents had given up feeding him when he was about eight or nine months old because those tricks worked. And so that's why she could come to the house and say he probably won't eat all day, but that's all right. Which it isn't, it's not all right. So fine. So my wife is trying to feed him and he doesn't open his mouth so she pokes him a bit and sooner or later he gets mad and you know, goes and she puts the food in and she does. And then she pats him on the head as soon as he swallows it and says, look, you're being a really good kid. You know, you're doing a good job. And then, so he's wondering what the hell is going on. And then it was so interesting because she kept feeding him and he was still doing this, but as she patted them on the head, he'd be doing this and he'd open his mouth.

Speaker 1:          13:56          So it was like there was this weird conflict between his habitual behavior and this thing that was being reinforced. So then she put food in and pat him and he, you know, he'd be kind of happy about that. And then he'd go back to his routine and then she did that for I think about 20 minutes. It wasn't disruptive like all the other kids ate. They didn't even really notice what was going on. It wasn't, it wasn't a big deal, you know, but I was watching because I knew something was up because the stupid thing that his mother said and then the fact that he wouldn't play and he ignored me, I thought, Nah, there's some reading not good here, this dragon here. And it's a big one. So she feeds him and then he finishes the whole bowl. It's like. And she says, you're a good boy.

Speaker 1:          14:36          You ate the whole bowl and Jesus, you should have seen what happened to that kid. Man, it just about broke my heart, like really, like his eyes got big and he smiled and he was just like, he was super thrilled because he'd finally accomplished this absolute basic necessity that he hadn't mastered in four years. He finally got it right. You think of all the meals that he went through either being ignored or failing three times a day for like three years, nothing but failure and bad responses and you know, he didn't turn light all that. He thought he was a bad kid and then all of a sudden he figured this out and you know, get a little reward for. It was like he just lit up and that whole shell that he had on the that he was like using to protect himself when he was in the porch.

Speaker 1:          15:20          That just melted away. It was like, it was horrifying and amazing at the same time. And then he followed my wife around after that in the house, just like a puppy dog, like he wouldn't get. He would not get more than one foot away from her. It was unbelievable. And then we went downstairs to watch like a movie with the kids and she sat on a rocking chair and he climbed right up on her lap and grabbed her just like that. Harlow monkey grabbed the, you know, the little soft mother instead of the winery mother for teams like this. And he was like that for like two hours. He wouldn't let her go. So then the mother came home, his mother came home and she came downstairs and she looked at what was going on, you know, when this kid was like glommed onto my wife and she looked at her and she said, oh supermom.

Speaker 1:          16:06          And you know, took her kid and went home. It's like Jesus, like if you don't think there's a dragon and that story, man, you are not listening to it. It was not good. And her response at the end was terrible. She should've said, well, how do you get them to eat? It's like, what? What the hell is he doing? Like, hugging you? He never does that to me. No way man. She was going to let that piece of information in and it's no wonder because the dragon and that story was her and it was something she did not want to admit and she was willing, perfectly willing to sacrifice her child to that, to her failure to realize that she could be a dragon. So that meant that the child was the problem and that's a hell of a thing to do to a four year old. So it was not pleasant. It was really not pleasant. In fact, we probably did damage to the child by actually getting them to do something good day because we opened up him up to the possibility that he could behave properly and be rewarded for that. And that gave them hope. And so you can bloody well be sure that that hope was dispensed with the next day.

Speaker 2:          17:13          So.

Speaker 1:          17:15          And that's why bill, he doesn't get anything to eat.
