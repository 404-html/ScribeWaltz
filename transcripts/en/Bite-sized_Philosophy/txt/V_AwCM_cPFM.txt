Speaker 1:          00:00          Sure. Hi Dr Peterson over the last couple of weeks and further back, you talk a lot about consciousness and the importance of it and I was hoping to get your opinion on an issue of consciousness that has often seen Christianity among other groups and politics kind of clash, so I'm hoping to get your views on the consciousness or lack thereof of a human fetus and how that's impacted your views on abortion, whatever they are and any.

Speaker 2:          00:28          Cool. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so the first question is do I have an answer for that? That's a good enough answer to actually reveal. No, I don't, but I'll. I'll I can flail about a little bit around it. Abortion is clearly wrong. Don't think anybody debates that you wouldn't recommend that someone that you love have one. Okay. Now, having clarified that that mere statement doesn't eliminate the complexity of the situation. The first question is, is should everything wrong be illegal? That's a tough question. Everything that's wrong isn't illegal. Then there's the additional complication of the difference, let's say, in gravity regarding the problem in relationship to men and women and we don't know how to deal with that. Having said that, I would say that it's actually the wrong question. There's something Leonard Cohen said once he said that in a massacre, there's no decent place to stand, and what he meant by that was sometimes you're aware there is no good decision left, no matter what you do. It's wrong.

Speaker 2:          02:11          So then the question is how did you get there? Well, let's say you're in a position where you are inclined to seek an abortion. The question is, how did you get there? Now we have a lot to straighten out about the sexual relationships between men and women. In the modern world, they're bent and warped and demented out of shape. One of the things I see with young people, for example, is that they will engage in sexual acts with one another that they would not talk about with one another. I mean, couples will do that for that matter, like married couples will do that, but they're married. That's a different story. It seems to me that if you are willing to engage in a sexual act with someone with whom you would not discuss that act, you probably put the cart before the horse, so the discussion regarding the legality of abortion is nested inside a larger discussion about the morality of abortion and that's nested inside a larger discussion about the proper place of sexuality and human behavior and to me that's the level at which the problem needs to be addressed. Now I don't have the answer to that. You know, because they will answer was get married now. It's a good answer and it's an answer that people should still listen to, but we'll put that aside momentarily.

Speaker 2:          03:34          I had a client at one point who was, I don't know, she was probably. I'm not going to disguise her in a variety of different ways. She was 27, 20 or thereabouts, had come from a relatively conservative background, quite a timid, fearful person and also not very well, not sophisticated in relationship to relationships and she'd never had sex. Well, there's a bunch of things she'd never done. Well,

Speaker 2:          04:03          the answer from me to her wasn't continued to be timid about everything because that wasn't working out for her. She needed to go have some adventures. Now, sexual adventures like other adventures are dangerous and so you have to be very careful when you encourage people to go out and have adventures, but, but, but too much. Timidity and caution also constitutes a pathway to perdition. Let's say you can't just say to people in the morning world while you know, sex till you're married, unless you're going to get married when you're very young and perhaps you should. I don't know about that, but I don't think that we're mature enough as a culture to have a serious discussion about sexual impropriety, especially in the aftermath of the birth control pill. And we seriously need to do that and we have it. And so I think the eternal debate about abortion, horrible as it is, is a,

Speaker 2:          05:04          it's the surface manifestation of a much deeper problem. Now I talked a little bit today about the utility of marriage, like the spiritual utility of marriage, and that's something that I think we're so immaturely cynical as a culture like we don't. We're not wise enough to look at an institution like marriage and to really think about what it means and what it signifies. It signifies a place that people can tie the ropes of their lives together so that they're stronger. It signifies a place where people can tell the truth to one another. It signifies a place where sexuality can properly be integrated into life. That's no easy. That's no easy task. It's a place where children, at least in principle, it can be put first and foremost as they should be once they exist, and so there's a much broader discussion that has to happen. I think before any concentration on the legality of abortion is labeled to get anywhere at all. That's what it looks like to me, so that's the best I can do with that question.

Speaker 3:          06:04          Thank you.
