Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay, here's the rats and this is from Yak Panksepp's work, right? He was the first guy who figured out the rest giggle and you might think, well, what kind of stupid thing is that to study? It's like $50,000 research grant for giggling rats, you know, so. But he discovered the place circuitry in mammals. That's a big deal, right? It's like discovering a whole new continent. There's a place circuit in mammals. It's built right in. So it's not socially constructed. There's A. There's a biological platform for that. And so what? What? What panksepp would do with rats, he found out if rats, if you take a rat pup away from its mother, it dies. Even if you feed it, even if it keep it warm, it dies. Now you can stop it from dying by taking a pencil with an eraser on the end and massaging it right? Because rats won't live without love.

Speaker 1:          00:48          And the same thing happens to human babies. And we saw that in Romania when there was that catastrophe have to Chesko in the orphanages were the orphanages were full of unwanted babies because Joe Chesko insisted that every Romanian women was constantly pregnant. So the orphanage just stacked up with unwanted babies and lots of them didn't even have names and they were warehoused. Warmth, shelter, food, devastating. Lots of them died. Most of them died before the first year. And the ones that didn't die, we're permanently dysfunctional because you have to be touched. If you're a human being, it's not an option you have to be played with. It's not an option, it's, it's part of neurodevelopmental necessity. And, and you have to also play fair, so because otherwise you produce a very disjointed child who isn't able to engage in the niceties of social interaction, which is continual play in some sense in reciprocity.

Speaker 1:          01:39          So what Panksepp did with his wrath, he noticed the male rats, juveniles really liked to wrestle and they wrestle just like humans beings wrestle. They pin each other for crying out loud with like that, that have just lost. He's down for a 10 count. Right? And so, so what do you do is you take juvenile routes and you can find out that they want to play because you can attach a spring to the and then they'll try to run and you can measure how hard they're running by, how hard they're pulling on the spring and then you can estimate how motivated they are. And so you can find out that a nice, well fed rat who doesn't have anything on his mind will still work hard to play if it, to enter a, an arena where he's been allowed to play before, he'll work for that. So then you think, well the rats motivated so the two rats go out there and they play and, and so they're, they're playing like dogs play and everyone knows what that looks like.

Speaker 1:          02:30          If you're, you know, if you have any sense about dogs that kind of go like this and kids do that and maybe you do that with your wife if you're going to play with her a little bit. My poor wife man, when she, she was, uh, she was uh, uh, a young. She had older siblings and so she wasn't played with as much when she was little, as she might've been in. Um, I used to like, you know, if you take a pillow and you go like this three times, right? That means look out a pillow is coming your way. So I go one, two, three. Wow. When she looked, she was completely dismayed and he's like, what do you do that for? And I thought, well, I eventually tartar that rule. The other thing I used to, the other thing I used to do, you know, is sometimes she'd come out and be like this when we were playing around and I grabbed her wrist and I know Parker her hands through her knuckles together and she used to just get completely annoyed about that and I thought, right, that's what you do. You just open your hands. While she didn't know that either. So she hadn't been played with enough when she was a little rat.

Speaker 2:          03:40          So

Speaker 1:          03:43          anyways. Anyways, so you let the route, the little rats go out there. Right. And so let's imagine one of them is 10 percent bigger than the other. And so that 10 percent bigger wins because 10 percent is enough in rat wait to ensure that you're going to be the pinner rather than the penny. Okay? So. So that's fine. So when the rat, the rat pins the pins a little route and now the big rat is the is the authority rat. And so then the next time that the rats play, the little rat has to invite the big rat to play. So the big rats out there being cool and a little rat pops up and you know, does the whole will you play with me thing? And the big rat will deign to play with them. But if you pair them repeatedly, unless the big rat lets the little rat win, 30 percent of the time the little rat will not invite him to play.

Speaker 1:          04:29          And panksepp discovered that. It's like, I read that. That just blew me away. It's like, that is so amazing because you see walls first of there, there's an analogy to Piaget's ideas about the emergence of morality out of play in human beings. So that was very cool. But the notion that that was built into rats at the level of wrestling was, and they're social, they're deeply social animals, right? They have to know how to get along with one another and most of their authority disputes, dominance, dispute. You don't want them to end in bloodshed and combat because you know, if your rag one and two and we tear each other just threat shreds and the dominance dispute rack three is just going to move in. It's really not a great strategy. And so it'd be better if we could settle our differences, you know, somewhat peacefully and so while.

Speaker 1:          05:14          So rats. Anyways, panksepp figured out that rats plan, not only do they play, they play fair and they seem to enjoy it. He also figured out, this was really cool too, that if you give juvenile rats attention deficit disorder drugs, Ritalin suppresses, pray, play. So that's worth thinking about. It's like, well, why do you have to give juvenile human beings amphetamines in school? Well, because they need to play. Well you don't, you don't get to play. They don't get to wrestle around. I mean, that's oppression as far as I can tell. They don't get to wrestle around. That's fine. Feed him some amphetamines, man. That'll shut down the old place circuits. Well, here's the other problem is Panksepp found that if you don't let juvenile male rats play their prefrontal cortexes don't develop properly. Surprise, surprise. You're not letting them mature. It's like, what else would you expect? So, you know, that's something to think about really hard. I would say.
