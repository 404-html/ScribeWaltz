Speaker 1:          00:00          I was thinking about the issue of discrimination in relationship to sex because I've been thinking a lot about discrimination lately because everybody thinks discrimination is a bad idea, which is a very stupid proposition because you're discriminating all the time and the most fundamental form of discrimination is choice of sexual partner. And so you might say, well why should that even be allowed? Because it is the most fundamental form of discrimination. So for example, almost everyone is racially prejudice when it comes to sexual partners. So you think, well, is that, is that, uh, what about, uh, are you do use age as an exclusionary criteria? Probably do use physical attractiveness only in so far as you're able, right? You use it completely. If you could get away with it roughly speaking, but you can't because the most attractive people aren't going to be anywhere near you.

Speaker 1:          00:50          So you can't do it. But you'd like to. Health yes. Strength. Yes. Wealth, yes. Education, definitely. So it's unbelievably discriminatory. And so you might say, well why is that justifiable? And it seems to me that it's something like, well, you get to say no to me if I get to say no to you. It's something like that. We've agreed that everybody gets to discriminate on that basis and because everybody can do it then it's fair. It's something like that. It's very much we're thinking about, you know, I don't know if you know this, but in Huxley's brave new world where the family had been completely demolished rate and children were conceived in bottles and given an produced in factories. So the whole idea of the relationship between sex and procreation had become a taboo. One of the Mantras, the slogans of the society was everyone belongs to everyone else. And so it was actually a social full pause to refuse to sleep with someone just as it was a social for Paul to have any exclusionary relationship. Because another thing that you might notice is that there's nothing more discriminatory than falling in love with someone. It's like you're special and all the rest of you know. So it's the ultimate exclusionary act. Right? And yet we presume that that's an acceptable, not only acceptable. We demand that as a, as a right and well, that's where thinking about a lot.
