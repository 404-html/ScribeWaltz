Speaker 1:          00:00          Alright, so you're always in one of these little frameworks and there's just no getting out of it. So, and that's because you know, at any given moment this is like, it's like field theory. There used to be psychological theories that talked about the field of human experience, something like that. And this is kind of what that is. This is a field and basically what happens is you parse out a little part of the world say and so an amount you can handle. So let's say it has some duration. You're not aiming at something 50 years in the future. It's because how the hell are you going to do that? There's too many variables, you know, so you're aiming at some handleable amount of time and you, it a goal in there and you plot your route and then that tells you what's up and tells you what's down. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:44          moves you towards the goal and down moves you away from the goal and that sets up your motivational framework so that you have some worth attaining. You know, that's a really interesting thing to know too. It's like why have a goal ball? It's easy, no goal, no positive emotion because you experienced positive emotion by noticing that you're moving towards a goal and so if you don't have to have a goal while you can't have any positive emotion, so better have a goal, and so you might say, well, what should the goal be? Well, we could start by saying, well, any goal is better than none, and then we might say, well, it should be a goal that other people will let you pursue because otherwise it's going to be kind of difficult and maybe there'll be even happy to help you pursue it. That would even be better and maybe it's a goal that would enable you to learn how to pursue other goals while you pursue that goal.

Speaker 1:          01:35          Boy, that would really be good, and so you can see that your goal is parameterized, but that doesn't mean that any old goal works. It means there's some goals that were nicely and some not so nicely. There are playable games and no unplayable games. That's a good way of thinking about it and you want to have a playable game and there's a lot of them. Lawyer, plumber, you know, actor, whatever, they're, they're playable games and, and it's not obvious which ones better, but it's certainly obvious which ones are sustainable and which ones are worse and so there's a set of playable games and you need to extract from that set of playable games, a game that suits you and that would be partly due to your temperament, you know, because extroverted people want to play an extroverted game and highly neurotic people want to play a safe game and agreeable people want to play a generous game and disagreeable people wanting to play a game that's highly competitive so they can win and you know, fine, but they're all within the realm of playable games and that means they're socially acceptable as well.

Speaker 1:          02:38          And so that means it isn't just arbitrary, it isn't just relative what you decide to do. It's heavily parameterized. There's only, there's a set of playable games and it's large. The set is large, but it, there are commonalities within it. And that's why there are commonalities. That's why morality has a common basis fundamentally. And so that's partly what we're trying to investigate is like, what's up? What does that mean? What does it mean? Is there such a thing? Now, one thing to remember is that if you don't direct a hierarchical structure with a someday, Matt, you got no positive motivation because you experience positive motivation in relationship to a goal, not from attaining the goal, that satisfaction, and besides it's fleeting, you know perfectly well, you graduate from university, Poof, next day you have a problem, which is what do you do next? And that's a, that's a tough problem. It's not like you've solved your problems by winning that game, you just introduced the problem of having to introduce another game. So it's unreliable as a source of positive emotion. But what's reliable is you set a goal and you try to attain it. And then that gives your life that literally provides your life with meaning. That's what meaning is. Now it's more than that, but that's what it is. And so then you might ask yourself, well, what's a really good goal? Well, that's what we're trying to figure out. What's a really good goal.
