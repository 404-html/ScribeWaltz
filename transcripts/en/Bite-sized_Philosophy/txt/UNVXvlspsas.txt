Speaker 1:          00:00          Uh, the first one I say, from my understanding, the essential problems with epistemology derive from the nature of language and axioms upon which various underlying linguistic structures are based. And then afterwards interpreted, as you have said in your videos, the probability that you construe some of the same definitions of insert random word, person says, and in the same way are virtually zero, or one of the best examples I can give for this is the language that is used in physics. It is widely misconstrued as the pragmatic meanings behind words and their contexts are worlds debased from the vague linguistic constructed views of the actual linguistic, uh, definitions that people construe so, such as the problem with the word dimension, dimension in which it is understood in the semantic sense, but not in an abstract sense in which the word is implied. The first chapter of Einstein's theory of special and general relativity, Einstein stresses that geometry is an abstract model. Time per se is not the dimension. The theory of special relativity merely treats any one clock time as dimension of an abstract construct. So for the next three questions I have, I want this to be considered as a means of,

Speaker 2:          01:17          okay, so, so my answer to that, fundamentally I think the best answer to that was provided by the American pragmatists and that'd be William James and his crew. That would include guiding her pierce P I e R, c e m who was perhaps the, you know, the best floors for the American, the US ever produced cns pierce, but somewhat under appreciated and certainly so in his own life. Part of the way that different people hone in on the same definition is to define what an acceptable outcome would be to their joint interactions and then to hone their language until they achieve that outcome. And then to consider that good enough. I would say pearson, his crew basically said that you could never do anything better than that. So let's say that we're trying to. Let's say we're trying to communicate about how we're going to move a wheelbarrow full of bricks from one side of the yard to the other. Well, basically what we've decided is we've communicated good enough if the bricks get moved. And so, so what you have to do is you have to set up a practical surround in some sense around your conversation and the practical surround constitutes what you are willing to consider as proof that conversation or that communication has taken place sufficiently.

Speaker 2:          02:46          I mean that's partly, it's complicated and it's partly why the robotics engineers tried, like Rodney Brooks were discovered back in the 19 eighties that you really couldn't have intelligent machines without embodiment because you need a real world target against which to measure the effectiveness of your communication. Because as you said, I mean this is where the postmodern is to have it right, is that there is a lot of different ways of interpreting everything. So how do you know when your interpretation is good enough? And the answer to that is you agree a priority. What would constitute good enough? And when you hit that target, then you're done.

Speaker 1:          03:25          Oh, thank you. And I'll look into CSPS.

Speaker 2:          03:28          Yep. Cs Paris. Yep. Yeah. Look up the American pragmatists and go to bright man.

Speaker 1:          03:34          Alright. And then so, and then the next one is on transgenderism and conservative. Strongly boast of biological and scientific claim of two genders or two sexes based on what language we're going to use. Um, they believe and I believe, right, fully so in biological differences between males and females, but I've never heard a liberal argue and from my perspective, I think I could partially combat this, but it's an argument that hasn't been raised from the liberal side, which I think should have, um, biological differences in the brain. Women can see more shades of color on average and men can have better spatial orientation. On average. I'm Steven.

Speaker 2:          04:16          There's massive neurological and biological differences between women are well documented, but the postmodernist types just assume that the scientist who conducted the investigations are suffering from the same bias that they think permeates everything else. So they just discounted.

Speaker 1:          04:32          Yes. So is it, is it really crazy to believe that someone could be born with biological similarities to an x, y, brain and biological? Excellent.

Speaker 2:          04:41          Not at all. Not at all. No. That is the argument that I'm making. The argument I'm making is that gender identity is strongly influenced by biological sex. The problem is is that the legislation, especially the legislation that's being introduced in Canada, argues that it's not. That's just not helpful. It's not even helpful for the transgendered types because some of them for sure, there are people who have mixed biological sex women who have some cells in their body that have male chromosomes, trivial number for example, and there are people who are born with genitalia that are identifiable and there are more genuine hermaphroditic types and there is no different, no doubt that there are some men that have a more feminine personality structure in some women that have a more masculine personality structure and then that's biologically influenced. So I would separate. I'm not making a biological case that there are two genders that end.

Speaker 2:          05:40          Okay. Thank you. I'm making a biological. I'm making a case that sexual identity has been unbelievably powerfully influenced by biology with certain exceptions and those exceptions themselves might be biologically determined. Not In all cases but in many. And so part of the reason I was objecting to legislation like bill [inaudible] is because it insists that gender identity is socially constructed well. If gender identity is socially constructed, then why can't we just take transgender people and socialize them back into their. Into their normative sex roles? Exactly. Right. Exactly. So that's part of the reason I was objecting to the legislation. One of the most powerful arguments, and I said this, I did a presentation in front of the Canadian Senate. I don't know if you saw that or not. There's no reason for you to have paid attention to it, but if you look up Jordan Peterson and Senate, you'll see that as well along with a professor along with a practicing lawyer.

Speaker 2:          06:39          I made exactly that case to a number of Canadian senators telling them that by supporting this legislation, they were actually doing a disservice to the people that they purport to be helping. So that's, that's it, isn't that biologically there are two sexes, although a pr as an approximation. That's true. As a decent approximation. It's true. It gets slightly messy because we're our multiplicity of ways than sexuality and sex differences manifest themselves and those a fair bit of variability across all of those different manifestations. And so, as I said, you can have feminine man and a Masculine Male, masculine woman that happens very frequently. Um, it's just more often you have a feminine woman and a masculine man.

Speaker 1:          07:26          Alright, that perfectly explains my question. Okay. So next postmodern is thought, and I think you kind of already talked about this, um, when you said the American postmodernist got this right. And that I'm going to summarize very quickly because you've already answered, but like, um, you say that you see scientific realism is nested in Darwinian competition. And so it's reasonably objective that the,

Speaker 2:          07:57          oh no, no, that's not quite right. I would say that it isn't obvious to me that there is any truth that, that is super ordinary to, to the truth. It's established in the Darwinian fashion. And that includes our notion of, of objective reality. Now that's where Sam Harris and I had a major disagreement, but again, it has, it's a consequence of, of my pragmatic thinking. You see the Darwinian claim fundamentally is that the only way that you can come up with a definition of truth is throwing an evolutionary model that uses death as the punishment being wrong. And so one of the things I was arguing with with Sam Harris about is whether or not our current conceptualizations of objective truth are necessarily true in a Darwinian sense, and if they're not, which form of truth should take priority. And I was arguing the Darwinian truth should take priority and Sam was arguing that, well, well he didn't particularly like that stamps, although one of the law. And that's basically what our argument, what argument circulated around. So. So the problem is, see the problem is, is that we never know. Let's see, what's the problem? Exactly. Even our objective truth is seriously bounded in ways that we don't understand. Claim claim it as at any given moment as having some sort of fundamental ontological status outside of it's Darwinian utility strikes me as dangerous, especially given how trans mutable scientific theories tend to be.

Speaker 1:          09:37          So let's, if I'm going to oversimplify things, liberals tend to think with the anterior cingulate cortex of the brain with future applications, possibilities, likeliness consequences in conservative part of the brain that's involved in social cognition name and conservatives tend to trust it. So, um, yeah, I'm going to read what I wrote here. For example, low populations in rural areas would potentially possess more views of self photometry, working hard, family values, increasing population, protecting oneself, and one's kind due to the types of motivations and the hypothalamus being more applicable to survival while highly populated areas would focus potentially more on thinking tolerance, community values, stabilizing population, but additionally might not focus so much on protecting life or raising children. These differences could explain vastly the moral behaviors being ideally are objectively true based on incalculable variables.

Speaker 2:          10:38          So a better run. Run that through me. Again, it's quite complicated.

Speaker 1:          10:43          Yes it is. So I am suggesting that if we are to look at a, a reason why, how people think, we can look at how people think as being nested in Darwinian competition. So, so if, if there's a low populated area you would think, okay, what traits incalculable, but some somewhat telltale global trends would be unnecessary for them to be raised and what traits mostly in the hypothalamus I'm assuming and what traits would be more applicable for a large city. So it's almost completely possible that the politics of liberals is perfect for their situation in a big city, in the politics of conservatives as. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          11:29          this is one that you should think about. It is, it isn't. It's a reasonable hypothesis. I'd have to think it through a long time before, before because you're suggesting that a conservative philosophy is more useful in a.

Speaker 1:          11:45          yeah, low populated area. Possibly. Yeah. It's possible. I think. I don't know. It's worth thinking. All right. That's because I've been thinking about that a lot. That's my main. The main thing I think about, um, and I'm not saying necessarily directly that, but at least the possibility of. That's why

Speaker 2:          12:07          one thing you could do just to, to some degree to begin with is just run a correlation between size of the community and, and uh, and political proclivity you should go get that data on the light online wouldn't be approved because it might be the more liberal types are also more likely to move to the cities, right? In this case you'd be leading conservatives be hard and it's not because they're more well adopted by even then it might be because they're more well adapted into smaller communities. It's a good idea. I don't know what think of it, but it's worth thinking about.

Speaker 1:          12:41          Um, and we actually have that data just through political polls and you'll see whenever you look at a map it's all red because the red is in the smaller areas and the blue looks small because it was more people there. So it does

Speaker 2:          12:54          tendon, it's a plausible hypothesis. It might be interesting to look in the red states only and see if it's still true there.

Speaker 1:          13:02          Yes. Alright. So thank you for that. I mean it's, let that you, um, think of that as a possibility. And then one last question on religion, and I've been watching your, um, your psychological interpretations of the Bible as well as I have read the maps of meaning. Um, so I may have missed something there. Um, but this question, so neurophysiologically to my understanding, the way the human brain is constructed is such that happiness is achieved in the pursuit of a noble aim rather than the team of the goal itself. You've talked about this multiple times.

Speaker 2:          13:40          Yeah, yeah, yeah. That, it's not even, it's not happiness precisely, but that'll do. It's more like a sense of meaningful engagement, which I think is better than happiness, but that's okay. We can go with happiness for now.

Speaker 1:          13:51          All right. So if, if there's no noble aim, we are limited to simple pleasures which do not sustain sustainable.

Speaker 2:          13:57          That's exactly right. You're limited to impulsive pleasures. Yes. And those are ones that don't necessarily have a good medium to longterm outcome.

Speaker 1:          14:05          So if I am to take a psychological or more of you or moral view of biblical teaching, like the scientific view, um, is, am I right in construing that the idea of external happiness without suffering exists as a brilliantly thought out construct which invokes a sense of purpose and happiness. And if I am to make that conclusion, can I see those concepts in the moral psychology of the Bible as manipulative or does the defiance of natural law rule out a literal interpretation?

Speaker 2:          14:38          Okay, go back. Read that again.

Speaker 1:          14:40          So if I, if I'm to assume all of this with heaven and hell, and is it an eternal happiness is that's. Can you see that as manipulative as like

Speaker 2:          14:58          you can. I mean certainly marks did. I would say Freud did as well. One of the problem, because for the thought of a religion as, let's call it both manipulated the vim and immature because it burned people the certainty of life after death. And it allowed them the comfort of knowing that an all seeing father was watching over them. Okay. And for, I'd regard that, let's say as immature and manipulative, but he didn't have a good explanation for why people came up with the idea of hell because if you were just going to go for immature and manipulative, it might as well be all positive, right? Why put the negative in there? And you could say skeptically, well hell is where you put your enemies. But that's a really cynical interpretation because many religious people and now certainly even, but certainly throughout the Middle Ages were terrified that hell was something that they were headed to do.

Speaker 2:          15:51          Not the random is we're going to. So I don't think that that's a reasonable interpretation. Historically. I know mark's would say that the, that religion was when do whatever it could to manipulate people so that the power structure is the economic power structures can stay in place. But um, given that religion, religious structures, and this is, I would say particularly but not only true of Christianity, have played a tremendous role in giving additional voice to the people who are downtrodden and slaved. That that also was a historically that's, that's not a historic, incredible argument. Sometimes religious teachings are used to buttress the people who are in control and sometimes they're used to oppose them. So I don't mind that for a second. And then. So no, I don't think the manipulation argument is, I don't think it's a credible one. I mean, I understand it and I'm an admirer of Freud, you know, but I think he got wrong.

Speaker 2:          16:46          I think he walked out wrong and that was certainly one of the places that he disagreed most profoundly with Carla Yom and I think only came out of it right in Freud came out of it wrong. Um, and then I think the Marxist critique of religion, it's just like every other Marxist critique. It's like, yeah, yeah, you can treat religious religion, religious structures is if they're oppressive. Power structure is only, but you know, it is just a reduction of a multidimensional complexity to a, to a relatively predictable unidimensional dimensional in a dimensional phenomenon. It's not helpful. It's not unhelpful. Intellectual exercise passed its immediate self evidence, you know, because the self evidence is some religious people are corrupt. So like, yeah, right. Obviously

Speaker 1:          17:34          that, that's fair. And given the I'm taking, I'm taking one concept heaven way out of context of a huge bundle of things. So that's,

Speaker 2:          17:44          yeah, there's a writer named, um, I should tell you about this guy, Jeffrey Burton, Russell, Jeffrey Burton, Russell. You'd like him? Yeah. He's written a couple of books on heaven and a very good series on the devil as a historian. So he's a historian of the idea of heaven and the idea of the devil. So we had three volume series on the devil. What is Mephistopheles, which I think is the best one, but if you're interested in, in that kind of idea, Jeffrey Burton, Russell is a good person to, to take a look at. He's credible, credible historian. And I think his books are extremely interesting, so good. And he delves into the idea of heaven in a much more fundamental way than, than the typical. Especially the typical sort of cowardly religious critical postmodern is to always assume that there's nothing to it except power dynamics. It's foolish because having a minimum is a vision of a better future even even as even as only that.

Speaker 2:          18:49          It's by no means trivial. I mean, human beings are about the only creatures that can imagine a better future and so heaven is like the architects will better future. Yes. So you don't want to just demolish that idea too casually because we're always working. Unless we're pathological, we're always working for a better future. So. And to think of heaven is the idea that sort of shining behind that, the, you know, the, the implied tonic ideal of the idea of a better future, that's a perfectly reasonable thing to think. If you don't want to just throw it away that that'd be throwing away one of the greatest ideas of mankind. And that doesn't mean I think the people should be politically utopians. It's not the same thing.

Speaker 1:          19:28          Yes, it's the, it's the concept that, that has the psychological effects on the way people behave.

Speaker 2:          19:36          Yeah. Well, you know, it's right. And it's the concept that some value, like I think the difference between the Christian idea of having an political utopian idea of having is that for Christians having is what would be achieved through the use of truth, individual truth, and for the political utopian would be as a consequence of the instantiation of some particular political system. The same thing at all.

Speaker 1:          19:59          All right. And then we have about 10 more minutes by my time. Yep. So, uh, you answered those questions. They're really good question. Thank you. Um, I spent a long time thinking which to ask because obviously there's a million questions. You're one that the only people I've had faith in that could answer some of the questions I've had. So what do you do? Um, I, I like to think of myself as a philosopher. Socrates. I am a student. I go in and out of school. I tend to make money when I need to. Doing our jobs in green day. Like I don't have a lot of value on society. Societies.

Speaker 2:          20:40          What are your future plans?

Speaker 1:          20:43          I want to go into academia. I want to do research.

Speaker 2:          20:47          Well, you're pretty smart.

Speaker 1:          20:48          You know, that's a good plan. Those are good questions. Um, I, it's school is expensive in the types of schools that I, I go to were kind of boring. I like if I could go to your class every day, I would be the happiest person ever. Um, but the, the type of teachers, not that they're not intelligent, they're just not a Sam Harris or Neil degrasse Tyson or a Jordan Peterson. I spent a lot of time reading, reading through Einstein over and over again, reading through our, listening to Neil degrasse Tyson. I liked learning. I just, the university doesn't give me, um, substantial means of learning. I don't feel like I learned much.

Speaker 2:          21:31          I get the picture. I get the picture. It's a problem that you've got is that there's some utility in credentials. So you know, there's always the possibility of going to university for the credentials and educating yourself at the same time what you really have to do if you go to university anyways. I know it's a, but you know, it's always an uncomfortable meld between what you want and what should be and what you can get.

Speaker 1:          21:57          Yes. Mark Twain says, I never let my schooling interfere with my education.

Speaker 2:          22:01          Well, right. Yes, exactly. That's perfect. Yes.

Speaker 1:          22:04          So that's what I'm doing. I have a couple of semesters left. Uh, the problem is I don't know. I, I have a couple of semesters left. I go to the University of Michigan. The problem is my motivation, um, which I've watched a lot of the videos on your motivation. I can't find the motivation to do the work if I was at Harvard or Princeton or Yale or somewhere where I was challenged, where I would be like, this is a huge opportunity for me.

Speaker 2:          22:29          I'm going to build the judge for yourself somehow. Have you done the future? The what program? Future authoring program?

Speaker 1:          22:38          Um, I, I have done that. Yes. I think I was too focused subconsciously with the reasons why it would help, um, determining why, why this would help me. It's helping me because of this is helping me because of that in kind of like playing mind games with myself, making it so it didn't really help me as much.

Speaker 2:          23:03          Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, because you know, the fact is, given, given your level of, let's say again to you, you would have to have a pretty good goal to, to know it's not atypical for someone to be very smart and very open, but not very conscientious. And I don't know if you're not very conscientious, maybe you are, but what you said so far suggests that you're higher in openness and lowering conscientiousness. What, what you need to rectify that if you're, if you can rectify it, is this suitably lofty goal and so, and, but, but if you didn't do the future authoring program in a manner that helped you establish that goal, it probably isn't going to help you. Like, do you obviously need to reason and fair enough, you know.

Speaker 1:          23:48          So I guess my goal would to be going to Grad school at an Ivy League college. I would. Cool. And I'll have to. I mean, at one point I, uh, I wrote a letter to like basically everybody that works at the Harvard admissions, my finding the, uh, the, uh, the emails and, and like sent a letter explaining my situation, my family situation. Why I didn't get good grades in high school, why I've never been on a typical good student, but I have a large drive and motivation to learn and I know every single professor at Harvard and I'm familiar with their work. I've read their abstracts in their, uh, in their journals. Not every single one, maybe exaggerating, but I'm very familiar and with Yale too. And why did they go into linguistics and I never got a response back and I kind of just sunk back into my, my read and ignore the, uh, the universe type of thing, but they definitely where I need to set a goal and not sink back into my behavior like central drift, but actually go towards that goal.

Speaker 2:          24:59          Yep. Well, you know, you have a good goal to go to Grad who are incredible graduate school and to pursue an academic career as a good goal, but you also might want to really think hard about what the hell you're going to do if that doesn't happen because you know, you're kind of built for it. So it'd be a good pursuit. And you know, you sound like the kind of guy who could use a phd so. Well, your questions were smart, you know, I had to listen to them heart and you thought about them a lot and they were sophisticated, so, um, you know, and that puts you in the top one percent of students, probably something like that, something like that, one to five percent. And so you've got the right kind of mind for it. And with a mind like that, you also really want to get yourself disciplined because, um, it's also safer if you have a mind like yours to get disciplined because the problem with a mind like yours isn't, it'll, it'll, it'll, uh, you'll be chasing it everywhere. Like someone with annealed a badly trained bloodhound.

Speaker 1:          26:03          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          26:04          Yeah. And that's, that can be really hard on a person over time, you know, because it's easy to be one of those people that has a tremendous amount of potential but doesn't have it realized and why that's a rough life by the time you're about 40.

Speaker 1:          26:16          Yes. I'm also, what is a linguistically defined as a polymath where academia is one interest that I'm showing you right now because you're an academic, but I have a wide variety of interests like music, art.

Speaker 2:          26:34          Yeah. Well that's, that's where my thinking fitness

Speaker 1:          26:39          is high. So I do have other opportunity, you know, childish Donald Glover, he is a, he's a rapper and I'm a standup comedian and he's writing deadpool. He's done. Yes. He's very, very identify a lot with him looking at him as a role model. He does a lot of different things and he were, I don't know, his, the profanity in his work makes it discredits his talent by a lot of people. But like so did, um, Shakespeare, I mean basically what the things he says is witty and punny and a pro, a profane of course, but so is Shakespeare, you know, for the time. But I identify a lot with him.

Speaker 3:          27:33          Well, I'm afraid I have to bring on someone else's right up here, but.
