Speaker 1:          00:05          Heavy emphasis on dealing with future, you mentioned that the program effects are much more pronounced than men specifically on the western to imagery and imagery and visual spatial abilities related. And if so, given that men on average have greater visual visual spatial ability because this account for the gender difference in the program's efficacy.

Speaker 2:          00:34          That's a lot of questions. They're good questions. Um, I'll tell you a couple of strange things that it takes that I don't really understand. The first is when we've done the analysis of the effects of the future authoring program, it has had a different differential impact on men and it's had a particularly differential impact on what I would call it excluded men. And so that would be non western ethic minority men or, or what majority of men who aren't doing very well. So for example, at Mohawk College, the future authoring program had a particularly robust effect on Mohawk college students who are men who hadn't done very well in high school and knew, hadn't picked a major that had a destination, a career destination edits. And so you can imagine those people are, they have an ambiguous relationship with the idea of education and they're not oriented specifically towards a goal.

Speaker 2:          01:27          They're not very motivated. Now why did it have a differential effect on men now? That's a good question. Well, first of all, the women are doing better, so it might just be a matter of the fact that it does better for people who aren't doing as well. And at the moment, most of them are men, I don't believe. I think that might be part of it, but I don't believe that's all of it. I think that part of the reason that women are doing better is because they're agreeable. And so if a system sets out a structure and says, here's a pathway to attainment, the women won't rebel against that. They'll go along with it. And that's working very well for them at the moment. The man, especially the men on the disagreeable end of the distribution and there's way more men on the district disagreeable end of the distribution.

Speaker 2:          02:10          Then there are women, right? That's what you get from. If you look at overlapping normal distributions. So there's the male district, female distribution for agreeableness, mail distribution for agreeableness. Tremendous overlap. Okay. Women are higher, all the really agreeable people are women. All the really disagreeable people are meant and maybe the real differences occur at the extremes, right? So, so, and it's, it's a very interesting side effect of overlapping distributions so that people can be mostly the same, but that can still produce radical differences. Disagreeable men won't do anything they don't want to do. They just say up yours, I'll go home and play video games with you. I'm not listening to your stupid classes and why should I work for you? I'll just go have fun. I'll do my own thing. I don't think they're motivated. And so then if you take the men who are like that and you say, okay, what do you want?

Speaker 2:          03:04          You can have what you want, but you have figured out what it is. So then they write down what they want and they think, oh hey, well that might be worth having. So maybe I'll put some effort into it. That's what it looks like to me. Now, you know that's weak evidence and this is a weak argument, but I'm trying to stretch out my understanding to account for this, but I'll tell you something else that's really weird. I don't understand this either. So more than 90 percent of the people who watch my videos on youtube are men. Now. That's weird because now about 80 percent of psychology students are women, so that is not what you would expect, right? You would expect that the majority of them would be women and you might say, well, it's because of the political stance I've taken and I thought, well that's possible.

Speaker 2:          03:43          So I went and looked at the demographic data because I have that. Well before I did any of the political videos, 85 percent of my viewers were men, so it's actually increased a bit. It's increased by six percent and that's not trivial, but it was still overwhelmingly men. So that was interesting. I thought, what the hell? Why is that? Exactly? And then now I've been watching crowds when I've been talking to them and the crowds that have come to see me in person. This happened at the University of Toronto Free Speech Debate and I actually noticed it and commented on it before the debate took place because I was talking about intrinsic differences between men and women and I looked around the room and I thought, hmm, hey, 80 percent of the people in this room are men. So I had all the men, women and women stand up and then all the men stand up.

Speaker 2:          04:26          I said, look like here's a natural experiment. For some reason, 80 percent of the people who showed up to this are men now. Everybody thought I was kinda cracked to to do that. And it was a risk, you know? And, and I, but I thought, no, there's something going on here. And then what's interesting now is that every public appearance that I've made that's related to the sort of topics that we're discussing is overwhelmingly men. It's like, it's like 85 to 90 percent. And so I thought, wow, that's weird. Like what the Hell's going on here? Exactly. And then the other thing I've noticed is that I've been talking a lot to the crowds that I've been talking to, not about rights, but about responsibility, right? Because he can't have the bloody converse. What are you doing? You can't have the conversation about rights without the conversation about responsibility because your rights are my responsibility.

Speaker 2:          05:13          That's what they are technically. So you just can't have only half of that discussion and we're only having half that discussion. The question is, well, what the hell are you leaving out? If you only have that half of the discussion and the answer is, well, you're leaving out responsibility and then the question is, well, what are you leaving out? If you're leaving out responsibility? And the answer might be, well maybe you're leaving out the meaning of life. That's what it looks like to me. It's like here you are suffering away. What makes it worthwhile? Rights. You know you're completely, oh, you're completely. You have no idea what you're you. It's almost impossible to describe how bad an idea that is. Responsibility. That's what gives life meaning. It's like lift alone. Then you can tolerate yourself, right? Because look at your useless, easily hurt, easily killed. Why should you have any self respect?

Speaker 2:          06:11          That's the story of the fall. Pick something up and carry it. Pick. Make it heavy enough so that you can think, yeah, well useless as I am. At least I could move that from there to there. Well, what's really cool about that is that when I talked to these crowds about this, the man's eyes light up and that's very like I've seen that phenomena because I've been talking about this mythological material for a long time and I can see when I'm watching crowds, people you know their eyebrows lift, their eyes light up because I put something together for them, not sweat, mythological stories do, so I'm not taking responsibility for that. That's what the story's due. So I save this story. People go click, click, click. You know when their eyes light up, but this responsibility thing that's a whole new order of this is that young men are so hungry for that.

Speaker 2:          06:54          It is unbelievable. And one of the things I've been talking to some of the people who've been running for the conservative leadership in Canada and I've been talking to them about if the difficulties they have communicating with young people because conservatives, what, what the hell are they going to sell to young people, right? Because being conservative is something that happens when you're older. They can sell responsibility. No one's selling it. And the thing is for men, there's nothing but responsibility. No, I was watching the simpsons the other day. I watched the first simpsons episode and I deconstructed it. And so it's really interesting. So what happens in the first Simpson episode is that it's Christmas and homer and marge, you're going to buy some Christmas presents, but homer doesn't get his Christmas bonus. And so it was absolutely crushed by that. And that actually is a recurring theme in the simpsons where homer loses his job or something like that, or count night, make enough money.

Speaker 2:          07:45          He's completely crushed even though he's kind of useless, bumbling, laughing, fool of a guy, you know? The thing that gives that show his soul is that he still oriented towards his family. That's what makes them vulnerable, is that foolish as he is. He's decided to adopt responsibility for his family and to try to bear that and so he's not. He's a holy fool. He's not a complete fool and so interesting watching the story because he suffers dreadfully as a consequence of not being able to fulfill his responsibility. Well, that's for men. Women have their sets of responsibilities. They're not the same. Right? Because then they're complicated because women of course have to take primary responsibility for for having infants at least, but then also for caring for them, they're. They're structured differently than men per biological necessity, even if it's not a psychological issue and it's also partly a psychological issue.

Speaker 2:          08:37          Women know what they have to do. Men have to figure out what they have to do and if they have nothing worth living for them, they stay Peter Pan and why the hell not because the alternative to valued responsibility is impulsive, low class pleasure, and you saw that independent Akio story, right? That's pleasure island. It's like, well, why lift the load if there's nothing in it for you? That's another thing that we're doing to men. That's a very bad idea, and two boys, it's like your pathological and oppressive. It's like, fine. Then why the hell am I going to play if that's the. If that's the situation, if I get no credit for bearing responsibility, can bloody well be sure I'm not going to bear it, but then you know your life is useless and meaningless and you have. You're not, you're full of self contempt, denialism and, and that's not good. And so that's why I think that's what I think's going on at a deeper level with regards to men needing this direction. A man has to decide that he's going to do something. He has to decide that.

Speaker 2:          09:50          Yeah, well, you know partly what you're trying to do in the future authoring process to say, okay, well what's your highest value? Right? It's the star. It's like, okay, what are you aiming for? You can decide man, but you know, there some criteria. It should be good for you. It should be good for you in a way that facilitates your moving forward. Maybe it should be good for you in a way that's also good for the family and the community. It should cover the the domain of life. I mean there's constraints on what you should regard as a value, but you. But within those constraints, you have the choice. You have choice. Well, the thing is is that people will carry a heavy load if they get to pick the god damn load so and they think, well I won't carry any load. It's like, okay, fine, but then you're like the sled dog that doesn't have a sled.

Speaker 2:          10:37          Depaul, you're just gonna. You're going to tear a piece is out of your own legs because you're bored. You know you need. People are pack animals. They need, they need to pull against a weight and and that's not true for everyone. It's not true particularly say for low conscientious people. I mean maybe they're open and creative are extroverted and some other things, but for the, for the typical person, they, they, they'll eat themselves, they'll eat themselves up unless they have a load. This is why there's such an opiod epidemic among a dispossessed white, middle aged guys who were unemployed in the US. It's like they lose their job. They're done right? They despise themselves. They develop chronic pain syndromes and depression and the chronic pain is treated with opiates. It's like that's what we're doing. So yeah, that's what it looks like to me is you have to.

Speaker 2:          11:27          And it's so interesting to watch the young man when you talk to them about responsibility. There is a God damn thrilled about it. It just blows me away. It's like, really? That's what's. That's the counterculture. Grow the hell up and do something useful. Really. I could do that. Oh, I'm so excited by that idea. No one ever mentioned that before. It's like rights, rights, rights, rights, Jesus. It's, it's, it's appalling. It's, it's, and, and I feel that that's deeply felt by the people who are, who are coming out to, to listen to these sorts of things, to there. They've had enough of that so. And they better have because it's a non productive mode of being responsibility, man. That's where the meaning in life is. So all right, good. One more class. Hey, we'll see you next week.
