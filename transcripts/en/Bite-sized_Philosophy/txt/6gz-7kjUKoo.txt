Speaker 1:          00:00          It's the beginning of the lecture, but how do, how does morality from

Speaker 2:          00:08          stronger and weaker to what's good and what is it? Well, I think it depends to some degree on what you mean by stronger. So physical strength is one element and like if you look at mythological heroes, imagine that the stories of heroes are fragmented elements of, uh, of the archetype. And so one kind of archetypal hero obviously as someone who's physically strong, you know, you see that there's a great movie that you could watch about this. It's called Hitman Hart. It's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen and it's about this guy named Bret Harte. Bret Harte was for awhile, the most famous Canadian on the planet, and he was a worldwide wrestling foundation, I think. What did they call that? Wwf? Yeah, he was there, like lead good guy. And so he and wrestling, I love the documentary because when I was a little kid, like four or five, I used to watch his father whose name was Stu Hart, who ran this channel, this wrestling confederation in Alberta.

Speaker 2:          01:10          And Stu Hart had I think eight boys and he trained all of them to be pro wrestlers and part of the movie is extraordinarily funny because Stu Hart is in it and he's really old. He's like 85 and he's just barely. Can you imagine? He was like a pro wrestler for 40 years, like every joint is broken and he still big but he's just barely moving and this is this kid and another kid come over and I'm. Stu is telling the story about how it used to take his boys into the basement and toughen them up. And I think Brett called that the journey to pain or something like that. His father would take all these kids down there and wrestle with them and push them right to the edge of their pain tolerance constantly. And so. And anyways, they grew up tough. There's no doubt about that.

Speaker 2:          01:53          And all his daughters married pro wrestlers to. And I think he had seven daughters. So he's quite the character anyways. These two kids, they're like their late adolescence, early adulthood come over and one of them's pretty damn cocky and he's listening to Stewart. He says something smart like, well, you know, you were pretty, you were pretty tough with the old days. Hey, and stew looks at them and says, well, why? Why don't you come down to the basement with me? And he says, look, I don't want to hurt you old man. And so, so they're filmmakers follow them into the basement day and like they're kind of standing there and the old guy grabs him in a headlock. It takes him like, he's like a snake, a, he's got her in a headlock like so fast that the kid doesn't know what to do. And then. So stew, like, who knows how to put a headlock on someone.

Speaker 2:          02:38          He's flexing his, his uh, his uh, his, his forearm. Yeah. Which is still not so bad. A forearm and he's got this guy's face is just, he's just, he's like, he's stepped in a bear trap. Plus he's absolutely shocked that this old guy got him. And so he's kind of gasping and stu says something like, you watch, if I flex this just right, and you can see this vein on his forehead start to pop out. It's extraordinarily funny. Anyways, Bret Hart plays out the good guy archetype and Brett's like, he's a solid guy, but he's, I would say he's not particularly sophisticated and I'm not being cruel about that. I mean he had a great career and he's tough as a boot and so good for him, but he plays out this, this good guy archetype and he gets tangled up in it. And now I don't remember your damn question, but I am trying to answer it. Tell me the question again.

Speaker 2:          03:36          Oh yes, yes. Okay. Exactly. Well, so one of the things I really liked about this movie was it showed me why people watched wrestling and I couldn't, I couldn't because certainly they're not appealing and I'm not being. There are different strata of conception of abstraction that any entertainment process has to appeal to. And you know, most people don't go to movies and that's actually because it really is because movies operate at a level of sophistication that are too high, that is too high for many people just like novels. I mean hardly anyone reads, you know, and if you about 15 percent of the population might be 20 percent cannot read well enough to follow written instructions and so and, and they and people who are, maybe it's 15 percent of the population or 10 percent have never finished a book, never. And so, and it is that high, but, but you still, you're still, the archetypes still needs to manifest itself at different levels and so it manifests itself in wrestling, but even there where it is physical force, it's not just physical force, like it's a drama between good and evil and you can see this so clearly and in the Bret Hart documentary, because he's the good guy and you know, the bad guys are really over the top bad.

Speaker 2:          04:49          It's a real drama. It's like it's good versus evil in the rain every time. And hopefully good winds but good often gets, you know, maybe the bad wrestler brings two of his friends in and they bring in chairs and they bashed the hell out of the good guy. And the whole audience is just outraged by this. And and the documentary does a lovely job of showing that, but so even at the level of physical combat, let's say you can't reduce what's good to what strong is just one element of it better to be strong than to be weak and so you can have a strong hero because it's better to be strong than to be weak, but it's better to be strong and kind than to be strong and it's better to be strong and kind and wise than to be strong and kind and so.

Speaker 2:          05:32          And that's true not only for human beings but it's even true, let's say at the wolf for the chimpanzee level because one of the things you see with the chimp dominance hierarchies if, and I think I mentioned this before, is if the leader, the dominant male is really good at fostering social relations and being reciprocal in acts like grooming and also paying attention to the females and their offspring. His dynasty will be much more stable and so strong might be good for one battle. It might be good for two battles, but for 50 battles it's not optimized. Especially because no law, no matter how strong you are, someone can take you out, so, so what happens is the idea of what's ideal becomes increasingly complex across time, multifaceted, right, and so strength, wisdom, intelligence, vision, all these things are amalgamated into a single ba and we'll talk a lot about that because I want to show you how that happened in Mesopotamia because that's one of the first places where we have documentation about how that ideally merged.

Speaker 2:          06:35          They have a god called Marduk and Martin had 50 names and as far as I can tell, the reason for that was that mark was an amalgam of the tribal Dante's of at least 50 tribes and and when the within tribes were brought together and civilized, each of their gods who were ideals had to be amalgamated into something that was a single, a single dramatized representation of value. Or there was no way that all those people could have lived together. Right? There are different value structures would have fragmented them and they would have stayed in a state of war. And so the question is, what's the question you're asking? If it's not strength than what is it? Well, it's strength is an element, but the Egyptians figured out that it was. Vision is actually the capacity to pay attention. That was paramount and the Mesopotamians have that figured out more or less too, because they're god. Marduk had eyes all the way around his head. He could see everywhere. So seeing was a critical element of what should be on top. And the other thing for the Mesopotamians was the ability to speak. So by the time of Mesopotamia, people that already dramatized the idea that the cardinal human attributes, our vision and the ability to speak so and not be the ability to speak the truth, to not just speak so.
