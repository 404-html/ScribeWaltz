Speaker 1:          00:00          In some ways it's the women that are embracing the masculine archetype in some ways that are being successful. I mean they're. They're being extraordinarily responsible and they're. They're feeling a lot of these positions quicker than men can. I mean they're and they're graduating at higher rates of college and they're declining. They're declining motherhood or they're at least suspending it throughout the west, which is you could argue for either ways. There's reasons for that, but I guess my question is, well, I think that the expression of the masculine spirit in women isn't denigrated, like women don't get accused of contributing to the patriarchy even when they take positions in society that you would think are fully patriarchal now and which is a strange thing. So women who go to law school and then and then practice as corporate lawyers say, aren't subject to the same. What would you call it?

Speaker 1:          00:46          Claim that their activity is facilitating that. The decline of the planet. I guess because they're seen as well, they're there because of their gender. I suppose they're seen as as as leaders of the rebellion against the patriarchal spirit. Even though structurally it boils down to the same thing, sure, so that masculine, classically masculine, symbolically masculine, yearning for hierarchical productivity and competition is rewarded in women but not in men and which is also a very perverse thing because it doesn't make any sense. It makes sense through the postmodernists view, which is they're just undoing the oppressor ship of the man and the last one, hundred 50 years. So the ends justify the means. That's the way they look at it. Whatever power women can take from men is a good thing. That's the way they look at it. Well, there's a funny thing about that too, that like I, I read this in 12 rules for life.

Speaker 1:          01:42          I was looking at some of the Pew Research Data and I don't remember the figures precisely, but over the last 15 years, the percentage of women who young women who claim that they would like to be married in a permanent relationship has gone up a substantial amount. I don't remember what it was, a 50 percent approximately springs to mind, but a lot at the same time. It's declined almost the same degree among young men and so what's. What's perverse about this, this is something I've talked to my daughter a fair a bit about is that I mean if you ask young women what they want, I don't know if they can answer because I don't know if they know if they're 19 or 20 because I think their heads are so muddled by what they've been told that they don't really know, but my sense is that women want the opportunity to develop their career in whatever direction they see fit and fair enough, but they want an intimate relationship and usually a monogamous one that's permanent and they want to have the opportunity to have kids and what you see happening.

Speaker 1:          02:42          Inevitably, and I believe this to be the case. I've watched very carefully as I've, as I've grown up and got older because I've worked with women my whole life, is that women are less, are less compelled by their career as they approach their thirties and more compelled by the desire to have a permanent relationship and biological too. I would argue to. No, I mean, I, I, I think it's, it's a biological necessity because women have to have children relatively young. That's correct. But it's interesting to watch it phenomenologically and even the women that I've seen who've had very high powered careers is that as they move into their, especially their early thirties, they start to realize that the career is a pretty one dimensional enterprise, even if it's a good career, because even good careers are still jobs and good careers. They're also very hard jobs.

Speaker 1:          03:33          They're like 70 hour a week jobs and they're full bore commitment jobs and to figure out how to have a career like that and to have a life, to have a family, to have an intimate relationship, to have children and then to also be able to take care of them. That's a very complex, um, that's a very complex job to manage. And so what's strange is, I think what's strange is that the very things that the radicals are undermining the monogamous family are actually those things that women most want, especially as they approach their thirties. And so this is a catastrophe on both ends of the, of the gender distribution.
