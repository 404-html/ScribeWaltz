Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, Louis Ck, a while back talked about Tiger Woods, which I really liked it because people were complaining about Tiger Woods in his affairs. Yeah. And also about our Arnold Schwarzenegger in his affairs. And um, and one of the things that Louis Ck pointed out quite in a very comical manner was that, well many men aren't having the affairs of Tiger Woods, but that's not because they're good man. It's because they don't have, I think he said, a busload of Swedish Swedish bikini models waiting for them at the final hole. So the idea would be that you should conduct yourself so that you are attractive to many women. Maybe that you have your pick of the, but then you should pick one. And that's a sacrifice. Obviously that's a sacrifice of a sort. It's a strange sacrifice because, you know, I, I talked to someone, a comedian recently who told me of one of his experiences in Las Vegas.

Speaker 1:          01:04          So he went to Las Vegas with a sports superstar and they went to a party. And what literally happened at the party was one woman brought forward a small group of other women. All very attractive and basically told the sports legend that he could just pick one of them and she would go home with them. Right? And so that had all been arranged beforehand and he said that he's been in many situations where something like that has happened and I thought, well, you know, that sort of is appealing to the Hugh hefner playboy, 14 year old fantasy that sort of gripped our culture from the 19 sixties onward. But imagine that you sleep casually with 100 women in, in, in a six month period or three month period for that matter, or a three week period. I don't care. Pick your timeframe and you say, well, what?

Speaker 1:          01:58          What? You're, you're, you're ecstatic with yourself because you've been validated by this opportunity and I'm not making light of that. It's not nothing to be attractive to women like that. It's really something to be attractive to women like that, but it isn't obvious to me that your choice to conduct yourself in that manner enriches your life and the life of other people more in any way than picking one person and actually having a relationship with them. It's only true that that promiscuous pathway, let's say is better if you can actually divorce sexuality from all the other elements of life, say well, it's about variety and it's about impulsive pleasure or maybe it could be even slightly deeper than merely impulsive pleasure. It can be shared, impulsive, pleasure, but I don't think you can do that because sexuality isn't divorced from family and from morality and from all the other elements.

Speaker 1:          02:59          Your life and if you're a mature, you know that and so you make a decision. You make a decision not to capitalize on your opportunity, not to misuse your opportunities and you know, a huge part of the me too phenomenon. A huge part of this battle that's being played out in our culture is a consequence of the failure of men to recognize that now it's not only the failure of men. Let me be absolutely clear about that because for example, with the example of the sports superstar, the women who are lining up in front of him, parading themselves and offering themselves are deeply complicit in, in this pathological game. And so it's pretty clear anthropologically as well that, you know, sexual choice tends towards a prieto distribution, especially for men. So most men have very little selection at their disposal disposal and a small number of men have excess opportunities.

Speaker 1:          04:00          The question is what should that small number of men do? And you might say capitalize on it and to hell with the consequences. And like it's a powerful argument, but I do believe it's wrong. It destabilizes the society. And so, and I also don't think it does your soul any good because the problem with treating other people as casual sexual partners, let's say, is that you also treat yourself that way simultaneously. And I don't think that that does you any good because you're not. Unless that's what you want to be. If you want to be a casual partner, it's like, wow, that's. I wouldn't say that's a particularly noble ambition. You should be able to do better than that.
