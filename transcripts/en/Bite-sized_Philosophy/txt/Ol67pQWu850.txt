Speaker 1:          00:00          To navigate, there's two things you need to know when the first is where the hell are you exactly, precisely right. Razor Sharp, what's good about you and what's bad about you by your own buy your own reckoning. You don't have to. You can ask other people, but this is a game you play yourself. It's like as far as I'm concerned, I'm taking star. What is it that's okay about being what needs some work and you've got to watch to not be too self critical when you're doing that too, because that can just be another kind of flaw and then the next is, okay, well where are you going? What's your destination? Well, and that's what the frame is. Now you know you could do that in a very sophisticated way and you do that by thinking consciously about who it is that you are in an articulated manner and where you want to go and why and how you're going to get there, and people hardly ever do that.

Speaker 1:          00:48          That is, that's come as such an absolute shock to me as an educator. I just, because one of the other programs, I use this in my classes, what are the other programs in this suite of programs is called the future authoring program and I started developing my maps of meaning class, which is where some of this materials from andI got students to write about their past. It's like, okay, we're, we're talking about stories, so let's tell your story. Who are you, how'd you get here, and what are you now. That usually helps people put things to rest. Although it's quite stressful. Well, you're doing it. Stress goes up when you're doing it and maybe you feel miserable for a couple of weeks and then stress goes down and it stays down. So that's. And that's also why people don't do it because who the hell wants to have their stress go up?

Speaker 1:          01:34          But if it's temporary, it's a sacrifice. So then the next issue is, well, where are you going? And one of the things that, and this I just still, I cannot understand you. Students that had been in education system for 15 years, 14 years, high end students. Most of them, not once in their whole bloody life. Did anyone ever get them to sit down for like a day and say, all right, justify your existence. Like plus. Seriously. It's like, here you are in university. You're taking a bunch of courses, you've got some sort of vague career plan. It's like defending the damn thing a bit since you're going to go live it and everything. You're staking everything on it. It's like, what's your damn plan and why are you so convinced that it's not the plan of a babbling fool because if you haven't thought about it, it is and if you really want to go out there and live that out, you know one of the things Carl Jung said was that you, you're in a story whether you know it or not, and then he made two nice comments about that.

Speaker 1:          02:37          If it's someone else's story, you're probably going to get a bit part and it might not be the one you want, and if it's a story that you don't know, it might be one with a really bad ending or maybe it's just bad period with a worse ending, and if you don't know what the story that you're living out is, maybe that's the one you know. Maybe you got that from your mother. You got it from your grandmother, you got it from your or God only knows where you picked it up because you pick up things like mad because that's what human beings are like. So maybe you're living a malevolent tragedy unconsciously and then one thing you might ask yourself is, well, how wretched and miserable is your life? That said, few title to that, how wretched, miserable and futile is your life. And you might say, well, 70 percent on each count.

Speaker 1:          03:21          It's like, then you're probably unconsciously living out a malevolent tragedy and maybe that's not for the best. Oh, it's either that or the whole universe hates you, right? Or 70 percent hates you, you know, so. So anyways, you know, we got students to start writing in detail about not what they wanted. It's not a career thing because that's the closest people usually get is they have a career plan. It's like, no, no, it's not a career plan. That's, that's peripheral important. But peripheral, it's like, all right, you got three years, man, you're going to live them anyways. Devote those three years to setting the world up around you so that it's the best it can possibly be for you as if you were taking care of yourself as if you cared for yourself. But what would that look like? You know, let's say just for the sake of argument, if you figured out where you were that you could have, what would be best for you?

Speaker 1:          04:19          Well, what is that? I bet you never asked. People don't ask and so life comes out them like random snakes and they sort of fend them off and life goes by and things don't work out the way people expected them to. But a huge part of that is they didn't know where they were because they wouldn't look or didn't know that they should look ignorance and willful blindness, right to great catastrophes, and they never figured out where they wanted it to go or why. Now there's a problem with figuring out where you want to go. And the problem is is that you make your conditions for failure clear to yourself and people don't like that. So if you keep yourself in the fog, then you can't tell when you screwed up. Now that isn't so good because you're still screwing up. You're just to blind self blind to notice.

Speaker 1:          05:10          Although in in, in the short term that's less painful. If you make your criteria for success are razor sharp, then you know every time you screw up. But that's great because then you could fix it. You can either repair the, the, the behavioral inadequacy or that conceptual inadequacy that you're using as a tool in that situation. Or maybe you could adjust your damn plan either way you can fix it. And so, okay, so you're living in one of these bloody things and you might as well, it seems to me you might as well make it the best one you could live in because you don't have anything better to do. Now, if you don't do that, if you don't do it consciously, and this is what the psychoanalyst pointed out is that you have innumerable quasi autonomous subsystems that make you up, that will generate stories impulsively and you'll just act them out.

Speaker 1:          06:06          And you know that because you watch yourself over two weeks and you think, Jesus, I did a lot of stupid things in the last two weeks. And you think, why? And it's because you're a random. You're a collection of somewhat random, quasi autonomous personality units and lacking a leader. They're just going to fire off whenever they want. You know, first you're hungry, then you're thirsty. Then you want to go to bed with your wife, you know, then you want to sleep in and you want to tell your boss off. Then you want to curse at the guy that cuts you off in traffic. It's like you're kind of like a two year old, you know, just it's one emotional frame after another vying for dominance. There's no overarching hierarchy and there's no king at the top.
