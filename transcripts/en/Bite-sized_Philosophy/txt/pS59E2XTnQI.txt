Speaker 1:          00:00          This is really an interesting one, I think. I mean, so I don't know what God's doing here exactly, but he's helping ignite the sacrificial flame and that's kind of an interesting idea I think because you know, let's say that you have an impulse to make a sacrifice. You think, well, I should change this about my life. What? What's like? Where does that come from? That impulse is just, well just manifests itself out of nothing. So what order you came up with it, well, you might want to start thinking about that thinking so surely that you come up with your own thoughts. You don't come up with your damn dreams. Do you pay just happened and God only knows where they come from. They come from your brain. Whoa boy, that's a sophisticated answer that come from your unconscious. Well, that's not much better. At least it's somewhat better, but there are those matt, amazing dramas take place in the theater of your imagination at night. You don't even understand what they are and yet they occur night after night and those things, dreams, they can contain wisdom that it just. Well, it just staggers the person who has the dream. Once they get the key to the dream, once they remembered, it's like, oh look, you just revealed a bunch of wisdom to yourself that you didn't know what. Where'd that come from? Well, you don't know. How in the world can you dream up things that you don't know? That's a tough one. Maybe we'll talk about that at some point in this lecture series because there are some reasonable things that can be said about that, but you know the idea of that

Speaker 1:          01:31          there's something that's not you young would call it the self. Carl Jung would call it the self, which he thought of it as the totality of your being across time and space. It's something like that and that you know each second that you exist is a slice of the self manifesting itself across time and space, and he thought of the. The self is partly the voice of conscience. Whatever that is that helps guide you when you have to make a difficult decision and a difficult decision might be, well, what do I need to sacrifice? What is, how do I need to discipline myself, right? What do I need to forego? Well, how do you figure those things out? Well, you know, we'll just picture is trying to put forth the idea that perhaps if you had established the proper relationship with God the father and we've talked about what that might mean, then he would help figure out how to get this sacrificial fires burning so that you could stay in a proper relationship with him across time. Well, if that's such an unreasonable proposition, it. What's the alternative proposition? Well, this isn't working out very well, that's for sure. You know, Kate seems to be doing it. I don't know what it is. It's like he says, if he thinks he can only do it himself or maybe he wants only to take credit for it or something like that, he's not in this

Speaker 1:          02:48          grateful, let's say, and inquiring grateful and inquiring posture because that's what a prayer for posture should be. It should be grateful and inquiring and grateful is, thank God things aren't worse for me than they are and you should be grateful about that because they could be a lot worse than they are and they can be so bad and inquiring would be, well, I don't really know how I could make it better, but I'm. I'm open to suggestions, man, if I can figure out how to do it all, try it. That's the. That's the humility and the inquiry. That's a humble inquiry. How could I make things better? It's something like that and that's what sacrifices do I need to make in order to make things better. That's a good question to ask yourself. You could ask yourself that every morning, what sacrifice do I have to make to make things better?

Speaker 1:          03:38          You can decide what constitutes better. How about that? Then it's not even as if it's being imposed on you. Come up with your own notion of what constitutes better. Try to make it sophisticated. Should just be better for you because that isn't going to work very well. Right? You're. You're just gonna fall downstairs. If you do that because you have to live with other people and besides stupid anyways, what are you going to do like can't even just nothing you could even say about that. It's so that that's the. That's the attitude of a very badly behaved hyper aggressive two year old and I mean that technically and so you could. You could ask yourself, well, how I have this day that lays itself out in front of me? What thing could I let go of that's impeding my progress that if I let go of would make my life better, my family's life better, my culture's life better, my being better, and then that would give you something to do for the day, wouldn't it?

Speaker 1:          04:36          Into a justify your miserable life because you need that. That's the whole point of the first story of Adam and eve. What do you have? A miserable life? Okay, what am I going to do about that? Well, if you just have a miserable life, you're just going to suffer stupidly and get bitter about it. That's what happened is to cane. It's like, well, how about not doing that? Because that seems to just take a bad deal and make it worse. How about making a sacrifice and seeing if you can please God and put being on track? God, that'd be something to do. What could be better than that? What could possibly be better than that? Well, that's why it's archetipal band because nothing's better than that. That's where tops out. So when you can do that, you could do that every day. You'd have to do it in a little way because like what good are you? You know you're not going to go and bring this socialist utopia in to being in one fell swoop. You might also think that one of the things came might figure out here. There's a couple of things that just aren't going right for him, downwind of the fire, not the right place to blow from and the fact that he's in hidden valley in Hays and smoke and breathing it in and the fire isn't burning. Might be an indication that he's doing something wrong or he could be wiping his eyes and say, Jesus, what kind of stupid bloody universe would produce smoke like this? It's like, yes, well that's the more likely outcome,

Speaker 1:          06:22          and the Lord said unto Cain, why Art Thou wroth and why is they countenance fallen? If Thou knewest well Shalt Thou not be accepted? Now that's an interesting line because, and I've looked at a variety of different translations of. This is seventh verse here, like a bunch of them, because the translation for that, that's a critical line and the translation really matters and so I'll tell you what I think the story is what I've been able to figure out, and I'm sure I haven't got it completely right, but it's so he asks, God says to him, if you do well, won't you be accepted? What does the hint there? Right? It's something like, well, things aren't going so well for you, so the first thing you might think is

Speaker 1:          07:11          you're not doing well. What does that mean? You're not doing good? Does that mean you're not acting properly means it's the hint because God is suggesting that if you are doing it properly, you would be successful. I had a friend at one point who was a very bitter person and he had a bunch of problems and some of them were self inflicted in some of them were fate, I suppose that he had. He was, he had become very, very destructive, murderously, destructive, genocidally destructive. I would say. You could see it in his dreams and, and he lived with me for awhile and I knew him very well. He was a friend of mine from the time I was 12 until the time he committed suicide when he was about 40 and a

Speaker 1:          07:59          when he lived with me. I was trying to help him get on his feet, which was why he had come to live with me because he thought maybe I could help him get on his feet and he could only take relatively low level jobs. You know, like he had some mechanical ability, didn't, he didn't get educated. Although he's a very, very smart person. He probably had an Iq of about 135 or something like that. He's very smart and so he was bitter too because he hadn't educated themselves to the level that his, you know, his intellectual, abandoned. So we had to take jobs that were beneath him intellectually and he had a, he had that real intellectual arrogance, you know, because he was smart and really smart people often come to believe that only smart matters and if they're smart and all that and all it matters is smart and then the world isn't sort of laying itself at their feet than they've been terribly betrayed and, and then they cling to their intelligence, which is more like a talent or a gift.

Speaker 1:          08:50          Like it's a, like it's an idol, you know, a false idol, which is exactly what it in a very dangerous one and get cynical about the stupidity of the world and the fact that their are talents weren't properly recognized. And that's just not that helpful because smart is a good thing. But I'll tell you, if you don't use it properly, it will devour you. Just like all arbitrarily assigned talent. Right? So you might have a talent, but it's your friend if you use it properly. And you misuse it, it will be your enemy, and maybe that's how God keeps the cosmic scales adjusted. But anyhow, my friend was a very smart person, although not as smart as he thought he was unfortunately, and, but he hadn't done what would have been necessary with that intelligence to make it manifest itself properly in the world. And that also embittered him because he also knew that there was more that he could have done if he would have done it and perhaps more that he could still do what I was suggesting to him while he was living with us because he was, you know, two levels from homeless by that point was that he should find a job that he could find working in a garage, working in a shop, something like that because he had some mechanical ability and that he should do.

Speaker 1:          10:03          He should separate himself from the arrogance that made him presumed that such a job would be beneath him because at that point no job was beneath him. And, but more importantly, it's not so obvious that jobs are beneath people, you know, because even if you're a, even if you imagine you have a job as a checkout person in a, in a grocery store, you know, as a fairly unskilled job, you can be some miserable, resentful, horrid bastard doing that job. Boy, you know, you can come in there just exuding resentment and bitterness and making mistakes and making sure that every customer that passes by you has a slightly worse day than they need to write. And, and you know, pilfering time and perhaps pilfering goods and being resentful about the people who, who gave you the position because they're above you in the dominance hierarchy and talking, you know, bad things. Gossiping behind the back of your coworkers is like, you can take your menial position self described and turn that into a very nice little slice of hell.
