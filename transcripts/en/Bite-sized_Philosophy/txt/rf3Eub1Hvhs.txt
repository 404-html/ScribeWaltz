Speaker 1:          00:01          I guess they call themselves in cells, involuntary celibates when all this stuff went down with his car, drove his car into a group of people. It's horrible tragedy. I'm one of the things that you talked about within cells is that, and this was a part of the role, what was it? The News in New York Times piece you, you said one of the cures for this is enforced monogamy. People decided and you know, I had never heard that term before quite honestly, and I was like, Whoa, what the fuck does that mean? It's a psychological term and what it means is enforced by culture that it is a good value. Monogamy, polygamy. Polygamous societies tend to become ultra violent. Yeah. That's been known in the anthropological literature for one Hundred Years and certainly leftist anthropologists were among those who discovered it, like she knew the journalist knew perfectly well.

Speaker 1:          00:52          What I meant by enforcement, Augie, she has got a stupid. It's a. You use it as if everybody would understand it because you're an intellectual and because you're a professor and you do. It was also two minutes out of a two day conversation. So if that's how she glanced over, well, it's so funny. That was funny in some sense because my sense is if you want to pillory someone you should attribute to them views that someone somewhere has had and the implication of that part of the New York Times article was that I wanted to take new bile, young women at the point of a gun understate enforcement and deliver them to useless man. It's like no one has ever believed that trinity sounds like that. It's a real. The optics of that statement are very bad, but the question is why didn't. Why wasn't their followup questions and if there was followup questions to get you to define what you mean by enforcement on there were they just didn't make it into the piece.

Speaker 1:          01:47          That's a real problem. Yeah, it's a real problem. That's a real problem because that's what that is. It's so ridiculous because inaccurate definition of who you are. One of the things I've said continually, and this is on record in multiple places, it's like, okay, so you're a young man and all the women are rejecting you. Who's got the problem? It's not all the women. That's a bad road to go down if all the women are rejecting you, it's you. We both agree on this, but why is enforced monogamy the solution for people that are involuntary celibates? Well, it's the solution to the. It's the solution to the relationship between men and women. Fundamentally is monogamous. Social men are unattractive if these on attraction to them, but these men are unattractive to women. I don't mean just physically unattractive mean women aren't seeking them as mates. They need to become men. Yes, they certainly. This is the solution that's the solution. Absolutely. We both agree on this, so what they need to do that in a society where monogamy is the social norm but isn't the social norm anyway? Well, that was partly my point, although to the degree that we deviate from that, we tilt towards a more violent society.

Speaker 2:          03:00          I was making a very minor point. I don't think they're related. Quite honestly, I don't think that involuntary celibates. I don't think that having enforced monogamy as a part of our cultural norm is going to help those people are really just how's it going to help them?

Speaker 1:          03:14          Well, because what happens is if a polygamous society develops, which is the alternative, then a small minority of men get all the women.

Speaker 2:          03:22          That's what happened. That's the only point in this theory, theoretical world where polygamous societies exist and mass and then you do have this problem with a small group of men that are fucking all the women, but that's not.

Speaker 1:          03:39          And also making the women unhappy. Right? Because the women don't have any access to a genuine intimate one to one relationship over any long period of time,

Speaker 2:          03:46          which just doesn't work well. It's the whole idea is and what's best for sure if you have children. Right, but I still don't think that that is why these men are involuntary celibates and I don't think it's the solution to that. I think the solution is that they need to become attractive. Yes, that is the solution is no doubt. I don't. I don't think the two are related.

Speaker 1:          04:06          Well, the only. I was making a minor point. The minor point was that one of the ways that societies around the world have figured out that you keep young male aggression under control is by enforcing monogamous standards because it gives everyone a chance, in some sense,

Speaker 2:          04:21          only point meant meaning. It clears more, uh, more women will be available for one on one relationships rather than one guy who is, you know,

Speaker 1:          04:36          whatever, for whatever reasons, figure in society when you see this happening in universities where women outnumber men, so the man hypothetically have more sexual opportunity, but that isn't what happens. What happens is that a small minority of men have all the sexual opportunity. A fairly large minority of men don't. The women are unhappy because they can't find a committed relationship. It's bad for most of the men and the men who have all the sexual opportunity get cynical,

Speaker 2:          05:01          but isn't this in some ways against your whole idea of equality of outcome because you're, you're talking about equality of sexual outcome. Now, if these men, if you see that Guy James, that's the dominant basketball player that just kicks everyone's ass. This is the, this, this is a guy who succeeded at the highest level, right? Well, there's going to be people like that sexually. There's going to be people that are better at finding mates and this is what they enjoy. They enjoy having many mates. They enjoy being yes, but, but if this is what they enjoy, if it's a man who doesn't want a family and enjoys dating multiple women, why is that bad? Well, I think the fundamental reason it's bad is because it's bad in the long run for children. It's bad for children if he chooses to have children. Yeah. Well that makes sense. But that's it. That's the fundamental mental

Speaker 1:          05:55          issue as far as I'm concerned right now. I think it's the answer. Look to give the journalist credit. That is the point she was making, you know, apart from pillaring me and, and, and, and caricaturizing my perspective. That was the point she was making. Well, first of all, I'm not in favor of unbridled hierarchies like already said that you know, the proclivity of a hierarchy is that all the spoils go to the person at the top and that can destabilize the whole structure, so we have to have a dialogue about how to rectify that,

Speaker 2:          06:22          possibly rectified that. If one man is like, say if we've got one six foot five beautiful man who's got a perfect body and he's brilliant and he just wants to date a bunch of women and all the rest of the people or five foot one and they're fat and they're lazy and like this guy is gonna. If this is the competition, he's going to win. Yeah, Yep. There's no way around this and even if you decide to have enforced monogamy where it becomes a popular thing, the women are going to be more drawn to him. If he chooses to date them, they might decide. I would rather have him sometimes the never actually what does happen, but what is wrong with that? Well, what's wrong with it is that it destabilized the society and it's bad for children. Right. You said that that would have to have children, but there's a lot of people that don't want to have children. There's a lot of people that choose to go their entire life without having children. There's men in their thirties. One, some of my friends dummies. They don't want children. So why? Why would that help in any way? These involuntary celibate?

Speaker 1:          07:30          Well, I think you tilt the society so that it serves the interests of. Well, that's a good question. Do you, but you've seen my point where I see your point. There's no doubt about it.

Speaker 2:          07:40          You're almost having. You're almost forcing an inequality of.

Speaker 1:          07:44          I know that was her point to to the degree that she had a point that was her point now, but it's not. It doesn't run contrary to my opinions that the issue of outcome has to be addressed. Already said there's needs to be a reason for the left and the right, and then the problem with hierarchies. They can get to steep and destabilize everything that does happen. That particularly happens in the sexual domain and there's plenty of anthropological evidence for that, but you still might say, well, who cares? Because the man who are who are winning should be allowed to win in the women should be allowed to choose. Yes, except that there's the problem of children and so society steps in on behalf of the children and you can say, well, lots of people don't want to have children. Yes, and that's truer now than it used to be. Although many of those people end up having children anyways, you know the guys who snooping around all the time, so that doesn't circumvent the problem, but the issue here for me isn't the man or the women, it's the children. We're trying to set up societies where the probability that children will be raised in something approximating optimal environment is optimized and that's going to mean sacrifice of opportunity and choice on the part of the adults.

Speaker 2:          08:49          It's necessary. I agree with you, but I think that what we're talking about mirrors what we're talking about sports.

Speaker 1:          08:56          It mirrors what we're talking about in business. It's everything else. There's going to be people that are better at all different aspects of life. There's going to be people that are talented in terms of like getting women to like that. Yes, that's true, but that's why also look, you see this, women are high pergamum, which means they made up and they meet across and up dominance hierarchies, and so if you're a male who's successful in a given hierarchy, the probability that you're going to have additional mating opportunities is exceptionally high. It's an unbelievably good predictor of that. That hypergo me is a very uncomfortable discussion. Certainly as well. There's plenty of uncomfortable discussions too. That's a big one though. It is the idea that it defines women's sexual choices by the fact that they want beggar bigger, better want someone who's more more successful, someone who's higher on the social ladder than what they're accustomed to or what they have.

Speaker 1:          09:48          What women do is choice is a very difficult problem. So how do you solve that? Well, here's how women solve it. Throw them in a ring. Let them compete at whatever they're competing at. Assume that the man who wins is the best man marry him. Yes. It's a brilliant solution. It's a market oriented solution. It's actually the solution that appears to have driven our evolutionary departure from chimpanzees. It's a biological solution solution which has a cost. What is the cost? The cost is the cost is polygamy, and so we ran that in with enforced monogamy and we do that in order to provide stable, stable circumstances for children. Is polyamorous. Is a polyamorous society just as unattainable as this Utopian Marxist idea? I think so because it looks like, and this is another point I was making that didn't get covered in the article that I wrote about it somewhat extensively on my blog, is that society's tilt towards monogamy across the world is human universal.

Speaker 1:          10:49          Now, that doesn't mean that people don't have polygamous or polyamorous tendencies because they certainly do and it certainly also the case that one of the ways that women Gerrymander this system is that like the number of women and children who are in a say say you're married and you have children with your husband, but you also have an affair and so you have a child by another mat that's more common than anyone suspected, so part of the way that women solve the problem that you're just describing, and I'm not saying anything for this or against this, this is a purely factual biological claim, is they pick a monogamous marriage and they cheat with high status guys. Now you know obviously in the confines of the marriage, that's a terrible thing, but that's a very uncomfortable subject though for women in particular, uncomfortable subject for everyone, but it's a terribly uncomfortable subject.

Speaker 1:          11:41          They don't like the idea that this is a common thing that women choose. A safe man that is willing to be monogamous with them and perhaps maybe they're above him in a social class or in a sexually, and then they'll cheat with someone who was above. It's common, but it's not the norm, right? It's still the norm. Not to do that. The norm is fidelity, but. But there's plenty of exception. This is enforced monogamy, culturally the norm. This is the very definition of monogamy is this. It's like, okay, so my son is getting married in September and so, so let's say he comes to me in a year and he says, Hey dad, guess what? I've had three affairs in the last year and they've all been successful. I haven't got caught. Aren't I a good guy? What am I going to say to that? Know what the hell are you doing? That's not what you're supposed to be doing. That's enforced monogamy enforcement. Origami meaning the people around you try to guide them in a way that you think is going to be harmonious. Family, yes. It's built deep into the cultural norms and if that starts to destabilize, then there's trouble and that doesn't mean that it's not prone to all the problems that you laid out. Look, there isn't a bigger problem than successful reproduction. It is the big problem and all of the solutions that we've generated for it are full of flaws.
