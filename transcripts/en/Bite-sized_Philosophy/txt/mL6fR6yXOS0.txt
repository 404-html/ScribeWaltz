Speaker 1:          00:00          At the end of 1929, the Kremlin decreed that millions of peasants from individually owned farms will be forced into agricultural collectives or cold causes seen in the eyes of the bureau as pliant providers of Soviet agricultural needs in defiance of the facts, so they, the the ologists hammered out inappropriate Marxist terminology to explain what was going on throughout grain producing areas. It was said resistance to this scientific scheme was being organized by so called rich peasants are kulaks with his customer brutality. Therefore stellan decreed the liquidation of the cool acts as a class. We'll stand in like this idea of like group guilt. That was a major theme for Stella and that meant I really didn't have to ever pay attention to you as an individual. I could just decide if you were a doctor, engineer or a Kulak or a German or whatever. Ethnic, racial or educational division happened to characterize my particular target at the time, and it didn't matter if you were guilty as an individual.

Speaker 1:          00:59          That whole notion never even obtained. It was class guilted mattered and if you were in one of those classes, well we're better without you. And of course the nature of the class just changed constantly. But it was perfectly logical thing to think if you believed in like historical determinism, if your parents were rich birch wha, what was the probability that you are going to be a useful part of the workers' collective bs? You're just to get rid of you ahead of time so you didn't cause too much trouble. So then you think about these cool acts, rich peasants, who are these people like when we get down to the individual level, so you go on a village village was full of surfs like not 40 years before. So these are people just struggling out of the feudal society. Right? And you've got some people in there who've managed to be successful enough as farmers, which is no easy thing to like have a house and maybe hire one person and you know, maybe have a little extra food in the larger and a few kind of material possession.

Speaker 1:          01:53          So these are successful people and so you could say, well they're the ones that actually knew how to farm to one theory or you can say the reason they had all this stuff was because they stoled it from all the other people. Right? And then you think, okay, so I marched into town, I'm a Soviet revolutionary, and I say, hey guys, you know those rich people, they stole everything they have from you and then you think, okay, which are you guys is going to listen to that. Well, it's not going to be the sort of struggling people just underneath them who are really trying to get ahead, right? Because that's where they're hoping to get. It's going to be. They're resentful and revengeful few who think, well, the world is fundamentally unfair and it's obvious that those sons of bitches got what they want by stealing it from me.

Speaker 1:          02:32          And here it turns out that if I just go down the street and steal it back, well not only, not only am I allowed to do that, but according to this new and emergent etiology, man, that's the best thing I could possibly do. So then multiply that story by several million participants and you have like the first five years of the Soviet Empire, and so what do we have there? The result was a catastrophic onslaught on millions of peasant households at first, activists and local officials read bullies, right, brutalized peasants, forcing them to surrender their homesteads and their possessions, deportations, arrests, and killing soon followed as terror. Generalized the violence mounted to full scale rebellion in various places with regular troops engaged for months. For example, suppressing peasant uprisings resistance took various forms, usually reflecting the hopeless, desperate anguish of a doomed population in the Ukraine. There were even women's rebellions, spontaneous uprisings of peasant women who attacked the local Coco's is to demand a return of confiscated foreign products with a colossal impact on the Soviet economy.

Speaker 1:          03:41          Peasants slaughtered their animals by the millions rather than see them seized for two years. The fighting raged as the dreadful process of deep Kula Ization continued style in order to further assault on the recalcitrant peasantry. What conquest caused the terror famine of 1932 Moscow rights conquest. It's from a book called the harvest of sorrow. Knowingly decreed green procurement procurement's from the Ukraine. Analysis were exceeding by far with the local population could produce right, which meant that everyone who lived there was forest in order to deliver more grain than they had ever grown. Communist brigades roam the countryside, forcing agriculturalists to disgorge the little they had been able to produce under conditions of severe dislocation. Grain sat unused in state reserves while the local population starved.
