Speaker 1:          00:00          Stolen, same thing, Stalin the great father, right wise man at the helm of the ship of the state. This is after the wall came down, some old man kissing a, a gilded statue, Stalin before it's going to be before it's going to be torn down. There he is with happy children and not the children that his policies starve to death as you, as you might. Well imagine. There is in his military uniform sitting on what's all, for all intents and purposes, a throne. And this is, this is really an uncanny one. It's very positive, right? That's Hitler is or still in his head of state. He's in this hellish Mendola of fire. Perfect with God the father at his head. That's Lennon. You know who people still, who people still revere. Um, you may know and perhaps you don't, that I was nominated to be rector of the University of Glasgow.

Speaker 1:          00:50          And so, which is an honorary position. And today, yesterday the different candidates put up their manifestos in the student newspaper, put them up and then wrote analysis of the manifestos which were biased. And there were appallingly biased in one sided. And I wrote and told them that they said, well, we have a perfect right to our political opinion. And I thought, yeah, well for sure, but you know, you are journalists after all and maybe you could be just trying to tell what's happening. It's like, no, no, no, there's none of that. And they said that one of the candidates that they, uh, that they clearly recommended who seems to be a person who's perfectly heroic in his own right. I mean he's taken on very many difficult legal cases and, and worked for the oppressed and downtrodden who clearly exist. Um, it was either him or another candidate doesn't really matter that they described as bolshy and an outspoken Bolshie meaning Bolshevik, like, it's like, well, you know, he's appropriately Bolshie.

Speaker 1:          01:51          It's like, it's no different than saying, well, he's appropriately not see. Like, like what the hell is that? I mean there were 50 million people that were killed in the Soviet Union by the bowl. She's and maybe twice that many in, in China that, that says nothing about Cambodia and all the other places there were radical left blood bass. You think it's cute to call someone Bolshie Jesus appalling. It's appalling. It's not some fashionable thing that you do. It's participation in some of the deepest intellectual morasses of evil that human beings have ever managed to create, and yet it's fashionable. It shows you what, what the universities are worth. Well, there's the downside of Stella. Yeah. Stella, in his hangman, that sort of cartoon would've gotten you killed in the Soviet Union. There are Stellan as st himself in a stained glass representation. There's a statue of Stella and covered with red paint for the blood after the wall came down there Stellan as what?

Speaker 1:          02:50          It's very much like Medina's Satan, right? You look at that and it's exactly the same. Marketable idea. There's the Americans going. It had a cap in hand, get a little large. Yes. From Papa Stellan. That's a painting of the Communists, forcibly collectivizing, the productive farmers in the Soviet Union in the early 19 twenties. The kulaks right. Everything from whom they stole and rape them and murdered them and ship them off to Siberia and killed them and wiped out the productive farmers of the Soviet Union and then starved 6 million Ukrainians to death. And there is some poor kid in the 19 thirties who's ribs are showing, you know, taking a bath in this part with his eyes wide. And you know, he's one of the fortunate ones because he's still alive. It's like bull sheet. Yeah. Cute. Pretty Fun. Fashionable, lovely.
