Speaker 1:          00:00          It's a great thing to know with people like in your relationships here, here's the key to a good relationship. It's not the only one, but watch your person carefully, carefully, carefully, and whenever they do something that you would like them to do more of, tell them that that was really good and mean it and it's not manipulative because if it's manipulative it won't work. It's like you have to say, wow, I'm so glad you did that. Did you have to be precise? Here's what you just did that I thought was great and Oh boy, that's so nice that you've noticed. I can't believe they could notice. It's like, you know, you do that 20 times and the person will be like the rat. That's just pushing the lever for cocaine. You know, so, but no, I'm serious. It's skinner established this bf skinner noticed this a long time ago.

Speaker 1:          00:44          Reward is intensely useful in terms of modifying behavior, but the problem is is that it's really hard to notice when things are going right, right? Because you're kind of prime to notice when things are going wrong and so you use threat and punishment more often as agents of of shaping the people that you're around. Because you know when everything's going right, it's like, what are you going to say? Everything's going right. It turns to zero. You just assume it and that's not good. That's not good. You want to pay attention and if the. If you're a person, your children, your wife, your whoever, your mother, your sister, if you want them to, if you want to rectify your relationships with them, and I'm not saying to do this in a manipulative wait, won't work, but if they do something that's promoting harmony and peace and goodwill, it's like attend to it.

Speaker 1:          01:38          Tell them that you noticed. It's like it's so useful and you have to get rid of your grudges and your resentment to do that, right? Because you don't want you to kind of mad at your sister and then you know she does something good. You think there is no god damn way, I'm going to reward you for that. So you ignore her when she does something good. It's like, that's brilliant. That is because then you've just punished her for doing what you want. And people do that with their kids all the time, you know, because they let the kids dominate them. Then they get resentful. Then the kid will run up to them to show them something that's kind of spectacular and they'll, they're not happy. They'll say, oh yeah, that's, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm working. You know, little kid has all sad about that and he's just learned something so.

Speaker 1:          02:20          And it's not perhaps what you want them to learn. And so you have to keep your, your relationship with your children pristine. And that means that you can't hold a grudge or resent them. And that means that you have to help them learn how to behave so that you liked them. And that way if they, if you like them and you're kind of sensible and maybe your partner also likes them. So you know, you got a consensus going there, there's a reasonable possibility that other people will actually liked them too, including other children. And then the world will open up to them, you know, then you'll bring them to people's houses and the people will actually smile at them and them a pat on the head and instead of thinking, oh my God, that Brad's coming to visit again, I wonder what it will break this time, you know?

Speaker 1:          03:05          And that's just a horrible thing for your child to experience repetitively in situation after situation. All they learned is that adults have a false smile, but they're really lying all the time. God, it's like a bit of hell. And there's a lot of children who are trapped in that. It's really awful to see. I can see kids like that when I walked down the street, you know, it's like their little doomed things and there they are and you know, they're screwed in 15 different ways and there's no way out of it. It's really awful. So I would not recommend that you do that. It's better to notice that you're a bit of a monster or a lot of a monster. And notice that you are much happier with the people around you when they behave in accordance with reasonable social social norms, and then you actually feel genuinely connected to them and you want to work on their behalf so that everything works out. But if you think you're a good person and that you'd never do anything that was harmful to your children, then you can just forget about that because you'll never take it seriously enough to actually learn.
