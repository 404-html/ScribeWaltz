Speaker 1:          00:00          So people often ask me, do you believe in God, which I don't, I don't like that question. First of all, it's an attempt to to. It's an attempt to box me in in a sense, and the reason that it's an attempt to box me in is because the question is asked so that I can be firmly placed on one side of a two of a binary argument. And, and the reason I don't like to answer it is because a, I don't like to be boxed in and B, because I don't know what the person means by believe or God and they think they know and the probability that they construe belief and construed God the same way I do is virtually zero. So it's, it's a question that doesn't work for me on multiple levels of analysis, but strangely enough, just as we were talking, I the answer to that question popped into my head.

Speaker 1:          00:55          I act as if God exists. Now you can decide for yourself whether that means that I believe in him, so to speak, but I act as if he exists. So that's a good enough answer for that. Then with regards to these other issues, the divinity of Christ, well, I would say the same problems with the question formulation obtain what do you mean by divine and also what do you mean by Christ? These are very, very difficult questions. Now, I believe that for all intents and purposes, I believe that the logos is divine in so far as we. If if by divine you mean of ultimate value of ultimate transcendent value. Yes, it's divine. It's associated with death and rebirth clearly because the logo's dismantles you and rebuilds you, so that's what happens when you make an error. When you make an error, some part of you has to go.

Speaker 1:          01:51          That's the sacrifice you have to let it go. Sometimes it's a big part of you. It's, it's sometimes it can be such a big part of you that you actually die, right? Instead of dying and being reborn, is there something more than merely metaphorical about the idea of being of dying and being reborn? Yes, there is. Because those are associated with physiological transformations. How? What's the ultimate extent of that? That's a good question. You know, the question is what happens to the world around you as you embark, as you increasingly embody the logos and the answer to that is we don't know. We don't know what the ultimate level of this. Now the hypothesis is, and it's a hypothesis that extends to some degree to Buddha as well. The hypothesis is that there has been one or two individuals who managed that and that in their management of that they transcended death itself. Well then you might ask yourself, well, what do you mean by transcended death? Well, in the case of Christ, let's assume he was a historical figure for the, for the time being, which I think is the simplest thing to assume. Uhm, I think there is sufficient evidence to conclude that you could conclude otherwise, but I personally, I feel that there's sufficient evidence to conclude that.

Speaker 1:          03:13          Did He, is his resurrection real but his spirit lives on. That's certainly the case.

Speaker 1:          03:23          In what sense do you mean spirit? Just to qualify that, how well let, let's imagine that a spirit is a pattern of being and we know that patterns can exist. Independent patterns can be transmitted across multiple substrates, right? Vinyl, electronic impulses, air vibrations in your ear, neurological patterns, dance, so all the translation of what you might describe as a spirit, right? It's, it's that pattern. It's independent of its material, substrate. Well, Christ spirit lives on it. It's, it's, uh, it's had a massive effect across time. Well, is that an answer to the question? Did his body resurrect? I don't know. I don't know. It is. The accounts aren't clear for one thing. What the accounts mean isn't clear. I don't know what happened to a person if they bring themselves completely into alignment. I've had intimations of what that might mean. We don't understand the world very well. We don't understand how the world could be mastered if it was mastered completely. We don't know how an individual might be able to manage that. We don't know what transformations that might make possible.
