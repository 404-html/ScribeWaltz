Speaker 1:          00:00          I've been trying to think about the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in relationship to modern sexual confusion,

Speaker 1:          00:09          so this is what I see happening on the social justice front, let's say on the one hand since the 19 sixties and probably as a consequence of the birth control pill, but other factors as well. There's been tremendous stress placed on sexual liberation and so there's this idea that I think is associated in large part right now with the radical left of total sexual freedom, but at the same time there's increasing emphasis from exactly the same sources on restricting sexual interaction. So you see this in the campuses, for example, where increasingly particularly heterosexual contact is regulated by a doctrine that says you have to get spoken permission for every move in the mating process. And so you see, and I know I'm not expressing myself very well, but there seems to be in our current culture, there seems to be massive sexual confusion. It's, it's some weird combination of extreme libertinism and extreme authoritarian attitudes towards sexuality and and obviously in the story of Sodom. Part of what's happening happening and is that sex impulsive? Sexual gratification trumps everything. It's something like that. I mean I know there's more to what's going on in Sodom than that, but there's certainly that and so. Well, I'm trying to figure out what to say about that tonight because there's a. there's a lesson in there. The lesson is something like,

Speaker 1:          01:43          don't let sexuality, don't let impulsive sexuality get the upper hand. It's something like that or all hell will break loose, which I actually happen to agree with because one of the things that we haven't been able to talk about in our culture I think is let's take the idea of the phenomena of aids aids mutated to take advantage of promiscuous sexuality and that's just nothing. You never hear that publicized. You know, people had associated aids with homosexuality and there was a reason for that because it's much more easily transmitted as a consequence of homosexual sex than heterosexual sex because the anus is a much more delicate physiological structure. It's not as robust and it can be much more easily damaged and and, and with with disease resulting as a consequence, but it isn't only the manner of sexual action. That's the issue, it's also the fact that promiscuity provided the evolutionary platform for the aids virus to mutate into a very into the form that it finally took and it was only through by the skin of our teeth that we escaped a totalizing plague. You know, had that emerged 100 years ago. God only knows how many people would have died. It was. AIDS was unbelievably so. I know that's a mishmash of ideas and I'm not exactly sure how to see my way clear through it, but there is a clear warning in that story about, about something, about something to do with, with, with sexual inequity,

Speaker 2:          03:17          but in the Bible that sexuality has to two Poles that define it and it's pretty clear. One, what inside is reproduction and the other side is we could, let's say Rick Creation. Okay, so those are the two poles of sexuality in a normal word. So it's not just for reproduction and it's not just for recreation. It's both. You're right. That was the idea. I mean, it's a natural idea. Now, if you, if there's a balance there that should be had, if you lose this balance and they become just about reproduction, that's a problem and they fed. It becomes just about recreation. That's another problem. Yup. Okay. It's not that complicated really, but it's so politically incorrect to talk about these things even though they're obvious. Well that nobody dares you talk about it.

Speaker 1:          04:11          The thing is is that the most difficult things to talk about are the things that are obvious because when they're obvious you don't have to talk about them and so then when people start to question the obvious, you don't know what to say, so. So for example, we would. I'm thinking about the slut walks and so women go out and they dress very provocatively and they go out and manifest their right to be as provocative as they possibly can be without being interfered with. And I have some sympathy for that perspective because it seems to me appropriate for women to be. The final arbiter is in sexual contact, but on the other hand, it also, it's that whole exercise is blind to the fact that clothing, for example, has communicative intent

Speaker 3:          04:58          and that

Speaker 1:          05:00          people broadcast their invitation to sexual congress in a million ways, subtle and not so subtle, and you can't just say, I have the right to broadcast myself in any manner possible and be completely,

Speaker 3:          05:15          um,

Speaker 1:          05:17          can, can, can be completely immune from the consequences. There's something wrong with that. And with regards to basic sexual morality, no, I've read things about like slut shaming is that the more radical feminist types, for example, claim that women shouldn't be held responsible for their sexual behavior in some sense. It shouldn't be held against them. How many men they've slept with, et cetera. But then I think, well, you'd never recommend to someone that they laid down naked on the, on the side of the street with their legs spread and invite anybody who walks by to partake of the opportunity. Everyone would regard that as inappropriate, I think without question. And so what that indicates is that some degree of sexual propriety is both normative, unethical. And then of course you can start asking yourself about what that degree of social sexual propriety should be. And it does have something to do with getting the balance between reproduction and recreation. Right?

Speaker 2:          06:22          Well, the thing is, even in the Bible, there's the two aspects. Some stories are about just this aspect in. There are the most strange stories in the Bible. For example, the story of Tamar is one of those. So, uh, I don't know if you're familiar with that story, but it's tough. It's in the, it's, it's intercut with the story of Joseph in Egypt and it's essentially a, it says that Judah had children with some woman and I think it's a stranger. It doesn't necessarily say so, but it, it seems like that's what it is. And then the sons die off. And then there's this woman called Tamar and she disguises herself as a prostitute. Great. And she has a kid with Judah himself. So all of the symbols heard that story.

Speaker 1:          07:20          Elements of his clothing. Yeah. Damage

Speaker 2:          07:23          as a, as a bride. Yeah. Essentially

Speaker 1:          07:27          he wants to indicate later that he's the one who slept with.

Speaker 2:          07:29          Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that story is about the necessity, the need for the recreative part of sexuality. It's all about that symbolism. It's all about the seat. It's all about incest, it's all about death and it's the idea is it's to raise the dead. Okay. It's not clear in the story, but if you understand, if you understand the imagery, that's what it's about. It's about regressing back to an error that was made. Okay. And raising the dead. So I don't want to get into it. But it's just the idea that in the Bible there's both to the hearse reproduction and there's recreation and the recreation is renewal. There's the renewal. Sexuality is about renewal too. But that aspect of the symbolism is, is pretty. I don't want to say obscure because it's actually right there if you can see it, but it's strange. I'll say it like that.

Speaker 1:          08:29          Strange. Okay. So now another element of this might be the fact that in modern identity politics, sexual choice is a canonical identifier and that also seems to me to be something wrong about that. Like one of the things I've seen happening in Toronto, I'm sure it's the same in Montreal, is that, and I'm going to do this awkwardly, I'm going to put this awkwardly because I haven't been able to sort through it properly. Um, pride week, Pride Day has turned into pride week and that's turned into pride month and I think that seems to me to be pushing against some kind of limit because the first question that I have is like I was reading this book the other day by a friend of mine from Ottawa who's a gay conservative and he said he had a lot harder time coming out as a conservative then he had as coming out as gay and he talked about the degree to which homosexuals were persecuted in Canada before say the 19 eighties. And it's quite, it makes quite a harsh reading, let's say. And so and so fair enough to the, to the civil rights movement, let's say it, that, that has brought homosexuality into the norm or that into the mainstream. Maybe that's one way of thinking about it, but that conversation still has a tremendous amount of development. That's necessary because I don't understand exactly,

Speaker 1:          10:05          it isn't obvious to me what integration into the mainstream precisely means because a lot, there's been a lot of talk so far about

Speaker 1:          10:13          respecting the rights of gay people, but very little talk about what the accompanying responsibilities might be. Not Actually, it seems to me to be a problem and I mean I just had a letter from, from Guy Gay guy who has been wrestling with this because he's not sure how to be gay and to be ethical at the same time, you know, because he sees part of normative behavior is taking wife and having children and not and can see the value in that, but that's certainly not the direction of his proclivity. And so we wrote, wrote to me asking me what he should do and you know, I don't have an answer for that. I don't know what the answer to that is, but I know that it might be something that would be worth talking about and it's part of this current confusion about sexual identity and sexual pleasure and, and well even gender identity for that matter. So. All right, so your idea was, well the balance between recreation and reproduction had gone, was completely absent inside of it was all recreation. It was all instant gratification. Impulse.

Speaker 2:          11:22          Yeah. And that's why it's put in contrast with the Abraham bit because it's the same angels, but in that case he, he says you'll have a son this time next year, so it's the reproduction part is there, but when he gets to the bottom, it's not there anymore. It's only the recreation part. Okay. So yeah, so they're, they're, they're meant to be contested. Those two stores actually in the story of Abraham, it's pretty clear he, I don't know if this will make sense because when the angels come it, it says, um, he washes their feet and then he feeds them. Okay. That's actually the recreation and reproduction part that not in terms of sexuality, but it's in terms of meaning the renewal, the washing of the feet is the recreation part, their renewal, they're restarting and the feeding is the reproduction part. Not, not in a sexual way, but when you feed something food and he eats it, it integrates, it integrates it correctly. That's like our reproduction of your identity, your you're staying yourself, you're reproducing yourself, so when you eat food, that's what you're doing. Not like I said, not in a sexual way, but it has the exactly the same. Meaning if you eat something that you can integrate correctly, you're reproducing your pattern. It's like the correct version of yourself. The other side,

Speaker 1:          12:51          the washing is like, is little flood

Speaker 2:          12:55          the fuck. So many flood,

Speaker 1:          12:58          right? It also is an acceptable. It's a controlled one. You're washing the dust off the roads, dust off your feet. It means that you're. You're passing from one mode of being into another because you're. You're cleaning off the debris of the past. It's something like that and it's about renewal next. Okay, so you have to see that when, when, when matthew was talking about, yeah, and you have recreation, you have to understand that recreation and rest are basically the same thing. Then you basically have the same meaning. It's sleeping. Resting recreation are all things that bring you into renewal. Okay, bye.

Speaker 2:          13:34          And dying. That's what dying is. It's passing into another state letting something else have a chance. That's quit tying is it's then.
