Speaker 1:          00:00          The only people who now get married are people who are relatively wealthy. You know the fact that we've disrupted the structure of marriage as an institution since about 1965 say what that's meant what that has meant is that it's its benefits are now only available to people who are privileged so you can look up the Stout's yourself. But if you're middle class and above the divorce rates haven't moved much since the early 70s if you're working class and below it's a complete catastrophe. And what that's meant is that most meant many children who are in. Rougher socioeconomic straits are being raised by a single person who has absolutely and 100 percent overwhelmed by their multiple commitments right full time responsibility for children and generally in employment in extraordinarily dismal low paying unstable and exploitative job. So to me if you if you're like you guys are you're all going to be middle class or above in all likelihood it's like it's fine for you. It's not going to make a bloody bit of difference. All things considered but for people who are poor it's just been a catastrophe. So. So. Yes. Oh well there's all sorts of reasons. I mean first of all it's become socially acceptable. Right. Divorce wasn't socially acceptable. And you can say well that's that was pretty hard on people who wanted to get divorced. It's like yeah obviously any rule is hard on people that break it but that doesn't mean that there shouldn't be rules you know. Now what rules there should be. That's a whole different issue. Out of wedlock child birth has become a norm.

Speaker 2:          01:50          It was absolutely rare in the 90s in the early 1960s vanishingly rare. And that's become it's it's acceptable even though all the evidence suggests like if you actually look at the evidence it's absolutely clear that kids who have two parents do better than kids who have one. Now you know people when you tell people that they'll tell you an anecdote about someone they knew maybe their own parent who did a wonderful job of raising them as a single person. It's like the anecdotes are irrelevant. What's relevant is the bulk of the evidence. Of course there are situations where people are better apart than together. And of course there are situations where one person can do a better job than two people who are at each other's throats but it's aggregate it's aggregating examples that you use when you're doing a scientific survey and the results of those surveys are crystal clear. You know the other thing that's going to happen it's going to happen very soon is that there is going to be a very very very very large number of elderly people. Who are low and.

Speaker 1:          02:52          B and elderly and a loan like no family that is not something you want to look forward to especially when you start thinking that you're going to be elderly for like 40 years. So you know because say say it starts around 65. I don't know how long you guys are going to live but it's probably 95 is not an unreasonable estimate and it might be longer than that. So because you know we're adding about three months to the total lifespan every year. Right. That's the rate of technological improvement in relationship to overall mortality. So you know and that the degree to which we're adding that extra. LifeSpan is increasing each year. You know and it may hit yet to the point where we're increasing lifespan a year every year. Now I doubt it because it probably is. It will probably be in a asymptote but. It has been increasing for a very long period of time. So you know. It's one thing to think about the maximization of day to day freedom when you're between say 15. And 40 45 after that. That's a whole different story. And but modern people never think about the last half of their life. No soul. Why. I don't know but maybe they're afraid to or something.
