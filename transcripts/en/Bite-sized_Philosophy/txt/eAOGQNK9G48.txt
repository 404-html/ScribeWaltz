Speaker 1:          00:01          We certainly choose each other for self awareness and consciousness and intelligence, and I don't know if you're, if you're choosing a mate, there's an arms race in human beings. We're choosing intelligent mates. Especially that's especially the case for women in relationship to men. So, um, so that, the idea that that's a choice. Well, that's partly why it's even that makes himself conscious in the garden of Eden, right? She offers them the apple. She's the one that makes him self conscious and I think that's actually accurate because the evidence from the evolutionary biologists is that human sexual female sexual selection was what are the driving factors that differentiated us from chimpanzees. It's a major factor. Chimpanzee females are not selective maters. They go into estrus, they'll mate with anything. What happens is the dominant males chased the subordinate males away and so they end up leaving more offspring, but it's not a consequence of selection on the part of the females in human beings.

Speaker 1:          00:55          It's completely different. Concealed ovulation and intense selection pressure from women on men. You have twice as many female ancestors as you have male ancestors and people could never have have a hard time working that out arithmetically, but it's not that problematic. You just think on average, every woman had one child, half of men had none, and the other half had to. And that's approximately correct if you average across the entire history of human sexuality. So human males in particular are subject to a vicious selection, pressure on the part of females, and I also think that's partly why nature is represented symbolically as female among human beings, because after all, nature is what selects. There's no better definition of the nature then that which selects.
