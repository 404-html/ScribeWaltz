Speaker 1:          00:00          Borders are reasonable. How about that? The law is the border that stops someone from stealing your

Speaker 1:          00:19          laptop. If it's an apple laptop, what's the sort of laptop that has social justice warrior would carry and then the social justice warrior is going to be very irritated if you happen to purloin their laptop and then you might point out to them, you know it's a border that protects you from having that thing taken and they say, well, the borders should be open. It's okay man, no problem, and you hand over that laptop right now and everything else you own too. If you don't like borders and you can get rid of the damn walls in your house and you don't need doors on your bedroom either and we can keep an eye on you whenever we want and so much for borders. One of the things that really differs between liberals and conservatives between the left and the right is the right is in the right legs, tight borders between things.

Speaker 1:          01:00          It's part of being conscientious at every level, conceptually, sexually, familiarly, provincially, nationally. The right says, look, let's keep. Let's keep the borders between things pretty distinct and the left says, yeah, maybe not because some of those borders are in the wrong place and a little bit more free flow of information wouldn't be a bad thing, and the thing is that right, but so are the Conservatives and that's why you have to talk. It's like, well, we've got some borders. That's a good thing. Maybe some of them need to be moved around a little bit and that's what the political dialogue is for, but that doesn't mean that borders themselves are a bad idea. They're a great idea because without borders, everything Nash's into the same untenable state of undifferentiated chaos and you can't live in that. And so the people who are trying to tear down the borders conceptually, politically and practically what they want is the chaos that that would bring the either want that or they're too foolish to know that their pursuits will produce that.

Speaker 1:          01:56          So let's, let's, let's be a little bit clear that if you stand up and say, yeah, borders, they're okay, they've got their problems, but they're okay. That doesn't make you a bigot beyond redemption. It just makes you someone with some sense and it's actually okay to be someone with some sense limits on immigration are also reasonable while we need to figure out what those limits are and that's what the bloody political dialogue is for, but the fact that it should be limited to some degree is also reasonable. Otherwise, why not just open the borders and let everybody come in? Well, the reason you don't do that is because a complex system cannot tolerate extensive transformation over too short a period of time. Now you want immigrants to come in, especially if they're the sorts of immigrants who are likely to contribute properly to the success of your policy and lots of immigrants do that.

Speaker 1:          02:50          I mean, I think the vast majority, for example, of entrepreneurs in the United States come from the Indian subcontinent, so great. You know, bring them over. They're highly educated, they're extraordinarily productive. They make lots of new businesses and then they pump money like back, like mad back in India. Good deal. But that doesn't mean that we have. We have our arms are open to everyone immigration policy because it's complete rubbish. All that means is you're not thinking about it, so when here's the coded to that for conservatives. Here's something I've been thinking about this a lot lately. It should not be assumed that citizens have societies that have not evolved functional individual rights predicated polities will hold values in keeping with such qualities. So we could say, look, there are a lot of countries in the world that are not governed well, the vast majority of them, right, and they've been not governed well forever, and to me that means that there's something wrong with the values that are held collectively by the people who've established those policies. Well, you shouldn't be naive and assume that merely because you moved them to a new country, they're going to let their innate democratic longings, Florida.

Speaker 2:          04:02          It doesn't work that way.
