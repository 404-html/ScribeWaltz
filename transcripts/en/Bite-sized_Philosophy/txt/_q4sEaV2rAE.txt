Speaker 1:          00:00          And the thing about a comprehensive narrative is it can't leave out and archetipal character or it fails. I can give you an example of this. Okay. So how many of you have seen Disney sleeping beauty? Okay. So, so many of you have. How many Harvard? Okay. So, so there's a few that happened while the Disney movies, you know, they're kind of standard childhood fairy in sleeping beauty. What happens is that the king and queen give birth to a princess after trying for a substantial amount of time and you know, she arrives healthy and beautiful and then they have a christening day and they invite everybody to it, but they don't invite maleficent who's a dark, which roughly speaking, you know, like she's, uh, she's queen of the underworld that for, for lack of a better word, she's the negative element of femininity and they don't invite her to the party.

Speaker 1:          00:51          And so she shows up anyways and says that because they didn't invite her, their daughters going to die when, when she had 16, which is roughly the age of, let's say, sexual maturation for a story of that sort. Now there's another little positive magic female in the story who mitigates that death sentence to protracted sleep. While the idea behind it, it's a very, very interesting story. It's an incredible story in a sense because what it says is that if your parents protect you too much from the dark side of life when you're young, that what will happen when you start to on the road to maturity is you'll be so naive and so fragile that you'll want to be unconscious instead of paying attention and that you're going to have to be rescued from that state by something and it could be a prince, which is one which is how that story plays itself out.

Speaker 1:          01:53          Or it also could be the symbolically masculine and exploratory element of your own psyche, and the stories are ambivalent about whether it's an external event or an intern with and it doesn't really matter. You know, the, the, the things ended up being the same. And so that's actually what happens in this sleeping beauty story. You know, at the end, a prince who's also enslaved by this terrible negative feminine force, manages to escape and the maleficent turns into a dragon and he has to fight her and then he goes and rescues the princess and she wakes up and the kingdoms rejuvenated and everybody's happy. It's a classic classic story, you know, and it's not. It's funny because the Disney movie frozen was put forward as a, in some sense as a feminist alternative to the classic fairytales. And first of all, you can't do that. You can't just generate a fairytale.

Speaker 1:          02:47          You know, there's recent evidence that some of these fairytales, the ones that the grimm brothers and the and Hans Christian Andersen collective are up to 10,000 years old. You can't just come up with a counter fairytale. That's, that's just not how it works. And the way that fairy tale is structured, it has nothing to do with, with the necessity for anyone to rely on anyone else for anything. It's a complex portrayal of the denied dynamic relationship between archetypal characters. And you know, it's one form of the story. There's lots of different forms of the story, but what I liked about sleeping beauty for example, and Mrs, what's Nice about the real fairy tales is that along with the positive there is negative and it's real negative. Like real fairy tales are terrified and like I don't. Who is it? Is it sleeping beauty or in Snow White, I don't remember.

Speaker 1:          03:40          In one of the famous grimm fairy tales, one of the evil sisters ends up dancing and red hot shoes until she dies. You know, it's, they're very, very violent and and unsettling, and it's because they, you know, they have the quality of genuine folk tales, but the reason for that is because they're dealing with real things like the Hansel and Gretel story is a good example of that, right? Kids are abandoned out in the woods. They find something that's too good to be true inside this thing that's too good to be true is something that wants to fatten them up and devour them. It's a rough story, but what it's doing at the stories, the stories have evolved to represent the fundamental dynamic elements of existence. If you conceptualize existence in, in, in terms of character, and the thing is you have to conceptualize existence in terms of character if you're a person because what you do in existence is act out your character, so your character is an element of existence.

Speaker 1:          04:39          Now you might say, well that doesn't mean that society has a character, but actually it does mean that because partly what happens, like if you're a socialized, say into a culture, the culture exists in the same relationship to you roughly speaking as another person does. So for example, if you put money in the bank, which is in principle a representation of your labor. What you're doing is entering into a contract with the broader social world, which is one of promise essentially where the future society promises to return your value at a future date. So it's a contractual relationship and the reason that God, the father is a very common representation is because treating the they in in Heideggerian terms, the others in Heideggerian terms as if they're an embodied entity actually works.
