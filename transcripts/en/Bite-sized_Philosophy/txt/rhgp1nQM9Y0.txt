Speaker 1:          00:00          So anyways, Pinocchio was transformed into a victim and he's offered this, he's offered this identity and he takes it. Now, it's partly because he's deceived and manipulated, but it's also partly because of the fox offers him the abandonment of responsibility as payment for as payment for adopting the victim identity. So this is where his own lack of morality, let's say, because this is all about Pinocchio. Development as a character plays a role in his demise. So if I'm a victim than everyone else owes me something and I don't have to take any responsibility. And so one of the things I've wondered, here's something to think about. It might be that the sense of meaning that life can provide to you is proportionate to the amount of responsibility you decide to take on. Not. That'd be very strange if it was the case, you know, because responsibility of course is a kind of weight obviously, and it's difficult to take on responsibility, but if any positive emotion that you feel and your control of anxiety and the control over pain is dependent on the activation of these systems that watch you move towards a desired goal, then the more complete and weighty the goal is, the more kicked there's going to be in the observation that you're moving towards it.

Speaker 1:          01:23          And, uh, you know, you kinda already know this because you'll, you'll have observed in your own life that when you're engaged in something that you believe in, that the time passes properly, you know, you can see this even if you're, maybe you're reading a paper and it's actually related in some intelligible manner to something that you want to learn. So even though it's difficult, you get engaged in it, you can remember it better, you can process it better and you don't. You're not so likely to fall asleep and you're not so likely to want to find distractions. All of that, you can get into it and it would be very interesting if that was proportionate to the degree of responsibility that you're willing to shoulder and I think you can make a strong case for that. I've also often wondered, imagine you could offer people a choice.

Speaker 1:          02:10          Here's the choice. You could say, well, your life isn't meaningful. Denialists have got it right. There's no meaning in your life and because of that, there's no reason for you to accept any responsibility so you can live a responsibility for your life and maybe one of the impulsive pleasure seeking better responsibility, free life, but the price you pay is that it doesn't get to be meaningful. Or you could say to someone, no, we're going to do the opposite. We're going to say you can live a meaningful life, but it's only going to be as meaningful as the amount of responsibility that you're willing to bear. And then you might say, well, what would people choose? Because everybody also always makes noises about wanting to have a meaningful life, but if the price you pay for that is the adoption of responsibility that it's not so obvious that people would choose meaning over, you know, over pointless pursuits if they had to, if the benefit they go out for choosing the pointless pursuits was that they really didn't have to care about anything they ever did.

Speaker 1:          03:09          Right? Snow responsibility. And that's really what Pinocchio is offered. And that's what the coachman offers them. And that's interesting because, you know, so far it's been the Fox and the cat and they were kind of to bid hoods. And so the pathological pathway that they offer Pinocchio is not the worst of the pathological pathways, but here, at least as far as the imagination, the collective imagination that created this movie is concerned, is this is where you get to the most pathological form of, let's call it temptation. And that's the temptation to engage in, to abandon responsibility and to engage in impulsive, pleasure seeking short term pleasure seeking. So here's the Fox pretending to be a doctor investigating, um, Pinocchio's illness. And He makes some notes, which is all just meaningless, scribbled, right? It's like white noise and it doesn't matter that the arguments that he's making is are completely incoherent and it doesn't matter that he actually doesn't know anything. He what he's selling is easy to buy. And so Pinocchio buys it and by the end of the conversation with the Fox, he's pretty convinced that he's useless and it needs a vacation. No, this is anita postage inedible situation as well, which I touched on the other lecture. I mean,

Speaker 1:          04:41          that's fair. Let's imagine that you have a child that is a little on the neurotic side, so high negative emotion and maybe one that's also a little bit on the east side, so has a variety of, let's say relatively minor ailments, but the ailments nonetheless. So what that means as a parent will say, mother, for this example, because I want to use the apple example, you have to make a decision all the time about exactly how you're going to treat that child. One decision is, well, I'm not gonna. You don't have to go to school today because you're not feeling well. It's like fair enough, but do you make the same decision the next day and do you make the same decision the next day and let's imagine that you enable the child to avoid responsibility as a consequence of capitalizing on their illness. Well then that's not going to be very good for the child.

Speaker 1:          05:33          The rule within a sickly child has to be something like, I'm going to push you right to your limit because otherwise, how is the person going to figure out what they can do? And if they can't figure out what they can do, then you're not going to be able to make their way in the world at all. And then that gets muddied very badly. If you're not exactly sure that you want them to make their way in the world. You know, maybe you're just as happy because you'd be sitting at home alone if your child was there with you and maybe you'd be just as happy at some level if they never grew up at all because then they won't leave. And so, and maybe that's because you have a terrible marriage and your lonesome. You know, maybe it's an abusive marriage and your husband has chased away all your friends and so you don't have anything at all and maybe that's because he didn't stand up for yourself very well apart from the fact that he was, you know, tyrannical and is central nature and so then all those little warps and bends in your psyche are going to manifest themselves.

Speaker 1:          06:28          Right, right. In the background of every single one of those decisions. My daughter had a lot of illnesses when she was an adolescent and they were very serious and it was very difficult to figure out what to do about that because you couldn't exactly apply normative rules. Right. And we always had to figure out if she was

Speaker 1:          06:52          communicating her symptoms to us, how seriously to take those and dancer was the least amount of serious possible. It's something like that because we needed to do and she needed to know what she could do in spite of the fact that she had problems. And one of the things I really tried to instill in her, and I think it worked, is that you don't ever want to use it your illness as an excuse for not doing anything, not consciously. You know, sometimes you might not know, I'm not feeling well. How? What can I do? What you don't know, right? Because sometimes when you're not feeling well, you can do more than you think. And sometimes you can do less than you think. It's not like it's obvious, but sometimes it's obvious. You know this little temptation flits through your mind and you think, well, I don't really want to do what I'm doing today and I'm not feeling very well so I don't have to do it.

Speaker 1:          07:39          You do that 100 times. Then you don't know how sick you are anymore and then you're. Then you're in real trouble because not only are you sick, but you actually have. You've muddied the waters and so you have both problems. That is you're actually ill and you've betrayed yourself by using that as an excuse not to pursue your responsibilities and not. I think if you do both of those, both of those things happened to you at the same time. You're in real trouble and it's really hard not to have that happen. So anyways, I know gail gets enticed into believing that he's the victim. The fact that he's insufficient is used as an excuse by the Fox and the and the cat to offer him a trip to pleasure island, and this is, I think where the movie gets particularly dark and so off they go singing away. They have to carry them. So you could say, in some sense, he's carried by societal pathology and his own trouble. He's carried like a puppet off to pleasure island.
