1
00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>So what does it mean for this symbol to </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerge from the feminine symbol,</v>

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to emerge from chaos?</v>

3
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this picture,</v>

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>this is a picture of Venus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goddess of love,</v>

5
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I cut this picture out of a </v>

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.801
<v Speaker 1>larger picture and it's Venus </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifesting yourself in a transcendent </v>

7
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:22.461
<v Speaker 1>space in the sky in the same way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ did in the previous </v>

8
00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:23.940
<v Speaker 1>representation and she has raised coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>off her.</v>

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>And there's all these men who are nights</v>
<v Speaker 1>kneeling in front of the image.</v>

10
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

11
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that men use the image of </v>

12
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.020
<v Speaker 1>female perfection to motivate </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

13
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's precisely what they do.</v>

14
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:43.311
<v Speaker 1>You see that in the Tom Sawyer story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Tom Sawyer is about 12 years old and </v>

15
00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:47.751
<v Speaker 1>he's still hanging around with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends like huck Finn and this word </v>

16
00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>girl moves across the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becky and she comes out and he's struck </v>

17
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.201
<v Speaker 1>by her for the first time in his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's changed and the first thing </v>

18
00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>he does is hot pop on a picket fence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>show off and balance in front of her.</v>

19
00:00:57.331 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>And he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

20
00:00:57.811 --> 00:00:58.930
<v Speaker 1>look at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at me.</v>

21
00:00:58.931 --> 00:01:03.931
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like the male bowerbird building </v>

22
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 1>something beautiful so the female will </v>
<v Speaker 1>approve of it and it's,</v>

23
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 1>it's motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

24
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that I think modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>women don't really understand about men.</v>

25
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.130
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand that at least to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the degree that males are uncorrupted </v>

26
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>and not better because of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejected,</v>

27
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:23.451
<v Speaker 1>they're doing everything they can to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kneel before the eternal image of the </v>

28
00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:23.451
<v Speaker 1>feminine</v>

29
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.850
<v Speaker 1>and try to make themselves worthy as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chivalry story.</v>

30
00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:33.851
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you should encourage your </v>

31
00:01:33.851 --> 00:01:35.621
<v Speaker 1>partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and so out of chaos emerges this </v>

32
00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:36.260
<v Speaker 1>first form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the feminine form.</v>

33
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.800
<v Speaker 1>It's partly the form that represents </v>
<v Speaker 1>novelty as such so and,</v>

34
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.820
<v Speaker 1>and on one hand its promise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand it's threat that you </v>

35
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.840
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know because I don't know.</v>

36
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the situation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>women as well as I understand the </v>

37
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.510
<v Speaker 1>situation with men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously being a man,</v>

38
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.500
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if women have any idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>how paralyzing they are to especially </v>

39
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:03.590
<v Speaker 1>young men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a large,</v>

40
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.260
<v Speaker 1>very large number of my clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>clients,</v>

41
00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:11.261
<v Speaker 1>but also young men I've talked to in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general are absolutely terrified of </v>

42
00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:15.380
<v Speaker 1>women because they're terrified of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>rejected and the terror exist in precise</v>

43
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:17.690
<v Speaker 1>proportion to the retraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the woman,</v>

44
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.900
<v Speaker 1>which is a horrible paradoxical </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation to be in.</v>

45
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:25.901
<v Speaker 1>It's often why man makes such fools of </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in front of women that </v>

46
00:02:25.901 --> 00:02:27.320
<v Speaker 1>they're attracted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because first of all,</v>

47
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:32.321
<v Speaker 1>they don't see the woman that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to because what the hell do </v>

48
00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:32.870
<v Speaker 1>they know about her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't see her as an individual.</v>

49
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.260
<v Speaker 1>They see her as the manifestation of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgmental ideal and then it's only in </v>

50
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:43.451
<v Speaker 1>establishing the relationship with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual woman that they can start </v>

51
00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:46.490
<v Speaker 1>differentiating between the judgmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal and the actual individual woman.</v>

52
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.210
<v Speaker 1>And that also requires the sacrifice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sacrifice is</v>

53
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>you never can have an ideal woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to have a relationship with any </v>

54
00:02:56.781 --> 00:02:59.240
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to sacrifice the relationship,</v>

55
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>the ideal woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to see the individual woman</v>

56
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.970
<v Speaker 1>and separate her from the ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the same thing that happens </v>

57
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>to the hero in sleeping beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

58
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:14.611
<v Speaker 1>He sees the evil queen who actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns into the dragon of chaos and it's </v>

59
00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>not until he can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can defeat her,</v>

60
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>that he can establish a relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the actual princess.</v>

61
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a wonderful my clients who ran </v>

62
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>this men's group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was quite interesting.</v>

63
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:32.761
<v Speaker 1>One of the things they had initiates do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was very intelligent,</v>

64
00:03:33.741 --> 00:03:36.890
<v Speaker 1>was to go out and ask 50 women in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day for their phone numbers.</v>

65
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Why politely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly you don't want.</v>

66
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:41.780
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a,</v>

67
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.850
<v Speaker 1>it was a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't a stupid game.</v>

68
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 1>And the idea was get over your fear of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rejection and how do you do that by </v>

69
00:03:49.761 --> 00:03:54.761
<v Speaker 1>encountering it continually and </v>
<v Speaker 1>continually and continually so that </v>

70
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:56.660
<v Speaker 1>you're no longer paralyzed by this.</v>
