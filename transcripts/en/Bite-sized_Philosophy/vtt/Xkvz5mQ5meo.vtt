1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.360
<v Speaker 1>So my question to you is a social </v>
<v Speaker 1>contract or a legal system replaced </v>

2
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:09.310
<v Speaker 1>religion as moral framework and a way we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are?</v>

3
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it's because it's because of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gap between what we articulated and what</v>

4
00:00:15.971 --> 00:00:18.820
<v Speaker 2>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something has to fill that gap.</v>

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.550
<v Speaker 2>Like I think the law could be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>

6
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.370
<v Speaker 2>could replace it if the law was total,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't.</v>

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.650
<v Speaker 2>It's bounded and the incorrect and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something in risks.</v>

8
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.890
<v Speaker 2>It has to rest on something inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like this mediator between what </v>

9
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:35.740
<v Speaker 2>we articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we don't understand.</v>

10
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.950
<v Speaker 2>It's something like customer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like expectation.</v>

11
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.010
<v Speaker 2>It's something like the intrinsic sense </v>
<v Speaker 2>of justice,</v>

12
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.990
<v Speaker 2>you know that the law itself is aiming </v>
<v Speaker 2>at and those aren't fully articulated,</v>

13
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.240
<v Speaker 2>but without them there'd be no </v>
<v Speaker 2>grounding.</v>

14
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Like without the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the law would be a dictionary,</v>

15
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.080
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't know what a word means,</v>

16
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.910
<v Speaker 2>using the dictionary is helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not that helpful because like unless</v>

17
00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Speaker 2>you've had the experience of anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dictionary,</v>

18
00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:06.730
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you what anger means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just refers to other words,</v>

19
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 2>but the words themselves refer to </v>
<v Speaker 2>something else and the law refers to </v>

20
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 2>something else.</v>

21
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.490
<v Speaker 2>And without that it has to be in tune </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that something else.</v>

22
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.500
<v Speaker 2>It has to be in accordance with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I don't think we can ever </v>

23
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.960
<v Speaker 2>delineate the proper body of laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's also why you like ideological</v>

24
00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:30.571
<v Speaker 2>utopias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See the ideological utopia is dispensed </v>

25
00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:31.930
<v Speaker 2>with the transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

26
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.420
<v Speaker 2>this is what we need to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

27
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.650
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>

28
00:01:35.651 --> 00:01:37.120
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not good.</v>

29
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 2>You have to leave space for what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of know and for what you don't </v>

30
00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.750
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

31
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the story of the Tower of Babel,</v>

32
00:01:44.891 --> 00:01:49.720
<v Speaker 2>human beings make this massive building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to reach up to the heavens</v>

33
00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:51.940
<v Speaker 2>so that it'll take the place of God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

34
00:01:51.941 --> 00:01:56.941
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the earliest warning we have of </v>

35
00:01:56.941 --> 00:02:00.630
<v Speaker 2>the danger of making things so big that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you confuse them with God and God gets </v>

36
00:02:01.211 --> 00:02:06.211
<v Speaker 2>irritated and comes down and makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody speak different languages and </v>

37
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:06.211
<v Speaker 2>scatters them.</v>

38
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:06.211
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

39
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:10.621
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens when you try to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>something a totality is that it starts </v>

40
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:14.300
<v Speaker 2>to fragment inside and disintegrates </v>
<v Speaker 2>into catastrophe and so it's,</v>

41
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.240
<v Speaker 2>it's almost as if we have to maintain </v>
<v Speaker 2>this articulated space inside the dream,</v>

42
00:02:19.241 --> 00:02:21.490
<v Speaker 2>inside the custom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

43
00:02:21.491 --> 00:02:26.491
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the same as having </v>

44
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:26.710
<v Speaker 2>respect for the fact that we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies.</v>

45
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not just abstract creatures that </v>

46
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.030
<v Speaker 2>follow rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not that at all.</v>

47
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.990
<v Speaker 2>We only follow certain rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We won't follow the other ones and our </v>

48
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.950
<v Speaker 2>societies will crumble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

49
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.410
<v Speaker 2>and we just don't know enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>articulate the entire landscape of </v>

50
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.570
<v Speaker 2>behavior with articulated rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>

51
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.250
<v Speaker 2>We can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's beyond us.</v>

52
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
