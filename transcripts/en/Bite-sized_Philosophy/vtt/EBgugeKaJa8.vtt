00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Hi Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my question is,</v>

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.330
<v Speaker 1>I know you stated in the last lecture </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the importance for setting aims in </v>

3
00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:14.120
<v Speaker 1>life and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kind of have goals,</v>

4
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.450
<v Speaker 1>goals to work towards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5
00:00:16.451 --> 00:00:18.010
<v Speaker 1>So my question was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you,</v>

7
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.530
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that if you don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you want to go because that's kind</v>

8
00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:28.531
<v Speaker 1>of where I got stuck on your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your future off authoring program </v>

9
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:28.531
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

10
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:28.531
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

11
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:30.500
<v Speaker 2>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a really good question.</v>

12
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's echoed to some degree in </v>

13
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.670
<v Speaker 2>the structure of the biblical stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in this manner.</v>

14
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.030
<v Speaker 2>So there's this notion in the Old </v>
<v Speaker 2>Testament that morality is following a </v>

15
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.321
<v Speaker 2>sequence of prohibitions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of bad things you </v>

16
00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't do and then basically you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>good enough and,</v>

17
00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think there's wisdom in that.</v>

18
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:55.340
<v Speaker 2>I think that's kind of where children </v>
<v Speaker 2>start,</v>

19
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

20
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love children and all that,</v>

21
00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:03.041
<v Speaker 2>but they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're crazy little creatures and they </v>

22
00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:05.801
<v Speaker 2>need to be civilized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And partly what you do is you lay </v>

23
00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:10.791
<v Speaker 2>prohibitions on them and mostly what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to do is lay prohibitions </v>

24
00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:13.520
<v Speaker 2>on them for the behaviors that if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>manifested,</v>

25
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:18.521
<v Speaker 2>would make their life miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have another chapter in this book </v>

26
00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:21.911
<v Speaker 2>that I'm writing called don't let your </v>
<v Speaker 2>children do anything that makes you </v>

27
00:01:21.911 --> 00:01:21.911
<v Speaker 2>dislike them.</v>

28
00:01:21.911 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 2>And the idea there is that your job as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>parent is to help your children become </v>

29
00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:31.961
<v Speaker 2>the sort of four year olds that adults </v>
<v Speaker 2>genuinely smile out when they come into </v>

30
00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:36.701
<v Speaker 2>a room because that makes the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>social environment both truthful and </v>

31
00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:40.541
<v Speaker 2>welcoming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so your job is to make them </v>

32
00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:43.870
<v Speaker 2>desirable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Social beings and lot of that is </v>

33
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.870
<v Speaker 2>prohibition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

34
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.390
<v Speaker 2>There's this ethical transformation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it happens to some degree in the,</v>

35
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 2>in the tradition of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the prophetic tradition where there's</v>

36
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.990
<v Speaker 2>a spirit that seems in some sense to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rise above the law,</v>

37
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:58.991
<v Speaker 2>but there's a real transformation </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the old testament and the new </v>

38
00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:00.290
<v Speaker 2>testament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Old Testament is prohibition and the</v>

39
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.160
<v Speaker 2>New Testament is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

40
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:06.161
<v Speaker 2>here's the good things you do once </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're more than merely prohibiting </v>

41
00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:08.540
<v Speaker 2>yourself from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from impulsive sin.</v>

42
00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Let's say there's a positive good to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplished.</v>

43
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.280
<v Speaker 2>While you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

44
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:14.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the positive good is.</v>

45
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

46
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.640
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is why this thing that I've said</v>

47
00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:21.680
<v Speaker 2>to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's become this crazy Internet meme,</v>

48
00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Speaker 2>but that's to clean up your room and </v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

49
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.410
<v Speaker 2>which is a lot better and more useful </v>
<v Speaker 2>than people think.</v>

50
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:29.480
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot harder to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing,</v>

51
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:30.950
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

52
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:35.951
<v Speaker 2>and I learned this in part from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn when he was trying to iron </v>

53
00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:38.651
<v Speaker 2>out his soul when he was in the Gulag </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was trying to figure out how </v>

54
00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:39.770
<v Speaker 2>we got there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how he contributed to how we got there.</v>

55
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not Stalin and Hitler even though they </v>

56
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.950
<v Speaker 2>were kind of to blame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

57
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:45.140
<v Speaker 2>but he wasn't much he could do about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

58
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.290
<v Speaker 2>I think what you have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is part of humility,</v>

59
00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:52.010
<v Speaker 2>is you have to look around you within </v>
<v Speaker 2>your sphere of influence,</v>

60
00:02:52.011 --> 00:02:57.011
<v Speaker 2>like the direct sphere of influence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fix the things that announced themselves</v>

61
00:02:57.291 --> 00:02:59.120
<v Speaker 2>as in need of repair.</v>

62
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.350
<v Speaker 2>And those are often small things you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know and they can be like your room,</v>

63
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.750
<v Speaker 2>put it in order because the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't exactly so important that your </v>

64
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 2>room is an order,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it is.</v>

65
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.540
<v Speaker 2>What's important is that you learn how </v>
<v Speaker 2>to distinguish between chaos and order </v>

66
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.040
<v Speaker 2>and to be able to act in a manner that </v>
<v Speaker 2>produces order.</v>

67
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.190
<v Speaker 2>And in most households there's 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that could be done to just make </v>

68
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.211
<v Speaker 2>it less hideous and horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so practicing that is a real useful </v>

69
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 2>form of meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's also,</v>

70
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a divine act because you're</v>

71
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 2>taking chaos and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you pay attention even to a room,</v>

72
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:38.040
<v Speaker 2>it's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I learned because I've,</v>

73
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 2>I've renovated many places now and tried</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make them beautiful.</v>

74
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:46.051
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that I've really </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned is that even if you own a </v>

75
00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:49.411
<v Speaker 2>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you investigated all the nooks </v>

76
00:03:49.411 --> 00:03:53.131
<v Speaker 2>and crannies and cleaned them up and put</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own imprint on them and made the </v>

77
00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 2>mirrors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not yours.</v>

78
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 2>The mere fact of physical ownership </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make them yours.</v>

79
00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:02.431
<v Speaker 2>You have to establish a dynamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with the objects before </v>

80
00:04:02.431 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 2>they're actually years and I think you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

81
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 2>You can do something as simple as just </v>
<v Speaker 2>sit on your bed and think,</v>

82
00:04:07.361 --> 00:04:12.361
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's probably like five things I </v>

83
00:04:12.361 --> 00:04:14.791
<v Speaker 2>could do today so that tomorrow morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>is slightly better than this morning was</v>

84
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:16.660
<v Speaker 2>at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least I'm not falling behind.</v>

85
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.170
<v Speaker 2>And those will usually be like heavy </v>
<v Speaker 2>data toad in the morning.</v>

86
00:04:20.171 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

87
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to be something you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

88
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 2>There'll be things you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>avoid.</v>

89
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.030
<v Speaker 2>There are snakes essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you ask yourself like you're </v>

90
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.280
<v Speaker 2>asking someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is a form of prayer,</v>

91
00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 2>if you ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of telling yourself,</v>

92
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it that I could do to set things</v>

93
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 2>more right today that I would actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>do?</v>

94
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 2>It's usually some small thing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not that disciplined,</v>

95
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:48.031
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you can go do it and then you put </v>

96
00:04:48.031 --> 00:04:51.160
<v Speaker 2>the world together a little more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you do that and that spreads out,</v>

97
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.580
<v Speaker 2>but you also put your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also construct yourself into </v>

98
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 2>something that's better able to call </v>
<v Speaker 2>order forth from chaos,</v>

99
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.980
<v Speaker 2>and that makes you just incrementally </v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger and then the next day you can </v>

100
00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:10.111
<v Speaker 2>maybe take on a slightly larger task and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you get the benefit of compound </v>

101
00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 2>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do that,</v>

102
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:15.961
<v Speaker 2>it's a tremendously powerful technique </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they think if you do that at some </v>

103
00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:20.251
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of just having to fix things up </v>

104
00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:23.760
<v Speaker 2>that are not good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll start to get a glimmer of the </v>

105
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 2>positive things that you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

106
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.270
<v Speaker 2>the positive things that you could do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would actually constitute a vision </v>

107
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 2>and that that's what I would recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

108
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.030
<v Speaker 3>Good night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
