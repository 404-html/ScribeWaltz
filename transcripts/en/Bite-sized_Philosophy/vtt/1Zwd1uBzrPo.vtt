00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Joanna says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some researchers see shame as something </v>

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.601
<v Speaker 1>that is very disruptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consensus seems to be that it is an </v>

3
00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:10.080
<v Speaker 1>emotion that is always disruptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you agree with this?</v>

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.820
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's absolutely ridiculous.</v>

5
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:16.821
<v Speaker 1>And only modern psychologists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably social psychologists would be </v>

6
00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:20.770
<v Speaker 1>foolish enough to even dare deposit </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense something so absolutely observed.</v>

7
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Psychopathy and shamelessness are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>So shame isn't shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No emotion is always destructive.</v>

9
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Any emotion taken to an extreme can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>disruptive,</v>

10
00:00:35.491 --> 00:00:37.990
<v Speaker 1>just like any value taken to an extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.250
<v Speaker 1>made into one thing can be destructive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

12
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joy can be destructive.</v>

13
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are manic are in some sense </v>

14
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>possessed by a radical excess of </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion and they,</v>

15
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.100
<v Speaker 1>they get incredibly impulsive and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's terribly destructive.</v>

16
00:00:55.201 --> 00:01:00.201
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's almost no form of insanity </v>

17
00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:02.511
<v Speaker 1>that's more destructive than mania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will go out and spend all their </v>

18
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:06.081
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all their family's money and well and </v>

19
00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:09.951
<v Speaker 1>engage in all sorts of hyper optimistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions with the world.</v>

20
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 1>It will result in their complete rude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

21
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think of happiness as an </v>

22
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.930
<v Speaker 1>untrammeled positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

23
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>if you think of happiness as positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>

24
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.300
<v Speaker 1>which is partly true because it's also </v>
<v Speaker 1>the absence of negative emotion.</v>

25
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.760
<v Speaker 1>If you think of happiness as only a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

26
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.790
<v Speaker 1>then you have no idea about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologies of positive emotion and </v>

27
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.870
<v Speaker 1>their manifold and shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you do something stupid and</v>

28
00:01:33.871 --> 00:01:38.871
<v Speaker 1>destructive to yourself or to yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the broader social community,</v>

29
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.840
<v Speaker 1>you should feel shame and you should pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to it and you should learn </v>

30
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.110
<v Speaker 1>from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're not capable of doing that,</v>

31
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>that then people should stay the hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>away from you because you're shameless,</v>

32
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>and of course for most of western </v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

33
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:58.401
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know enough about other </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of history to also make the same </v>

34
00:01:58.401 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 1>comment to call someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shameless was,</v>

35
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a tremendous insult.</v>

36
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:06.141
<v Speaker 1>It meant that they didn't have enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense to be appalled by their own </v>

37
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:09.620
<v Speaker 1>pathology and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just not a good thing at all.</v>
