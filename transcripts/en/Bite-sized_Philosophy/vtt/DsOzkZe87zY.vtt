1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this or not,</v>

2
00:00:02.261 --> 00:00:04.950
<v Speaker 1>but chimps basically go to war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Jane Goodall discovered that a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>decades ago and it really,</v>

4
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>really was hard on her because she was </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a ruse soliah.</v>

5
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>So for those of you don't know John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Jacques Rousseau is a French </v>

6
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.390
<v Speaker 1>philosopher and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French philosophers have a lawful lot of</v>

7
00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>sins on their conscience and of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>

8
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.030
<v Speaker 1>So it was certainly one of them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russell was the first,</v>

9
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>like what fully articulate promoter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that human beings were </v>

10
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.740
<v Speaker 1>basically good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know we had a good soul in a moral</v>

11
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:37.741
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we were corrupted by our social </v>

12
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:37.741
<v Speaker 1>institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.560
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.410
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:41.411 --> 00:00:44.710
<v Speaker 1>as far as Russo was concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of a noble savage idea,</v>

16
00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:49.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the human being in their raw form </v>

17
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:49.711
<v Speaker 1>has a pure soul and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

18
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:51.550
<v Speaker 1>you give them to parents and you'd give </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to teachers and you know,</v>

19
00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:56.551
<v Speaker 1>they'd get into politics and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>group disputes and then they get all </v>

20
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:56.551
<v Speaker 1>corrupted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:58.210
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:58.211 --> 00:01:00.010
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know even what to say about that</v>

23
00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 1>except that it's absolutely moronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>keynote,</v>

24
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an appealing proposition if you're </v>

25
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 1>naive optimist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

26
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.561
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't explain where malevolence </v>

27
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:10.930
<v Speaker 1>comes from because the people created </v>
<v Speaker 1>the institution.</v>

28
00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:11.650
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:11.651 --> 00:01:16.651
<v Speaker 1>it just puts you into an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 1>regress chicken and egg if the </v>

30
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:20.371
<v Speaker 1>institutions are reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people who built them aren't </v>

31
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:23.731
<v Speaker 1>then where did the reprehensible </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements that the institutions come </v>

32
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:23.731
<v Speaker 1>from?</v>

33
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might think it's an audio generating </v>

34
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 1>consequences of organizing people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

35
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.471
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty specious theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm of course he had a counterpart of</v>

36
00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:36.601
<v Speaker 1>philosophical counterpart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Hobbs and Hobbs said basically </v>

37
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:36.601
<v Speaker 1>exactly the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

38
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>people were vicious and cruel unless you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like put them in straight jackets </v>

39
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.201
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally and made them obey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then everything was going to go </v>

40
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:46.810
<v Speaker 1>immediately to help you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

41
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.780
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you saw what happened in Iran after</v>

42
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:52.680
<v Speaker 1>the Americans walled stand in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power structure disintegrated.</v>

43
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what was a hell of a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>more like than it was like Russell,</v>

44
00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You took out the tyrant at the top and </v>

45
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.480
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like everybody got all </v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful and loving.</v>

46
00:02:01.481 --> 00:02:03.910
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden it was like absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos reigned.</v>

47
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.000
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you can rationalize that.</v>

48
00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roost.</v>

49
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:13.251
<v Speaker 1>So by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had five children by illiterate made </v>

50
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:18.030
<v Speaker 1>that that was as Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you put every single one of them in </v>

51
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.140
<v Speaker 1>orphanages where of course they perished</v>
<v Speaker 1>because orphanages have Russo's times.</v>

52
00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:21.830
<v Speaker 1>We're not exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.970
<v Speaker 1>a luxury resort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even up until the beginning of the </v>

54
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:27.610
<v Speaker 1>20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most children who are under one years of</v>

55
00:02:27.611 --> 00:02:32.230
<v Speaker 1>age who were in care institutions died </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly disease.</v>

56
00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:37.231
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but often because they just weren't </v>

57
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:37.231
<v Speaker 1>touched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't cared for physically.</v>

58
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Even if they were fed and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 years ago they weren't even fed</v>

59
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.700
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

60
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:44.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nonetheless,</v>

61
00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:45.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have people</v>

62
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.300
<v Speaker 1>maintain the optimistic idea that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings were basically good and that they</v>

63
00:02:52.301 --> 00:02:55.210
<v Speaker 1>were corrupted by institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a common idea among.</v>

64
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a very common idea in </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities,</v>

65
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because university people are always </v>

66
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>complaining about the corrupt nature of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this institution and that institution,</v>

67
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they sit here in the warm with the</v>

68
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>electricity on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.250
<v Speaker 1>it's surrounded by wealth that </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterizes maybe one 10th of one </v>

70
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 1>percent of the entire world's </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

71
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:19.711
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they complained about how we'll press </v>

72
00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:19.711
<v Speaker 1>they are and how will we know nasty the </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions are.</v>

73
00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

74
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>well you actually haven't been to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty institution,</v>

75
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause nasty institutions.</v>

76
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:29.551
<v Speaker 1>They get pretty damn bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most of the institutions in the </v>

77
00:03:29.551 --> 00:03:32.641
<v Speaker 1>world are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't exactly clear that people </v>

78
00:03:32.641 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>are pristine in their heart and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupted by institutions.</v>

79
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Although I'm sure that happens patent </v>
<v Speaker 1>depends around,</v>

80
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

81
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 1>this has been a line of philosophical </v>
<v Speaker 1>speculation.</v>

82
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:44.350
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

83
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.380
<v Speaker 1>that's I would say constituted one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unspoken fundamental assumptions of,</v>

84
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 1>of Western intellectuals in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Jane Goodall thought,</v>

85
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many ways the same way she thought </v>

86
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.850
<v Speaker 1>chimps were basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>they're just animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are okay.</v>

88
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:04.171
<v Speaker 1>They exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coexist relatively peacefully with one </v>

89
00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:04.171
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:04.790
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

91
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Carl Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I talk about a bit in my personality</v>

92
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:12.480
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>he basically thought that people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally good and that institutions</v>

94
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:17.220
<v Speaker 1>make them bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

95
00:04:17.221 --> 00:04:22.221
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is you look at chimps and </v>

96
00:04:22.221 --> 00:04:22.221
<v Speaker 1>narrow a fair bit like us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:04:22.221 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Bonobos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look at them too,</v>

98
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:28.021
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're genetically quite related to us </v>

99
00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:28.021
<v Speaker 1>and they're quite a bit different than </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>

100
00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:31.921
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're sort of a weird mixture of the </v>

101
00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:31.921
<v Speaker 1>two in some sense.</v>

102
00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:31.921
<v Speaker 1>But Champs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those things,</v>

103
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.380
<v Speaker 1>there is no evidence that they really </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any internal control over their </v>

104
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.020
<v Speaker 1>regression at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

105
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.080
<v Speaker 1>there was a horrible case about two </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago where a woman was interacting </v>

106
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>with the chimp and it tore her to pieces</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can do that.</v>

107
00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Man took her face right off and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the strength of about six men,</v>

108
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.730
<v Speaker 1>like an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>

109
00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an adult.</v>

110
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 1>Male chimp can break a 300 pound test </v>
<v Speaker 1>cable,</v>

111
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things are really,</v>

112
00:04:56.111 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 1>really strong and they are not friendly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in Arnhem Zoo for example,</v>

114
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.470
<v Speaker 1>there's been a troop of chimps there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have been followed by an extremely </v>

115
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:14.791
<v Speaker 1>brilliant apartment hall and just named </v>
<v Speaker 1>Frans de Waal who's work I would very </v>

116
00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:18.211
<v Speaker 1>highly recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Wall is a very smart guy and he's </v>

117
00:05:18.211 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>looked at the origins of morality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzees,</v>

118
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a biological perspective,</v>

119
00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very nice work.</v>

120
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.600
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very clearheaded.</v>

121
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.990
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's recounted absolutely horrific </v>

122
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.920
<v Speaker 1>stories of chimpanzee behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the stories he talked about,</v>

123
00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

124
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you kind of have this idea that </v>

125
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.330
<v Speaker 1>there's a mail chimp hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's roughly true.</v>

126
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.411
<v Speaker 1>There's a female hierarchy too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the males and the chimp world </v>

127
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:40.450
<v Speaker 1>anyways tend to be the dominant ones and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:43.390
<v Speaker 1>you kind of think of a dominant primate </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a prize fighter,</v>

129
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:48.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much he's ruling because of his </v>

130
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:51.391
<v Speaker 1>physical prowess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that turns out not to exactly be </v>

131
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:52.240
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in this particular case,</v>

132
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:57.241
<v Speaker 1>the guy who was running the chimp troop </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a bit of a bully and he wasn't very </v>

133
00:05:57.241 --> 00:05:57.241
<v Speaker 1>good at making friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

134
00:05:57.241 --> 00:06:02.081
<v Speaker 1>and that's not such a good idea because </v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how tough you are by yourself </v>

135
00:06:02.081 --> 00:06:02.480
<v Speaker 1>to weaker guys can probably take you </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

136
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happened during friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>to was observations and two chimps </v>

137
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 1>attack the leader and they had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>coalition.</v>

138
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:10.690
<v Speaker 1>They were grooming each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They repels,</v>

139
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in chimps are pretty good at remembering</v>

140
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 1>like risk reciprocal relationships and </v>
<v Speaker 1>having friendships really.</v>

141
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Like they have a very highly social </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>

142
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just tore him apart.</v>

143
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:22.400
<v Speaker 1>Like the things they did to him like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even want to talk about.</v>

144
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.730
<v Speaker 1>And so chimps have really no upper limit</v>
<v Speaker 1>on their capacity for aggression and </v>

145
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:28.310
<v Speaker 1>when they hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because chimps,</v>

146
00:06:28.311 --> 00:06:33.311
<v Speaker 1>Honda and they liked me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they often call us monkeys and they </v>

147
00:06:33.311 --> 00:06:33.600
<v Speaker 1>weigh about 35 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a cola.</v>

148
00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:36.890
<v Speaker 1>This monkeys a major league animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they eat those things alive and they</v>

149
00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:41.891
<v Speaker 1>scream while they're being killed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that does not slow the chimps down one </v>

150
00:06:41.891 --> 00:06:44.891
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not obvious that the chimp is </v>

151
00:06:44.891 --> 00:06:45.740
<v Speaker 1>really a creature of a lot of empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the males.</v>

152
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.950
<v Speaker 1>The females are likely more empathic </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have to deal with infants </v>

153
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.071
<v Speaker 1>for longer periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What seems to inhibit the aggression of </v>

154
00:06:54.071 --> 00:06:56.360
<v Speaker 1>mail chimp's isn't anything they hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>internally.</v>

155
00:06:56.361 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 1>It seems that when they get hyper </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive in the truth,</v>

156
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:02.030
<v Speaker 1>the truth gets more and more agitated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and basically shuts them down.</v>

157
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.590
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine maybe you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rough bar and some Dingbat who was,</v>

158
00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:10.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half psychopathic and has had two pints </v>

159
00:07:10.591 --> 00:07:13.391
<v Speaker 1>of alcohol is starting to cause a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of trouble and he's </v>

160
00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:14.780
<v Speaker 1>not going to shut himself down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the rest of the truth might.</v>

161
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 1>And that kind of means that the control </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the aggression is externalized.</v>

162
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not a consequence of super ego </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

163
00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:24.920
<v Speaker 1>And we like to think that we actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>control our own aggression,</v>

164
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not so sure about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

165
00:07:27.591 --> 00:07:30.230
<v Speaker 1>if you read things like there's a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

166
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.310
<v Speaker 1>Horrifying Book published about 20 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago called the rape of Nanking,</v>

167
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:37.160
<v Speaker 1>which is while the woman who wrote it </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed suicide.</v>

168
00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.550
<v Speaker 1>So that sort of suffices to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the rape of Nanking is about.</v>

169
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:45.551
<v Speaker 1>And it's a story about the Japanese in </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War II going into a Chinese kid </v>

170
00:07:45.551 --> 00:07:48.410
<v Speaker 1>city called Nan King where I believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 350,000</v>

171
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:53.411
<v Speaker 1>people were killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Nazis in that story where the </v>

172
00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:53.780
<v Speaker 1>good guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine the kind of brutality</v>

173
00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:58.781
<v Speaker 1>that might be occurring there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's absolutely perfectly well </v>

174
00:07:58.781 --> 00:08:02.831
<v Speaker 1>documented evidence suggesting that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese soldiers engaged in competitive</v>

175
00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:04.540
<v Speaker 1>brutality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

176
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:09.580
<v Speaker 1>And so really what happened was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese had been pretty militarized by </v>

177
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.481
<v Speaker 1>World War Two and native adopted a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Prussian education system and the </v>

178
00:08:13.481 --> 00:08:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Russians and Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.250
<v Speaker 1>pre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pre 20th century Germans,</v>

180
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.500
<v Speaker 1>they were basically interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>educating obedient soldiers,</v>

181
00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:26.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was a militaristic culture </v>

182
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.451
<v Speaker 1>and the Japanese kind of adopted that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were sick of being kicked </v>

183
00:08:28.451 --> 00:08:31.211
<v Speaker 1>around by the Europeans and pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully because they defeated the </v>

184
00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:31.211
<v Speaker 1>Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:33.120
<v Speaker 1>in the early stages of Roe or of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>

186
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.970
<v Speaker 1>It was quite a shock to everyone in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe and,</v>

187
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause for great celebration in Japan and</v>

188
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:38.690
<v Speaker 1>no wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

189
00:08:38.691 --> 00:08:42.110
<v Speaker 1>they militarize the hell out of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>young men and taught them basically that</v>

190
00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:44.270
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese were a master race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

191
00:08:44.271 --> 00:08:49.271
<v Speaker 1>and that other people were sub humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very common human way of </v>

192
00:08:49.271 --> 00:08:49.271
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

193
00:08:49.271 --> 00:08:54.010
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's really the default way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that human tribes think about other </v>

194
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.180
<v Speaker 1>tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You what?</v>

195
00:08:55.181 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little more complicated than that</v>

196
00:08:57.091 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 1>because human tribes tend to trade with </v>
<v Speaker 1>other tribes.</v>

197
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's not all demonization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of it is,</v>

198
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:08.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you look around the world in the </v>

199
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:09.750
<v Speaker 1>anthropological literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you see is that the names that most</v>

200
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:12.330
<v Speaker 1>tribes have for themselves is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

201
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:17.331
<v Speaker 1>human beings or the people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicating that the rest of the people </v>

202
00:09:17.331 --> 00:09:18.030
<v Speaker 1>are reading people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only leader,</v>

203
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:23.031
<v Speaker 1>barbarians or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live out where the sun is being </v>

204
00:09:23.031 --> 00:09:23.520
<v Speaker 1>eaten by the dragon of the night or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

205
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word barbarian is a,</v>

206
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.910
<v Speaker 1>is a word that comes from the Greeks </v>
<v Speaker 1>making fun of how non-greek spoke.</v>

207
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Know they thought they were bar bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bar,</v>

208
00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bar,</v>

209
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.790
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

210
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:38.400
<v Speaker 1>what goodall phone was the chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chimp,</v>

211
00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:43.401
<v Speaker 1>adolescence in particular in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the males would patrol the borders of </v>

212
00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:45.360
<v Speaker 1>their territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

213
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.750
<v Speaker 1>in groups of three or four and with </v>
<v Speaker 1>often with a female or two.</v>

214
00:09:48.751 --> 00:09:50.790
<v Speaker 1>But the females didn't seem to be really</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

215
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

216
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:57.650
<v Speaker 1>they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were more part of the group rather </v>

217
00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.261
<v Speaker 1>than the initiators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what the chimps would do is if they </v>

218
00:10:00.261 --> 00:10:03.021
<v Speaker 1>found a chimp from another troop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if that was a chimp that had moved </v>

219
00:10:03.021 --> 00:10:05.520
<v Speaker 1>from their troop in the not too distant </v>
<v Speaker 1>past and joined another,</v>

220
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.190
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes the males leave and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they go to other troops.</v>

221
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:13.430
<v Speaker 1>If they are numbered them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would tear them to pieces and it </v>

222
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.210
<v Speaker 1>looked like that's why they were doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the border patrol.</v>

223
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.540
<v Speaker 1>They're out looking for trouble there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gangs roughly speaking,</v>

224
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:20.820
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point of it is is that,</v>

225
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.570
<v Speaker 1>and they would only attack if they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers because chimps can.</v>

226
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:29.990
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say they count,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have a rudimentary notion of </v>

227
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.020
<v Speaker 1>group size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

228
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can count without </v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to verbalize,</v>

229
00:10:33.841 --> 00:10:36.480
<v Speaker 1>but you can estimate at a glance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

230
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I mean,</v>

231
00:10:37.891 --> 00:10:40.200
<v Speaker 1>when I say tear apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what I mean.</v>

232
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:45.260
<v Speaker 1>There's no upper limit on the brutality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so good all discovered that first.</v>

233
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.780
<v Speaker 1>And she didn't tell anybody above it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now she had a reasons.</v>

234
00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean some of them I think radiological</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the lovely chimps,</v>

235
00:10:51.691 --> 00:10:53.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fair enough.</v>

236
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:58.170
<v Speaker 1>But some of it was also she thought that</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the chimps had been corrupted as a</v>

237
00:10:58.171 --> 00:11:03.171
<v Speaker 1>consequence of their contact with human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings and that their natural behavior </v>

238
00:11:03.171 --> 00:11:03.630
<v Speaker 1>had been somehow transform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

239
00:11:03.631 --> 00:11:06.570
<v Speaker 1>and that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonable to be cautious if you're</v>

240
00:11:06.571 --> 00:11:08.220
<v Speaker 1>a scientist before you go out and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

241
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.620
<v Speaker 1>chimps go to war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that revolutionary?</v>

242
00:11:10.621 --> 00:11:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Because it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

243
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Because it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just ends.</v>

244
00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 1>The idea that our war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like and malevolent nature is a function</v>

245
00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:20.160
<v Speaker 1>of culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if chimps do it well,</v>

246
00:11:20.161 --> 00:11:21.900
<v Speaker 1>what are they perverted by their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture?</v>

247
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

248
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:28.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are more and less violent </v>
<v Speaker 1>chimp cultures and there are more and </v>

249
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.740
<v Speaker 1>less violent baboons culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was some cultural variation,</v>

250
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:36.770
<v Speaker 1>but since goodall's time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of behavior is being </v>

251
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:37.290
<v Speaker 1>documented on many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many chimp truths.</v>

252
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.870
<v Speaker 1>So that's us in a nutshell.</v>
