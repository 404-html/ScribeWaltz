1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.740
<v Speaker 1>The only people who now get married are </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are relatively wealthy.</v>

2
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.530
<v Speaker 1>You know the fact that we've disrupted </v>
<v Speaker 1>the structure of marriage as an </v>

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.791
<v Speaker 1>institution since about 1965 say what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's meant what that has meant is that</v>

4
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 1>it's its benefits are now only available</v>
<v Speaker 1>to people who are privileged so you can </v>

5
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:23.340
<v Speaker 1>look up the Stout's yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're middle class and above the</v>

6
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:28.341
<v Speaker 1>divorce rates haven't moved much since </v>
<v Speaker 1>the early 70s if you're working class </v>

7
00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:34.181
<v Speaker 1>and below it's a complete catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that's meant is that most meant</v>

8
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.490
<v Speaker 1>many children who are in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rougher socioeconomic straits are being </v>

9
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:45.251
<v Speaker 1>raised by a single person who has </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely and 100 percent overwhelmed </v>

10
00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:50.141
<v Speaker 1>by their multiple commitments right full</v>
<v Speaker 1>time responsibility for children and </v>

11
00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:55.361
<v Speaker 1>generally in employment in </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily dismal low paying </v>

12
00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:59.860
<v Speaker 1>unstable and exploitative job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to me if you if you're like you guys </v>

13
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:05.471
<v Speaker 1>are you're all going to be middle class </v>
<v Speaker 1>or above in all likelihood it's like </v>

14
00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:08.141
<v Speaker 1>it's fine for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to make a bloody bit of </v>

15
00:01:08.141 --> 00:01:08.141
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All things considered but for people who</v>

16
00:01:08.141 --> 00:01:11.660
<v Speaker 1>are poor it's just been a catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

17
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

18
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh well there's all sorts of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean first of all it's become socially</v>

19
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:29.260
<v Speaker 1>acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

20
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Divorce wasn't socially acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can say well that's that was </v>

21
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.490
<v Speaker 1>pretty hard on people who wanted to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>divorced.</v>

22
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like yeah obviously any rule is </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard on people that break it but that </v>

23
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.390
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean that there shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules you know.</v>

24
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Now what rules there should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole different issue.</v>

25
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Out of wedlock child birth has become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>norm.</v>

26
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 2>It was absolutely rare in the 90s in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>early 1960s vanishingly rare.</v>

27
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.200
<v Speaker 2>And that's become it's it's acceptable </v>
<v Speaker 2>even though all the evidence suggests </v>

28
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 2>like if you actually look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence it's absolutely clear that kids</v>

29
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:06.440
<v Speaker 2>who have two parents do better than kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have one.</v>

30
00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.110
<v Speaker 2>Now you know people when you tell people</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they'll tell you an anecdote about </v>

31
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.801
<v Speaker 2>someone they knew maybe their own parent</v>
<v Speaker 2>who did a wonderful job of raising them </v>

32
00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:17.760
<v Speaker 2>as a single person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the anecdotes are irrelevant.</v>

33
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.250
<v Speaker 2>What's relevant is the bulk of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence.</v>

34
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 2>Of course there are situations where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are better apart than together.</v>

35
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.080
<v Speaker 2>And of course there are situations where</v>
<v Speaker 2>one person can do a better job than two </v>

36
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.801
<v Speaker 2>people who are at each other's throats </v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's aggregate it's aggregating </v>

37
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:39.001
<v Speaker 2>examples that you use when you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>a scientific survey and the results of </v>

38
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 2>those surveys are crystal clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the other thing that's going to</v>

39
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:45.981
<v Speaker 2>happen it's going to happen very soon is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there is going to be a very very </v>

40
00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:48.810
<v Speaker 2>very very large number of elderly </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

41
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Who are low and.</v>

42
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>B and elderly and a loan like no family </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is not something you want to look </v>

43
00:02:57.771 --> 00:03:00.620
<v Speaker 1>forward to especially when you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that you're going to be elderly</v>

44
00:03:00.621 --> 00:03:05.621
<v Speaker 1>for like 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know because say say it starts </v>

45
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 1>around 65.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how long you guys are going</v>

46
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:13.051
<v Speaker 1>to live but it's probably 95 is not an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable estimate and it might be </v>

47
00:03:13.051 --> 00:03:17.701
<v Speaker 1>longer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because you know we're adding about </v>

48
00:03:17.701 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 1>three months to the total lifespan every</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

49
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the rate of technological </v>

50
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>improvement in relationship to overall </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality.</v>

51
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.720
<v Speaker 1>So you know and that the degree to which</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're adding that extra.</v>

52
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 1>LifeSpan is increasing each year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know and it may hit yet to the point</v>

53
00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:38.900
<v Speaker 1>where we're increasing lifespan a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>every year.</v>

54
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.030
<v Speaker 1>Now I doubt it because it probably is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will probably be in a asymptote but.</v>

55
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.240
<v Speaker 1>It has been increasing for a very long </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time.</v>

56
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.690
<v Speaker 1>So you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing to think about the </v>

57
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.090
<v Speaker 1>maximization of day to day freedom when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're between say 15.</v>

58
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.470
<v Speaker 1>And 40 45 after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole different story.</v>

59
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.830
<v Speaker 1>And but modern people never think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last half of their life.</v>

60
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.770
<v Speaker 1>No soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why.</v>

61
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know but maybe they're afraid to</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>
