WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the West is powerful.</v>

2
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:08.571
<v Speaker 1>I would say like we have a really well </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed mythology of the exploratory </v>

3
00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 1>hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but where we're not so well developed is</v>

4
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>the second part because in the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the classic Hero's story,</v>

5
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:17.631
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to come back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate about what you found and so </v>

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.240
<v Speaker 1>there's a individual exploration element</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a communicate and </v>

7
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.410
<v Speaker 1>update the culture element and both of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those are equally important and it's </v>

8
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.150
<v Speaker 1>something that we don't do well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have much respect for tradition</v>

9
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:35.151
<v Speaker 1>in the west and it's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really big problem because the ethical </v>

10
00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:39.090
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of a human being is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the dead culture so that's the dead</v>

11
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:44.091
<v Speaker 1>father or the Dad God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to revivify it with attention and </v>

12
00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>communication and you've failed to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

13
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Then everything disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we we are failing to do that.</v>

14
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>We're leaving it all behind instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good idea.</v>

15
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the old gods die,</v>

16
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>as Nietzsche said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had new gods swoop in very rapidly,</v>

17
00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:04.770
<v Speaker 1>and if you think the old guard was bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wait until the new gods get ahold of</v>

18
00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:09.771
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while we saw what happened in the </v>

19
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:09.771
<v Speaker 1>20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

20
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:14.601
<v Speaker 1>with all the ideologies that sprang up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the absence of classical religious </v>

21
00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:14.601
<v Speaker 1>belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

22
00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not so thrilled with Catholicism.</v>

23
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:18.410
<v Speaker 1>If you think about that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental tradition of the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>with the witch burnings and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inquisition and all that,</v>

26
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

27
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:28.821
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well get a load of the Nazis and then </v>

28
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:28.821
<v Speaker 1>see what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

29
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:32.780
<v Speaker 1>or the communists for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like from bad to worse in an </v>

30
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>unimaginable way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.690
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's partly because those archaic </v>

32
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.300
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are religious systems,</v>

33
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:43.440
<v Speaker 1>they weren't ideologies.</v>

34
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.440
<v Speaker 1>There are a whole different class of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and we don't understand them very </v>

35
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>well and it's not good because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot live without understanding them.</v>

36
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.360
<v Speaker 1>You don't know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you fall prey to weird mental </v>

37
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>diseases like nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one.</v>

38
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Another one is ideological possession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you become a totalitarian or an </v>

39
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 1>analyst and that's a bad outcome and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might think,</v>

40
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the alternative?</v>

41
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what happens in Pinocchio,</v>

42
00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:10.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've watched Pinocchio.</v>

43
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often show up in oak you to this </v>

44
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.410
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if I'm going to do that</v>

45
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.410
<v Speaker 1>this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

46
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.930
<v Speaker 1>but now he's a puppet marionette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone else's pulling his strings has,</v>

47
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not very bright.</v>

48
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>He hasn't banged around the world at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

49
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.340
<v Speaker 1>He's not a good father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old Japan who really would rather </v>

50
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.340
<v Speaker 1>that he was a real boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

51
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.300
<v Speaker 1>A real person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's the kind of father that wants to</v>

52
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>produce an individual and not a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

53
00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>in his workshop it's all friendly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a nice fire and he's making toys</v>

55
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:40.100
<v Speaker 1>and there's lots of music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like go Japan.</v>

56
00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a good guy.</v>

57
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.810
<v Speaker 1>So it makes this little puppet and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>sends them out in the world,</v>

58
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go be a real boy.</v>

59
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio runs into a whole class of </v>

60
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:51.300
<v Speaker 1>different obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is evil,</v>

61
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

62
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the coachman.</v>

63
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.690
<v Speaker 1>And the Italian stereotype guy who makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>him a dancing puppets celebrity,</v>

64
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>which I think is pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really prescient,</v>

65
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you might think,</v>

66
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:11.551
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the goal of your typical bone </v>

67
00:03:11.551 --> 00:03:11.551
<v Speaker 1>headed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

68
00:03:11.551 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>mid adolescent in North America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like unearned celebrity.</v>

69
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Well that's exactly what Pinocchio goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>for first and that doesn't work out so </v>

70
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>well because he ends up with slave.</v>

71
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.930
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing that happens is </v>
<v Speaker 1>he capitalizes on the fact that he's </v>

72
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.911
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable and pretends he's sick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes off for a vacation under the </v>

73
00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:33.001
<v Speaker 1>direction of the coachman who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically Satan in disguise and it goes </v>

74
00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>out to treasure island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure island,</v>

75
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>and meets all the delinquent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're just like Nazis.</v>

76
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:41.560
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole ploy is to enslave everyone to</v>

77
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 1>deprive them of their voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the donkey's brain.</v>

78
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 1>And to make them into slaves pretty damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrifying.</v>

79
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:52.741
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that movie came out about the same time </v>

80
00:03:52.741 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 1>that the Nazis were really grasping </v>
<v Speaker 1>power in,</v>

81
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>in central Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they got it exactly right.</v>

82
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's really going on behind the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes.</v>

83
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.960
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens?</v>

84
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:06.961
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio turns halfway into a brain </v>

85
00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:09.091
<v Speaker 1>donkey because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gone off the path and in order to </v>

86
00:04:09.091 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>get back on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he tries to go home,</v>

87
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 1>but it's too late.</v>

88
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 1>He's grown up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't go home.</v>

89
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 1>He's not a kid anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goes home and dad,</v>

90
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:16.060
<v Speaker 1>isn't there surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise,</v>

91
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 1>because once you grow up and you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>

92
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 1>dad isn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just another human being.</v>

93
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.150
<v Speaker 1>So then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then he has to go into the ocean.</v>

94
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Now that's particularly weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

95
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like there he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half donkey.</v>

96
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:33.661
<v Speaker 1>He's a puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dove comes down and drops him a </v>

97
00:04:33.661 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 1>message from God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Holy Spirit descending,</v>

98
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:37.990
<v Speaker 1>except it's actually from the blue fairy</v>
<v Speaker 1>weirdly enough.</v>

99
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.620
<v Speaker 1>And the message says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to go to the deepest part of </v>

100
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.620
<v Speaker 1>the ocean and rescue your father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

101
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is what you have to do.</v>

102
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:47.530
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want to be a bloody puppet </v>
<v Speaker 1>donkey,</v>

103
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.040
<v Speaker 1>you have to go down into the depths and </v>
<v Speaker 1>find your dead father and you have to </v>

104
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.160
<v Speaker 1>revivify him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happened.</v>

105
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.050
<v Speaker 1>So Pinocchio goes way down there to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>deepest depths and finds monster who's a</v>

106
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.840
<v Speaker 1>monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So terrible that the fish swim away just</v>

107
00:05:01.841 --> 00:05:03.880
<v Speaker 1>at the sound of his voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>

108
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.190
<v Speaker 1>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

109
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.960
<v Speaker 1>he who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

110
00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:09.880
<v Speaker 1>you shall not be named Voldemort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

111
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:13.120
<v Speaker 1>You can't even say his damn name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same with monster.</v>

112
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Put Ohio goes down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes into the whale.</v>

113
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.840
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan?</v>

114
00:05:18.841 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says there's no getting out with this.</v>

115
00:05:20.951 --> 00:05:25.951
<v Speaker 1>There's no getting out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just have to sit here and Cook Fish </v>

116
00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:28.621
<v Speaker 1>and Pinocchio Thinks Cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he starts breaking up all the </v>

117
00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:29.660
<v Speaker 1>chairs and everything and his father </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking out.</v>

118
00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:30.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

119
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Breaking all these chairs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to sit on?</v>

120
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.620
<v Speaker 1>And then Pinocchio Lights them on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a master of fire.</v>

121
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:39.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a shamonic ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he is a master of fire.</v>

122
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.680
<v Speaker 1>That's what human being as he.</v>

123
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 1>He gets everything burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

124
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Jupiter pedals all freaked out about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because what are they going to sit </v>

125
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>An Pinocchio?</v>

126
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares about setting?</v>

127
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 1>We're going to solve the problem once </v>
<v Speaker 1>and for all.</v>

128
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 1>And so then the whale turns into a fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing driving,</v>

129
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:56.410
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty damn weird thing for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whale to do.</v>

130
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.520
<v Speaker 1>Half Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lived,</v>

131
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>washes up on shore dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he saves his father.</v>

132
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 1>Then at the very end of the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's lying on his bed,</v>

133
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.810
<v Speaker 1>all drowned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all like having a show.</v>

134
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 1>He's a dead pop it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

135
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:10.110
<v Speaker 1>do you want to be alive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Popular?</v>

136
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.480
<v Speaker 1>A dead puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

137
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:13.840
<v Speaker 1>maybe the dead puppet is better than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>life puppet.</v>

138
00:06:13.841 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 1>It depends on where you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then he's on the bed,</v>

139
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 1>the blue fairy comes down and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

140
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 1>you've been honest and courageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>

141
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Now you're real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

142
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>And then they have a little party and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

143
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 1>that's just exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>

144
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.180
<v Speaker 1>So that's how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the hero mythology is the</v>

145
00:06:32.181 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 1>rescuing of the father after rescue the </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

146
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise you're a corpse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're a historical creature.</v>

147
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.510
<v Speaker 1>You're a cultural creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a,</v>

148
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.800
<v Speaker 1>you cannot live without your culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think you can,</v>

149
00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:56.801
<v Speaker 1>but you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It disappears in and you don't even </v>

150
00:06:56.801 --> 00:07:00.250
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example in the </v>

151
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.531
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamian creation myth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm going to tell you about next </v>

152
00:07:02.531 --> 00:07:05.320
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that happens is that </v>

153
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.830
<v Speaker 1>the first round of gods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're like primordial forces.</v>

154
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:12.100
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty damn careless and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed their father and they make this </v>

155
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.060
<v Speaker 1>place to live on his corpse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

156
00:07:14.061 --> 00:07:19.061
<v Speaker 1>That's where we live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live on the corpse of our ancestors </v>

157
00:07:19.061 --> 00:07:20.230
<v Speaker 1>because we live in this society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dad,</v>

158
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 1>it's the product of dead people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's gotten his ged element,</v>

159
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 1>but we're living on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

160
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.170
<v Speaker 1>There are very careless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kill it.</v>

161
00:07:27.171 --> 00:07:28.250
<v Speaker 1>They sold it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they leave,</v>

162
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.230
<v Speaker 1>render it completely dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

163
00:07:30.231 --> 00:07:33.560
<v Speaker 1>what happens is tire Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the mother of chaos,</v>

164
00:07:33.561 --> 00:07:35.960
<v Speaker 1>she comes flooding back and she thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

165
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:38.090
<v Speaker 1>you killed the thing that protects you.</v>

166
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.240
<v Speaker 1>You just wait to see what happens and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly.</v>

167
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Yet you killed the thing that structures</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

168
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.560
<v Speaker 1>You will know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like niches,</v>

169
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.800
<v Speaker 1>prediction from the death of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you killed this.</v>

170
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.900
<v Speaker 1>You think are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any difference.</v>

171
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:51.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ha,</v>

172
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:57.130
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the striders protecting the </v>

173
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.491
<v Speaker 1>hobbits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get rid of that thing that protects </v>

174
00:08:00.491 --> 00:08:00.491
<v Speaker 1>you in chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes flooding in and you like.</v>

175
00:08:00.491 --> 00:08:02.990
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea what's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do though,</v>

176
00:08:02.991 --> 00:08:04.550
<v Speaker 1>because we lived through the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

177
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.370
<v Speaker 1>we know exactly what's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

178
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:10.400
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions of unnecessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths.</v>

179
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.640
<v Speaker 1>That's what's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're lucky we didn't blow the whole </v>

180
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:15.640
<v Speaker 1>damn thing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when we still could,</v>

181
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.710
<v Speaker 1>so people pursuing their dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>etiologies.</v>

182
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 1>You don't rescue the dead father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the puppet of death.</v>

183
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:26.330
<v Speaker 1>That's what you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On that cheery note.</v>
