1
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.860
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to think about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story of Sodom and Gomorrah in </v>

2
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.910
<v Speaker 1>relationship to modern sexual confusion,</v>

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.710
<v Speaker 1>so this is what I see happening on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice front,</v>

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.630
<v Speaker 1>let's say on the one hand since the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties and probably as a consequence of</v>

5
00:00:17.631 --> 00:00:20.330
<v Speaker 1>the birth control pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other factors as well.</v>

6
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.570
<v Speaker 1>There's been tremendous stress placed on</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual liberation and so there's this </v>

7
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.521
<v Speaker 1>idea that I think is associated in large</v>
<v Speaker 1>part right now with the radical left of </v>

8
00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:35.831
<v Speaker 1>total sexual freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time there's increasing </v>

9
00:00:36.231 --> 00:00:41.231
<v Speaker 1>emphasis from exactly the same sources </v>
<v Speaker 1>on restricting sexual interaction.</v>

10
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:44.900
<v Speaker 1>So you see this in the campuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

11
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:49.901
<v Speaker 1>where increasingly particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>heterosexual contact is regulated by a </v>

12
00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:55.091
<v Speaker 1>doctrine that says you have to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoken permission for every move in the </v>

13
00:00:55.091 --> 00:00:58.790
<v Speaker 1>mating process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you see,</v>

14
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.450
<v Speaker 1>and I know I'm not expressing myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>very well,</v>

15
00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:04.310
<v Speaker 1>but there seems to be in our current </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

16
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:06.650
<v Speaker 1>there seems to be massive sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>confusion.</v>

17
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's some weird combination of extreme </v>

18
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.831
<v Speaker 1>libertinism and extreme authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitudes towards sexuality and and </v>

19
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.740
<v Speaker 1>obviously in the story of Sodom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of what's happening happening and </v>

20
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.630
<v Speaker 1>is that sex impulsive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sexual gratification trumps everything.</v>

21
00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:32.321
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know there's more to what's </v>

22
00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:32.930
<v Speaker 1>going on in Sodom than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's certainly that and so.</v>

23
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure out what to say </v>

24
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 1>about that tonight because there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lesson in there.</v>

25
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>The lesson is something like,</v>

26
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.930
<v Speaker 1>don't let sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't let impulsive sexuality get the </v>

27
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.441
<v Speaker 1>upper hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that or all hell </v>

28
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:54.691
<v Speaker 1>will break loose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I actually happen to agree with </v>

29
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't been able to talk about in our </v>

30
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.811
<v Speaker 1>culture I think is let's take the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the phenomena of aids aids mutated to</v>

31
00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:06.970
<v Speaker 1>take advantage of promiscuous sexuality </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's just nothing.</v>

32
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.060
<v Speaker 1>You never hear that publicized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

33
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.660
<v Speaker 1>people had associated aids with </v>
<v Speaker 1>homosexuality and there was a reason for</v>

34
00:02:13.661 --> 00:02:18.661
<v Speaker 1>that because it's much more easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmitted as a consequence of </v>

35
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:21.301
<v Speaker 1>homosexual sex than heterosexual sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the anus is a much more delicate</v>

36
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>physiological structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as robust and it can be much </v>

37
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.721
<v Speaker 1>more easily damaged and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with with disease resulting as a </v>

38
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:35.311
<v Speaker 1>consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't only the manner of sexual </v>

39
00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:35.311
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the issue,</v>

40
00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:40.201
<v Speaker 1>it's also the fact that promiscuity </v>
<v Speaker 1>provided the evolutionary platform for </v>

41
00:02:40.421 --> 00:02:45.421
<v Speaker 1>the aids virus to mutate into a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the form that it finally took and </v>

42
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:49.681
<v Speaker 1>it was only through by the skin of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>teeth that we escaped a totalizing </v>

43
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>plague.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

44
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 1>had that emerged 100 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God only knows how many people would </v>

45
00:02:57.001 --> 00:02:58.000
<v Speaker 1>have died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

46
00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:03.001
<v Speaker 1>AIDS was unbelievably so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that's a mishmash of ideas and </v>

47
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exactly sure how to see my way </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear through it,</v>

48
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>but there is a clear warning in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>story about,</v>

49
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.650
<v Speaker 1>about something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about something to do with,</v>

50
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with sexual inequity,</v>

51
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 2>but in the Bible that sexuality has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>two Poles that define it and it's pretty</v>

52
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 2>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

53
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.100
<v Speaker 2>what inside is reproduction and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other side is we could,</v>

54
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 2>let's say Rick Creation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

55
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 2>so those are the two poles of sexuality </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a normal word.</v>

56
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just for reproduction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just for recreation.</v>

57
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.880
<v Speaker 2>It's both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

58
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 2>That was the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

59
00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 2>it's a natural idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

60
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.040
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's a balance there that should </v>

61
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 2>be had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you lose this balance and they become</v>

62
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.430
<v Speaker 2>just about reproduction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem and they fed.</v>

63
00:03:58.431 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 2>It becomes just about recreation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another problem.</v>

64
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.480
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

65
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.800
<v Speaker 2>It's not that complicated really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so politically incorrect to </v>

66
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 2>talk about these things even though </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're obvious.</v>

67
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.840
<v Speaker 2>Well that nobody dares you talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

68
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 1>The thing is is that the most difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to talk about are the things that</v>

69
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:19.240
<v Speaker 1>are obvious because when they're obvious</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to talk about them and so</v>

70
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 1>then when people start to question the </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious,</v>

71
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.660
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

72
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would.</v>

73
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about the slut walks and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>women go out and they dress very </v>

74
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:36.811
<v Speaker 1>provocatively and they go out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest their right to be as </v>

75
00:04:36.811 --> 00:04:39.700
<v Speaker 1>provocative as they possibly can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>without being interfered with.</v>

76
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.420
<v Speaker 1>And I have some sympathy for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective because it seems to me </v>

77
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>appropriate for women to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The final arbiter is in sexual contact,</v>

78
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.500
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also,</v>

79
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.330
<v Speaker 1>it's that whole exercise is blind to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that clothing,</v>

80
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has communicative intent</v>

81
00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.160
<v Speaker 3>and that</v>

82
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.240
<v Speaker 1>people broadcast their invitation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual congress in a million ways,</v>

83
00:05:05.241 --> 00:05:08.750
<v Speaker 1>subtle and not so subtle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't just say,</v>

84
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I have the right to broadcast myself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>any manner possible and be completely,</v>

85
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

86
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.840
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

87
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.810
<v Speaker 1>can be completely immune from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

88
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.870
<v Speaker 1>There's something wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with regards to basic sexual </v>

89
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.870
<v Speaker 1>morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

90
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I've read things about like slut shaming</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the more radical feminist types,</v>

91
00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:36.851
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>claim that women shouldn't be held </v>

92
00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:37.190
<v Speaker 1>responsible for their sexual behavior in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>

93
00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:39.560
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be held against them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many men they've slept with,</v>

94
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.240
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I think,</v>

95
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd never recommend to someone that </v>

96
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.691
<v Speaker 1>they laid down naked on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the side of the street with their </v>

97
00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:52.691
<v Speaker 1>legs spread and invite anybody who walks</v>
<v Speaker 1>by to partake of the opportunity.</v>

98
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.330
<v Speaker 1>Everyone would regard that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate,</v>

99
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.020
<v Speaker 1>I think without question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what that indicates is that some </v>

100
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 1>degree of sexual propriety is both </v>
<v Speaker 1>normative,</v>

101
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.310
<v Speaker 1>unethical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course you can start asking </v>

102
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.301
<v Speaker 1>yourself about what that degree of </v>
<v Speaker 1>social sexual propriety should be.</v>

103
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 1>And it does have something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting the balance between reproduction</v>

104
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:18.350
<v Speaker 1>and recreation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

105
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is,</v>

106
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.740
<v Speaker 2>even in the Bible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the two aspects.</v>

107
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 2>Some stories are about just this aspect </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

108
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 2>There are the most strange stories in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bible.</v>

109
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.320
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the story of Tamar is one of those.</v>

110
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.710
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

111
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you're familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that story,</v>

112
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.450
<v Speaker 2>but it's tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in the,</v>

113
00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:49.451
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's intercut with the story of Joseph </v>

114
00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:53.620
<v Speaker 2>in Egypt and it's essentially a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says that Judah had children with </v>

115
00:06:56.571 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 2>some woman and I think it's a stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't necessarily say so,</v>

116
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like that's what it is.</v>

117
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.810
<v Speaker 2>And then the sons die off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's this woman called Tamar</v>

118
00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 2>and she disguises herself as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>prostitute.</v>

119
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.660
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she has a kid with Judah himself.</v>

120
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.600
<v Speaker 2>So all of the symbols heard that story.</v>

121
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Elements of his clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:07:23.261 --> 00:07:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Damage</v>

123
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.240
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a bride.</v>

124
00:07:25.241 --> 00:07:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially</v>

125
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.730
<v Speaker 1>he wants to indicate later that he's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>one who slept with.</v>

126
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

127
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that story is about the necessity,</v>

128
00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 2>the need for the recreative part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexuality.</v>

129
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 2>It's all about that symbolism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about the seat.</v>

130
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:47.260
<v Speaker 2>It's all about incest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all about death and it's the idea </v>

131
00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:50.960
<v Speaker 2>is it's to raise the dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

132
00:07:50.961 --> 00:07:53.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not clear in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you understand,</v>

133
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.860
<v Speaker 2>if you understand the imagery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what it's about.</v>

134
00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.160
<v Speaker 2>It's about regressing back to an error </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was made.</v>

135
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And raising the dead.</v>

136
00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.440
<v Speaker 2>So I don't want to get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's just the idea that in the Bible</v>

137
00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:11.441
<v Speaker 2>there's both to the hearse reproduction </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's recreation and the </v>

138
00:08:11.781 --> 00:08:16.100
<v Speaker 2>recreation is renewal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the renewal.</v>

139
00:08:16.101 --> 00:08:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Sexuality is about renewal too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that aspect of the symbolism is,</v>

140
00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:24.020
<v Speaker 2>is pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say obscure because it's</v>

141
00:08:24.021 --> 00:08:28.130
<v Speaker 2>actually right there if you can see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's strange.</v>

142
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:28.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll say it like that.</v>

143
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.710
<v Speaker 1>Strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

144
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.750
<v Speaker 1>So now another element of this might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that in modern identity </v>

145
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:40.371
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual choice is a canonical identifier </v>

146
00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:42.810
<v Speaker 1>and that also seems to me to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>something wrong about that.</v>

147
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in Toronto,</v>

148
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's the same in Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

149
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.890
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to do this awkwardly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put this awkwardly because </v>

150
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been able to sort through it </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

151
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pride week,</v>

152
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Pride Day has turned into pride week and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's turned into pride month and I </v>

153
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:08.511
<v Speaker 1>think that seems to me to be pushing </v>
<v Speaker 1>against some kind of limit because the </v>

154
00:09:08.511 --> 00:09:13.011
<v Speaker 1>first question that I have is like I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading this book the other day by a </v>

155
00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:17.571
<v Speaker 1>friend of mine from Ottawa who's a gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative and he said he had a lot </v>

156
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:22.671
<v Speaker 1>harder time coming out as a conservative</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he had as coming out as gay and he </v>

157
00:09:24.301 --> 00:09:29.301
<v Speaker 1>talked about the degree to which </v>
<v Speaker 1>homosexuals were persecuted in Canada </v>

158
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.860
<v Speaker 1>before say the 19 eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's quite,</v>

159
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.300
<v Speaker 1>it makes quite a harsh reading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

160
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:41.950
<v Speaker 1>And so and so fair enough to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the civil rights movement,</v>

161
00:09:46.491 --> 00:09:47.360
<v Speaker 1>let's say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

162
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:51.800
<v Speaker 1>that has brought homosexuality into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>norm or that into the mainstream.</v>

163
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's one way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

164
00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:57.620
<v Speaker 1>but that conversation still has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of development.</v>

165
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:02.270
<v Speaker 1>That's necessary because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand exactly,</v>

166
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.040
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious to me what integration </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the mainstream precisely means </v>

167
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.090
<v Speaker 1>because a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been a lot of talk so far about</v>

168
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.680
<v Speaker 1>respecting the rights of gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very little talk about what the </v>

169
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.030
<v Speaker 1>accompanying responsibilities might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Actually,</v>

170
00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:25.170
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me to be a problem and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean I just had a letter from,</v>

171
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.620
<v Speaker 1>from Guy Gay guy who has been wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this because he's not sure how to </v>

172
00:10:31.501 --> 00:10:34.260
<v Speaker 1>be gay and to be ethical at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

173
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:39.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he sees part of normative </v>

174
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.541
<v Speaker 1>behavior is taking wife and having </v>
<v Speaker 1>children and not and can see the value </v>

175
00:10:41.541 --> 00:10:45.201
<v Speaker 1>in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's certainly not the direction </v>

176
00:10:45.201 --> 00:10:45.201
<v Speaker 1>of his proclivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we wrote,</v>

177
00:10:45.201 --> 00:10:49.110
<v Speaker 1>wrote to me asking me what he should do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

178
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't have an answer for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the answer to that is,</v>

179
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.580
<v Speaker 1>but I know that it might be something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be worth talking about and </v>

180
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.190
<v Speaker 1>it's part of this current confusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>about sexual identity and sexual </v>

181
00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:07.010
<v Speaker 1>pleasure and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and well even gender identity for that </v>

182
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.010
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

183
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your idea was,</v>

184
00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:15.000
<v Speaker 1>well the balance between recreation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduction had gone,</v>

185
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:19.370
<v Speaker 1>was completely absent inside of it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>all recreation.</v>

186
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.620
<v Speaker 1>It was all instant gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Impulse.</v>

187
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why it's put in contrast with</v>

188
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.750
<v Speaker 2>the Abraham bit because it's the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>angels,</v>

189
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.360
<v Speaker 2>but in that case he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says you'll have a son this time next</v>

190
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.330
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's the reproduction part is there,</v>

191
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.940
<v Speaker 2>but when he gets to the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not there anymore.</v>

192
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.400
<v Speaker 2>It's only the recreation part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

193
00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.180
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're,</v>

194
00:11:45.181 --> 00:11:46.880
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're meant to be contested.</v>

195
00:11:46.881 --> 00:11:51.230
<v Speaker 2>Those two stores actually in the story </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Abraham,</v>

196
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty clear he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this will make sense </v>

197
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.830
<v Speaker 2>because when the angels come it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says,</v>

198
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:04.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he washes their feet and then he feeds </v>

199
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:05.510
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

200
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.680
<v Speaker 2>That's actually the recreation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reproduction part that not in terms of </v>

201
00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:16.141
<v Speaker 2>sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's in terms of meaning the </v>

202
00:12:16.141 --> 00:12:20.550
<v Speaker 2>renewal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the washing of the feet is the </v>

203
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.550
<v Speaker 2>recreation part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their renewal,</v>

204
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:24.610
<v Speaker 2>they're restarting and the feeding is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the reproduction part.</v>

205
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in a sexual way,</v>

206
00:12:25.721 --> 00:12:28.390
<v Speaker 2>but when you feed something food and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>eats it,</v>

207
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:30.550
<v Speaker 2>it integrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it integrates it correctly.</v>

208
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.310
<v Speaker 2>That's like our reproduction of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity,</v>

209
00:12:33.311 --> 00:12:36.580
<v Speaker 2>your you're staying yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're reproducing yourself,</v>

210
00:12:36.581 --> 00:12:38.260
<v Speaker 2>so when you eat food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're doing.</v>

211
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Not like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in a sexual way,</v>

212
00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:45.091
<v Speaker 2>but it has the exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning if you eat something that you </v>

213
00:12:45.091 --> 00:12:47.590
<v Speaker 2>can integrate correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're reproducing your pattern.</v>

214
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like the correct version of </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

215
00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.290
<v Speaker 2>The other side,</v>

216
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.740
<v Speaker 1>the washing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is little flood</v>

217
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.710
<v Speaker 2>the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many flood,</v>

218
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also is an acceptable.</v>

219
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.930
<v Speaker 1>It's a controlled one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're washing the dust off the roads,</v>

220
00:13:03.931 --> 00:13:05.890
<v Speaker 1>dust off your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that you're.</v>

221
00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:11.200
<v Speaker 1>You're passing from one mode of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>into another because you're.</v>

222
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.830
<v Speaker 1>You're cleaning off the debris of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

223
00:13:13.831 --> 00:13:17.010
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and it's about </v>
<v Speaker 1>renewal next.</v>

224
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to see that when,</v>

225
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.310
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when matthew was talking about,</v>

226
00:13:20.311 --> 00:13:21.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have recreation,</v>

227
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.170
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand that recreation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and rest are basically the same thing.</v>

228
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Then you basically have the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>

229
00:13:26.941 --> 00:13:31.941
<v Speaker 1>It's sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Resting recreation are all things that </v>

230
00:13:31.941 --> 00:13:33.600
<v Speaker 1>bring you into renewal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

231
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:34.320
