1
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>So this is more differentiation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype fundamentally.</v>

2
00:00:05.101 --> 00:00:10.101
<v Speaker 1>So you see the dragon of chaos here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that potential manifesting itself into </v>

3
00:00:10.101 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>this ambivalent feminine figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both both promise and threat.</v>

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.510
<v Speaker 1>And then I've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've mapped this one out.</v>

5
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:20.511
<v Speaker 1>So the ambivalent feminine figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so sort of multi valence gives rise to </v>

6
00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:24.351
<v Speaker 1>the positive mother and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive mother gives birth to the hero </v>

7
00:00:24.351 --> 00:00:25.950
<v Speaker 1>and that's Hercules there and this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like this image a lot.</v>

8
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>So Hercules is in this container so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can interpret that.</v>

9
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:35.211
<v Speaker 1>Both has something feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that container but also as a </v>

10
00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:37.611
<v Speaker 1>representative of culture because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>boat that is floating on the chaotic </v>

11
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:37.611
<v Speaker 1>ocean here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that target,</v>

12
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>he asked to be in a container that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustains him in the murky water of chaos</v>

13
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>and you see he's going out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown and he's got a lion's skin on.</v>

14
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>initiation rituals for,</v>

15
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.380
<v Speaker 1>for young men when the reliance say in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East and that wasn't very </v>

16
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.681
<v Speaker 1>long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that you had to go and kill a lion </v>

17
00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:00.681
<v Speaker 1>with a spear and with a bow and Arrow or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

18
00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:04.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All things considered.</v>

19
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean you really think about that for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

20
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>You really want to go out and try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill a lion with a stick.</v>

21
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like it probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably wouldn't be quite the same </v>

22
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.650
<v Speaker 1>after you did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be my guess.</v>

23
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.110
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's.</v>

24
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:21.111
<v Speaker 1>Hercules has got his lion skin on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shows that he's assimilated to the </v>

25
00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:24.651
<v Speaker 1>lion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominant sort of animal and that </v>

26
00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 1>he's also mastered it and he's got his </v>
<v Speaker 1>bow and Arrow to so he's.</v>

27
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 1>He's going to hit the target properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not.</v>

28
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.330
<v Speaker 1>He's someone who doesn't seem because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>can hit the center of the target and </v>

29
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.640
<v Speaker 1>he's got this club which I really liked </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's covered with eyes just like</v>

30
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Martech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mesopotamian hero.</v>

31
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:41.451
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to do when you go out </v>

32
00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:41.451
<v Speaker 1>into the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like arm yourself and pay attention</v>

33
00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:43.350
<v Speaker 1>and so that's what you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce.</v>

34
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>If you're a good mother is this figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can go out into the unknown,</v>

35
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>armed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate,</v>

36
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.440
<v Speaker 1>and able to pay attention and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell of a thing to participate in and </v>

37
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.681
<v Speaker 1>it's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found having children incredibly </v>

38
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:02.150
<v Speaker 1>entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculously entertaining thing to </v>

39
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.671
<v Speaker 1>do because for a bunch of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that it's the only relationship </v>

40
00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:09.381
<v Speaker 1>you'll ever have in your life where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you actually have a chance of </v>

41
00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:12.411
<v Speaker 1>establishing something that's close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect is with your kids because when </v>

42
00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 1>they're delivered to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

43
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.980
<v Speaker 1>they're there in some sense they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect and your job is to maintain that</v>

44
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:19.290
<v Speaker 1>perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can,</v>

45
00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>and you do that by being a good parent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by being encouraging,</v>

46
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 1>by being on their side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by taking care of them,</v>

47
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>and you can have an absolutely pristine </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the child.</v>

48
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.990
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean it's not full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble because it is,</v>

49
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's it.</v>

50
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>It can easily be the best relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll ever have in your life.</v>

51
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's.</v>

52
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.170
<v Speaker 1>It can be the worst to and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you get unlucky in your child </v>

53
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.741
<v Speaker 1>is sick mentally or physically and </v>
<v Speaker 1>things fall apart and it's not your </v>

54
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:46.920
<v Speaker 1>fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it is your fault,</v>

55
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.950
<v Speaker 1>but it's a real gift and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play this game of protection and </v>

56
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>encouragement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

57
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Protection and encouragement and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>that dynamic right,</v>

58
00:02:56.941 --> 00:03:01.941
<v Speaker 1>and then you build,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you help someone develop into something </v>

59
00:03:01.941 --> 00:03:05.151
<v Speaker 1>that's well exactly this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can take on the troubles of the </v>

60
00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:06.660
<v Speaker 1>world forthrightly and man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you want.</v>

61
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.870
<v Speaker 1>That'll make it worthwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
