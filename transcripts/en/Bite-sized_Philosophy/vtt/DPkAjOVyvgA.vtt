00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.400
<v Speaker 1>This is an image of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I would call it the patriarchy and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lovely image.</v>

3
00:00:06.611 --> 00:00:09.820
<v Speaker 1>It's God the father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's assimilated to the sun because,</v>

4
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because consciousness which is </v>

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.121
<v Speaker 1>associated with light is the builder of </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and he rules over the walled </v>

6
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:22.921
<v Speaker 1>city and so he's the centering idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say that that unites a </v>

7
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:23.890
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of looking at it.</v>

8
00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:28.891
<v Speaker 1>And he's got two hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I described the miss security and </v>

9
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:31.360
<v Speaker 1>tyranny altogether order and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a university,</v>

10
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.550
<v Speaker 1>the u of t students complain about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

11
00:00:33.551 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>There's 60,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>university students,</v>

12
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel like numbers,</v>

13
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.930
<v Speaker 1>they feel ignored and no wonder because </v>
<v Speaker 1>their numbers and they are ignored.</v>

14
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:42.640
<v Speaker 1>It's no wonder they didn't feel that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

15
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's huge classes of 1200 people </v>

16
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.410
<v Speaker 1>and they get lost and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

17
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.630
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty evil structure.</v>

18
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.830
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uncaring.</v>

19
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

20
00:00:51.671 --> 00:00:53.980
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the same token,</v>

21
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to purchase four years of </v>

22
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.111
<v Speaker 1>intellectual freedom and you have all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people who could at least in </v>

23
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:04.351
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach you something and you get an </v>

24
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:06.391
<v Speaker 1>identity out of the deal and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>half a half a bit of sense here in the </v>

25
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:10.351
<v Speaker 1>library trying to read great things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're not quite as dopey and </v>

26
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:13.561
<v Speaker 1>useless when you come out as you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you went in and so it takes with </v>

27
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:17.371
<v Speaker 1>one hand and gives with the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've got to understand that about </v>

28
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:18.100
<v Speaker 1>your position in relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

29
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.740
<v Speaker 1>It crushes you and molds you at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

30
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.880
<v Speaker 1>It limits you and furthers your compute </v>
<v Speaker 1>capability at the same time,</v>

31
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>and it's up to you to determine how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>establish a harmonious and productive </v>

32
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.470
<v Speaker 1>relationship with that because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the fundamental demands of life.</v>

33
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Now it sort of splits into these two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

34
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>That's the king who devours his son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that picture and that's,</v>

35
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a society that's become </v>

36
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.330
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

37
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm the son of the king is the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that regenerates the king,</v>

38
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 1>the kings old and he's blind and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid and he's corrupt and he has a son</v>

39
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:57.810
<v Speaker 1>and the son is lively and awake and </v>
<v Speaker 1>alert and can see,</v>

40
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 1>and if the father's not pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he tries to make the sun strong so </v>

41
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.240
<v Speaker 1>that the son can grow up and revitalize </v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture and if he's a tyrant,</v>

42
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 1>well then he devours him and then he </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets old and corrupt and everything goes</v>

43
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.050
<v Speaker 1>into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the benevolent king </v>

44
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.040
<v Speaker 1>who's got that properly balanced and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see in this picture he's got a globe but</v>

45
00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:24.041
<v Speaker 1>his hand with the cross on top of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's means the same thing that </v>

46
00:02:24.041 --> 00:02:27.780
<v Speaker 1>that other symbolic image did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that the proper society </v>

47
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.821
<v Speaker 1>supports the suffering individual in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>or her attempts to transcend their </v>

48
00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>suffering and attain a proper ethical </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

49
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.350
<v Speaker 1>And then the son of the father is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hero.</v>

50
00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:41.240
<v Speaker 1>That's Hercules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked that picture.</v>

51
00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:46.241
<v Speaker 1>So Hercules goes out into the darkness </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's got this container and maybe </v>

52
00:02:46.241 --> 00:02:47.600
<v Speaker 1>you can think of that container as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural artifact.</v>

53
00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:52.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the culture protects you from </v>

54
00:02:52.601 --> 00:02:53.420
<v Speaker 1>chaos and then the question is what are </v>
<v Speaker 1>you supposed to do with that protection?</v>

55
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.080
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is you're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wear the garb of the lion,</v>

56
00:02:57.081 --> 00:02:58.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the king of the beasts.</v>

57
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:03.761
<v Speaker 1>So that's supposed to be you and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to go out there into the </v>

58
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:06.871
<v Speaker 1>darkest with your bloody eyes open so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can discover what's in the darkness </v>

59
00:03:06.871 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>and share with everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's got a club.</v>

60
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>They're in his hands and the club was </v>
<v Speaker 1>covered with eyes.</v>

61
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:15.181
<v Speaker 1>Those are eyes not barbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that you should </v>

62
00:03:15.181 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>bloody well pay attention and that well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other element of that,</v>

63
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>it's not expressed in that image that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should also speak carefully,</v>

64
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and speak carefully,</v>

65
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.570
<v Speaker 1>and then you're the proper son of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proper father and you can keep things </v>

66
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 1>functioning and that makes you into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

67
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the city is always threatened.</v>

68
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:37.171
<v Speaker 1>It's always corrupt and threatened and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always something outside that's </v>

69
00:03:37.171 --> 00:03:40.351
<v Speaker 1>going to take it down always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's represented by the </v>

70
00:03:40.351 --> 00:03:44.041
<v Speaker 1>Dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That little twist and its tail is </v>

71
00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:46.171
<v Speaker 1>something that represents infinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the courageous individual goes out </v>

72
00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:49.831
<v Speaker 1>of the damage city to confront the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon of chaos into gained something </v>

73
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:54.420
<v Speaker 1>valuable as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what human beings are </v>

74
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's our destiny.</v>

75
00:03:56.351 --> 00:04:01.351
<v Speaker 1>That's our soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a better way of thinking about </v>

76
00:04:01.351 --> 00:04:01.570
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of that terrible dragon is just</v>

77
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:06.571
<v Speaker 1>the catastrophe and suffering of life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and our continual attempts to </v>

78
00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:09.991
<v Speaker 1>transcendent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a tremendous amount of it is also </v>

79
00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:12.541
<v Speaker 1>the malevolence and the evil that exists</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our own hearts and in society and </v>

80
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.280
<v Speaker 1>perhaps to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in the world itself.</v>

81
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.490
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to wake up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>strengthen yourself and stand up </v>

82
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.091
<v Speaker 1>properly and fortify yourself so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a light that can shine in the </v>

83
00:04:24.091 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 1>darkness and that's something that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>withstand malevolence and tragedy.</v>

84
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.970
<v Speaker 1>And what's your alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to let life crush you and </v>

85
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.440
<v Speaker 1>make you weak and make you resentful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitter and then murderous.</v>

86
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.740
<v Speaker 1>You'll take out your rage on everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can and it'll only be limited by </v>

87
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 1>your capacity to obtain power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a good thing.</v>

88
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.300
<v Speaker 1>And so it's this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's this way or a way that leads </v>

89
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.810
<v Speaker 1>directly to hell and we've certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen that plenty of times in the last </v>

90
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 1>hundred years and you'd think we might </v>
<v Speaker 1>have learned our lesson,</v>

91
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>but it takes a lot for people to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're in danger of repeating exactly</v>

92
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 1>the same mistakes again.</v>

93
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.660
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing to complain about the </v>

94
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.140
<v Speaker 1>political polarization and it's another </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to point fingers out.</v>

95
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:12.870
<v Speaker 1>The postmodernist send the Neo Marxists </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they,</v>

96
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.920
<v Speaker 1>they roundly deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my estimation.</v>

97
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.460
<v Speaker 1>It's another thing to try to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the proper alternative is.</v>

98
00:05:20.461 --> 00:05:23.280
<v Speaker 1>And a proper alternative is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my estimation,</v>

99
00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:27.240
<v Speaker 1>to contribute to political polarization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

100
00:05:27.241 --> 00:05:30.600
<v Speaker 1>And it's not that the radical right is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the solution to the radical left.</v>

101
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.690
<v Speaker 1>It's just another catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only solution that I've been </v>

102
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.231
<v Speaker 1>able to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is as a consequence of much </v>

103
00:05:39.231 --> 00:05:41.811
<v Speaker 1>reading and much thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's up to the individuals in </v>

104
00:05:41.811 --> 00:05:45.291
<v Speaker 1>our society is sort themselves out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to strengthen themselves and to become </v>

105
00:05:45.291 --> 00:05:48.600
<v Speaker 1>wise and alert and to shoulder the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of being.</v>

106
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.780
<v Speaker 1>And the demand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ethical demand to pushback </v>

107
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790
<v Speaker 1>malevolence in their own hearts and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their society.</v>

108
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.190
<v Speaker 1>And I also believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

109
00:05:56.191 --> 00:06:01.191
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult for people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect themselves because they're weak </v>

110
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>and vulnerable and pathetic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolent.</v>

111
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 1>And so it's no and they're not what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be and they know it.</v>

112
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 1>And so it's no wonder that people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect themselves.</v>

113
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.940
<v Speaker 1>And some of that's nature and some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's culture and some of it's </v>

114
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.551
<v Speaker 1>individual weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that I've learned </v>

115
00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:17.120
<v Speaker 1>and it's about the only optimistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought I've ever come across is that if</v>

116
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:22.121
<v Speaker 1>you have enough courage to forthrightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>accept the fact that you're vulnerable </v>

117
00:06:22.121 --> 00:06:24.380
<v Speaker 1>and malevolent and you're willing to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about it,</v>

118
00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:29.381
<v Speaker 1>to overcome it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can develop enough respect for </v>

119
00:06:29.381 --> 00:06:31.811
<v Speaker 1>yourself so that the terrible way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being will not make you malevolent and </v>

120
00:06:31.811 --> 00:06:33.830
<v Speaker 1>corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that you have anything</v>

121
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 1>better to aim for unless you want blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the streets in a pathetic life.</v>

122
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 1>And so you might as well straighten up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get your act together.</v>

123
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:44.330
<v Speaker 1>And maybe we've got some chance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting through this intermediary period</v>

124
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:49.331
<v Speaker 1>of chaos that we all face and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>something better out of it instead of </v>

125
00:06:49.331 --> 00:06:51.950
<v Speaker 1>something worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I have to say about that.</v>

126
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.520
<v Speaker 1>So thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
