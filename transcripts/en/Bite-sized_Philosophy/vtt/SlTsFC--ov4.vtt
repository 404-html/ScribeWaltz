1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Can you hazard a guess what Europe is </v>
<v Speaker 1>clamping down on speech critical of </v>

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Islam when Islam is causing lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems with rape,</v>

3
00:00:07.421 --> 00:00:08.380
<v Speaker 1>gangs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism,</v>

4
00:00:08.381 --> 00:00:10.510
<v Speaker 1>and generally being a menace?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the first,</v>

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>let's say if I was going to oppose that </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>

7
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.060
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it's a propaganda stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.620
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy to blame what's happening in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe on Islamic immigrants?</v>

11
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 1>I guess part of the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that at least as far as I can tell,</v>

12
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:43.161
<v Speaker 1>the news has become sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 1>unreliable because it's so polarized </v>

13
00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>that we can't really tell what's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

14
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason that Europe is </v>

15
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>clamping down on speech critical of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam is partly the same reason that the</v>

16
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:58.101
<v Speaker 1>entire Western world is clamping down on</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech that's critical of anything that </v>

17
00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:02.540
<v Speaker 1>is associated with group identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty much any set of ideas </v>

18
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.321
<v Speaker 1>that unites people and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a consequence of the collective </v>

19
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:11.841
<v Speaker 1>decision that we've made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That egalitarianism and a conflict </v>

20
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:17.451
<v Speaker 1>avoidance constitute the two highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtues and they trump everything else </v>

21
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:17.520
<v Speaker 1>including free speech.</v>

22
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Now why that's happened is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing to say.</v>

23
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:27.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect to some degree that it's a </v>

24
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>consequence of women becoming involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the political system,</v>

25
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.820
<v Speaker 1>which is something that we've never </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced before and women are more </v>

26
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>agreeable by nature than men and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>variable.</v>

27
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>People are are compassionate towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

28
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 1>They see a suffering and that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>include any minority,</v>

29
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:49.140
<v Speaker 1>especially when you combine that with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of neo Marxist doctrine that claims</v>

30
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>that anyone who has an advantage swiped </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

31
00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:56.901
<v Speaker 1>And I think in the Islamic situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get it real conflict there because </v>

32
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.300
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously the case that many </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic practices are not commensurate </v>

33
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.160
<v Speaker 1>with postmodern neo Marxist feminism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

34
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:09.090
<v Speaker 1>But they seem to get a free pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that's because the idea that</v>

35
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:14.120
<v Speaker 1>all cultures are equal trumps the </v>
<v Speaker 1>requirement for human rights for women.</v>

36
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe the other thing that's even </v>

37
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.691
<v Speaker 1>darker is that there's a fair bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary fervor in the more radical</v>

38
00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:29.421
<v Speaker 1>end of the political spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that radical fervor is devoted </v>

39
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:33.981
<v Speaker 1>towards tearing down the patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's basically Western </v>

40
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if,</v>

41
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.640
<v Speaker 1>because Islam isn't part of Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>

42
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>than it can be seen as an ally in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that attempt,</v>

43
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.320
<v Speaker 1>that's what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think that ignorance and and all </v>

44
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:53.721
<v Speaker 1>of that contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't obvious that people who are </v>

45
00:02:54.451 --> 00:02:59.451
<v Speaker 1>afraid of such things as Islamophobia </v>
<v Speaker 1>really understand anything about Islam </v>

46
00:02:59.451 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't say I understand anything about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>

47
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Even though I've read a fair bit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

48
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to put yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside a different belief system.</v>

49
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm somewhat apprehensive about Islam </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it looks to me like it's a </v>

50
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:18.841
<v Speaker 1>totalizing system as well as a religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a totalizing system because </v>

51
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>everything has to come under his </v>
<v Speaker 1>purview,</v>

52
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>including law and and everything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes along with that.</v>

53
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 1>There's no separation between church and</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

54
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.390
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't see how that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>commensurate with the western mode of </v>

55
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.601
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think people want to have </v>

56
00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:36.601
<v Speaker 1>that conversation because they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

57
00:03:36.601 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone diverse as they are.</v>

58
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:44.911
<v Speaker 1>And important as that diversity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently such that everyone has to be </v>

59
00:03:44.911 --> 00:03:49.201
<v Speaker 1>represented equally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The diversity isn't really of anything </v>

60
00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:53.280
<v Speaker 1>about anything fundamental and we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>all get along without a problem and I'm </v>

61
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 1>afraid that that's extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>naive.</v>

62
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.900
<v Speaker 1>And then I suppose there's also an </v>
<v Speaker 1>element of something like Western guilt,</v>

63
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 1>I guess perhaps for what has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>described as our imperialist past,</v>

64
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

65
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.150
<v Speaker 1>there's been a very longterm assault</v>

66
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.560
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

67
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.570
<v Speaker 2>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moral</v>

68
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.590
<v Speaker 1>on the morality of the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're often viewed as the rapers and </v>

69
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.091
<v Speaker 1>pillagers of the world and that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes along with the environmentalist </v>

70
00:04:29.091 --> 00:04:32.361
<v Speaker 1>ethos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think we do have a fair bit of </v>

71
00:04:32.361 --> 00:04:33.810
<v Speaker 1>guilt about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's warranted or not.</v>

72
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean history is a bloody nightmare and</v>

73
00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:40.470
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter where you look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say at least in the West has</v>

74
00:04:40.471 --> 00:04:43.620
<v Speaker 1>brought advantages along with its </v>
<v Speaker 1>disadvantages.</v>

75
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.520
<v Speaker 1>And I think that our attitude towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuality is fundamentally correct </v>

76
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>and absolutely vital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say that the only </v>

77
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.470
<v Speaker 1>countries in the world that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially worth living in,</v>

78
00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.680
<v Speaker 1>in any real sense are the ones that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the Judeo Christian </v>

79
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.200
<v Speaker 1>tradition and manifested in western the </v>
<v Speaker 1>western body of laws.</v>

80
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.740
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still plenty of guilt and </v>

81
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.790
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

82
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.220
<v Speaker 1>who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what contemptuous of being,</v>

83
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.510
<v Speaker 1>as we discussed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last question and also angry with </v>

84
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.751
<v Speaker 1>the political system because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerless or maybe they've been hurt by </v>

85
00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:23.790
<v Speaker 1>male authority figures.</v>

86
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that happens very frequently.</v>

87
00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:31.071
<v Speaker 1>And so they have absolutely no trust in </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher in hierarchical structures.</v>

88
00:05:31.711 --> 00:05:36.711
<v Speaker 1>And there you might add to that to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of laziness because the </v>

89
00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:40.350
<v Speaker 1>thing about hierarchical structures is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they impose values on people.</v>

90
00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:45.351
<v Speaker 1>And then in order to progress in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>value structure that you have to </v>

91
00:05:45.351 --> 00:05:48.081
<v Speaker 1>discipline yourself and work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And many of the radical leftists </v>

92
00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:49.590
<v Speaker 1>happened to be very low in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

93
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.740
<v Speaker 1>And so they don't believe in hard work </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't believe that people get </v>

94
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:55.960
<v Speaker 1>to where they're going by hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

95
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one other thing,</v>

96
00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:03.731
<v Speaker 1>there's a group of people I think who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were basically personality disordered </v>

97
00:06:03.731 --> 00:06:07.251
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the ones that had never had a </v>

98
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 1>positive relationship with anything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was masculine.</v>

99
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>And so whenever they see anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine that has motive power and that</v>

100
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 1>would include authority and competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just power,</v>

101
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.100
<v Speaker 1>they assume that that's tyrannical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the postmodern assumption </v>

102
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 1>that all power higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all hierarchies are hierarchies of power</v>

103
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:29.170
<v Speaker 1>when the truth of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that hierarchies in the West are </v>

104
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 1>usually hierarchies of authority and </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence and they're like,</v>

105
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:36.131
<v Speaker 1>they're oriented towards getting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain task done and they actually do </v>

106
00:06:36.131 --> 00:06:36.131
<v Speaker 1>get the task done.</v>

107
00:06:36.131 --> 00:06:38.240
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're,</v>

108
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm dubious about our own ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

109
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Integrity.</v>

110
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.210
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that's also why it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular importance for people to try </v>

111
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.991
<v Speaker 1>to act honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't act honestly and </v>

112
00:06:55.991 --> 00:06:59.740
<v Speaker 1>then you start to doubt your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrity and then when people come </v>

113
00:06:59.740 --> 00:06:59.740
<v Speaker 1>after you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be weak.</v>

114
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
