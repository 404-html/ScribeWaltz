1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.360
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had to tell someone that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are best suited to a subservient </v>

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.740
<v Speaker 1>slash blue collar lifestyle because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have any semblance of brilliance?</v>

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I want to take issue with the </v>

4
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.721
<v Speaker 1>formulation of that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I think it's a perfectly </v>

5
00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:14.721
<v Speaker 1>reasonable question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Jen Swan.</v>

6
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Don't be thinking that a blue collar </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle is necessarily subservient.</v>

7
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

8
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.860
<v Speaker 1>you can be a trades person and now it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a really good career choice as far as </v>

9
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

10
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.130
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very valuable in,</v>

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good plumbers are rare and good </v>

12
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.550
<v Speaker 1>carpenters are rare and good brick </v>
<v Speaker 1>layers are rare and they're so useful.</v>

13
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of renovation work.</v>

14
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>I've done an awful lot of renovation </v>
<v Speaker 1>work on all the places that I've,</v>

15
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.870
<v Speaker 1>I've lived in and I've learned to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fair bit of construction and automotive </v>

16
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.321
<v Speaker 1>body work and all those sorts of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really liked doing it and you </v>

17
00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:45.321
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

18
00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Speaker 1>they're blue collar life is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily subservient at all because </v>

19
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.721
<v Speaker 1>you can be master of your trades domain </v>
<v Speaker 1>and be unbelievably economically useful </v>

20
00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:56.130
<v Speaker 1>and productive and creative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent and autonomous.</v>

21
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.130
<v Speaker 1>And so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing necessarily subservient </v>

22
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.130
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>now if you're thinking more about about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say life at the low end of a </v>

24
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even there,</v>

25
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:11.811
<v Speaker 1>if you're a conscientious person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're careful and you and you're awake </v>

26
00:01:11.811 --> 00:01:15.030
<v Speaker 1>and you treat the people around you well</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do your job properly,</v>

27
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 1>there's also room for advancement in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>private sphere.</v>

28
00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:22.401
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason to assume whatsoever </v>
<v Speaker 1>that merely because you don't have the </v>

29
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>intellectual horsepower to work well in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Abd,</v>

30
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>in that in the domain of rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 1>shifting abstractions that your life has</v>

31
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>to be a secondary quality or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

32
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>or opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that at all.</v>

33
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.890
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there is endless opportunity in the </v>

34
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.890
<v Speaker 1>trades and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can,</v>

35
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.920
<v Speaker 1>in Toronto for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a chronic shortage of </v>

36
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.691
<v Speaker 1>tradespeople and there's always a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shortage of qualified people for every </v>

37
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.170
<v Speaker 1>occupation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

38
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:54.171
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I have to tell someone that they're </v>

39
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>best suited to a blue collar lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't feel bad about it.</v>

40
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I might say to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

41
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:56.830
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 1>let's assume you're talking to someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>who has an Iq of 100,</v>

44
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>which is the Iq of the average high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school graduate.</v>

45
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

46
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:05.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

47
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.690
<v Speaker 1>unless you're super conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

48
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.970
<v Speaker 1>a career in something like law is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not your best bet because </v>

49
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.031
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be competing with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have iqs that are like 30 points </v>

50
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 1>higher than yours or 25 points higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>than yours.</v>

51
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>And if you really work yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

52
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to main maintain </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitiveness in that domain,</v>

53
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to be working at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful disadvantage because the people</v>

54
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>that you're competing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

55
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>are going to be way faster than you </v>
<v Speaker 1>verbally.</v>

56
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be able to read faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into reason,</v>

57
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Speaker 1>verbally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster and and all of that,</v>

58
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>and it might be better to pick a a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

59
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>an ambition that's more in keeping with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality of your temperament and your</v>

60
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:44.760
<v Speaker 1>intelligence to to put it bluntly so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can be,</v>

61
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.040
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that your success </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be limited and it it.</v>

62
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.120
<v Speaker 1>It also doesn't mean that I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevating intelligence to to the </v>

63
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.260
<v Speaker 1>platform of the ultimate moral ideal </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the relationship between </v>

64
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and moral ideal is zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no relationship between them at</v>

65
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intelligence is a,</v>

66
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.320
<v Speaker 1>is a capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that can be put to ill use </v>

67
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>just as well as to good use and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing intrinsically better about smart</v>

68
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:15.541
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might be more useful for certain </v>

69
00:03:15.541 --> 00:03:15.541
<v Speaker 1>things if they're oriented towards the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

70
00:03:15.541 --> 00:03:20.310
<v Speaker 1>but there's absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no shortage of opportunity in </v>

71
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.171
<v Speaker 1>the working class end of the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and I can certainly understand </v>

72
00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:29.880
<v Speaker 1>often why people might prefer that to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To the endless miasma you might say </v>

73
00:03:33.111 --> 00:03:36.110
<v Speaker 1>chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miasma of complex abstract jobs.</v>

74
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.200
<v Speaker 1>One of the problems with those sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs is that you're never done.</v>

75
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>It never finished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always more work than you can </v>

76
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>possibly do.</v>
