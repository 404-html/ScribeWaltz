1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't want my young children </v>
<v Speaker 1>indoctrinated with dangerous ideas.</v>

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as time marches on,</v>

3
00:00:06.141 --> 00:00:11.141
<v Speaker 1>I trust public education less and less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that you have strong thoughts on </v>

4
00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:14.060
<v Speaker 1>the danger of the devouring oedipal </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother who harms her child by protecting</v>

5
00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:19.061
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's certainly not what I aspire </v>

6
00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:22.661
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if in spite of your idea that </v>

7
00:00:22.661 --> 00:00:24.170
<v Speaker 1>kids need to become tough and learn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>slay dragons,</v>

8
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.560
<v Speaker 1>if you have anything good to say about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of homeschooling.</v>

9
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have anything bad to say about </v>

10
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.891
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do know that the government has </v>

11
00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:39.010
<v Speaker 2>recently taken moves to make it much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more difficult for people to homeschool </v>

12
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.610
<v Speaker 2>their children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not like five years.</v>

13
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 years ago I would have presumed that </v>

14
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.321
<v Speaker 2>the vast majority of people who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>homeschooled schooling their children </v>

15
00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:52.670
<v Speaker 2>were to be viewed with skepticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Initially.</v>

16
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so sure about that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

17
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sent a poster today.</v>

18
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.780
<v Speaker 2>Someone sent me this link that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>found in the local junior high school </v>

19
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.860
<v Speaker 2>and one of the media pieces that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommended on this poster was a movie </v>

20
00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:18.431
<v Speaker 2>called Hedwig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the angry inch now I thought that </v>

21
00:01:18.431 --> 00:01:22.601
<v Speaker 2>was a terrible movie even though I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly capable of enjoying bizarre </v>

22
00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:22.880
<v Speaker 2>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

23
00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 2>So it's a bizarre movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>

24
00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:28.190
<v Speaker 2>But I also thought it was a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitter movie.</v>

25
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.560
<v Speaker 2>Terrible and bitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are separate.</v>

26
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.570
<v Speaker 2>A movie can be bitter and be quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

27
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.820
<v Speaker 2>but it was a terrible movie and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitter movie.</v>

28
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.130
<v Speaker 2>But I can tell you one bloody thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that movie.</v>

29
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not required viewing for 12 year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old kids,</v>

30
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 2>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think you have increasing reason to</v>

31
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:47.180
<v Speaker 2>be skeptical of the public education </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

32
00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:52.181
<v Speaker 2>I also looked at the Elementary Teachers</v>
<v Speaker 2>Federation of Ontario's guidelines for </v>

33
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:55.490
<v Speaker 2>education from kindergarten to grade </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>

34
00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.730
<v Speaker 2>And what that is in essence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think I will do a video about it </v>

35
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.890
<v Speaker 2>in the relatively near future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a blueprint for transforming children</v>

36
00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:08.891
<v Speaker 2>into social justice warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have basically says that it's like you </v>

37
00:02:08.891 --> 00:02:10.130
<v Speaker 2>don't have to be a conspiracy theory to </v>
<v Speaker 2>read that.</v>

38
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:15.131
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have social justice tribunals in </v>

39
00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Ontario and so the idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

40
00:02:15.261 --> 00:02:18.350
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to get your children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to get people to,</v>

41
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.760
<v Speaker 2>what would you say favor equity </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly?</v>

42
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.790
<v Speaker 2>Well then you better start teaching them</v>
<v Speaker 2>while they're young.</v>

43
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now you,</v>

44
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.060
<v Speaker 2>you asked that question properly because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's say,</v>

45
00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:37.550
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the terrible education system,</v>

46
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.950
<v Speaker 2>the wonderful mother homeschooling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

47
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:41.090
<v Speaker 2>That's the danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

48
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:46.091
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it might not be the wonderful </v>

49
00:02:46.091 --> 00:02:49.241
<v Speaker 2>mother homeschooling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be the pathological mother </v>

50
00:02:49.241 --> 00:02:52.031
<v Speaker 2>using the pathology of the education </v>
<v Speaker 2>system as an excuse to get her talons </v>

51
00:02:52.031 --> 00:02:53.120
<v Speaker 2>into her children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

52
00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:58.121
<v Speaker 2>Because that's certainly equally </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible or perhaps even more possible </v>

53
00:02:58.121 --> 00:02:58.820
<v Speaker 2>because at least in the public </v>
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>

54
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.200
<v Speaker 2>there's some necessity for consensus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's something that you have to be </v>

55
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 2>very aware of and work to prevent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

56
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say if you're going to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

57
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 2>probably best not to do it on your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you need.</v>

58
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 2>It's like you need a board of advisors </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that.</v>

59
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe it can't just be you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to figure out,</v>

60
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:25.621
<v Speaker 2>well what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the name and how are you going </v>

61
00:03:25.621 --> 00:03:28.971
<v Speaker 2>to manage that and what makes you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do it even if it's being done </v>

62
00:03:28.971 --> 00:03:28.971
<v Speaker 2>badly publicly.</v>

63
00:03:28.971 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 2>What makes you think you could do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>better?</v>

64
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my general advice is,</v>

65
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 2>and people have asked me this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

66
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:39.121
<v Speaker 2>I had a conversation with the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>was tiling my backyard this morning </v>

67
00:03:39.121 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 2>about something his son had said to him </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he was taught at school recently,</v>

68
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 2>which really made the tyler who had come</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a rather authoritarian country,</v>

69
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.980
<v Speaker 2>step back on his heels and think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so sure I should be sending my </v>

70
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 2>kid to public school anymore and maybe I</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't be living in Toronto even,</v>

71
00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.720
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my general advice is keep an eye on </v>

72
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 2>your kids and discuss with them what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're learning and,</v>

73
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 2>and help equip them with the tools to</v>

74
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.870
<v Speaker 2>not only to articulate their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewpoint in response to what they're </v>

75
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.821
<v Speaker 2>being taught now at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is you might not have the </v>

76
00:04:19.821 --> 00:04:19.821
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nor the ability to do that.</v>

77
00:04:19.821 --> 00:04:24.021
<v Speaker 2>That's no simple thing and increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're unwilling to have your </v>

78
00:04:24.241 --> 00:04:29.241
<v Speaker 2>children participate in what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasingly indoctrination and not </v>

79
00:04:29.241 --> 00:04:34.161
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks to in no small part to the </v>

80
00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Ontario Institute of Studies on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Education,</v>

81
00:04:34.531 --> 00:04:39.531
<v Speaker 2>which is an institution that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly despise because I think </v>

82
00:04:39.531 --> 00:04:44.091
<v Speaker 2>that all it does is almost all it does </v>
<v Speaker 2>now is produce indoctrinates of </v>

83
00:04:44.091 --> 00:04:46.500
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an easy,</v>

84
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.200
<v Speaker 2>it's not an easily easy problem to </v>
<v Speaker 2>solve,</v>

85
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.340
<v Speaker 2>so more more power to you wanting to put</v>
<v Speaker 2>your children in a situation where </v>

86
00:04:59.071 --> 00:05:03.300
<v Speaker 2>they're not being indoctrinated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the alternative is very,</v>

87
00:05:03.301 --> 00:05:06.540
<v Speaker 2>very complicated and difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

88
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thanks.</v>
