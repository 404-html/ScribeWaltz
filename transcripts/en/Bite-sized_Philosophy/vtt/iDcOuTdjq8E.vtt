1
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I've figured out </v>

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>over the last years is this is a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition,</v>

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.770
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty self evident that life is </v>

4
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.460
<v Speaker 1>has got its rat's nest of miseries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure,</v>

5
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:16.461
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you could even make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorical statement that life is </v>

6
00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:16.461
<v Speaker 1>mostly a rat's nest of misery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.510
<v Speaker 1>when you could make a pretty powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument for that,</v>

8
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>but then there's a counter question </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

9
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:26.361
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you tried not to make it any </v>

10
00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:26.361
<v Speaker 1>more miserable than it had to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

11
00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what would it be like?</v>

12
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>And my suspicions are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that lot of misery.</v>

13
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.230
<v Speaker 1>I would suspect that most of that misery</v>
<v Speaker 1>would go away because it's the </v>

14
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary misery that really brings </v>
<v Speaker 1>you down.</v>

15
00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

16
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone has cancer,</v>

17
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 1>it's like that sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like.</v>

18
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if only we had done this differently </v>

19
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.580
<v Speaker 1>than that wouldn't have happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when someone's out like torturing </v>

20
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.610
<v Speaker 1>you in a malevolent way or maybe you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the same,</v>

21
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:55.450
<v Speaker 1>you can always ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was really,</v>

22
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>is this really necessary?</v>

23
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Is this just like an useless add onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>the miseries of life?</v>

24
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Speaker 1>That's what disheartens people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so even in your own life,</v>

25
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

26
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.580
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you aren't suffering from self </v>

27
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.940
<v Speaker 1>imposed misery and you're only suffering</v>
<v Speaker 1>from an escapable misery,</v>

28
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could handle that and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you could,</v>

29
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>you could survive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could bear it,</v>

30
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>and even maybe without becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>irredeemably corrupt,</v>

31
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>so the goal would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

32
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:26.901
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is a rat's nest of miseries and </v>

33
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:29.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe it has no ultimate meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could say that if we're feeling </v>

34
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>particularly pessimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still leaves one question open,</v>

35
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:33.660
<v Speaker 1>which is if you didn't do everything you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could to make it worse,</v>

36
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.070
<v Speaker 1>how good could you make it be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the least answer is,</v>

37
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:39.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be tragedy,</v>

38
00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's right.</v>

39
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:46.590
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that that's the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>pessimistic proper statement.</v>

40
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.830
<v Speaker 1>The worst case outcome in the worst of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all possible worlds is that your life </v>

41
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>could be tragic but not hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot better than hell.</v>

42
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think I could give you an </v>

43
00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>example of the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're at your mother's death bed.</v>

44
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's tragedy.</v>

45
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Here's another scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're out of your mother's death bed </v>

46
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.861
<v Speaker 1>and all you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and all your idiot siblings are </v>

47
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:12.201
<v Speaker 1>arguing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the difference between </v>

48
00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:15.021
<v Speaker 1>tragedy and hell and you might be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to tolerate the first circumstance and </v>

49
00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would even bring you closer </v>
<v Speaker 1>together with your family members.</v>

50
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>The second one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one can bear that.</v>

51
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.420
<v Speaker 1>You walk away from a situation like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

52
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Sick of yourself and sick of everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else too and you know,</v>

53
00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:29.751
<v Speaker 1>it's often the case that tragic </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances bring out the dragons </v>

54
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:33.090
<v Speaker 1>because the stress is high and all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that people haven't dealt with,</v>

55
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.410
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the energy to repress </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

56
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:38.640
<v Speaker 1>and all the bitterness comes pouring </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

57
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>So like seriously man it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's actually a good.</v>

58
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a rough lesson but it's a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallmark for figuring out whether or not</v>

59
00:02:46.021 --> 00:02:51.021
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got yourself adjusted properly </v>

60
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:54.230
<v Speaker 1>and in relationship to your siblings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you were all gathered </v>

61
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>around the bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone close who was dying,</v>

62
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.920
<v Speaker 1>could you manage it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the answer is no,</v>

63
00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

64
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:04.741
<v Speaker 1>put your life together because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen and you should be the </v>

65
00:03:04.741 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>person who's there that can do it and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it properly,</v>

66
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.310
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe you'd find that it isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of thing that will undermine </v>

67
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>your faith in life itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen,</v>

68
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 1>I've seen both of those situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 1>ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugly,</v>

70
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 1>ugly situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderously,</v>

71
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:24.661
<v Speaker 1>ugly situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they're opposite where people </v>

72
00:03:24.661 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>have had terrible things happen and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to them as a family and you know,</v>

73
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 1>they pulled together and they rebuild </v>
<v Speaker 1>their damn ship and they sail away.</v>

74
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 1>And so that seems to me to be a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

75
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:36.790
<v Speaker 1>That makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:37.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the flood comes,</v>

77
00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

78
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the same thing.</v>

79
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 1>The question emerges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

80
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

81
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:47.731
<v Speaker 1>you could say you're this plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what people usually,</v>

82
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.030
<v Speaker 1>that's how people usually identified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they have no plan at all and </v>

83
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.030
<v Speaker 1>they're just in chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

84
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.510
<v Speaker 1>That's like being in the belly of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beast.</v>

85
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 1>They're nihilistic and chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no plan.</v>

86
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>They're just chaos itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very dreadful situation for</v>

87
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:05.791
<v Speaker 1>people to be in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe they conjured together a plan </v>

88
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 1>that's their identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of fragile and they're holding</v>

89
00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>onto that with with everything they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got.</v>

90
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:13.531
<v Speaker 1>It's their little stick award that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're floating in the ocean clinging </v>

91
00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:13.531
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

92
00:04:13.531 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 1>And so they're identifying really hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that plan.</v>

93
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens when you're an idiot</v>
<v Speaker 1>log has that.</v>

94
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>You're identifying really hard with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>

95
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.510
<v Speaker 1>The problem is if something comes up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>confront it,</v>

96
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you act?</v>

97
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.520
<v Speaker 1>What you can't let go with the plan </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you drown.</v>

98
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.480
<v Speaker 1>When you cling to it rigidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's no good because then you </v>

99
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 1>can't learn anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then if that's you,</v>

100
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>you're a totalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to learn anything.</v>

101
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.870
<v Speaker 1>You're going to end up in something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's close enough to hell so that you </v>

102
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.300
<v Speaker 1>won't know the difference and you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>drag everyone along with you.</v>

103
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Now it's happened plenty of times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

104
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole story of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

105
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:47.530
<v Speaker 1>It happened over and over and over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it happens in people's states.</v>

106
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.730
<v Speaker 1>It happens in their business </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>

107
00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:53.170
<v Speaker 1>It happens in their cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens in their provinces,</v>

108
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.620
<v Speaker 1>it happens in their states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it happens in their psyches all at </v>

109
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.341
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't blame the manifestation of </v>

110
00:05:02.341 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing on any of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>

111
00:05:03.131 --> 00:05:06.070
<v Speaker 1>It happens when a society goes down that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

112
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 1>It goes down everywhere at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

113
00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:13.081
<v Speaker 1>It's not the totalitarians at the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the happy people striving to be </v>

114
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:14.140
<v Speaker 1>free at the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that at all.</v>

115
00:05:14.141 --> 00:05:16.900
<v Speaker 1>It's totalitarianism at every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of the hierarchy,</v>

116
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.230
<v Speaker 1>including the psychological and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be the thing.</v>

117
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be in chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure,</v>

118
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:27.001
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to be the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>clings so desperately to the raft that </v>

119
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:28.780
<v Speaker 1>you can't let go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone comes to rescue you,</v>

120
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be that,</v>

121
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>so then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

122
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:34.840
<v Speaker 1>exactly what are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not the chaos.</v>

123
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:35.890
<v Speaker 1>You're not the plan.</v>

124
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're the thing that confronts </v>
<v Speaker 1>the obstacle,</v>

125
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.660
<v Speaker 1>and I would say that's the categorical </v>
<v Speaker 1>lesson of of psychology in so far as it </v>

126
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:51.631
<v Speaker 1>has to do with personal transformation </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what you always teach </v>

127
00:05:51.631 --> 00:05:54.871
<v Speaker 1>people in psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what sort of </v>

128
00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:56.580
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapist you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always teaching them the same </v>

129
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.580
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the thing that can.</v>

130
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.920
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the planned.</v>

131
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.950
<v Speaker 1>You're the thing that can confront the </v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacle to the plant and then when you </v>

132
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 1>know even further that the obstacle is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not only an obstacle,</v>

133
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:09.191
<v Speaker 1>but opportunity itself will then your </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole view of the world can change </v>

134
00:06:09.191 --> 00:06:09.260
<v Speaker 1>because you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

135
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 1>I've got this planned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something came up to object to it.</v>

136
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:17.021
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's possible that the thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's objecting has something to teach </v>

137
00:06:17.021 --> 00:06:18.350
<v Speaker 1>you that will take you to the place </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you develop it.</v>

138
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Even better plant and it's a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>framework to use.</v>

139
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you so sure that this is a problem?</v>

140
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>Is that the only way that you can look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at it?</v>

141
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Or is it an opportunity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

142
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 1>naive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic.</v>

144
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.250
<v Speaker 1>There are some things that's pretty hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>to extract gold from some dragons and </v>

145
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.220
<v Speaker 1>maybe the death of a family member is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good example of that.</v>

146
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.550
<v Speaker 1>But even in a situation like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that it's an opportunity </v>

147
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an opportunity for maturation,</v>

148
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is you might say,</v>

149
00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:52.121
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty miserable to go to be </v>

150
00:06:52.121 --> 00:06:52.121
<v Speaker 1>digging for gold when someone's falling </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the grave.</v>

151
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they really love you,</v>

152
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they'll want you to do,</v>

153
00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.700
<v Speaker 1>and second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to make their death a lot </v>

154
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.070
<v Speaker 1>more palatable experience for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're someone who can be in the room</v>

155
00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 1>and be helpful instead of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:07.691
<v Speaker 1>quivering in the corner and feeling that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire world is collapsing in on </v>

157
00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:07.691
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

158
00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:07.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another.</v>

159
00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:09.980
<v Speaker 1>You want to be the useful person at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>funeral.</v>

160
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.950
<v Speaker 1>How's that for a goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good goal,</v>

161
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:17.951
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that you've got yourself </v>

162
00:07:17.951 --> 00:07:20.051
<v Speaker 1>together in a situation like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to be after and </v>

163
00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:21.890
<v Speaker 1>maybe you want to be the person on whose</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder people cry.</v>

164
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.500
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a good goal and it's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't like being naively optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I tell you to get your life </v>

166
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.710
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say roses and sunshine.</v>

167
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

168
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

169
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:38.050
<v Speaker 1>that's Pablum for fools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it really is something to be the </v>

170
00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.150
<v Speaker 1>reliable person at a funeral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

171
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.300
<v Speaker 1>And you can aim it that you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be tough to do that because it</v>

172
00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:49.301
<v Speaker 1>also means that you can sustain a major </v>
<v Speaker 1>loss without collapsing and that you've </v>

173
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 1>got to be a monster to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
