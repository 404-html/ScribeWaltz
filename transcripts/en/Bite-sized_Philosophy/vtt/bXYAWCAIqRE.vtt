1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.910
<v Speaker 2>you if you can elaborate a bit on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned you talked about this </v>

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 2>mental process where people do the thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hard but less,</v>

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.370
<v Speaker 2>less hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but still basically shadow.</v>

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 2>That's actually a really productive way </v>
<v Speaker 2>of procrastinating,</v>

6
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:21.870
<v Speaker 2>although it comes with its own problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>of rationalization,</v>

7
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.320
<v Speaker 2>so reinforces certain circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll put it in a way that says that </v>

8
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.730
<v Speaker 2>those can go away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you need to bring up the.</v>

9
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.640
<v Speaker 2>The other inhibitory circuits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just wondering if you could elaborate.</v>

10
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can sure is in the realm of </v>

11
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.670
<v Speaker 2>possibility around their understanding </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

12
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've derived out partly from my study of</v>

13
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:44.090
<v Speaker 2>addiction and also from my study of</v>

14
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.860
<v Speaker 1>recovery from posttraumatic stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>

15
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.920
<v Speaker 1>but let's talk about addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a series of actions that </v>

16
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.660
<v Speaker 1>occur before you take your cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of those are local.</v>

17
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 1>They are the things that happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately before and some of those are</v>

18
00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:07.151
<v Speaker 1>distal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're farther back in the chain of </v>

19
00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>events and when you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have a hit of cocaine,</v>

20
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.450
<v Speaker 1>it produces a dopaminergic burst and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that feels really good,</v>

21
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:15.860
<v Speaker 1>but it also makes the circuits that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately active before that grow.</v>

22
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 1>That's what reinforcement is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the growth is proportionate,</v>

23
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.870
<v Speaker 1>not linearly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's proportionate to how long </v>

24
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.470
<v Speaker 1>before that event occurred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The closer it is,</v>

25
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:32.471
<v Speaker 1>the stronger they're going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even the ones that are somewhat </v>

26
00:01:32.471 --> 00:01:33.230
<v Speaker 1>distal get some reinforcement because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

27
00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:35.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you do before you,</v>

28
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.630
<v Speaker 1>you found your latest fix?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>

29
00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:39.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long before?</v>

30
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the closer,</v>

31
00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:44.540
<v Speaker 1>the more reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens then is that,</v>

32
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.480
<v Speaker 1>so if you take that person out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal environment,</v>

33
00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:50.760
<v Speaker 1>you put them into a treatment center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're off.</v>

34
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.770
<v Speaker 1>They're a physical addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a weird thing in the case of </v>

35
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.950
<v Speaker 1>cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like not that long a week.</v>

36
00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:02.090
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it two weeks for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even heroin and alcohol for sure,</v>

37
00:02:02.091 --> 00:02:04.760
<v Speaker 1>if you can get them through the seizure </v>
<v Speaker 1>part without dying.</v>

38
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they're done.</v>

39
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.160
<v Speaker 1>They're physiologically dependent </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

40
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.220
<v Speaker 1>But you let that person go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing that happens is his </v>

41
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.530
<v Speaker 1>old friend who he's always out doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs with shows up and bang,</v>

42
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:23.531
<v Speaker 1>he's craving like mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because that thing is in an </v>

43
00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:27.131
<v Speaker 1>area is not dead at all and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>activated by the queue and it's,</v>

44
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

45
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It only wants one thing at once.</v>

46
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to suppress any non related </v>

47
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.410
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and it'll use lies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's no problem.</v>

48
00:02:39.411 --> 00:02:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Especially if lies have been reinforced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they certainly have.</v>

49
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Where are you off to sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you'll have a live for that and</v>

50
00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:50.990
<v Speaker 1>then 10 minutes later you have your drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that little lie has just grown.</v>

51
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.260
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you think you've tried to quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think to hell with it.</v>

52
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:57.860
<v Speaker 1>And every time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes before you take your drug,</v>

53
00:02:57.861 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 1>you think to hell with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you do that a thousand times.</v>

54
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Well believe me that to hell with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>circuit,</v>

55
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.400
<v Speaker 1>that sucker is strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's alive and it's not like it </v>

56
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.170
<v Speaker 1>just disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't,</v>

57
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 1>it's you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's grown in there.</v>

58
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Now you can build another circuit to </v>
<v Speaker 1>shut it down and you can help decompose </v>

59
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 1>across time by not giving it what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants,</v>

60
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.920
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have to not give it </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it wants in all of the multiple </v>

61
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>contexts that you've already associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the drug.</v>

62
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Some of you probably smoked and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to quit smoking and what you'll </v>

63
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.800
<v Speaker 1>see is you get a craving when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

64
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 1>when you have a cup of coffee or when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're finished dinner,</v>

65
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:40.051
<v Speaker 1>when you're done having a phone call or </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you first get up in the morning or </v>

66
00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:43.200
<v Speaker 1>whenever you've regularly had the drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you had the drug in </v>

67
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.641
<v Speaker 1>relationship to even complex things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>ending a conversation will produce a </v>

68
00:03:47.641 --> 00:03:51.951
<v Speaker 1>cute craving and so then that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>extinguish overtime if you punish it by </v>

69
00:03:51.951 --> 00:03:55.290
<v Speaker 1>either punishing it or not letting it </v>
<v Speaker 1>get what it's wants,</v>

70
00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.530
<v Speaker 1>but a lot you have to build another </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuit to just shut it down and then </v>

71
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 1>that circuits kind of fragile and stress</v>
<v Speaker 1>can often disrupt it.</v>

72
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

73
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.470
<v Speaker 2>that can be read about quitting smoking </v>
<v Speaker 2>or things like,</v>

74
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.960
<v Speaker 1>oh sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

75
00:04:09.961 --> 00:04:10.560
<v Speaker 1>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

76
00:04:10.561 --> 00:04:15.561
<v Speaker 1>I begins a whole different thing because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to have a direct physiological </v>

77
00:04:15.561 --> 00:04:15.660
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

78
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.220
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

79
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.280
<v Speaker 1>the addiction has a cognitive component.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's full of thoughts and desires and </v>

80
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.310
<v Speaker 1>wants and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may have to build,</v>

81
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.580
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may have to rebuild your whole </v>

82
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.740
<v Speaker 1>personality in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get that thing cornered.</v>

83
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Religious conversion for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in a really effective treatment for </v>

84
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.671
<v Speaker 1>alcoholism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's partly why alcoholic alcoholics </v>

85
00:04:37.671 --> 00:04:38.700
<v Speaker 1>anonymous works for the people for whom </v>
<v Speaker 1>it does work,</v>

86
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.330
<v Speaker 1>but religious conversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is total personality conversion is</v>

87
00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:47.331
<v Speaker 1>actually one of the few things that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know of that's an effective treatment </v>

88
00:04:47.331 --> 00:04:48.030
<v Speaker 1>for alcoholism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to induce it,</v>

89
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.570
<v Speaker 1>but although that's not exactly true </v>
<v Speaker 1>either because I'm in the early work </v>

90
00:04:53.851 --> 00:04:57.520
<v Speaker 1>with Lsd was lsd was quite promising as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a treatment for,</v>

91
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 1>for an alcohol addiction and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent work with silicide button's </v>

92
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.000
<v Speaker 1>showing that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people have a mystical experience </v>

93
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.701
<v Speaker 1>when you give them Psilocybin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their success rate and quitting smoking </v>

94
00:05:10.701 --> 00:05:13.851
<v Speaker 1>is about 80 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is way higher than any </v>

95
00:05:13.851 --> 00:05:14.130
<v Speaker 1>pharmacological intervention for smoking</v>
<v Speaker 1>has ever beat.</v>

96
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.110
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

97
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.440
<v Speaker 1>We should probably call it a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll see you in a week.</v>
