1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.840
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole set of expectations that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are governing what we're doing,</v>

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.410
<v Speaker 1>like you don't want me to take your your</v>
<v Speaker 1>little tablet there and smash it.</v>

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>That would be shocking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:11.370
<v Speaker 1>You would know what the hell to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.400
<v Speaker 1>You'd be somewhere different if I did </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and you wouldn't know where you </v>

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.261
<v Speaker 1>were and that's another thing to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's a fundamental difference.</v>

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.440
<v Speaker 1>There is a fundamental difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between knowing where you are and not </v>

8
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:32.541
<v Speaker 1>knowing where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in some sense the </v>

9
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:36.470
<v Speaker 1>fundamental difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think about it as the </v>

10
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.470
<v Speaker 1>distinction between explored an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory,</v>

11
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>but you have to.</v>

12
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever taken a cat </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a new house.</v>

13
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Cats hate that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because in their old house and maybe</v>

14
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:56.441
<v Speaker 1>in their old neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they slunk around at the edges,</v>

15
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 1>checking everything out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start out freight afraid.</v>

16
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.630
<v Speaker 1>They check everything out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know where to hide.</v>

17
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.620
<v Speaker 1>They know where to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew,</v>

18
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.650
<v Speaker 1>they knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know what safe and they know that </v>

19
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.051
<v Speaker 1>because they go somewhere and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens and so then the assuming that </v>

20
00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:14.351
<v Speaker 1>it's safe and they slowly build up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood that they're comfortable </v>

21
00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:19.271
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad used to take the dog for a walk </v>

22
00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:22.031
<v Speaker 1>and then the cat got lonesome and so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>started to follow him and first of all </v>

23
00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:23.420
<v Speaker 1>it would just go along the buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the houses on their route,</v>

24
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>no hiding really from predators and </v>
<v Speaker 1>after awhile it got kinda comfortable </v>

25
00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:32.000
<v Speaker 1>with that and then it would follow right</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the dog,</v>

26
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.390
<v Speaker 1>but it had a border and if my dad took </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dog over one street too many for the</v>

27
00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:41.940
<v Speaker 1>cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cat would just sit on the corner and</v>

28
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cry like a cap cries.</v>

29
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.750
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it for me,</v>

30
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:52.751
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going any farther out into the </v>

31
00:01:52.751 --> 00:01:55.391
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the distinction between the </v>

32
00:01:55.391 --> 00:02:00.221
<v Speaker 1>territory that you have mastered and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory that you haven't mastered is a</v>

33
00:02:01.311 --> 00:02:06.311
<v Speaker 1>fundamental distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the distinction between home and </v>

34
00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:10.540
<v Speaker 1>the strange land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about familiar territory </v>

35
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.950
<v Speaker 1>for people is that most of the familiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory that we inhabit is other </v>

36
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.031
<v Speaker 1>people because we're so social.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't really think it's a weird </v>

37
00:02:19.031 --> 00:02:23.441
<v Speaker 1>way of thinking about territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly geographical objective </v>

38
00:02:23.441 --> 00:02:27.611
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's territory with a dominance </v>

39
00:02:27.611 --> 00:02:31.001
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy in it and the dominance </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy has a predictable structure </v>

40
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:32.150
<v Speaker 1>and you know where you fit in it most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

41
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.470
<v Speaker 1>And so that when you act out in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory surrounded by Europe,</v>

42
00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:40.471
<v Speaker 1>people then often you get what you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're so thrilled about that </v>

43
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:44.120
<v Speaker 1>because you just don't want someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>acting radically around you.</v>

44
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know that.</v>

45
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:50.801
<v Speaker 1>So he walked down bloor and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>people there that should really be </v>

46
00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:55.671
<v Speaker 1>institutionalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we did institutionalize them all so </v>

47
00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:57.210
<v Speaker 1>they could be free and free to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.280
<v Speaker 1>suffering and malfunctioning out on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

49
00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:03.360
<v Speaker 1>That's what the freedom ended up being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

50
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 1>you'll walk by someone like that who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>moderating away to the voices in his </v>

51
00:03:09.621 --> 00:03:10.160
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>

52
00:03:10.161 --> 00:03:10.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe</v>

53
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>striking out against whatever it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's plaguing him.</v>

54
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:21.121
<v Speaker 1>And you will make eye contact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might even go across the street,</v>

55
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 1>you're certainly going to give him a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wide berth.</v>

56
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:28.741
<v Speaker 1>You're going to keep a distance between </v>
<v Speaker 1>him and you and you're going to hope </v>

57
00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:33.721
<v Speaker 1>that you don't attract his attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's not in the dominance </v>

58
00:03:33.721 --> 00:03:38.011
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and you don't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell he might do and that's unexplored </v>

59
00:03:38.011 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>territory too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it,</v>

60
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:45.901
<v Speaker 1>like we inhabit time and space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just space and not just time.</v>

61
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>We inhabit time and space and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>territories are spacial.</v>

62
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:55.801
<v Speaker 1>Temporal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're here now and this is safe now and </v>

63
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>it saved partly because of the physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and it's working,</v>

64
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's also safe because none of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are manifesting peculiar behavior,</v>

65
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 1>but if you started to manifest peculiar </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

66
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.620
<v Speaker 1>if you stood up and started monitoring </v>
<v Speaker 1>or yelling or maybe attacking someone </v>

67
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.331
<v Speaker 1>next to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the rest of you would freeze first </v>

68
00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 1>because then all of a sudden this would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be unexplored territory.</v>

69
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.070
<v Speaker 1>The match between what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a peaceful lecture that you </v>

70
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.701
<v Speaker 1>hope has some content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The match between what you want and </v>

71
00:04:30.171 --> 00:04:34.460
<v Speaker 1>what's happening has vanished and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're not.</v>

72
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.810
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where you are and so then</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do when you don't know where</v>

73
00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:43.811
<v Speaker 1>you are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do when you don't know what </v>

74
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:43.811
<v Speaker 1>to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

75
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:44.600
<v Speaker 1>if you're your computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just crash,</v>

76
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.610
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

77
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
<v Speaker 1>you know what good is that to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just going to die.</v>

78
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.180
<v Speaker 1>That isn't helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You freeze first and then maybe you </v>

79
00:04:56.811 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>cautiously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cautiously attended,</v>

80
00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:03.481
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you just keep your damn eyes </v>

81
00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:03.481
<v Speaker 1>averted and you sit there and you hope </v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one notices you.</v>

82
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.080
<v Speaker 1>That's a Predator or prey response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

83
00:05:06.081 --> 00:05:11.081
<v Speaker 1>That's like a rabbit frozen when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks a fox is looking at it and we </v>

84
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:14.681
<v Speaker 1>were prey animals for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a cat that they recently </v>

85
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:19.571
<v Speaker 1>discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a prehistoric cat that had this bottom </v>

86
00:05:19.571 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>single tooth and they found out that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human skull fit right inside its mouth </v>

87
00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:27.860
<v Speaker 1>and so it could grab you here and Pierce</v>
<v Speaker 1>the back of your skull with its with its</v>

88
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.500
<v Speaker 1>single tooth and that's what it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved for.</v>

89
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.830
<v Speaker 1>So you know it's under such conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We evolved and we're predators </v>

90
00:05:37.941 --> 00:05:42.941
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but were tasty predators and so other </v>

91
00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:45.911
<v Speaker 1>things were perfectly happy to eat us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when you're aware you don't know </v>

92
00:05:47.851 --> 00:05:52.851
<v Speaker 1>what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you act like a prey animal and that's </v>

93
00:05:52.851 --> 00:05:56.060
<v Speaker 1>probably what you shouldn't do because </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you keep your head down and </v>

94
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.300
<v Speaker 1>shut the hell up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be any attention to attracted to you and</v>

95
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll get through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

96
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.810
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might decide unlikely to intervene </v>

97
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.380
<v Speaker 1>and take the guy down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

98
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 1>but you would be the exception rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the norm.</v>

99
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 1>And it's unsurprising.</v>
