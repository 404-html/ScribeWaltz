1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.540
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I've been struck </v>

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.500
<v Speaker 1>very hard by a number of writers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Young,</v>

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.780
<v Speaker 1>obviously among them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he,</v>

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.260
<v Speaker 1>he wrote things like Nicha that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand them,</v>

5
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>they just break you into pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.510
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that young </v>

7
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.611
<v Speaker 1>understood in the psychoanalysts </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it's one of the most </v>

8
00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:25.071
<v Speaker 1>terrifying elements of psychoanalytic </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking is very tightly allied with </v>

9
00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:29.240
<v Speaker 1>religious thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that you are not the master of </v>

10
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.151
<v Speaker 1>your own house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are spirits that dwelling within </v>

11
00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:35.721
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning you have a will and you can </v>

12
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:38.340
<v Speaker 1>exercise a certain amount of conscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>control over your being,</v>

13
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:43.341
<v Speaker 1>but there are all sorts of things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>occur within you that seemed to be </v>

14
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>beyond your capacity to control your </v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams.</v>

15
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:45.900
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good example.</v>

16
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Are Your impulses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

17
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:52.311
<v Speaker 1>you might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think of those as so foreign </v>

18
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:52.311
<v Speaker 1>from you that they're not even.</v>

19
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:52.311
<v Speaker 1>You don't even want them to be part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

20
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more subtly even.</v>

21
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>How about what you're interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what compels you?</v>

22
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does that come from?</v>

23
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you can't.</v>

24
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:06.441
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't conjure it up of your own </v>

25
00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:06.441
<v Speaker 1>accord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 1>so if you're a student in your taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult course,</v>

27
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>you might say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>I need to sit down and study for three </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>

29
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>but then you sit down and that is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

30
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Your attention goes everywhere and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>

31
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:18.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose attention is it?</v>

32
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:23.091
<v Speaker 1>Then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it goes everywhere because you say </v>

33
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:23.091
<v Speaker 1>it's your attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

34
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's your attention,</v>

35
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 1>maybe you will be able to control it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't.</v>

36
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.790
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well jen and just exactly what the hell </v>

37
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.790
<v Speaker 1>is controlling it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

38
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's random.</v>

39
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 1>It's better not be random.</v>

40
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.300
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens to some degree in </v>

41
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.031
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an element of randomness in </v>

42
00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:41.031
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not random,</v>

43
00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:45.590
<v Speaker 1>it's driven by the action of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of phenomena that I think are best </v>

44
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>considered as something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>subpersonalities or they'll even.</v>

45
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:52.821
<v Speaker 1>That's only a partial description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't make yourself interested in </v>

46
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:58.401
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interest manifests itself in grips you.</v>

47
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.490
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what is it that's gripping you </v>

48
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>and how do you conceptualize that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a divine power?</v>

49
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's defined as far as you're concerned </v>

50
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.930
<v Speaker 1>because it grips you and you can't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything about it,</v>

51
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.840
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a calling in you towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're compelled by and what you're</v>

52
00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>interested in that sometimes that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be very dark and sometimes not,</v>

53
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.010
<v Speaker 1>but you're compelled forward by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest and so and so the idea that </v>

54
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>what moves you away from your country </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your father's house and the comforts</v>

55
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:35.751
<v Speaker 1>of your childhood home is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is something that's beyond you and that </v>

56
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:35.751
<v Speaker 1>you listened to and Harken to.</v>

57
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.890
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>

58
00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:39.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to call that God.</v>

59
00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like it doesn't matter what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>call it.</v>

60
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter to what it is,</v>

61
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>what it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It still is,</v>

62
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.660
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't listen to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the other thing.</v>

63
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.960
<v Speaker 1>If you don't listen to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've been a clinician and talked to </v>

64
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>enough people now as old as I am to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

65
00:02:57.361 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do not to that thing that beckons</v>

66
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:05.251
<v Speaker 1>you forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will pay for it like you cannot </v>

67
00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:07.770
<v Speaker 1>possibly imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll have everything that's terrible </v>

68
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>about life in your life and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it that's good and worse.</v>

69
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.570
<v Speaker 1>You'll know that it was your fault and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you squandered what you could have </v>

70
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.570
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>
