1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.420
<v Speaker 1>He wrote these books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notebooks that haven't been published </v>

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.831
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the black books and the black </v>

3
00:00:09.831 --> 00:00:12.291
<v Speaker 1>books are the documentation of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments with his imagination and </v>

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.110
<v Speaker 1>what he would do is daydream like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a child daydreams.</v>

5
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.910
<v Speaker 1>He regained that faculty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I think with you,</v>

6
00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>and it was a faculty that has never </v>
<v Speaker 1>really disappeared and he had figures of</v>

7
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:29.811
<v Speaker 1>imagination that came to him that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>could speak with and he spoke with these</v>

8
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:34.470
<v Speaker 1>figures of imagination and documented </v>
<v Speaker 1>that over a very long period of time.</v>

9
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.950
<v Speaker 1>And that was originally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was eventually distilled into a </v>

10
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:46.521
<v Speaker 1>book called the Red Book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was published about three or four </v>

11
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a book that young regarded as</v>

12
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:53.091
<v Speaker 1>the central source from which all his </v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiration emerged.</v>

13
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>It was sort of the way it looks to me is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we embody a lot of information in </v>

14
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 1>our action.</v>

15
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And our action has developed as a </v>

16
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.691
<v Speaker 1>consequence of imitating other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not only the people or the people </v>

17
00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:16.281
<v Speaker 1>around us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course the people around us </v>

18
00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:16.281
<v Speaker 1>imitated the people who came before them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those people in imitated.</v>

19
00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:20.811
<v Speaker 1>The people who came before them and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>on so far back that it's as far back as </v>

20
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:25.761
<v Speaker 1>you can go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you embody these patterns of </v>

21
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>behavior that are extremely informative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't understand,</v>

22
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.630
<v Speaker 1>that are a consequence of collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>invitation across the centuries and </v>

23
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.661
<v Speaker 1>throw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then those patterns can become manifest </v>

24
00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:39.111
<v Speaker 1>as figures of the imagination and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>failures of imagination are the </v>

25
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:44.151
<v Speaker 1>distillations of patterns of behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so as the distillations of patterns </v>

26
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:50.961
<v Speaker 1>of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have content and it's not you that </v>

27
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:53.961
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's you could even think about it as </v>

28
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 1>content that's evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it's culturally transmitted.</v>

29
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:59.271
<v Speaker 1>It's content that's evolved and so these</v>
<v Speaker 1>figures of the imagination can reveal </v>

30
00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:04.070
<v Speaker 1>the structure of reality to you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened with young and </v>

31
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.541
<v Speaker 1>that's what he described in the red book</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was what permeated his </v>

32
00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:08.541
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>

33
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was based on the presupposition </v>

34
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.140
<v Speaker 1>that the fundamental architectural </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures of religious belief.</v>

35
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>We're not pathological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not deceitful,</v>

36
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.570
<v Speaker 1>not protective in some delusional sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the fear of death,</v>

37
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.810
<v Speaker 1>but quite the contrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The very stories that enabled us to move</v>

38
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:35.271
<v Speaker 1>forward as confident human beings in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>face of chaos itself and it's </v>

39
00:02:37.141 --> 00:02:42.141
<v Speaker 1>conceivable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think perhaps probable that nothing </v>

40
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:47.421
<v Speaker 1>more important conceptually happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century than that because it </v>

41
00:02:49.351 --> 00:02:54.351
<v Speaker 1>was the first time post enlightenment </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Ab rapprochement between the </v>

42
00:02:55.681 --> 00:03:00.681
<v Speaker 1>intellect and the underlying religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetipal occurred.</v>

43
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.690
<v Speaker 1>You have in the capacious intellect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>young and the same thing happened to </v>

44
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.531
<v Speaker 1>some degree with piaget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The religious domain and the factual </v>

45
00:03:10.531 --> 00:03:14.851
<v Speaker 1>domain were brought back together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact of young's enduring and </v>

46
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.180
<v Speaker 1>increasing popularity and influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say is a direct consequence of </v>

47
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.081
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now some of his work was spun off into </v>

48
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:31.501
<v Speaker 1>the new age and the new age is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic and naive movement.</v>

49
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>It's predicated on the idea that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>do nothing say,</v>

50
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:39.931
<v Speaker 1>but follow your bliss and that will take</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever hire to enlightenment.</v>

51
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:45.031
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the union idea at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The union idea is that what you most </v>

52
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:50.170
<v Speaker 1>need will be found where you least want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to look.</v>

53
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>So there's this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>King Arthur,</v>

54
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 1>there's this story of King Arthur the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all in round table,</v>

55
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>King Arthur and his knights,</v>

56
00:03:57.431 --> 00:03:59.750
<v Speaker 1>they're all equals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all super ordinary,</v>

57
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>but they're all equals and they go off </v>
<v Speaker 1>to look for the holy grail from the holy</v>

58
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>grail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grail is the container of the redemptive</v>

59
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:12.031
<v Speaker 1>substance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is might be the cup the </v>

60
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>Christ used at the last supper might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a cellist that was used to capture his </v>

61
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 1>blood on the cross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right when he was pierced by a sword.</v>

62
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.140
<v Speaker 1>The stories differ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the holy grail and the holy </v>

63
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.140
<v Speaker 1>grail is lost.</v>

64
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.680
<v Speaker 1>That's the redemptive substance and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>knights of King Arthur go off to search </v>

65
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.520
<v Speaker 1>for the holy grail and but they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know where to look.</v>

66
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.030
<v Speaker 1>So where do you look when you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>where to look for something you need </v>

67
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.530
<v Speaker 1>desperately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've lost.</v>

68
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of the nights goes into the forest </v>

69
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.231
<v Speaker 1>at the point that looks darkest to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's union psychoanalysis in a </v>

70
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:51.541
<v Speaker 1>nutshell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that which you fear and avoid </v>

71
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:55.261
<v Speaker 1>that which you hold in contempt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that which disgusts you and that you </v>

72
00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:59.491
<v Speaker 1>avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the gateway to what you need to </v>

73
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing new agey about that,</v>

74
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.960
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
