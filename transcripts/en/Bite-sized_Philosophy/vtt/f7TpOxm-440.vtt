00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Why don't the feminist complain about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia?</v>

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:03.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gad Saad,</v>

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.920
<v Speaker 1>who's this guy at Concordia who is in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>business school so he can actually say </v>

5
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.270
<v Speaker 1>what he thinks now and then he tweeted </v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday,</v>

6
00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:22.180
<v Speaker 1>well he tweeted to the woman's march,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.240
<v Speaker 1>because there's little twitter thing you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could do that I suppose for the </v>

8
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.240
<v Speaker 1>organizers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

9
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.900
<v Speaker 1>why don't you go to the Middle East and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a nice march again,</v>

10
00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia and see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see how that works out for ya?</v>

11
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you think,</v>

12
00:00:34.271 --> 00:00:35.870
<v Speaker 1>well why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

13
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:36.790
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

14
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Why are the why or the radical leftists </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are so much for rights everywhere.</v>

15
00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:46.051
<v Speaker 1>That's what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't they complaining about Saudi </v>

16
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:46.051
<v Speaker 1>Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

17
00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breeds a particularly pathological form </v>

18
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.780
<v Speaker 1>of ideologically rigid his lap basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>in slaves.</v>

19
00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:55.210
<v Speaker 1>They're women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's to put it properly.</v>

20
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not complaining about that?</v>

21
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about this?</v>

22
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>The enemy of my enemy is my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when push comes to shove,</v>

23
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>you see how much concern there is among </v>
<v Speaker 1>the radical feminists for the rights of </v>

24
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.100
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if,</v>

25
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>if the pushing those rights forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't also at the same time under a </v>

26
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 1>undermine the western patriarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll take the undermining and </v>

27
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.521
<v Speaker 1>leave the damn rights behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's an insight for you about </v>

28
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:25.210
<v Speaker 1>exactly what's going on at the bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this.</v>
