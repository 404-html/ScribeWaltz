00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>The next best predictor of lifetime </v>
<v Speaker 1>success is conscientiousness,</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.780
<v Speaker 1>while so and of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the two aspects of conscientiousness </v>

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>say orderliness and industriousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The better predictor is industriousness.</v>

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>what can you do about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>industriousness?</v>

6
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.780
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's kind of rough too because </v>

7
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.380
<v Speaker 1>there's a strong genetic component,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can work on micro habits with </v>

8
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>regards to your conscientiousness and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the best micro habits.</v>

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 1>This is partly to do with this future </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring program processes.</v>

10
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:36.621
<v Speaker 1>I think the best thing you can do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to your conscientiousness is to </v>

11
00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:40.020
<v Speaker 1>set up some aims for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goals that you actually value and the </v>

12
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>future authoring program helps people do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and basically it does a situational</v>

13
00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:49.521
<v Speaker 1>analysis of it helps you do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situational analysis of your life more </v>

14
00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>than a psychological analysis I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

15
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>And so the questions are something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

16
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.580
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to put some effort </v>

17
00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>into your life and you need to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated to do that.</v>

18
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 1>And so what are the potential sources of</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation?</v>

19
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.930
<v Speaker 1>You could think about them in the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>five manner.</v>

20
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>If you're extroverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want friends,</v>

21
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>if you're agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want an intimate relationship.</v>

22
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>If you're disagreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to win competitions.</v>

23
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>If you're open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to engage in creative activity.</v>

24
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>If you're high in neuroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want security.</v>

25
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are all sources of potential </v>

26
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 1>motivation that you could draw on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could tailor to your own,</v>

27
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own personality.</v>

28
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 1>But then there are dimensions that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to consider your life across.</v>

29
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:29.070
<v Speaker 1>And so we ask people about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

30
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could have your life the way you </v>

31
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.691
<v Speaker 1>wanted it in three to five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were taking care of yourself </v>

32
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:35.691
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Speaker 1>what would you want from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendships?</v>

34
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>What would you want from your intimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship?</v>

35
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 1>How would you like to structure your </v>
<v Speaker 1>family?</v>

36
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.050
<v Speaker 1>What do you want for your career?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to use your time </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of your job and how are you </v>

38
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.430
<v Speaker 1>going to regulate your mental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical,</v>

39
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.600
<v Speaker 1>mental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and physical health,</v>

40
00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.640
<v Speaker 1>and maybe also your drug and alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

41
00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good place to Auger down,</v>

42
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because alcoholism,</v>

43
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wipes out,</v>

44
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five to 10 percent of people,</v>

45
00:01:56.791 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>so you want to keep that under control </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

46
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>and then so maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

47
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>you develop a vision of what your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you would like your life to be and </v>

48
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.051
<v Speaker 1>that associates the so the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once the goal is established and then </v>

49
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:17.541
<v Speaker 1>you break down the goal into micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>processes that you could implement the </v>

50
00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:21.741
<v Speaker 1>microprocesses become rewarding in </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportion in relation to there a causal</v>

51
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.070
<v Speaker 1>association with the goal and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tangles in your,</v>

52
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 1>your incentive reward system.</v>

53
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.060
<v Speaker 1>We talked about the dopaminergic </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive reward system and that's the </v>

54
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.920
<v Speaker 1>thing that keeps you moving forward and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it works is that it works better</v>

55
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.310
<v Speaker 1>if it produces positive emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it can see you moving towards a </v>

56
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 1>valued goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

57
00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:46.191
<v Speaker 1>well what's the implication of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better have a valued goal because </v>

58
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:50.151
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you can't get any positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation working out and so the more </v>

59
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:53.721
<v Speaker 1>valuable the goal in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more the micro processes associated </v>

60
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>with that goal start to take on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive charge.</v>

61
00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.310
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is while you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in the morning and you're excited </v>

62
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.310
<v Speaker 1>about the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ready to go,</v>

63
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.940
<v Speaker 1>and so as far as I can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you specify your longterm</v>

64
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.960
<v Speaker 1>ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you also specify a place you want </v>

65
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.081
<v Speaker 1>to stay the hell away from so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're terrified to fail as well as </v>

66
00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:13.081
<v Speaker 1>excited about succeeding.</v>

67
00:03:13.081 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Because that's also useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You specify your goal.</v>

68
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 1>You do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that in some sense as a unique </v>

69
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want.</v>

70
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>You want to specify goals that make you </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

71
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that could happen as a consequence of</v>

72
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 1>my efforts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would clearly be worthwhile.</v>

73
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Because the question always is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do something?</v>

74
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Because doing nothing is easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just sit there and you don't do </v>

75
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.641
<v Speaker 1>anything that's real easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is why would you ever do </v>

76
00:03:38.641 --> 00:03:41.701
<v Speaker 1>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer that has to be because </v>

77
00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>you've determined by some means that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worthwhile.</v>

78
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>And then the next question might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

79
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 1>where should you look for worthwhile </v>
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>

80
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>And one would be while you can consult </v>
<v Speaker 1>your own temperament,</v>

81
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 1>and the other would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while you kind of look at how,</v>

82
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>look at what it is that people accrue </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's valuable across the lifespan.</v>

83
00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what you do,</v>

84
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:04.051
<v Speaker 1>a structural analysis of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subcomponents of human existence and </v>

85
00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:04.051
<v Speaker 1>already did that.</v>

86
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 1>You need a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need friends,</v>

87
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Speaker 1>like you don't need to have all of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

88
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 1>but you better have most of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Family,</v>

89
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

90
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 1>educational goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plans for time outside of work,</v>

91
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>attention to your mental and physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>

92
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know those are,</v>

93
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.670
<v Speaker 1>that's what life is about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if You don't have any of those </v>

94
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.361
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then all you've got left is misery </v>

95
00:04:27.361 --> 00:04:27.361
<v Speaker 1>and suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

96
00:04:27.361 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad deal for you.</v>

97
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so once you,</v>

98
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 1>once you set up that goal structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

99
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>and that's really in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many ways,</v>

100
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:42.511
<v Speaker 1>that's what you should be doing at </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities is that's exactly what you </v>

101
00:04:42.511 --> 00:04:45.601
<v Speaker 1>should be doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is trying to figure out who it is that </v>

102
00:04:45.601 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

103
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.330
<v Speaker 1>And you aim at that and then use </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you learned as a means of </v>

104
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 1>building that person that you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

105
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.900
<v Speaker 1>And and I really mean want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean should be even those </v>

106
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.861
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things are going to overlap and </v>

107
00:05:01.861 --> 00:05:02.170
<v Speaker 1>it's important to distinguish between </v>
<v Speaker 1>those because that's partly,</v>

108
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>and this is back down to the micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>routine analysis.</v>

109
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:05.110
<v Speaker 1>So I started saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

110
00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 1>you're going to try to make yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>more industrious.</v>

111
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

112
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 1>specify your damn goals because how are </v>
<v Speaker 1>you going to hit something if you don't </v>

113
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.910
<v Speaker 1>know what it is that isn't going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>

114
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.180
<v Speaker 1>And often people won't specify their </v>
<v Speaker 1>goals too because they don't like to </v>

115
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.151
<v Speaker 1>specify conditions for failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you keep yourself all vague and </v>

116
00:05:21.151 --> 00:05:22.300
<v Speaker 1>foggy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is real easy because that's just a</v>

117
00:05:22.301 --> 00:05:25.210
<v Speaker 1>matter of not doing as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't know when you fail.</v>

118
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 1>And people might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

119
00:05:26.801 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>I really don't want to know when I fail </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's painful,</v>

120
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 1>so I'll keep myself blind about when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>fail.</v>

121
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.300
<v Speaker 1>ThAt's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except you'll fail all the time.</v>

122
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:39.301
<v Speaker 1>Then you just won't know it until you </v>
<v Speaker 1>failed so badly that you're done and </v>

123
00:05:39.301 --> 00:05:40.810
<v Speaker 1>that can easily happen by the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're 40,</v>

124
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.590
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would recommend that you don't let </v>

125
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.590
<v Speaker 1>that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's willful blindness,</v>

126
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.361
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could have known but you chose not </v>

127
00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:51.361
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

128
00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 1>So once you get your goal structure set </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

129
00:05:51.641 --> 00:05:52.210
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

130
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:57.211
<v Speaker 1>if I could have this life looks like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that might be worth living despite the </v>

131
00:05:57.211 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 1>fact that it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.100
<v Speaker 1>anxiety provoking and threatening and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be some suffering and </v>

133
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.831
<v Speaker 1>loss involved in all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the goal is to have a vision </v>

134
00:06:05.831 --> 00:06:10.451
<v Speaker 1>for your life such that all things </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered that justifies your effort.</v>

135
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then what do you do?</v>

136
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Well then then you turn down to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>micro routines.</v>

137
00:06:16.321 --> 00:06:16.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

138
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 1>well this is what I'm aiming for.</v>

139
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.230
<v Speaker 1>How does that instantiate itself day to </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

140
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 1>week to week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>month to month.</v>

141
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's where something like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>schedule can be unbelievably useful.</v>

142
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 1>google calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like make a damn schedule and stick</v>

143
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

144
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 1>So what's the rule with the schedule?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bloody prison.</v>

145
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing that people do </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

146
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

147
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't like to follow a schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

148
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of schedule are you setting </v>

149
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.080
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

150
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.080
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to do this.</v>

151
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.330
<v Speaker 1>Then I have to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I have to do this,</v>

152
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.870
<v Speaker 1>and then I just go play video games </v>
<v Speaker 1>because who wants to do all these things</v>

153
00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:49.820
<v Speaker 1>that I have to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like wrong.</v>

154
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Set the damn schedule up so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the day you want.</v>

155
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:55.760
<v Speaker 1>That's the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

156
00:06:55.761 --> 00:06:56.930
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got tomorrow.</v>

157
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:02.140
<v Speaker 1>If I was going to set it up so it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best possible day I could have </v>

158
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.730
<v Speaker 1>practically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would it look like?</v>

159
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Well then you schedule that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's a bit of </v>

160
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that's going to go along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that because if you have any sense,</v>

161
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.390
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>insist upon is that at the end of the </v>

162
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.930
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not in worse shape than you were </v>

163
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.930
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

164
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Because that's a stupid day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a bunch of thoSe in a row,</v>

165
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:27.431
<v Speaker 1>you just dig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dig yourself a hole and then you bury </v>

166
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:27.431
<v Speaker 1>yourself in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

167
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:28.280
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not a good strategy,</v>

168
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.830
<v Speaker 1>bad strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe 20 percent of your day has to </v>

169
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>be responsibility and obligation or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's more than that,</v>

170
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:38.290
<v Speaker 1>depending on how far behind you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even that you can.</v>

171
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:39.740
<v Speaker 1>You can ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

172
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:43.610
<v Speaker 1>well I've got these responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to schedule the damn things in.</v>

173
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.180
<v Speaker 1>What's the right ratio of responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reward?</v>

174
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.390
<v Speaker 1>And you can ask yourself that just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd negotiate with someone who is </v>

175
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.390
<v Speaker 1>working for you.</v>

176
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.390
<v Speaker 1>It'S like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

177
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.450
<v Speaker 1>you got to work tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

178
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 1>so I want you to work tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

179
00:07:55.671 --> 00:08:00.671
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what are you going to do for me </v>

180
00:08:00.671 --> 00:08:00.671
<v Speaker 1>that makes it likely that I'll work for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

181
00:08:00.671 --> 00:08:02.300
<v Speaker 1>While you could ask yourself that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.380
<v Speaker 1>maybe you do an hour of of </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and then you play a video</v>

183
00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:07.820
<v Speaker 1>game for 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

184
00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:10.380
<v Speaker 1>whatever turns your crank man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

185
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.150
<v Speaker 1>you have to negotiate with yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not tyrannized yourself.</v>

186
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Like you're negotiating with someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you care for,</v>

187
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 1>that you would like to be productive and</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a good life,</v>

188
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:22.290
<v Speaker 1>and that's how you make the schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

189
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.690
<v Speaker 1>and then you look at the day and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

190
00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:24.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had that day,</v>

191
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:26.600
<v Speaker 1>that'd be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

192
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

193
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:32.620
<v Speaker 1>you're useless and horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you'll probably only hit it with </v>

194
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.800
<v Speaker 1>about 70 percent accuracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that beats the hell out of zero.</v>

195
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you hit it even with 50 percent </v>

196
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:39.520
<v Speaker 1>accuracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another rule is well,</v>

197
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.960
<v Speaker 1>aim for 51 percent the next week or 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half percent for god's sake or </v>

198
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:49.090
<v Speaker 1>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to hit that position where </v>

199
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.680
<v Speaker 1>things start to loop back positively in </v>
<v Speaker 1>spiral you upward and so,</v>

200
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:57.340
<v Speaker 1>so that's one way that you can work on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your conscientiousness is a plan a life </v>

201
00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.161
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to have and you do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly by referring to social norms.</v>

202
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 1>That's more or less rescuing your father</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the belly of the whale.</v>

203
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:09.801
<v Speaker 1>But the way other way you do that is by </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a little conversation with </v>

204
00:09:09.801 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 1>yourself about as if you don't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>know who you are,</v>

205
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:13.680
<v Speaker 1>because you know what you're like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't do what you're told,</v>

206
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.080
<v Speaker 1>you won't do what you tell yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

207
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:21.350
<v Speaker 1>You must have noticed that it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a bad employee and a worse boss </v>

208
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 1>and both of those work for you.</v>

209
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.180
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you tell yourself what to </v>

210
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:29.180
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't do it anyways.</v>

211
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.000
<v Speaker 1>You should fire yourself and find </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else to beat.</v>

212
00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.740
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

213
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.030
<v Speaker 1>My point is that you have to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not your own servant,</v>

214
00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:41.031
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're someone that you have to </v>

215
00:09:41.031 --> 00:09:42.621
<v Speaker 1>negotiate with and someone that you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to present the opportunity of having a </v>

216
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:48.651
<v Speaker 1>good life too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's hard for people because they </v>

217
00:09:48.651 --> 00:09:48.780
<v Speaker 1>don't like themselves very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

218
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:53.781
<v Speaker 1>they're always like cracking the whip </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then procrastinating and cracking </v>

219
00:09:53.781 --> 00:09:54.210
<v Speaker 1>the whip and then procrastinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

220
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:59.240
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so boring and such a pathetic way </v>

221
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.331
<v Speaker 1>of spending your time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what that's like because </v>

222
00:10:02.331 --> 00:10:04.281
<v Speaker 1>you probably waste like six hours a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think we did an economic </v>

223
00:10:04.281 --> 00:10:04.590
<v Speaker 1>calculation about that awhile back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

224
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Your time is probably worth 50 bucks an </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>

225
00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.190
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

226
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.800
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting paid that now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're young.</v>

227
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:16.070
<v Speaker 1>And so this is investment time and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do now is going to multiply its </v>

228
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:16.650
<v Speaker 1>effects in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

229
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.830
<v Speaker 1>so let's say it's 50 bucks an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is perfectly reasonable.</v>

230
00:10:19.831 --> 00:10:22.140
<v Speaker 1>So if you waste six hours a day and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

231
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.620
<v Speaker 1>then you're wasting about $2,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a week or about $100,000</v>

232
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:27.210
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like go ahead.</v>

233
00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:29.190
<v Speaker 1>But that's what it's costing you every </v>
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>

234
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.380
<v Speaker 1>And you need to know what your damn time</v>
<v Speaker 1>is worth.</v>

235
00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.780
<v Speaker 1>So let's say it's not 50 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 30,</v>

236
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:35.820
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's 100,</v>

237
00:10:35.821 --> 00:10:40.821
<v Speaker 1>it's somewhere in that range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you should be asking </v>

238
00:10:40.821 --> 00:10:41.250
<v Speaker 1>yourself is when you spend an hour was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

239
00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:46.251
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have I paid someone 50 bucks to </v>

240
00:10:46.251 --> 00:10:46.350
<v Speaker 1>have had that hour?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the answer is no,</v>

241
00:10:46.351 --> 00:10:46.980
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

242
00:10:46.981 --> 00:10:48.780
<v Speaker 1>maybe you should do something else with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your time.</v>

243
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 1>And it depends on whether or not you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that your time is worthwhile.</v>

244
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.980
<v Speaker 1>But the funny thing about not assuming </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is if you assume your time isn't </v>

245
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.311
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is you don't just sit </v>

246
00:11:01.311 --> 00:11:03.060
<v Speaker 1>around sort of randomly in a state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility list bliss.</v>

247
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.360
<v Speaker 1>What you do is you suffer existentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that seems like a stupid </v>

248
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:08.850
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>
