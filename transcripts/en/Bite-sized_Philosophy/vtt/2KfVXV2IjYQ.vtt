1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.810
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you a little story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is in my book,</v>

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.470
<v Speaker 1>so I had this landlord in Montreal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lived next door to me and he was an </v>

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.801
<v Speaker 1>ex hell's angels biker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd spent a lot of time in prison and </v>

4
00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:16.581
<v Speaker 1>his wife had borderline personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder and she committed suicide when </v>

5
00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:20.271
<v Speaker 1>I lived there and was a rough guy and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was at Caa Quebec law and he spoke to </v>

6
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.170
<v Speaker 1>you all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I could hardly understand.</v>

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.530
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't really know what to make of me</v>

8
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't really know what to make of</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

9
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.510
<v Speaker 1>but we got along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.140
<v Speaker 1>and I was very careful talking to him </v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

11
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.990
<v Speaker 1>as you might imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

12
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

13
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:41.001
<v Speaker 1>it was very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we went over to my wife and I went </v>

14
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.311
<v Speaker 1>over there and we had a spaghetti dinner</v>
<v Speaker 1>one night and we sort of communicated </v>

15
00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:46.761
<v Speaker 1>and I bought a poster from him because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he made these wooden posters that had </v>

16
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:46.761
<v Speaker 1>neon on them.</v>

17
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:50.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's how we made a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd Kinda trained himself to be a bit </v>

18
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.211
<v Speaker 1>of an electronics guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we made these things and he was </v>

19
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:53.211
<v Speaker 1>trying to quit drinking and we talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

20
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:54.870
<v Speaker 1>He was a lot older than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like 20 years older than me.</v>

21
00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:57.480
<v Speaker 1>I was about 25 at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

22
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.010
<v Speaker 1>we got along pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But every now and then he'd go out and </v>

23
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.850
<v Speaker 1>get a drink and he could really drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>like he was one of these guys who could </v>
<v Speaker 1>drink like 60 beer and you think,</v>

25
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 1>well no one can drink that much and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>

26
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I studied alcohol for like 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of my subjects,</v>

27
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:20.211
<v Speaker 1>father's drank 40 ounces of vodka a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and had been doing it for 20 years so </v>

28
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:21.270
<v Speaker 1>you can drink a lot and he could drink a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

29
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.860
<v Speaker 1>And what would happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to,</v>

30
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:27.861
<v Speaker 1>not drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he'd go out and go on a binge and </v>

31
00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>then he'd be gone for like three days </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he drink up all his money.</v>

32
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.250
<v Speaker 1>And then we'd hear him out in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>backyard howling at the moon with this </v>

33
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.730
<v Speaker 1>little little ugly dog he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 1>and he'd hold him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dog would hell.</v>

35
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:40.480
<v Speaker 1>And he'd haul them and the dog would </v>
<v Speaker 1>haul and,</v>

36
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.770
<v Speaker 1>and it was a rather unsettling and made </v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife nervous and what worse,</v>

37
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.810
<v Speaker 1>you know now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he'd come to the door like </v>

38
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.810
<v Speaker 1>three in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

39
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.190
<v Speaker 1>and he'd knock on the door and he'd be </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing there and I don't know how much</v>

40
00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 1>experience you've had with rough guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are alcoholic and who are drunk,</v>

41
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:07.071
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can be upright and unconscious at </v>

42
00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:13.851
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was the state that he was </v>

43
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:13.851
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:16.660
<v Speaker 1>he'd be just swaying and he'd asked me </v>
<v Speaker 1>if I would like to buy his toaster or </v>

45
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>his microwave because he needed some </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to keep drinking.</v>

46
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:24.621
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really want to buy his toaster </v>

47
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 1>or as microwave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when the x hell's angel,</v>

48
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.850
<v Speaker 1>you all speaking 60 beard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk Quebecois biker shows up at your </v>

49
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.661
<v Speaker 1>door at three in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the offers you to sell offers to </v>

50
00:02:35.661 --> 00:02:39.081
<v Speaker 1>sell you his microwave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The easiest thing is to say I really </v>

51
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:39.630
<v Speaker 1>need a microwave.</v>

52
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

53
00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I bought the microwave and toaster and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some other things.</v>

54
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.690
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then my wife talked to me and she </v>

55
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>liked my landlord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.690
<v Speaker 1>even though she was afraid of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she liked him and she said,</v>

57
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>you can't buy any more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any more appliances because it's not </v>

58
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.930
<v Speaker 1>good for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

59
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting problem.</v>

60
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.790
<v Speaker 1>So what the hell am I going to do about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this because no,</v>

61
00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to buy your microwave just </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to be the right answer at </v>

62
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>three in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

63
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 1>So one time he took me out on his 7:50</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honda and he put me on the back of it.</v>

64
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.910
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to show me his layer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess his hangouts and I got his </v>

65
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.271
<v Speaker 1>wife's helmet on but it didn't fit it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just sit on the top of my head and he </v>

66
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:40.220
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to the bike and he said if the cops</v>

67
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.230
<v Speaker 1>chase us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not stopping.</v>

68
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.550
<v Speaker 1>And then away we went and we went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

69
00:03:46.551 --> 00:03:49.160
<v Speaker 1>like these bars downtown on south of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>

70
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.970
<v Speaker 1>They were very rough places and he got </v>
<v Speaker 1>into like four fights that night because</v>

71
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.470
<v Speaker 1>he was a rough guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

72
00:03:54.471 --> 00:03:59.471
<v Speaker 1>And these kind of punk guys would come </v>
<v Speaker 1>up to them and sort of challenge them </v>

73
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:03.101
<v Speaker 1>and act stupidly around him and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>very skeptical and if you were acting </v>

74
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:03.710
<v Speaker 1>stupidly around him for any length of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

75
00:04:03.711 --> 00:04:06.560
<v Speaker 1>he just hit you because he felt that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you deserved.</v>

76
00:04:06.561 --> 00:04:08.490
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps he was right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.510
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had a firsthand opportunity to </v>

78
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.580
<v Speaker 1>observe him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

79
00:04:13.581 --> 00:04:18.581
<v Speaker 1>he sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a week or two after we had this </v>

80
00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:19.310
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he showed up at the door,</v>

81
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.000
<v Speaker 1>knock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knock,</v>

82
00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:20.810
<v Speaker 1>knock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.180
<v Speaker 1>opened the door and they're standing </v>
<v Speaker 1>there with his eyes half closed and he </v>

84
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.011
<v Speaker 1>was swaying and he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what the appliance was </v>

85
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:33.731
<v Speaker 1>this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted to sell it to me and I </v>

86
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not all I can buy this.</v>

87
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to buy this because I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to quit drinking.</v>

88
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.830
<v Speaker 1>And if I give you this money then you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go and drink it up and it's not</v>

89
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 1>going to be good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what else did I tell him?</v>

90
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I think I told him as well that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing of him coming to my house at</v>

91
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:59.131
<v Speaker 1>like two in the morning was scaring my </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife who we liked and that it had to </v>

92
00:04:59.131 --> 00:04:59.770
<v Speaker 1>stop and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

93
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.010
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about what I was saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was watching me like a rough </v>

94
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 1>guy watches you and a rough guy watches </v>
<v Speaker 1>you like this.</v>

95
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.480
<v Speaker 1>He thinks if you say one thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates contempt,</v>

96
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.610
<v Speaker 1>you're going to bloody well pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was finding my words like,</v>

97
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was crossing a swamp and trying to </v>

98
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.060
<v Speaker 1>look for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the rocks underneath the surface.</v>

99
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>And I said what I had to say very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very carefully.</v>

100
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.340
<v Speaker 1>And he looked at me for about 15 seconds</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a long time to be looked at </v>

101
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.310
<v Speaker 1>at three in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he left and he never came back to </v>

102
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 1>sell me anything again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we got along fine.</v>

103
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.090
<v Speaker 1>But that's a good illustration of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue with regards to truth and success </v>

104
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>in the strange land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I was in the strange land when I</v>

105
00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:59.941
<v Speaker 1>was talking to my neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my landlord Dan and I managed to say </v>

106
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.690
<v Speaker 1>what was true carefully enough so </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that he was a very </v>

107
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.131
<v Speaker 1>violent person and that he was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>intoxicated person and then he had every</v>

108
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:17.441
<v Speaker 1>reason to be suspicious of me and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't communicate very well and I </v>

109
00:06:17.441 --> 00:06:21.641
<v Speaker 1>didn't do what he wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he took it and he left and there </v>

110
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 1>was no problem and life went on just </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine after that,</v>

111
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.800
<v Speaker 1>and so we don't want to underestimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the utility of establishing this bounded</v>

112
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:40.091
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the ideal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to live with some nobility in</v>

113
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 1>truth while aiming at the highest ideal.</v>
