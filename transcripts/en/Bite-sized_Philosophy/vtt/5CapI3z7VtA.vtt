1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.020
<v Speaker 1>So in the second volume of Harry Potter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct me if I have any of these </v>

2
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:06.020
<v Speaker 1>details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rog.</v>

3
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:06.150
<v Speaker 1>You remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that snake,</v>

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.540
<v Speaker 1>the bast lisc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is magic castle,</v>

5
00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys have no problem with that magic</v>

6
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>castle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

7
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.820
<v Speaker 1>There's a north,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's an orphan.</v>

8
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:18.570
<v Speaker 1>He goes to the magic castle to learn how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be more than normal,</v>

9
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The muggles,</v>

10
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.770
<v Speaker 1>he has a muggle family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were not too happy with the muggle </v>

11
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.441
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like as representatives of normal </v>

12
00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:27.441
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

13
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.040
<v Speaker 1>they have some blacks now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

14
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>the reason for that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

15
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:32.730
<v Speaker 1>that's what teenagers often feel about </v>
<v Speaker 1>their parents,</v>

16
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They failed Jesus.</v>

17
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:39.141
<v Speaker 1>These couldn't really be my parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must have some other parents who were </v>

18
00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>like together knows it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like magical parents,</v>

19
00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parents that live in the sky.</v>

20
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>And of course Harry Potter has earthly </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>

21
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the muggles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Dursley I think is the kid.</v>

22
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>He's a one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a wonderful piece of work and uh,</v>

23
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ill formed day,</v>

24
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>spoiled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ill formed,</v>

25
00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:02.250
<v Speaker 1>selfish very far from the ideal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a foil for Harry.</v>

26
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>And of course he's appreciated and doted</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

27
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 1>And Harry is actually punished for his </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtues.</v>

28
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Lots of classic story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

29
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:12.960
<v Speaker 1>To be punished for your virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at the story,</v>

30
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.260
<v Speaker 1>the central story in Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the central story in Christianity is </v>

31
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.161
<v Speaker 1>about someone who is precisely punished </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the worst possible way for the </v>

32
00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:25.611
<v Speaker 1>highest possible virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it makes it an archetypal </v>

33
00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>story because there isn't anything more </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfair than that.</v>

34
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a limit in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be worse than that.</v>

35
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Being punished for being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Speaker 1>unworthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

37
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:33.880
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

38
00:01:33.881 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>I will at least make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to be punished because you have your</v>

39
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 1>act together and you're a good person.</v>

40
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>That's real punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens to Harry.</v>

41
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>So luckily he finds out that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>magical,</v>

42
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.070
<v Speaker 1>which is quite convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And off he goes to wizarding school and </v>

43
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually like taking.</v>

44
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 1>That's actually like going and studying </v>
<v Speaker 1>the humanities.</v>

45
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was when they still were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

46
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>because it's through the humanities that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

47
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.380
<v Speaker 1>that you make contact with the magic of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your culture and that makes you more </v>

48
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:17.511
<v Speaker 1>than merely the child of your parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you are more than merely the </v>

49
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:21.891
<v Speaker 1>child of your parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the child of nature and you're </v>

50
00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:24.741
<v Speaker 1>the child of culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and until you understand what that </v>

51
00:02:24.741 --> 00:02:29.451
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that you have two sets of </v>

52
00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:29.451
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the divine hero always has two sets</v>

53
00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:34.341
<v Speaker 1>of parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't construe yourself properly as </v>

54
00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:39.231
<v Speaker 1>an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not situated properly in the </v>

55
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:41.871
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what your </v>

56
00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:43.431
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't orient your values properly </v>

57
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:46.170
<v Speaker 1>and you will suffer for that because as </v>
<v Speaker 1>far as I can tell,</v>

58
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.010
<v Speaker 1>because life is so difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do something that's truly </v>

59
00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:57.651
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile in order to justify it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so while that's what these stories </v>

60
00:02:59.691 --> 00:03:04.691
<v Speaker 1>tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the story of Jonah is </v>

61
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:06.281
<v Speaker 1>telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have an ethical duty to </v>

62
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:08.750
<v Speaker 1>straighten things up and if you don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

63
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.730
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be story.</v>

64
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.900
<v Speaker 1>And that story is echoed everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now,</v>

65
00:03:14.901 --> 00:03:16.490
<v Speaker 1>St George.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:03:16.491 --> 00:03:18.890
<v Speaker 1>let's go to Harry Potter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we were talking about.</v>

67
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>So he goes off to the magic castle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.510
<v Speaker 1>he's learning to be a wizard and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of an interesting character because</v>

69
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>he's not really good and we find out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I think that's because it doesn't </v>

70
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.920
<v Speaker 1>have a piece of Volta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marty and um,</v>

71
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.740
<v Speaker 1>he's not what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

72
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's what that means is that to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

73
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 1>truly good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of just follow rules that's </v>

74
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>very clear in the Harry Potter story and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also have to be able to understand </v>

75
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.611
<v Speaker 1>malevolence and in order to understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence so that you can withstand </v>

76
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:58.721
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand that part of you </v>

77
00:03:58.721 --> 00:03:59.210
<v Speaker 1>that's malevolent because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're naive.</v>

78
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.880
<v Speaker 1>If you're naive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're easy pickings.</v>

79
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.750
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a union idea too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the union idea is that part of </v>

80
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.801
<v Speaker 1>personality development is to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>your shadow and the shadow is those </v>

81
00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:15.200
<v Speaker 1>things about you that you do not want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>admit to.</v>

82
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.880
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

83
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 1>you can learn about your shadow by </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading history.</v>

84
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can read about Auschwitz,</v>

85
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.410
<v Speaker 1>you can read about the concentration </v>
<v Speaker 1>camps in Russia and you can imagine </v>

86
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.881
<v Speaker 1>yourself as a guard instead of as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroic rescue or unfortunate victims,</v>

87
00:04:36.941 --> 00:04:41.941
<v Speaker 1>which would be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unlikely and once you can imagine </v>

88
00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 1>yourself as a guard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a terrifying thing to do,</v>

89
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 1>then you understand something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

90
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.160
<v Speaker 1>And I actually think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is also from student </v>

91
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.931
<v Speaker 1>studying young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you cannot have proper respect for </v>

92
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:02.581
<v Speaker 1>yourself until you know that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monster because you won't act carefully </v>

93
00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

94
00:05:03.041 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 1>if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

95
00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:05.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm a nice person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never do anyone any harm.</v>

96
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 1>St you can be sure of that and the harm </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you do.</v>

98
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:16.141
<v Speaker 1>People can come in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many ways and so if you regard yourself </v>

99
00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:18.190
<v Speaker 1>as harmless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inoffensive,</v>

100
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.240
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>

101
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.110
<v Speaker 1>Well Marty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have any reason to be careful.</v>

102
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 1>You're like a teddy bear sitting on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shelf.</v>

103
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Even if you throw it at someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's going to get hurt,</v>

104
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.840
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what you're like because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a human being and human beings </v>

105
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.661
<v Speaker 1>are some vicious creatures and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility in knowing that because it's </v>

106
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:40.010
<v Speaker 1>also the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

107
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.280
<v Speaker 1>when the Harry Potter series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry could stand up against voldemort </v>

108
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.941
<v Speaker 1>and understand them and speak his </v>
<v Speaker 1>language because he was infected by him </v>

109
00:05:47.941 --> 00:05:48.460
<v Speaker 1>to some degree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

110
00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:50.380
<v Speaker 1>very interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

111
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.350
<v Speaker 1>in the second 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason I'm telling you this,</v>

112
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.500
<v Speaker 1>and this is where thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like how long were each of those </v>

113
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.621
<v Speaker 1>books?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like 500 pages long and there was how </v>

114
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 1>many of them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven and how many of them were sold.</v>

115
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many of you read every Harry Potter </v>

116
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.280
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

117
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

118
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.500
<v Speaker 1>How many of you read at least one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

119
00:06:17.501 --> 00:06:21.130
<v Speaker 1>How many of you saw the movies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're all in a cult.</v>

120
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.550
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>

121
00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the truth.</v>

122
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:30.430
<v Speaker 1>It's really the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the second volume,</v>

123
00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:31.930
<v Speaker 1>there's this snake that zipping around </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

124
00:06:31.931 --> 00:06:32.860
<v Speaker 1>the Basilisk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

125
00:06:32.861 --> 00:06:36.430
<v Speaker 1>And it lives in the underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos.</v>

126
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.060
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because wherever you are,</v>

127
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.030
<v Speaker 1>you're on thin ice and underneath your </v>
<v Speaker 1>thin ice is chaos.</v>

128
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.240
<v Speaker 1>And here we are in this unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized environment and everyone's </v>

129
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.530
<v Speaker 1>getting along so perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

130
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.780
<v Speaker 1>we've got hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got lights,</v>

131
00:06:52.781 --> 00:06:55.600
<v Speaker 1>we've got electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sewage system is working,</v>

132
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.470
<v Speaker 1>no one's hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like we can be peaceful,</v>

133
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.460
<v Speaker 1>but if any of that fell apart and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could easily fall apart because it's a </v>

134
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.941
<v Speaker 1>bloody miracle it ever works at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the chaos that's just underneath </v>

135
00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:12.250
<v Speaker 1>the surface is going to come up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

136
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.900
<v Speaker 1>And it's useful to know that because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you properly grateful.</v>

137
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.990
<v Speaker 1>If you really understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes you properly grateful for the </v>

138
00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.430
<v Speaker 1>bloody miracle it is that you can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>here in peace.</v>

139
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.790
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this snake that's underneath the</v>

140
00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:32.530
<v Speaker 1>surface and it's no joke that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's big and it's ancient.</v>

141
00:07:32.531 --> 00:07:35.500
<v Speaker 1>It's always been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens if you look at it,</v>

142
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.110
<v Speaker 1>it turns you to stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

143
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:41.550
<v Speaker 1>It paralyzes you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

144
00:07:41.551 --> 00:07:43.200
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the Gorgon,</v>

145
00:07:43.201 --> 00:07:46.770
<v Speaker 1>that's Medusa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The woman with the head of snakes.</v>

146
00:07:46.771 --> 00:07:48.780
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it paralyzes you.</v>

147
00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.850
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

148
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.180
<v Speaker 1>you're walking through the jungle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>big snake appears.</v>

149
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:59.390
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You freeze and no bloody wonder because </v>

150
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:04.070
<v Speaker 1>you're a prey animal and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do when they see things that are </v>

151
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.210
<v Speaker 1>going to eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the snake,</v>

152
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of people still die from snakebite </v>

153
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:15.980
<v Speaker 1>and our ancestors were our ancestors </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

154
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.200
<v Speaker 1>tens of millions of years ago when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were living in trees and weren't very </v>

155
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.531
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made a nice snack for a snake and </v>

156
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:27.411
<v Speaker 1>there's a woman named Lynn Isabelle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's an anthropologist at Ucla who's </v>

157
00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:31.371
<v Speaker 1>correlated the presence of carnivorous </v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes with the acuity of primate </v>

158
00:08:32.191 --> 00:08:37.191
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what she found was that the more </v>

159
00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:37.440
<v Speaker 1>snakes around the better the primates </v>
<v Speaker 1>could see.</v>

160
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:43.790
<v Speaker 1>So and we're particularly good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>picking up patterns like snake </v>

161
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.780
<v Speaker 1>camouflage in the lower half of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual quadrant.</v>

162
00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people generally don't like snakes,</v>

163
00:08:47.881 --> 00:08:50.610
<v Speaker 1>you can learn to handle them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no snake.</v>

164
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Fear appears to be innate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's innate in chimpanzees and it tends </v>

165
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 1>to increase as you age than decreasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can overcome it,</v>

166
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

167
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:01.410
<v Speaker 1>my daughter had snakes and one day her </v>
<v Speaker 1>sneak bitter.</v>

168
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.610
<v Speaker 1>It was a fairly big snake</v>

169
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.860
<v Speaker 1>and she hadn't paid attention to it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>

170
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:11.950
<v Speaker 1>So it nailed her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from then on she had had very </v>

171
00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:16.751
<v Speaker 1>difficult time grabbing the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitten once shy permanently.</v>

172
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:23.950
<v Speaker 1>She also told me years later she had </v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmares about snakes all the time </v>

173
00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.090
<v Speaker 1>when she had a snake in her room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

174
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it was probably the smell.</v>

175
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:33.040
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Harry Potter decides he's going to go</v>

176
00:09:33.441 --> 00:09:38.441
<v Speaker 1>after the basilisk Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to go out there and face the </v>

177
00:09:38.441 --> 00:09:38.780
<v Speaker 1>thing that he's most afraid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he does that.</v>

178
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Weighed out in the depths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like Jonah going down into the </v>

179
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.251
<v Speaker 1>depths and he faces the basilisk and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>bites him and you know,</v>

180
00:09:49.521 --> 00:09:50.660
<v Speaker 1>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

181
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Because if you go down into the depths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get bitten.</v>

182
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Like it's no joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a hero story,</v>

183
00:09:58.071 --> 00:10:00.620
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about the hero stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually real.</v>

184
00:10:00.621 --> 00:10:03.260
<v Speaker 1>The thing that you're facing is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

185
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:08.470
<v Speaker 1>And even though facing it voluntarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be your best bet and is likely </v>

186
00:10:08.601 --> 00:10:13.601
<v Speaker 1>your best bet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the central story of </v>

187
00:10:13.601 --> 00:10:15.611
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean you're going to </v>

188
00:10:15.611 --> 00:10:15.611
<v Speaker 1>succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the real thing.</v>

189
00:10:15.611 --> 00:10:16.160
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets bitten,</v>

190
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's going to die.</v>

191
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Now he's rescuing Jenny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the St George Story.</v>

192
00:10:22.161 --> 00:10:27.050
<v Speaker 1>If you go after like dragon dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to capture virgins,</v>

193
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.280
<v Speaker 1>God only knows why I think it's because</v>

194
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:42.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that male humans have done from the </v>

195
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:45.090
<v Speaker 1>beginning of time is chase the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>predators away.</v>

196
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:51.140
<v Speaker 1>And I suspect that the males from God </v>
<v Speaker 1>only knows how long ago who were </v>

197
00:10:53.011 --> 00:10:58.011
<v Speaker 1>particularly good at that we're rewarded</v>
<v Speaker 1>with female attention.</v>

198
00:10:58.411 --> 00:11:03.411
<v Speaker 1>And why the hell not so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's deeply rooted inside of us.</v>

199
00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:07.320
<v Speaker 1>That idea of facing the unknown and </v>
<v Speaker 1>freeing the woman.</v>

200
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.310
<v Speaker 1>So the idea there is that if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a male idea,</v>

201
00:11:10.311 --> 00:11:15.311
<v Speaker 1>and in large part I can talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>central female myth and I will as we </v>

202
00:11:15.311 --> 00:11:20.271
<v Speaker 1>proceed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that if you're the sort of </v>

203
00:11:20.271 --> 00:11:23.610
<v Speaker 1>person who can stand up against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unknown and the frightening,</v>

204
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.420
<v Speaker 1>then you're also likely if you develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>into that sort of person,</v>

205
00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:32.421
<v Speaker 1>then you're also likely to develop into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of person that other people </v>

206
00:11:32.421 --> 00:11:34.890
<v Speaker 1>will find attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

207
00:11:34.891 --> 00:11:38.520
<v Speaker 1>and that's why young believed that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the shadow was the anima,</v>

208
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.170
<v Speaker 1>which is like a female figure.</v>

209
00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:43.410
<v Speaker 1>And so his idea was something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

210
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.530
<v Speaker 1>if you look watch movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always this Beta male guy,</v>

211
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:52.070
<v Speaker 1>if they're romantic movies and he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice guy and he's the friend and you </v>

212
00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.391
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman tells them everything but she </v>

213
00:11:55.391 --> 00:11:55.930
<v Speaker 1>doesn't like him a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She likes the guy who's like got an edge</v>

214
00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.270
<v Speaker 1>and who's capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say mayhem,</v>

215
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.920
<v Speaker 1>but at least have aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

216
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.810
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean she wants him to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive,</v>

217
00:12:04.811 --> 00:12:08.140
<v Speaker 1>but what it does mean is that she wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>him to be able to be aggressive.</v>

218
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:13.530
<v Speaker 1>That would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's the romantic target and so </v>

219
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:17.011
<v Speaker 1>he's the person that's incorporating the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow and he's someone that is </v>

220
00:12:17.011 --> 00:12:19.870
<v Speaker 1>respectable and perhaps useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

221
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very old story,</v>

222
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.050
<v Speaker 1>so let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's think about this for a minute.</v>

223
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:43.410
<v Speaker 1>I've already offered you a proposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's an important </v>

224
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:48.001
<v Speaker 1>proposition and I'm offering you this </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition so that you can make sense </v>

225
00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:53.131
<v Speaker 1>of art and literature and mythology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion and dance and all those strange</v>

226
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 1>ritualistic things that human beings do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which seems central to us,</v>

227
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:04.021
<v Speaker 1>including including not least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ineradicable tendency of us to seek </v>

228
00:13:07.091 --> 00:13:12.091
<v Speaker 1>out stories of heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should finish the Harry Potter story.</v>

229
00:13:13.811 --> 00:13:18.040
<v Speaker 1>So Harry Potter goes down there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rescue Virginia.</v>

230
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:18.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

231
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.430
<v Speaker 1>that's not her name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it,</v>

232
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Jenny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

233
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.540
<v Speaker 1>but there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a formal name for that.</v>

234
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a variant of Virginia anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very divergent.</v>

235
00:13:29.201 --> 00:13:30.610
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

236
00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.270
<v Speaker 1>and he gets bitten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jen.</v>

237
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.090
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ginevra.</v>

238
00:13:34.091 --> 00:13:37.420
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets bitten and the bite is poisonous</v>

239
00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.980
<v Speaker 1>and so there is dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't seem to be so good.</v>

240
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:43.630
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens?</v>

241
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.130
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys swallowed this.</v>

242
00:13:45.131 --> 00:13:48.250
<v Speaker 1>It's no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's his name?</v>

243
00:13:48.251 --> 00:13:51.160
<v Speaker 1>The dumbledore character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a bird,</v>

244
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's the wise old man.</v>

245
00:13:53.831 --> 00:13:57.220
<v Speaker 1>He's the ruler of the castle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the ruler of the magic castle.</v>

246
00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.980
<v Speaker 1>He's the magic king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

247
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.190
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God the father as far as Harry Potter is</v>

248
00:14:03.191 --> 00:14:04.810
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he has a bird.</v>

249
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.750
<v Speaker 1>What kind of bird is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a phoenix.</v>

250
00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:12.751
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's very </v>

251
00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:14.290
<v Speaker 1>strange about a phoenix is that while </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a mortal but in a strange way,</v>

252
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it lives and lives,</v>

253
00:14:16.181 --> 00:14:19.270
<v Speaker 1>I think 100 years and it gets older and </v>
<v Speaker 1>older and then one day poof,</v>

254
00:14:19.271 --> 00:14:24.160
<v Speaker 1>it burst into flames and turns into an </v>
<v Speaker 1>egg and then you get a new phoenix.</v>

255
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.440
<v Speaker 1>So that's a symbol of transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a symbol of transformation.</v>

256
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.620
<v Speaker 1>The bird is a spirit or psyche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so here's what it means in part,</v>

257
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:40.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how when you learn a lesson in </v>

258
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:42.430
<v Speaker 1>your life that that's not very pleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

259
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.890
<v Speaker 1>It's not like when you learn something </v>
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

260
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.640
<v Speaker 1>it's the best day of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's often the importance of what you </v>

261
00:14:51.111 --> 00:14:54.830
<v Speaker 1>learn is often proportionate to just how</v>
<v Speaker 1>ratcheted it is to learn it.</v>

262
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn things the hard way.</v>

263
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:02.110
<v Speaker 1>You learn things by getting hit because </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously if what you're doing is </v>

264
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.500
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get what you want.</v>

265
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.020
<v Speaker 1>There's no learning in that and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>

266
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:11.230
<v Speaker 1>It's when you're doing something and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit an obstacle and maybe a bloody well </v>

267
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.840
<v Speaker 1>hit it hard and then you know you recoil</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you down into the depths you go</v>

268
00:15:14.841 --> 00:15:17.440
<v Speaker 1>and you have to sort yourself out and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized that you're,</v>

269
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:22.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this particular kind of idiot and that </v>

270
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.000
<v Speaker 1>you should probably fix that and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really annoying and difficult and you </v>

271
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.721
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you're down in the dumps and </v>

272
00:15:28.721 --> 00:15:31.061
<v Speaker 1>anxious for quite a while and then you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it repaired more or less than you </v>

273
00:15:31.061 --> 00:15:31.061
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put yourself back together.</v>

274
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:36.250
<v Speaker 1>That's the Phoenix poof into flames.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang Egg knew you.</v>

275
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.450
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the ability to learn.</v>

276
00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are very strange creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

277
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.950
<v Speaker 1>Because we're very malleable compared to</v>
<v Speaker 1>most animals,</v>

278
00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 1>like grizzly bears now in grizzly bears </v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand years ago.</v>

279
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:55.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are the same thing.</v>

280
00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:00.760
<v Speaker 1>They do the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no transformation about human </v>

281
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.920
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have this massive brain and you know,</v>

282
00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:08.921
<v Speaker 1>it's a pain because it means you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of human children until </v>

283
00:16:08.921 --> 00:16:12.701
<v Speaker 1>they're 40 and that's a big burden and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

284
00:16:13.191 --> 00:16:14.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we pay a big price for it.</v>

285
00:16:14.571 --> 00:16:17.540
<v Speaker 1>It also makes childbirth very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

286
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:20.360
<v Speaker 1>and it's costly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to eat a lot because you have a</v>

287
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:23.270
<v Speaker 1>big brain because it uses up a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy and so,</v>

288
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:25.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pay a price for it,</v>

289
00:16:25.731 --> 00:16:29.030
<v Speaker 1>but the advantages your plastic you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>

290
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Now learning is a strange thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of it as just acquiring </v>

291
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:40.511
<v Speaker 1>more information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could also think of it and this </v>

292
00:16:40.511 --> 00:16:44.621
<v Speaker 1>is more accurate as finding out </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you're doing wrong.</v>

293
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.150
<v Speaker 1>So that sort of built into you like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>

294
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.820
<v Speaker 1>a character element of your character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of presumption,</v>

295
00:16:49.821 --> 00:16:53.150
<v Speaker 1>of your perception or a deep habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really built into you.</v>

296
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:54.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a neural structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

297
00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:00.490
<v Speaker 1>It's little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's alive and you have to kill it </v>

298
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.110
<v Speaker 1>because he's working properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the pain that you go through in part</v>

299
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.300
<v Speaker 1>when you're suffering because you did </v>
<v Speaker 1>something stupid.</v>

300
00:17:05.301 --> 00:17:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Is it something like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

301
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.650
<v Speaker 1>the neurology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can never get this quite right.</v>

302
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.400
<v Speaker 1>It's the pain of the death of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and that can be a huge chunk </v>

303
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.010
<v Speaker 1>of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

304
00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:24.011
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really have to go through a </v>

305
00:17:24.011 --> 00:17:26.140
<v Speaker 1>massive revision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the person that comes out the </v>

306
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.560
<v Speaker 1>other end might hardly be the same at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

307
00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.060
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens.</v>

308
00:17:29.061 --> 00:17:31.850
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to combat alcoholism,</v>

309
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:33.770
<v Speaker 1>which is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

310
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.950
<v Speaker 1>a wretched thing to do because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

311
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.670
<v Speaker 1>all your friends are alcoholic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All your family drinks too much.</v>

312
00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:45.820
<v Speaker 1>The only thing you know how to do when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're socializing is to go to the bar </v>

313
00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.121
<v Speaker 1>and drink too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you spend like 20 hours a </v>

314
00:17:49.121 --> 00:17:52.631
<v Speaker 1>week on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's not just that you're </v>

315
00:17:52.631 --> 00:17:54.540
<v Speaker 1>addicted to the substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's how you live.</v>

316
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:56.760
<v Speaker 1>And so if you want to stop being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic,</v>

317
00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.460
<v Speaker 1>not only do you have to stop drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol,</v>

318
00:17:59.461 --> 00:18:04.461
<v Speaker 1>but you have to stop seeing all your </v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk friends and then maybe you've had </v>

319
00:18:04.461 --> 00:18:08.751
<v Speaker 1>them for your whole life and you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have continual battles with your drunk </v>

320
00:18:08.751 --> 00:18:12.441
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to figure out </v>

321
00:18:12.441 --> 00:18:14.331
<v Speaker 1>something to do with that 20 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's now like hanging around your neck </v>

322
00:18:14.331 --> 00:18:18.441
<v Speaker 1>like an Albatross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you have to let that whole part </v>

323
00:18:18.441 --> 00:18:22.320
<v Speaker 1>of your personality die and a new part </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to spring forth.</v>

324
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:28.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the Phoenix is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Phoenix is the capacity of the </v>

325
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:31.641
<v Speaker 1>person to transform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when Harry gets bit by the snake </v>

326
00:18:32.851 --> 00:18:36.840
<v Speaker 1>that freezes him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets seriously injured.</v>

327
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:39.510
<v Speaker 1>The Phoenix comes in Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some tears in his wound,</v>

328
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:43.340
<v Speaker 2>it prepares him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>

329
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.400
<v Speaker 2>He's back to life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

330
00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:52.020
<v Speaker 1>the strange thing is that that's okay </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all of the viewers.</v>

331
00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Now why would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing about it that's </v>

332
00:18:58.050 --> 00:18:58.050
<v Speaker 1>rational.</v>

333
00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.650
<v Speaker 2>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

334
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Magic Castle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not rational.</v>

335
00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Giant snake underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a little more rational turning </v>

336
00:19:10.151 --> 00:19:12.700
<v Speaker 1>you to stone going down there to face </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

337
00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.890
<v Speaker 1>being rejuvenated by a phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

338
00:19:14.891 --> 00:19:15.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

339
00:19:15.221 --> 00:19:16.000
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can.</v>

340
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:21.630
<v Speaker 1>We'll watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll swallow it will be completely </v>

341
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:24.721
<v Speaker 1>engaged in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because it's </v>

342
00:19:24.721 --> 00:19:24.730
<v Speaker 1>a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about how people.</v>

343
00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a Meta story about how to act about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to conduct yourself.</v>

344
