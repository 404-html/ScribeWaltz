1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Do you know if you take people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've told you this and you expose </v>

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.100
<v Speaker 1>them voluntarily to things that they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoiding and are afraid of,</v>

3
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they know they need to overcome in </v>

4
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:12.130
<v Speaker 1>order to meet their goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their self defined goals.</v>

5
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.790
<v Speaker 1>If you can teach people to stand up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the face of the things they're afraid </v>

6
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.241
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get stronger and you don't know </v>

7
00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:23.211
<v Speaker 1>what the upper limits to that art </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you might ask yourself like if </v>

8
00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:26.481
<v Speaker 1>for 10 years if you didn't avoid doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you knew you needed to do by the </v>

9
00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>depth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by your own definitions,</v>

10
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:32.691
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Within the value structure that you've </v>

11
00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:32.691
<v Speaker 1>created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that you've done that,</v>

12
00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>what would you be like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are remarkable people who come </v>

14
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.411
<v Speaker 1>into the world from time to time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people who do find out over </v>

15
00:00:42.411 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>decades long periods what they could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like if they were who they were.</v>

16
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.690
<v Speaker 1>If they said if they spoke their being </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward and they get stronger and </v>

17
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:54.210
<v Speaker 1>stronger and stronger and we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>the limits to that.</v>

18
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>We do not know the limits to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you could say,</v>

19
00:00:56.701 --> 00:01:01.701
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in part perhaps the reason that you're </v>

20
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:03.441
<v Speaker 1>suffering unbearably can be left at your</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet because you're not everything you </v>

21
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>could be and you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's a terrible thing to</v>

22
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.490
<v Speaker 1>admit and it's a terrible thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider,</v>

23
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>but there's real promise in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:15.681
<v Speaker 1>Because it means that perhaps there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>another way that you could look at the </v>

25
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>world and the number another way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could act in the world.</v>

26
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:23.391
<v Speaker 1>So what it would reflect back to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be much better than what it </v>

27
00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:24.600
<v Speaker 1>reflects back to you now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the second part of that is,</v>

28
00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:29.601
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that many people did that </v>

29
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:29.601
<v Speaker 1>because we've done a lot as human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

30
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>We've done a lot of remarkable things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've told you already,</v>

31
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 1>I think before that today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

32
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.590
<v Speaker 1>about 250,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will be lifted out of abject </v>

33
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And about 300,000</v>

34
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:42.750
<v Speaker 1>people attached to the electrical power </v>
<v Speaker 1>grid we're making.</v>

35
00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:47.751
<v Speaker 1>People were lifting people out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty collectively at a faster rate </v>

36
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 1>that's ever occurred in the history of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humankind by a huge margin.</v>

37
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's been going on unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly since the year 2000.</v>

38
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.120
<v Speaker 1>The UN had planned to have poverty </v>
<v Speaker 1>between 2000 and 2015 and it was </v>

39
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 1>accomplished by 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's inequality developing in many</v>

40
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>places and you hear lots of political </v>
<v Speaker 1>agitation about that.</v>

41
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.900
<v Speaker 1>But overall the tide is lifting everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and now it's a great thing and we </v>

42
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.461
<v Speaker 1>have no idea how fast we can multiply </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if people got their act together </v>

43
00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>and really aimed at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>

44
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.500
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my experience is with people that were </v>

45
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>probably running at about 51 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our capacity.</v>

46
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Something mean you can think about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourselves.</v>

47
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.190
<v Speaker 1>I often ask undergraduates how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours a day you waste or how many hours </v>

48
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.051
<v Speaker 1>a week you waste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The classic answer is something like </v>

49
00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:36.120
<v Speaker 1>four to six hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

50
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 1>inefficient studying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching things on youtube that not only</v>

51
00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:42.870
<v Speaker 1>do you not want to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't even care about that make</v>

52
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:45.300
<v Speaker 1>you feel horrible about watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After you're done,</v>

53
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>that's probably four hours right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you think,</v>

54
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>well that's 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 hours a week.</v>

55
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 hours a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's two and a half full work weeks.</v>

56
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.480
<v Speaker 1>It's half a year of work weeks per year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if your time is worth $20 an hour,</v>

57
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>which is a radical underestimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably more like 50.</v>

58
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>deferred wages,</v>

59
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>if you're wasting 20 hours a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wasting $50,000</v>

60
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:14.851
<v Speaker 1>a year and you are doing that right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's because you're young wasting </v>

61
00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:19.201
<v Speaker 1>$50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year as a way bigger catastrophe than </v>

62
00:03:19.201 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>it would be for me to waste it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to last nearly as long and</v>

63
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 1>so if your life isn't everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be.</v>

64
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>You could ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

65
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.410
<v Speaker 1>what would happen if you just stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasting the opportunities that are in </v>

66
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.101
<v Speaker 1>front of you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You be who knows how much more </v>

67
00:03:32.101 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 times more efficient,</v>

68
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 1>20 times more efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the prieto distribution.</v>

69
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea how efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient people get.</v>

70
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>It's completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's off the charts</v>

71
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.520
<v Speaker 1>well and if we all got our act together </v>
<v Speaker 1>collectively and stopped making things </v>

72
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.390
<v Speaker 1>worse because that's another thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do all the time.</v>

73
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.570
<v Speaker 1>Not only do they not do what they should</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make things better,</v>

74
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.690
<v Speaker 1>they actively attempt to make things </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse because they're spiteful or </v>

75
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.961
<v Speaker 1>resentful or arrogant or deceitful or or</v>
<v Speaker 1>homicidal or genocidal or all of those </v>

76
00:04:04.501 --> 00:04:09.180
<v Speaker 1>things all bundled together in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely pathological package.</v>

77
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.380
<v Speaker 1>If people stopped really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really trying just to make things worse,</v>

78
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.470
<v Speaker 1>we have no idea how much better they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would get just because of that.</v>

79
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.280
<v Speaker 1>So there's this weird dynamic that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the existential system of ideas </v>

80
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.630
<v Speaker 1>between human vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social judgment,</v>

81
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.910
<v Speaker 1>both of which are are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

82
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.120
<v Speaker 1>are major causes of suffering and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure of individuals to adopt the </v>

83
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.200
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that they know they </v>
<v Speaker 1>should adopt.</v>

84
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing that's interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

85
00:04:36.181 --> 00:04:41.181
<v Speaker 1>is that like one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another thing I've asked often asked my </v>

86
00:04:41.181 --> 00:04:42.510
<v Speaker 1>undergraduate classes is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.540
<v Speaker 1>there's this idea that people have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have a conscience and you know </v>

88
00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:48.780
<v Speaker 1>what the conscience is.</v>

89
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.780
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this feeling or voice you have in </v>

90
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.530
<v Speaker 1>your head just before you do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know is stupid,</v>

91
00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:59.040
<v Speaker 1>telling you that probably you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that stupid thing.</v>

92
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.830
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to listen to it strangely</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

93
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.310
<v Speaker 1>But you go ahead and do it anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course exactly what the </v>

94
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.420
<v Speaker 1>conscience told you was going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitably happens so that you feel even</v>

95
00:05:09.421 --> 00:05:12.150
<v Speaker 1>stupider about it than you would if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened by accident.</v>

96
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.970
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew this was going to happen.</v>

97
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.150
<v Speaker 1>I got a warning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was gonna happen and I went and did </v>

98
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.911
<v Speaker 1>it anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the funny thing too is that that </v>

99
00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:25.131
<v Speaker 1>conscience operates within people and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>really don't understand what the hell </v>

100
00:05:25.131 --> 00:05:25.131
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>

101
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:26.500
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

102
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:31.501
<v Speaker 1>what would happen if you abided by your </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience for five years or for 10 </v>

103
00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sort of position might you be in?</v>

104
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:37.411
<v Speaker 1>What sort of family might you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What sort of relationship might you be </v>

105
00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:40.801
<v Speaker 1>able to forge?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can be bloody sure that a </v>

106
00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:43.471
<v Speaker 1>relationship that's forged on the basis </v>
<v Speaker 1>of who you actually are is going to be a</v>

107
00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:48.721
<v Speaker 1>lot stronger and more welcome than one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's forged on the basis of who you </v>

108
00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:48.850
<v Speaker 1>aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

109
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:53.851
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that the person you're with </v>

110
00:05:53.851 --> 00:05:55.621
<v Speaker 1>has to deal with the full force of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>in all your ability and your </v>

111
00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:56.830
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very,</v>

112
00:05:56.831 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 1>very thing to negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you do negotiate it well,</v>

113
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:05.861
<v Speaker 1>at least you have something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have somewhere solid to stand and </v>

114
00:06:05.861 --> 00:06:09.671
<v Speaker 1>you have somewhere to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a real life and it's a great </v>

115
00:06:09.671 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 1>basis upon which to bring children into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

116
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:16.121
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can have an actual </v>

117
00:06:16.121 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 1>relationship with them instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>torturing them half to death,</v>

118
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:21.311
<v Speaker 1>which is what happens in a tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tremendously large minority of cases.</v>

119
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more than that too because,</v>

120
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I'll close with and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why I wanted to introduce social</v>

121
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:29.930
<v Speaker 1>units since readings to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

122
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:35.230
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't merely that your fate </v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on whether or not you get your </v>

123
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.091
<v Speaker 1>act together and to what degree you </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide that you're going to live out </v>

124
00:06:40.091 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 1>your own genuine being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't only your fate,</v>

125
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.170
<v Speaker 1>it's the fate of everyone that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>networked with.</v>

126
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.700
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

127
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:49.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 9 billion,</v>

128
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:54.070
<v Speaker 1>7 billion people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to peak at about $9 billion </v>

129
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it'll decline rapidly,</v>

130
00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 1>but 7 billion people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who are you?</v>

131
00:06:57.051 --> 00:07:00.290
<v Speaker 1>You're just one little dust mote among </v>
<v Speaker 1>that 7 billion,</v>

132
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 1>and so it really doesn't matter what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do or don't do,</v>

133
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:07.541
<v Speaker 1>but that's simply not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the wrong model because you're at </v>

134
00:07:07.541 --> 00:07:10.280
<v Speaker 1>the center of a network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a node in a network.</v>

135
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Of course that's even more true now that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have social media.</v>

136
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.190
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll know a thousand people at least </v>

137
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.831
<v Speaker 1>over the course of your life and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>know a thousand people each and that </v>

138
00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 1>puts you one person away from a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>and two persons away from a billion.</v>

139
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.840
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how you're connected and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things you do.</v>

140
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 1>They're like dropping a stone in a pond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ripples move outward and they effect</v>

141
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 1>things in ways that you can't fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehend.</v>

142
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:39.371
<v Speaker 1>And it means that the things that you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you don't do are far more </v>

143
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:39.680
<v Speaker 1>important than you think.</v>

144
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.840
<v Speaker 1>And so if you act that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

145
00:07:42.841 --> 00:07:46.830
<v Speaker 1>the terror of realizing that is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually starts to matter what you do.</v>

146
00:07:46.831 --> 00:07:51.831
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's better than living a </v>

147
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:51.840
<v Speaker 1>meaningless existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better for it to matter.</v>

148
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.940
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really asked yourself,</v>

149
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.040
<v Speaker 1>would you be so sure if you had the </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>

150
00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I can live with no responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

151
00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:04.070
<v Speaker 1>The price I pay is that nothing matters </v>
<v Speaker 1>or I can reverse it and everything </v>

152
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.721
<v Speaker 1>matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to take the responsibility </v>

153
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:11.691
<v Speaker 1>that's associated with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so obvious to me that people </v>

154
00:08:11.691 --> 00:08:11.691
<v Speaker 1>would take the meaningful path.</v>

155
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.280
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say,</v>

156
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:18.281
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilists suffer dreadfully because </v>

157
00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:18.281
<v Speaker 1>there's no meaning in their life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they still suffer.</v>

158
00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:18.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the advantages,</v>

159
00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:21.340
<v Speaker 1>they have no responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the payoff.</v>

160
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.090
<v Speaker 1>And I actually think that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>

161
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

162
00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:26.390
<v Speaker 1>I can't help being nihilistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my belief systems have collapsed.</v>

163
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:27.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

164
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:32.171
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've just allowed them to </v>

165
00:08:32.171 --> 00:08:34.631
<v Speaker 1>collapse because it's a hell of a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier than acting them out and the </v>

166
00:08:34.631 --> 00:08:34.631
<v Speaker 1>price you pay is a meaningless </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

167
00:08:34.631 --> 00:08:39.371
<v Speaker 1>but you can always whine about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people will feel sorry for you and you </v>

168
00:08:39.371 --> 00:08:39.560
<v Speaker 1>have the option of taking the pathway of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the martyr.</v>

169
00:08:39.561 --> 00:08:41.840
<v Speaker 1>So that's a pretty good deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All things considered,</v>

170
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:47.080
<v Speaker 1>especially when the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the alternative is to bear your </v>

171
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.060
<v Speaker 1>burdens properly into live forthrightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world,</v>

172
00:08:50.061 --> 00:08:52.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Solzhenitsyn figured out in so many</v>

173
00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:54.800
<v Speaker 1>people in the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just him,</v>

174
00:08:54.801 --> 00:08:59.760
<v Speaker 1>even though he's the best example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you live a pathological life,</v>

175
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.900
<v Speaker 1>you pathologize your society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if enough people do that,</v>

176
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:08.520
<v Speaker 1>then it's held really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

177
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.860
<v Speaker 1>and you can read the Gulag archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have the fortitude to do that and</v>

178
00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:18.861
<v Speaker 1>you'll see exactly what hell is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can decide if that's a </v>

179
00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:20.100
<v Speaker 1>place you'd like to visit or even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>importantly,</v>

180
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:25.101
<v Speaker 1>if it's a light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's a place you'd like to visit and </v>

181
00:09:25.101 --> 00:09:27.801
<v Speaker 1>take all your family and friends because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened in the 20th </v>

182
00:09:27.801 --> 00:09:27.801
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
