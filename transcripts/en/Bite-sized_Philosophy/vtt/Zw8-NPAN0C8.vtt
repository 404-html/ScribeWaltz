00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.290
<v Speaker 1>What happens with the postmodernist as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of </v>

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>interpretations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the human part of them goes,</v>

4
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.450
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what am I supposed to do next?</v>

5
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Then since there's an infinite number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>choices and the postmodernist says,</v>

6
00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:16.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my theory can't account for that,</v>

7
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.260
<v Speaker 1>and then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

8
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.290
<v Speaker 1>back to Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's why I think there's this </v>

9
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.961
<v Speaker 1>unholy alliance between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists and the Neo Marxists </v>

10
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:28.150
<v Speaker 1>because postmodernism is a is a dead end</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the perspective of applicable </v>

11
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.641
<v Speaker 1>wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It leaves you bereft and nihilistic and </v>

12
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:36.181
<v Speaker 1>that's not good because people can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist without a purpose and so they </v>

13
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:39.571
<v Speaker 1>sneak the Marxism through the back door </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and jump into this power landscape </v>

14
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:41.080
<v Speaker 1>for the reasons that we discussed </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>

15
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.100
<v Speaker 1>So I really think that it's because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>an infinite number of possibilities </v>

16
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.041
<v Speaker 1>interpretating things because I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>always felt that it was really just a </v>

17
00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:49.041
<v Speaker 1>response to capitalism.</v>

18
00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:52.940
<v Speaker 1>The capitalism is a very negative aspect</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our culture and society and that </v>

19
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative.</v>

20
00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Marxism is a clearly defined alternative</v>
<v Speaker 1>that other people have subscribed to in </v>

21
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could point to it,</v>

22
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.850
<v Speaker 1>it's a structure that's already are </v>
<v Speaker 1>already set up and it's romanticized and</v>

23
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:10.851
<v Speaker 1>I think they adopted for that reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it has a socialist aspects </v>

24
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>attached to it and they looked at </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialism as some sort of a thing that a</v>

25
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.760
<v Speaker 1>regards equality and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>some sort of an egalitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

27
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'd have to take two things apart.</v>

28
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:25.080
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to take Marxism slash neo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxist,</v>

29
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Marxism and postmodernism apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we could do that historically.</v>

30
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that although there is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason for postmodernism,</v>

31
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>which is the reason we just discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the landscape,</v>

32
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>the infinite landscape of interpretation</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

33
00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>it's a real problem.</v>

34
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>If you look at it historically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism actually grew out of </v>

35
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what,</v>

36
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened is that the Marxists laid </v>

37
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 1>out their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

38
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.640
<v Speaker 1>their theory about the human social </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment being composed of a power </v>

39
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:58.560
<v Speaker 1>struggle between the privileged and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>underprivileged,</v>

40
00:01:58.561 --> 00:01:59.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rich and the poor.</v>

41
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>And in its initial phases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a story that's partially true</v>

42
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.290
<v Speaker 1>and it's got a lot of motive power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the motive power is the romantic </v>

43
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.311
<v Speaker 1>motive power that you just described.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to be on this side of the </v>

44
00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:13.311
<v Speaker 1>oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to be a war.</v>

45
00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>You're for what's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the resentment element,</v>

46
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>which is that son of a bitch has more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than me,</v>

47
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:22.161
<v Speaker 1>so let's cut them off at the knees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which manifested itself brutally in the </v>

48
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union and then there's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological totality issue which gives </v>

49
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.781
<v Speaker 1>people a sense of security that took a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vicious hit by by the late 19 sixties </v>

50
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:34.611
<v Speaker 1>because the murderousness of Marxism had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been clearly laid out as a doctrine and </v>

51
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:38.511
<v Speaker 1>that opened the door to this move by by </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly French intellectuals to to </v>

52
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.620
<v Speaker 1>develop the postmodern philosophy which </v>
<v Speaker 1>has these advantages which we described,</v>

53
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.050
<v Speaker 1>but also to use that as a screening </v>
<v Speaker 1>tactic for allowing Marxism to transform</v>

54
00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>into identity politics and so like.</v>

55
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.870
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to disentangle all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations that are going on in there,</v>

56
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:59.871
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about it that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's truly intellectually </v>

57
00:02:59.871 --> 00:03:03.351
<v Speaker 1>pathological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't get to be a </v>

58
00:03:03.351 --> 00:03:05.881
<v Speaker 1>postmodernist and a Marxist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You actually technically cannot be both </v>

59
00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:10.291
<v Speaker 1>of those things at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that most people are both </v>

60
00:03:10.291 --> 00:03:13.981
<v Speaker 1>of those things at the same time raises </v>
<v Speaker 1>the specter of just exactly what their </v>

61
00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:19.021
<v Speaker 1>motivation is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would say it's this </v>

62
00:03:19.021 --> 00:03:21.361
<v Speaker 1>resentment driven anti capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's reasons to criticize </v>

63
00:03:21.361 --> 00:03:25.801
<v Speaker 1>capitalism obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's this underground resentment </v>

64
00:03:25.801 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>driven anti-capitalism that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the fundamental motivators.</v>
