1
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.630
<v Speaker 1>That's why a dragon hordes gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>what's up with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:05.061 --> 00:00:09.290
<v Speaker 1>it'll eat you and it will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has gold.</v>

4
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do about that?</v>

5
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

6
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.170
<v Speaker 1>it's paradoxical demands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:18.220
<v Speaker 1>what you want to do is face the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get the damn gold.</v>

8
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.450
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.660
<v Speaker 1>you have to be a paradoxical being even </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

10
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:25.510
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Hobbit,</v>

12
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

13
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>what's his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frodo,</v>

14
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't,</v>

15
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.190
<v Speaker 1>it's not Bilbo Bilbo in the Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>he's kind of this little underdeveloped</v>

17
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.240
<v Speaker 1>overprotected shire dweller and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>called on a great adventure to go and </v>

18
00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:49.931
<v Speaker 1>find the dragon and he has to become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thief in order to manage it.</v>

19
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty weird,</v>

20
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:53.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

21
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because as a good citizen,</v>

22
00:00:57.051 --> 00:00:59.630
<v Speaker 1>he's just not enough to conquer a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon.</v>

23
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.930
<v Speaker 1>He asked to also become a bad citizen in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>

24
00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:06.320
<v Speaker 1>He has to incorporate the part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves that's monstrous,</v>

25
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.050
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and develop that and hone it.</v>

26
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.360
<v Speaker 1>And that's to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

27
00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:13.460
<v Speaker 1>if you're harmless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not virtuous,</v>

28
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.120
<v Speaker 1>you're just harmless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like a rabbit.</v>

29
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Rabbit isn't virtuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just just can't do anything except </v>

30
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.530
<v Speaker 1>get eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not virtuous.</v>

31
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.880
<v Speaker 1>If you're a monster and you don't act </v>
<v Speaker 1>monstrously,</v>

32
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.450
<v Speaker 1>then you're virtuous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also have to be a monster while </v>

33
00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.670
<v Speaker 1>you see this all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harry Potter's like that too.</v>

34
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's flawed,</v>

35
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:37.760
<v Speaker 1>he's hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got evil in him.</v>

36
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:39.140
<v Speaker 1>He can talk to snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

37
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.470
<v Speaker 1>He breaks rules all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

38
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>He's not an obedient at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

39
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.140
<v Speaker 1>he has a good reason for breaking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules and if he couldn't break the </v>

40
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.801
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and his little clique of rule </v>

41
00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 1>breaking troublemakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they didn't break the rules,</v>

42
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.030
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't attain the highest goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very peculiar,</v>

43
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:00.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very.</v>

44
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:01.070
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

45
00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:04.190
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common mythological notion.</v>

46
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero has to be,</v>

47
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.220
<v Speaker 1>the hero has to be a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a controlled monster.</v>

48
00:02:12.221 --> 00:02:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Batman is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

49
00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:14.650
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's everywhere.</v>

50
00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:19.651
<v Speaker 1>It's the tour story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always hear meaning.</v>

51
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.010
<v Speaker 1>We have to be more precise.</v>

52
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

53
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.470
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question because one </v>
<v Speaker 1>question is,</v>

54
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of implicitly moral insofar </v>

55
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.110
<v Speaker 1>as you're socialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's sort of procedural.</v>

56
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:41.150
<v Speaker 1>It's just built into you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is different.</v>

57
00:02:41.151 --> 00:02:46.151
<v Speaker 1>This is also becoming conscious of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and expanding out your personality into </v>

58
00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:47.390
<v Speaker 1>dimensions that it wouldn't normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupy.</v>

59
00:02:47.391 --> 00:02:49.820
<v Speaker 1>So did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This happens to people all the time.</v>

60
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.940
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of my clients,</v>

61
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:57.941
<v Speaker 1>my clinical clients are too agreeable </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're generally women because </v>

62
00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:02.351
<v Speaker 1>women are more agreeable than men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but always because I've had agreeable </v>

63
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:05.731
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his clients as well and what happens is </v>

64
00:03:05.731 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're resentful and they don't know </v>

65
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.171
<v Speaker 1>how to stand up for themselves and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're very compassionate by </v>

66
00:03:10.171 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 1>nature and so if you're entering into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiation with them,</v>

67
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 1>they'll let you win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

68
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>that's not so good because you know you </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to win too.</v>

69
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're in an organization </v>
<v Speaker 1>of adults where there's.</v>

70
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>There's a struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

71
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>When you have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can let them win.</v>

72
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Especially infants you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to let them win and that's </v>

73
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>partly why compassion is so necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a,</v>

74
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 1>as a basis for negotiation between </v>
<v Speaker 1>adults,</v>

75
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

76
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>it's insufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>

77
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a bit of a monster so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can say no and so a lot of what</v>

78
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>you do in psychotherapy is treat </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's anxiety and depression.</v>

79
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:53.221
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge chunk of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Help them straighten out the way they </v>

80
00:03:53.221 --> 00:03:53.221
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge chunk of it,</v>

81
00:03:53.221 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>but another chunk of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

82
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:55.960
<v Speaker 1>let's toughen you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

83
00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>let's put you in a position where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can bargain.</v>

84
00:03:57.881 --> 00:04:02.881
<v Speaker 1>Let's teach you how to assert yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stand up for yourself and that's </v>

85
00:04:02.881 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 1>assertiveness training and it's a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>chunk of psychotherapy and you need to.</v>

86
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.770
<v Speaker 1>You need to learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like because part of how you </v>

87
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.451
<v Speaker 1>regulate your interactions with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people is to negotiate and you cannot </v>

88
00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:18.490
<v Speaker 1>negotiate unless you can say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do it,</v>

89
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.090
<v Speaker 1>and its causes conflict to say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't like conflict,</v>

90
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being agreeable,</v>

91
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.580
<v Speaker 1>then you can't tolerate the conflict and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you can't negotiate on your own </v>

92
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.061
<v Speaker 1>behalf and so then you keep losing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're bullied and you know it's not </v>

93
00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:34.270
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you get resentful and,</v>

94
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.300
<v Speaker 1>and it's really not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to develop your inner </v>

95
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.390
<v Speaker 1>monster a little bit and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that makes you a better person,</v>

96
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 1>not a worst person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

97
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.950
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

98
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>but that's just how it is.</v>
