00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Iq is a very good predictor of health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a predictor of longevity.</v>

2
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a predictor of resistance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>posttraumatic stress disorder.</v>

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a predictor of obviously </v>
<v Speaker 1>occupational status.</v>

4
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a predictor of educational success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a predictor of income.</v>

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.860
<v Speaker 1>It's very powerful predictive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's another way of </v>

6
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.170
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizing its effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine that you could choose how you</v>

7
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:32.541
<v Speaker 1>were going to be when you were born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is in North America because </v>

8
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:33.510
<v Speaker 1>it's going to vary by society at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>to some degree.</v>

9
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>You get to be born into a family that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the 95th percentile for wealth or you</v>

10
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:44.661
<v Speaker 1>get to be born at the 95th percentile </v>
<v Speaker 1>for intelligence who's better off at the</v>

11
00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:50.031
<v Speaker 1>age of 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the answer is the person who picks </v>

12
00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:52.770
<v Speaker 1>being born with an Iq in the 95th </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentile at birth,</v>

13
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.260
<v Speaker 1>it's more powerful predictor of longterm</v>
<v Speaker 1>life outcome.</v>

14
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>Then familiar wealth so</v>

15
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.470
<v Speaker 1>and it shows up everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things we did recently </v>

16
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.831
<v Speaker 1>was looking at disgust sensitivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk a little bit about </v>

17
00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:10.370
<v Speaker 1>that when we talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness because orderly people</v>

18
00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:13.640
<v Speaker 1>seem to be more sensitive to discuss the</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorderly people.</v>

19
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be why they're orderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the higher you are in Icu,</v>

20
00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:23.750
<v Speaker 1>the less disgust sensitive you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we don't know exactly why that is.</v>

21
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:28.751
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could make the inference that </v>

22
00:01:28.751 --> 00:01:33.011
<v Speaker 1>Iq is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is interrelated in some way to the </v>

23
00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:35.030
<v Speaker 1>physiological integrity of the cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

24
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.060
<v Speaker 1>rather than the limbic system which you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know is the source of say emotions and </v>

25
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.291
<v Speaker 1>motivations and the more powerful it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more inhibitory capacity it has over</v>

26
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:50.930
<v Speaker 1>the more fundamental motivations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions you could make.</v>

27
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:52.670
<v Speaker 1>That case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Problem is,</v>

28
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:57.671
<v Speaker 1>is that intelligent people don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily seem to be any less </v>

29
00:01:57.671 --> 00:02:01.811
<v Speaker 1>impulsive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and you can have a pretty vicious </v>

30
00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:06.971
<v Speaker 1>personality disorder that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by extremely disorganized </v>

31
00:02:06.971 --> 00:02:10.331
<v Speaker 1>behavior and a complete inability to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm plans into operation and still </v>

32
00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:15.131
<v Speaker 1>have a high Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are the things we really can't </v>

33
00:02:15.131 --> 00:02:19.541
<v Speaker 1>figure out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a hell of a thing to try to </v>

34
00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:22.220
<v Speaker 1>figure out is like the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Iq and industriousness is zero</v>

35
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>and that just makes no sense to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because most of the brain models are </v>

36
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.881
<v Speaker 1>predicated on the idea that your ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to engage in longterm planning is a </v>

37
00:02:33.521 --> 00:02:35.680
<v Speaker 1>factor that's associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

38
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.480
<v Speaker 1>But then industrious people seem to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only engage in longterm planning,</v>

39
00:02:40.481 --> 00:02:43.120
<v Speaker 1>they seem to do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then if they're more industrious,</v>

40
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:46.030
<v Speaker 1>they put their plans into operation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the plan is actually work,</v>

41
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's not correlated with our queue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I can't figure out,</v>

42
00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:55.741
<v Speaker 1>well obviously the industrious person in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some way is able to regulate their own </v>

43
00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:57.880
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not procrastinating,</v>

44
00:02:57.881 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'd think that that the ability to</v>

45
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>not procrastinate would be a cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>feature,</v>

46
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:09.751
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't seem to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have no idea what makes people </v>

47
00:03:09.751 --> 00:03:12.721
<v Speaker 1>industrious and we can't figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's this incredibly potent </v>

48
00:03:12.721 --> 00:03:16.411
<v Speaker 1>predictors just about as powerful as ICU</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have no idea what it is.</v>

49
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

50
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think,</v>

51
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>if you have a smart idea about that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to pursue it,</v>

52
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>like feel free because there's a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>mystery there that no one's been able to</v>

53
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>crack and we'd been at it for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and have had almost no success.</v>

54
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had people do things like give them </v>

55
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.301
<v Speaker 1>sentences of ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ams and use sort of randomly distributed</v>

56
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 1>and then we'd have them count the use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:44.350
<v Speaker 1>like a whole page of sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not sentences.</v>

58
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>So just strings of letter count the use </v>
<v Speaker 1>how useless,</v>

59
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:52.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd think that someone industrious </v>

60
00:03:52.681 --> 00:03:52.681
<v Speaker 1>would do that better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they don't.</v>

61
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.720
<v Speaker 1>That's an Iq test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who can count the use faster </v>

62
00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>have hierarchy cues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost everything that you would do that</v>

63
00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:04.591
<v Speaker 1>would wear it has to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulation of abstractions of any </v>

64
00:04:04.591 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 1>sort.</v>

65
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Even something that basic seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally associated with Iq.</v>

66
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.250
<v Speaker 1>People with higher iqs have slightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger heads.</v>

67
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>If you control for body size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have slightly bigger brains.</v>

68
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.700
<v Speaker 1>If you control for body size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the axons on their neurons are a bit </v>

69
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.901
<v Speaker 1>thicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the electrical messages seem to </v>

70
00:04:24.901 --> 00:04:25.510
<v Speaker 1>travel a little bit more efficiency </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiently.</v>

71
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 1>They are slightly faster in simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>reflex test.</v>

72
00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 1>So it goes right down to the level of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're simple reflex light goes</v>

73
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:37.711
<v Speaker 1>on question bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not many neurons mediating that </v>

74
00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:37.711
<v Speaker 1>response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 1>chains of neurons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only a few neurons communicating</v>

76
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:44.671
<v Speaker 1>so that you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even at that relatively simple </v>

77
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:46.930
<v Speaker 1>processing level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq is associated with speed.</v>

78
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:51.931
<v Speaker 1>So there's a physiological component,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're less likely to develop </v>

79
00:04:51.931 --> 00:04:52.360
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's disease if you have a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq.</v>

80
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.360
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's because your brain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just more robust,</v>

81
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you could sustain damage,</v>

82
00:04:57.941 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 1>say up to 50 percent of your brain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't even show it if you're,</v>

83
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.460
<v Speaker 1>if you have a sufficiently high Iq.</v>

84
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 1>if you're on the bottom end of the ICU </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>

86
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 1>you're much more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you seem to be much more susceptible to,</v>

87
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.350
<v Speaker 1>to physiological damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nutrition is a big predictor of Iq </v>

88
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.870
<v Speaker 1>variation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

89
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of that's been hammered out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern societies,</v>

90
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:22.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so 150 years ago,</v>

91
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.020
<v Speaker 1>people's Iq was pretty tightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with their nutritional </v>

92
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.020
<v Speaker 1>status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now,</v>

93
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are very few people in North </v>

94
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.500
<v Speaker 1>America who don't have enough to eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though there's some variation in </v>

95
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.710
<v Speaker 1>quality of diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's flat note a lot of the,</v>

96
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural variability in an intelligence.</v>
