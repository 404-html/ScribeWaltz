00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2
00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:03.930
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in sleeping beauty,</v>

3
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping beauty goes to sleep and the </v>

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>reason she goes to sleep is because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to remember what happens is she has</v>

5
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>parents who were quite old and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty desperate to have a child</v>

6
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.820
<v Speaker 1>like so many people are now and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>only have one child like so many people </v>

7
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>do now and they don't want anything to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to this child because like,</v>

8
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:27.891
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a miracle and there's only one of </v>

9
00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:30.351
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so she's the princess and so it's </v>

10
00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>like we're not letting anything around </v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

11
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>So they have a big christening party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

12
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.370
<v Speaker 1>And they invite everybody but they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>invite maleficent and Melissa sent is </v>

13
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 1>the terrible mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's nature.</v>

14
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 1>She's like the thing that goes bump in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the night.</v>

15
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:44.730
<v Speaker 1>She's the devil herself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

16
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>She's everything that you don't want </v>
<v Speaker 1>your child to encounter.</v>

17
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.960
<v Speaker 1>So the king and queen saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

18
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>we just want to invite her to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christening.</v>

19
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

20
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an eatable story,</v>

21
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:58.641
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The eatable mother is the mother who </v>

22
00:00:58.641 --> 00:00:59.670
<v Speaker 1>devours her child by refusing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by overprotecting him or her.</v>

23
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>So that instead of being strengthened by</v>
<v Speaker 1>an encounter with the terrible world,</v>

24
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.500
<v Speaker 1>they're weakened by too much protection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when they're lead out into the </v>

25
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.500
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cannot live,</v>

26
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>and that's the story of sleeping beauty </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what the king and Queen do.</v>

27
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.260
<v Speaker 1>And they apologize to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Melissa sent when she first shows up </v>

28
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.260
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

29
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a bunch of halfway did excuses</v>

30
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>why they don't invite her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We forgot.</v>

31
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

32
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't forget something like that.</v>

33
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>And she kind of makes that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>

34
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:29.880
<v Speaker 1>The whole horror of life.</v>

35
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>You don't forget about that when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a child that's for sure.</v>

36
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>You might wish that it would stay at </v>
<v Speaker 1>bay,</v>

37
00:01:34.111 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>but you do not forget about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

38
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>do you invite it to the party?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is it bloody well.</v>

39
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Depends how unconscious you want your </v>
<v Speaker 1>child to be.</v>

40
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>And if you want your child to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>

41
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>well then you have the added advantage </v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe they won't leave home.</v>

42
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.920
<v Speaker 1>And so you can take advantage of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of your sad life.</v>

43
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Instead of going off to find something </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do for yourself,</v>

44
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then of course you can take revenge </v>

45
00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.190
<v Speaker 1>on them if they do have eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

46
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.911
<v Speaker 1>what would you call impetus towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>courage that you sacrificed yourself 30 </v>

47
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 1>years ago and want to stamp out as soon </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you see it develop in your child.</v>

48
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.520
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing that would be quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasant,</v>

49
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.010
<v Speaker 1>and so that's what happens in sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty.</v>

50
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

51
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.240
<v Speaker 1>none of this is pleasant and nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens in that story is pleasant.</v>

52
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 1>So sleeping beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's naive as hell.</v>

53
00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:19.281
<v Speaker 1>They put her out in the forest and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a raised by these three like goody two </v>

54
00:02:19.281 --> 00:02:22.521
<v Speaker 1>shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ferries that are also completely devoid </v>

55
00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:22.521
<v Speaker 1>of any real potency and power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

56
00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:24.330
<v Speaker 1>There's no nothing maleficent about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

57
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>And then the first idiot prints that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanders by,</v>

58
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:31.881
<v Speaker 1>she falls in love with so badly that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>has post traumatic stress disorder </v>

59
00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>really writes off on his horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

60
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she,</v>

61
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>then she goes into the castle and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all freaked out because she met the love</v>

62
00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:41.070
<v Speaker 1>of her life for like five minutes for </v>
<v Speaker 1>God's sake.</v>

63
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.170
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when the spinning wheel,</v>

64
00:02:43.171 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>that's the wheel of fate pops up and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>picks her finger right?</v>

65
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.390
<v Speaker 1>They tried to get rid of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spinning wheels,</v>

66
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:51.060
<v Speaker 1>they tried to get rid of all the wheels </v>
<v Speaker 1>of fate with their pointed end,</v>

67
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.330
<v Speaker 1>but she finds it poke her fingers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>finger falls down unconscious while she </v>

68
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.150
<v Speaker 1>wants to be unconscious.</v>

69
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>And no bloody wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was protected whole life.</v>

70
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>She so damn naive that her first love </v>
<v Speaker 1>affair just about kills her.</v>

71
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 1>She wants to go to sleep and never wake </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

72
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.310
<v Speaker 1>And so that's exactly what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she has to wait for the prince </v>

73
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>to come and rescue her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you think,</v>

74
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>how sexist can you get that story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

75
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.010
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's,</v>

76
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.220
<v Speaker 1>that's the way that that would be red.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the modern world it's like she </v>

77
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.651
<v Speaker 1>doesn't need a prince to rescue her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why Disney made frozen that </v>

78
00:03:22.651 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>absolutely appalling piece of rubbish.</v>

79
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

80
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:37.411
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the princess doesn't need a prince </v>

81
00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:37.411
<v Speaker 1>to rescue her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

82
00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:41.390
<v Speaker 1>that's a boneheaded way of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story because the prince isn't just </v>

83
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>a man who's coming to rescue the woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>and believe me,</v>

84
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 1>he's got his own problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

85
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:48.901
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold God damn dragon he has to contend </v>

86
00:03:48.901 --> 00:03:48.901
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

87
00:03:48.901 --> 00:03:51.310
<v Speaker 1>But the prince also represents the </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman's own consciousness.</v>

88
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:56.311
<v Speaker 1>That consciousness is presented very </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently and stories as symbolically </v>

89
00:03:56.311 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 1>masculine as it is with the logos idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that without,</v>

90
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 1>without that forward going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>courageous consciousness,</v>

91
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.770
<v Speaker 1>a woman herself will drift into </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconsciousness and terror and so you </v>

92
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.461
<v Speaker 1>can read it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The woman who's sleeping needs a man to </v>

93
00:04:11.461 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>wake her up and of course just like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>man needs a woman to wake him up.</v>

94
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>It's the same damn thing that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragon fight in sleeping beauty.</v>

95
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 1>But it's also the case that if she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>only unconscious,</v>

96
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>all she can do is lay there and sleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sleep of the naive and damned.</v>

97
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 1>She has to wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wake herself up,</v>

98
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.550
<v Speaker 1>and bring her own consciousness around </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine consciousness into the </v>

99
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 1>forefront so that she can survive in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

100
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.320
<v Speaker 1>And of course women are trying to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that like mad,</v>

101
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.020
<v Speaker 1>but that's partly what's represented in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the store like that.</v>

102
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly what's implicit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea is that unless the woman is </v>

103
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 1>taken out of man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

104
00:04:44.891 --> 00:04:47.740
<v Speaker 1>then she isn't a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just a creature.</v>

105
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly what's embedded in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this story.</v>

106
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to read it as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal.</v>

107
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to read anything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

108
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.680
<v Speaker 1>So really it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

109
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't,</v>

110
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I won't bother with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really we can do better than that.</v>

111
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
