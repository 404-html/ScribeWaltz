1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.370
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you want to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the conception,</v>

2
00:00:02.371 --> 00:00:07.371
<v Speaker 1>like compassionate as you actually want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to start thinking about it like a </v>

3
00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:09.860
<v Speaker 1>psychologist or like a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because compassion is actually definable</v>

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.530
<v Speaker 1>and it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the easiest way to approach it </v>

5
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.620
<v Speaker 1>is to think about it in big five terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it.</v>

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.720
<v Speaker 1>It maps onto agreeableness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially you can break agreeableness </v>

7
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.910
<v Speaker 1>down into compassion and politeness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the liberal types,</v>

8
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>especially the social justice types are </v>
<v Speaker 1>way higher in compassion.</v>

9
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>It's actually their fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristic and you might think,</v>

10
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:32.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion is is a virtue.</v>

11
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

12
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>it is average you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but any unit,</v>

13
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:41.541
<v Speaker 1>dimensional virtue immediately becomes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vice because real virtue is the </v>

14
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:45.710
<v Speaker 1>intermingling of a number of virtues and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their and their integration into a </v>

15
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 1>functional identity that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressed socially and compassion.</v>

16
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Passion is great if you happen to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entity towards which it is directive,</v>

17
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.340
<v Speaker 1>but compassion tends to divide the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a crying children and predatory </v>

18
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 1>snakes.</v>

19
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're a crying child,</v>

20
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great man,</v>

21
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 1>but if you happen to be identified as </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the predatory snakes,</v>

22
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.810
<v Speaker 1>you better look the hell out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

23
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate is what the mother,</v>

24
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bear feels for her cubs when she</v>
<v Speaker 1>eats you because you've got in the way.</v>

25
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

26
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:25.100
<v Speaker 1>So we don't want to be thinking for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second that compassion isn't a,</v>

27
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a virtue that could lead to violence </v>

28
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>because it certainly can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other problem with compassion,</v>

29
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>this is why we have conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

30
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.830
<v Speaker 1>There's five canonical personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions.</v>

31
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Agreeableness is pretty good if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing,</v>

32
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in akin system,</v>

33
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>you want to distribute resources </v>
<v Speaker 1>equally,</v>

34
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among your children,</v>

35
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.960
<v Speaker 1>because you want all of them to have not</v>
<v Speaker 1>only the same chance you even walk them </v>

36
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 1>roughly to have the same outcome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good one,</v>

37
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.870
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is you can't extend that</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral network to larger groups.</v>

38
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Not as far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need conscientiousness,</v>

39
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:04.971
<v Speaker 1>which is a much colder virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also a virtue that's much more </v>

40
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>concerned with larger structures over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the longer period of time.</v>

41
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can take about conscientiousness</v>

42
00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>is a form of compassion to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange form.</v>

43
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like straighten the hell out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>work hard and your life will go well.</v>

44
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how your feelings,</v>

45
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.310
<v Speaker 1>how you feel about that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like someone who's cold low in </v>

46
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness and high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

47
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 1>that's what they'll tell you every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

48
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:31.980
<v Speaker 1>don't come whining to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about your hurt feelings.</v>

49
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Do Your Goddamn job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to be out on the street?</v>

50
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:35.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

51
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:38.040
<v Speaker 1>that person's being really hard on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like not necessarily.</v>

52
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 1>They might have your long term best </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in mind and you're fortunate if</v>

53
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:47.211
<v Speaker 1>you come across someone who's like not </v>
<v Speaker 1>too radically disagreeable but </v>

54
00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:52.070
<v Speaker 1>moderately disagreeable and high in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness because the whip you </v>

55
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.070
<v Speaker 1>into shape.</v>

56
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's really helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>

57
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>you'll admire people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't be able to help it,</v>

58
00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think,</v>

59
00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:02.841
<v Speaker 1>oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person's going to be good </v>

60
00:03:02.841 --> 00:03:04.880
<v Speaker 1>inflammation even though you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel like a slug after you after </v>

61
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 1>they've taken you apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

62
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the compassion issue.</v>

63
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't just transform that </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a political stance and I think part</v>

64
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:18.331
<v Speaker 1>of what we're seeing is actually the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rise of a form of female </v>

65
00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.061
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have no idea what totalitarianism </v>

66
00:03:21.061 --> 00:03:25.051
<v Speaker 1>would be like if women ran it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's never happened before in the </v>

67
00:03:25.051 --> 00:03:29.221
<v Speaker 1>history of the planet and so we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced women into the political </v>

68
00:03:29.221 --> 00:03:33.151
<v Speaker 1>sphere radically over the last 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea what the consequences of</v>

69
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>that is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we do know from our research,</v>

70
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:40.681
<v Speaker 1>which is preliminary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that agreeableness really predicts </v>

71
00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:44.641
<v Speaker 1>political correctness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but female gender predicts over and </v>

72
00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:48.301
<v Speaker 1>above the personality trait and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something we found very rarely in our </v>

73
00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:51.871
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually the sex differences are wiped </v>

74
00:03:51.871 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>out by the personality differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not in this particular case.</v>

75
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.500
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are getting married later and </v>

76
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.741
<v Speaker 1>they're having children much later and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're having fewer of them and so you </v>

77
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.951
<v Speaker 1>also have to wonder what their feminine </v>
<v Speaker 1>orientation is doing with itself in the </v>

78
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:08.440
<v Speaker 1>interim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking,</v>

79
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.020
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of it's being expressed as </v>
<v Speaker 1>political opinion,</v>

80
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 1>like in fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

81
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine,</v>

82
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's not fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it starts to shut down discussion.</v>
