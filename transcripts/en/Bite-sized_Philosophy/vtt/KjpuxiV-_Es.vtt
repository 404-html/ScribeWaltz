1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Life is suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Indisputable.</v>

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.250
<v Speaker 1>What do you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

4
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.420
<v Speaker 1>you voluntarily accepted and then strive</v>
<v Speaker 1>to overcome the suffering.</v>

5
00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:22.151
<v Speaker 1>That's a consequence of that and you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that for you and you do that in a way </v>

6
00:00:22.151 --> 00:00:26.861
<v Speaker 1>that makes it better for other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that works and one question </v>

7
00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:27.380
<v Speaker 1>might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

8
00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:30.680
<v Speaker 1>how well does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is you're.</v>

9
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.230
<v Speaker 1>The only way that you can find out is by</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying it.</v>

10
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.830
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the existential element of it.</v>

11
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.860
<v Speaker 1>The proof is to be derived by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>incarnation of the attitude in your own </v>

12
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.840
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one can tell you how it will work for</v>

13
00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:49.841
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that your destiny is to </v>

14
00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:53.111
<v Speaker 1>discover that and you have to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to make the decisions to begin </v>

15
00:00:53.111 --> 00:00:58.001
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like because you can't do this </v>

16
00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:58.001
<v Speaker 1>without commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to commit to it first.</v>

17
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:02.270
<v Speaker 1>That's the act of faith that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>character guard was so insistent upon.</v>

18
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.750
<v Speaker 1>You have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to act as if being as good.</v>

19
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to act as if truth is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathway to enlightenment.</v>

20
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to act as if I should pursue </v>
<v Speaker 1>the deepest meaning possible in my life,</v>

21
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.860
<v Speaker 1>and there's there's reasons to do none </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those,</v>

22
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.700
<v Speaker 1>their real reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's really a decision,</v>

23
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.270
<v Speaker 1>but you can't find out what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of the decision is unless </v>

24
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.361
<v Speaker 1>you make the decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the same thing happens when you </v>

25
00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:28.361
<v Speaker 1>get married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

26
00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:32.390
<v Speaker 1>if you think you might leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not married and then you think,</v>

27
00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:33.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the marriage didn't succeed.</v>

28
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:33.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

29
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:38.981
<v Speaker 1>maybe you were never married because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rule is you don't get to leave and </v>

30
00:01:38.981 --> 00:01:43.451
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason for that rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not saying that there aren't </v>

31
00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:44.210
<v Speaker 1>situations where there should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptions made for that.</v>

32
00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:47.270
<v Speaker 1>That's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is that there's some games you</v>

33
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:52.271
<v Speaker 1>don't get to play unless you're all in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing that's so </v>

34
00:01:52.271 --> 00:01:53.900
<v Speaker 1>interesting about being alive is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all in.</v>

35
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>No matter what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all in.</v>

36
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.620
<v Speaker 1>This is going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think you might as well play the </v>

37
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.800
<v Speaker 1>most magnificent game you can while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're waiting,</v>

38
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.380
<v Speaker 1>because do you have anything better to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>

39
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

40
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Pick the best thing possible that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do.</v>

41
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Why not do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could justify you're wretched </v>

42
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.800
<v Speaker 1>existence to yourself that way I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could.</v>

43
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.240
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

44
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>people find such meaning in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities they adopted,</v>

45
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.440
<v Speaker 1>stops making them ask questions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what life is for.</v>

46
00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:31.360
<v Speaker 1>If you have a newborn child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

47
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.460
<v Speaker 1>like unless you're really in a bad way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotically depressed or or maybe your</v>

48
00:02:37.481 --> 00:02:41.290
<v Speaker 1>personality really needs some retooling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stop thinking about</v>

49
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.170
<v Speaker 1>anything but ensuring that that baby is </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing well and if someone comes along </v>

50
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>and asks you an existential question </v>
<v Speaker 1>about your commitment to that,</v>

51
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>the right response is why are you asking</v>
<v Speaker 1>me such stupid questions when,</v>

52
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.860
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when this,</v>

53
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.930
<v Speaker 1>this is manifesting itself right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of your eyes like how blind can </v>

54
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:03.050
<v Speaker 1>you be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't a time for,</v>

55
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.390
<v Speaker 1>for questions about the meaning of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer is right in front of you and </v>

56
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>if you can't see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not because life has no meaning.</v>

57
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:15.421
<v Speaker 1>It's because you're blind mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they image of the Virgin </v>

58
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 1>mother and the child is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

59
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>what's the answer to the meaning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>

60
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Here's an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

61
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to criticize that.</v>

62
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go right ahead.</v>

63
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.630
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like.</v>

64
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

65
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.620
<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like a,</v>

66
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 1>you're like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you call that?</v>

67
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>A termite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowing on a temple,</v>

68
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.240
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no utility and that sort of </v>

69
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.521
<v Speaker 1>criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's blindness and it's the same thing </v>

70
00:03:42.201 --> 00:03:47.201
<v Speaker 1>with regards to the path of the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it glistens in front of you </v>

71
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:48.650
<v Speaker 1>and you can criticize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

72
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

73
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Put the cart before the horse and see </v>
<v Speaker 1>how far you get.</v>

74
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.030
<v Speaker 1>So I thought to bring full closure to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the class,</v>

75
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to solve this terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>puzzle that confronted me for and many </v>

76
00:04:08.571 --> 00:04:13.571
<v Speaker 1>other people about how it was that human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings got themselves in such a tangle </v>

77
00:04:13.851 --> 00:04:18.851
<v Speaker 1>about what they believed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a tangle that we were pointing the </v>

78
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:20.210
<v Speaker 1>ultimate weapons of destruction at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

79
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are still doing.</v>

80
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.640
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

81
00:04:25.641 --> 00:04:27.950
<v Speaker 1>well I understand that we need their </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief systems.</v>

82
00:04:27.951 --> 00:04:32.951
<v Speaker 1>They orient us and that means there will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be conflict between belief systems and </v>

83
00:04:32.991 --> 00:04:35.930
<v Speaker 1>that can be a catastrophe and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>being played out everywhere.</v>

84
00:04:35.931 --> 00:04:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in very many ways.</v>

85
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.160
<v Speaker 1>What's the solution to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

86
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 1>one possibility is there is no solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just mayhem all the way around </v>

87
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.620
<v Speaker 1>could be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seemed to me as I delved into it </v>

88
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.580
<v Speaker 1>that the proper solution to that was to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live properly as an individual because </v>

89
00:04:54.891 --> 00:04:58.580
<v Speaker 1>you're more powerful than you think way </v>
<v Speaker 1>more powerful than you think.</v>

90
00:04:58.581 --> 00:05:01.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean God only knows what you are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the final analysis.</v>

91
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.420
<v Speaker 1>You're blind to your own weaknesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also blind to your own </v>

92
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.120
<v Speaker 1>strengths and so then I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

93
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.210
<v Speaker 1>if you got your act together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be better for you and instantly it </v>

94
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.940
<v Speaker 1>would be better for your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming they wanted you to get your act</v>

95
00:05:13.941 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 1>together and not everyone does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

96
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.080
<v Speaker 1>And then it would be better for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

97
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like how far can you take that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you stopped wasting time and if you </v>

98
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.501
<v Speaker 1>start lying and if you oriented yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the highest possible good that you </v>

99
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:27.350
<v Speaker 1>could conceive of and you committed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

100
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.860
<v Speaker 1>how much good could you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

101
00:05:30.861 --> 00:05:32.750
<v Speaker 1>I would say money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find out.</v>

102
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:42.010
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I think you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should find out you don't have </v>

103
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.541
<v Speaker 1>anything better to do and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing in it as far as I've been able </v>

104
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:47.060
<v Speaker 1>to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing in it but good.</v>

105
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.880
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

106
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could sort yourself out so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you wanted nothing but the good and</v>

107
00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe you could help make that </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest in the world and maybe we </v>

108
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.320
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have all these terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

109
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Then at least we'd have fewer of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that would be a start.</v>

110
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.620
<v Speaker 1>So it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

111
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.520
<v Speaker 1>the answer to the problem of humanity is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

112
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 1>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the integrity of the individual.</v>

113
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.590
<v Speaker 1>That's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and states that are predicated on </v>

114
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 1>that realization are healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in states that aren't,</v>

115
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.060
<v Speaker 1>are doomed to stagnation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic collapse and personalities </v>

116
00:06:35.241 --> 00:06:40.241
<v Speaker 1>that are predicated on self tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the tyranny of others are doomed and</v>

117
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.540
<v Speaker 1>doomed to collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and then you think,</v>

118
00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:48.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the barrier?</v>

119
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.480
<v Speaker 1>The barriers are you willing to accept </v>
<v Speaker 1>the responsibility and part of the </v>

120
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.570
<v Speaker 1>answer to that is reduced the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility until it's tolerable.</v>

121
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to have to fix everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>at once.</v>

122
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.090
<v Speaker 1>You could just start by fixing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you could fix or you could </v>

123
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.021
<v Speaker 1>even do it more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it with even less self </v>

124
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:13.871
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could start by fixing only the </v>

125
00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:13.871
<v Speaker 1>things that you want to fix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

126
00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:16.880
<v Speaker 1>you can get a massive way that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do it.</v>

127
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.120
<v Speaker 1>See what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you should have been taught </v>

128
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.761
<v Speaker 1>in university right from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like aim at the highest good tool </v>

129
00:07:24.761 --> 00:07:29.021
<v Speaker 1>yourself into something that can attain </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and go out there and manifested in </v>

130
00:07:29.021 --> 00:07:31.460
<v Speaker 1>the world and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That everything that comes your way will</v>

131
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:31.790
<v Speaker 1>be</v>

132
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.740
<v Speaker 1>everything that comes your way will be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>blessing.</v>

133
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.280
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

134
00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:42.430
<v Speaker 1>you have to do is give up your </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment and your hatred.</v>

135
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.600
<v Speaker 1>I know that's a hard thing to give up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he had plenty of reason for it.</v>

136
00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 1>That's probably a good place to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>console.</v>

137
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:53.470
<v Speaker 2>It was a pleasure.</v>
