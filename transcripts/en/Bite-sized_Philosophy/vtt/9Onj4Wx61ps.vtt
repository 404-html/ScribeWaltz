1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.100
<v Speaker 1>And then when the Marxist say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2
00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:04.980
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't real Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it really means,</v>

3
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:06.660
<v Speaker 1>and I've thought about this for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

4
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:10.200
<v Speaker 1>it's the most arrogant possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement anyone could ever make.</v>

5
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>It means if I would have been in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stalin's position,</v>

6
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:18.381
<v Speaker 1>I would have ushered in the damn utopia </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead that instead of the genocidal </v>

7
00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>massacres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I understand the doctrine of </v>

8
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Marxism and everything about me is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

9
00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think again sunshine.</v>

10
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.950
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand it and you're not </v>

11
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the power was in your hands,</v>

12
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.460
<v Speaker 1>assuming you had the competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you don't,</v>

13
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have done any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even if you had,</v>

14
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:44.181
<v Speaker 1>there would have been someone else </v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting right behind you to shoot you </v>

15
00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:45.150
<v Speaker 1>the first time you actually tried to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything good.</v>

16
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happened to all the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>guard who ran the damn revolution.</v>

17
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.960
<v Speaker 1>Stalin rounded them all up and shot them</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with their families and millions </v>

18
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.191
<v Speaker 1>of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if you do happen to be that </v>

19
00:00:58.191 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Avatar of moral purity that you claim </v>
<v Speaker 1>implicitly,</v>

20
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.120
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you get to act out </v>
<v Speaker 1>your goodness in relationship to those </v>

21
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.020
<v Speaker 1>possessed by Your radiology is zero.</v>
