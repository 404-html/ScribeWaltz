00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Part of spiritual development is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize the satanic tendencies that </v>

2
00:00:05.991 --> 00:00:10.991
<v Speaker 1>characterize you and to fully wrestle </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them and to and to integrate them.</v>

3
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much to cast them away,</v>

4
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.140
<v Speaker 1>it's to transmute them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.280
<v Speaker 1>and you can see the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who've done that and people who </v>

6
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.741
<v Speaker 1>haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree because people </v>

7
00:00:26.741 --> 00:00:29.471
<v Speaker 1>who haven't integrated the shadow at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>are naive and you can tell that when you</v>

8
00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:34.571
<v Speaker 1>look at them and you can tell that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk to them and because they're </v>

9
00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:38.171
<v Speaker 1>naive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're often resentful as well because </v>

10
00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>they get taken advantage of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's integrated that more,</v>

11
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:42.890
<v Speaker 1>they're dangerous in the martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of way,</v>

12
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:45.380
<v Speaker 1>which is they're dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't have to be.</v>

13
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.770
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to use it because their </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence radiates.</v>

14
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.180
<v Speaker 1>What would you say it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't radiate threat.</v>

15
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well certainly strength,</v>

16
00:01:00.851 --> 00:01:01.330
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

17
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.600
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the potential for havoc.</v>

18
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 1>That's the right way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

19
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an implicit potential for havoc </v>

20
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>and that's really necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

21
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that gives people self</v>

22
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:20.721
<v Speaker 1>respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an interesting thing about the </v>

23
00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:22.651
<v Speaker 1>integration of the shadow because </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing yourself as the locus of </v>

24
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say actually in some sense gives </v>

25
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.151
<v Speaker 1>you far more respect for yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>strangely enough because the same </v>

26
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:35.740
<v Speaker 1>respect that you might have for a wild </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal or even a monster.</v>

27
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like in those so then maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to treat yourself differently like</v>

28
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I think this is particularly true with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards to the discipline of children.</v>

29
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know that you're a monster and </v>

30
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.011
<v Speaker 1>that that will manifest itself in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life consciously or unconsciously and </v>

31
00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:53.330
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

32
00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:54.520
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not good,</v>

33
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.530
<v Speaker 1>then you become better at disciplining </v>
<v Speaker 1>children and the reason for that is that</v>

34
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.860
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to expose them to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark side.</v>

35
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.400
<v Speaker 1>And so if they behave and don't provoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

36
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.800
<v Speaker 1>which means they'll also behave for </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>

37
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>then you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The monstrous part can stay in abeyance </v>

38
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>and then that's great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't understand yourself as </v>

39
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.921
<v Speaker 1>capable of wreaking havoc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that can be the kind of havoc that </v>

40
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:22.921
<v Speaker 1>unfolds over decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

41
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're going to abuse a </v>
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>

42
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.330
<v Speaker 1>it's the primitive form of abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physical abuse,</v>

43
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>the sophisticated form of abuse is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>continual undermining of the child's </v>

44
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.651
<v Speaker 1>courage across perhaps their entire life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that there's a terribly monstrous </v>

45
00:02:37.781 --> 00:02:42.781
<v Speaker 1>element to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're not respected properly by </v>

46
00:02:43.061 --> 00:02:48.061
<v Speaker 1>the child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say you will absolutely take revenge on </v>

47
00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:50.470
<v Speaker 1>them and you know that's a whole in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

48
00:02:50.471 --> 00:02:52.720
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole Freudian psychoanalytic</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

49
00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:55.390
<v Speaker 1>It's just not all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a huge part of it.</v>

50
00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>So interesting that you say that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to the fact that you're dangerous</v>

51
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 2>or become dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'd also say that if you haven't</v>

52
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:09.121
<v Speaker 2>done that kind of shadow work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't made friends with your </v>

53
00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:09.121
<v Speaker 2>anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't integrated it,</v>

54
00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 2>you're actually more dangerous because </v>
<v Speaker 2>then things will happen that will.</v>

55
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.770
<v Speaker 2>It will come out in a way that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

56
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes out disintegrated.</v>

57
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.800
<v Speaker 1>So it comes out as an autonomous spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

58
00:03:18.801 --> 00:03:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Under no one's control and that's like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>burst of rage.</v>

59
00:03:21.921 --> 00:03:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

60
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you hear about a mother who's done </v>

61
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 1>something terrible to one of her </v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

62
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.760
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the reason is that,</v>

63
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

64
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>maybe she's just been laid off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she went out and had too much to </v>

65
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:36.650
<v Speaker 1>drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she's hung over,</v>

66
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

67
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.590
<v Speaker 1>she's angry and lonesome and she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed by the responsibility of the</v>

68
00:03:42.591 --> 00:03:47.591
<v Speaker 1>children and she has a child who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>testing and she doesn't know how to </v>

69
00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:52.961
<v Speaker 1>limit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one day the child tests at exactly </v>

70
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:55.670
<v Speaker 1>the wrong time and it's like mayhem and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody goes,</v>

71
00:03:55.671 --> 00:03:56.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

72
00:03:56.541 --> 00:03:57.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

73
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>seven terrible things came together at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time and produced this outburst</v>

74
00:04:04.701 --> 00:04:09.701
<v Speaker 1>of disintegrated rage and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look the hell out when that happens.</v>

75
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.200
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

76
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.270
<v Speaker 1>you want to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You either you either have that or it </v>

77
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:22.091
<v Speaker 1>has you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the options and you don't </v>

78
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:23.360
<v Speaker 1>become safe by being castrated.</v>
