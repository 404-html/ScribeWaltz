1
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>I guess passive resistance or nonviolent</v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance?</v>

2
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.860
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3
00:00:09.861 --> 00:00:13.460
<v Speaker 1>not nonresistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually.</v>

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.870
<v Speaker 1>It's one step further than nonviolence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't even resist.</v>

5
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.240
<v Speaker 1>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what tolstoy was talking about.</v>

6
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.930
<v Speaker 1>It's from the sermon of the Mount where </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ said,</v>

7
00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:26.690
<v Speaker 1>resist not evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like,</v>

8
00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:31.691
<v Speaker 1>you don't even resist it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought that there was a </v>

9
00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:31.691
<v Speaker 1>metaphysics to that potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Well then I would say that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

11
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>you've asked me a question that I can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

12
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that would be in the same line </v>

13
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.030
<v Speaker 1>as turned the other cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's,</v>

14
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.070
<v Speaker 1>that's in a way it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some nuance there.</v>

16
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:55.701
<v Speaker 1>I thought there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is because turn the other cheek </v>

17
00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:58.701
<v Speaker 1>means don't participate in an escalating</v>
<v Speaker 1>cycle of violence and that's reasonable </v>

18
00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That if you can do that,</v>

19
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.770
<v Speaker 1>resist not evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when I go into the sermon on </v>

20
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.241
<v Speaker 1>the mount,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go into all the individual lines and </v>

21
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>look up multiple translations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple interpretations and try to.</v>

22
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Because sometimes though it's extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>

23
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:24.231
<v Speaker 1>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there's a line in the new </v>

24
00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 1>testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the meek shall inherit the earth.</v>

25
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.000
<v Speaker 1>That's not the right translation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

26
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>That is not what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means,</v>

27
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 1>and it's Germane to our discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means those who have those who are </v>

28
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>competent to use force but do not wield </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

29
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Speaker 1>will inherit the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a whole different issue.</v>

30
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.460
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see exactly what resists</v>
<v Speaker 1>not means because my suspicions are that</v>

31
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:59.871
<v Speaker 1>the devil's in the details,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely a sufficiently </v>

32
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 1>jarring an injunction to be worthy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>further investigation bit especially </v>

33
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:11.981
<v Speaker 1>because I've heard you talk in the past </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how how futile it is to show up </v>

34
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:15.110
<v Speaker 1>somewhere with a placard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably a very expressed version</v>

35
00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:19.100
<v Speaker 1>of of how resisting what you deem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

36
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Just the act of resisting it alone is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless.</v>

37
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a waste of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

38
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Like actual energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very interesting.</v>

39
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a very interesting take on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I think it's interesting.</v>

40
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:36.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I've been thinking about </v>

41
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 1>continuing my whatever you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe it as struggle,</v>

42
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>let's say with the the forces that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupting the university.</v>

43
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I thought for a long time in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>war metaphors with regards to that and </v>

44
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:55.611
<v Speaker 1>then over the summer when I got a bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a break and was able to think more </v>

45
00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>clearly or begin to think more clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>about whatever it is I might be doing,</v>

46
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.230
<v Speaker 1>I realized that my primary role on </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube and perhaps publicly is not</v>

47
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>the leader of a war against the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice warriors.</v>

48
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.940
<v Speaker 1>It's more like think of encouragement </v>
<v Speaker 1>and education with that as a side </v>

49
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

50
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even a concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's a war,</v>

51
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:22.040
<v Speaker 1>then it's the wrong approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

52
00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>you're stuck is maybe you also dignify </v>
<v Speaker 1>your enemy with a war.</v>

53
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.000
<v Speaker 1>You actually encode their power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

54
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Resistance as a waste of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really useful.</v>

55
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 1>A waste of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It you bet.</v>

56
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 1>You Bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:41.680
<v Speaker 1>it has all those aspects we discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has the glorification of the enemy as</v>

58
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:46.681
<v Speaker 1>well because it might be far more </v>
<v Speaker 1>effective to say that whole thing is,</v>

59
00:03:50.511 --> 00:03:52.010
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a different way.</v>
