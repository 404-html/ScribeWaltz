1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well so,</v>

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.070
<v Speaker 1>so that that's another issue in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense that seems to make the </v>

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>postmodernist critique even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

4
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:13.101
<v Speaker 1>How in the world and going to extract </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and canonical interpretation of </v>

5
00:00:13.101 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not possible,</v>

6
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>but here's the issue as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the interpreter,</v>

7
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.300
<v Speaker 1>so in the postmodernists extended that </v>
<v Speaker 1>critique to the world,</v>

8
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

9
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a text is complicated enough.</v>

10
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>You can extract out a canonical </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation.</v>

11
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>What about the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world is way more complicated than a</v>

12
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:34.551
<v Speaker 1>text and so there's an infinite number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of ways that you can look at the world </v>

13
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>and so how do we know that any one way </v>
<v Speaker 1>is better than any other way?</v>

14
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the postmodern answer was we can't </v>

15
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 1>and that's not a good answer because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>drowned in chaos under those </v>

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.650
<v Speaker 1>You can't make sense of anything and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good because</v>

18
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.790
<v Speaker 1>it's not neutral to not make sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

19
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>It's very anxiety provoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very depressing because if things </v>

20
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.050
<v Speaker 1>are so chaotic that you can't get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>handle on them,</v>

21
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.230
<v Speaker 1>your body defaults into emergency </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparation mode and your heart rate </v>

22
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.000
<v Speaker 1>goes up and your immune system stops </v>
<v Speaker 1>working and like you burn yourself out,</v>

23
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:15.470
<v Speaker 1>you age rapidly because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by nothing you can control.</v>

24
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.810
<v Speaker 1>It's varying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an existential crisis,</v>

25
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:19.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's anxiety provoking in depressing,</v>

26
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.700
<v Speaker 1>very hard on people and even more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

27
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.900
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that the way that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed neurophysiologically is that</v>

28
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:30.740
<v Speaker 1>we don't experience any positive emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless we have an aim</v>

29
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.680
<v Speaker 1>and we can see ourselves progressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards that aim.</v>

30
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.150
<v Speaker 1>It isn't precisely attaining the aim </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes us happy.</v>

31
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.360
<v Speaker 1>As you all know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever attained anything because</v>

32
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.470
<v Speaker 1>soon as you attain it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the whole little game ends and you </v>

33
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.850
<v Speaker 1>have to come up with another game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

34
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:50.980
<v Speaker 1>So it's sisyphus and that's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

35
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>but it does show that the attainment </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be the thing that drives you </v>

36
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.361
<v Speaker 1>because it collapses the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens when you graduate </v>

37
00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:02.361
<v Speaker 1>from university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're king of the mountain </v>

38
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 1>for one day and then you're like surf </v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

39
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

40
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:05.860
<v Speaker 1>at starbucks for the next five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.900
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what happens is that that human </v>

42
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 1>beings are weird creatures because we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more activated by having an aim and</v>

43
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 1>moving towards it than we are by </v>
<v Speaker 1>attainment.</v>

44
00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:22.671
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is you have to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>an aim and that means you have to have </v>

45
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>an interpretation and it also means that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nobler aim,</v>

46
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>that's one way of thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better your life.</v>

47
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really interesting thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know because you know,</v>

48
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.690
<v Speaker 1>you've heard ever since you were tiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should act like a good person </v>

49
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.690
<v Speaker 1>and you shouldn't lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

50
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.530
<v Speaker 1>and you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

51
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.280
<v Speaker 1>why the hell should I not like a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>person?</v>

52
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Why not lie in even a three year old can</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask that question because smart,</v>

53
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>smart kids learn to lie earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

54
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 1>and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

55
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.450
<v Speaker 1>why not twist the fabric of reality so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it serves your specific short term </v>

56
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>needs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

57
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>that's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not do that?</v>

58
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.190
<v Speaker 1>Why Act morally if you can get away with</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and it brings you closer to </v>

59
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>something you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why not do it?</v>

60
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>These are good questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not self evident.</v>

61
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be tied in with what I just </v>

62
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.740
<v Speaker 1>mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you destabilize yourself and </v>

63
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.740
<v Speaker 1>things become chaotic.</v>

64
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>That's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't have a no blame,</v>

65
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:20.431
<v Speaker 1>then you have nothing but but shallow </v>
<v Speaker 1>trivial pleasures and they don't sustain</v>

66
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 1>you and that's not good because because </v>
<v Speaker 1>life is so difficult,</v>

67
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so much suffering.</v>

68
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:33.271
<v Speaker 1>It's so complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It ends and everyone dies and it's </v>

69
00:03:33.271 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>painful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like without a noble aim,</v>

70
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>how can you withstand any of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

71
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 1>You become desperate and once you become</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperate things go.</v>

72
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>Things go from bad to worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly when you become desperate,</v>

73
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>and so there's the idea of the noble aim</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not something.</v>

74
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.190
<v Speaker 1>It's something that's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the bread that people cannot live </v>

75
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.190
<v Speaker 1>without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

76
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 1>That's not physical bread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the noble aim and what is that?</v>

77
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was encapsulated in part in the story</v>

78
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>of Marduk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

79
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 1>that's to pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to speak properly,</v>

80
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>it's to confront chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to make a better world.</v>

81
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.970
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough of a no blame so that you can </v>

82
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:12.500
<v Speaker 1>stand up without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.640
<v Speaker 1>cringing at the very thought of your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence so that you can do something </v>

84
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>that's worthwhile to justify your </v>
<v Speaker 1>wretched position on the planet.</v>

85
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.910
<v Speaker 1>So now there's a literary issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>

86
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take a text,</v>

87
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:31.480
<v Speaker 1>you can interpret it a variety of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not right.</v>

88
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.310
<v Speaker 1>This is where the postmodernist went </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong because what you're looking for in</v>

89
00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 1>a text and in the world for that matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

90
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.490
<v Speaker 1>is sufficient order and direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then we have to think,</v>

91
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:47.491
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is sufficient order and direction </v>

92
00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:49.561
<v Speaker 1>means well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to suffer so much that </v>

93
00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:49.561
<v Speaker 1>your life is unbearable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

94
00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 1>That just seems self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pain argues for itself,</v>

95
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.090
<v Speaker 1>I think of pain as the fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality because no one disputes it,</v>

96
00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

97
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean even if you say that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in pain,</v>

98
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't help when you're in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still believe in it,</v>

99
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:05.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

100
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:06.370
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

101
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.510
<v Speaker 1>You can't pry it up with logic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rationality,</v>

102
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:15.511
<v Speaker 1>it just stands forthe as as what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundament of existence and that's </v>

103
00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:16.420
<v Speaker 1>actually quite useful to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

104
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:21.421
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want any more of that than is </v>

105
00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 1>absolutely necessary and I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>self evident and then you say,</v>

106
00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:23.890
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more complicated than that.</v>

107
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.160
<v Speaker 1>You don't want any more of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's necessary today,</v>

108
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.190
<v Speaker 1>but also not tomorrow and not next week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not next month,</v>

109
00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.220
<v Speaker 1>not next year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so however you act now better not </v>

110
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.421
<v Speaker 1>compromise how you're going to be in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year because that would just be </v>

111
00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:42.510
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the problem with short </v>

112
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.510
<v Speaker 1>term pleasures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

113
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like active haste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repented leisure.</v>

114
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:49.201
<v Speaker 1>Everyone knows exactly what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to act in a way that works </v>

115
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:50.890
<v Speaker 1>now and tomorrow and next week and next </v>
<v Speaker 1>month and so forth,</v>

116
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:55.891
<v Speaker 1>and so you have to take your future self</v>
<v Speaker 1>into account and human beings can do </v>

117
00:05:55.891 --> 00:05:59.360
<v Speaker 1>that and taking your future self into </v>
<v Speaker 1>account isn't much different than taking</v>

118
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 1>other people into account.</v>

119
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I remember there's this Simpson </v>

120
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.981
<v Speaker 1>episode and a homer downs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quart of Manet's and vodka.</v>

121
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.540
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm someone's.</v>

122
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.430
<v Speaker 1>Marge says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:21.431
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't really do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and homer says that's a problem for </v>

124
00:06:21.431 --> 00:06:21.431
<v Speaker 1>future homer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I share.</v>

125
00:06:21.431 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glad I'm not that guy.</v>
