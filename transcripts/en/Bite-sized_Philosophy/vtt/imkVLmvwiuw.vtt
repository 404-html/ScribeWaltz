1
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Is it morally right to bring people into</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence without their consent and </v>

2
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.280
<v Speaker 1>knowing that they will inevitably </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrude suffering during their life?</v>

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it selfish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good question.</v>

4
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>Tolstoy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked that question.</v>

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>So if you're interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an answer that question.</v>

6
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I would recommend that</v>

7
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.280
<v Speaker 1>you read that book because that was kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of history.</v>

8
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.590
<v Speaker 1>We looked at last thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.810
<v Speaker 1>He tells this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a story about this guy.</v>

10
00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>You told her he's being chased by people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who want to kill him.</v>

11
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.250
<v Speaker 1>So he jumps into this hole and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging on.</v>

12
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like an old whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hanging on for dear life to this </v>

13
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>scratching and at the bottom of the hole</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a crocodile and so he's hanging </v>

14
00:00:55.301 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always.</v>

15
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.630
<v Speaker 1>How you gone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He noticed this two phase.</v>

16
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.840
<v Speaker 1>There's some grapes on the vine and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's about two mice,</v>

17
00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:04.010
<v Speaker 1>one's black and one's white and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden they're on.</v>

18
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.750
<v Speaker 1>You either started buying into chewing </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it so he knows,</v>

19
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Nick Yoder,</v>

20
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.620
<v Speaker 1>you could fall and get killed or he </v>
<v Speaker 1>could wait last.</v>

21
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.180
<v Speaker 1>So what do you guys eat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The grapes,</v>

22
00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:21.181
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a Buddhist store that was story </v>

23
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:24.990
<v Speaker 1>because the white mouse is chaos or </v>
<v Speaker 1>order in the black house is chaos and </v>

24
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.500
<v Speaker 1>there's always things working at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vitamin B.</v>

25
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.590
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're screwed no matter what </v>

26
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.281
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the moral of that story and </v>

27
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:35.281
<v Speaker 1>tolstoy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looked at that story and said,</v>

28
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:37.090
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only logical conclusion that you can</v>

29
00:01:37.091 --> 00:01:40.120
<v Speaker 1>draw from that is that life is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible that it shouldn't exist.</v>

30
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>And hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dusty asked the same question in </v>

31
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>probably is chromosome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have this therapy.</v>

32
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.660
<v Speaker 1>It was just smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good wrote being tough guy,</v>

33
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>good intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptive and yes,</v>

34
00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.610
<v Speaker 1>this revenue down the Osha who's kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

35
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.660
<v Speaker 1>He's a soft guy in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not an intellect,</v>

36
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:07.661
<v Speaker 1>but he's really a good person now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just kind of classically </v>

37
00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:09.090
<v Speaker 1>religious sneezes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be vitiated monastery again.</v>

38
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.710
<v Speaker 1>And I would just talk to the because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>can blow over with his intellect.</v>

39
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:18.711
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can tell us the story about the </v>

40
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Gospel asked you took from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper,</v>

41
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.670
<v Speaker 1>this family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother and father,</v>

42
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.810
<v Speaker 1>they were angry at their four year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter and her house overnight and she</v>

43
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:35.541
<v Speaker 1>was screaming out there using and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>even basically says to know who's making</v>

44
00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:45.811
<v Speaker 1>the case for the goodness of being on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the goodness of God even says bothered.</v>

45
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.390
<v Speaker 1>How can you bothered?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is the sort of thing that</v>

46
00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:56.370
<v Speaker 1>happens in the world all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you ask them what the Osha Law,</v>

47
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.400
<v Speaker 1>when you willing voluntary torture that </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl to get to ensure that things would </v>

48
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 1>continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alicia says,</v>

49
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

50
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 1>I was doing and what I know you wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

51
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:13.261
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your conclusion about that being </v>

52
00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:16.170
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't exist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Girtha asks the same question.</v>

53
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 1>He is a firehouse is character in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

54
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>that the software works and metastases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of the intellectual ankle </v>

55
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>of Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of thinking about it.</v>

56
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 1>And he says the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about his motivation.</v>

57
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

58
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>what motivates the great adversary of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind?</v>

59
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Straightforward being so terrible that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be eradicated.</v>

60
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.210
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

61
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Strong people try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not clear to me that that's where </v>

62
00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 1>we should go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because as far as I can tell,</v>

63
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>when people work for the eradication of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

64
00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 1>it makes everything that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>complaining about way worse,</v>

65
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.640
<v Speaker 1>really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the other thing you might </v>

66
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that's the motivation?</v>

67
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.510
<v Speaker 1>It's really so pure heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know they're going to destroy </v>

68
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>mankind to save and they're making a </v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment.</v>

69
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>The judgment is being is so terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it shouldn't exist.</v>

70
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>

71
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I get the rationale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ivan's rationale.</v>

72
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:23.350
<v Speaker 1>It was never clicked more strongly than </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the brothers Karamazov.</v>

73
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:24.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a famous passage and writing.</v>

74
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 1>So the question is with regards to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing children into the world,</v>

75
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a variation of the same question.</v>

76
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.920
<v Speaker 1>You know the question is what do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to conclude if you're not willing </v>

77
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.011
<v Speaker 1>to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're completely with bed is not with </v>

78
00:04:41.011 --> 00:04:44.130
<v Speaker 1>the being is not just a particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a hell of a conclusion.</v>

79
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.780
<v Speaker 1>I would be very careful before I made it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are places it takes you </v>

80
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 1>that's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and then you might also ask yourself,</v>

81
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.590
<v Speaker 1>are you so sure that you're asking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question just because you're a good </v>

82
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.161
<v Speaker 1>person or you may be asking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question because you don't want the </v>

83
00:05:02.161 --> 00:05:05.531
<v Speaker 1>response to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of having a child in his finger and </v>

84
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:08.721
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you're afraid that you won't </v>

85
00:05:08.721 --> 00:05:09.460
<v Speaker 1>know how to fortify the child property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're withdrawing the fair.</v>

86
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look what do you do with children </v>

87
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 1>because you encouraged them and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>that literally.</v>

88
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have a little kid and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

89
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:25.291
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take on the world and you don't </v>

90
00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:27.841
<v Speaker 1>sugarcoat it just like it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all fairy tales and roses.</v>

91
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neil is shield things enough so you </v>

92
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.561
<v Speaker 1>don't damage them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very tight balancing because you </v>

93
00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:40.411
<v Speaker 1>don't want to know what to overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone hurt them while you're teaching </v>

94
00:05:40.411 --> 00:05:44.311
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to expose him gradually and </v>

95
00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:44.311
<v Speaker 1>with intelligence and you do that by </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a relationship with the kid.</v>

96
00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:45.820
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to shield them from </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

97
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.880
<v Speaker 1>We want to show them just what it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you want to tell them it </v>

98
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.880
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

99
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.010
<v Speaker 1>you're tough enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it and you can do it right </v>

100
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>and it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can and if you see four to five and</v>

101
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:03.251
<v Speaker 1>with that knowledge they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're being is not characterized by </v>

102
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:08.471
<v Speaker 1>the kind of suffering that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence intolerable and so the answer </v>

103
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:09.950
<v Speaker 1>is not to have children.</v>

104
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.980
<v Speaker 1>The answer is cooperative and encourage </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and that's tough because you don't.</v>

105
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.410
<v Speaker 1>You're kind of fragmented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been broken,</v>

106
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 1>and if you treat your child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might exceed me.</v>

107
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.540
<v Speaker 1>That's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you may do everything you can to </v>

108
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.430
<v Speaker 1>bloody well made sure that your kid is </v>
<v Speaker 1>broken enough so there's no way they're </v>

109
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 1>going to do any better than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I wouldn't recommend that,</v>

110
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.140
<v Speaker 1>but people do it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that existence </v>

111
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.441
<v Speaker 1>itself is insufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just means that you're not handling </v>

112
00:06:41.441 --> 00:06:43.110
<v Speaker 1>the property and you're making it far </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse than it has to be.</v>

113
00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 1>In.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I asked myself a long </v>

114
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 1>time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

115
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.361
<v Speaker 1>I know there's a distinction between </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy and that's an important </v>

116
00:06:52.361 --> 00:06:55.781
<v Speaker 1>distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tragedy is when things happen that </v>

117
00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:57.410
<v Speaker 1>aren't good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone gets cancer.</v>

118
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.310
<v Speaker 1>You know your child slips and breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his or her labor.</v>

119
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Know your parents guide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's tragic.</v>

120
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Evil is when something tragic happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>because someone wanted it.</v>

121
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Tap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

122
00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:14.020
<v Speaker 1>so we can distinguish between ell </v>
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>

123
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.270
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I would say is people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can have a tragedy like you can get </v>

124
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.290
<v Speaker 1>tough enough so you can have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

125
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:26.291
<v Speaker 1>I think you can get tough enough so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you even get tougher if you're exposed </v>

126
00:07:26.291 --> 00:07:26.750
<v Speaker 1>to trash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sort of his statement about,</v>

127
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:27.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever doesn't kill me,</v>

128
00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:32.210
<v Speaker 1>makes me stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it's an overstatement.</v>

129
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:36.170
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard for people to tolerate </v>
<v Speaker 1>evil level ones.</v>

130
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.660
<v Speaker 1>So like I've seen people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

131
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.270
<v Speaker 1>is adolescent clients with posttraumatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress disorder.</v>

132
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Very often traumatized by malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not tragic.</v>

133
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 1>They fall victim to someone who wants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt and maybe it's even self that wants</v>

134
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:51.380
<v Speaker 1>to hurt them and that's revealed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

135
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes they come into their often</v>

136
00:07:54.261 --> 00:07:59.261
<v Speaker 1>naive people to come into contact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone whose purpose is to hurt them </v>

137
00:07:59.261 --> 00:08:01.700
<v Speaker 1>and that shadows so badly to kind of put</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves back together.</v>

138
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Evils really devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think human beings can tolerate </v>

139
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.361
<v Speaker 1>tragedy and I also think that if people </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented themselves towards the </v>

140
00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:15.971
<v Speaker 1>improvement of being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could continually ameliorate tragic </v>

141
00:08:15.971 --> 00:08:19.250
<v Speaker 1>and I do also believe that being is </v>
<v Speaker 1>striving to perfect itself.</v>

142
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Now that's obviously a metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>

143
00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 1>but I don't really care if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical metaphysical statement.</v>

144
00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:29.801
<v Speaker 1>I have my reasons for for bleeding and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that the purpose of human life is </v>

145
00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:35.960
<v Speaker 1>to participate in that process and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because again,</v>

146
00:08:35.961 --> 00:08:40.961
<v Speaker 1>the alternative is things are quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>lists and life is suffering and it </v>

147
00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:42.350
<v Speaker 1>should be eradicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that leads nowhere.</v>

148
00:08:42.351 --> 00:08:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Good really leads nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>

149
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 1>so I can dispense with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better than where it takes you.</v>

150
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like a bad roadmap because most </v>
<v Speaker 1>profound ideas,</v>

151
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
<v Speaker 1>our roadmap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tell you how to get from one point </v>

152
00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.891
<v Speaker 1>to another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to get to the depths of </v>

153
00:08:59.891 --> 00:09:03.111
<v Speaker 1>infertile chaos or do you want to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards something that approximates </v>

154
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:03.930
<v Speaker 1>paradise?</v>

155
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he better make sure you have the right </v>

156
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:09.530
<v Speaker 1>map and so and most belief systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our roadmaps,</v>

157
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.320
<v Speaker 1>they're descriptions of reality in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>description to objective reality there.</v>

158
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:18.280
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so have kids to say,</v>

159
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.360
<v Speaker 1>it's one third of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will bloody won't regret it if you </v>

160
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be forever or 30.</v>

161
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Some days you're going to be 50 or 55 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it will be alone.</v>

162
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.660
<v Speaker 1>That's not so good and so you're a fool </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have kids.</v>

163
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

164
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.680
<v Speaker 1>I know people have their reasons and </v>
<v Speaker 1>some people have appropriate reasons and</v>

165
00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:42.681
<v Speaker 1>all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's somebody ideological hangup </v>

166
00:09:42.681 --> 00:09:44.830
<v Speaker 1>that stopping you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you better dispense with that </v>

167
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:45.030
<v Speaker 1>instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of dispensing with the kids.</v>
