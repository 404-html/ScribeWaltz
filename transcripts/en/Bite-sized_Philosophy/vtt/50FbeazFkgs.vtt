1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the question is that the totalitarian</v>

2
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:08.010
<v Speaker 1>forms that we've seen primarily in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>past have been male and,</v>

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.260
<v Speaker 1>but maybe we're seeing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>different now.</v>

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.670
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's.</v>

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>It's out of the common kind that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>expanded in its dominion,</v>

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.170
<v Speaker 1>so you imagine that there's an essential</v>
<v Speaker 1>feminine pathology just as there is an </v>

7
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 1>essential masculine pathology and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential feminine pathology.</v>

8
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:33.081
<v Speaker 1>Freud mapped out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the eternal mother and the mother </v>

9
00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>is the mother that gets too close to her</v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

10
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and intermingles herself with them too,</v>

11
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 1>too great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A degree that in her attempts to protect</v>

12
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:46.401
<v Speaker 1>them undermines them fatally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a classic representation </v>

13
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:52.071
<v Speaker 1>of the feminine in the West and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>classic representation is married and </v>

14
00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one of the representations.</v>

15
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:58.191
<v Speaker 1>It's lovely and it's derived at least in</v>
<v Speaker 1>part from the story of Mary and the </v>

16
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:02.991
<v Speaker 1>snake in the garden of Eden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so Mary has her foot on a serpent </v>

17
00:01:02.991 --> 00:01:05.280
<v Speaker 1>and she's holding Christ off to the side</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

18
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what mothers have always </v>

19
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.501
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a biological portrait of human </v>

20
00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:15.651
<v Speaker 1>women is they hold their infants out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reach of the terrible Serpentine </v>

21
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that's what we do.</v>

22
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine,</v>

23
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.940
<v Speaker 1>but adults aren't infants and neither </v>
<v Speaker 1>are children and if you treat them like </v>

24
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you undermine them,</v>

25
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

26
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pathologize them,</v>

27
00:01:32.221 --> 00:01:37.221
<v Speaker 1>you turn them into old infants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an ugly thing and that's the </v>

28
00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Freudian nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

29
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.320
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this happens in therapy very </v>

30
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.701
<v Speaker 1>frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can be tangled into a </v>

31
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:48.771
<v Speaker 1>terrible relationship with your father </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's often either because he was </v>

32
00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:52.380
<v Speaker 1>absent or abusive or tyrannical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

33
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>but that standard pathology with mom is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she did everything for you.</v>

34
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's left for you to do nothing </v>

35
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.230
<v Speaker 1>including never leaving.</v>

36
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the motivation.</v>

37
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the woman who's nothing but </v>

38
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 1>protective mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no role outside of nurturing,</v>

39
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>of nurturing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nurturing,</v>

40
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.630
<v Speaker 1>of nurturance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of infants,</v>

41
00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>of nurture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of infants.</v>

42
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just keep them.</v>

43
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Infants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll never leave.</v>

44
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Am I kill you in night in your sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they'll never leave.</v>

45
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.260
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

46
00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:39.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so comical watching the feminist </v>

47
00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:42.260
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists in particular rattle on </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the absence of gender reality and </v>

48
00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:47.781
<v Speaker 1>act out the archetipal devouring mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>at exactly the same time for them,</v>

49
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.370
<v Speaker 1>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world is divided into predators and </v>

50
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.001
<v Speaker 1>infants and the predators are evil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be stopped and the infants need </v>

51
00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>to be cared for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

52
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>that's what the mother does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but adults are not infants</v>

53
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.430
<v Speaker 1>and all you do is destroy them when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>treat them that way,</v>

54
00:03:10.431 --> 00:03:13.130
<v Speaker 1>especially when they're adolescents and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just starting to develop.</v>

55
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Now there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a rule that I attempted to abide</v>

56
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 1>by when I had small children and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule was don't do anything for your </v>

57
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.750
<v Speaker 1>children that they can do themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's annoying that rule because it takes</v>

58
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.770
<v Speaker 1>you like 15 seconds to to dress a two </v>
<v Speaker 1>year old,</v>

59
00:03:30.771 --> 00:03:32.690
<v Speaker 1>but you'll let that two year old dress </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

60
00:03:32.691 --> 00:03:37.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like 15 minutes or 20 minutes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>half an hour.</v>

61
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 1>You chase them around the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you let them learn to dress </v>

62
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.521
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have to dress themselves </v>

63
00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:45.521
<v Speaker 1>any direct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dress them anymore and they can do it,</v>

64
00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:47.570
<v Speaker 1>and you do that with setting the table </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you do that with everything.</v>

65
00:03:47.571 --> 00:03:48.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

66
00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:53.291
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do that now while I care for you so </v>

67
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:53.291
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me do that for you.</v>

68
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:57.041
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care for you at all when I say </v>

69
00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:58.691
<v Speaker 1>that I don't care for you at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stop doing everything I </v>

70
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:00.920
<v Speaker 1>possibly can for you as rapidly as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly can say,</v>

71
00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:01.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

72
00:04:01.581 --> 00:04:03.140
<v Speaker 1>That's how you work in an old age home.</v>

73
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.940
<v Speaker 1>Do not do anything for the inhabitants </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can do themselves because you </v>

74
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.210
<v Speaker 1>robbed them of the last vestiges of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their independence.</v>

75
00:04:11.211 --> 00:04:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what you do when you're a manager.</v>

76
00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:18.131
<v Speaker 1>If you're a good manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make yourself superfluous by </v>

77
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>extending autonomy and independence to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that you manage so that they </v>

78
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.871
<v Speaker 1>can take over the whole job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't do that by doing everything </v>

79
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:29.471
<v Speaker 1>for people and you certainly don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that by dividing the world </v>

80
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:31.460
<v Speaker 1>architecturally and uncritically into </v>
<v Speaker 1>predators.</v>

81
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Those who have more and victims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infants,</v>

82
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.200
<v Speaker 1>those who have nothing and acting like </v>
<v Speaker 1>all you can ever do is protect them.</v>

83
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.760
<v Speaker 1>You don't protect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

84
00:04:40.761 --> 00:04:43.160
<v Speaker 1>you can't protect people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only make them strong.</v>

85
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.500
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot protect them.</v>

86
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.740
<v Speaker 1>You can make them strong and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can predict themselves,</v>

87
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.620
<v Speaker 1>but then they don't need you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

88
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.920
<v Speaker 1>and there's the underground pathological</v>
<v Speaker 1>element of the devouring mother.</v>

89
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.120
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never leave me.</v>

90
00:04:56.121 --> 00:04:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do everything for you.</v>

91
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.220
<v Speaker 1>You just never leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

92
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.950
<v Speaker 1>That's sleeping with your mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

93
00:05:03.951 --> 00:05:05.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the Friday a nightmare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

94
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't invite your child into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed,</v>

95
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.220
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You distinguished between them and you.</v>

96
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.250
<v Speaker 1>You distinguish between them and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>husband and you facilitate their </v>

97
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.321
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A part of the reason why it's useful to </v>

98
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:23.561
<v Speaker 1>have a mother and a father is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mother has to fall insanely in love </v>

99
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:24.410
<v Speaker 1>with the infant or she'd throw it out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the window,</v>

100
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're.</v>

101
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.370
<v Speaker 1>They're insanely demanding and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>always right.</v>

102
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the right way to treat an </v>

103
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>infant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially before nine months,</v>

104
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.120
<v Speaker 1>is I'll do everything for you and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>always right in your needs.</v>

105
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Take priority over everyone's one else's</v>
<v Speaker 1>and anybody that threatens you is </v>

106
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.370
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right,</v>

107
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.300
<v Speaker 1>but after once the kid is ambulatory and</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to be independent,</v>

108
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.530
<v Speaker 1>that's the wrong attitude.</v>

109
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.130
<v Speaker 1>The attitude then is no get the hell on </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

110
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 1>And men who are less prone to negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion and less compassionate are much </v>

111
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>better at fostering kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>

112
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.460
<v Speaker 1>And so it's usually then when they step </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the family and start playing with </v>

113
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 1>the kids rough and tumble play and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing them forward and saying,</v>

114
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:07.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get on with it.</v>

115
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 1>You can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it at home.</v>

116
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.700
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard for a mother to play both</v>
<v Speaker 1>those rules because she has to fall so </v>

117
