1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.990
<v Speaker 1>How much trouble would you want there </v>
<v Speaker 1>not to be?</v>

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Because you want to have something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>contend with.</v>

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>You want to have something that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces from you the best that you have,</v>

5
00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:15.360
<v Speaker 1>and so you have to have real problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Would you dispense with all your real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could just lay down on a bed and </v>

7
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.931
<v Speaker 1>have pablum infused into your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know if all your problems were </v>

8
00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>solved and so maybe you want difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that you can solve.</v>

9
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Something like that because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>some.</v>

10
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's A.</v>

11
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>There's the overcoming and the and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth that comes along with that.</v>

12
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>There's something about the nobility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the enterprise.</v>

13
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:38.760
<v Speaker 1>You certainly see that when you go about</v>
<v Speaker 1>having children,</v>

14
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

15
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychological literature is quite </v>

16
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.541
<v Speaker 1>clear if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do moment to moment comparisons </v>

17
00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:47.541
<v Speaker 1>of people who have kids and people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have kids,</v>

18
00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:52.140
<v Speaker 1>the people who don't have kids are </v>
<v Speaker 1>happier and so psychologists who tend to</v>

19
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:57.141
<v Speaker 1>get things wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when they make intelligent </v>

20
00:00:57.141 --> 00:00:59.300
<v Speaker 1>discoveries like that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately some of them jumped to the </v>

21
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.020
<v Speaker 1>conclusion that because happiness is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>

22
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:06.021
<v Speaker 1>that while there's something about </v>
<v Speaker 1>children that make you unhappy and </v>

23
00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:06.021
<v Speaker 1>that's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

24
00:01:06.021 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second,</v>

25
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that's the wrong metric.</v>

26
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you're less happy once you </v>

27
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.790
<v Speaker 1>have children because you have to worry </v>
<v Speaker 1>about them.</v>

28
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my neighbor down the street who's very </v>

29
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.841
<v Speaker 1>smart woman said to me once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only be as happy as your </v>

30
00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 1>unhappiest child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was really good.</v>

31
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really smart,</v>

32
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.140
<v Speaker 1>but then it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

33
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 1>it's having children doesn't make you </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>

34
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:28.470
<v Speaker 1>The answer isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have children.</v>

35
00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be so stupid about being happy.</v>

36
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:35.721
<v Speaker 1>That's the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because there's a nobility in the </v>

37
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:35.721
<v Speaker 1>pursuit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

38
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 1>And of course now you're responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you have a new baby.</v>

39
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 1>You think especially if you're a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>parent,</v>

40
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:44.181
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is this and what am I </v>

41
00:01:44.181 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 1>gonna do with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

42
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:46.330
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're,</v>

43
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.500
<v Speaker 1>you're done for the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never sleep properly again because </v>

44
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.551
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be worried about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>creature that you have to take care of </v>

45
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:55.551
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

46
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>what the hell good are you?</v>

47
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>If you're not doing that or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>else equally difficult because you just,</v>

48
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>you just have been called out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you take on a responsibility like</v>

49
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:09.651
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that life is that happiness is </v>

50
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like great for happiness,</v>

51
00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it comes along,</v>

52
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 1>you should be thrilled that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>visiting you,</v>

53
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.610
<v Speaker 1>but the notion that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's what you should pursue.</v>

54
00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:20.520
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the weakest possible notion.</v>

55
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as something terrible happens to</v>

56
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

57
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like life is to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

58
00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you have cancer,</v>

59
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>so how's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's the happiness thing?</v>

60
00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Work it out for you now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it's not you.</v>

61
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:39.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's your father that has </v>

62
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:40.971
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's disease or some damn thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know it's like it's a rare </v>

63
00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 1>person that doesn't have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>

64
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one person away from them.</v>

65
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like life is to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that's not right,</v>

66
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.370
<v Speaker 1>and we can at least derive that from </v>
<v Speaker 1>these stories.</v>

67
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:55.371
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what they say at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's perfectly happy in the stories to </v>

68
00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:58.290
<v Speaker 1>grant the people with whom he forms a </v>
<v Speaker 1>covenant happiness and prosperity,</v>

69
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>but there's never a word that that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>

70
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>The rule is aim high and get your bloody</v>
<v Speaker 1>act together.</v>

71
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the rule and establish this </v>
<v Speaker 1>contractual covenant with the ultimate </v>

72
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.811
<v Speaker 1>ideal and that will see you through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes and that's a much more </v>

73
00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>mature way of looking at life as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned because all you have to do</v>

74
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:20.611
<v Speaker 1>is have your eyes half open and you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the fundamental reality of life is </v>

75
00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>tragedy and suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that's inescapable.</v>

76
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>The quest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean that it.</v>

77
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.450
<v Speaker 1>It makes life unbearable or that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes being something that shouldn't </v>

78
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>have existed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

79
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.720
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it means that you have to contend </v>

80
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.781
<v Speaker 1>with it and you have to get ready and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the willingness to adopt responsibility </v>

81
00:03:39.781 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>for yourself and for others is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the precondition for that.</v>

82
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:47.251
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe if you do that properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then now and then you get some </v>

83
00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:47.251
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

84
00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:51.331
<v Speaker 1>you can sit at the end of the day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have half an hour where your </v>

85
00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:54.211
<v Speaker 1>conscience is clear and there's nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you need to be doing and you can </v>

86
00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:54.211
<v Speaker 1>relax and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 1>that that's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things are okay and thank God for that.</v>

88
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's maybe where you get your </v>

89
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's something that's growing up,</v>

90
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:05.470
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

91
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.760
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to not know that and to not be </v>

92
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.760
<v Speaker 1>taught that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everyone should be taught that it's</v>

93
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 1>so obvious.</v>
