00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.160
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about the issue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination in relationship to sex </v>

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.220
<v Speaker 1>because I've been thinking a lot about </v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination lately because everybody </v>

3
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.071
<v Speaker 1>thinks discrimination is a bad idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very stupid proposition </v>

4
00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:16.791
<v Speaker 1>because you're discriminating all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and the most fundamental form of </v>

5
00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>discrimination is choice of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner.</v>

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why should that even be allowed?</v>

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Because it is the most fundamental form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of discrimination.</v>

8
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:29.511
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everyone is racially prejudice </v>

9
00:00:29.511 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to sexual partners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>

10
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:31.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

11
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.060
<v Speaker 1>what about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>are you do use age as an exclusionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>criteria?</v>

14
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Probably do use physical attractiveness </v>
<v Speaker 1>only in so far as you're able,</v>

15
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You use it completely.</v>

16
00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:45.870
<v Speaker 1>If you could get away with it roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

17
00:00:45.871 --> 00:00:50.871
<v Speaker 1>but you can't because the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive people aren't going to be </v>

18
00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:50.871
<v Speaker 1>anywhere near you.</v>

19
00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>So you can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you'd like to.</v>

20
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>Health yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strength.</v>

21
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wealth,</v>

22
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Education,</v>

23
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.020
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's unbelievably discriminatory.</v>

24
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why is that justifiable?</v>

25
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that it's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

26
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to say no to me if I get to say </v>

27
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.550
<v Speaker 1>no to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

28
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.930
<v Speaker 1>We've agreed that everybody gets to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discriminate on that basis and because </v>

29
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>everybody can do it then it's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

30
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 1>It's very much we're thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:29.091
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Huxley's brave new world where </v>

32
00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:32.781
<v Speaker 1>the family had been completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>demolished rate and children were </v>

33
00:01:32.781 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>conceived in bottles and given an </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced in factories.</v>

34
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>So the whole idea of the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between sex and procreation had become a</v>

35
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>taboo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the Mantras,</v>

36
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:48.570
<v Speaker 1>the slogans of the society was everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>belongs to everyone else.</v>

37
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.140
<v Speaker 1>And so it was actually a social full </v>
<v Speaker 1>pause to refuse to sleep with someone </v>

38
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 1>just as it was a social for Paul to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>any exclusionary relationship.</v>

39
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Because another thing that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>notice is that there's nothing more </v>

40
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>discriminatory than falling in love with</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

41
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're special and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of you know.</v>

42
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>So it's the ultimate exclusionary act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

43
00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 1>And yet we presume that that's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable,</v>

44
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>not only acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We demand that as a,</v>

45
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>as a right and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where thinking about a lot.</v>
