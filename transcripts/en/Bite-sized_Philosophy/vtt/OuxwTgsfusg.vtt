1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.910
<v Speaker 1>The two on the left are Jonah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonah,</v>

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.910
<v Speaker 1>and the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the story of Jonah is an interesting </v>

3
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.910
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll just go over it very briefly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a city and the city is full of </v>

5
00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:17.420
<v Speaker 1>people who are sinful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

6
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sin is an archery term.</v>

7
00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:24.431
<v Speaker 1>It means to miss the mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are people who aren't oriented </v>

8
00:00:24.431 --> 00:00:27.131
<v Speaker 1>properly and so the city is in a chaotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>state and God tells Jonah that he's </v>

9
00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:29.900
<v Speaker 1>going to go to that city and tell them </v>
<v Speaker 1>just exactly what's up with them.</v>

10
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:30.620
<v Speaker 1>And Joanie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>

11
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that.</v>

12
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:34.520
<v Speaker 1>And why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.180
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't require much explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how popular you are going to </v>

14
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.211
<v Speaker 1>be if you go to a city full of chaotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and tell them why they're stupid </v>

15
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:44.930
<v Speaker 1>did wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Joanna.</v>

16
00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

17
00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:50.501
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if God's telling me to do </v>

18
00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:50.501
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

19
00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:53.320
<v Speaker 1>So his conscience is telling him to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it or his destiny is telling them to do </v>

20
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.651
<v Speaker 1>it or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or his orientation with higher morality </v>

21
00:00:56.651 --> 00:00:57.470
<v Speaker 1>is telling them to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can read it any way you want,</v>

22
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>and so he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

23
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm harping on this boat and I'm getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far away from that city as I possibly</v>

24
00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:06.881
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he does that and then the storm </v>

25
00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:06.920
<v Speaker 1>comes up because God thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

26
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:09.380
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I told you to do something,</v>

27
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:11.870
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A storm comes up.</v>

28
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

29
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy.</v>

30
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Betray your destiny and see how long it </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes you to be.</v>

31
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Drowning in a storm</v>

32
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>will happen immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course it will,</v>

33
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:33.641
<v Speaker 1>because what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's calling you to be your best is </v>

34
00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:34.340
<v Speaker 1>exactly the thing that's pushing you </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

35
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:36.770
<v Speaker 1>to manifest yourself most fully in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

36
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.080
<v Speaker 1>It's what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You run away from that.</v>

37
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.500
<v Speaker 1>The boat's going to start to rock very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly.</v>

38
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.320
<v Speaker 1>When you all know that you know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly well,</v>

39
00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

40
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.710
<v Speaker 1>it's hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is not study for an </v>

41
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.950
<v Speaker 1>exam that you know that's coming up to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see everything.</v>

42
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Start to the storm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Water start to rise and everything start</v>

43
00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:57.260
<v Speaker 1>to rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bloody obvious.</v>

44
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.380
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on this boat and there's a storm </v>

45
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.410
<v Speaker 1>and all of the people on the boat who </v>
<v Speaker 1>who can't quite discriminate chaos from </v>

46
00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:09.530
<v Speaker 1>whether because they haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiated the world to that degree,</v>

47
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:14.531
<v Speaker 1>thank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh the boat wouldn't be about to be </v>

48
00:02:14.531 --> 00:02:14.531
<v Speaker 1>swamped if we hadn't.</v>

49
00:02:14.531 --> 00:02:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Some of us had done something stupid and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong and there's logic in that,</v>

50
00:02:18.891 --> 00:02:19.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

51
00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:22.940
<v Speaker 1>well God has nothing personal against </v>
<v Speaker 1>you because of the storm,</v>

52
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:26.600
<v Speaker 1>so you're confusing levels of analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to give these people some</v>

53
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:31.601
<v Speaker 1>credit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like maybe they didn't do something </v>

54
00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:33.911
<v Speaker 1>stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they didn't caulk the damn boat </v>

55
00:02:33.911 --> 00:02:36.251
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the ropes aren't in as good as </v>

56
00:02:36.251 --> 00:02:38.711
<v Speaker 1>shape as they might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they weren't paying attention to </v>

57
00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:38.711
<v Speaker 1>the weather when they went out on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean,</v>

58
00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:43.390
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe they haven't made peace with </v>

59
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.390
<v Speaker 1>their brother and so their hearts are </v>
<v Speaker 1>bent,</v>

60
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.830
<v Speaker 1>twisted out of shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they don't make particularly good </v>

61
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.441
<v Speaker 1>sailors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the idea that you encounter a </v>

62
00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:51.020
<v Speaker 1>storm because you're stupid and wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it really good idea?</v>

63
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.680
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's not an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 1>applicability anyways,</v>

64
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:57.830
<v Speaker 1>they draw lots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a primitive thing to do.</v>

65
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

66
00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>it's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's someone's fault.</v>

67
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>We don't know who we're going to throw </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone overboard.</v>

68
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 1>The worst sinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that's what God wants.</v>

69
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:11.251
<v Speaker 1>Some kind of sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they all draw lots and someone loses </v>

70
00:03:11.251 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 1>and then Jonah stands up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

71
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 1>sorry guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I know that I've got a problem with</v>

72
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:19.051
<v Speaker 1>God at the moment so it's probably me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You better throw me over and they don't </v>

73
00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 1>really want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he finally convinces them over.</v>

74
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that storm settles.</v>

75
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>sometimes if you're in a group of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an organization,</v>

77
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:35.821
<v Speaker 1>there is someone in the organization </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's head is screwed on exactly </v>

78
00:03:35.821 --> 00:03:39.621
<v Speaker 1>straight and they know exactly why it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they've done wrong and what </v>

79
00:03:39.621 --> 00:03:43.471
<v Speaker 1>puts them in that position and they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>poisoning the entire enterprise and if </v>

80
00:03:43.471 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>you throw them overboard or better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they agreed voluntarily to leave,</v>

81
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 1>then this storm will abate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything will be okay.</v>

82
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.230
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they throw joe job over or Jonah </v>

83
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.811
<v Speaker 1>overboard and a whale comes up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>swallows them and take them down to the </v>

84
00:03:57.811 --> 00:03:57.811
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

85
00:03:57.811 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 1>we already know what that means because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we watched Pinocchio.</v>

86
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:04.291
<v Speaker 1>It's like when God abandons you because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've abandoned your destiny and the </v>

87
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:10.111
<v Speaker 1>storms come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to be </v>

88
00:04:10.111 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>taken down to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the depths is extraordinarily high,</v>

89
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:13.840
<v Speaker 1>and that happens in people's lives all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

90
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Also down there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonah repents.</v>

91
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do when you were in the </v>

92
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.720
<v Speaker 1>underworld?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you've been there before,</v>

93
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.680
<v Speaker 1>when things fall apart on your friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>have abandoned you.</v>

94
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.690
<v Speaker 1>You're not as popular as you could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't stand to look at yourself in </v>

95
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.820
<v Speaker 1>the mirror into the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go and you think,</v>

96
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done a lot of things wrong.</v>

97
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should reconcile myself with the</v>

98
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 1>world that I could get out of this wall.</v>

99
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.740
<v Speaker 1>So that's what Jonah does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks,</v>

100
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:37.660
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got this destiny.</v>

101
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I better go do what God says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the whale spit some out onto the </v>

102
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 1>beach and off he goes to the city to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell them what's wrong.</v>

103
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what that represents.</v>

104
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 1>That's these symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

105
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 1>it's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This second one,</v>

106
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really like.</v>

107
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:58.081
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting because you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jonah and reemerging from the whale and </v>

108
00:04:58.081 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 1>he's got a halo around his head and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

109
00:04:58.661 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's a halo?</v>

110
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever looked at a quarter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

111
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:08.011
<v Speaker 1>think about a quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A quarter is the moon and who's on the </v>

112
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 1>quarter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Queen,</v>

113
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>the queen is surrounded by the halo of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Moon,</v>

114
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.730
<v Speaker 1>the Queens Queen of the Queen of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>night gold coin.</v>

115
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 1>That's the king's head on the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the halo.</v>

116
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what comes out of the belly of the fish?</v>

117
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>It's the illuminated human being.</v>

118
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>It's the spirit of the illuminated human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

119
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.890
<v Speaker 1>That's what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

120
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:30.880
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

121
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>what else would come out of chaos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

122
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:37.711
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you fall apart and then you put </v>

123
00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:37.711
<v Speaker 1>yourself back together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that comes back out?</v>

124
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.930
<v Speaker 1>At least you're in better shape than you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were before,</v>

125
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe you do that 20 times in </v>

126
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.330
<v Speaker 1>your life or 50 times and you do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily.</v>

127
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Every time you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more like the thing with the halo</v>

128
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.220
<v Speaker 1>and less like the thing that's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown overboard by your friends.</v>
