1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now I have played with kids that </v>

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.341
<v Speaker 1>haven't had any rough and tumble play </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's really hard to play with them </v>

3
00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:10.020
<v Speaker 1>partly because they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're easily frightened,</v>

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd like to play.</v>

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I know how to play with kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd like to play.</v>

6
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty hepped up on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:17.160
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really excited,</v>

8
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>especially about physical plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're awkward,</v>

9
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you play with them,</v>

10
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:24.180
<v Speaker 1>they stick their thumb in your eye or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:29.181
<v Speaker 1>or they cry really easily with nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>really happens and like they just don't </v>

12
00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:33.891
<v Speaker 1>have it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A kid that has done a lot of physical </v>

13
00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:34.830
<v Speaker 1>interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical plane,</v>

14
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>that kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different sort of kid because the</v>

15
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>first thing the kid knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a rule.</v>

16
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.470
<v Speaker 1>The first thing the kid knows is how </v>
<v Speaker 1>forceful can he be with you so that it's</v>

17
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:51.000
<v Speaker 1>exciting and interesting and fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not too much.</v>

18
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>And that's really an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>question because actually to really play</v>

19
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 1>a good game like a physical contact </v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

20
00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:02.931
<v Speaker 1>like wrestling with a kid is that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to let that kid come right up to </v>

21
00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 1>the edge of hurting you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the closer the kid gets to the edge,</v>

22
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:11.061
<v Speaker 1>the more fun it is for both because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid will give you a whack and who you </v>

23
00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>know and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good,</v>

24
00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:17.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe he'll give you a harder </v>

25
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:17.241
<v Speaker 1>whack to see if he can get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids will often,</v>

26
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:21.050
<v Speaker 1>they'll come up to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whack you and then run away and then </v>

27
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.871
<v Speaker 1>they'll look and if you're laughing then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll come back and try a harder one </v>

28
00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:26.841
<v Speaker 1>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it incrementally because </v>

29
00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>it's exploratory behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the exploration is okay,</v>

30
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.700
<v Speaker 1>what our bodies like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answered that is,</v>

31
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can you get away with doing to </v>

32
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.120
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

33
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.210
<v Speaker 1>But it's a more sophisticated answer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what can you get away with </v>

34
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.041
<v Speaker 1>doing to them in a way that allows you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to continue to explore without fear or </v>

35
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:51.561
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And without blowing the whole game to </v>

36
00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:51.561
<v Speaker 1>bits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

37
00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:54.771
<v Speaker 1>so how do you figure that out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do not talk about it because you </v>

38
00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:55.560
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to act it out.</v>

39
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the kids hitting you in wrestling and</v>

40
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.920
<v Speaker 1>pulling your hair and doing all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and you're modifying its behavior</v>

41
00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:03.170
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very carefully and,</v>

42
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.730
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and minuscule detail.</v>

43
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 1>And then you get a kid who can wrestle </v>
<v Speaker 1>like mad and they're fun to play with.</v>

44
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>They bounce around like a dog that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>bite you.</v>

45
00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:16.251
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good well trained dog you can really </v>

46
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:16.251
<v Speaker 1>play with and you can play with them </v>
<v Speaker 1>rough.</v>

47
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:18.120
<v Speaker 1>And it's a blast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dog has a good time.</v>

48
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.460
<v Speaker 1>That person has a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like excellent.</v>

49
00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:25.461
<v Speaker 1>That's a socialized dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the other thing that kids learn </v>

50
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>learns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite cool,</v>

51
00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:32.211
<v Speaker 1>is what hurts them and what doesn't and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how afraid can they be and still have </v>

52
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:34.860
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

53
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>when you're wrestling with a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've put them,</v>

54
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put them face down,</v>

55
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>you put your elbow on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bend them around,</v>

56
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:42.870
<v Speaker 1>you throw them in the air and catch </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

57
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've grabbed him by the leg and maybe </v>

58
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.761
<v Speaker 1>you pull them over and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what you're showing the kid is </v>

59
00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 1>here's a bunch of things that your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do and it's okay that they're,</v>

60
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>they're being done that isn't going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt you and you're not talking about,</v>

61
00:02:56.461 --> 00:03:01.461
<v Speaker 1>you're showing them and so the kid gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of about what he or she can </v>

62
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:07.681
<v Speaker 1>withstand physically and the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between pain and not paying and the </v>

63
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:13.021
<v Speaker 1>difference between fear and not fear and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when something is threatening and when </v>

64
00:03:13.021 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

65
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.140
<v Speaker 1>It's very sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very sophisticated behavior and </v>

66
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>that's partly why kids love to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

67
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:22.070
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you know,</v>

68
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.120
<v Speaker 1>an indication of a deep sickness in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>society is that I used to work in a </v>

69
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.621
<v Speaker 1>daycare center right when I was about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your age because I really like kids and </v>

70
00:03:31.621 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 1>they like to play with me because I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to play with them.</v>

71
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:38.521
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I would do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little kids was I would draw them </v>

72
00:03:38.521 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>horrible monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

73
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Like big teeth things on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just sketched them out.</v>

74
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 1>They weren't any works of art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 1>but those damn kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would line up to get a picture of a</v>

76
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 1>monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>draw me a picture of the monster,</v>

77
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:52.891
<v Speaker 1>drop me a picture of a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they love those little </v>

78
00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>pictures of monsters so that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty funny.</v>

79
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 1>And other thing I would do is play with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

80
00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.260
<v Speaker 1>I'd take them out in the yard and grab </v>
<v Speaker 1>an arm and a leg and spin them around </v>

81
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 1>and bend them over and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 1>twist them around and let them crawl on </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

83
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:06.630
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always one kid in the group that</v>

84
00:04:06.631 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

85
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.480
<v Speaker 1>he hadn't been paid attention to enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

86
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:15.481
<v Speaker 1>So he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like a Taoist uncarved </v>

87
00:04:15.481 --> 00:04:18.240
<v Speaker 1>block,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very vague and ill defined and clunky </v>

88
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.540
<v Speaker 1>and so kid like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.660
<v Speaker 1>you'd sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so sad you sit down and you're </v>

90
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.810
<v Speaker 1>interacting with the kids and that kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes along sort of lumping along,</v>

91
00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:29.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this and they plop plop on your lap</v>

92
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>and they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're about as sophisticated as like a</v>

93
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>six month old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

94
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 1>And they're quite annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.470
<v Speaker 1>which is a horrible thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so desperate for attention and </v>

96
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 1>it's too late often by the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore it's like,</v>

97
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.910
<v Speaker 1>good luck fixing that man.</v>

98
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>and those kids are just screwed because </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens to them is they're so lumpy</v>

100
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:53.791
<v Speaker 1>and ill formed and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uncomfortable in their body and </v>

101
00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:56.941
<v Speaker 1>socially clueless and inattentive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>blind and ignored and resentful that no </v>

102
00:04:57.611 --> 00:05:02.611
<v Speaker 1>other kids will play with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's no wonder because there are </v>

103
00:05:02.611 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 1>other kids are way the hell up on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>play development trend.</v>

104
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.420
<v Speaker 1>And so their board staff by them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like playing with a nine month old,</v>

105
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which kids will do,</v>

106
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not pure play.</v>

107
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.120
<v Speaker 1>And so those kids just drift off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get,</v>

108
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 1>they stay on the outside of the peer </v>
<v Speaker 1>group and they never get into it.</v>

109
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.270
<v Speaker 1>They never get into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So very,</v>

110
00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:27.271
<v Speaker 1>very ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now in daycare centers you can't </v>

111
00:05:27.271 --> 00:05:29.200
<v Speaker 1>touch the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the hell,</v>

112
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.370
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well why?</v>

113
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he can't distinguish play for </v>

114
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.400
<v Speaker 1>molesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like who can't distinguish that,</v>

115
