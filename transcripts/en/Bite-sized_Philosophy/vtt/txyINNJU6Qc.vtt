1
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Couple of questions about dialogue and </v>
<v Speaker 1>engaging in dialogue with people.</v>

2
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:10.281
<v Speaker 1>So the first issue that I faced is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a very high need for intellectual</v>

3
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>stimulation and I can't get that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>most people.</v>

4
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>It's something like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have a dialogue for a time,</v>

5
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:19.630
<v Speaker 1>but then it</v>

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.500
<v Speaker 2>titrate openness</v>

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.170
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>

8
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.300
<v Speaker 1>But then they started running out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas they can keep up and it sort of </v>

9
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>falls apart and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a problem that intellectuals </v>

10
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.150
<v Speaker 1>have quite frequently is that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sort of,</v>

11
00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:36.520
<v Speaker 1>once they started getting difficult and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rewarding stuff,</v>

12
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>they stop wanting to talk to regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and I think that contributes to </v>

13
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.651
<v Speaker 1>the disconnect that you see between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals and working class people </v>

14
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:49.000
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other question I had was about,</v>

15
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.580
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

16
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe there's a question in there.</v>

17
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>The question is how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

18
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 1>how should we address that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How should I address it?</v>

19
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that something that can be dressed?</v>

20
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of,</v>

21
00:01:02.351 --> 00:01:05.170
<v Speaker 2>part of the answer to that is that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the universities were for.</v>

22
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

23
00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:11.491
<v Speaker 2>not everybody is equipped to or </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in engaging in high level </v>

24
00:01:11.951 --> 00:01:14.080
<v Speaker 2>discussion of abstract and creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

25
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear this idea that everyone's </v>

26
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 2>creative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lie.</v>

27
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.500
<v Speaker 2>It's a straightforward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that true?</v>

28
00:01:20.501 --> 00:01:23.650
<v Speaker 2>Creativity is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very rare and so,</v>

29
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 2>and if you happen to be a creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>person or if you happen to be someone </v>

30
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.750
<v Speaker 2>who's profoundly interested in ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are in a pronounced minority just as</v>

31
00:01:31.751 --> 00:01:36.751
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you happen to be extremely </v>

32
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:36.751
<v Speaker 2>extroverted or extremely agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are extremely conscientious.</v>

33
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.470
<v Speaker 2>These are minority issues and what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>do is you find likeminded people who are</v>

34
00:01:41.471 --> 00:01:46.471
<v Speaker 2>capable of engaging that we know a </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight heavyweight weightlifters </v>

35
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 2>compete with heavyweight weightlifters </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a reason and everyone thinks that's </v>

36
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.490
<v Speaker 2>fine and the same thing applies to </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual and creative endeavors.</v>

37
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.260
<v Speaker 2>So what you do is you try to find a </v>
<v Speaker 2>community where that's,</v>

38
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.580
<v Speaker 2>that's the nature of the community and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you likely have to find a relationship </v>

39
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.710
<v Speaker 2>like that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think so.</v>

40
00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:13.711
<v Speaker 2>I think what contributes to the siloing </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the arrogance that goes along with </v>

41
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:13.711
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're,</v>

42
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.680
<v Speaker 2>you can be interested in ideas and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be creative.</v>

43
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the arrogance of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellect,</v>

44
00:02:19.991 --> 00:02:21.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing the Catholic Church had</v>

45
00:02:21.671 --> 00:02:24.250
<v Speaker 2>warned about for centuries is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrogance of the intellect.</v>

46
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 2>So because if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're wise as well as smart and </v>

47
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.120
<v Speaker 2>there is no relationship between being </v>
<v Speaker 2>smart and being wise,</v>

48
00:02:31.121 --> 00:02:36.121
<v Speaker 2>they are not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no quick pathway from smart to </v>

49
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:39.841
<v Speaker 2>wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And many of the people who I've known </v>

50
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:42.631
<v Speaker 2>who were very wise were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them were intellectually </v>

51
00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:43.020
<v Speaker 2>impaired and we're still wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

52
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.270
<v Speaker 2>so it's the arrogance that brings up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>block.</v>

53
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.800
<v Speaker 2>And I see this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

54
00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:52.801
<v Speaker 2>happening in the United States in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular because the last time I went </v>

55
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:52.801
<v Speaker 2>down there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

56
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:57.151
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had friends down there and some of </v>

57
00:02:57.151 --> 00:02:59.821
<v Speaker 2>those friends are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very smart people and some of them were </v>

58
00:02:59.821 --> 00:03:02.941
<v Speaker 2>talking about the voters and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about the trump voters with </v>

59
00:03:02.941 --> 00:03:07.321
<v Speaker 2>contempt and I thought you better watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because that's 50 percent of the </v>

60
00:03:07.321 --> 00:03:12.031
<v Speaker 2>dam population and it might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>convenient to think that they're stupid </v>

61
00:03:12.031 --> 00:03:16.111
<v Speaker 2>and beneath you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not conducive to a civil state </v>

62
00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:19.680
<v Speaker 2>and there's no evidence that it's true </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there isn't a straight line </v>

63
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 2>between intelligent and wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that if your,</v>

64
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 2>if your character is developed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're intelligent,</v>

65
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 2>you can have your siloed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative community,</v>

66
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.250
<v Speaker 2>but you develop enough wisdom so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see all the things that people </v>

67
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.941
<v Speaker 2>can do that or have high ethical utility</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are outside the intellectual </v>

68
00:03:38.941 --> 00:03:38.941
<v Speaker 2>domain.</v>

69
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.330
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's why in the New </v>

70
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.680
<v Speaker 2>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why Christ is a </v>

71
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.680
<v Speaker 2>carpenter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

72
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.680
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

73
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carpenter is one of those jobs that when</v>

74
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:56.371
<v Speaker 2>you're dishonest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it manifests itself immediately because </v>

75
00:03:56.371 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 2>what you build falls down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so if you're an honest carpenter,</v>

76
00:03:57.161 --> 00:03:59.620
<v Speaker 2>you build a good house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a nice metaphor there,</v>

77
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:04.621
<v Speaker 2>but it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also a warning in some sense </v>

78
00:04:04.621 --> 00:04:08.880
<v Speaker 2>against the the equation of intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliance with moral superiority.</v>

79
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.620
<v Speaker 2>And so if the intellects would drop </v>
<v Speaker 2>their moral superiority and fat chance </v>

80
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.881
<v Speaker 2>there is of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that divide between the working </v>

81
00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:24.661
<v Speaker 2>class say and the elite would would </v>
<v Speaker 2>resolve.</v>

82
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.700
<v Speaker 2>And there's every reason to have respect</v>
<v Speaker 2>for decent working class people.</v>

83
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's on their labor as the left </v>
<v Speaker 2>wingers at least hypothetically agree </v>

84
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 2>that the entire edifice of the culture </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

85
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.890
<v Speaker 2>is resting so you can have your cake and</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat it too.</v>

86
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.890
<v Speaker 2>But you have to not assume that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>niche makes you superior.</v>

87
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 2>And it's very difficult for smart </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

88
00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 2>especially smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this scene in niches.</v>

89
00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Sins thus spake Zarathustra were zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Booster of the profit comes down from </v>

90
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.701
<v Speaker 2>the mountain and he comes into a public </v>
<v Speaker 2>square and there's this crowd around </v>

91
00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 2>this little midget who is only about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this high,</v>

92
00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:11.821
<v Speaker 2>who has a gigantic ear and everyone is </v>
<v Speaker 2>marveling at him.</v>

93
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what the modern intellect is </v>

94
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.460
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a midget with a giant.</v>

95
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.410
<v Speaker 2>Well mouth generally not an ear and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

96
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.470
<v Speaker 2>the being is underdeveloped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the intellect is hyper activated and</v>

97
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.910
<v Speaker 2>it makes the person extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbalanced and it's partly because a,</v>

98
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.050
<v Speaker 2>they can't compete outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual realm and that makes them </v>

99
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.050
<v Speaker 2>very bitter because they tend to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

100
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so smart.</v>

101
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Everything should just come to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

102
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not how the world works.</v>

103
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.050
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it also that,</v>

104
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.750
<v Speaker 2>that and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

105
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.410
<v Speaker 2>that attitude is immediately evident to </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that they're talking to when they</v>

106
00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:52.411
<v Speaker 2>talk in the manner that they talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they are arrogant intellectuals of </v>

107
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:55.471
<v Speaker 2>that sort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see that in the simpsons did a good </v>

108
00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:55.820
<v Speaker 2>job of that with Comic Book Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

109
00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he completely useless in every possible </v>

110
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Speaker 2>dimension with an Iq of about 160 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very annoying to people who have an</v>

111
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Iq of 160 that they can also be </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely useless,</v>

112
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.580
<v Speaker 2>but it happens a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

113
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>
