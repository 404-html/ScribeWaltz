1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.240
<v Speaker 1>And so they're off to pleasure island </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark place and uh,</v>

2
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.820
<v Speaker 1>the coachman opens the gates and lets </v>
<v Speaker 1>the delinquents into pleasure island and</v>

3
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.260
<v Speaker 1>they basically have a riot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is pleasure island here.</v>

4
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.160
<v Speaker 1>It's full of amusement park rides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

5
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about horror movies,</v>

6
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've noticed this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they're often sat at amusement </v>

7
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.170
<v Speaker 1>parks and clowns are often characters of</v>
<v Speaker 1>horror.</v>

8
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.110
<v Speaker 1>We'll leave the clowns aside for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the amusement park thing that's </v>

9
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.221
<v Speaker 1>pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like why in the world with an </v>

10
00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:43.221
<v Speaker 1>amusement park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

11
00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>a place of horror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first question might be,</v>

12
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever been to an amusement park?</v>

13
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Because there is something about them </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really.</v>

14
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 1>They have a dark side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear,</v>

15
00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:58.371
<v Speaker 1>dark side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of it is that people with </v>

16
00:00:58.371 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 1>nothing better to do or spending money </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupidly.</v>

17
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>And they're being fleeced by the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who operate the the amusement park,</v>

18
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have,</v>

19
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.260
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stereotypically dark reputation and </v>

20
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>they're moving around all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also something that psychopaths</v>

21
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:20.361
<v Speaker 1>do and all they're doing is moving from </v>
<v Speaker 1>community to community and taking the </v>

22
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>money from the rubes fundamentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the amusement park,</v>

23
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 1>well if you walk through an amusement </v>
<v Speaker 1>park without sort of thing in mind,</v>

24
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.270
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's also coloring your vision </v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

25
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's something that you could see </v>
<v Speaker 1>very immediately.</v>

26
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>So there's something about them that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of deeply sad,</v>

27
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:43.311
<v Speaker 1>but there's also that under,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an underlying horror that </v>

28
00:01:43.311 --> 00:01:45.711
<v Speaker 1>characterizes them that it's easy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>horror movie or horror novel writers to </v>

29
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>immediately expand upon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's something about it that,</v>

30
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.150
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's too easy.</v>

31
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:59.151
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also all short term </v>

32
00:01:59.151 --> 00:01:59.151
<v Speaker 1>gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>

33
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>So you spend your money very rapidly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gone.</v>

34
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

35
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

36
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:12.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the impulsive element that the </v>

37
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:12.951
<v Speaker 1>comment was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a celebration of,</v>

38
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 1>of meanings divorced from reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:14.250
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

40
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>it's also outside of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

41
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:20.991
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's on an island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a separate universe and it's a </v>

42
00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:25.251
<v Speaker 1>universe where nothing that's happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>is connected to anything outside and </v>

43
00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>you're spending your hard earned money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

44
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly not an investment.</v>

45
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not that much different than </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning it what is because of course you</v>

46
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:35.160
<v Speaker 1>get some pleasure out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

47
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.940
<v Speaker 1>But it isn't going with their everyday </v>
<v Speaker 1>is probably not the wisest move that you</v>

48
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:46.311
<v Speaker 1>could make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the animators do a good job of,</v>

49
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Speaker 1>of while I'm presenting the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>

50
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.360
<v Speaker 1>the in hedonism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I would say of a place like </v>

51
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.151
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a place where you're going to </v>

52
00:03:02.151 --> 00:03:02.151
<v Speaker 1>have fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's for.</v>
