1
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.860
<v Speaker 1>I guess they call themselves in cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>involuntary celibates when all this </v>

2
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.760
<v Speaker 1>stuff went down with his car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drove his car into a group of people.</v>

3
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:13.761
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the things that you talked </v>

4
00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>about within cells is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was a part of the role,</v>

5
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.760
<v Speaker 1>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The News in New York Times piece you,</v>

6
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>you said one of the cures for this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforced monogamy.</v>

7
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>People decided and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had never heard that term before quite</v>

8
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

9
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck does that mean?</v>

10
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.250
<v Speaker 1>It's a psychological term and what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means is enforced by culture that it is </v>

11
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:39.440
<v Speaker 1>a good value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monogamy,</v>

12
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 1>polygamy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Polygamous societies tend to become </v>

13
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 1>ultra violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.591
<v Speaker 1>That's been known in the anthropological</v>
<v Speaker 1>literature for one Hundred Years and </v>

15
00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>certainly leftist anthropologists were </v>
<v Speaker 1>among those who discovered it,</v>

16
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>like she knew the journalist knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly well.</v>

17
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>What I meant by enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Augie,</v>

18
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.320
<v Speaker 1>she has got a stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

19
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.980
<v Speaker 1>You use it as if everybody would </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it because you're an </v>

20
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.010
<v Speaker 1>intellectual and because you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor and you do.</v>

21
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>It was also two minutes out of a two day</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

22
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>So if that's how she glanced over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:14.991
<v Speaker 1>it's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was funny in some sense because my </v>

24
00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:17.421
<v Speaker 1>sense is if you want to pillory someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>you should attribute to them views that </v>

25
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:21.951
<v Speaker 1>someone somewhere has had and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>implication of that part of the New York</v>

26
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Times article was that I wanted to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>new bile,</v>

27
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:29.661
<v Speaker 1>young women at the point of a gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>understate enforcement and deliver them </v>

28
00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:33.710
<v Speaker 1>to useless man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like no one has ever believed that </v>

29
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.010
<v Speaker 1>trinity sounds like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real.</v>

30
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>The optics of that statement are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

31
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:42.531
<v Speaker 1>but the question is why didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why wasn't their followup questions and </v>

32
00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:46.821
<v Speaker 1>if there was followup questions to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>you to define what you mean by </v>

33
00:01:46.821 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 1>enforcement on there were they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't make it into the piece.</v>

34
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

35
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.210
<v Speaker 1>it's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real problem because that's </v>

36
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.840
<v Speaker 1>what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so ridiculous because inaccurate </v>

37
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>definition of who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I've said continually,</v>

38
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>and this is on record in multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>

39
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

40
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>so you're a young man and all the women </v>
<v Speaker 1>are rejecting you.</v>

41
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Who's got the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not all the women.</v>

42
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad road to go down if all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>women are rejecting you,</v>

43
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.760
<v Speaker 1>it's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We both agree on this,</v>

44
00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:22.500
<v Speaker 1>but why is enforced monogamy the </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution for people that are involuntary</v>

45
00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:23.910
<v Speaker 1>celibates?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

46
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:28.911
<v Speaker 1>it's the solution to the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the solution to the relationship </v>

47
00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally is monogamous.</v>

48
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Social men are unattractive if these on </v>
<v Speaker 1>attraction to them,</v>

49
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:38.901
<v Speaker 1>but these men are unattractive to women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean just physically </v>

50
00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>unattractive mean women aren't seeking </v>
<v Speaker 1>them as mates.</v>

51
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>They need to become men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

52
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:47.541
<v Speaker 1>they certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the solution that's the </v>

53
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:47.541
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

54
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:50.541
<v Speaker 1>We both agree on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what they need to do that in a </v>

55
00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>society where monogamy is the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>norm but isn't the social norm anyway?</v>

56
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was partly my point,</v>

57
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.050
<v Speaker 1>although to the degree that we deviate </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that,</v>

58
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>we tilt towards a more violent society.</v>

59
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.340
<v Speaker 2>I was making a very minor point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're related.</v>

60
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:08.341
<v Speaker 2>Quite honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that involuntary </v>

61
00:03:08.341 --> 00:03:10.741
<v Speaker 2>celibates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that having enforced </v>

62
00:03:10.741 --> 00:03:13.220
<v Speaker 2>monogamy as a part of our cultural norm </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to help those people are really</v>

63
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.690
<v Speaker 2>just how's it going to help them?</v>

64
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what happens is if a polygamous </v>

65
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.850
<v Speaker 1>society develops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the alternative,</v>

66
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.630
<v Speaker 1>then a small minority of men get all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

67
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.550
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only point in this theory,</v>

68
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.790
<v Speaker 2>theoretical world where polygamous </v>
<v Speaker 2>societies exist and mass and then you do</v>

69
00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:37.550
<v Speaker 2>have this problem with a small group of </v>
<v Speaker 2>men that are fucking all the women,</v>

70
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 2>but that's not.</v>

71
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 1>And also making the women unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

72
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Because the women don't have any access </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a genuine intimate one to one </v>

73
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 1>relationship over any long period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

74
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 2>which just doesn't work well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the whole idea is and what's best </v>

75
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.340
<v Speaker 2>for sure if you have children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

76
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.150
<v Speaker 2>but I still don't think that that is why</v>
<v Speaker 2>these men are involuntary celibates and </v>

77
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.341
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's the solution to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the solution is that they need </v>

78
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:03.341
<v Speaker 2>to become attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

79
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:04.880
<v Speaker 2>that is the solution is no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

80
00:04:04.881 --> 00:04:06.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the two are related.</v>

81
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only.</v>

82
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.350
<v Speaker 1>I was making a minor point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The minor point was that one of the ways</v>

83
00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:16.351
<v Speaker 1>that societies around the world have </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out that you keep young male </v>

84
00:04:16.351 --> 00:04:19.891
<v Speaker 1>aggression under control is by enforcing</v>
<v Speaker 1>monogamous standards because it gives </v>

85
00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:20.620
<v Speaker 1>everyone a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

86
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.770
<v Speaker 2>only point meant meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It clears more,</v>

87
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more women will be available for one on </v>

88
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 2>one relationships rather than one guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>who is,</v>

89
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

90
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.370
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reasons,</v>

91
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.090
<v Speaker 1>figure in society when you see this </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in universities where women </v>

92
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.091
<v Speaker 1>outnumber men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the man hypothetically have more </v>

93
00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:48.100
<v Speaker 1>sexual opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what happens.</v>

94
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that a small minority of</v>
<v Speaker 1>men have all the sexual opportunity.</v>

95
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.300
<v Speaker 1>A fairly large minority of men don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The women are unhappy because they can't</v>

96
00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>find a committed relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bad for most of the men and the men</v>

97
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 1>who have all the sexual opportunity get </v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical,</v>

98
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.350
<v Speaker 2>but isn't this in some ways against your</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole idea of equality of outcome </v>

99
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.750
<v Speaker 2>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about equality of sexual </v>

100
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.750
<v Speaker 2>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

101
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.770
<v Speaker 2>if these men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you see that Guy James,</v>

102
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.430
<v Speaker 2>that's the dominant basketball player </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just kicks everyone's ass.</v>

103
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:18.990
<v Speaker 2>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

104
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.690
<v Speaker 2>this is a guy who succeeded at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest level,</v>

105
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

106
00:05:22.441 --> 00:05:24.720
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be people like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually.</v>

107
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.850
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>better at finding mates and this is what</v>

108
00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:32.760
<v Speaker 2>they enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They enjoy having many mates.</v>

109
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.190
<v Speaker 2>They enjoy being yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

110
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.400
<v Speaker 2>but if this is what they enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's a man who doesn't want a family </v>

111
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.270
<v Speaker 2>and enjoys dating multiple women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is that bad?</v>

112
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the fundamental reason it's bad </v>

113
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.750
<v Speaker 2>is because it's bad in the long run for </v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

114
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.350
<v Speaker 2>It's bad for children if he chooses to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have children.</v>

115
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:53.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that makes sense.</v>

116
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 2>But that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the fundamental mental</v>

117
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 1>issue as far as I'm concerned right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the answer.</v>

118
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Look to give the journalist credit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the point she was making,</v>

119
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from pillaring me and,</v>

120
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

121
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 1>and caricaturizing my perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the point she was making.</v>

122
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

123
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:13.991
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in favor of unbridled </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies like already said that you </v>

124
00:06:13.991 --> 00:06:17.790
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proclivity of a hierarchy is that </v>

125
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 1>all the spoils go to the person at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>top and that can destabilize the whole </v>

126
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.201
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have to have a dialogue about how </v>

127
00:06:23.201 --> 00:06:23.201
<v Speaker 1>to rectify that,</v>

128
00:06:23.201 --> 00:06:25.670
<v Speaker 2>possibly rectified that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If one man is like,</v>

129
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 2>say if we've got one six foot five </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful man who's got a perfect body </v>

130
00:06:32.801 --> 00:06:37.801
<v Speaker 2>and he's brilliant and he just wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>date a bunch of women and all the rest </v>

131
00:06:37.801 --> 00:06:41.281
<v Speaker 2>of the people or five foot one and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're fat and they're lazy and like </v>

132
00:06:41.281 --> 00:06:43.120
<v Speaker 2>this guy is gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this is the competition,</v>

133
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.550
<v Speaker 2>he's going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

134
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way around this and even if </v>

135
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.530
<v Speaker 2>you decide to have enforced monogamy </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it becomes a popular thing,</v>

136
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.240
<v Speaker 2>the women are going to be more drawn to </v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

137
00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:58.520
<v Speaker 2>If he chooses to date them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might decide.</v>

138
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.700
<v Speaker 2>I would rather have him sometimes the </v>
<v Speaker 2>never actually what does happen,</v>

139
00:07:03.831 --> 00:07:05.840
<v Speaker 2>but what is wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

140
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:11.360
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with it is that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>destabilized the society and it's bad </v>

141
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.360
<v Speaker 2>for children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

142
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.280
<v Speaker 2>You said that that would have to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>

143
00:07:13.281 --> 00:07:15.180
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to have children.</v>

144
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.300
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that choose to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go their entire life without having </v>

145
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.300
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's men in their thirties.</v>

146
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.500
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of my friends dummies.</v>

147
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.910
<v Speaker 2>They don't want children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why?</v>

148
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Why would that help in any way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These involuntary celibate?</v>

149
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you tilt the society so that it </v>

150
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 1>serves the interests of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

151
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.240
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

152
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.150
<v Speaker 1>but you've seen my point where I see </v>
<v Speaker 1>your point.</v>

153
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:40.080
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about it.</v>

154
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.480
<v Speaker 2>You're almost having.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're almost forcing an inequality of.</v>

155
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.590
<v Speaker 1>I know that was her point to to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree that she had a point that was her</v>

156
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:51.530
<v Speaker 1>point now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

157
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.810
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't run contrary to my opinions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the issue of outcome has to be </v>

158
00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:01.301
<v Speaker 1>addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Already said there's needs to be a </v>

159
00:08:01.301 --> 00:08:01.301
<v Speaker 1>reason for the left and the right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the problem with hierarchies.</v>

160
00:08:01.301 --> 00:08:05.270
<v Speaker 1>They can get to steep and destabilize </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that does happen.</v>

161
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:10.480
<v Speaker 1>That particularly happens in the sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>domain and there's plenty of </v>

162
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.060
<v Speaker 1>anthropological evidence for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still might say,</v>

163
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:11.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

164
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Because the man who are who are winning </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be allowed to win in the women </v>

165
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:17.360
<v Speaker 1>should be allowed to choose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

166
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.540
<v Speaker 1>except that there's the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 1>children and so society steps in on </v>

167
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.810
<v Speaker 1>behalf of the children and you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

168
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.380
<v Speaker 1>lots of people don't want to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

169
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's truer now than it used to be.</v>

170
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Although many of those people end up </v>
<v Speaker 1>having children anyways,</v>

171
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.080
<v Speaker 1>you know the guys who snooping around </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>

172
00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:38.081
<v Speaker 1>so that doesn't circumvent the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the issue here for me isn't the man </v>

173
00:08:38.081 --> 00:08:38.081
<v Speaker 1>or the women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the children.</v>

174
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:43.540
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to set up societies where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that children will be </v>

175
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.961
<v Speaker 1>raised in something approximating </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimal environment is optimized and </v>

176
00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:50.741
<v Speaker 1>that's going to mean sacrifice of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity and choice on the part of </v>

177
00:08:50.741 --> 00:08:50.741
<v Speaker 1>the adults.</v>

178
00:08:50.741 --> 00:08:51.630
<v Speaker 2>It's necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you,</v>

179
00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:56.631
<v Speaker 2>but I think that what we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about mirrors what we're talking about </v>

180
00:08:56.631 --> 00:08:56.631
<v Speaker 2>sports.</v>

181
00:08:56.631 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 1>It mirrors what we're talking about in </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

182
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:03.201
<v Speaker 1>It's everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be people that are </v>

183
00:09:03.201 --> 00:09:06.111
<v Speaker 1>better at all different aspects of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be people that are </v>

184
00:09:06.111 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 1>talented in terms of like getting women </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like that.</v>

185
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true,</v>

186
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:10.530
<v Speaker 1>but that's why also look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see this,</v>

187
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:15.890
<v Speaker 1>women are high pergamum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means they made up and they meet </v>

188
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.910
<v Speaker 1>across and up dominance hierarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you're a male who's successful</v>

189
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:22.911
<v Speaker 1>in a given hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you're going to </v>

190
00:09:22.911 --> 00:09:22.911
<v Speaker 1>have additional mating opportunities is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptionally high.</v>

191
00:09:22.911 --> 00:09:24.830
<v Speaker 1>It's an unbelievably good predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

192
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.860
<v Speaker 1>That hypergo me is a very uncomfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>

193
00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Certainly as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of uncomfortable </v>

194
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:34.080
<v Speaker 1>discussions too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one though.</v>

195
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.990
<v Speaker 1>It is the idea that it defines women's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual choices by the fact that they </v>

196
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.161
<v Speaker 1>want beggar bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better want someone who's more more </v>

197
00:09:43.161 --> 00:09:47.060
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's higher on the social </v>

198
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.690
<v Speaker 1>ladder than what they're accustomed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>or what they have.</v>

199
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.990
<v Speaker 1>What women do is choice is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult problem.</v>

200
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.640
<v Speaker 1>So how do you solve that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

201
00:09:53.641 --> 00:09:55.770
<v Speaker 1>here's how women solve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Throw them in a ring.</v>

202
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Let them compete at whatever they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>competing at.</v>

203
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Assume that the man who wins is the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>man marry him.</v>

204
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant solution.</v>

205
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a market oriented solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually the solution that appears </v>

206
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.810
<v Speaker 1>to have driven our evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>departure from chimpanzees.</v>

207
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a biological solution solution </v>
<v Speaker 1>which has a cost.</v>

208
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.000
<v Speaker 1>What is the cost?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cost is the cost is polygamy,</v>

209
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:25.100
<v Speaker 1>and so we ran that in with enforced </v>
<v Speaker 1>monogamy and we do that in order to </v>

210
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.190
<v Speaker 1>provide stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stable circumstances for children.</v>

211
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Is polyamorous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is a polyamorous society just as </v>

212
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.841
<v Speaker 1>unattainable as this Utopian Marxist </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea?</v>

213
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:41.060
<v Speaker 1>I think so because it looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is another point I was making </v>

214
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.780
<v Speaker 1>that didn't get covered in the article </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I wrote about it somewhat </v>

215
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.201
<v Speaker 1>extensively on my blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that society's tilt towards monogamy </v>

216
00:10:48.201 --> 00:10:49.830
<v Speaker 1>across the world is human universal.</v>

217
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that people don't have</v>

218
00:10:51.571 --> 00:10:56.571
<v Speaker 1>polygamous or polyamorous tendencies </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they certainly do and it </v>

219
00:10:56.571 --> 00:11:00.691
<v Speaker 1>certainly also the case that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways that women Gerrymander this system </v>

220
00:11:00.691 --> 00:11:04.281
<v Speaker 1>is that like the number of women and </v>
<v Speaker 1>children who are in a say say you're </v>

221
00:11:05.941 --> 00:11:08.430
<v Speaker 1>married and you have children with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>husband,</v>

222
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:13.700
<v Speaker 1>but you also have an affair and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a child by another mat that's more </v>

223
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.111
<v Speaker 1>common than anyone suspected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so part of the way that women solve the </v>

224
00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:22.281
<v Speaker 1>problem that you're just describing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying anything for this or </v>

225
00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:26.211
<v Speaker 1>against this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a purely factual biological </v>

226
00:11:26.211 --> 00:11:28.641
<v Speaker 1>claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is they pick a monogamous marriage and </v>

227
00:11:28.641 --> 00:11:31.221
<v Speaker 1>they cheat with high status guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know obviously in the confines </v>

228
00:11:31.221 --> 00:11:32.400
<v Speaker 1>of the marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a terrible thing,</v>

229
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:37.140
<v Speaker 1>but that's a very uncomfortable subject </v>
<v Speaker 1>though for women in particular,</v>

230
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:42.160
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable subject for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a terribly uncomfortable </v>

231
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:42.160
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>

232
00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.360
<v Speaker 1>They don't like the idea that this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>common thing that women choose.</v>

233
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:50.361
<v Speaker 1>A safe man that is willing to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>monogamous with them and perhaps maybe </v>

234
00:11:50.361 --> 00:11:53.890
<v Speaker 1>they're above him in a social class or </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sexually,</v>

235
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.280
<v Speaker 1>and then they'll cheat with someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was above.</v>

236
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.130
<v Speaker 1>It's common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the norm,</v>

237
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:01.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still the norm.</v>

238
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Not to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The norm is fidelity,</v>

239
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:05.890
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's plenty of exception.</v>

240
00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:08.290
<v Speaker 1>This is enforced monogamy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally the norm.</v>

241
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:11.080
<v Speaker 1>This is the very definition of monogamy </v>
<v Speaker 1>is this.</v>

242
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:11.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

243
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:15.430
<v Speaker 1>so my son is getting married in </v>
<v Speaker 1>September and so,</v>

244
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.410
<v Speaker 1>so let's say he comes to me in a year </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he says,</v>

245
00:12:17.411 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Hey dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

246
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I've had three affairs in the last year </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've all been successful.</v>

247
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:23.260
<v Speaker 1>I haven't got caught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aren't I a good guy?</v>

248
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.520
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to say to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know what the hell are you doing?</v>

249
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:29.200
<v Speaker 1>That's not what you're supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

250
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:34.920
<v Speaker 1>That's enforced monogamy enforcement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Origami meaning the people around you </v>

251
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.100
<v Speaker 1>try to guide them in a way that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is going to be harmonious.</v>

252
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

253
00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.030
<v Speaker 1>It's built deep into the cultural norms </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that starts to destabilize,</v>

254
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:48.031
<v Speaker 1>then there's trouble and that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean that it's not prone to all the </v>

255
00:12:48.031 --> 00:12:48.940
<v Speaker 1>problems that you laid out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

256
00:12:48.941 --> 00:12:52.600
<v Speaker 1>there isn't a bigger problem than </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful reproduction.</v>

257
00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:58.170
<v Speaker 1>It is the big problem and all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions that we've generated for it </v>

258
00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.740
<v Speaker 1>are full of flaws.</v>
