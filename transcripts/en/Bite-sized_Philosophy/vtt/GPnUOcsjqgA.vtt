1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.560
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if I read philosophy,</v>

2
00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:04.080
<v Speaker 1>I tend not to read second rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.320
<v Speaker 1>and so I've tried to avoid the </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernist system degree because </v>

4
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.281
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're incoherency is one of the least </v>

5
00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:13.440
<v Speaker 1>of their sins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't care about that.</v>

6
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

7
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.270
<v Speaker 1>You've got to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

8
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 1>the modernists and enlightenment people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and even traditionalist who care about </v>

9
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.921
<v Speaker 1>coherency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the postmodernists don't believe and </v>

10
00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:24.921
<v Speaker 1>coherency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe in.</v>

11
00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making this up.</v>

12
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.110
<v Speaker 1>This is part of their philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe in logic.</v>

13
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Derrida says straight out that Western </v>

14
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.891
<v Speaker 1>society is fallow logo centric by which </v>
<v Speaker 1>he means male centered and privileging.</v>

15
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>The idea of logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:43.971
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't buy any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't think that there is a truth </v>

17
00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:46.490
<v Speaker 1>that's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't believe that individuals can </v>

18
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>reach any sort of truth by thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He certainly doesn't believe that we can</v>

19
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.870
<v Speaker 1>move towards truth in dialogue because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's dialogic,</v>

20
00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

21
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>There's none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wonder,</v>

22
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:54.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do the,</v>

23
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>why did the postmodern types keep other </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinkers off the campus?</v>

24
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not because they're afraid.</v>

25
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so some of them are,</v>

26
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 1>but they used their fragility as a mask </v>
<v Speaker 1>for their,</v>

27
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the underlying philosophical,</v>

28
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>their underlying philosophical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>political interests.</v>

29
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.690
<v Speaker 1>They do that fragmentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like every social justice </v>

30
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.900
<v Speaker 1>warrior is a sword carrying port </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernist,</v>

31
00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:22.901
<v Speaker 1>but the ideas are fragmented and </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed among them like they're </v>

32
00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 1>distributed among a mob and if you put </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole mob together,</v>

33
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.320
<v Speaker 1>you get the whole post modernist thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening at the same time and that's </v>

34
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>how ideas have people instead of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other way around.</v>

35
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.580
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget about logic that's out the </v>

36
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.601
<v Speaker 1>window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just a construct of Western </v>

37
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.581
<v Speaker 1>society and and the whole point of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>construct was to oppress other people </v>

38
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:48.021
<v Speaker 1>and to take their wealth and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>privilege the people who live within </v>

39
00:01:48.021 --> 00:01:52.011
<v Speaker 1>that so called logic system so that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can justify to themselves and other </v>

40
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:56.331
<v Speaker 1>people their Predator rapaciousness </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight and simple and that's partly </v>

41
00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:02.541
<v Speaker 1>because postmodernism was influenced by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marxism and of course that's what the </v>

42
00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Marxists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about any situation where there is</v>

43
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:09.021
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it a power status </v>

44
00:02:09.021 --> 00:02:10.941
<v Speaker 1>differential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people at the top are only there </v>

45
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>because they've stole everything from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people at the bottom.</v>
