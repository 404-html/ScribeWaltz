1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.940
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about the gulag camps,</v>

2
00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:07.941
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant to understanding of modern </v>

3
00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.911
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that so ordinary criminals were put </v>

4
00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:10.911
<v Speaker 1>into the camps and so were political </v>
<v Speaker 1>prisoners,</v>

5
00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:12.600
<v Speaker 1>prisoners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ordinary criminals,</v>

6
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:14.460
<v Speaker 1>and so those would be rapists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>murderers,</v>

7
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:19.461
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as thieves who were engaged in </v>

8
00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:22.730
<v Speaker 1>theft as an occupation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were regarded by the Soviets as </v>

9
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.451
<v Speaker 1>socially friendly elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that was that they </v>

10
00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:30.351
<v Speaker 1>assume that the reason that these people</v>
<v Speaker 1>had turned to crime was because the </v>

11
00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:33.660
<v Speaker 1>approach of the oppressive nature of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>previous czarist slash capitalist system</v>

12
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 1>and that the only reason that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminals existed was because they had </v>

13
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.291
<v Speaker 1>been oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were oppressed victims of that </v>

14
00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:45.471
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the convenient </v>

15
00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:47.810
<v Speaker 1>consequences of that absolutely insane </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctrine was that the Soviets put the </v>

16
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 1>ordinary criminals in charge of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>camps and these were very,</v>

17
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>very seriously bad people.</v>

18
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>And so you could imagine the way that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they treated the political prisoners who</v>

19
00:00:56.761 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>were regarded as socially hostile </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements.</v>

20
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes because of their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically traitorous acts,</v>

21
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:08.031
<v Speaker 1>but more often merely as a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their racial or ethnic identity or </v>

22
00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:13.041
<v Speaker 1>the fact that they were related by birth</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say people who had been successful </v>

23
00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 1>under the previous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so who had any,</v>

24
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.030
<v Speaker 1>any association with nobility or any </v>
<v Speaker 1>association with what were known as the </v>

25
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.961
<v Speaker 1>Kulaks who were the only successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>class of former peasants in the Soviet </v>

26
00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Union because they were regarded as </v>
<v Speaker 1>privileged.</v>

27
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>You may have heard that word more </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>

28
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>They were regarded as privileged and </v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore as enemies of the state,</v>

29
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't matter if it was your </v>
<v Speaker 1>father or your grandfather or your great</v>

30
00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:37.770
<v Speaker 1>grandfather who happened to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>privileged,</v>

31
00:01:37.771 --> 00:01:42.771
<v Speaker 1>but the mere fact that you were a member</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that group was sufficient reason to </v>

32
00:01:42.771 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>put you into a camp.</v>

33
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 1>And we're talking hundreds of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps millions of people who </v>

34
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>underwent that fate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea and the Soviet Union was</v>

35
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>just because you were the member of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

36
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Even as a consequence of your familial </v>
<v Speaker 1>association.</v>

37
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.510
<v Speaker 1>You were immediately sufficiently guilty</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be put into a camp and punished.</v>

38
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:05.511
<v Speaker 1>And the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the terms for the camps were often </v>

39
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:05.511
<v Speaker 1>10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years long,</v>

40
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>and if you were very fortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to have two or three of those.</v>

41
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.040
<v Speaker 1>So the Soviets really instant </v>
<v Speaker 1>implemented and,</v>

42
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:18.041
<v Speaker 1>and perfected the idea of class and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is based guilt and it's a very bad </v>

43
00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:23.631
<v Speaker 1>road to walk down and it's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're very much engaged in at the </v>

44
00:02:23.631 --> 00:02:27.231
<v Speaker 1>moment because there's discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere in North America now about </v>

45
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>the idea of while race predicated guilt </v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

46
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.820
<v Speaker 1>and ethnic predicated guilt and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>very bad idea to classify an entire </v>

47
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 1>group of people as guilty of anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on their group membership.</v>

48
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.970
<v Speaker 1>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these sorts of things are things we </v>

49
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.970
<v Speaker 1>haven't yet learned and certainly should</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
