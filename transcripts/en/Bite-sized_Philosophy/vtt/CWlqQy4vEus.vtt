1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.880
<v Speaker 1>And the sons of Noah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went forth of the Ark were shem and</v>

2
00:00:03.881 --> 00:00:07.930
<v Speaker 1>ham and Japheth and ham is the father of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canaan.</v>

3
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.490
<v Speaker 1>These are the three sons of Noah and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them was the whole Earth overspread and </v>

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.650
<v Speaker 1>no began to be a hud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Husbands,</v>

5
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he planted a vineyard and he drank </v>

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.680
<v Speaker 1>of the wine and was drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was uncovered within his tent and</v>

7
00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:28.681
<v Speaker 1>Ham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The father of Canaan saw the nakedness </v>

8
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:31.261
<v Speaker 1>of his father and told his two brethren </v>
<v Speaker 1>without and Shem and Japheth took a </v>

9
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:37.221
<v Speaker 1>garment and laid upon both their </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders and went backward and covered </v>

10
00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:40.821
<v Speaker 1>the nakedness of their father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And their faces were backward and they </v>

11
00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:43.881
<v Speaker 1>saw not their father's nakedness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Noah awoke from his wine and knew </v>

12
00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 1>what his younger son had done unto him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

13
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>curse it to be Canaan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A servant of servants,</v>

14
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:53.440
<v Speaker 1>shall he be unto his brethren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

15
00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:57.160
<v Speaker 1>blessed shall be the Lord God of Sham </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Canaan shall be his servant.</v>

16
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>And God enlarge Japheth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he shall dwell in the tents of Shem </v>

17
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.170
<v Speaker 1>and Canaan shall be his servant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Noah lived after the flood,</v>

18
00:01:05.171 --> 00:01:09.430
<v Speaker 1>350 years and all the days of Noah were </v>
<v Speaker 1>950 years and he died</v>

19
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.920
<v Speaker 1>and the whole earth was of one language </v>
<v Speaker 1>and of one speech.</v>

20
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I remember thinking about this story,</v>

21
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.750
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be 30 years ago</v>

22
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.240
<v Speaker 1>and I think the meaning of the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>stood out for me.</v>

23
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when you read complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>materials,</v>

24
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:37.520
<v Speaker 1>sometimes a piece of it will stand out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for some reason like it glitters.</v>

25
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that might be one way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it.</v>

26
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.270
<v Speaker 1>It's you're in sync with it and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what it means.</v>

27
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:46.580
<v Speaker 1>I've really experienced that reading the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tao Te Ching,</v>

28
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.940
<v Speaker 1>which is document I would really like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a lecture on at some point because </v>

29
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.051
<v Speaker 1>some of the verses I don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but others stand right out and I can </v>

30
00:01:56.051 --> 00:01:59.081
<v Speaker 1>understand them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think I understood what this part </v>

31
00:01:59.081 --> 00:01:59.081
<v Speaker 1>of the story of no amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it means,</v>

32
00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked a little bit about what </v>

33
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>nakedness meant in the story of Adam and</v>
<v Speaker 1>eve.</v>

34
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.530
<v Speaker 1>And the idea essentially was that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know yourself naked is to become aware </v>

35
00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:11.780
<v Speaker 1>of your vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physical,</v>

36
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.000
<v Speaker 1>your physical boundaries in time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>

37
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.670
<v Speaker 1>and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

38
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.180
<v Speaker 1>your physiological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fundamental physiological </v>

39
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.320
<v Speaker 1>insufficiencies as they make might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>judged by others.</v>

40
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.320
<v Speaker 1>So there's biological insufficiency that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of built into you because you're a </v>

41
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.360
<v Speaker 1>fragile mortal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable half insane creature and,</v>

42
00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:33.770
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just an existential truth.</v>

43
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:38.090
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even merely as a human being,</v>

44
00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:43.091
<v Speaker 1>even with all those faults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are faults that you have that are </v>

45
00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:45.170
<v Speaker 1>particular to you that might be judged </v>
<v Speaker 1>harshly by the group while might be,</v>

46
00:02:45.171 --> 00:02:47.870
<v Speaker 1>we'll definitely be judged harshly by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the group.</v>

47
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.390
<v Speaker 1>And so to become aware of your nakedness</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to become self conscious and,</v>

48
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.650
<v Speaker 1>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to,</v>

49
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.650
<v Speaker 1>to know your limits and to know your </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability.</v>

50
00:02:54.651 --> 00:02:59.651
<v Speaker 1>And that's what is revealed to when he </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes across his father naked.</v>

51
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:07.201
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is what does it mean to </v>

52
00:03:07.201 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 1>see your father naked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me,</v>

53
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:10.250
<v Speaker 1>and especially in an inappropriate </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner like this,</v>

54
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.730
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

55
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

56
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

57
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.880
<v Speaker 1>it's as if ham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does the same thing that happens in </v>

58
00:03:19.091 --> 00:03:24.091
<v Speaker 1>the Mesopotamian creation myth when when</v>
<v Speaker 1>timeout an absolute give rise to the </v>

59
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:29.161
<v Speaker 1>first God's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the father of the eventual daddy</v>

60
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>of redemption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marduk there are very careless and noisy</v>

61
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 1>and the kill app suit their father and </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to inhabit his corpse.</v>

62
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.710
<v Speaker 1>And that makes timeout enraged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so she bursts forth from the </v>

63
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>darkness to do the men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a precursor to the flood story</v>

64
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.500
<v Speaker 1>or an analog to the flood story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I see the same thing happening here </v>

65
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.101
<v Speaker 1>with him is that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's insufficiently respectful of his </v>

66
00:03:56.101 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

67
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.350
<v Speaker 1>and the question is exactly what does </v>
<v Speaker 1>the father represent?</v>

68
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's,</v>

69
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.550
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the father that you have and </v>

70
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.550
<v Speaker 1>that's a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

71
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.300
<v Speaker 1>that's a man like other men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man among men.</v>

72
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 1>But then there's the farther as such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the spirit of the father.</v>

73
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>And in so far as you have a father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have both at the same time.</v>

74
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 1>You have the personal father that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>man among other men,</v>

75
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 1>just like anyone out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his father,</v>

76
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:23.860
<v Speaker 1>but in so far as that man is your </v>
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>

77
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:28.861
<v Speaker 1>that means that he's something different</v>
<v Speaker 1>than just another person and what he is </v>

78
00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:33.121
<v Speaker 1>is the incarnation of the spirit of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>father and to see that,</v>

79
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 1>to take it to what to disrespect that </v>
<v Speaker 1>carelessly,</v>

80
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 1>maybe even like no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes a mistake,</v>

81
00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:40.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

82
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.520
<v Speaker 1>He produces wine and gets himself drunk </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might say,</v>

83
00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>if he's sprawled out there for everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see,</v>

85
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Speaker 1>it's hardly hams fault if he stumbles </v>
<v Speaker 1>across him,</v>

86
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:55.951
<v Speaker 1>but the book is laying out a danger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the danger is that,</v>

87
00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you catch your father at his most </v>

88
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.310
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable moment and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>disrespectful,</v>

89
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.760
<v Speaker 1>then you transgress against the spirit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the father and if you transgress </v>

90
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.081
<v Speaker 1>against the spirit of father and lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit of the father and lose </v>

91
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:16.261
<v Speaker 1>respect for the spirit of the father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that is likely to transform you </v>

92
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.420
<v Speaker 1>into a slave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very interesting idea and I </v>

93
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.470
<v Speaker 1>think it's particularly interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not particularly interesting,</v>

94
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:26.200
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's particularly Germane.</v>

95
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.660
<v Speaker 1>I think to our current cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

96
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:33.661
<v Speaker 1>because I think that were pushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly to see the nakedness of our </v>

97
00:05:33.661 --> 00:05:34.690
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

98
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:41.010
<v Speaker 1>because of the intense criticism that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>directed towards our culture and the </v>

99
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

100
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:50.130
<v Speaker 1>We're constantly exposing its weaknesses</v>
<v Speaker 1>and vulnerabilities and let's say </v>

101
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>nakedness and there's nothing wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism,</v>

102
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:58.051
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about criticism is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose of criticism is to separate </v>

103
00:05:58.051 --> 00:06:02.050
<v Speaker 1>wheat from the chaff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the burn everything to the </v>

104
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.050
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

105
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.050
<v Speaker 1>It's to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

106
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>we're going to carefully look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to carefully differentiate.</v>

107
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:10.721
<v Speaker 1>We're going to keep what's good and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to move away from what's </v>

108
00:06:10.721 --> 00:06:13.181
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point of the criticism isn't to </v>

109
00:06:13.181 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>identify everything is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's two separate.</v>

110
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:18.881
<v Speaker 1>What's good from what's bad so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can retain what's good and move towards </v>

111
00:06:18.881 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 1>it and to be careless at that is deadly </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're inhabited by the spirit </v>

112
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 1>of the father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

113
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 1>In so far as you're a cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction,</v>

114
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:32.771
<v Speaker 1>which of course is something that the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The postmodern neo Marxist sort </v>

115
00:06:32.771 --> 00:06:36.110
<v Speaker 1>absolutely emphatic about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a cultural construction in so far</v>

116
00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:41.111
<v Speaker 1>as you're a cultural construction than </v>
<v Speaker 1>your inhabited by the spirit of the </v>

117
00:06:41.111 --> 00:06:44.261
<v Speaker 1>father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to be disrespectful towards that </v>

118
00:06:44.261 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 1>means to undermine the very structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes you not all of what you are.</v>

119
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Certainly certainly not all of what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

120
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:54.611
<v Speaker 1>but a good portion of what you are in so</v>
<v Speaker 1>far as you're a socialized cultural </v>

121
00:06:54.611 --> 00:06:58.991
<v Speaker 1>entity and if you pull out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you pull the foundation out from </v>

122
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:01.460
<v Speaker 1>underneath that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you have left?</v>

123
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.800
<v Speaker 1>You can hardly manage on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

124
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.850
<v Speaker 1>it's just not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a cultural creation and so hamm </v>

125
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.280
<v Speaker 1>makes this desperate error and is </v>
<v Speaker 1>careless about exposing himself to the </v>

126
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:19.820
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability of his father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

127
00:07:19.821 --> 00:07:24.821
<v Speaker 1>He does it without sufficient respect </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the judgment is that not only will </v>

128
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:30.041
<v Speaker 1>he be a slave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so will all of his descendants and </v>

129
00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:33.161
<v Speaker 1>these contrasted with the other two sons</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I suppose are willing to give their </v>

130
00:07:33.351 --> 00:07:35.720
<v Speaker 1>father the benefit of the doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

131
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 1>And so when they see him in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>compromising position,</v>

132
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.110
<v Speaker 1>they handle it with respect and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

133
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.480
<v Speaker 1>and don't capitalize on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that makes them strong,</v>

134
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:53.020
<v Speaker 1>that's what it seems to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that's what that story </v>

135
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.381
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has something to do with respect,</v>

136
00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the funny thing about having respect</v>

137
00:07:59.921 --> 00:08:04.921
<v Speaker 1>for your culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I suppose that's partly why I'm </v>

138
00:08:04.921 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 1>doing the biblical stories is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're part of,</v>

139
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.280
<v Speaker 1>they're part of my culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're part of our culture perhaps,</v>

140
00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:14.050
<v Speaker 1>but they're certainly part of my culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems to me that</v>

141
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 1>it's worthwhile to treat that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect to see what you can glean from </v>

142
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.340
<v Speaker 1>it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not kick it when it's down,</v>

143
00:08:23.341 --> 00:08:25.830
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

144
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.970
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how the story of Noah </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends,</v>

145
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:40.030
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing too is Noah is actually a </v>

146
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.500
<v Speaker 1>pretty decent incarnation of the spirit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the father.</v>

147
00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:47.501
<v Speaker 1>That which I suppose is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that makes Hams misstep more </v>

148
00:08:47.901 --> 00:08:50.130
<v Speaker 1>egregious is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

149
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:55.140
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just built an ark and got everybody </v>

150
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.140
<v Speaker 1>through the flood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

151
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not so bad in.</v>

152
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.681
<v Speaker 1>So maybe the fact that he happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>drink too much wine one day wasn't </v>

153
00:08:59.681 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 1>enough to justify humiliating him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

154
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's pushing the limits of</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic interpretation to note on a </v>

155
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.860
<v Speaker 1>daily basis that were all contained in </v>
<v Speaker 1>an arc.</v>

156
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the arc that you can think </v>

157
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:17.310
<v Speaker 1>about that as the arc that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>bequeathed to us by our forefathers.</v>

158
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:21.120
<v Speaker 1>That's the tremendous infrastructure </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we inhabit,</v>

159
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.840
<v Speaker 1>that we take for granted because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>works so well that protects us from </v>

160
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.170
<v Speaker 1>things that we can't even imagine.</v>

161
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.720
<v Speaker 1>And we don't have to imagine because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're so well protected.</v>

162
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.140
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>struck me hard,</v>

163
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:39.470
<v Speaker 1>I would say about the disintegration and</v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption of the universities is the </v>

164
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.670
<v Speaker 1>absolute in gratitude that goes along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

165
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism as I said,</v>

166
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:49.701
<v Speaker 1>is a fine thing if it's done in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>spirit in a proper spirit and that's the</v>

167
00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:52.050
<v Speaker 1>spirit of separating the wheat from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaff.</v>

168
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.360
<v Speaker 1>But it needs to be accompanied by </v>
<v Speaker 1>gratitude.</v>

169
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.950
<v Speaker 1>And it does seem to me that anyone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives in in the west,</v>

170
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:04.270
<v Speaker 1>in the western culture at this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in history and in this place and who </v>

171
00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:09.170
<v Speaker 1>isn't similar [inaudible] grateful for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

172
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:14.590
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is half blind at least because it's </v>

173
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.250
<v Speaker 1>never been better than this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it could be so much worse.</v>

174
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.190
<v Speaker 1>And it's highly likely that it will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>so much worse.</v>

175
00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Because for most of human history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much worse is the norm.</v>
