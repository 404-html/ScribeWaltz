1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my main question is actually something </v>

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.081
<v Speaker 1>you said a couple of lectures ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something along the lines of a </v>

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.220
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

5
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.890
<v Speaker 1>that's the history of your family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of like the sins of your family,</v>

6
00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:16.650
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.630
<v Speaker 1>you're facing it all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

9
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.670
<v Speaker 1>What's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you expand on that more?</v>

10
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this idea in the old testament </v>

11
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.231
<v Speaker 2>that your sins might be visited onto </v>
<v Speaker 2>your family seven generations down.</v>

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 2>Seems kind of harsh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

13
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.100
<v Speaker 2>when you're confronting maybe your </v>
<v Speaker 2>father's tyrannical.</v>

14
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

15
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:46.510
<v Speaker 2>maybe his father beat the hell out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>him and maybe his father,</v>

16
00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:51.511
<v Speaker 2>his father was a vicious alcoholic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he just bloody well don't know how far </v>

17
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:52.530
<v Speaker 2>back that goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

18
00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 2>and that means also you don't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what you're dealing with,</v>

19
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To some degree you're dealing with your </v>

20
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.700
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only partly what you're dealing with</v>

21
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 2>is the pathological paternal spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

22
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.230
<v Speaker 2>And it's better to think about that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it becomes an existential issue </v>

23
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.230
<v Speaker 2>at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

24
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 2>So you could say that while the father </v>
<v Speaker 2>has two components,</v>

25
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.850
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this psychologically speaking,</v>

26
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 2>there's the great father that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>beneficial in protective,</v>

27
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.730
<v Speaker 2>that organize the society and teaches </v>
<v Speaker 2>you how to speak and has produced all </v>

28
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.441
<v Speaker 2>these wonderful things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then there's the tyrannical </v>

29
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:29.930
<v Speaker 2>oppressive part of the father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like there's the terrible part of </v>

30
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.401
<v Speaker 2>mother nature that's destructive and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>benevolent part of Mother Nature that's </v>

31
00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 2>wonderful and productive and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck with that,</v>

32
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

33
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 2>You're stuck with having to mediate </v>
<v Speaker 2>between those opposing forces,</v>

34
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:45.711
<v Speaker 2>just like you're stuck with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>adversarial part of yourself in the </v>

35
00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:46.710
<v Speaker 2>heroic part of yourself and it's up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to set those things.</v>

36
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:50.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise they propagate into the future</v>

37
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.880
<v Speaker 2>and it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a straightforward thing to say how </v>

38
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.880
<v Speaker 2>to set them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

39
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.120
<v Speaker 2>There's quite a good movie about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

40
00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:02.660
<v Speaker 2>I won't be Magnolia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I really love.</v>

41
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.940
<v Speaker 2>It's by Paul Anderson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I remember correctly.</v>

42
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.030
<v Speaker 2>I hope that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a beautiful movie and it's about </v>

43
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.820
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of it's about this kid whose father</v>

44
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.280
<v Speaker 2>is really pushing them to be a superstar</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a,</v>

45
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 2>at a quistio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

46
00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:15.950
<v Speaker 2>He's a genius kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

47
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.480
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

48
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.290
<v Speaker 2>the kids studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy named Charles Sport,</v>

49
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.320
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand this movie if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know this because you got to know </v>

50
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.320
<v Speaker 2>about Charles fort to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnolia.</v>

51
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Charles for was this weird old guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>got rich with an inheritance when he was</v>

52
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.950
<v Speaker 2>20 and spent the rest of his life in </v>
<v Speaker 2>libraries looking up impossible things </v>

53
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.911
<v Speaker 2>and documenting them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Impossible things that couldn't happen </v>

54
00:02:39.911 --> 00:02:43.451
<v Speaker 2>from a scientific perspective that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>well attested to by multiple observers </v>

55
00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:45.740
<v Speaker 2>and he produced this news paper called </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 14 times,</v>

56
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:50.741
<v Speaker 2>which still runs anyways in Magnolia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Magnolia begins with this guy who falls </v>

57
00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:56.711
<v Speaker 2>out of a building and then it's shot by </v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman who misses her husband with a </v>

58
00:02:56.711 --> 00:03:00.701
<v Speaker 2>rifle as he falls and I think she's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's charged murder and the street </v>

59
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:03.240
<v Speaker 2>names have something to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>death sentence fault.</v>

60
00:03:03.241 --> 00:03:08.241
<v Speaker 2>And all of that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then in the movie there's a rain of </v>

61
00:03:08.241 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 2>frogs and there are rains of frogs from </v>
<v Speaker 2>time to time.</v>

62
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they're frozen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes their reins of fish.</v>

63
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they're frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

64
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that happen?</v>

65
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 2>Happens quite frequently as it turns out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a rain of frogs in the,</v>

66
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

67
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.040
<v Speaker 2>movie magnolia and this little kid see </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened to him is that he's on </v>

68
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.511
<v Speaker 2>stage and he ends up peeing his pants </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the pressure basically and </v>

69
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:37.441
<v Speaker 2>humiliates himself and then there's this</v>
<v Speaker 2>reign of frogs which she kind of takes </v>

70
00:03:37.441 --> 00:03:42.021
<v Speaker 2>us a sign from God and then he goes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>his father even he's like eight years </v>

71
00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:42.220
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kid and he says,</v>

72
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.270
<v Speaker 2>you have to stop doing this to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He's dead serious about very careful</v>

73
00:03:47.271 --> 00:03:48.920
<v Speaker 2>not being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

74
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.500
<v Speaker 2>what would you call insubordinate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing like that.</v>

75
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.320
<v Speaker 2>He decides that that's coming to an end </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

76
00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 2>And you have to make those decisions in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your family because otherwise things </v>

77
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.830
<v Speaker 2>propagate down the generations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

78
00:04:00.831 --> 00:04:04.280
<v Speaker 2>And every family is rife with </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathologies of one form or another.</v>

79
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.200
<v Speaker 2>And you can learn from that and refused </v>
<v Speaker 2>to push it forward.</v>

80
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.810
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what you do when you,</v>

81
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.650
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

82
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.770
<v Speaker 3>when you</v>

83
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.630
<v Speaker 2>shoulder your existential burden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because everyone is the beneficiary and </v>

84
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.550
<v Speaker 2>the victim of the tyrannical father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like everyone is the beneficiary.</v>

85
00:04:23.551 --> 00:04:26.010
<v Speaker 2>And the victim of mother nature and of </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

86
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.790
<v Speaker 2>and so you lock horns without and </v>
<v Speaker 2>straightened it out one way or another </v>

87
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.090
<v Speaker 2>and you don't move it forward to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next generation.</v>

88
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.930
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe you detach it a bit from your </v>

89
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.961
<v Speaker 2>parents too because God only knows what </v>
<v Speaker 2>combination of catastrophes culminated </v>

90
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 2>in their particular forms of pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

91
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.640
<v Speaker 3>good enough.</v>
