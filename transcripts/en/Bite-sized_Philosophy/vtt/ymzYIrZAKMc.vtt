1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.180
<v Speaker 1>And so Pinocchio was left without the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guidance of conscience and the cricket </v>

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.490
<v Speaker 1>is trying to figure out how to get off </v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure island back.</v>

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.850
<v Speaker 1>He goes through the gates and he sees </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's actually going on and what's </v>

4
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.351
<v Speaker 1>going on is that the coach when has this</v>
<v Speaker 1>like slave boat down in the bowels of </v>

5
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:24.111
<v Speaker 1>the island and he's got all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these black suited minions with the </v>

6
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>glowing eyes working for him and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>rounding up what looked like donkeys.</v>

7
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.160
<v Speaker 1>And so they're are beasts of burden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:34.970
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an idea here that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce,</v>

9
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.580
<v Speaker 1>if you pursue impulsive pleasure to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>detriment of the development of your </v>

10
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.331
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to end up a beast of </v>

11
00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:46.521
<v Speaker 1>burden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to end up a slave to a </v>

12
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:46.521
<v Speaker 1>tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly right.</v>

13
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put other cricket doesn't.</v>

14
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.900
<v Speaker 1>You can see one of those black suited </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrors here,</v>

15
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.950
<v Speaker 1>hauling donkeys out of this crate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them has a hat on and they look </v>

16
00:00:58.171 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>very sad and they're in different </v>
<v Speaker 1>crates.</v>

17
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>And one of them says sold to the salt </v>
<v Speaker 1>mines.</v>

18
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>And one says sold to the circus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're shipped off to be,</v>

19
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>to be slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

20
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>and they look very sad and then one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them gets hauled out of a crate and he's</v>

21
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 1>still got a hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a hat on and a sweater and he can</v>

22
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:18.690
<v Speaker 1>still talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a boy.</v>

23
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that's been half </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed into a jackass,</v>

24
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>abrading jackass prior to being </v>
<v Speaker 1>enslaved.</v>

25
00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:30.741
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing that's quite </v>

26
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:30.741
<v Speaker 1>interesting about the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:30.741
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

28
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:34.670
<v Speaker 1>it also makes the case that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>replace your voice with stupid brain,</v>

29
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.160
<v Speaker 1>that the probability that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to become enslaved by a tyrant is </v>

30
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.941
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always can't help but think about </v>

31
00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:46.530
<v Speaker 1>idiot idiot logs in that manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

32
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Solzhenitsyn wrote about the radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>left ideologues that got thrown in the </v>

33
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Gulag archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 1>so they were part party stalwarts.</v>

35
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.760
<v Speaker 1>This happened to a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true believers who are vacuumed up by </v>

36
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.780
<v Speaker 1>the in this machine and thrown in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown into the ghoulag anyways.</v>

37
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.200
<v Speaker 1>And he said that those people suffered </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways more than everyone else </v>

38
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.671
<v Speaker 1>because what did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were bit by the beloved hand that </v>

39
00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:11.970
<v Speaker 1>fed them and so the first while when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were in the camps,</v>

40
00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>socialism really didn't know what to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with people like that because on the one</v>

41
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:19.791
<v Speaker 1>hand while they were in the camps and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't that awful and they'd been torn </v>

42
00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 1>away from their families and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stripped of all their identity and their</v>

43
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:26.931
<v Speaker 1>status and so that's pretty rough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on another hand they were writing </v>

44
00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:31.431
<v Speaker 1>letters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protesting their innocence and assuming </v>

45
00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:33.621
<v Speaker 1>that everyone else in the camp was </v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty but they were innocent and they </v>

46
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:36.090
<v Speaker 1>were still strident believers in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communist process.</v>

47
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:40.680
<v Speaker 1>it was a conundrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here they are being terribly punished,</v>

49
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>but by the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are also.</v>

50
00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>The perpetrators have their own demise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you deal with them?</v>

51
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:50.391
<v Speaker 1>And they used to play comrades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said they used to play comrades with </v>

52
00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:54.321
<v Speaker 1>people like that and invite them into an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological discussion about the camp </v>

53
00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:59.200
<v Speaker 1>situation and the situation in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country as a whole and let them rattle </v>

54
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:04.230
<v Speaker 1>out their idiot logical justifications </v>
<v Speaker 1>for everything that had happened in,</v>

55
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>in trying to make them parody </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

56
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a rough game and Solzhenitsyn </v>

57
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.300
<v Speaker 1>also concluded that</v>

58
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.480
<v Speaker 1>there is no helping someone like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were still ensconced inside </v>

59
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.801
<v Speaker 1>that brain ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can predict everything they were </v>

60
00:03:24.801 --> 00:03:25.260
<v Speaker 1>going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like someone had a crank,</v>

61
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.740
<v Speaker 1>you could just crank it and out would </v>
<v Speaker 1>come the proper radiological formulas,</v>

62
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.960
<v Speaker 1>but then he realized that as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

63
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 1>let's call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repented of that and started to realize </v>

64
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.220
<v Speaker 1>their own role in it or the era of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

65
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.370
<v Speaker 1>then he would start communicating with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

66
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if they were people who who you could</v>

67
00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:47.280
<v Speaker 1>communicate with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

68
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.830
<v Speaker 1>so that was very interesting as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned.</v>

69
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid is still a little bit human.</v>

70
00:03:52.411 --> 00:03:57.411
<v Speaker 1>He starts to cry for his mom and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coachman basically throws them back into</v>

71
00:03:57.451 --> 00:03:59.310
<v Speaker 1>the crate and says that he's not ready </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>

72
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.110
<v Speaker 1>and the reason for that is that he could</v>
<v Speaker 1>still.</v>

73
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.990
<v Speaker 1>He still had the power of independent </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

74
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.440
<v Speaker 1>You remember right at the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie when the Mouse was painted on </v>

75
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw that mask that was really glaring</v>

76
00:04:12.331 --> 00:04:16.440
<v Speaker 1>at the process and I said that character</v>
<v Speaker 1>recurs continually throughout the movie.</v>

77
00:04:16.441 --> 00:04:18.870
<v Speaker 1>And here's a good example of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the coach,</v>

78
00:04:18.871 --> 00:04:21.810
<v Speaker 1>when is the enemy of anything that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>its own voice.</v>

79
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.450
<v Speaker 1>So he's the anti Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

80
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 1>that's a good way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the tyrannical aspect of the,</v>

81
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>of the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as in so far as one of these mostly </v>

82
00:04:32.131 --> 00:04:34.530
<v Speaker 1>donkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly jackasses can still talk.</v>

83
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Then they're not completely fit for </v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery.</v>

84
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.190
<v Speaker 1>And you remember this movie was being </v>
<v Speaker 1>made at about the same time that the </v>

85
00:04:43.531 --> 00:04:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Nazi transformation of Germany was </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking place.</v>

86
00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:48.930
<v Speaker 1>And so all these terrible underground </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

87
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.990
<v Speaker 1>you know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this process whereby people were being </v>

88
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.411
<v Speaker 1>reduced to two ideological slave say and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this terrible process that was all </v>

89
00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:03.381
<v Speaker 1>playing out in Europe in a very big way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not like people weren't aware </v>

90
00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:05.190
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.590
<v Speaker 1>it was in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

92
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 1>any ways that the donkey's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jack asses that can still talk,</v>

93
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:19.771
<v Speaker 1>her crying and complaining and repenting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the coachman turns into a full Kyron</v>

94
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.880
<v Speaker 1>again in cracks the whip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

95
00:05:22.881 --> 00:05:25.430
<v Speaker 1>and says you've had your fun and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to pay for it.</v>

96
00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.060
<v Speaker 1>So the cricket gets word of all this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets wind of it.</v>

97
00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:34.061
<v Speaker 1>He starts to understand what's happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that all these bad kids were enticed </v>

98
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:35.960
<v Speaker 1>out onto this island so that they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be enslaved.</v>

99
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.920
<v Speaker 1>And he's really taken aback by that to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say the least.</v>

100
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.770
<v Speaker 1>But he realizes what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So He runs back to find Pinocchio.</v>

101
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Speaker 1>And then the scene switches back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight ball bar where I'm lamp wick is </v>

102
00:05:50.301 --> 00:05:53.000
<v Speaker 1>drinking beer and complaining about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conscience said,</v>

103
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he's kind of guilty,</v>

104
00:05:54.471 --> 00:05:56.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm ashamed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he won't admit it because he doesn't</v>

105
00:05:56.631 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>admit he knows everything.</v>

106
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to admit anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself that isn't perfect.</v>

107
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.680
<v Speaker 1>He's a real totalitarian in training and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he drinks this beer and he's laughing </v>

108
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>about the conscious and putting them </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

109
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 1>And then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

110
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

111
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:11.930
<v Speaker 1>what does he say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly?</v>

112
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.020
<v Speaker 1>What does he think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a jack ass or something like that.</v>

113
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's not the words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

114
00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 1>And then he grows these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ears from Pinocchio,</v>

115
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 1>sees that and immediately takes a look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the beer and stops drinking it.</v>

116
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.320
<v Speaker 1>And then land put transformers one more </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and his face turns into the face of</v>

117
00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:31.400
<v Speaker 1>a donkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's laughing still.</v>

118
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 1>And then his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his hands.</v>

119
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He laughs suddenly starts to bray like </v>

120
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.710
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a jackass.</v>

121
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.611
<v Speaker 1>And he's horrified by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Pinocchio laughs and the brain </v>

122
00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:47.561
<v Speaker 1>comes out as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now they're absolutely horrified </v>

123
00:06:47.561 --> 00:06:47.600
<v Speaker 1>and lampock actually figures out what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

124
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.600
<v Speaker 1>He figures out that he's been tricked </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that he's transforming and he's </v>

125
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 1>completely horrified by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He becomes conscious of what's happening</v>

126
00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:59.741
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's one particularly I would </v>

127
00:06:59.741 --> 00:07:02.081
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatic scene where his hands have </v>

128
00:07:02.081 --> 00:07:03.590
<v Speaker 1>transformed in hooves and he's kicking </v>
<v Speaker 1>in and,</v>

129
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.990
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a leaping around the room and panic </v>

130
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 1>and he comes up to a mirror and sees </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself as a Jack Ass.</v>

131
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:12.140
<v Speaker 1>And then he turns around and breaks the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror.</v>

132
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:13.400
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.460
<v Speaker 1>he self conscious for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he destroys his capacity for self </v>

134
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.760
<v Speaker 1>consciousness that he transforms </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely into a jackass.</v>

135
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.040
<v Speaker 1>He's farther down the road than </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio.</v>

136
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.520
<v Speaker 1>And he comes crawling to Pinocchio to </v>
<v Speaker 1>save him and asks that the conscience </v>

137
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.880
<v Speaker 1>comes back so that he can get out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

138
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:33.881
<v Speaker 1>But of course it's a bit too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then UN occhio grows jackass ears</v>

139
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.790
<v Speaker 1>and he's absolutely terrified by it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

140
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.500
<v Speaker 1>He knows what's coming and the cricut </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes back and,</v>

141
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.880
<v Speaker 1>and guides them off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pleasure island.</v>

142
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.650
<v Speaker 1>And so then they end up on a cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is an island after all,</v>

143
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:53.870
<v Speaker 1>they have to jump into the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right out of this impulsive adolescent </v>

144
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.360
<v Speaker 1>hedonic playground into the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how they escape.</v>
