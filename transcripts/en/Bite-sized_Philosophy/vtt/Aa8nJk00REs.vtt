00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.770
<v Speaker 1>One of the things psychologists have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done for the last 20 years,</v>

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.550
<v Speaker 1>especially the social psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is pushed this idea of self esteem.</v>

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.950
<v Speaker 1>You should feel good about yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 1>why would you tell someone 20 that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.810
<v Speaker 1>you should feel good about who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

6
00:00:13.811 --> 00:00:14.500
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't.</v>

7
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Why should you feel good about who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are?</v>

8
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like you should feel good about who</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be.</v>

9
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.550
<v Speaker 1>That's way better because you got 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years to turn into who you could wait a </v>

10
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.550
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

11
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.250
<v Speaker 2>Are you what your accomplishments are or</v>
<v Speaker 2>you descend dividual going through this </v>

12
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.931
<v Speaker 2>journey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't think there's anything </v>

13
00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:34.671
<v Speaker 2>wrong with feeling good about who you </v>
<v Speaker 2>are as long as it's tempered by an </v>

14
00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:38.391
<v Speaker 2>understanding of potential and what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have accomplished versus what you can </v>

15
00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:39.760
<v Speaker 2>accomplish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but having confidence big,</v>

16
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:40.990
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

17
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.860
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying that people shouldn't</v>

18
00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:45.950
<v Speaker 1>have confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like often you take young people say</v>

19
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:50.951
<v Speaker 1>there are 16 to 22 and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really feeling that good about who they </v>

20
00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:54.221
<v Speaker 1>are because their life is chaotic and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder and they don't know where </v>

21
00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:54.650
<v Speaker 1>they're going and they don't know which </v>
<v Speaker 1>way is up a call,</v>

22
00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:56.530
<v Speaker 1>so that could be bad parenting card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

23
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.870
<v Speaker 2>a lot of abuse going on and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the reasons why that </v>

24
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.081
<v Speaker 2>resonates with people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This idea of be happy for you about who </v>

25
00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:06.200
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel good about who you are,</v>

26
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.470
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

27
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.670
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is it has to be stated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with precision.</v>

28
00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:10.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

29
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 1>it's like you should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should treat yourself as if you're </v>

30
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.750
<v Speaker 1>valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in potential,</v>

31
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.440
<v Speaker 1>but you should concentrate on who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should become,</v>

32
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so let's say you're miserable and </v>

33
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.700
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic and chaotic and depressed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that now,</v>

34
00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:26.050
<v Speaker 1>and you have your reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.360
<v Speaker 1>terrible parenting abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those things.</v>

36
00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:29.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

37
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.510
<v Speaker 1>you should feel good about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

38
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.900
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

39
00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:36.901
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the right message is that it's </v>

40
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:40.921
<v Speaker 1>more like you should understand how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential there is within you to set </v>

41
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:45.331
<v Speaker 1>that straight and then you should do </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you can to manifest that in </v>

42
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:47.620
<v Speaker 1>the world and it will set it straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's better than self esteem.</v>

43
00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:49.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in a crooked,</v>

44
00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:50.740
<v Speaker 1>horrible position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

45
00:01:50.741 --> 00:01:55.741
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of suffering and pain </v>

46
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:55.741
<v Speaker 1>associated with that.</v>

47
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just feel good about that </v>

48
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 1>because it's not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can do something about it.</v>

49
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>You can genuinely do something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think all the evidence suggests </v>

50
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>that that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

51
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.750
<v Speaker 1>So I'm telling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling young people,</v>

52
00:02:04.751 --> 00:02:07.390
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no matter how bad your situation</v>

53
00:02:07.391 --> 00:02:09.310
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to pretend it's okay.</v>

54
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tragic.</v>

55
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Tainted with malevolence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people really get hurt by </v>

56
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:17.050
<v Speaker 1>malevolent people like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terribly hurt.</v>

57
00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they never recover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really awful,</v>

58
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>but there's more to you than you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you stand up and face it with a </v>

59
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.300
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a,</v>

60
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.450
<v Speaker 1>with a noble vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with discipline and intent,</v>

61
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.370
<v Speaker 1>you can go far farther to overcoming it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you can imagine,</v>

62
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>and that's the principal upon which you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should predicate your behavior and I </v>

63
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.051
<v Speaker 1>think that one of the things that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really nice about being a clinical </v>

64
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:43.420
<v Speaker 1>psychologist is that this isn't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>guesswork.</v>

65
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two things in clinical psychology,</v>

66
00:02:46.481 --> 00:02:51.481
<v Speaker 1>one is truthful conversations redeemed </v>
<v Speaker 1>people because if you come to a clinical</v>

67
00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:56.890
<v Speaker 1>psychologist who's worth his salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have a truthful conversation.</v>

68
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.990
<v Speaker 1>The conversation is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

69
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with my life and here's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what caused it,</v>

70
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it takes a year to have that </v>

71
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.211
<v Speaker 1>conversation and both of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>participants are doing everything they </v>

72
00:03:09.211 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>can to lay it out properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's how it might be fixed,</v>

73
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>here's what a beneficial future might </v>
<v Speaker 1>look like.</v>

74
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.990
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a completely honest </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation if it's working well and </v>

75
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.381
<v Speaker 1>all that's happening in the conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the two people involved are </v>

76
00:03:22.381 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 1>trying to make things better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the goal.</v>

77
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can have a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will make things better.</v>

78
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know that works.</v>

79
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 1>It does make things better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then another thing we know is that,</v>

80
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say there's a bunch of things that</v>

81
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:37.741
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid of that are in your way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have some vision about who you </v>

82
00:03:37.741 --> 00:03:37.741
<v Speaker 1>want to be.</v>

83
00:03:37.741 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 1>you want to be successful in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

85
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 1>so you have to learn to talk in front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a group.</v>

86
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

87
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:48.181
<v Speaker 1>well you're afraid of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so no wonder you don't want to be </v>

88
00:03:48.181 --> 00:03:48.181
<v Speaker 1>humiliated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

89
00:03:48.181 --> 00:03:48.880
<v Speaker 1>so what do we do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

90
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:53.881
<v Speaker 1>maybe we first get you to speak in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of one person and then three people you </v>

91
00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 1>know for five minutes and then for 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

92
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>like graduated exposure to what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid of,</v>

93
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 1>voluntary graduated exposure to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid of is curative.</v>

94
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>

95
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 1>The documentation is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how people learn.</v>

96
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to,</v>

97
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.800
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell people that if you confront the </v>

98
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.231
<v Speaker 1>world forthrightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you speak the truth and you expose </v>

99
00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:17.480
<v Speaker 1>yourself courageously to those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're afraid of,</v>

100
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:22.710
<v Speaker 1>that your life will improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so will the life of people around </v>

101
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.351
<v Speaker 1>you like as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's as close to undeniable fact as </v>

102
00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 1>we've as we've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it also dovetails nicely with the </v>

103
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 1>underlying archetypal stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that heroic stories.</v>

104
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go out there,</v>

105
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.740
<v Speaker 1>find the dragon confronted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a dragon.</v>

106
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>It might eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dangerous,</v>

107
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.200
<v Speaker 1>but it's worse to cower at home and wait</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it to come and devour you.</v>

108
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Go out there confronted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the gold,</v>

109
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>share it with the community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

110
00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the oldest story of mankind.</v>
