1
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.870
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my nephew had a dream at one point,</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.860
<v Speaker 1>this little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone made a little animated thing out</v>

3
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:09.990
<v Speaker 1>of it and put it on the intranet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite cool.</v>

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.340
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was having night terrors and he ran </v>

6
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.340
<v Speaker 1>around like a little night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kai,</v>

8
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>a Connecticut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>k n I g h t night,</v>

9
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 1>and he had little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.630
<v Speaker 1>armor and a sword and he run around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>house with little hat on being the night</v>

11
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 1>and he was only like four or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he'd watched this lot of Disney </v>

12
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of movies.</v>

13
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.261
<v Speaker 1>So he kinda got the night idea was it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was at his acting that out and he was </v>

14
00:00:36.261 --> 00:00:37.510
<v Speaker 1>having these terrors at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

15
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>So He'd go to bed with his little hat </v>
<v Speaker 1>and his sword and he put them on is bad.</v>

16
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>And then at night he'd wake up </v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming.</v>

17
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>And that happened for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I went to visit,</v>

18
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I found out that this was happening and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a night terror.</v>

20
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>So the kid wakes up with night terrors </v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming but can't remember anything.</v>

21
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

22
00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:03.351
<v Speaker 1>this was happening and so it happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>one day and I was sitting with him and </v>

23
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>his family at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the breakfast table,</v>

24
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.410
<v Speaker 1>did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he have a dream?</v>

26
00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:08.490
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

27
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>I had a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

28
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>what was your dream?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

30
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

31
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:15.350
<v Speaker 1>I was out on this field and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

32
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.440
<v Speaker 1>and I was surrounded by these dwarfs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they came up to my knees and they </v>

33
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have any arms,</v>

34
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:25.911
<v Speaker 1>they had big feet and they were covered </v>
<v Speaker 1>with hair and there was a cross shaved </v>

35
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>at the top of their head and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>all greasy and they had huge beaks.</v>

36
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.230
<v Speaker 1>And everywhere I went they jumped at me </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their beaks and there was lots of </v>

37
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.861
<v Speaker 1>them and everybody was very quiet after </v>
<v Speaker 1>he said this because it was like that,</v>

38
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you're screaming at night.</v>

39
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

40
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

41
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:43.420
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

42
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he said,</v>

43
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:47.250
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the background there was a dragon</v>

44
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:51.270
<v Speaker 1>and the dragon would blow out smoke and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fire and then it would turn into these.</v>

45
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Dwarfs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like,</v>

46
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kid had a problem,</v>

47
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

48
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

49
00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>We fight off a dwarf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

50
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like plus 10 more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's life,</v>

51
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's life.</v>

52
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the Hydra.</v>

53
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>You cut off one head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven more grow.</v>

54
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:10.140
<v Speaker 1>That's life snakes everywhere and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get rid of one,</v>

55
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.410
<v Speaker 1>there'll be more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he figured that out.</v>

56
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a hell of an existential shock when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're four.</v>

57
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 1>And so he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a knight.</v>

58
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.090
<v Speaker 1>He's thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I do about these dwarfs while </v>

59
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.090
<v Speaker 1>there's too many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a dragon also.</v>

60
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

61
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>what could you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

62
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Loaded question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It implies that you could do something </v>

63
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

64
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:37.131
<v Speaker 1>he kind of knew that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why he was running around like </v>

65
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:37.131
<v Speaker 1>a night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>he kind of figured that out and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

67
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:43.281
<v Speaker 1>I get my dad and I jump up on the dragon</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I poke out both of its size with my </v>

68
00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>sword,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I go right down.</v>

69
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:46.410
<v Speaker 1>It's stomach to the place where the fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>came out,</v>

70
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.730
<v Speaker 1>the firebox and then I carve a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the firebox Oh,</v>

71
00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:52.770
<v Speaker 1>did I make a shield?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would be the end of that.</v>

72
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

73
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>good work kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you really got it right.</v>

74
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the central human story.</v>

75
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>There's the terrible unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

76
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Fire-Breathing generating trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do you do?</v>

77
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:11.701
<v Speaker 1>You confront that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you confront that and by confronting it </v>

78
00:03:11.701 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 1>you get stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the shield and that's,</v>

79
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>that's what a human being is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

80
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly right.</v>

81
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>And that was the end of his night </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrors by the way,</v>

82
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:25.201
<v Speaker 1>which seems too good to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is actually true because I </v>

83
00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:28.561
<v Speaker 1>followed up with his mother for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and that was that he catalyze that </v>

84
00:03:28.561 --> 00:03:32.521
<v Speaker 1>part of his identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He adopted the role of the mythological </v>

85
00:03:32.521 --> 00:03:34.710
<v Speaker 1>hero and that's what he needed to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>because like there was lots of drag.</v>

86
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a dragon and a bunch of gifts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

87
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you going to do about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that run?</v>

88
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.500
<v Speaker 1>That's not gonna help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

89
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.540
<v Speaker 1>if you run in a dream like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doors multiply and they get bigger </v>

90
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 1>and you get smaller as you run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's not a good.</v>

91
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>That is not a good solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people do that in their life all the</v>

92
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:57.361
<v Speaker 1>time and so the dwarves get bigger until</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're giants and they get smaller </v>

93
00:03:57.361 --> 00:04:02.251
<v Speaker 1>until there's nothing left of them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then then there's no recovery.</v>

94
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>That is not good.</v>
