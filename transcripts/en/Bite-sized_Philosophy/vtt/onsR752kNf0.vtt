1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to calculate high </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution utopia for myself,</v>

2
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:09.471
<v Speaker 1>only to have it squandered by fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I ensure the meaning I </v>

3
00:00:09.471 --> 00:00:10.410
<v Speaker 1>experienced this self determined?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>you can't because there's an arbitrary </v>
<v Speaker 1>element to existence,</v>

5
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:18.000
<v Speaker 1>so it is going to be squandered to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree by fortune,</v>

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.650
<v Speaker 1>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the point.</v>

7
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:24.651
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sit back on your laurels and wait </v>

8
00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:24.651
<v Speaker 1>for things to roll over you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what you do.</v>

9
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hero myth basically says,</v>

10
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.290
<v Speaker 1>go out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>confront the drag and get the gold.</v>

11
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Share it with the community and and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>live properly,</v>

12
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:38.520
<v Speaker 1>or it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alternative is faced the tyrant.</v>

13
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Enter the desert as a consequence </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everything falls apart.</v>

14
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Recast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

15
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.600
<v Speaker 1>find the promise land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two elements to the hero </v>

16
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>myth and you might and that's divine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the closest thing to divine that we</v>

17
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

18
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:58.701
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens if you follow the divine </v>

19
00:00:58.701 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>path and then so it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

20
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 1>everything turns out perfectly because </v>
<v Speaker 1>God is on your side.</v>

21
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

22
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what happened because things </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't turn out perfectly.</v>

23
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.080
<v Speaker 1>It's your best bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your best strategy,</v>

24
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>

25
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.480
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragons wouldn't be dragons if they </v>

26
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>couldn't eat you and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

27
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.840
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is something I found so useful </v>

28
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.361
<v Speaker 1>about the biblical stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>posts especially about the abrahamic </v>

29
00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>stories which I didn't know that well </v>
<v Speaker 1>until I lectured about them last year.</v>

30
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God calls people to the adventure of </v>

31
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.120
<v Speaker 1>their lives and so you could say in </v>
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>

32
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.060
<v Speaker 1>God is that force within you which calls</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to the adventure of your life,</v>

33
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 1>and it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get away from your family.</v>

34
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Get away from your blind and unconscious</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfort and get the hell out there in </v>

35
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.860
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

36
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.811
<v Speaker 1>God calls Abraham out from his father's </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he stayed far too long and from </v>

37
00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>his kin where it's secure and like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first thing he encounters is a famine,</v>

38
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>and then he encounters a tyranny </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabited by people who want to steal </v>

39
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you think,</v>

40
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ever happened.</v>

41
00:01:56.911 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Should have just stayed in bed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignored God obviously.</v>

42
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't how it is.</v>

43
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like we're built for struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>US human beings.</v>

44
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.140
<v Speaker 1>You're not after the bubbles of bliss </v>
<v Speaker 1>that does Tsq described in,</v>

45
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>in notes from underground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're built to contend with the world.</v>

46
00:02:13.261 --> 00:02:18.261
<v Speaker 1>We're built to contend with reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to challenge and the best way </v>

47
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:21.120
<v Speaker 1>that you can take on a challenge because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the challenge fortifies you so you don't</v>

48
00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>want to be secure.</v>

49
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.780
<v Speaker 1>You want to be strong and you get strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>by taking on optimal challenges and so </v>

50
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.071
<v Speaker 1>you lay out your destiny in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you take the slings and arrows of </v>

51
00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:33.090
<v Speaker 1>fate and you make yourself stronger </v>
<v Speaker 1>while you're doing so and you might fail</v>

52
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.140
<v Speaker 1>and fortunate might do you in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's your best bet and you know </v>

53
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.290
<v Speaker 1>people have also people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>extracted unbelievable successes out of </v>

54
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:47.190
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic failures and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying that in a naive way.</v>

55
00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:49.170
<v Speaker 1>I know perfectly well what happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

56
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.200
<v Speaker 1>You know you're doing fine in life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get cancer and then six months </v>

57
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.711
<v Speaker 1>later your debt and all the heroism in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world isn't going to save you at </v>

58
00:02:57.711 --> 00:02:58.260
<v Speaker 1>that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the point.</v>

59
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>That's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life is bounded by mortality,</v>

60
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.410
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that you don't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there and content and you develop by</v>

61
00:03:06.411 --> 00:03:11.411
<v Speaker 1>contending and you minimize the net </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of suffering in the world and </v>

62
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:11.411
<v Speaker 1>that's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

63
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>that's something to do so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's it beats laying in your basement,</v>

64
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>getting bitter and then doing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible things that bitter people do so</v>

65
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 1>you can't ensure that the meaning you </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced yourself determined,</v>

66
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:29.161
<v Speaker 1>but you can play your role to the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your ability and that will be good </v>

67
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>enough and that will be good enough.</v>

68
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.200
<v Speaker 1>That meaning the meaning that you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>find in then in that I believe is </v>

69
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>sufficient to be sustaining and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>even sustaining through the flood.</v>

70
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 1>So it isn't that you can avoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe,</v>

71
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>it's that you can prepare yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with it honorably when it arrives.</v>

72
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>That's what you've got.</v>
