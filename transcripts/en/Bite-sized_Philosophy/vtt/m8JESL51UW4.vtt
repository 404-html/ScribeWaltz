1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.450
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that the way that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortify your faith in being and in life </v>

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.111
<v Speaker 1>and your own existence isn't to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>convince yourself of the existence of a </v>

3
00:00:09.111 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>transcendent power that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in the same way that you believe</v>

4
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:14.750
<v Speaker 1>in a set of empirical facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the right approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a weak approach.</v>

6
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

7
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that the cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology that I don't think that's the</v>

8
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>right cognitive technology for that set </v>
<v Speaker 1>of problems.</v>

9
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more a technology that you use if</v>

10
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>you were trying to solve a scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

11
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.050
<v Speaker 1>It's more like it's more something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to be embedded in action rather </v>

12
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:41.391
<v Speaker 1>than in stateable belief and the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you fortify your faith in life is </v>

13
00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>to assume the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

14
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:46.400
<v Speaker 1>and then to act courageously in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to that and,</v>

15
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's tantamount to expressing your </v>

16
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Speaker 1>faith in the highest possible good.</v>

17
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.110
<v Speaker 1>It's tantamount to expressing your faith</v>
<v Speaker 1>in God and it's not a matter of stating,</v>

18
00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the existence of a </v>

19
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.290
<v Speaker 1>transcendent that daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in some sense,</v>

20
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who cares what you believe.</v>

21
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean you might and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

22
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the issue.</v>

23
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.600
<v Speaker 1>The issue it seems to me is how you act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was thinking about this intensely </v>

24
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.341
<v Speaker 1>when I was thinking about Nietzsche and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky because of course you know </v>

25
00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>that nature was the philosopher who </v>
<v Speaker 1>announced the death of God,</v>

26
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:18.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who is a great,</v>

27
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:23.721
<v Speaker 1>great critic of Christianity at vicious </v>
<v Speaker 1>critic of Institutional Christianity in </v>

28
00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>the best sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.780
<v Speaker 1>and he announced the death of God and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>said that we'd never find enough water </v>

30
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>to wash away the blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a triumphant proclamation even</v>

31
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>though it's often read that way and </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't need shoes.</v>

32
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Conclusion from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the death of God,</v>

33
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>the fact that our ethical systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to collapse.</v>

34
00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:43.650
<v Speaker 1>When the foundation was pulled out from </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath him,</v>

35
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.340
<v Speaker 1>he believed that human beings would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find their own values to create their</v>

36
00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:52.341
<v Speaker 1>own values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a problem with that because </v>

37
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:54.861
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem that this is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl young was very thorough and </v>

38
00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:58.821
<v Speaker 1>investigating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really look like people are </v>

39
00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:00.950
<v Speaker 1>capable of creating their own values </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not really capable of </v>

40
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.881
<v Speaker 1>molding yourself just any old way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be like you have a nature </v>

41
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:08.691
<v Speaker 1>that you have to contend with and so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't a matter of creating our own </v>

42
00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>values because we don't have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity.</v>

43
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Speaker 1>It might be a matter of rediscovering </v>
<v Speaker 1>those values,</v>

44
00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 1>which is what young was attempting to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

45
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

46
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>and so I think nature was actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>profoundly wrong in that,</v>

47
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.900
<v Speaker 1>in that recommendation.</v>

48
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I think he was psychologically wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

49
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>there was the Husky wrote in many ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>in parallel to Nisha and was a great </v>

50
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>influence on nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their,</v>

51
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:35.901
<v Speaker 1>their lives parallel each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To a degree that's somewhat miraculous </v>

52
00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:36.180
<v Speaker 1>in some senses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's quite uncanny.</v>

53
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Dostoevsky was obviously a literary </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure,</v>

54
00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>whether whereas nature was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosopher,</v>

55
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.990
<v Speaker 1>a literary philosopher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still have last for Dostoevsky,</v>

56
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.870
<v Speaker 1>wrestled with exactly the same problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

57
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.980
<v Speaker 1>that nature wrestled with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

58
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.070
<v Speaker 1>but he did it in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't literary manner and he has </v>

59
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.881
<v Speaker 1>this great book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brothers Karamazov and in that book </v>

60
00:02:58.881 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a hero of the book is really Lee</v>
<v Speaker 1>Osha Who's a monastic novitiate,</v>

61
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>a very good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinda not an intellect,</v>

62
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>not an intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a person of great character,</v>

63
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.490
<v Speaker 1>but he has a brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an older brother who's a great </v>

64
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.021
<v Speaker 1>intellect and and a very handsome </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldier and a brave man and like </v>

65
00:03:16.021 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Dostoyevsky's villains.</v>

66
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Ivan isn't exactly a villain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's close enough.</v>

67
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Ivan or Dostoevsky makes his villains </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily powerful.</v>

68
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 1>So if Dostoevsky's trying to work out an</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>

69
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he clothes the argument in the,</v>

70
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>in the flesh of one of his characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it's an argument he doesn't agree</v>

71
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:37.051
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he makes that character as strong </v>

72
00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:38.911
<v Speaker 1>as he possibly can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as strong and as attractive and </v>

73
00:03:38.911 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 1>intelligent as he possibly can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he let some just have outer.</v>

74
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.060
<v Speaker 1>And so Ivan is constantly attacking Lee </v>
<v Speaker 1>Osha and from every direction trying to </v>

75
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:48.240
<v Speaker 1>knock him off his perch of faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

76
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.550
<v Speaker 1>And they'll Osha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ellie,</v>

77
00:03:49.551 --> 00:03:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Osha can't address a single one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivan's criticisms and,</v>

78
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 1>and he doesn't have the intellect for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

79
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:56.040
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

80
00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 1>and Ivan has a devastating intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's devastating to him himself as well.</v>

81
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 1>What happens in the brothers Karamazov </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially is the lel.</v>

82
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Osha continues to act out his commitment</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the good,</v>

83
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:10.000
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that manner,</v>

84
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:15.001
<v Speaker 1>he is triumphant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter that he loses the </v>

85
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:15.001
<v Speaker 1>arguments because the arguments aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the point.</v>

86
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:18.430
<v Speaker 1>The arguments in some sense are aside </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue because the issue is,</v>

87
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:23.431
<v Speaker 1>and this is the existential issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue is not what you believe as if </v>

88
00:04:23.431 --> 00:04:27.781
<v Speaker 1>it's a set of facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how you conduct yourself in the </v>

89
00:04:27.781 --> 00:04:27.781
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
