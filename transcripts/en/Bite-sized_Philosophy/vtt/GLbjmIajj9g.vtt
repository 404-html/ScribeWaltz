1
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Is there a concrete example of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you,</v>

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.110
<v Speaker 1>you said you said something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not thinking of anything in </v>

3
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.110
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being entirely genuine year.</v>

4
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Is there an instance where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you feel you said something that </v>

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>appeared to be true to you at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and knowing what you know?</v>

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I was little.</v>

7
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.130
<v Speaker 2>I think I was a little dismissive of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>men going their own way because I think </v>

8
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:25.290
<v Speaker 2>I called them pathetic weasels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

9
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 2>and I had my reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My reasons were roughly speaking,</v>

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.470
<v Speaker 2>who are the men going their own way </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequently?</v>

11
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a group of people mostly on </v>

12
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.941
<v Speaker 2>the net who have had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who've been burned in their </v>

13
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:41.241
<v Speaker 2>relationships or who conceptualize </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves as having been burned in </v>

14
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:44.721
<v Speaker 2>their relationships and they believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the legal structure in particular </v>

15
00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:46.410
<v Speaker 2>in western countries is so tilted </v>
<v Speaker 2>against men,</v>

16
00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 2>particularly in family dispute </v>
<v Speaker 2>situations that end divorce settlement,</v>

17
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 2>that it's safer for men not to establish</v>
<v Speaker 2>permanent relationships with women,</v>

18
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 2>not to cohabit with them ever and there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are large movement now.</v>

19
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 2>How large they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

20
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:05.841
<v Speaker 2>but they're large enough and they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I would regard as an undue </v>

21
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:11.271
<v Speaker 2>influence over relatively bitter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>resentful young men who haven't had </v>

22
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:16.821
<v Speaker 2>great success in the dating market and </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are looking for a rationale to write</v>

23
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:23.121
<v Speaker 2>off all women because they are so hurt </v>
<v Speaker 2>by their continual rejection and that is</v>

24
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:28.251
<v Speaker 2>not good for those young men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the reason that I disparaged the </v>

25
00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 2>men going their own way was because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had seen the pernicious effect.</v>

26
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.860
<v Speaker 2>These are often older guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pernicious effect of their world.</v>

27
00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:41.871
<v Speaker 2>Weary philosophy on young men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now these guys think that they're just </v>

28
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 2>warning them and they are warning them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not just warning them.</v>

29
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.820
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reason I really regret calling them </v>

30
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.820
<v Speaker 2>pathetic weasels is because they also </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a point.</v>

31
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.920
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that the court systems are </v>
<v Speaker 2>staggeringly anti male,</v>

32
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 2>absurdly horribly anti male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen my own clients,</v>

33
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 2>some of them who are really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really decent,</v>

34
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 2>hardworking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>family oriented people demolished by the</v>

35
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:11.211
<v Speaker 2>court systems and and so the men going </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own way have a point.</v>

36
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm sorry that I called them </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathetic weasels,</v>

37
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I outlined my reasons and so yes,</v>

38
00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:25.341
<v Speaker 2>I do regret that I have to be careful </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I do have a satirical,</v>

39
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 2>dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>satirical sense of humor and I can outer</v>

40
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.260
<v Speaker 2>epithets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say for the sake of punctuating </v>

41
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.140
<v Speaker 2>appoint well simultaneously forgetting </v>
<v Speaker 2>that 150,000</v>

42
00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:43.930
<v Speaker 2>people will listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

43
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.080
<v Speaker 2>So I regret that.</v>
