1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.650
<v Speaker 1>And the psychoanalyst,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.870
<v Speaker 1>err too much on the side of the subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tend to think that too much of you </v>

3
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.870
<v Speaker 1>is inside of you and too little of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of you.</v>

4
00:00:10.871 --> 00:00:15.871
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason I believe that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of my clinical experience.</v>

5
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.050
<v Speaker 1>I love the psychoanalyst Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're brilliant,</v>

6
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>they're brilliant or deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They grapple with real problems like </v>

7
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 1>with the problems when people have real </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that I mean profound problems.</v>

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.900
<v Speaker 1>They're really profound moral problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>or problems of good and evil really.</v>

9
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are things going on in their </v>

10
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.150
<v Speaker 1>family that are so terrible that well </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are,</v>

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.980
<v Speaker 1>there are sometimes fatal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>lie upon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lie upon,</v>

13
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:47.820
<v Speaker 1>lie upon lie for decades and decades and</v>
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>

14
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.990
<v Speaker 1>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not exactly inside them.</v>

15
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.250
<v Speaker 1>It's out there in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And lots of the people that I see,</v>

16
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.490
<v Speaker 1>very famous critic of psychology,</v>

17
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.810
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I probably will criticize the </v>

18
00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:18.410
<v Speaker 1>practice of psychology quite effectively</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the believe in the early sixties.</v>

19
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.770
<v Speaker 1>The Myth of mental illness by Thomas </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sad,</v>

20
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>zed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a s zed.</v>

21
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.110
<v Speaker 1>It's classic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should read it if you're interested </v>

22
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.110
<v Speaker 1>in psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read it like it's.</v>

23
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a classic and he basically said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people have problems in living.</v>

24
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:38.150
<v Speaker 1>They don't have psychological problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I've experienced,</v>

25
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.300
<v Speaker 1>despite my love for the psychoanalysts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very frequently what I'm doing as a </v>

26
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.360
<v Speaker 1>therapist is helping people have a life </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would work.</v>

27
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can parameterize that.</v>

28
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you need?</v>

29
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.930
<v Speaker 1>How about some friends that people kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like that?</v>

30
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.960
<v Speaker 1>How about an intimate relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that you can trust that maybe </v>

31
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970
<v Speaker 1>has a future?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be good.</v>

32
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.360
<v Speaker 1>How about a career that puts you in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy somewhere so at </v>

33
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.860
<v Speaker 1>least you've got some possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rising,</v>

34
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.870
<v Speaker 1>some possibility of stabilizing yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a schedule and a routine because no </v>

35
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:16.010
<v Speaker 1>one can live without a routine.</v>

36
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.920
<v Speaker 1>You just forget that if you guys don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a routine,</v>

37
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.640
<v Speaker 1>I would recommend you get one going </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you cannot be mentally healthy </v>

38
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.441
<v Speaker 1>without a routine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to pick a time to get up </v>

39
00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:32.800
<v Speaker 1>whatever time you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pick one and stick to it because </v>

40
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.981
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you disregulate your circadian</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhythms and they regulate your mood and </v>

41
00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:38.870
<v Speaker 1>eat something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the morning.</v>

42
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.320
<v Speaker 1>I had lots of clients who've that </v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety disorders,</v>

43
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.780
<v Speaker 1>hired one client who was literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>starving,</v>

44
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.590
<v Speaker 1>very smart girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was very little that she liked.</v>

45
00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:51.500
<v Speaker 1>She kind of tried to subsist on like </v>
<v Speaker 1>half a cup of rice a day.</v>

46
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.170
<v Speaker 1>She came to me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no energy.</v>

47
00:02:54.171 --> 00:02:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I come home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I want to do is watch the same movie</v>

48
00:02:56.781 --> 00:02:57.640
<v Speaker 1>over and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

49
00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that weird?</v>

50
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

51
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how hard you work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

52
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a little weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

53
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>It's familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking for comfort.</v>

54
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.450
<v Speaker 1>So I did an analysis of her diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like three quarters of a cup of </v>

55
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're starving,</v>

56
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 1>eat something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.140
<v Speaker 1>you'll feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she modified her diet and you're all </v>

58
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.791
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anxiety went away and she had some </v>

59
00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:28.791
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

60
00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:29.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to eat.</v>

61
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.140
<v Speaker 1>So schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing,</v>

62
00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:35.190
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brain will.</v>

63
00:03:35.191 --> 00:03:40.191
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will stabilize your nervous system </v>

64
00:03:40.191 --> 00:03:40.380
<v Speaker 1>where there's a bit of a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing.</v>

65
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.680
<v Speaker 1>You need a career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need something productive to do with</v>

66
00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:48.681
<v Speaker 1>your time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to regulate your use of drugs </v>

67
00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:52.401
<v Speaker 1>and alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most particularly alcohol because that </v>

68
00:03:52.401 --> 00:03:52.401
<v Speaker 1>does even a lot of people.</v>

69
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>You need a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the family,</v>

70
00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>you have your parents and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be nice if you all got along.</v>

71
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:05.581
<v Speaker 1>You could work on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing to work on and then </v>

72
00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:08.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably need children at some </v>

73
00:04:08.101 --> 00:04:08.101
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's life.</v>

74
00:04:08.101 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>That's what life is and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>missing,</v>

75
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may have a good reason to not be </v>

76
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>operating on one of those dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not mandatory,</v>

77
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you that if you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>operating reasonably well on four,</v>

78
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:27.691
<v Speaker 1>I think I mentioned six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not operating reasonably well </v>

79
00:04:27.691 --> 00:04:30.391
<v Speaker 1>on at least three of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way you're going to be </v>

80
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.520
<v Speaker 1>psychologically thriving and that's more</v>
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic in some sense than </v>

81
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:37.050
<v Speaker 1>psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

82
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Human beings have a nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's things we need and if we have </v>

83
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 1>them well that's good and if we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have them well then we feel the lack.</v>

84
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.150
<v Speaker 1>So behaviorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral psychologists concentrate a </v>

85
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 1>lot more on that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

86
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 1>it's practical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like strategizing.</v>

87
00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Make a career plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to negotiate because </v>

88
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.720
<v Speaker 1>that's bloody important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figuring out how to say what you need,</v>

89
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to tell the truth to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

90
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.920
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to listen to your partner</v>
<v Speaker 1>in particular because if you listen to </v>

91
00:05:10.421 --> 00:05:15.421
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will actually tell you what they </v>

92
00:05:15.421 --> 00:05:16.540
<v Speaker 1>want and sometimes you can give it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and maybe they'll return the favor.</v>

93
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:19.120
<v Speaker 1>And if you practice that for like 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

94
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 1>well then maybe you're constantly giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other what you want.</v>

95
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Well Hooray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be good.</v>

96
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.390
<v Speaker 1>And then there's two of you under both </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances and it's better to have </v>

97
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>two brains than one because people think</v>
<v Speaker 1>differently because of their temperament</v>

98
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:40.110
<v Speaker 1>mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the negotiation is where the </v>

99
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.850
<v Speaker 1>wisdom arises and it's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>

100
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.870
<v Speaker 1>the psychological transformation that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>attendant on an intimate relationship,</v>

101
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>and one of the fundamental purposes of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm intimate relationship.</v>
