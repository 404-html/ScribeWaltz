1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.790
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense there is a call to </v>
<v Speaker 1>action within people now you know,</v>

2
00:00:04.791 --> 00:00:07.490
<v Speaker 1>in any sort of quest story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Hobbit,</v>

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.160
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the Lord of the rings,</v>

4
00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:11.450
<v Speaker 1>for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.360
<v Speaker 1>the story always starts with a call to </v>
<v Speaker 1>action,</v>

6
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some reason or another,</v>

7
00:00:16.251 --> 00:00:18.380
<v Speaker 1>the little hobbit character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is,</v>

8
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hobbits live in this little </v>

9
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.121
<v Speaker 1>protected place and they're not very big</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not very smart and they </v>

10
00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:25.660
<v Speaker 1>don't know about the wide world beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

11
00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:28.220
<v Speaker 1>where the great forces of good and evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>are at combat.</v>

12
00:00:28.221 --> 00:00:32.570
<v Speaker 1>And one hobbit who's a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventurous than the rest gets called to</v>

13
00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:34.850
<v Speaker 1>act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets called upon to act.</v>

14
00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:37.870
<v Speaker 1>And in the Harvard stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usually the wizard who manages it,</v>

15
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a magical figure of some sort,</v>

16
00:00:39.911 --> 00:00:44.480
<v Speaker 1>becomes extraordinarily wise and </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily old who might as well be</v>

17
00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:46.520
<v Speaker 1>gone for all intents and purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who says,</v>

18
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:51.521
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time for you to go and become a </v>

19
00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:51.521
<v Speaker 1>thief.</v>

20
00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:51.521
<v Speaker 1>Will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens in the Hobbit,</v>

21
00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:55.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because very weird thing because </v>

22
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.120
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's Frodo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

23
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Photos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hobbit in,</v>

24
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>in the Hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Bilbo is the hobbit and the Lord of </v>

25
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>the rings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I remembered the other way around.</v>

26
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Bilbo is the poverty and the hobbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine,</v>

27
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.400
<v Speaker 1>Bilbo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

28
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.190
<v Speaker 1>so bill will gets called to action and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna go.</v>

29
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.880
<v Speaker 1>He's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go find a dragon while the dragon is the</v>

30
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:18.881
<v Speaker 1>same thing that swallowed Jonah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same story and the Jew and the </v>

31
00:01:18.881 --> 00:01:19.790
<v Speaker 1>dragon has a treasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a weird thing.</v>

32
00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:21.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's up with dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

33
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>What do they hoard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Virgins.</v>

34
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.330
<v Speaker 1>That's the St George Story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

35
00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:31.331
<v Speaker 1>very old story or goal and that's weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior for a predatory lizard,</v>

36
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you accept that without any problem.</v>

37
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:39.081
<v Speaker 1>Of course in dragon lives underground in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big mountain that was excavated by </v>

38
00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:39.081
<v Speaker 1>doors and sits on a treasure.</v>

39
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like we go to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have any problem with that </v>

40
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.200
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

41
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.360
<v Speaker 1>why fate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean really,</v>

42
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.270
<v Speaker 1>you really believe that announcer as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well?</v>

43
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Well enough to read the damn book and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the.</v>

44
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people went and watched the </v>

45
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Lord of the Rings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people?</v>

46
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.590
<v Speaker 1>And think about it worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much money did a Harry Potter </v>

47
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.190
<v Speaker 1>generate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

48
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:06.191
<v Speaker 1>I bet Harry Potter generated more money </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the remaining steel mills in </v>

49
00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:11.201
<v Speaker 1>Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you calculated it across the amount </v>

50
00:02:11.201 --> 00:02:13.040
<v Speaker 1>of time since those stories emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

51
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.570
<v Speaker 1>So of course there's a lizard in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory lizard and Harry Potter too.</v>

52
00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:22.571
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that skitters around </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath hogwarts and turns you to </v>

53
00:02:22.571 --> 00:02:22.571
<v Speaker 1>stone with the glance of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I owe.</v>

54
00:02:22.571 --> 00:02:27.070
<v Speaker 1>And does that Lizard Hoard vergence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

55
00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:32.071
<v Speaker 1>what's the name of the woman that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The girl that he kidnaps Jenny.</v>

56
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

57
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.560
<v Speaker 1>What's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jenny from Virginia,</v>

58
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.380
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

59
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's Harry's first month interest and </v>

60
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.670
<v Speaker 1>he rescues her from the damn snake and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he gets parallels.</v>

61
00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Won't paralyze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't while he's doing it.</v>

62
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.700
<v Speaker 1>What rescue is Harry?</v>

63
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Phoenix?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phoenix.</v>

64
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the six bites Harry.</v>

65
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>And so he's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Phoenix comes along.</v>

66
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Who owns the Phoenix?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dumbledore.</v>

67
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

68
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>What is the Phoenix do cries and cries </v>
<v Speaker 1>into Harry's wounds.</v>

69
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what happens then?</v>

70
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:17.911
<v Speaker 1>What happens to Harry?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He comes back to life to read his death </v>

71
00:03:17.911 --> 00:03:21.091
<v Speaker 1>and Resurrection Story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thing that's willing to die and </v>

72
00:03:21.091 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>resurrect is the thing that gets the </v>
<v Speaker 1>virgin from the snake.</v>

73
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that make sense?</v>

74
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think it makes sense even though you</v>

75
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:34.051
<v Speaker 1>don't really know why it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens to the what adds </v>

76
00:03:34.051 --> 00:03:37.141
<v Speaker 1>to the Phoenix after does that Burns </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself up into in a puff of flame and is</v>

77
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:41.500
<v Speaker 1>reborn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the story told twice.</v>

78
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:46.501
<v Speaker 1>The thing that dies in is reborn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the thing that conquers the </v>

79
00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 1>serpentine and rescues the feminine </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

80
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>So it's not gold in that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>

81
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>It's the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always the same story.</v>

82
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you don't hear that story,</v>

83
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:04.441
<v Speaker 1>like when your culture is it providing </v>
<v Speaker 1>you with rich stories of that sort that </v>

84
00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 1>are derived directly from your </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>

85
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Somebody like an unemployed welfare </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother in Britain has it popped up full </v>

86
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:15.601
<v Speaker 1>fledged into her brilliant imagination </v>
<v Speaker 1>and lays out seven books and makes </v>

87
00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 1>herself more money than the queen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

88
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

89
00:04:17.891 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a cinderella story.</v>

90
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a bloody amazing story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's all those books and all</v>

91
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 1>those kids learn to read because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

92
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:29.581
<v Speaker 1>And then there's all those movies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody goes and sees them and no one </v>

93
00:04:29.581 --> 00:04:32.611
<v Speaker 1>notices that they don't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell they're doing while they're doing </v>

94
00:04:32.611 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it follows the same old story.</v>
