00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell,</v>

2
00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.910
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you these attempts to shut </v>
<v Speaker 1>people down or being made because you </v>

3
00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:15.351
<v Speaker 1>need to know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as far as I've been able to </v>

4
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:20.541
<v Speaker 1>determine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of protest is an expression of</v>

5
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>a philosophy that's grounded partly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism,</v>

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.900
<v Speaker 1>partly in Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The postmodern element is basically </v>

7
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.431
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no such genuine individual </v>

8
00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:38.691
<v Speaker 1>identity group identity and you liked it</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not only have the interests of your </v>

9
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:45.111
<v Speaker 1>group and the whole world is nothing but</v>
<v Speaker 1>a battle ground between groups of </v>

10
00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.310
<v Speaker 1>different interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no dialogue,</v>

11
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.430
<v Speaker 1>there's no possibility of parking </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the groups.</v>

12
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.720
<v Speaker 1>It's just a power stage where combat has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take place and so the reason that </v>

13
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.970
<v Speaker 1>speakers with whom the radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists tend the is to degree or </v>

14
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.921
<v Speaker 1>denied a passport because those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>do not believe from the philosophical </v>

15
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dialogue can bring consensus and all</v>

16
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:14.480
<v Speaker 1>that's left if you forgo that particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>principle is,</v>

17
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>and this is only where it starts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the fuck is that,</v>

18
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>that you're all pretty damn civilized </v>
<v Speaker 1>and thank God for that.</v>

19
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Because if there were enough fools in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crowd,</v>

20
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>especially those who are intent on </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>

21
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>this would turn out very differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do not want to go down that pathway.</v>

22
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've been down that pathway many,</v>

23
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:38.760
<v Speaker 1>many times.</v>

24
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.040
<v Speaker 1>I would certainly not conforming to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consensus that was against my belief </v>

25
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.020
<v Speaker 1>merely because it was a consensus in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>group is wrong.</v>

26
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 1>The question was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was a consensus against my </v>

27
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:57.820
<v Speaker 1>beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are your goals with them?</v>

28
00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>And answer would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

29
00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:02.120
<v Speaker 1>first it would depend on what my </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience said.</v>

30
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.990
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assume that the consensus is correct.</v>

31
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.560
<v Speaker 1>The Nazis had a consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

32
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>The end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joel has a conscience and you have to </v>

33
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.671
<v Speaker 1>know when the group is made a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In which case what's the maximum?</v>

34
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.700
<v Speaker 2>Talked a lot in your personality closet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very confronting your shadow and </v>

35
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.410
<v Speaker 2>generating your shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

36
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.460
<v Speaker 2>do you find that people who care less </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what other people think and care </v>

37
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.731
<v Speaker 2>more about their conscience have </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrated their shadow maybe more than </v>

38
00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:50.850
<v Speaker 2>people who care more about others?</v>

39
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Can you hear me at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a question,</v>

40
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>the question was stabbing from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality class are willing to abide </v>

41
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:13.051
<v Speaker 1>by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are those who've been to braided </v>

42
00:03:13.051 --> 00:03:15.950
<v Speaker 1>their shadow and I would say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have to be a bit of a </v>

43
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>monster to stand up to the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

44
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 1>If you're too concerned with people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and if you're to avoid conflict,</v>

45
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.710
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to cave to pressure </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't want to do that because if</v>

46
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>you let people stop you from moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

47
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.410
<v Speaker 1>you just end up being something and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're someone who's got no life in you </v>

48
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 1>and that's no good for you have to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>tough,</v>

49
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 1>but you have to give tough in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's controlled,</v>

50
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be controlled because </v>

51
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.771
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you're the puppet of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst impulses and that's a terrible </v>

52
00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>thing to be.</v>
