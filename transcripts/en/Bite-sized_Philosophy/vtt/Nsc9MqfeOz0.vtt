00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Peterson,</v>

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.670
<v Speaker 1>I've been wanting to ask you this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.830
<v Speaker 1>for a while now since I started watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>your lectures.</v>

4
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after I started reading a Nietzsche's </v>

5
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.710
<v Speaker 1>beyond good and evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came upon a paragraph in his chapter </v>

6
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:21.441
<v Speaker 1>on scholars that really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bothered me and it's actually </v>

7
00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:21.441
<v Speaker 1>bothers me to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.310
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he talked about this kind of person,</v>

9
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>like they were just a mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they stretched,</v>

10
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:31.821
<v Speaker 1>he said every part of their skin </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically to allow every new piece of </v>

11
00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:35.871
<v Speaker 1>information that they took on and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>all they ever were was just an </v>

12
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:40.191
<v Speaker 1>instrument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just a mirror reflecting what </v>

13
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>they had learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never actually having generated anything</v>

14
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:44.130
<v Speaker 1>on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's bothered me because I feel like</v>

15
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:46.330
<v Speaker 1>in a way sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

16
00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:51.331
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impacted my identity a lot because </v>

17
00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:53.811
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you supposed to create </v>

18
00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:53.811
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:53.811
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

20
00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:54.440
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's okay that,</v>

21
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 2>that's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

22
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 2>nature is often clashed with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>existentialists right?</v>

23
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:04.491
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the tenants of existential</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there's two real tenants of </v>

24
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 2>existentialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more,</v>

25
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:10.380
<v Speaker 2>but obviously we're over simplifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one is that life is a problem.</v>

26
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 2>It isn't because there's something wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>with you.</v>

27
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.990
<v Speaker 2>It's that life is a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so that's often contrasted with the </v>

28
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.790
<v Speaker 2>Friday and view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that if you have a problem,</v>

29
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 2>it's because something went wrong during</v>
<v Speaker 2>your development.</v>

30
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.350
<v Speaker 2>The existentialist said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

31
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like life is a problem.</v>

32
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:33.441
<v Speaker 2>Make no mistake about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that the purpose of</v>

33
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.480
<v Speaker 2>the purpose of scholarship is in some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense to solve that problem and so for </v>

34
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 2>Nisha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he said,</v>

35
00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:54.381
<v Speaker 2>all truths are bloody truth to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what he meant by that was that if an</v>

36
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:59.511
<v Speaker 2>idea didn't incarnate itself in you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>transform your perceptions and your </v>

37
00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:04.641
<v Speaker 2>actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you were merely possessed by the </v>

38
00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:07.341
<v Speaker 2>idea you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're merely a spokesperson for the </v>

39
00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:07.341
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or You could say that the idea possessed</v>

40
00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a puppet for the idea.</v>

41
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 2>It's not you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the idea is in you and it has you.</v>

42
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.430
<v Speaker 2>You haven't taken the idea and </v>
<v Speaker 2>incorporated with you and made it part </v>

43
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.821
<v Speaker 2>of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's a romanticism that's </v>

44
00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:22.821
<v Speaker 2>associated with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

45
00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:27.351
<v Speaker 2>That's the passionate scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The person for whom ideas are not </v>

46
00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:27.351
<v Speaker 2>merely,</v>

47
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 2>they're not merely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would you call abstracted </v>

48
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 2>representations that can be tossed about</v>
<v Speaker 2>as if they're commodities.</v>

49
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.020
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

50
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.410
<v Speaker 2>they're more like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more like personalities.</v>

51
00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:46.411
<v Speaker 2>That might be another way of thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and so if you're,</v>

52
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.760
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if those ideas are compelling,</v>

53
00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:53.761
<v Speaker 2>then you don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing I learned along time ago and I</v>

54
00:02:54.251 --> 00:02:58.180
<v Speaker 2>think this is probably relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know when I was a kid I liked to argue</v>

55
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 2>and I like to win arguments or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

56
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.510
<v Speaker 2>or lose them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I like winning them a lot </v>

57
00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.581
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't really mind so much what </v>

58
00:03:08.581 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 2>the content of the argument was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

59
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:14.161
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could engage in it like a sparring </v>

60
00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 2>match and it was in some sense to </v>
<v Speaker 2>establish dominance,</v>

61
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To establish intellectual dominance.</v>

62
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.110
<v Speaker 2>I quit doing that when I was in my mid </v>
<v Speaker 2>twenties because I thought that that was</v>

63
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 2>too shallow and approach to the ideas.</v>

64
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not commodities of that sort.</v>

65
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.710
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have tendrils that reached down </v>

66
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 2>into the living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the right way to think about it.</v>

67
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 2>And so nature's criticism of scholars </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he did this a lot,</v>

68
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.330
<v Speaker 2>was that they were bloodless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

69
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.460
<v Speaker 2>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were full of performative </v>

70
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.460
<v Speaker 2>contradictions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

71
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.141
<v Speaker 2>They'd say one thing and do another </v>
<v Speaker 2>because their intellect was completely </v>

72
00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 2>dissociated from their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from their actions.</v>

73
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.790
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

74
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.880
<v Speaker 2>he thought that was a very bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's a good </v>

75
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 2>criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is a bad idea.</v>

76
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 2>I also think it makes for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily boring lecturer,</v>

77
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you can tell if you're listening</v>

78
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:12.241
<v Speaker 2>to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether the ideas that you're hearing </v>

79
00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 2>are merely being passed through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person as if they're being memorized,</v>

80
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:18.601
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whether they're part of the dynamic </v>

81
00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 2>core of the person and if they're part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the dynamic core of the person,</v>

82
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 2>then they're almost always engaging in </v>
<v Speaker 2>gripping.</v>

83
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 2>And so he wasn't a fan of bloodless </v>
<v Speaker 2>scholars.</v>

84
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's correct because one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things that I see,</v>

85
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.360
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good idea to have ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>possess you unless you know what the </v>

86
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:41.611
<v Speaker 2>idea is that we're up to and lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are possessed by ideas rather </v>

87
00:04:41.611 --> 00:04:46.531
<v Speaker 2>than possessing them and that what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>means is they haven't taken the ideas </v>

88
00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:47.230
<v Speaker 2>and integrated them into their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

89
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.920
<v Speaker 2>They haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like an incarnation in a sense.</v>

90
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:55.921
<v Speaker 2>They have an incarnated the ideas in </v>
<v Speaker 2>embodied form and so they're incomplete.</v>

91
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nisha also in thus spake Zarathustra.</v>

92
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 2>When Xero booster comes down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain,</v>

93
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 2>he sees a bunch of people gathered </v>
<v Speaker 2>around a famous individual,</v>

94
00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe a scholar but doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>really matter.</v>

95
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.880
<v Speaker 2>And when zero theaster goes and looks at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the personality,</v>

96
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 2>season's a little tiny midget with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic ear.</v>

97
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 2>And so he's a hyper specialist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

98
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.830
<v Speaker 2>And so he has a pretty impressive ear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's only this big.</v>

99
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.100
<v Speaker 2>And that was niches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagistic commentary on the danger of </v>

100
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.431
<v Speaker 2>hyper specialization and also on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>danger of adulation for hyper </v>

101
00:05:29.431 --> 00:05:33.481
<v Speaker 2>specialization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because he thought about it as a </v>

102
00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 2>kind of deformity now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature was a pretty harsh guy,</v>

103
00:05:35.231 --> 00:05:40.231
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he did address the issue of the </v>

104
00:05:40.811 --> 00:05:45.811
<v Speaker 2>relationship between intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and action because for Nicha,</v>

105
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 2>those things are not to be separated in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sense.</v>

106
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe,</v>

107
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it bothered you,</v>

108
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>like it's hard to say why it bothered </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

109
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 2>It might have bothered you because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of undermine the idea of scholar.</v>

110
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.540
<v Speaker 2>But the other possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this isn't an accusation because </v>

111
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.540
<v Speaker 2>obviously I don't know anything about </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

112
00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.400
<v Speaker 2>but it might also be that it struck a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chord,</v>

113
00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:14.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that maybe you were doubtful or </v>

114
00:06:14.401 --> 00:06:17.561
<v Speaker 2>questioning how tightly associated your </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual endeavor was with your </v>

115
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 2>actual character and your practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's another possibility.</v>

116
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:31.241
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a really good thing to think </v>

117
00:06:31.241 --> 00:06:31.700
<v Speaker 2>about because generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that integration is very much lacking.</v>

118
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.120
<v Speaker 2>People are a lot smarter and fluid with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their ideas that they are ethical and </v>

119
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.700
<v Speaker 2>consistent and characterized by </v>
<v Speaker 2>integrity.</v>

120
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.690
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
