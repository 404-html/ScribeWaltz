1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.560
<v Speaker 1>And I want to read you something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature wrote.</v>

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.800
<v Speaker 1>It's perhaps the most famous thing he </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever said,</v>

3
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.110
<v Speaker 1>although it's almost entirely taken out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of context and misquoted,</v>

4
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.090
<v Speaker 1>and if not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ms dot quartered,</v>

5
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.100
<v Speaker 1>at least misunderstood because nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>was one of these strange people who was </v>

6
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.560
<v Speaker 1>capable of living 50 or even 100 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the future,</v>

7
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>and although he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is generally regarded as an enemy of </v>

8
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.791
<v Speaker 1>Christianity and superstition and was </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly an unbelievably outspoken </v>

9
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:30.931
<v Speaker 1>opponent of Christian traditionalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also knew that if you let the old </v>

10
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:36.001
<v Speaker 1>gods die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that blood would flood </v>

11
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.320
<v Speaker 1>the land was virtually 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me read you what he wrote.</v>

12
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Have you not heard of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mad Man who lit a lantern in the bright </v>

13
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.730
<v Speaker 1>morning hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ran to the market place and cried </v>

14
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.441
<v Speaker 1>incessantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I seek God as many of those who do not </v>

15
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:54.670
<v Speaker 1>believe in God were standing around just</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he provoked.</v>

16
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.510
<v Speaker 1>Must much laughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did he get lost?</v>

17
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Speaker 1>Said one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he lose his way like a child said </v>

18
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.150
<v Speaker 1>another or is he hiding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he afraid of us?</v>

19
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Has he gone on a voyage or immigrated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the yelled and laughed.</v>

20
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.370
<v Speaker 1>The Madman jumped into their midst and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pierced them with his glances.</v>

21
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Where there is God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he cried.</v>

22
00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:16.360
<v Speaker 1>I shall tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have killed him.</v>

23
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.270
<v Speaker 1>You and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of us are as murderers,</v>

24
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.950
<v Speaker 1>but how have we done this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How were we able to drink up the sea?</v>

25
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire horizon?</v>

26
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>What did we do when we unchained this </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth from its sun weather?</v>

27
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Is it moving now with or are we moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>now way from all sons?</v>

28
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Are we not plunging continuously </v>
<v Speaker 1>backwards,</v>

29
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.210
<v Speaker 1>sideward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward in all directions?</v>

30
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Is there any opera down left?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we not straying as though through an</v>

31
00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:53.560
<v Speaker 1>infinite nothing?</v>

32
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Do we not feel the breath of empty </v>
<v Speaker 1>space?</v>

33
00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Has it not become colder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not night and more night coming on </v>

34
00:02:01.691 --> 00:02:05.710
<v Speaker 1>all the while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Must not lanterns be lit in the morning.</v>

35
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Do we not hear anything yet of the noise</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the grave diggers who are burying </v>

36
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.301
<v Speaker 1>God?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we not smell anything yet of God's </v>

37
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.170
<v Speaker 1>decomposition?</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's to decompose.</v>

38
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.080
<v Speaker 1>God is dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God remains dead.</v>

39
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.830
<v Speaker 1>We have killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How shall we,</v>

40
00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:27.460
<v Speaker 1>the murderer of all murderers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfort ourselves?</v>

41
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.970
<v Speaker 1>What was holiest and most powerful of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that the world has yet owned,</v>

42
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.440
<v Speaker 1>has bled to death under our knives?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who will wipe this blood office?</v>

43
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.560
<v Speaker 1>What water is there for us to clean </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves?</v>

44
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>What festivals of Atonement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sacred game show we have to invent </v>

45
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.240
<v Speaker 1>is not the greatness of this deed too </v>
<v Speaker 1>great for us?</v>

46
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Must we not ourselves become God simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>to seem worthy of it?</v>

47
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can tell,</v>

48
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.470
<v Speaker 1>that's a much different notion from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>casual God is dead quotation that's most</v>

49
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:06.510
<v Speaker 1>generally associated with nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

50
00:03:06.511 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>what is he saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he's saying?</v>

51
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:13.171
<v Speaker 1>Something like this system like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity or any system that's Qa,</v>

52
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 1>that's oriented the society for </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of years,</v>

53
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.700
<v Speaker 1>can't simply be eradicated by a casual </v>
<v Speaker 1>gesture,</v>

54
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>without consequences in suing and its </v>
<v Speaker 1>aftermath.</v>

55
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>What consequences will need you to says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 1>we'll no longer know up from down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does he mean by that?</v>

57
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Metaphorically?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Up.</v>

58
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 1>That's where you're headed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right and down.</v>

59
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:47.371
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want to stay away from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you eradicate the most </v>

60
00:03:47.371 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>fundamental presuppositions of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

61
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>of values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there is no up and there is no down</v>

62
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 1>and then where are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>

63
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not so easy.</v>

64
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not so easy to say having not </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily ever been in that position.</v>

65
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 1>What is your life like when you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know up from down?</v>

66
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:07.891
<v Speaker 1>Is it merely neutral is merely no value </v>
<v Speaker 1>left or could it possibly be the case </v>

67
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>that if up and down and both being </v>
<v Speaker 1>eradicated,</v>

68
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:15.901
<v Speaker 1>that the place that you're left in is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something much more akin to a permanent </v>

69
00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:19.981
<v Speaker 1>state of suffering because maybe it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>only the case that the constant capacity</v>

70
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:24.850
<v Speaker 1>to thrive for up in being enough that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you believe in.</v>

71
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 1>The constant striving for up is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes your life bearable to you,</v>

72
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:30.490
<v Speaker 1>and if you lost the sense of up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

73
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.600
<v Speaker 1>the place that you would end up would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so much neutral as terrible.</v>

74
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have any belief system at all,</v>

75
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:42.421
<v Speaker 1>you do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say you're an advocate of </v>

76
00:04:42.421 --> 00:04:44.830
<v Speaker 1>leftwing politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You take a pro environmental stance or </v>

77
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.480
<v Speaker 1>an anti corporate stance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a relatively common thing to do</v>

78
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>among undergraduates.</v>

79
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 1>What do you do when you hold that belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>system?</v>

80
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>You view the world as it lays itself out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you explained the manner in which it</v>

81
00:04:56.141 --> 00:05:01.141
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself in terms of the axioms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that belief system and you may know </v>

82
00:05:01.141 --> 00:05:05.700
<v Speaker 1>that you can do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell a credible story about why </v>

83
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.381
<v Speaker 1>the world is the way it is by adopting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say an anti corporate perspective </v>

84
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.630
<v Speaker 1>because there are all sorts of terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about the world that are a </v>

85
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.880
<v Speaker 1>consequence say of corporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>maneuvering,</v>

86
00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.870
<v Speaker 1>and you might also say that and Piaget </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say this,</v>

87
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.880
<v Speaker 1>that it's a necessary developmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage to acquire allegiance to a given </v>

88
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:27.880
<v Speaker 1>belief system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

89
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any APP is better than none.</v>

90
00:05:30.251 --> 00:05:35.251
<v Speaker 1>That might be the first observation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even if your belief system is </v>

91
00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:39.571
<v Speaker 1>relatively insufficient and easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenged on intellectual grounds and </v>

92
00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:42.841
<v Speaker 1>perhaps not very complete anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it does lay out a moral </v>

93
00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:43.330
<v Speaker 1>structure for you and tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for me,</v>

94
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:44.680
<v Speaker 1>evil and right from wrong.</v>

95
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.870
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a plus.</v>

96
00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:51.871
<v Speaker 1>That's an advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's relative intellectual weakness </v>

97
00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:55.770
<v Speaker 1>and it's incoherence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming it is incoherent to some </v>

98
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:56.470
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a flaw,</v>

99
00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.710
<v Speaker 1>but that mean that the effort to </v>
<v Speaker 1>establish a system like that is </v>

100
00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.750
<v Speaker 1>worthless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's worthwhile and need just said,</v>

101
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.060
<v Speaker 1>say with regards to Christianity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

102
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

103
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.510
<v Speaker 1>the errors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual and moral of Institutional </v>

104
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Christianity are essentially beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>count,</v>

105
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>but there's one thing you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>

106
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.780
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in ordering of that sort is necessary </v>

107
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.080
<v Speaker 1>because the alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is always hidden from you in so </v>

108
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.591
<v Speaker 1>far as you're inside a moral system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alternative as far worse chaos </v>

109
00:06:32.591 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 1>that's worse.</v>
