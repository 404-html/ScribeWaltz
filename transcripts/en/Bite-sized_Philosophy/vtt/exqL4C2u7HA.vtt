00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.930
<v Speaker 1>When you claims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2
00:00:02.931 --> 00:00:07.931
<v Speaker 1>that you throw the baby out with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bathwater when you're trying to develop </v>

3
00:00:07.931 --> 00:00:12.430
<v Speaker 1>and become a socially acceptable </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality that happens in a different </v>

4
00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:19.541
<v Speaker 1>way as far as he's concerned for each of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the genders and so one of the prices </v>

5
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.360
<v Speaker 1>young would say that we pay and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a very modern idea in some ways </v>

6
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.040
<v Speaker 1>for growing up as a distinctly gendered </v>
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>

7
00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:36.041
<v Speaker 1>is that it's very easy for men to </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppress and fail to develop,</v>

8
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.530
<v Speaker 1>to develop those elements of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>character that might be considered </v>

9
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.191
<v Speaker 1>classically feminine and it's difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>for women to develop and express those </v>

10
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.190
<v Speaker 1>aspects of their personality that might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be classically considered masculine and </v>

11
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.180
<v Speaker 1>but so young believer that nested inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shadow in some sense where the </v>

12
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Contra sexual capacities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

13
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.770
<v Speaker 1>for a man given what we knew about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperamental difference between men and</v>

14
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:10.430
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may be that men could be more,</v>

15
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.120
<v Speaker 1>could develop the capacity for true </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion and care if they,</v>

16
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.910
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>

17
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>They could find that ability within what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've thrown out in the shadow.</v>

18
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>And women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

19
00:01:25.801 --> 00:01:30.801
<v Speaker 1>could find the capacity to be aggressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and assertive because that's part of </v>

20
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:36.321
<v Speaker 1>what they threw out during their stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their course of development because </v>

21
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:40.401
<v Speaker 1>of because of it's a priory </v>
<v Speaker 1>categorization as inappropriate </v>

22
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

23
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that you thought that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

24
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 1>that people should be raised without any</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender identity.</v>

25
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:52.671
<v Speaker 1>That issue never came up for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just thought that once you had </v>

26
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:56.901
<v Speaker 1>established a personality that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently developed to be acceptable </v>

27
00:01:58.601 --> 00:02:02.200
<v Speaker 1>socially and functional on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual level,</v>

28
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.570
<v Speaker 1>then you could have the opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>expand that personality and to take into</v>

29
00:02:07.571 --> 00:02:12.571
<v Speaker 1>yourself elements of of perception and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought and behavior</v>

30
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

31
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have had the sophistication</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to handle at an earlier stage</v>

32
00:02:22.331 --> 00:02:27.331
<v Speaker 1>of development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So young would say perhaps that if </v>

33
00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:33.301
<v Speaker 1>you're a male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to become masculine before you </v>

34
00:02:33.301 --> 00:02:33.550
<v Speaker 1>could become feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you were a female,</v>

35
00:02:33.551 --> 00:02:38.551
<v Speaker 1>the reverse is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that if your development only star </v>

36
00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:42.430
<v Speaker 1>stops with a narrow and categorical </v>
<v Speaker 1>gender identity,</v>

37
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>then there are elements that of of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being that you could draw on that </v>

38
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:51.880
<v Speaker 1>aren't at your disposal and that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>make you weak.</v>

39
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.350
<v Speaker 1>So the shadow breaks up into the anima </v>
<v Speaker 1>anonymous and the atom is female inside </v>

40
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 1>the mail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

41
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:07.021
<v Speaker 1>in the animist is the male inside the </v>
<v Speaker 1>female and young believe that he could </v>

42
00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:11.461
<v Speaker 1>see those partial spirits manifesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves in people's behavior.</v>

43
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:17.491
<v Speaker 1>And so he talked about a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical behaviors that he thought were </v>

44
00:03:17.491 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 1>associated either with Anima possession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that would be in the case of a man or</v>

45
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>animas possession in the case of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

46
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>And so he would regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ever talk to someone who's female</v>

47
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.480
<v Speaker 1>who seems to respond to all of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>propositions with nothing but </v>

48
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 1>argumentation for the sake of </v>
<v Speaker 1>argumentation.</v>

49
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Human would regard that as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestation of possession by the </v>

50
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.541
<v Speaker 1>animus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you ever talked to a man who is a</v>

51
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>irrationally possessed by</v>

52
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:57.710
<v Speaker 1>second rate and few tile emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he would regard that as possession </v>

53
00:03:57.991 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 1>by the anima.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

54
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.280
<v Speaker 1>and you can see that if you watch for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

55
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.430
<v Speaker 1>And if you believe in such things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best thing to do when confronted </v>

56
00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:13.320
<v Speaker 1>with someone who's Animus possessed is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just shut up because you're not going to</v>

57
00:04:13.321 --> 00:04:18.321
<v Speaker 1>make any headway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the point of the argument of an </v>

58
00:04:18.321 --> 00:04:21.360
<v Speaker 1>animist inspired argument is to get you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to argue not to win.</v>

59
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Because by getting you to argue the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animus wins.</v>
