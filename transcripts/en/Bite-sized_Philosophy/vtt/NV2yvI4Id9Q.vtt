1
00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.270
<v Speaker 1>There are women are very good in high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

2
00:00:03.271 --> 00:00:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Then they go to college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very good.</v>

3
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:06.570
<v Speaker 1>In College,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had nailed her damn grades.</v>

4
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:11.571
<v Speaker 1>They do their studying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get their a's and they end the ace </v>

5
00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Al Sat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're smart too.</v>

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Then they go off to do their articling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're really,</v>

7
00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:19.581
<v Speaker 1>really good at it and then they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>offered an associate position and </v>

8
00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:22.881
<v Speaker 1>they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good at it and then by the time </v>

9
00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:24.681
<v Speaker 1>they're 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make partner and let's say they're </v>

10
00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:24.681
<v Speaker 1>in high pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high paying jobs,</v>

11
00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>$250,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

12
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 1>$300,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

13
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>$500 an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

14
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>What's your life like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You work all the time,</v>

15
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy hours a week,</v>

16
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>75 hours a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flat out,</v>

17
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 1>and you don't get to make any mistakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if your client calls you at three in</v>

18
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 1>the morning on Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on Sunday you say,</v>

19
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm really glad to hear you hear from </v>
<v Speaker 1>you because if you don't,</v>

20
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:53.751
<v Speaker 1>there's some hot law firm in New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll take your client from you at a </v>

21
00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:56.250
<v Speaker 1>moment's notice and the client is paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>you whatever the firm,</v>

22
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.400
<v Speaker 1>$750 an hour of which maybe you get 3:50</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they want is an answer about </v>

23
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>something really complicated right?</v>

24
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Bloody now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can say all you want about the </v>

25
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.121
<v Speaker 1>fact that women have a difficult time </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that because it's a male dominant </v>

26
00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:14.841
<v Speaker 1>patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any any female lawyer who's hit 30 and </v>

27
00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>his partner that has any sense at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows that complete bloody rubbish.</v>

28
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 1>It's market determined right to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>core.</v>

29
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.480
<v Speaker 1>What happens to the women when they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their thirties?</v>

30
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 1>They all leave the high end law firms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

31
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Because who in their right mind would </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to live like that?</v>

32
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.230
<v Speaker 1>That's the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

33
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Once you make about $60,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year for your family,</v>

34
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:39.921
<v Speaker 1>but let's say for you personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>additional income makes zero has zero </v>

35
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:42.360
<v Speaker 1>impact on your quality of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

36
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.870
<v Speaker 1>so why work 80 hours a week while men </v>
<v Speaker 1>will do it?</v>

37
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Some men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few,</v>

38
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.060
<v Speaker 1>a handful of hyper competitive men who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are obsessed with hitting the pinnacle </v>

39
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>of the given dominance hierarchy there </v>
<v Speaker 1>in will happily work 80 hours a week and</v>

40
00:01:56.701 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>they'll forgo everything else.</v>

41
00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

42
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
<v Speaker 1>children way in the second category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so those men are often very </v>

43
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.650
<v Speaker 1>difficult to live with too because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so obsessed with their career.</v>

44
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.650
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to have a relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and maybe they don't have much of a</v>

45
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:15.651
<v Speaker 1>relationship with their kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're damn good at what they do </v>

46
00:02:15.651 --> 00:02:18.651
<v Speaker 1>and part of that is they're smart and </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplined and they'll work nonstop all</v>

47
00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:23.931
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an obsession and that's the </v>

48
00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:26.601
<v Speaker 1>sort of people who run things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the people who run things </v>

49
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:30.590
<v Speaker 1>while they're often also disagreeable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you want to wrote a manage </v>

50
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.590
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

51
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.090
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when it's not an easy thing to </v>

52
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.211
<v Speaker 1>not be liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually if you're an agreeable </v>

53
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:38.211
<v Speaker 1>person and women are more agreeable than</v>
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

54
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:42.500
<v Speaker 1>it's quite painful to be disliked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're in a managerial and </v>

55
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 1>executive position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probability that people are going to</v>

56
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:45.180
<v Speaker 1>like you is quite low.</v>

57
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a real son of a bitch,</v>

58
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:48.970
<v Speaker 1>then they're going to dislike you more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

59
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:51.750
<v Speaker 1>It's those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those positions are very stressful,</v>

60
00:02:51.751 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 1>partly because of the interpersonal </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamics and they're also incredibly,</v>

61
00:02:55.561 --> 00:03:00.561
<v Speaker 1>incredibly competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the women hit that at and they're </v>

62
00:03:00.561 --> 00:03:04.651
<v Speaker 1>completely qualified in the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Firms are bloody desperate to keep them </v>

63
00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>because it's really hard to find highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>qualified people,</v>

64
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>especially once you've put all that time</v>
<v Speaker 1>into training them,</v>

65
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're also good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing in business.</v>

66
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>The law firms trip over themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 1>try to keep them.</v>

67
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 1>They can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The women think,</v>

68
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>why in the world am I doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

69
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.530
<v Speaker 1>When the world would anyone in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>right mind do this?</v>

70
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 1>Especially because they're often married</v>
<v Speaker 1>by that point too,</v>

71
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.620
<v Speaker 1>and generally they've married a husband </v>
<v Speaker 1>who makes as much money or more than </v>

72
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 1>them so they don't need the damn money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they think,</v>

73
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more to life than this,</v>

74
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the right thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

75
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.270
<v Speaker 1>and so they go and find a job that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine to five and controllable so that </v>

76
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>they can hire a nanny and have some kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have a life,</v>

77
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

78
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 1>that's the intelligent thing to do.</v>

79
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>So we've got things backwards in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

80
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>We're thinking at least in part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't there more women in positions</v>

81
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 1>of power?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrong question.</v>

82
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.860
<v Speaker 1>The right question is why are there any </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute all who want those positions of </v>

83
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.721
<v Speaker 1>power?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's not just positions of </v>

84
00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:05.521
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be such a knothead to think </v>

85
00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:05.521
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

86
00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:05.521
<v Speaker 1>it's a position of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

87
00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:10.410
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a position of overwhelming </v>

88
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and if you make mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

89
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you occupy that position </v>

90
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 1>of power and everyone does what they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>told all the time in your life is easy.</v>

91
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget about that.</v>

92
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 1>People are on your case to do exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right thing all the time,</v>

93
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>100 percent of the time and maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want that.</v>

94
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:30.781
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the what I don't know what people </v>

95
00:04:30.781 --> 00:04:33.421
<v Speaker 1>think is these people are all sitting in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their offices with their feet up on the </v>

96
00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 1>desk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking cigars and pressing the world.</v>

97
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like that isn't how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people,</v>

98
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:41.581
<v Speaker 1>they work flat out all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so and it's fine if that's what you want</v>

99
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 1>and some people are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're hyper industrious people,</v>

100
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>From a trade perspective,</v>

101
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 1>no matter where you put them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put them in a forest with an axe,</v>

102
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:52.630
<v Speaker 1>they just wander around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chopping down trees nonstop,</v>

103
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there it's built into them.</v>

104
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to have a balanced life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you should want that,</v>

105
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:00.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the other thing you'll find,</v>

106
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>this is God's Gospel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Truth is that the older you get,</v>

107
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:07.870
<v Speaker 1>if you have any sense at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more important your family is to you</v>

108
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

109
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.920
<v Speaker 1>the utility of your career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that peaks around 35 or 40 and it </v>

110
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.330
<v Speaker 1>starts to decline pretty rapidly after </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

111
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:21.331
<v Speaker 1>and what happens if you're fortunate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have someone in your life that you </v>

112
00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:22.270
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you've woven yourself together with</v>

113
00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:27.271
<v Speaker 1>and you have some kids so that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to do from the time you're 50 </v>

114
00:05:27.271 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 1>till the time you're 80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's a real mistake.</v>

115
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a barren future without children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

116
00:05:31.511 --> 00:05:36.340
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that it's a real mistake </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we do a terrible job of say,</v>

117
00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:38.260
<v Speaker 1>putting that image forward and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

118
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:39.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you know,</v>

119
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
<v Speaker 1>because women have access to the birth </v>
<v Speaker 1>control pill now and can compete in the </v>

120
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.330
<v Speaker 1>same domains as men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking,</v>

121
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.480
<v Speaker 1>there is a real practical problem here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's partly an economic problem now </v>

122
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.741
<v Speaker 1>because when I was roughly your age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was still possible for a one income </v>

123
00:05:55.741 --> 00:06:00.031
<v Speaker 1>family do exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While you know that wages have been flat</v>

124
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 1>except in the upper one percent since </v>
<v Speaker 1>1973.</v>

125
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

126
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:11.501
<v Speaker 1>it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens when you double the labor </v>

127
00:06:11.501 --> 00:06:11.501
<v Speaker 1>force?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>

128
00:06:11.501 --> 00:06:16.210
<v Speaker 1>You have the value of labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now we're in a situation where it </v>

129
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.030
<v Speaker 1>takes two people to make as much as one </v>
<v Speaker 1>did before.</v>

130
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:22.240
<v Speaker 1>So we went from a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 1>women's career opportunities were </v>

131
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.991
<v Speaker 1>relatively limited to where they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively unlimited and there were two </v>

132
00:06:25.991 --> 00:06:30.251
<v Speaker 1>incomes to wear and so women could work </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a situation where women have to work </v>

133
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.510
<v Speaker 1>and they only make half as much as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have otherwise and now we're going</v>

134
00:06:34.511 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 1>to go into a situation.</v>

135
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.810
<v Speaker 1>This is the next step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas women will work because men </v>

136
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's coming now.</v>

137
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.200
<v Speaker 1>So we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an economics economist </v>

138
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.451
<v Speaker 1>articles showing that 50 percent now of </v>
<v Speaker 1>of boys in school or having trouble with</v>

139
00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:52.730
<v Speaker 1>their basic subjects and you look around</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and universities,</v>

140
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 1>you can see this happening and I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched it over decades.</v>

141
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.210
<v Speaker 1>I would say 90 percent of the people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my personality class are now women.</v>

142
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.540
<v Speaker 1>There won't be a damn man left and </v>
<v Speaker 1>university in 10 years except in the </v>

143
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.141
<v Speaker 1>stem fields and it's a complete bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe and it's a catastrophe for </v>

144
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:10.760
<v Speaker 1>women because I don't know where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell you're going to find someone to,</v>

145
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.730
<v Speaker 1>to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

146
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to marry and have a family with.</v>

147
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 1>If this keeps happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

148
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.010
<v Speaker 1>And you think when you're 19 because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're so clueless when you're 19,</v>

149
00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:20.150
<v Speaker 1>you don't know a bloody thing.</v>

150
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.840
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

151
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:22.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really sure I want children </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

152
00:07:22.471 --> 00:07:23.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

153
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:25.130
<v Speaker 1>you can tell how well you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>educated.</v>

154
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dismal,</v>

155
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.520
<v Speaker 1>dismal without fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you,</v>

156
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:36.521
<v Speaker 1>without fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched women go through their </v>

157
00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:36.521
<v Speaker 1>professional careers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many,</v>

158
00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:38.570
<v Speaker 1>many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very rare woman who at the age of</v>

159
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:40.550
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't consider having a child.</v>

160
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Her primary desire and the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't consider that.</v>

161
00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Generally in my observation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something that isn't quite right</v>

162
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 1>in the way that they're constituted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are looking at the world.</v>

163
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.150
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you get women who are truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>non maternal.</v>

164
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by temperament there.</v>

165
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.660
<v Speaker 1>They have a masculine tempera </v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable.</v>

166
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.730
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not particularly compassionate,</v>

167
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.620
<v Speaker 1>they're not maternal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't really.</v>

168
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:02.510
<v Speaker 1>They're not that interested in kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough,</v>

169
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:07.511
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there aren't that many of them and </v>

170
00:08:07.511 --> 00:08:09.221
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty who will not admit to </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves that that's what they most </v>

171
00:08:09.261 --> 00:08:10.100
<v Speaker 1>desperately want.</v>

172
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Do you think women would be better off </v>
<v Speaker 2>or their favorite?</v>

173
00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:15.670
<v Speaker 2>Thirty.</v>

174
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:22.470
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like it really is a problem </v>

175
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:23.950
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really tough one.</v>

176
00:08:23.951 --> 00:08:26.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody knows the answer </v>
<v Speaker 3>to that because</v>

177
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:31.150
<v Speaker 2>35 new kids are saying 10:11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you can go and get a bachelor's and</v>

178
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:36.650
<v Speaker 2>masters easy that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having the career first and then trying </v>

179
00:08:38.301 --> 00:08:39.620
<v Speaker 2>to raise young kids.</v>

180
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:41.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

181
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.020
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't answer that because I've seen </v>

182
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.830
<v Speaker 3>women do a good job of it both both ways</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you do get the odd woman who manages</v>

183
00:08:47.831 --> 00:08:49.820
<v Speaker 3>a high powered career and kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Jesus,</v>

184
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.800
<v Speaker 3>those women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

185
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.660
<v Speaker 3>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

186
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.240
<v Speaker 3>they buy more powerful microwaves </v>
<v Speaker 3>because take 45 seconds to cook the food</v>

187
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:59.850
<v Speaker 3>instead of a minute and I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're,</v>

188
00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:02.280
<v Speaker 3>they're up at five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They exercise for half an hour.</v>

189
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:04.620
<v Speaker 3>They make breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get their kids ready to work,</v>

190
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:07.920
<v Speaker 3>they go to work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they worked 14 hours a 14 hour days flat</v>

191
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:12.921
<v Speaker 3>bloody out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They come home and work for another two </v>

192
00:09:12.921 --> 00:09:14.931
<v Speaker 3>hours to get their kids organized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a nanny to help them out and </v>

193
00:09:14.931 --> 00:09:18.850
<v Speaker 3>then they work for two more hours before</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go to bed at like one and then </v>

194
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:19.170
<v Speaker 3>they're up at five and they do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>again and I'll tell you,</v>

195
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:24.171
<v Speaker 3>you better be tough if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that physically too because you'll </v>

196
00:09:24.171 --> 00:09:24.270
<v Speaker 3>just burn yourself to a crisp.</v>

197
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.190
<v Speaker 3>I've seen some women manage it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

198
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:31.370
<v Speaker 3>but they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're tough and they're rare because </v>

199
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.260
<v Speaker 3>that's a hell of a hell of a regimen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then if anything goes wrong,</v>

200
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:39.261
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a sick kid or something like </v>

201
00:09:39.261 --> 00:09:40.821
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or there's any sort of crisis in your </v>

202
00:09:40.821 --> 00:09:40.821
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

203
00:09:40.821 --> 00:09:40.821
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

204
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.520
<v Speaker 3>then it becomes too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know the answer to that,</v>

205
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:45.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

206
00:09:45.091 --> 00:09:50.091
<v Speaker 3>the advantage women have is they live </v>
<v Speaker 3>about eight years longer than men </v>

207
00:09:50.091 --> 00:09:52.460
<v Speaker 3>because testosterone kills men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Limited.</v>

208
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.210
<v Speaker 3>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

209
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.150
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pay up front and gain on the,</v>

210
00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:58.140
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

211
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.200
<v Speaker 3>in the long run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how it isn't clear how our society </v>

212
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:03.690
<v Speaker 3>should sort this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

213
00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:08.691
<v Speaker 3>And it's partly we don't know what to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>now that women have control over their </v>

214
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:08.880
<v Speaker 3>reproductive function.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a big mystery.</v>

215
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:09.270
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

216
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.840
<v Speaker 2>But I think later on competition and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's always a conference.</v>

217
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:28.630
<v Speaker 2>People are always hiring talent because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>

218
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:31.920
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

219
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:33.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the thing is young,</v>

220
00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:35.880
<v Speaker 3>stupid people have the advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 3>being young,</v>

221
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:41.810
<v Speaker 3>middle aged,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid people have the disadvantage of </v>

222
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.151
<v Speaker 3>being middle aged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you're going to hire a young </v>

223
00:10:44.151 --> 00:10:44.151
<v Speaker 3>stupid person or a middle aged stupid </v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

224
00:10:44.151 --> 00:10:45.480
<v Speaker 3>you'll go for the young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid person.</v>

225
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:46.890
<v Speaker 3>And I'm stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

226
00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:47.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

227
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:51.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm being sarcastic obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean without,</v>

228
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.670
<v Speaker 3>without experience and just getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>started in the world,</v>

229
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:58.700
<v Speaker 3>you're much more likely to favor someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>young because there's an instant </v>

230
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.170
<v Speaker 3>explanation for their relative </v>
<v Speaker 3>cluelessness and it's a problem,</v>

231
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

232
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.760
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know what the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one,</v>

233
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.340
<v Speaker 3>one answer certainly is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in part,</v>

234
00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:13.341
<v Speaker 3>is to start letting young women know </v>
<v Speaker 3>what being 30 and being female is like </v>

235
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:18.740
<v Speaker 3>because and also to disabuse them of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>notion that there's something magical </v>

236
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:18.780
<v Speaker 3>about a career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

237
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:20.350
<v Speaker 3>most people don't have careers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

238
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:25.550
<v Speaker 3>they have jobs and the reason you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>paid for a job is because you're being </v>

239
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.120
<v Speaker 3>asked to do things you wouldn't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>unless you were being paid.</v>

240
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.480
<v Speaker 3>And so it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not some not some utopia of cigar </v>

241
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.170
<v Speaker 3>smoking with your boots up on your desk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

242
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:39.190
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that that would be such a utopia to </v>

243
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.190
<v Speaker 3>begin with.</v>
