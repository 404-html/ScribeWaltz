1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the question is can that sense of </v>

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>meaning behind jacked and the answer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is absolutely,</v>

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.370
<v Speaker 1>absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you could say that the ultimate </v>

4
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.140
<v Speaker 1>sense of meaning is composed of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union of fragmentary senses,</v>

5
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>of meaning and the fragmentary sensitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning can be overwhelmingly powerful,</v>

6
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.400
<v Speaker 1>anger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual lust and and,</v>

7
00:00:19.401 --> 00:00:24.401
<v Speaker 1>and the sorts of things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced wouldn't say when you're </v>

8
00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 1>playing a video game which are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully calibrated to keep you on the,</v>

9
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:30.711
<v Speaker 1>on the edge of exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say now I'm not a full of video </v>

10
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:35.421
<v Speaker 1>games because games are complicated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't clear what people are doing </v>

11
00:00:35.421 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>when they're playing them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>they may be expanding their cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills,</v>

13
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.310
<v Speaker 1>they may be learning to cooperate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may be learning to engage in </v>

14
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.101
<v Speaker 1>complex problem solving and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of it's also a matter of </v>

15
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>50 hours a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not,</v>

17
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.160
<v Speaker 1>unless you're going to go pro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

18
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Because there's other things you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be attending to.</v>

19
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:59.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not a stable solution for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>

20
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 1>your society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too one sided.</v>

21
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can get pulled down rabbit holes</v>

22
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>of all sorts that are one sided pursuits</v>
<v Speaker 1>of meaning,</v>

23
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.510
<v Speaker 1>so it's something we're actually going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk about as the later classes </v>

24
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 1>unfold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is how do you stop yourself</v>

25
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:21.471
<v Speaker 1>from falling prey to a pathologist sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of meaning and I think one of the </v>

26
00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:25.641
<v Speaker 1>answers to that is don't lie because </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're hoping is that your nervous </v>

27
00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:30.831
<v Speaker 1>system is sufficiently healthy and well </v>
<v Speaker 1>program so that what it reads out to you</v>

28
00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:36.321
<v Speaker 1>is reliable and if you pathologize your </v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche by either through sins of </v>

29
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>omission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say or or outright deception,</v>

30
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>you're going warp that internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and it's not going to read out</v>

31
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>properly to you and then your sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning will lead you astray.</v>

32
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>So like one of the reasons for speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth,</v>

33
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.810
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say that because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to speak the truth,</v>

34
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>but you do know how not to lie and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a game.</v>

35
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>You're playing with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can define the damn lies.</v>

36
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:03.160
<v Speaker 1>No one else has to do that for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

37
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.210
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try not to utter falsehoods because </v>

38
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>you wore your neurological structure by </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing so,</v>

39
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 1>and then it will read out pathologically</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then if you rely on it to guide you,</v>

40
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:18.531
<v Speaker 1>it will run you right off a cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's where there's a moral element </v>

41
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>to this is if you're going to rely on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your sense of meaning,</v>

42
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.120
<v Speaker 1>make sure that you don't pollute the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism.</v>

43
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

44
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>This is partly why people go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>confession,</v>

45
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is,</v>

46
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.120
<v Speaker 1>which is a psychotherapeutic technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

47
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.270
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what stupid miserable wretched things </v>

48
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.270
<v Speaker 1>did I do this week?</v>

49
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good thing to,</v>

50
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>to make conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

51
00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Because maybe you cannot do them the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next week and you think,</v>

52
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you bother?</v>

53
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:45.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

54
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>you're in a ship sailing across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stormy seas.</v>

55
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:51.750
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

56
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>if you're hacking holes in it with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pickaxe,</v>

57
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.090
<v Speaker 1>you should probably pay attention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that before you sink,</v>

58
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>so it's a good idea to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep what you're doing.</v>

59
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>That's stupid in mind so that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop doing it,</v>

60
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>and so then you can more and more rely </v>
<v Speaker 1>on yourself and your and your own.</v>

61
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Your own conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

62
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:16.351
<v Speaker 1>as a guide to proper action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know in the Pinocchio story is that </v>

63
00:03:16.351 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 1>the conscience was not an unerring guide</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Pinocchio.</v>

64
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.310
<v Speaker 1>It had to learn and so and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also partly pushing yourself into </v>

65
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:29.251
<v Speaker 1>new situations and differentiating </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself so that you get wiser and so </v>

66
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:32.280
<v Speaker 1>it's courage as well as truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

67
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 1>those might be the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more beauty,</v>

68
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>courage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

69
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental virtues.</v>

70
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Why be virtuous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the question,</v>

71
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 1>and so that you can bear the suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life without becoming corrupt,</v>

72
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's practical.</v>

73
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.700
<v Speaker 1>It's practical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's nothing more practical than </v>

74
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so unless you want misery and people do,</v>

75
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>you know it's exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Misery.</v>

76
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>So other questions?</v>

77
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

78
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.610
<v Speaker 1>See you next Wednesday.</v>
