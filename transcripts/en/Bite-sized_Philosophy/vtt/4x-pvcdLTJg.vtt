1
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.380
<v Speaker 1>I think that fundamentalists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheistic scientists have the same </v>

2
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamentalists,</v>

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.700
<v Speaker 1>so we could say the Christian </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalists in the US make the </v>

4
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.510
<v Speaker 1>proposition that biblical stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll call them mythological stories,</v>

5
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>are literal representations of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

6
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that might be true depending on what</v>

7
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:33.051
<v Speaker 1>you mean by literal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they mean by literal over what </v>

8
00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:36.471
<v Speaker 1>they attempt to make literal mean is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're in the same category of </v>

9
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:39.481
<v Speaker 1>scientific facts because they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that there are different ways </v>

10
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>of approaching truth and the truth can </v>
<v Speaker 1>serve different purposes.</v>

11
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:50.001
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a sense that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition of truth is actually </v>

12
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:53.541
<v Speaker 1>something like a tool rather than an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ontological statement about the reality </v>

13
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the.</v>

14
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.960
<v Speaker 1>The fundamentalists basically make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition that the idea that God </v>

15
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 1>created the world in six days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5,000</v>

16
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>years ago is literally true and they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 5,000</v>

17
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>year estimate.</v>

18
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.540
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by going through the genealogies in the </v>

19
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Old Testament and adding up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical ages and figuring out.</v>

20
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.410
<v Speaker 1>You know how long before Moses Adam </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived and some bishop did that back in </v>

21
00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:20.070
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in the mid 18 hundreds,</v>

22
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.220
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was somewhere back about that </v>

23
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.510
<v Speaker 1>time and more or less that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted as canonical fact ever since,</v>

24
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.610
<v Speaker 1>and then the scientists say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

25
00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are empirical truth.</v>

26
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 1>They're just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

27
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.540
<v Speaker 1>and that's the only difference there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the fundamentalists and the </v>

28
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.161
<v Speaker 1>atheist scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental say those are </v>

29
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>fundamental scientific truths and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're right and the scientists say,</v>

30
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their scientific truths,</v>

31
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>they just happened to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

32
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a stupid argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>personally.</v>

33
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean for a bunch of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that the people who wrote the,</v>

34
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.320
<v Speaker 1>the ancient stories that we have access </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

35
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.280
<v Speaker 1>we're in no way shape or form </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>

36
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern people tend to think that you </v>

37
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.000
<v Speaker 1>think like a scientist and people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>always thought that way.</v>

38
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.080
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do not think like a scientist.</v>

39
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Even scientists hardly even think like </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>

40
00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>but if you're not scientifically </v>
<v Speaker 1>trained,</v>

41
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>you don't think like a scientist at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things,</v>

42
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:20.061
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that characterizes your thinking is </v>

43
00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:20.061
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you have a theory,</v>

44
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>what you do is wander around in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world looking for reasons why it's true,</v>

45
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.110
<v Speaker 1>and the scientists does exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite of that in the little tiny,</v>

46
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:33.111
<v Speaker 1>narrow domain where he or she is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually capable of being a scientist </v>

47
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:35.190
<v Speaker 1>and what they have is a theory and </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked for a way to prove it wrong.</v>

48
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>But believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't run around doing that.</v>

49
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can train yourself so now and then </v>

50
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.860
<v Speaker 1>you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>we can learn to listen to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

52
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>on the off chance that you might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

53
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>but that is by no means a natural way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

54
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.790
<v Speaker 1>And of course the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

55
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.220
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental philosophical axioms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientific method weren't developed </v>

56
00:02:57.601 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>until descartes and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who else?</v>

57
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Descartes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bacon is one more.</v>

58
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name escapes me at the moment,</v>

59
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>but you can argue about when science </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerged,</v>

60
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:09.830
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

61
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>it certainly emerged in it's articulated</v>
<v Speaker 1>form within the last thousand years.</v>

62
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.730
<v Speaker 1>I think you could say even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically that had emerged in the </v>

63
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>last 500 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might argue with that and say,</v>

64
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:26.791
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about the Greeks and other people </v>

65
00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:28.381
<v Speaker 1>who were fairly technologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated or who invented geometry </v>

66
00:03:28.381 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>or that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

67
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear precursors to the idea of empirical</v>

68
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle,</v>

69
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:39.811
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was writing down his knowledge </v>

70
00:03:39.811 --> 00:03:42.541
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it never occurred to him to actually go </v>

71
00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>out in the world and look at it to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>if what he assumed about it was true and</v>

72
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:48.361
<v Speaker 1>it certainly never occurred to Aristotle</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get 20 people to go look at the same </v>

73
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>thing independently.</v>

74
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 1>Write down exactly how they went about </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it,</v>

75
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.770
<v Speaker 1>compare the records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then extract out what was common and</v>

76
00:03:56.771 --> 00:04:01.771
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems self evident to us to some </v>

77
00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:02.180
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

78
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.770
<v Speaker 1>it was by no means self evident to </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone 500 years ago and people still </v>

79
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not even.</v>

80
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not plausible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you know anything about the history </v>

81
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 1>of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not plausible to pause it.</v>

82
00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:21.181
<v Speaker 1>That stories about the nature of reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>that existed before 500 years ago were </v>

83
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 1>scientific at any but the most cursory </v>
<v Speaker 1>of ways.</v>

84
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.650
<v Speaker 1>So why we have that argument continually</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat beyond me.</v>

85
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.520
<v Speaker 1>Part of the reason is though that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone fundamentalists included really</v>

86
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>believe in scientific facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though they hate it,</v>

87
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.050
<v Speaker 1>they'll use computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll fly,</v>

88
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.290
<v Speaker 1>computers won't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't work unless quantum mechanics </v>

89
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.141
<v Speaker 1>were correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the fact that you use a high tech </v>

90
00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:53.551
<v Speaker 1>device indicates through your action </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you actually accept the theories </v>

91
00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 1>upon which is predicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

92
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Same as flying the same as anything you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do in it too.</v>

93
00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Complex Technological Society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're stuck with it.</v>

94
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 1>You're reading by the lights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they work?</v>

95
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they work well,</v>

96
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.060
<v Speaker 1>so it's really hard for people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to hold onto a way of looking at </v>

97
00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:14.341
<v Speaker 1>the world that appears to contradict the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific claims when everything they </v>

98
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:18.670
<v Speaker 1>do is predicated on their acceptance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the validity of the scientific claims.</v>

99
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 1>It's really problematic for people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's problematic in a real way,</v>

100
00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:27.841
<v Speaker 1>I think because one of the problems with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientific viewpoint is it doesn't </v>

101
00:05:27.841 --> 00:05:29.230
<v Speaker 1>tell you anything about what you should </v>
<v Speaker 1>do with your life.</v>

102
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.890
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't solve the problem of value at</v>

103
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:34.330
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

104
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:39.331
<v Speaker 1>it might make it more difficult because </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the fundamental scientific </v>

105
00:05:39.331 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 1>claims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

106
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:42.250
<v Speaker 1>is that every fact is of an equal </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility,</v>

107
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.380
<v Speaker 1>at least from a scientific perspective.</v>

108
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no hierarchy facts.</v>

109
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not exactly true because you can </v>

110
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>think of one theory is more true than </v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

111
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.980
<v Speaker 1>but that boils down to saying that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more useful than.</v>

112
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that that's a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good exception.</v>

113
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fine.</v>

114
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 1>You got the scientific atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on one end,</v>

115
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:09.881
<v Speaker 1>and you got the religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalists on the other and what </v>

116
00:06:09.881 --> 00:06:09.881
<v Speaker 1>they both agree on whether they like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not,</v>

117
00:06:09.881 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 1>is that there's so much power in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific method that it's difficult to</v>

118
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:18.941
<v Speaker 1>dispute the validity of scientific facts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they seem to exist in contradiction </v>

119
00:06:18.941 --> 00:06:23.740
<v Speaker 1>to the older archaic stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you also accept them as fast fact </v>

120
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 1>based account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do we do about that?</v>

121
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're on a scientific atheist end of</v>

122
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

123
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:35.951
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those old stories or just superstitious </v>

124
00:06:35.951 --> 00:06:35.951
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second rate,</v>

125
00:06:35.951 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 1>barbaric archaic forms of science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just dispense with them.</v>

126
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 1>They're nothing but trouble and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're on their fundamentalist side you</v>

127
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

128
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:45.260
<v Speaker 1>we'll try to shoe horn science into this</v>
<v Speaker 1>framework.</v>

129
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:50.261
<v Speaker 1>And really that doesn't work very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work very well with the </v>

130
00:06:50.261 --> 00:06:50.261
<v Speaker 1>claims of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

131
00:06:50.261 --> 00:06:54.870
<v Speaker 1>fact it works very badly and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem because evolutionary theory is </v>

132
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.660
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a killer theory and it's re,</v>

133
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.240
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

134
00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:04.241
<v Speaker 1>really hard and like it's not a complete</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory and there's lots of things we </v>

135
00:07:04.241 --> 00:07:04.241
<v Speaker 1>don't know about evolution,</v>

136
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:05.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

137
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.560
<v Speaker 1>trying to wear hand wave that away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

138
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.950
<v Speaker 1>that's not gonna work without dispensing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with most of biology.</v>

139
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.740
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a big problem.</v>

140
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.770
<v Speaker 1>So here's another way of thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

141
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.880
<v Speaker 1>You don't just need one way of looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the world.</v>

142
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you need two ways of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and I'm not exactly sure how </v>

143
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.171
<v Speaker 1>they should be related to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like which should take precedence under </v>

144
00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:37.350
<v Speaker 1>which circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one problem is what's the world made</v>

145
00:07:37.351 --> 00:07:39.030
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.690
<v Speaker 1>what's the world conceptualized as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective place made of.</v>

147
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.830
<v Speaker 1>And the other is how should you conduct </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself while you're alive?</v>

148
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.820
<v Speaker 1>And there's no reason to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 1>those questions can be answered using </v>

149
00:07:53.311 --> 00:07:54.330
<v Speaker 1>the same approach.</v>

150
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

151
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:03.040
<v Speaker 1>physics has its methods and chemistry </v>
<v Speaker 1>has its methods and biology has its </v>

152
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.401
<v Speaker 1>methods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a method for obtaining the truth can </v>

153
00:08:06.401 --> 00:08:11.231
<v Speaker 1>be bound to a domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why would we necessarily assume that </v>

154
00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:15.281
<v Speaker 1>you could use the same set of tools to </v>
<v Speaker 1>represent the world as a place of </v>

155
00:08:15.281 --> 00:08:18.860
<v Speaker 1>objects and to represent it as a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>in which a biological creature would act</v>

156
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.570
<v Speaker 1>in anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm suggesting that we,</v>

157
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.280
<v Speaker 1>that we don't view it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have two different viewpoints.</v>

158
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they can be brought together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it's not obvious how,</v>

159
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.690
<v Speaker 1>but that it's not a tenable solution to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get rid of one in favor of the other.</v>

160
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.130
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason for that is</v>

161
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:45.650
<v Speaker 1>you need to know how to conduct yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

162
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:50.860
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a value system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even look at the damn world </v>

163
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.250
<v Speaker 1>without a value system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not possible.</v>

164
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Your emotional health is dependent on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>value system.</v>

165
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 1>The way you interact with other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>is dependent on a value system.</v>

166
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 1>There's no getting away from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>

167
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:06.501
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no justification for any value </v>

168
00:09:06.501 --> 00:09:08.931
<v Speaker 1>system from a scientific perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to draw that conclusion </v>

169
00:09:08.931 --> 00:09:10.500
<v Speaker 1>that no value system is valid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where the hell does that leave you?</v>

170
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.020
<v Speaker 1>There is no down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no APP,</v>

171
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 1>there's no rationale for moving in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

172
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.210
<v Speaker 1>There's not even really any rationale </v>
<v Speaker 1>for living.</v>

173
00:09:18.211 --> 00:09:20.270
<v Speaker 1>And so people say things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why?</v>

174
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Why the hell should I care what happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a million years?</v>

175
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to know the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

176
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:24.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

177
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid but true.</v>

178
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.560
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I think it's stupid is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's just a game,</v>

179
00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:33.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can take anything of any sort,</v>

180
00:09:33.831 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 1>can find a context in which it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant.</v>

181
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:41.750
<v Speaker 1>It's just a rational games like who </v>
<v Speaker 1>cares if a hundred children freeze to </v>

182
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.750
<v Speaker 1>death in a blizzard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

183
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.730
<v Speaker 1>what difference is going to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion years?</v>

184
00:09:44.731 --> 00:09:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you say to someone who says that</v>

185
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.310
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

186
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.430
<v Speaker 1>seems like the wrong frame of Reference </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bucko.</v>

187
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.040
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looks like to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

188
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.040
<v Speaker 1>because at some point you question the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dam frame of reference,</v>

189
00:09:56.041 --> 00:10:01.041
<v Speaker 1>not what you derive from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it certainly seems to me that </v>

190
00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:04.950
<v Speaker 1>situations like that don't allow you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use that kind of frame of reference.</v>

191
00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:09.000
<v Speaker 1>There's something inhumane about it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that trumps the logic,</v>

192
00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:11.280
<v Speaker 1>or at least it should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it doesn't,</v>

193
00:10:11.281 --> 00:10:16.281
<v Speaker 1>then all hell breaks loose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't seem to be a good </v>

194
00:10:16.281 --> 00:10:16.281
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
