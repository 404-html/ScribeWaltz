1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing one thing really stupidly that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should stop doing.</v>

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long are you going to take you to </v>

3
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.310
<v Speaker 1>figure out what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about two seconds,</v>

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've known it forever.</v>

5
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Then you could even make less demanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>there are some stupid things that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that I know are stupid and wrong </v>

7
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.430
<v Speaker 1>that I could stop doing that I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop doing,</v>

8
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.580
<v Speaker 1>and then you can just start with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can just do that and maybe it's </v>

9
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.220
<v Speaker 1>just a little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although it's not because it's.</v>

10
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a step forward on the proper </v>

11
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.370
<v Speaker 1>voyage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a small thing and you think,</v>

12
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would happen?</v>

13
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.280
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do this for a year or even a </v>

14
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.280
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just try not to do things you know,</v>

15
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.661
<v Speaker 1>to be stupid and wrong for a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means not to say things you </v>

16
00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>know to be stupid and wrong as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's the most important thing.</v>

17
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Just do it as an experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what happens,</v>

18
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:56.471
<v Speaker 1>and it's so fun because I have people </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing to me from all over the world </v>

19
00:00:56.471 --> 00:00:56.570
<v Speaker 1>who are saying they're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying,</v>

20
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:57.381 --> 00:01:02.381
<v Speaker 1>I cleaned up my room and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I stopped saying stupid things </v>

22
00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:04.310
<v Speaker 1>and my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like things are way better.</v>

23
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like who would have guessed it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

24
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.250
<v Speaker 1>And so it's low hanging fruit ban </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the other thing.</v>

25
00:01:13.311 --> 00:01:14.690
<v Speaker 1>If there's a lot of things wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

26
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>then it's really easy to start fixing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

27
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:18.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got so much.</v>

28
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.720
<v Speaker 1>There's so much territory that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabit.</v>

29
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.460
<v Speaker 1>I will make of thee a great nation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will bless thee.</v>

30
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.610
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole nation thing that's </v>

31
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.610
<v Speaker 1>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to have God on your side,</v>

32
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.640
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.730
<v Speaker 1>you might want that when things get </v>
<v Speaker 1>rough,</v>

34
00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:39.200
<v Speaker 1>that would be good and make that name </v>
<v Speaker 1>great and thou shalt be a blessing.</v>

35
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.890
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good deal.</v>

36
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Then I will bless them that bless thee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good too.</v>

37
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.110
<v Speaker 1>And curse him that curse thee and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these shall all families of the earth be</v>

38
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:56.111
<v Speaker 1>blessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that's something that </v>

39
00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:03.451
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be something if you could wake </v>
<v Speaker 1>up and your day was composed in part of </v>

40
00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:07.960
<v Speaker 1>people thanking you for all the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>things you've done in the world,</v>

41
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.490
<v Speaker 1>would that be good?</v>

42
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not impossible for that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Abraham departed.</v>

43
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the Lord had spoken unto him and lot </v>

44
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.941
<v Speaker 1>went with him and Abraham was 70 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>five years when he departed out of her </v>

45
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:28.590
<v Speaker 1>and that's old now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham lives a long time,</v>

46
00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:33.591
<v Speaker 1>but this is also part of this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he has a wife who can't have </v>

47
00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:33.591
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has nothing.</v>

48
00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been hanging around dad's shack for</v>

49
00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:38.010
<v Speaker 1>a little too long given that he's 75,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

50
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:43.011
<v Speaker 1>It's time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time to get to the fire lit </v>

51
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>underneath and the bath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these not got much going for him,</v>

52
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 1>but he still decides to move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen this too,</v>

53
00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:52.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you don't have your destiny in </v>

54
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:52.740
<v Speaker 1>hand by your time you're 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's rough.</v>

55
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.370
<v Speaker 1>You start hurting and if you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>your destiny in hand by the time you're </v>

56
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.551
<v Speaker 1>40 then you really start hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And 40 is a real fork in the road,</v>

57
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.660
<v Speaker 1>the fork in the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always where you meet the devil </v>

58
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.821
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because every time you have </v>

59
00:03:13.821 --> 00:03:14.730
<v Speaker 1>to make a decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the possibility of evil beckons.</v>

60
00:03:14.731 --> 00:03:16.620
<v Speaker 1>That's why that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend,</v>

61
00:03:16.621 --> 00:03:20.690
<v Speaker 1>I've told you a little about him and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed himself just after 40 know he had</v>

62
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.130
<v Speaker 1>had a book published hitting him with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very small press.</v>

63
00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:28.131
<v Speaker 1>He was quite a good writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he could not get himself together </v>

64
00:03:28.131 --> 00:03:30.060
<v Speaker 1>and it hit him too hard at 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying that it's hopeless at</v>

65
00:03:30.061 --> 00:03:35.061
<v Speaker 1>40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that and I'm not saying </v>

66
00:03:35.061 --> 00:03:37.731
<v Speaker 1>that partly because of these verses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also partly because of what I've </v>

67
00:03:37.731 --> 00:03:40.401
<v Speaker 1>seen in my clinical practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had people come to me who have had </v>

68
00:03:40.401 --> 00:03:41.940
<v Speaker 1>very chaotic and ill spent lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

69
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.030
<v Speaker 1>who were in that neighborhood of age </v>
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>

70
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.760
<v Speaker 1>And it's true for people who are older </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

71
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.630
<v Speaker 1>who then decided to make a real effort </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to try to make where they were </v>

72
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.090
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

73
00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:56.070
<v Speaker 1>instead of being bitter about where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't.</v>

74
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Because</v>

75
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 1>that's the bitterness that really does </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

76
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 1>when it's really not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the opposite of gratitude.</v>

77
00:04:02.621 --> 00:04:03.490
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

78
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:06.160
<v Speaker 1>it's the manifestation of resentment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you malevolent.</v>

79
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very bad to be better.</v>

80
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

81
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.960
<v Speaker 1>It's hell to be bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're 40 and you're not </v>

82
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to accept your lot and you</v>

83
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 1>have to start to improve what's right in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of you.</v>

84
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.810
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take very long.</v>

85
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 1>It's quite interesting to watch people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things can be a lot better in six months</v>

86
00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:29.290
<v Speaker 1>and they can be way better in two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a struggle,</v>

87
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Speaker 1>uphill struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's by no means impossible.</v>

88
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know again what the limit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>

89
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it depends to a degree to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree on the degree of your commitment,</v>

90
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.700
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so aber,</v>

91
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 1>it's another indication of the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>validity of this story.</v>

92
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 1>God isn't setting this up to be easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

93
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Abraham was old and he and and his and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife is old to and more than that,</v>

94
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:56.041
<v Speaker 1>she's barren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is he going to be the father of </v>

95
00:04:56.041 --> 00:04:56.041
<v Speaker 1>nations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is he going to be successful?</v>

96
00:04:56.041 --> 00:05:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the initial departure point is </v>

97
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.620
<v Speaker 1>insufficient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radically insufficient,</v>

98
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.830
<v Speaker 1>and that's very inspiring because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>means that you can start from where you </v>

99
00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:10.480
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
