00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Hello Dr Peterson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been trying to listen to my </v>

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.951
<v Speaker 1>conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't tell the difference between </v>

3
00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:09.230
<v Speaker 1>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>willful blindness or genuine conscience.</v>

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I would say about that </v>

5
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.260
<v Speaker 1>is it is quite clear that you are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact trying to listen to your conscience</v>

6
00:00:15.261 --> 00:00:18.140
<v Speaker 1>because that's probably the first thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you discover,</v>

7
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Speaker 1>so that's a really good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>here's a test and you don't want to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this stupidly.</v>

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 1>If you think that you should do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something and you think that the reason </v>

11
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>you might not be doing it is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid,</v>

12
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 1>then you should do it.</v>

13
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.540
<v Speaker 1>So that way you can find out if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>

14
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think your question is,</v>

15
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:53.571
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I know my conscience isn't just </v>

16
00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:53.571
<v Speaker 1>masquerading as fear saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

17
00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:55.800
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's rationalizing the real issue,</v>

18
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:58.260
<v Speaker 1>which is you're afraid of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

19
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a reason that you want to tell </v>

20
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 1>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I parked.</v>

21
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>I kind of figured this out when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking deeply into the Pinocchio Story.</v>

22
00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>You know when Pinocchio as Pinocchio </v>
<v Speaker 1>strives to become real,</v>

23
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a conscience to guide him,</v>

24
00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's jimminy cricket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this insect,</v>

25
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>but Gemini isn't really a very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience.</v>

26
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>He's a bit dogmatic to begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dogmatic and didn't experienced,</v>

27
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.530
<v Speaker 1>and so it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the conscience is an </v>

28
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.201
<v Speaker 1>unerring guide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a partner in discovery and as </v>

29
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:35.331
<v Speaker 1>you move forward in your life and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>consult your conscience and you listened</v>

30
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:39.780
<v Speaker 1>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it gets smarter and so to you,</v>

31
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.500
<v Speaker 1>but there's a Coda there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I've suggested part of </v>

32
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.990
<v Speaker 1>the reason why I've suggested so </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently in my lectures and in my book</v>

33
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.030
<v Speaker 1>that people try not to lie.</v>

34
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.790
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many systems.</v>

35
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:58.791
<v Speaker 1>You have many systems within.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that guide you and one of </v>

36
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:04.341
<v Speaker 1>those is your capacity for rational </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought and then you have a variety of </v>

37
00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:07.221
<v Speaker 1>emotional systems and motivational </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems and internal dramas and </v>

38
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>intuitions and bodily sensations like </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots and lots of incenses.</v>

39
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Lots of systems that are guiding you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of them operate.</v>

40
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unconsciously,</v>

41
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>autonomously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instinctively,</v>

42
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>implicitly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

43
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Now you pr nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you programmed them like you feed them </v>

44
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.931
<v Speaker 1>content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say just like you feed your body </v>

45
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:38.721
<v Speaker 1>nourishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feed them content and a lot of the </v>

46
00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:41.661
<v Speaker 1>content that you feed them pertains </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly to your voluntary thoughts and </v>

47
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:46.140
<v Speaker 1>speech and your actions and then if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologize those by lying,</v>

48
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.380
<v Speaker 1>so if you say things that you know not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be true or you don't say things that </v>

49
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.981
<v Speaker 1>you know to be true when you need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more common and if you act in </v>

50
00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:59.400
<v Speaker 1>ways that you consider that an act in </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways you considered reprehensible,</v>

51
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.480
<v Speaker 1>then you pathologize all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous systems that guide you.</v>

52
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're programming them badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're building an AI system inside </v>

53
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 1>yourself really in in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense that is what you're doing.</v>

54
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.590
<v Speaker 1>That has very bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very bad training data and so the </v>

55
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.611
<v Speaker 1>output it produces will be will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't guide you properly and so you </v>

56
00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>don't want to pathologize your guidance </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

57
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a really bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you have to not lie and </v>

58
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's also why you have to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have to say and you have to say</v>

59
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 1>clearly as well and you have to learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to do that.</v>

60
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>So that's one of the ways of getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>your conscience straightened out.</v>

61
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to have a dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 1>with your conscience and you might ask.</v>

62
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

63
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:48.691
<v Speaker 1>well what should I do or what should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should I do this or should I not do </v>

64
00:03:48.691 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're thinking,</v>

65
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>should I not do this?</v>

66
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 1>In the case of a temptation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have a chance to develop a new</v>

67
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

68
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're excited about it and apprehensive</v>

69
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 1>about it and afraid of it and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to sort out all those feelings.</v>

70
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing is you really have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to want to sort them out.</v>

71
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>That's why you have to orient yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>to something that's a genuine up.</v>

72
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>You know that the star above the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horizon,</v>

73
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:19.411
<v Speaker 1>you have to really want things to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight and you have to have thought </v>

74
00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:24.121
<v Speaker 1>that through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to know what it means for </v>

75
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:27.421
<v Speaker 1>things not to be straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really what it means is that you're </v>

76
00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 1>headed for hell in one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you understand that it's enough,</v>

77
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's enough to scare you straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really gotta think that through.</v>

78
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got to think about how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>better it would be if you aimed up and </v>

79
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 1>and that really has to kind of permeate </v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole being.</v>

80
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.100
<v Speaker 1>And so then you're oriented that way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're oriented to adopt and you're </v>

81
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 1>deciding that it's okay to try to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth and then you can start to rely</v>

82
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:51.061
<v Speaker 1>on this dialogue with your conscience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But both of you have to learn and you're</v>

83
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:54.340
<v Speaker 1>gonna make mistakes along the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that's okay.</v>

84
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

85
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try this without being </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain that it's right.</v>

86
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.730
<v Speaker 1>You can even say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say this without being </v>

87
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.520
<v Speaker 1>certain that it's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're arguing with your wife or</v>

88
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:06.070
<v Speaker 1>your husband or your or your sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your father,</v>

89
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 1>and you have an idea about what might be</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

90
00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:10.810
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

91
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.890
<v Speaker 1>here's my idea about what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows what that idea might be </v>

92
00:05:17.141 --> 00:05:22.141
<v Speaker 1>contaminated with like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'm putting it forward just </v>

93
00:05:22.141 --> 00:05:24.631
<v Speaker 1>because I'm too proud or arrogant or </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry or fearful or whatever that's </v>

94
00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:25.090
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

95
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can offer it tentatively and </v>

96
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>both have at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do.</v>

97
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:34.240
<v Speaker 1>If it's a hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

98
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:37.270
<v Speaker 1>You both have at it and see if it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that's worthy of,</v>

99
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.270
<v Speaker 1>of keeping you do that with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience.</v>

100
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.250
<v Speaker 1>And then you were moved forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

101
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a technique in behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology called psychotherapy called </v>

102
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.610
<v Speaker 1>collaborative empiricism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that we,</v>

103
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.270
<v Speaker 1>you and I have been sitting down and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided that you're going to try </v>

104
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.641
<v Speaker 1>something new this week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe your agoraphobic and you're </v>

105
00:05:59.641 --> 00:06:02.861
<v Speaker 1>having a hard time in a parking lot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so getting out of the car and going to </v>

106
00:06:02.861 --> 00:06:03.260
<v Speaker 1>the grocery store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe we say,</v>

107
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

108
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.080
<v Speaker 1>drive to the grocery store and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just gonna walk halfway to the two,</v>

109
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 1>halfway from your car to the door and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good enough for like,</v>

110
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>do that every second day for a week and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then come back and let's talk about it.</v>

111
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.950
<v Speaker 1>So that's collaborative empiricism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're running little experiments,</v>

112
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.070
<v Speaker 1>you think what your conscience is </v>
<v Speaker 1>guiding you towards something.</v>

113
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>You take a tentative step in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction and then you check and see,</v>

114
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:27.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>did what I wanted to have happen or </v>
<v Speaker 1>occur as an outcome.</v>

116
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.760
<v Speaker 1>That's the crucial question and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crucial question for behavioral </v>

117
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.760
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

118
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.691
<v Speaker 1>That's the pragmatic perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did what I want to have happened happen </v>

119
00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Speaker 1>as a consequence of my framework of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation and my action.</v>

120
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 1>If the answer is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I have not invalidated it.</v>

121
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

122
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.610
<v Speaker 1>that's the pragmatic philosophy in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutshell.</v>

123
00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:53.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

124
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:58.541
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have a dialogue with your </v>

125
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 1>conscience that never ends and hopefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets wiser and you get wiser.</v>

126
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.320
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

127
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.100
<v Speaker 1>that's the dialogue that young talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about between the conscious and the </v>

128
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.100
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between your,</v>

129
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.380
<v Speaker 1>your fantasy life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say the life that sort of underneath you</v>

130
00:07:19.381 --> 00:07:23.550
<v Speaker 1>as a conscious being like the life </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of your biological platform,</v>

131
00:07:23.551 --> 00:07:28.551
<v Speaker 1>the biological platform that somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>miraculously gives rise to your </v>

132
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:30.690
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a dialogue with that.</v>

133
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.370
<v Speaker 1>We're always in dialogue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're always in dialogue,</v>

134
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.660
<v Speaker 1>right with everything,</v>

135
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.160
<v Speaker 2>so pursue that.</v>
