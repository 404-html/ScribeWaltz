1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Ideologies are fragmented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religions are essentially,</v>

2
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:04.610
<v Speaker 1>they use the same symbolic under </v>
<v Speaker 1>structured,</v>

3
00:00:04.611 --> 00:00:07.320
<v Speaker 1>but they only tell part of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you a quick example of that.</v>

4
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I'll do it very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the American West was settled,</v>

5
00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>it was settled on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the wave of an ideological story,</v>

6
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.670
<v Speaker 1>and here's the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heroic individual that's positive,</v>

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>bringing positive culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the wise king into virgin </v>

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.550
<v Speaker 1>oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic territory.</v>

9
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.470
<v Speaker 1>That's the negative mother essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's positive individual,</v>

10
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.510
<v Speaker 1>positive culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative nature,</v>

11
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.270
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's.</v>

12
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a motivating story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

13
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>To bring heroically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring order into the untamed wilderness.</v>

14
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like a million people a year from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>

15
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Come driven by that narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

16
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.230
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well here's the counter narrative raping</v>

17
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:51.231
<v Speaker 1>and pillaging individual bringing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>desolations of tyrannical culture into </v>

18
00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>the virginal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful environmental.</v>

19
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.860
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

20
00:00:56.861 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 1>What would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A hystopia of nature.</v>

21
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>

22
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>you can get a long way with that story </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

23
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.120
<v Speaker 1>but they're both half the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you just put those two things </v>

24
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.120
<v Speaker 1>together and you have a religious story.</v>

25
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like while the individual is heroic</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also is an adversary and accrual </v>

26
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 1>adversary at that culture is the wise </v>
<v Speaker 1>king,</v>

27
00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the evil tyrant and nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>is beautiful and wonderful friendship,</v>

28
00:01:19.711 --> 00:01:24.711
<v Speaker 1>impressionistic landscape and cancer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>anopheles mosquitoes and they </v>

29
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 1>elephantiasis and so if you are properly</v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented in the world,</v>

30
00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 1>you tell yourself both those stories and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

31
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they conflict.</v>

32
00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

33
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

34
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:37.011
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So an etiology just pulls out a subset </v>

35
00:01:37.011 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>of the religious characters and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the entire reality.</v>

36
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

37
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:42.240
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a parasitical.</v>

38
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a parasitical meme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially an ideology is a parasitical</v>

39
00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:47.280
<v Speaker 1>meme on a religious substructure.</v>
