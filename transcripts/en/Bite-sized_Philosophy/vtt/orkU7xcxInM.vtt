1
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the sun devouring father,</v>

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.730
<v Speaker 1>that's a painting by Medina of Satan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty horrifying one,</v>

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.680
<v Speaker 1>and that's Captain Hook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the figure of Captain </v>

4
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Hook some of these popular mythological </v>
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>

5
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:22.731
<v Speaker 1>Myths based fairytales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Modern fairy tales have got things </v>

6
00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:22.731
<v Speaker 1>really right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Captain Hook.</v>

7
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a pirate.</v>

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.290
<v Speaker 1>So I think I told you that in the Google</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineers investigations of female </v>

9
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:35.841
<v Speaker 1>sexual fantasies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pirate played a large role werewolf </v>

10
00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>vampire pirate surgeon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billionaire credibly comic comical,</v>

11
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>well pirate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.030
<v Speaker 1>captain of the high seas and someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to break rules.</v>

13
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>There's a romance in that figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>so the idea of the great father as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pirate is a good one.</v>

15
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kirk is kind of a pathetic pirate and of</v>

16
00:00:52.861 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>course pirates are precisely that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're all crooked.</v>

17
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.740
<v Speaker 1>And so what makes empathetic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it isn't because he's got a hook </v>

18
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>precisely because maybe that's just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sign of adventure.</v>

19
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.840
<v Speaker 1>It's because he's being chased by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>crocodile with a clock in its stomach.</v>

20
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the dragon of chaos right now.</v>

21
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.800
<v Speaker 1>It's time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tick,</v>

22
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>tick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tick.</v>

23
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Your life is going to end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already got a piece of you and it's</v>

24
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>coming for the rest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the hook is terrified of that.</v>

25
00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 1>He's terrified into resentment and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and evil,</v>

26
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why he can prey on other people.</v>

27
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the father in the Peter </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pan Story out in Neverland,</v>

28
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:31.580
<v Speaker 1>which is the archetypal domain captain </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hook's the farther,</v>

29
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would peter pan want to grow up to </v>

30
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.890
<v Speaker 1>be Captain Hook?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

31
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so he stays.</v>

32
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Pan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pan Means everything,</v>

33
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like pantheism,</v>

34
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>he stays everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's this divine child.</v>

35
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:45.780
<v Speaker 1>He never wants to grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

36
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:50.781
<v Speaker 1>why would you sacrifice the potential of</v>
<v Speaker 1>youth to become nothing but a death </v>

37
00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>obsessed tyrant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

38
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>that's the story in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Peter Pan,</v>

39
00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>and of course Wendy's in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so as Tinkerbell,</v>

40
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>tinkerbell is the imagined feminine.</v>

41
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.300
<v Speaker 1>She's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't even exist.</v>

42
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:08.301
<v Speaker 1>She's just this perfect little thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's always around whenever Peter Pan </v>

43
00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:11.961
<v Speaker 1>needs her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with Tinkerbell is that </v>

44
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>she's a fairy and fairies don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has wendy there.</v>

45
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.410
<v Speaker 1>She's a real girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When she grows up and actually marry </v>

46
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.181
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Pan Stays King of the lost boys </v>

47
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:21.540
<v Speaker 1>forever and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's better to be king of the lost</v>

48
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not to be king it all,</v>

49
00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:27.780
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not to king of the dam does </v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly something to.</v>

50
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not a dominance hierarchy to strive</v>
<v Speaker 1>for dominating.</v>

51
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>So that's the Peter Pan Story and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

52
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>It's the right story for the modern age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

53
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>So that's a negative element of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great father.</v>

54
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Here's the positive element of the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

55
00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:50.341
<v Speaker 1>These are both read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a representation of Moses </v>

56
00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:51.760
<v Speaker 1>receiving the the rules for living from </v>
<v Speaker 1>God on high.</v>

57
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>What we talked about that already know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see that that's a story of the </v>

58
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.051
<v Speaker 1>revelation of structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of we're acting out a </v>

59
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>moral structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

60
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:07.381
<v Speaker 1>what is it now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we get a glimpse of what the </v>

61
00:03:07.381 --> 00:03:09.961
<v Speaker 1>moral structure isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hits people with the force of a </v>

62
00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:09.961
<v Speaker 1>revelation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it can be articulated,</v>

63
00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:11.750
<v Speaker 1>and that's partly what the story of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Moses lays out.</v>

64
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.690
<v Speaker 1>When you see here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this picture,</v>

65
00:03:14.691 --> 00:03:17.510
<v Speaker 1>I really liked this one too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a supplicant,</v>

66
00:03:17.511 --> 00:03:21.020
<v Speaker 1>basically someone who's who's hit hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>by a divine vision.</v>

67
00:03:21.021 --> 00:03:22.730
<v Speaker 1>It's God in heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

68
00:03:22.731 --> 00:03:25.490
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar to this with with the cross</v>

69
00:03:25.491 --> 00:03:30.491
<v Speaker 1>in the background and it's something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that to transcend your littleness </v>

70
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.830
<v Speaker 1>because look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's looking up.</v>

71
00:03:31.831 --> 00:03:36.831
<v Speaker 1>That's what's at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy is what at the top </v>

72
00:03:36.831 --> 00:03:38.790
<v Speaker 1>of all possible dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look up.</v>

73
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.930
<v Speaker 1>That's the father who supports the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden,</v>

74
00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:43.970
<v Speaker 1>that's transcending his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability,</v>

75
00:03:43.971 --> 00:03:48.971
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Willing to bear it voluntarily and not </v>

76
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:48.971
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not to shirk from that.</v>

77
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.580
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly right and it is what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>admire in people who you admire,</v>

78
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:56.190
<v Speaker 1>people who are courageous and who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>

79
00:03:56.191 --> 00:04:01.191
<v Speaker 1>and when you decompose that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that they're able to act </v>

80
00:04:01.191 --> 00:04:04.140
<v Speaker 1>appropriately and in a helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassionate,</v>

81
00:04:04.141 --> 00:04:09.141
<v Speaker 1>wise and tough manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite the fact that there'd be set </v>

82
00:04:09.141 --> 00:04:11.190
<v Speaker 1>with all of the problems of mortality </v>
<v Speaker 1>than everyone else.</v>

83
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does it go wrong?</v>

84
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's whole propaganda for Hitler.</v>

85
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Look at the imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

86
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.630
<v Speaker 1>he's a night that's on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the.</v>

87
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>He's the night of nationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

88
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 1>that's God the father too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it's a little bit one sided,</v>

89
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's more to the farther than</v>

90
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 1>the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>

91
00:04:33.131 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>and that's the problem with nationalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's totalitarian variance and we're</v>

92
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 1>moving into that direction fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

93
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:43.951
<v Speaker 1>You see Europe right now fragmenting </v>
<v Speaker 1>again because the European Union is too </v>

94
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:48.571
<v Speaker 1>amorphous and maybe not well enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>bordered and everyone is getting nervous</v>

95
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:51.100
<v Speaker 1>and they're saying back to the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the state,</v>

96
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 1>it's fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

97
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.220
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to be around people who are </v>

98
00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.220
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

99
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 1>that you have built a consensus with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to subordinate yourself to the state</v>

100
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.410
<v Speaker 1>and to make its head that the bearer of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

101
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

102
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 1>the archetype of the night without </v>
<v Speaker 1>having that element of individuality and</v>

103
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:11.470
<v Speaker 1>it is absolutely pathological.</v>

104
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 1>We've already been down that road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

105
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Because the national socialists were </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper national,</v>

106
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:20.790
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh it both in Germany and in Italy and </v>

107
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.790
<v Speaker 1>it's attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

108
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.720
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting here you see Hitler as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a night and up here there's a bird,</v>

109
00:05:24.721 --> 00:05:26.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that bird should be the dove because</v>

110
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:29.080
<v Speaker 1>that should be the holy ghost if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>iconography was proper,</v>

111
00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:34.081
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an eagle and an eagle is a bird of </v>

112
00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:34.540
<v Speaker 1>carrion eater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

113
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.290
<v Speaker 1>It feeds on corpses while it's worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about.</v>

114
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>So that's the woman worshiping the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong father.</v>

115
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Another representation of Hitler as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

116
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:45.570
<v Speaker 1>and then there's Hitler as wise father </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

117
00:05:45.571 --> 00:05:50.571
<v Speaker 1>He is surrounded by people there who </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused in on him as if he's an </v>

118
00:05:50.571 --> 00:05:52.340
<v Speaker 1>architect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archetype will import and then this is a</v>

119
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.650
<v Speaker 1>poster from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the allies,</v>

120
00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.690
<v Speaker 1>Nancy Nazi poster from allies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see right there that Hitler and </v>

121
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 1>the Nazis are assimilated to a massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>predatory snakes.</v>

122
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

123
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:03.650
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

124
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 1>if you want to appeal to someone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>determination to destroy you say,</v>

125
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 1>well here you are in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're already to go.</v>

126
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Let's go kill some snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everyone can say yes,</v>

127
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:16.250
<v Speaker 1>and then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's the snakes right there.</v>

128
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.450
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true to some degree because you,</v>

129
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>you have plenty of snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like everyone else,</v>

130
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.620
<v Speaker 1>and so it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first step towards </v>

131
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.620
<v Speaker 1>demonization and you can do it just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

132
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 1>It's no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The archetype will map perfectly,</v>

133
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 1>especially if there's already tension </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the groups or if the other group</v>

134
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 1>is identifiable in some manner or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can make it identifiable.</v>

135
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Discussed is the best way to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not fear,</v>

136
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 1>disgust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear to fear someone.</v>

137
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:48.071
<v Speaker 1>You have to respect them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to burn everything that </v>

138
00:06:48.071 --> 00:06:52.751
<v Speaker 1>the person that you fear owns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to burn everything that the </v>

139
00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 1>person who disgusts you owns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you'll see people who are pushing</v>

140
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 1>the nationalist agenda hard and Hitler </v>
<v Speaker 1>did this beautifully.</v>

141
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Everything that was outside of the area </v>
<v Speaker 1>and domain of purity wasn't to be </v>

142
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 1>feared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was disgusting.</v>

143
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 1>It was contemptuous and it should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed and purified by fire,</v>

144
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.910
<v Speaker 1>and that was his message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Nazis were unbelievably great at </v>

145
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.330
<v Speaker 1>using fire of purification as a symbolic</v>
<v Speaker 1>message.</v>

146
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has an archetype will power.</v>

147
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.020
<v Speaker 1>Then you see here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an English,</v>

148
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:29.590
<v Speaker 1>a poster from the World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking people to buy bonds to fund </v>

149
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:33.590
<v Speaker 1>the American or the British war effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see these,</v>

150
00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:38.890
<v Speaker 1>these talon like plause Japan and Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany reaching out to the virgin </v>

151
00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:43.100
<v Speaker 1>mother and her infant child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

152
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:48.110
<v Speaker 1>The deep use of deep subordination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of archetipal imagery for the purposes.</v>

153
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.350
<v Speaker 1>While I hesitate to say propaganda </v>
<v Speaker 1>because World War II in some sense was </v>

154
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:54.460
<v Speaker 1>pretty clear cut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

155
00:07:54.461 --> 00:07:57.770
<v Speaker 1>you get the point and there's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>uniform reoccur.</v>

156
00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.780
<v Speaker 1>That uniformity of the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

157
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.690
<v Speaker 1>So the goose step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody moves exactly the same way.</v>

158
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's turned into exactly the same</v>

159
00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:10.811
<v Speaker 1>carbon copy of everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the diversity is pushed out of the </v>

160
00:08:10.811 --> 00:08:14.561
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's subordinated to the supreme leader </v>

161
00:08:14.561 --> 00:08:14.561
<v Speaker 1>in the hierarchy becomes incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>rigid and,</v>

162
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.760
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

163
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

164
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.380
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and homogenous.</v>

165
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.010
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

166
00:08:19.011 --> 00:08:24.011
<v Speaker 1>that's great for fast action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's terrible if you don't know </v>

167
00:08:24.011 --> 00:08:24.011
<v Speaker 1>where you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need some diversity,</v>

168
00:08:24.011 --> 00:08:28.841
<v Speaker 1>needs some flaws in the crystalline </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure in case you're on the wrong </v>

169
00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:32.921
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you can't have everyone </v>

170
00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:36.011
<v Speaker 1>being the supreme leader's acolytes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole bloody thing wanders off in </v>

171
00:08:36.011 --> 00:08:40.091
<v Speaker 1>one direction and because we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right direction to go wandering off </v>

172
00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:42.560
<v Speaker 1>in a single direction is extraordinarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

173
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:47.620
<v Speaker 1>You will eventually fall over a cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's the Nazis use of of light at </v>

174
00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:55.181
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were unbelievably good out there </v>

175
00:08:55.181 --> 00:08:57.550
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is one of the things that made </v>

176
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.550
<v Speaker 1>fascism so difficult to fight because </v>
<v Speaker 1>with communism,</v>

177
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 1>because it was a fully articulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>

178
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:03.180
<v Speaker 1>you could attack it rationally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fascism never really did that.</v>

179
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.850
<v Speaker 1>What they did instead was used ritual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

180
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Huge mass rallies and highly emotionally</v>
<v Speaker 1>supercharged meetings and then the use </v>

181
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:16.791
<v Speaker 1>of light and fire and so Hitler built </v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest parade grounds in human </v>

182
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:22.071
<v Speaker 1>history to host the Nuremberg rallies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he would get in front of them on </v>

183
00:09:22.071 --> 00:09:26.061
<v Speaker 1>this huge stage with with Greek columns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very impressive looking and have blocks </v>

184
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:30.120
<v Speaker 1>of thousands of people organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly orderly.</v>

185
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:33.330
<v Speaker 1>The Germans are good at order in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>is associated with disgust,</v>

186
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:35.550
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly organized,</v>

187
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:40.551
<v Speaker 1>orderly displays complete and then at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night with fire and behind him he would </v>

188
00:09:40.551 --> 00:09:43.740
<v Speaker 1>have all of the search lights from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Luftwaffe,</v>

189
00:09:43.741 --> 00:09:48.120
<v Speaker 1>aligned up dozens of them shooting their</v>
<v Speaker 1>light straight up miles into the sky.</v>

190
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:51.750
<v Speaker 1>So we stand in front of these incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive displays of light.</v>

191
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Long before there were rock shows and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth doing that,</v>

192
00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:57.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was unparalleled in history and,</v>

193
00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 1>and addressed the crowd and it was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>good at addressing the crowd.</v>

194
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.470
<v Speaker 1>He'd say something and if people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening he'd say more of it and if </v>

195
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.470
<v Speaker 1>they were listening you'd say more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

196
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:11.420
<v Speaker 1>And because he was addressing the mob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mob God exactly from Hitler what </v>

197
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.290
<v Speaker 1>they wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we saw what that was like,</v>

198
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:18.291
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred and $20 million people dead </v>

199
00:10:18.291 --> 00:10:18.930
<v Speaker 1>in no time flat and the worst horrors </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were ever perpetrated on people.</v>

200
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because there's no shortage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>perpetrated horrors.</v>
