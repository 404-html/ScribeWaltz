1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.150
<v Speaker 1>It's painful to understand how much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing isn't productive.</v>

2
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:09.780
<v Speaker 1>So I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've done this a couple of times with</v>

3
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:14.781
<v Speaker 1>classrooms full of students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually when I'm lecturing about career </v>

4
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:14.781
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

5
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:14.781
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>how much time do you waste?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I get the class to vote.</v>

7
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.090
<v Speaker 1>How many of you waste a 10 hours a day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 10 percent of the kids will </v>

8
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.231
<v Speaker 1>put up their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting because I don't </v>

9
00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>define what constitutes waste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just asked the question.</v>

10
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.300
<v Speaker 1>So they're diagnosing themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

11
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you're wasting 10 hours a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

12
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm just asking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like given your own attitude,</v>

13
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.550
<v Speaker 1>how much time you wasting 10 hours a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

14
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like 10 percent of the people put </v>
<v Speaker 1>up their hands.</v>

15
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Well when you get to like six hours a </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

16
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Speaker 1>80 percent of the people put up their </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

17
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.180
<v Speaker 1>So then we do the arithmetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

18
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>because I like doing arithmetic with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

19
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.780
<v Speaker 1>People hate arithmetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like doing it.</v>

20
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

21
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>six hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>42 hours a week.</v>

22
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>So let's call that a work week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forty hours a week,</v>

23
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

24
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>that's a work week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say what's your time worth,</v>

25
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>your university student or certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth minimum wage because obviously,</v>

26
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's worth way more than that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you spend a productive hour </v>

27
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.941
<v Speaker 1>when you're 20 than you gain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits of that hour for the rest of </v>

28
00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:17.751
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the compounding effect of </v>

29
00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:17.751
<v Speaker 1>time spent when we were young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I say,</v>

30
00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>well let's assume your time's worth 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks an hour,</v>

31
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Speaker 1>which I think is an underestimate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

32
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Let's call it 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We call it 25,</v>

33
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>but we'll call it 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's $2,000</v>

34
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wasting it's $100,000</v>

35
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

36
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much better would your life be if </v>

37
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.330
<v Speaker 1>you weren't wasting $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year?</v>

38
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

39
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Over 40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$4,000,000.</v>

40
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know it.</v>

41
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 1>Quit wasting time by your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition.</v>

42
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like people shake their heads like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

43
00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I never thought about it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

44
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:49.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it that way.</v>

45
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Don't waste your damn life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

46
00:01:52.381 --> 00:01:57.381
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would people be resistant to that </v>

47
00:01:57.381 --> 00:01:57.381
<v Speaker 1>message?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

48
00:01:57.381 --> 00:01:59.661
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really want to wake up and figure </v>

49
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:00.090
<v Speaker 1>out that you're wasting half your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

50
00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>when people do that kind of wasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually hate it.</v>

51
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.330
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've had lots of people come to my </v>

52
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.330
<v Speaker 1>clinical practice who were chronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>procrastinators,</v>

53
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they're watching youtube videos </v>

54
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.010
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

55
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>but not ones that are good for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although sometimes they will do that,</v>

56
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:19.290
<v Speaker 1>but just browsing and that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mindless way that you do when you're not</v>

57
00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>paying attention and you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kill time and people doing that,</v>

58
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:25.020
<v Speaker 1>they feel bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get depressed,</v>

59
00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>they feel anxious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't get away from it.</v>

60
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.450
<v Speaker 1>They feel kind of addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saying about social media now.</v>

61
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:32.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge issue with young kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

62
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.910
<v Speaker 1>But there's this feeling of kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal rot and corruption that goes </v>

63
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.910
<v Speaker 1>along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

64
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you're wasting your life.</v>

65
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.530
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's painful.</v>

66
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.980
<v Speaker 1>It's painful to recognize that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it's painful to think,</v>

67
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how undisciplined I am.</v>

68
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't use this schedule.</v>

69
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.960
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't stick to a calendar.</v>

70
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any aims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about the world.</v>

71
00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe there's a part of me that's </v>

72
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>bitter because I haven't got everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>already and I'd like to say to hell with</v>

73
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:06.001
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the recognition of the union </v>

74
00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:07.831
<v Speaker 1>shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's what makes you a </v>

75
00:03:07.831 --> 00:03:07.831
<v Speaker 1>vicious and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

76
00:03:07.831 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and untrustworthy all of that.</v>

77
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>No one wants to look at that and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody wonder.</v>

78
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>But Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alternative is worse.</v>
