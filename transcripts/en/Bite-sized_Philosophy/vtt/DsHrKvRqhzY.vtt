00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.560
<v Speaker 1>What's my advice to young men seeking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman for marriage and family?</v>

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:08.010
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

4
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.260
<v Speaker 1>That's the same question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second question.</v>

5
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.120
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty straightforward man.</v>

6
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:17.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't eliminate the necessity of </v>

7
00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>being attracted to one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's important.</v>

8
00:00:17.911 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's mysterious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

9
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>

10
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:23.520
<v Speaker 1>here's a funny thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

11
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.970
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we know that attracts </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to one another is bilateral </v>

12
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.001
<v Speaker 1>symmetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you take men and you ranked </v>

13
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:36.261
<v Speaker 1>them by the symmetry of their faces and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you give the asymmetrical men tee </v>

14
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:43.101
<v Speaker 1>shirts to wear clean t shirts for a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the symmetrical men clean t shirts </v>

15
00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:47.661
<v Speaker 1>to wear for a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you give the t shirts to women </v>

16
00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>and you have them rate the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the odor,</v>

17
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.270
<v Speaker 1>the women rate the odor of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>symmetrical men as more attractive than </v>

18
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.540
<v Speaker 1>the odor of the asymmetrical man.</v>

19
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.050
<v Speaker 1>And then there were other factors that </v>
<v Speaker 1>determined sexual attractiveness that </v>

20
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:05.241
<v Speaker 1>are based on biological factors that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that deeply embedded in terms of </v>

21
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:05.310
<v Speaker 1>smell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

22
00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:09.580
<v Speaker 1>So a women also tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>not be sexually attracted to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the scent of men whose,</v>

24
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.230
<v Speaker 1>who have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

25
00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:21.231
<v Speaker 1>it's rh factors that would make for </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential trouble in childbirth.</v>

26
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.410
<v Speaker 1>And the often the reason that the women </v>
<v Speaker 1>give for not preferring the scent of </v>

27
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.610
<v Speaker 1>those men is that they smell too much </v>
<v Speaker 1>like their brother,</v>

28
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was weird,</v>

29
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:37.251
<v Speaker 1>mysterious things that determine whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not people are sexually and </v>

30
00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:40.251
<v Speaker 1>physically attracted to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's very important that </v>

31
00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:43.071
<v Speaker 1>that's part of a marital relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next most important thing is trust.</v>

32
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there,</v>

33
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 1>there's no marriage that's successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>without trust you guys.</v>

34
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 1>You got to tell each other the truth.</v>

35
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.950
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons that you'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that marriage as a,</v>

36
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>an oath and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl Jung as a bond was necessary.</v>

37
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>It's really wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

38
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling the truth to someone is no </v>

39
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.930
<v Speaker 1>simple thing because there's a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things about all of us that are terrible</v>

40
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:10.140
<v Speaker 1>and weak and reprehensible and shameful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of those things.</v>

41
00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:15.141
<v Speaker 1>And they kind of have to be brought out </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the open and dealt with and you're </v>

42
00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:19.611
<v Speaker 1>not going to tell the truth about </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to someone who can run away </v>

43
00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:22.821
<v Speaker 1>screaming when you reveal who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the marriage bond is something </v>

44
00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:23.670
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

45
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.700
<v Speaker 1>here's the deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to handcuff myself to you and </v>

46
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.321
<v Speaker 1>you're going to handcuff yourself to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we're going to tell each other </v>

47
00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:34.410
<v Speaker 1>the truth and neither of us are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to run away.</v>

48
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>And so our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once we know the truth,</v>

49
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:41.901
<v Speaker 1>then we're either going to live together</v>
<v Speaker 1>in mutual tournament or we're going to </v>

50
00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:44.691
<v Speaker 1>try to deal with that truth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>straighten ourselves out and straighten </v>

51
00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:44.691
<v Speaker 1>ourselves out jointly.</v>

52
00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:49.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's gonna make us more powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more resilient and more and deeper </v>

53
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:53.220
<v Speaker 1>and wiser as we progress together </v>
<v Speaker 1>through life.</v>

54
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.590
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's absolutely brilliant </v>

55
00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.590
<v Speaker 1>because if you leave the backdoor open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

56
00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>you're going to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

57
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.170
<v Speaker 1>And the oath is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was [inaudible] commentary on </v>

58
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.561
<v Speaker 1>the spiritualization of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the human pair and by Christian </v>

59
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

60
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.310
<v Speaker 1>which emphasized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

62
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subordination of both members of the</v>

63
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:20.641
<v Speaker 1>marital union to a higher order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a personality that was embodied in the </v>

64
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:24.690
<v Speaker 1>figure of the logos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that in,</v>

65
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.130
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

66
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 1>in the Christian marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

67
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 1>the man isn't the boss and the woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the boss.</v>

68
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.610
<v Speaker 1>The boss is the mutual personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>composed by the seeking of truth in both</v>

69
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:39.430
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's conceptualized as their,</v>

70
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 1>their joint subjugation to the logos.</v>

71
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.650
<v Speaker 1>And that is absolutely dead on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the ruler of your marital life</v>

72
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:51.991
<v Speaker 1>should be your vow to tell each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth because like in hard times </v>

73
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:57.301
<v Speaker 1>during your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you've done something stupid and </v>

74
00:03:57.301 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>idiotic might take you down and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have anybody that you can turn to.</v>

75
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a partner that you can </v>

76
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.780
<v Speaker 1>trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go say,</v>

77
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.780
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.440
<v Speaker 1>I made a big financial mistake man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really torturing me and I feel </v>

79
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 1>like a complete idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really dangerous and the person</v>

80
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:14.221
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to help you figure out what </v>

81
00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>to do about it and they're going to know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when they make a stupid mistake and</v>

82
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:19.711
<v Speaker 1>they're bloody well going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can come and talk to you and </v>

83
00:04:19.711 --> 00:04:22.350
<v Speaker 1>that you guys are going to work your way</v>
<v Speaker 1>through it and that's a big deal and </v>

84
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of things our culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets really wrong and one is it devalues</v>

85
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>

86
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.990
<v Speaker 1>That's really a very bad idea because </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriages,</v>

87
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.380
<v Speaker 1>marriages like a third of your life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe more and kids are a third of your </v>

88
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 1>life and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

89
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 1>your life outside of marriage and kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a third of your life.</v>

90
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>approximately speaking and to miss any </v>

91
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 1>of that is a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive mistake.</v>

92
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>

93
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I will also say that for some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>missing one or more of those is </v>

94
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.620
<v Speaker 1>necessary because they have a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're brilliantly creative </v>

95
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.271
<v Speaker 1>artists and they need to devote </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves entirely to their career or </v>

96
00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:03.570
<v Speaker 1>they're outstanding in some way and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they need.</v>

97
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.610
<v Speaker 1>They can justify the sacrifice of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that tryout of being to another </v>

98
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:09.460
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for,</v>

99
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.730
<v Speaker 1>but generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very dangerous thing and it,</v>

100
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't be done.</v>

101
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 1>And also kids get an absolutely terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>rap,</v>

102
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because kids are delightful.</v>

103
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.960
<v Speaker 1>If they're well behaved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the chapters in my new book is </v>

104
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>called don't let your children do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that makes you dislike them and</v>

105
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.710
<v Speaker 1>you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you discuss it thoroughly </v>

106
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.531
<v Speaker 1>with your spouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the person that's helping you </v>

107
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:37.141
<v Speaker 1>discipline the kids and children are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best company because they're really </v>

108
00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:39.490
<v Speaker 1>enthusiastic about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love doing new things.</v>

109
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 1>They really love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're happy that you're around.</v>

110
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is make sure they're </v>

111
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.310
<v Speaker 1>not too hot and they're not too cold and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've had something to eat and they're</v>

112
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:53.311
<v Speaker 1>not too tired and you don't expect them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stay engaged in something for longer </v>

113
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:59.101
<v Speaker 1>than they can manage because we used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take our kids when they were little out </v>

114
00:05:59.101 --> 00:06:01.921
<v Speaker 1>to for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they could sit there no problem and </v>

115
00:06:01.921 --> 00:06:01.921
<v Speaker 1>behave really nicely when they were two </v>
<v Speaker 1>and three.</v>

116
00:06:01.921 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 1>But they couldn't do it for more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>about 45 minutes.</v>

117
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.580
<v Speaker 1>He can't push your luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also noticed with little kids is </v>

118
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.971
<v Speaker 1>that they got antsy and unreasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>about five to 10 minutes before the </v>

119
00:06:12.971 --> 00:06:17.771
<v Speaker 1>adults did too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the adults were too stupid to </v>

120
00:06:17.771 --> 00:06:17.771
<v Speaker 1>notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids would notice right away.</v>

121
00:06:17.771 --> 00:06:18.200
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

122
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.680
<v Speaker 1>so back to marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look for someone that you're </v>

123
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.680
<v Speaker 1>attracted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you love,</v>

124
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 1>and then you look for someone that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can bloody well,</v>

125
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:27.420
<v Speaker 1>trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you tell them the truth and,</v>

126
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.640
<v Speaker 1>and that way maybe you can get through </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and you can have someone to weave </v>

127
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 1>the rope of your being with and together</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make,</v>

128
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.810
<v Speaker 1>to make your joint ropes stronger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have some continuity in your </v>

129
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.770
<v Speaker 1>narrative and you can have children and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can have grandchildren and like</v>

130
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:45.320
<v Speaker 1>you can have a life man and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

131
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.110
<v Speaker 1>You're so fortunate if you can manage </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

132
00:06:48.111 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

133
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:53.270
<v Speaker 1>So there's that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's my advice to young men seeking</v>

134
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:55.130
<v Speaker 1>a woman for marriage and family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

135
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also,</v>

136
00:06:57.261 --> 00:07:02.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marry someone you think would be a good </v>

137
00:07:02.261 --> 00:07:02.261
<v Speaker 1>mother and that has enough sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

138
00:07:02.261 --> 00:07:03.860
<v Speaker 1>to know that she wants children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

139
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.920
<v Speaker 1>some women don't want children and fair </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough and some women perhaps shouldn't </v>

140
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.210
<v Speaker 1>have children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also possible,</v>

141
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.240
<v Speaker 1>but the general rule of thumb is </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially once a woman in her mid </v>

142
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.520
<v Speaker 1>twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she doesn't know that she wants </v>

143
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.371
<v Speaker 1>children or wounded admitted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless she has a viciously important </v>

144
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:28.760
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then she's not oriented properly.</v>

145
00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Psychologically she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

146
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:35.170
<v Speaker 1>she isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't know what's important in </v>

147
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:35.170
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

148
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.230
<v Speaker 1>that might also be the case with you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably is,</v>

149
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 1>but as a rule of thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good one.</v>
