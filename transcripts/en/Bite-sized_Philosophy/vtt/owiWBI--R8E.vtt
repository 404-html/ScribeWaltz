1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.710
<v Speaker 1>One of the things you pointed out too </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that what you most need to know will</v>

2
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:09.711
<v Speaker 1>be found where you least want to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because you haven't already </v>

3
00:00:09.711 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>looked there and so it's a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>different for everyone,</v>

4
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because your particular place you'd want</v>

5
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>to look isn't going to be the same as </v>
<v Speaker 1>your place,</v>

6
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.380
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to have a place you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to look and what you haven't </v>

7
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.801
<v Speaker 1>discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it is and so that's all </v>

8
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:26.670
<v Speaker 1>partly going to be discovered by you </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at what you're capable of,</v>

9
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:31.671
<v Speaker 1>what you're truly capable of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know people especially on the </v>

10
00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:32.550
<v Speaker 1>compassionate and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

11
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:37.551
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could never be like brutal like that </v>

12
00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:40.401
<v Speaker 1>and that could be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can kill people with compassion </v>

13
00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:40.401
<v Speaker 1>and no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens.</v>

14
00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:44.330
<v Speaker 1>That's the Freudian eatable situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think about working in a nursing </v>

15
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.330
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

16
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.190
<v Speaker 1>So there's actually a rule of thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I also use to guide my </v>

17
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>interactions with children and also with</v>
<v Speaker 1>my clients.</v>

18
00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:54.801
<v Speaker 1>And I would say with people in general </v>
<v Speaker 1>do not do anything for anyone that they </v>

19
00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>can do themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you do is steal you.</v>

20
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Just steal it from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you're working with really </v>

21
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.720
<v Speaker 1>elderly people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they have Alzheimer's.</v>

22
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like really easy to do things for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them because while it isn't,</v>

23
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.520
<v Speaker 1>because it's really a hard job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might be easier to do something </v>

24
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>for them then to let them struggle </v>
<v Speaker 1>through it,</v>

25
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 1>but you just speed their device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

26
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:19.761
<v Speaker 1>By taking away the last vestiges of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their independence and you do the same </v>

27
00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>thing with kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like struggle through it.</v>

28
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see my left foot?</v>

29
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a great movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about this author whose name </v>

30
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.450
<v Speaker 1>escapes me at the moment.</v>

31
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.950
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's brilliant movie and the person who </v>

32
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.740
<v Speaker 1>who played the part is Daniel Day Lewis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he went to academy award for it,</v>

33
00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's about this author in Ireland </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was.</v>

34
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>I think he had cerebral palsy and all he</v>
<v Speaker 1>could really do was use his left foot.</v>

35
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of him was pretty spastic and </v>

36
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>not in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not controllable,</v>

37
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>but he was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was very intelligent.</v>

38
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>He was with it and his dad would not </v>
<v Speaker 1>help him.</v>

39
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>He had to drag himself up the damn </v>
<v Speaker 1>stairs with his left foot.</v>

40
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.710
<v Speaker 1>He just would not help him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happened was he learned how to </v>

41
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.710
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.540
<v Speaker 1>he actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't function and the movie does </v>

43
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.991
<v Speaker 1>the book which is called my left foot </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the movie does a lovely job of </v>

44
00:02:11.991 --> 00:02:15.681
<v Speaker 1>laying that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be one hard hearted son </v>

45
00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:18.171
<v Speaker 1>of a bitch to let your sudden crawl up </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stairs with his left foot over and </v>

46
00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:19.290
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about that,</v>

47
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>but what's the alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

48
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.930
<v Speaker 1>if he would have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course he lays this out in the </v>

49
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.930
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he would have been catered to,</v>

50
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.110
<v Speaker 1>he would have ended up just like you'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>expect someone who is always catered to.</v>

51
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very nice lesson in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>triumph of fostering independence over </v>

52
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over to casual compassion.</v>

53
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>That's what I would say.</v>
