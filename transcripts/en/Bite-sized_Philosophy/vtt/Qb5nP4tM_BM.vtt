1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.220
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might've heard about bf skinner,</v>

2
00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:07.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used food pellets to motivate his </v>

3
00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:07.221
<v Speaker 1>rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you don't know about skinner is</v>

4
00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>that those rats were starved to three </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarters of their normal body weight.</v>

5
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.690
<v Speaker 1>So they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would work for food and so </v>

6
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:15.950
<v Speaker 1>skinner's routes were kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>oversimplified,</v>

7
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.440
<v Speaker 1>but you can get rats to work for food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to be that hungry.</v>

8
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>You can get them to work for food and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do all sorts of things.</v>

9
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:26.511
<v Speaker 1>They'll press leavers and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll open our open doors and </v>

10
00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:30.681
<v Speaker 1>they'll solve problems and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do all sorts of things and one </v>

11
00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:34.941
<v Speaker 1>of the things you can do to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure how much the rat is motivated </v>

12
00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you've run them through a maze</v>

13
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>and he knows there's some food at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the maze.</v>

14
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>You can tie a little spring to his tail </v>
<v Speaker 1>and see how hard he polls when you </v>

15
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>opened the door to the maze.</v>

16
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.530
<v Speaker 1>So that's because that's how much rat </v>
<v Speaker 1>work the route is willing to do.</v>

17
00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:51.531
<v Speaker 1>So you can measure that or you can see </v>
<v Speaker 1>how fast he skitters down in the maze </v>

18
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:54.831
<v Speaker 1>and you can get an estimate about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rats motivation and so then you might </v>

19
00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how motivated is a hungry rat?</v>

20
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.970
<v Speaker 1>And the answer would be depends on how </v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry is,</v>

21
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.060
<v Speaker 1>but there's another answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also depends on what's chasing him </v>

22
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.911
<v Speaker 1>when he's going after the food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a rat and you have food </v>

23
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>over here and you walked in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some cat older rats,</v>

24
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>hate cat odor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's innate.</v>

25
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.200
<v Speaker 1>They never have to see or smell acat to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be absolutely petrified by cat odor.</v>

26
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.740
<v Speaker 1>And so if you walked in some cat odor </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then opened the door,</v>

27
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>that rat will zoom to that food a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>faster than it will if it's just hungry.</v>

28
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.310
<v Speaker 1>So a rat running away from something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it doesn't want toward something </v>

29
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>that it does want is a very motivated </v>
<v Speaker 1>rat.</v>

30
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.330
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things we did with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future authoring program that's Germane </v>

31
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:39.140
<v Speaker 1>to this idea of terror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's a.</v>

32
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.170
<v Speaker 1>there's this idea in the Old Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fear of God is the beginning of </v>

33
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.870
<v Speaker 1>wisdom and it's a pretty harsh idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

34
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.930
<v Speaker 1>but there's something really useful </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it because one of the things you </v>

35
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.721
<v Speaker 1>see with people all the time is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there maybe they're trying to stumble </v>

36
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:57.240
<v Speaker 1>forward towards their ideal as poorly </v>
<v Speaker 1>defined as it might be,</v>

37
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.760
<v Speaker 1>but then they're afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

38
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.880
<v Speaker 1>They're afraid about what they might </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter and that stops them because </v>

39
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.370
<v Speaker 1>fear does stop people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It freezes you like a prey on them and </v>

40
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.000
<v Speaker 1>so people move ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they get afraid and then they </v>

41
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.711
<v Speaker 1>start moving ahead and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not so good because negative </v>

42
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>emotion is a really powerful motivator.</v>

43
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.980
<v Speaker 1>So we're more motivated by negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion than positive emotion.</v>

44
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Quantitatively speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantitative,</v>

45
00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:24.661
<v Speaker 1>quantitatively speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can measure that and that's I think </v>

46
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:27.531
<v Speaker 1>because we can only be so happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can really be suffering and </v>

47
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:27.531
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:29.070
<v Speaker 1>so we have to pay more attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative.</v>

49
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's bad because the negative can </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop you.</v>

50
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>And then my clinical practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.910
<v Speaker 1>I often talk to people who are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a difficult life decision and,</v>

52
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.220
<v Speaker 1>and they are weighing out the costs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the benefits of making the life </v>

53
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.220
<v Speaker 1>decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things I always talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>them about is wait a second,</v>

55
00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:50.901
<v Speaker 1>that's an incomplete analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to weigh out the benefits and </v>

56
00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:54.591
<v Speaker 1>the costs of doing this and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>weigh out the costs and benefits of not </v>

57
00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not doing it.</v>

58
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the same as the zero that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you assume that you're with,</v>

59
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because to not make a decision,</v>

60
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.260
<v Speaker 1>it also has a cost and sometimes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cost of not making a decision is far </v>

61
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>worse than the cost of making a </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision,</v>

62
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.680
<v Speaker 1>even if the decision is risky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you can derive </v>

63
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 1>from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is very useful,</v>

64
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that</v>

65
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>this is also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think why it's so useful to </v>

66
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>contemplate your mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

67
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.030
<v Speaker 1>as you're screwed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you do,</v>

68
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that actually frees you,</v>

69
00:03:25.401 --> 00:03:27.350
<v Speaker 1>is that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have power.</v>

70
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has catastrophes,</v>

71
00:03:28.761 --> 00:03:33.761
<v Speaker 1>and you have path b that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes and you don't get to have </v>

72
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:35.570
<v Speaker 1>the no catastrophe path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get to pick which one and that's</v>

73
00:03:35.571 --> 00:03:40.571
<v Speaker 1>really something because if you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's terrible risk associated </v>

74
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:41.900
<v Speaker 1>with everything that you do and don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

75
00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:44.030
<v Speaker 1>then you can afford to take some risks </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not,</v>

76
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all within the arc metaphor.</v>

77
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm still making the case that despite </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that your life is essentially </v>

78
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.540
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

79
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 1>you can make a covenant with the highest</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal and that will take you through it </v>

80
00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.620
<v Speaker 1>the best way possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

81
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm still making that case.</v>

82
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.380
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

83
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.010
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

84
00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:10.011
<v Speaker 1>well I'm trying to make this decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go try to do something </v>

85
00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:10.011
<v Speaker 1>difficult and isn't that terrifying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

86
00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:10.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wait a minute,</v>

87
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.560
<v Speaker 1>what's really terrifying is not doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

88
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.400
<v Speaker 1>And then you think about the cost of not</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

89
00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:20.730
<v Speaker 1>So in the future authoring program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have people do this little meditative</v>

90
00:04:20.731 --> 00:04:21.870
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is okay,</v>

91
00:04:21.871 --> 00:04:25.800
<v Speaker 1>just think about your insufficiencies by</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own definition,</v>

92
00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:30.801
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way that you don't do what you know </v>

93
00:04:30.801 --> 00:04:32.040
<v Speaker 1>you should do about the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that you shouldn't do,</v>

94
00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:34.920
<v Speaker 1>that you know you shouldn't do beyond a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow of a doubt,</v>

95
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:39.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some things like that and that </v>

96
00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:42.071
<v Speaker 1>that's bad habits and poor aim and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the resentment and hatred and </v>

97
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:46.371
<v Speaker 1>aggression and unresolved conflicts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things that are demanding you </v>

98
00:04:46.371 --> 00:04:47.160
<v Speaker 1>in warping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You then think,</v>

99
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:49.290
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things get the upper hand man,</v>

100
00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:54.291
<v Speaker 1>they get the upper hand and they take </v>
<v Speaker 1>you the worst possible place you could </v>

101
00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:54.300
<v Speaker 1>go in the next three to five years.</v>

102
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.360
<v Speaker 1>What exactly does that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you sketch all that out and you </v>

103
00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.360
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

104
00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.861
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the next time that attempt </v>

105
00:05:03.861 --> 00:05:03.861
<v Speaker 1>Taishan comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

106
00:05:03.861 --> 00:05:08.061
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a lot better for me if I didn't </v>

107
00:05:08.061 --> 00:05:08.061
<v Speaker 1>succumb to this temptation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

108
00:05:08.061 --> 00:05:09.180
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd look a little better if you didn't</v>

109
00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:11.430
<v Speaker 1>eat like a cheese cake a day or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

110
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something,</v>

111
00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:15.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

112
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have diabetes and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lose my damn leg and in five years if</v>

113
00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:25.281
<v Speaker 1>I don't get my eating under control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's motivating and so then the </v>

114
00:05:25.281 --> 00:05:26.250
<v Speaker 1>temptation comes along and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

115
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.130
<v Speaker 1>how about no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>

116
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.340
<v Speaker 1>how about no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just because a higher good would be </v>

117
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.211
<v Speaker 1>obtained if I avoided it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of a terrible catastrophe </v>

118
00:05:38.211 --> 00:05:40.740
<v Speaker 1>would be averted if I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so well.</v>

119
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.320
<v Speaker 1>So you want to get your fear behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

120
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.620
<v Speaker 1>You want to get it behind you where it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing you forward instead of in front </v>

121
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.440
<v Speaker 1>of you where it's stopping you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get your fear behind you,</v>

122
00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:54.441
<v Speaker 1>pushing you forward by actually thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the consequences of not putting </v>

123
00:05:54.631 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>your life together and the the least of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those is that you and suffer right?</v>

124
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Because you're going to suffer anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

125
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.290
<v Speaker 1>so you wasted and suffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad deal because maybe if </v>

126
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.971
<v Speaker 1>you're going to suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could at least do something noble </v>

127
00:06:09.971 --> 00:06:12.161
<v Speaker 1>and Glorious and upright and powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and honorable and admirable and helpful </v>

128
00:06:12.331 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 1>and difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

129
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 1>It's just so much better and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good enough so that you think,</v>

130
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:18.800
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

131
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>little suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's basically worth it.</v>

132
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 1>At least it's a way forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

133
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 1>At least it's a way forward.</v>
