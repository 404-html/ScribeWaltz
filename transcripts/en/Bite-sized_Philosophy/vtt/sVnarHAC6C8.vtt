1
00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Rule number 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not bother children when they are </v>

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:05.830
<v Speaker 1>skateboarding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very specific one.</v>

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

4
00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:08.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

5
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.030
<v Speaker 2>that's an essay about masculinity </v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly.</v>

6
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to watch kids skateboard on St </v>

7
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.980
<v Speaker 2>George Street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of cool because obviously </v>

8
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:21.740
<v Speaker 2>St George is the dragon slayer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the street I work on,</v>

9
00:00:21.741 --> 00:00:24.500
<v Speaker 2>which I think is quite funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And anyways,</v>

10
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.270
<v Speaker 2>these kids used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

11
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:28.430
<v Speaker 2>they're teenagers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young teenagers.</v>

12
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.880
<v Speaker 2>We had these long bar hand railings </v>
<v Speaker 2>going down some shallow stairs,</v>

13
00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:39.041
<v Speaker 2>but a fairly good flight to them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would board slide down these </v>

14
00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:39.041
<v Speaker 2>rentals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

15
00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:40.610
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's concrete that's pebbled.</v>

16
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't want to land on.</v>

17
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.100
<v Speaker 1>You probably heard a lot of bones </v>
<v Speaker 1>crunching over the years watching them.</v>

18
00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:45.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

19
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't have much protective </v>

20
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.731
<v Speaker 2>gear on and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and eventually the university put up </v>

21
00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:57.830
<v Speaker 2>things to stop them from doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I complained about in this chapter</v>

22
00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:02.210
<v Speaker 2>for a bunch of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like I liked watching those kids.</v>

23
00:01:02.211 --> 00:01:07.211
<v Speaker 2>I like watching skateboarders do those </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy things because they're trying to </v>

24
00:01:07.211 --> 00:01:09.710
<v Speaker 2>become competent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in there they're facing danger.</v>

25
00:01:09.711 --> 00:01:11.330
<v Speaker 2>They don't want the damn protective </v>
<v Speaker 2>gear,</v>

26
00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:13.970
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes it's just stupidity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like where a damn helmet,</v>

27
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's not.</v>

28
00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:17.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

29
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to wear a helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to expose myself to this danger.</v>

30
00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:24.020
<v Speaker 2>It's not that I'm stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it is,</v>

31
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just being careless,</v>

32
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

33
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.450
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm facing the danger.</v>

34
00:01:29.451 --> 00:01:34.451
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to master it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you watch kids board slide down </v>

35
00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:37.571
<v Speaker 2>like handrails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't think that that's </v>

36
00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:37.970
<v Speaker 2>courageous than your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe stupid.</v>

37
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Those two things aren't so easy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>distinguish,</v>

38
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.970
<v Speaker 2>but it's brave and when they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like amazing.</v>

39
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible to do that.</v>

40
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:47.330
<v Speaker 2>You jump in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you grab your skateboard,</v>

41
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.660
<v Speaker 2>you balance on this stupid rail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you slide for 20 feet and the,</v>

42
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the price for failure as well.</v>

43
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:55.880
<v Speaker 2>You do the splits on the rail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not fun.</v>

44
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you landed</v>

45
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.420
<v Speaker 1>the first one that can change your </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinity.</v>

46
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Masculinity like that.</v>

47
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like,</v>

48
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 2>and the kids are often shooed away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

49
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.780
<v Speaker 2>wait a sec there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're practicing being courageous.</v>

50
00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 2>They're practicing mastering something </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the face of danger,</v>

51
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of the rebellious behavior of </v>

52
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.711
<v Speaker 2>young men in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very frowned upon in the </v>

53
00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:23.190
<v Speaker 2>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's toxic masculinity.</v>

54
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:24.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that horrid,</v>

55
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.310
<v Speaker 2>horrid phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

56
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 2>leave those damn kids alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let them like.</v>

57
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.260
<v Speaker 2>Another thing I referred to in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>chapter is about 10 years ago in </v>

58
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.531
<v Speaker 2>Toronto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they changed the insurance rules </v>

59
00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:42.051
<v Speaker 2>governing the playgrounds and parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>had raised money for these damn </v>

60
00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 2>playground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's nothing wrong with them.</v>

61
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 2>They took them all out the whole city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two weeks before school started.</v>

62
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:48.570
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing but dirt and gravel.</v>

63
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>What happens to her and rubber enough or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't bouncy enough,</v>

64
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>they were too unsafe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

65
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swap.</v>

66
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 2>There was nothing wrong with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then the kids were.</v>

67
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 2>I saw the kids on top of the school </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they needed some danger.</v>

68
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 2>We know that kids on playground </v>
<v Speaker 2>equipment,</v>

69
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 2>they will push to the limit of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability.</v>

70
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 2>That's what you see what you like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you go see a sport like gymnastics,</v>

71
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 2>know what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go see a gymnast and like the gymnast </v>

72
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 2>does a flawless routine and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody claps like Matt and you know,</v>

73
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.120
<v Speaker 2>the judges say nine point nine and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

74
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 2>and then the next person comes up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're screwed.</v>

75
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like nine point nine was basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

76
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 2>How can you do better than perfect?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they do it and,</v>

77
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can do better than perfect </v>

78
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 2>because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the person is like,</v>

79
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 2>they're on the edge and they go out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and you know,</v>

80
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:46.621
<v Speaker 2>you watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel it in your body because you're </v>

81
00:03:46.621 --> 00:03:46.621
<v Speaker 2>mimicking them physiologically.</v>

82
00:03:46.621 --> 00:03:51.030
<v Speaker 2>You see that everything they do is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>much farther out into chaos than </v>

83
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 2>anything they've ever done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

84
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 2>They're pushing themselves to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute limit of their ability.</v>

85
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.470
<v Speaker 2>And everyone's like this because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell with every gesture that they're </v>

86
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.891
<v Speaker 2>that close to making a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they've taken this courageous </v>

87
00:04:04.891 --> 00:04:08.941
<v Speaker 2>step beyond their competence and put </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything on the line and that </v>

88
00:04:08.941 --> 00:04:10.810
<v Speaker 2>celebrate in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when they land,</v>

89
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 2>they land in a way that's unlike </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

90
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 2>It's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus.</v>

91
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.650
<v Speaker 2>And everybody immediately leapt to their</v>
<v Speaker 2>feet and like they get a chill right and</v>

92
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 2>it's the same chill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your hair stands on end.</v>

93
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 2>It's the same cil that a mouse has when </v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks at a wolf the most puffs up.</v>

94
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:31.140
<v Speaker 2>It's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what you've just seen is all </v>

95
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.950
<v Speaker 2>inspiring because you've seen someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>courageously move past perfection into </v>

96
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 2>the unknown and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not only knowable themselves more,</v>

97
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 2>but to ennoble humanity itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And our partner your feet.</v>

98
00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:42.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

99
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 2>And then it's tens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

100
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:46.750
<v Speaker 2>It's tens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they win the gold and it's like,</v>

101
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.500
<v Speaker 2>well everyone knows what that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a great musical performance </v>

102
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.651
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been in that place where </v>

103
00:04:55.651 --> 00:04:55.651
<v Speaker 2>everything lines up better than perfect.</v>
