00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Here's an interesting thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the postmodernists claims is </v>

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.710
<v Speaker 1>that diversity is necessary and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it racial and they make it sexual.</v>

3
00:00:09.711 --> 00:00:13.970
<v Speaker 1>They may get ethnic and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually technically incorrect by</v>

4
00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:14.630
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>I study individual differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those are the differences between </v>

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.991
<v Speaker 1>people and I know the literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know about James Damore memo </v>

7
00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:30.421
<v Speaker 1>right from Google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrote that partly because he was </v>

8
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:32.611
<v Speaker 1>watching my videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why he wanted me to interview </v>

9
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:35.131
<v Speaker 1>him and I'm a believer that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>biological differences in temperament </v>

10
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:40.081
<v Speaker 1>between men and women apart from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other obvious differences and that </v>

11
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:43.621
<v Speaker 1>they're actually not trivial and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they maximizing in the societies that </v>

12
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:47.770
<v Speaker 1>have the most have moved farthest to </v>
<v Speaker 1>producing egalitarian states,</v>

13
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.470
<v Speaker 1>the Scandinavian countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>

14
00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:55.471
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that is that there's two </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why men and women different </v>

15
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:58.381
<v Speaker 1>temperament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is biological and the other is </v>

16
00:00:58.381 --> 00:01:00.781
<v Speaker 1>environmental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you remove the environmental </v>

17
00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:00.781
<v Speaker 1>variation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you do,</v>

18
00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:04.831
<v Speaker 1>if you make the state egalitarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you maximize the genetic variation and </v>

19
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 1>that's been demonstrated in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific literature over about four </v>

20
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.261
<v Speaker 1>decades and no one wanted it or hope for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and they weren't biased and looking </v>

21
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:17.821
<v Speaker 1>for it because that was exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite of what social scientists </v>

22
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:20.731
<v Speaker 1>wanted to find because social scientists</v>
<v Speaker 1>lean heavily to the left and what they </v>

23
00:01:20.731 --> 00:01:24.571
<v Speaker 1>wanted to find was you flatten out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state so that everyone has equal </v>

24
00:01:24.571 --> 00:01:26.080
<v Speaker 1>opportunity and the differences between </v>
<v Speaker 1>people disappear.</v>

25
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.230
<v Speaker 1>That is not what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opposite happened that wasn't wrong </v>

26
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.970
<v Speaker 1>and no one was happy about it and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>one's happy about it.</v>

27
00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:38.971
<v Speaker 1>Now you can actually tell when you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered something in the social </v>

28
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:39.790
<v Speaker 1>science because you're not happy about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

29
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.540
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

30
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 1>if you take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say there's a big difference </v>

31
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 1>between men and women in terms of trait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

32
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.950
<v Speaker 1>compassion and politeness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On average,</v>

33
00:01:56.951 --> 00:02:01.270
<v Speaker 1>women are more agreeable than men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference is approximately this.</v>

34
00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:04.510
<v Speaker 1>If you take random pairs of men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women out of the population,</v>

35
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.180
<v Speaker 1>let's say you had to make a bet on who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was more agreeable,</v>

36
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.540
<v Speaker 1>if you bet that it was the woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be right 60 percent of the time,</v>

37
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.200
<v Speaker 1>well that's not that much means you'd be</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

38
00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Forty percent of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's almost 50 percent of the time,</v>

39
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.680
<v Speaker 1>so this is a big difference by social </v>
<v Speaker 1>science standards,</v>

40
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.500
<v Speaker 1>but that's the magnitude of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

41
00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:25.120
<v Speaker 1>There are some differences that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>

42
00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:28.570
<v Speaker 1>like the difference between men and </v>
<v Speaker 1>women's interest in people versus things</v>

43
00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:31.030
<v Speaker 1>is actually bigger than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the biggest difference we know,</v>

44
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the agreeable this difference,</v>

45
00:02:34.151 --> 00:02:39.151
<v Speaker 1>but still they the shared attributes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women far outweigh the </v>

46
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.010
<v Speaker 1>attributes that differentiate them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you could ask are there more </v>

47
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.760
<v Speaker 1>differences within groups or between </v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

48
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Now the postmodern answered that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>between them.</v>

49
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.290
<v Speaker 1>That's why you need diversity by group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

50
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.350
<v Speaker 1>That's why you need different races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why you need different </v>

51
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.350
<v Speaker 1>ethnicities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual preferences and all of that.</v>

52
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

53
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.170
<v Speaker 1>There's more differences within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups and there is between them.</v>

54
00:03:07.171 --> 00:03:10.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't get diversity by crossing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>

55
00:03:10.381 --> 00:03:13.860
<v Speaker 1>You get diversity by group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by selecting across individuals.</v>

56
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.130
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that there is more differences </v>

57
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.771
<v Speaker 1>between groups said there is between </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals is actually the fundamental </v>

58
00:03:21.771 --> 00:03:23.970
<v Speaker 1>racist idea is the fundamental racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

59
00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:24.780
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

60
00:03:24.781 --> 00:03:29.781
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're Asian Oriental to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>the old word to discriminate the one </v>

61
00:03:31.761 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 1>type of Asian say from the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so different from me that there's</v>

62
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.690
<v Speaker 1>no overlap between our groups and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>also so different and there's so little </v>

63
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.570
<v Speaker 1>difference within your group that now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I know that you're not me,</v>

64
00:03:45.571 --> 00:03:48.000
<v Speaker 1>you're not one of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually know what you're like,</v>

65
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.170
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technically that's incorrect.</v>

66
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.810
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't how you get diversity.</v>

67
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Now diversity is actually necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people,</v>

68
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:06.741
<v Speaker 1>different intelligence and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>different temperament and the different </v>

69
00:04:06.741 --> 00:04:09.321
<v Speaker 1>skills and so you actually need </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity because otherwise you can't </v>

70
00:04:09.321 --> 00:04:12.440
<v Speaker 1>take advantage of all those differences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need diversity,</v>

71
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.680
<v Speaker 1>but you need genuine diversity and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what would genuine diversity mean?</v>

72
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.580
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying to put together a work </v>
<v Speaker 1>team,</v>

73
00:04:19.581 --> 00:04:24.581
<v Speaker 1>you want enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want people have sufficient </v>

74
00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:26.981
<v Speaker 1>diversity so that they more or less so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you gathered together the </v>

75
00:04:27.711 --> 00:04:32.711
<v Speaker 1>appropriate talents to produce the </v>
<v Speaker 1>implement that's necessary to work </v>

76
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:36.161
<v Speaker 1>properly in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a competence marker because </v>

77
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:39.230
<v Speaker 1>otherwise your business is going to fail</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the proper diversity with regards</v>

78
00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:41.150
<v Speaker 1>to employment is the diversity that</v>

79
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.750
<v Speaker 1>meets the requirements of the business </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>

80
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that's why you try to hire </v>
<v Speaker 1>people carefully and not randomly.</v>

81
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Let's say.</v>
