00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.420
<v Speaker 1>I watched this great documentary once a </v>
<v Speaker 1>called Hitman Hart and was about Bret </v>

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Hart who was the most famous Canadian in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world for awhile and he was,</v>

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.120
<v Speaker 1>he was a world wide wrestling federation</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestler,</v>

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was a good guy and he came from </v>

5
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.660
<v Speaker 1>this famous family of wrestlers who all </v>
<v Speaker 1>came from Alberta.</v>

6
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:22.050
<v Speaker 1>I think there were seven brothers who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were wrestlers and seven sisters and all</v>

7
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 1>of the sisters married wrestlers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were all offspring.</v>

8
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Children of Stu Hart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

9
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

10
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>who was a wrestling impresario like 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

11
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was such a cool documentary because I</v>

12
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>was always wondering why in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>did people watch wrestling and,</v>

13
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and believe it,</v>

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it.</v>

15
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe movies when you go watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

16
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a hard question to answer while </v>

17
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.180
<v Speaker 1>you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do.</v>

18
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're watching wrestling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a wrestling fan,</v>

19
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:51.420
<v Speaker 1>do you believe it?</v>

20
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't a matter of belief.</v>

21
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:58.011
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of being engaged in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drama and there are different levels of </v>

22
00:00:58.011 --> 00:00:58.011
<v Speaker 1>drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

23
00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:02.781
<v Speaker 1>So let's say worldwide Wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 1>Federation drama is not the most </v>

24
00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated form of drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

25
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.380
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not being not being a smart Alec</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm saying that there is drama of </v>

26
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:14.661
<v Speaker 1>different sophistication for different </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and that's also why religious </v>

27
00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>truths exists at multiple levels </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>

28
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:20.241
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be something in it for </v>

29
00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:20.241
<v Speaker 1>everyone and that's a hard belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

30
00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:24.231
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard system to put together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something for the unbelievably </v>

31
00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated and something for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>common person.</v>

32
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have wrestling and Brett Hart was </v>

33
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>a good guy and he fell into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetype of being a good guy and that's</v>

34
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>partly what the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the story's about.</v>

35
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>It was a bit too much for him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm.</v>

36
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.060
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he laid out so carefully was because he </v>

37
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.880
<v Speaker 1>figured that a hundred and $20 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people knew him,</v>

38
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>something like that and that everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>he went,</v>

39
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>he was treated like a hero.</v>

40
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>And he found that quite a bit of quite a</v>
<v Speaker 1>burden.</v>

41
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>And as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it,</v>

42
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.650
<v Speaker 1>but he portrayed what was happening in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrestling ring as classic good </v>

43
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.180
<v Speaker 1>against evil but not conceptualized in </v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust,</v>

44
00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Embodied,</v>

45
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.090
<v Speaker 1>fought out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acted out,</v>

46
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

47
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like thor and the hulk,</v>

48
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>except like right in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

49
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>well that's exactly this sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

50
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could consider hockey more </v>

51
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated than wrestling perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that has,</v>

52
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.170
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not being a critic of these.</v>

53
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I am not being critically minded about </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

54
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I understand their purpose and I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly recommend that documentary.</v>

55
00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:24.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a brilliant documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is,</v>

56
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.640
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a Silver Cup,</v>

57
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:31.641
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's the hero of the team </v>

58
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:31.880
<v Speaker 1>that's the hero of the teams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

59
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>here's something cool if you're.</v>

60
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.240
<v Speaker 1>The founder of the Toronto Blue Jays are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Toronto Maple leafs.</v>

61
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Of course this hardly ever happens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you if you're a fan of the Toronto Maple</v>

62
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>leafs because they always lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

63
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.550
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're watching a game and your </v>

64
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.780
<v Speaker 1>team wins and we take your testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels,</v>

65
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.810
<v Speaker 1>then they went up and if you watched the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toronto Maple leafs and they lost and </v>

66
00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>you're a fan than your testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels go.</v>

67
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty damn funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean really don't you see how deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantiated this as in people?</v>

69
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it bloody well alters your biochemistry,</v>

70
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:09.200
<v Speaker 1>like your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

71
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.300
<v Speaker 1>your testosterone levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all my team lost,</v>

72
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there'll be no,</v>

73
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>there'll be nothing in it for the wife </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight,</v>

74
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

75
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
