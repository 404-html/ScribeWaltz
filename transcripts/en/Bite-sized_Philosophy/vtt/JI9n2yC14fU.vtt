1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the rats and this is from Yak </v>

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Panksepp's work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.730
<v Speaker 1>He was the first guy who figured out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest giggle and you might think,</v>

4
00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:13.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of stupid thing is that to </v>

5
00:00:13.731 --> 00:00:13.731
<v Speaker 1>study?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like $50,000</v>

6
00:00:13.731 --> 00:00:13.731
<v Speaker 1>research grant for giggling rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:13.731 --> 00:00:17.890
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he discovered the place circuitry in</v>

8
00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal,</v>

9
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:25.041
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like discovering a whole new </v>

10
00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:25.041
<v Speaker 1>continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a place circuit in mammals.</v>

11
00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>It's built right in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not socially constructed.</v>

12
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a biological platform for that.</v>

13
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>And so what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

14
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>What panksepp would do with rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he found out if rats,</v>

15
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.420
<v Speaker 1>if you take a rat pup away from its </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>

16
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>it dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you feed it,</v>

17
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 1>even if it keep it warm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it dies.</v>

18
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Now you can stop it from dying by taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pencil with an eraser on the end and </v>

19
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 1>massaging it right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because rats won't live without love.</v>

20
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>And the same thing happens to human </v>
<v Speaker 1>babies.</v>

21
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:55.281
<v Speaker 1>And we saw that in Romania when there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that catastrophe have to Chesko in </v>

22
00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:59.211
<v Speaker 1>the orphanages were the orphanages were </v>
<v Speaker 1>full of unwanted babies because Joe </v>

23
00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Chesko insisted that every Romanian </v>
<v Speaker 1>women was constantly pregnant.</v>

24
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.900
<v Speaker 1>So the orphanage just stacked up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>unwanted babies and lots of them didn't </v>

25
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>even have names and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>warehoused.</v>

26
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Warmth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shelter,</v>

27
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>devastating.</v>

28
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Lots of them died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them died before the first year.</v>

29
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.590
<v Speaker 1>And the ones that didn't die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're permanently dysfunctional because </v>

30
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>you have to be touched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a human being,</v>

31
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>it's not an option you have to be played</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

32
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not an option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

33
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.030
<v Speaker 1>it's part of neurodevelopmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity.</v>

34
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to also play fair,</v>

35
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.700
<v Speaker 1>so because otherwise you produce a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>disjointed child who isn't able to </v>

36
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>engage in the niceties of social </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction,</v>

37
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>which is continual play in some sense in</v>
<v Speaker 1>reciprocity.</v>

38
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.440
<v Speaker 1>So what Panksepp did with his wrath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he noticed the male rats,</v>

39
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 1>juveniles really liked to wrestle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they wrestle just like humans beings </v>

40
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.151
<v Speaker 1>wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pin each other for crying out loud </v>

41
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:53.151
<v Speaker 1>with like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have just lost.</v>

42
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>He's down for a 10 count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

43
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.790
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you do is you take juvenile </v>

44
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.281
<v Speaker 1>routes and you can find out that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to play because you can attach a </v>

45
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.360
<v Speaker 1>spring to the and then they'll try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>run and you can measure how hard they're</v>

46
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.370
<v Speaker 1>running by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how hard they're pulling on the spring </v>

47
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.370
<v Speaker 1>and then you can estimate how motivated </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>

48
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.750
<v Speaker 1>And so you can find out that a nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well fed rat who doesn't have anything </v>

49
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>on his mind will still work hard to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it,</v>

50
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>to enter a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an arena where he's been allowed to play</v>

51
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll work for that.</v>

52
00:02:21.781 --> 00:02:26.781
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the rats motivated so the two rats </v>

53
00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:27.500
<v Speaker 1>go out there and they play and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they're,</v>

54
00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:30.700
<v Speaker 1>they're playing like dogs play and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone knows what that looks like.</v>

55
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.670
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.680
<v Speaker 1>if you have any sense about dogs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of go like this and kids do that </v>

57
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.731
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you do that with your wife if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to play with her a little </v>

58
00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:41.670
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My poor wife man,</v>

59
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.360
<v Speaker 1>when she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

60
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:46.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was uh,</v>

61
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a young.</v>

62
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 1>She had older siblings and so she wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>played with as much when she was little,</v>

63
00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:52.420
<v Speaker 1>as she might've been in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

64
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.660
<v Speaker 1>I used to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>if you take a pillow and you go like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this three times,</v>

66
00:02:57.241 --> 00:03:02.241
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means look out a pillow is coming </v>

67
00:03:02.241 --> 00:03:02.241
<v Speaker 1>your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I go one,</v>

68
00:03:02.241 --> 00:03:02.241
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>

69
00:03:02.241 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When she looked,</v>

70
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:05.800
<v Speaker 1>she was completely dismayed and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

71
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>what do you do that for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

72
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eventually tartar that rule.</v>

73
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.010
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing I used to do,</v>

74
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:23.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is sometimes she'd come out and be like </v>

75
00:03:23.641 --> 00:03:26.071
<v Speaker 1>this when we were playing around and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbed her wrist and I know Parker her </v>

76
00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:30.960
<v Speaker 1>hands through her knuckles together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she used to just get completely annoyed </v>

77
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.460
<v Speaker 1>about that and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

78
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.060
<v Speaker 1>that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just open your hands.</v>

79
00:03:36.061 --> 00:03:41.061
<v Speaker 1>While she didn't know that either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she hadn't been played with enough </v>

80
00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:41.061
<v Speaker 1>when she was a little rat.</v>

81
00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:41.760
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

82
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

83
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.140
<v Speaker 1>so you let the route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little rats go out there.</v>

84
00:03:48.141 --> 00:03:53.141
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so let's imagine one of them is 10 </v>

85
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:54.971
<v Speaker 1>percent bigger than the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that 10 percent bigger wins </v>

86
00:03:54.971 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 1>because 10 percent is enough in rat wait</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ensure that you're going to be the </v>

87
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.590
<v Speaker 1>pinner rather than the penny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

88
00:04:00.591 --> 00:04:02.000
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's fine.</v>

89
00:04:02.001 --> 00:04:05.840
<v Speaker 1>So when the rat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rat pins the pins a little route and</v>

90
00:04:05.841 --> 00:04:08.690
<v Speaker 1>now the big rat is the is the authority </v>
<v Speaker 1>rat.</v>

91
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.200
<v Speaker 1>And so then the next time that the rats </v>
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>

92
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.630
<v Speaker 1>the little rat has to invite the big rat</v>
<v Speaker 1>to play.</v>

93
00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:17.930
<v Speaker 1>So the big rats out there being cool and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little rat pops up and you know,</v>

94
00:04:17.931 --> 00:04:19.730
<v Speaker 1>does the whole will you play with me </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

95
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.860
<v Speaker 1>And the big rat will deign to play with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

96
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 1>But if you pair them repeatedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless the big rat lets the little rat </v>

97
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.761
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 percent of the time the little rat </v>

98
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:30.761
<v Speaker 1>will not invite him to play.</v>

99
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:31.640
<v Speaker 1>And panksepp discovered that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

100
00:04:31.641 --> 00:04:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I read that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That just blew me away.</v>

101
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is so amazing because you see walls</v>

102
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 1>first of there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an analogy to Piaget's ideas </v>

103
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.740
<v Speaker 1>about the emergence of morality out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>play in human beings.</v>

104
00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:47.741
<v Speaker 1>So that was very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the notion that that was built into </v>

105
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:49.010
<v Speaker 1>rats at the level of wrestling was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're social,</v>

106
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.480
<v Speaker 1>they're deeply social animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

107
00:04:50.481 --> 00:04:55.481
<v Speaker 1>They have to know how to get along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>one another and most of their authority </v>

108
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:55.610
<v Speaker 1>disputes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance,</v>

109
00:04:55.611 --> 00:05:00.611
<v Speaker 1>dispute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want them to end in bloodshed </v>

110
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:02.210
<v Speaker 1>and combat because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your rag one and two and we tear each</v>

111
00:05:02.211 --> 00:05:07.211
<v Speaker 1>other just threat shreds and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance dispute rack three is just </v>

112
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:08.600
<v Speaker 1>going to move in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really not a great strategy.</v>

113
00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:11.450
<v Speaker 1>And so it'd be better if we could settle</v>
<v Speaker 1>our differences,</v>

114
00:05:11.451 --> 00:05:14.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat peacefully and so while.</v>

115
00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.860
<v Speaker 1>So rats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

116
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.790
<v Speaker 1>panksepp figured out that rats plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only do they play,</v>

117
00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:21.470
<v Speaker 1>they play fair and they seem to enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

118
00:05:21.471 --> 00:05:23.600
<v Speaker 1>He also figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was really cool too,</v>

119
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.340
<v Speaker 1>that if you give juvenile rats attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>deficit disorder drugs,</v>

120
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Ritalin suppresses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pray,</v>

121
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.610
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's worth thinking about.</v>

122
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

123
00:05:35.031 --> 00:05:40.031
<v Speaker 1>why do you have to give juvenile human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings amphetamines in school?</v>

124
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they need to play.</v>

125
00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Well you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to play.</v>

126
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.210
<v Speaker 1>They don't get to wrestle around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

127
00:05:47.211 --> 00:05:50.600
<v Speaker 1>that's oppression as far as I can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't get to wrestle around.</v>

128
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.790
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feed him some amphetamines,</v>

129
00:05:52.791 --> 00:05:57.791
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'll shut down the old place </v>

130
00:05:57.791 --> 00:05:57.791
<v Speaker 1>circuits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

131
00:05:57.791 --> 00:06:00.221
<v Speaker 1>here's the other problem is Panksepp </v>
<v Speaker 1>found that if you don't let juvenile </v>

132
00:06:00.221 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 1>male rats play their prefrontal cortexes</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't develop properly.</v>

133
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise.</v>

134
00:06:05.091 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>You're not letting them mature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

135
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 1>what else would you expect?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

136
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something to think about really </v>

137
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
