00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.930
<v Speaker 1>The postmodernists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the,</v>

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.020
<v Speaker 1>they're the logical conclusion of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nietzschean dilemma.</v>

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>God is dead value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The value structure collapsed.</v>

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>The specter of rises of all value </v>
<v Speaker 1>structures collapsing.</v>

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.420
<v Speaker 1>That's the postmodernist dogma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All value structures have collapsed.</v>

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.600
<v Speaker 1>They're only there for the purposes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>exclusion.</v>

7
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>They have no intrinsic value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

8
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.720
<v Speaker 1>very powerful argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it dominates the </v>

9
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.501
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That and the fact that allows people to </v>

10
00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>dispense with their moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>

11
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>which is something that's never </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed by the postmodernist,</v>

12
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.650
<v Speaker 1>but you have to give the devil his due.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the problem with postmodernism?</v>

13
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if all value structures have collapsed,</v>

14
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.200
<v Speaker 1>then there's nothing to do because in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to do something,</v>

15
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>one thing has to be better than another </v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise why do it?</v>

16
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.940
<v Speaker 1>And so people who are ensconced in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodern tradition are undermined by </v>

17
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.591
<v Speaker 1>their own philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can deconstruct their own </v>

18
00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:13.461
<v Speaker 1>deconstruction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case they might as well just </v>

19
00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:16.161
<v Speaker 1>sit there and do nothing which would </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually be preferable to what they're </v>

20
00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:16.161
<v Speaker 1>doing now.</v>

21
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.170
<v Speaker 1>So how do they extract themselves from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that dilemma?</v>

22
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.520
<v Speaker 1>They do any illogically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't care because the </v>

23
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>postmodernists first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't believe in logic.</v>

24
00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 1>That's a reflection of the logos which </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've dispensed with dialogue.</v>

25
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:39.321
<v Speaker 1>They don't believe that because that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflection of the logos which they've </v>

26
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>dispensed with logic and dialogue are </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant.</v>

27
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does bring up the problem of what </v>

28
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.190
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

29
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.311
<v Speaker 1>the postmodernist finesse that by </v>
<v Speaker 1>reverting to the Marxist doctrines from </v>

30
00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>which postmodernism emerged and so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

31
00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

32
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 1>you can't get any direction from </v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism,</v>

33
00:01:55.231 --> 00:02:00.231
<v Speaker 1>but we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to worry about that </v>

34
00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:00.231
<v Speaker 1>because we don't worry about such </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

35
00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:04.220
<v Speaker 1>What we'll do is just use slight of hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>to push forward the communitarian </v>

36
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>doctrines out of which our original </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis emerged and everyone says,</v>

37
00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:14.301
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll turn a blind eye to the paradox </v>

38
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:14.301
<v Speaker 1>because we actually need something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

39
00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:16.560
<v Speaker 1>and plus to the degree that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>communitarian,</v>

40
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.710
<v Speaker 1>we can take out our nihilistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment and arrogance and in </v>

41
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.941
<v Speaker 1>gratitude on every single person we </v>
<v Speaker 1>deemed to have something more than we </v>

42
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:25.941
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

43
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're wondering why certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>values can exist in the absence of any </v>

44
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:37.761
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to look no farther than to </v>

45
00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:41.031
<v Speaker 1>understand that people who are desperate</v>
<v Speaker 1>and chaotic will still be angry and </v>

46
00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:45.771
<v Speaker 1>destructive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can manifest that perfectly </v>

47
00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:46.190
<v Speaker 1>with the moral mask that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

48
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really after what you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have a little more than me.</v>

49
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking on behalf of these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who have even less.</v>

50
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's absolute nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny watching Yale students </v>

51
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.050
<v Speaker 1>complain about the privileged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in the top one 10th of 100 of a </v>

52
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>percent of people who've lived in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire history of the planet,</v>

53
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>much less just the people that are on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet.</v>

54
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Now they're dominating patriarchs in </v>
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>

55
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby representatives of the patriarchy,</v>

56
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>and all they do is complain about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny,</v>

57
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.070
<v Speaker 1>tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinitesimal fraction of people who </v>

58
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>have slightly more than they have now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's appalling.</v>

59
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.330
<v Speaker 1>And their idiot professors pat them on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the back and send them out the world to </v>

60
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of teaching them how to live,</v>

61
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>they damaged their mental health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

62
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they heard our society.</v>

63
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 1>They're bringing things down and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're aiming at.</v>

64
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.320
<v Speaker 1>The postmodernist managed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>nihilistic and totalitarian at the same </v>

65
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:56.020
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something that not even need to</v>

66
00:03:56.021 --> 00:04:01.021
<v Speaker 1>dreamed about despite the fact that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had the greatest imagination for </v>

67
00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:03.790
<v Speaker 1>pathology that perhaps ever existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>

68
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:08.791
<v Speaker 1>they combine the nihilism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>totalitarianism with the worst aspects </v>

69
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:14.041
<v Speaker 1>of dogmatic religion because what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've essentially established is a </v>

70
00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:18.091
<v Speaker 1>cult into which children who attend </v>
<v Speaker 1>university are now indoctrinated at </v>

71
00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 1>great cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might add,</v>

72
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 1>and with very little practical outcome.</v>
