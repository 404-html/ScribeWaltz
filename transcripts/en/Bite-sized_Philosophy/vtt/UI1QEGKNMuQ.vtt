00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Eighty percent of humanities papers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not sighted once</v>

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.960
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

4
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.750
<v Speaker 3>So let's just translate that for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>viewing public.</v>

5
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.810
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means that they're producing </v>

6
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.980
<v Speaker 3>scholarship that nobody looks at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that even their friends don't</v>

7
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.680
<v Speaker 1>look out because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:22.681
<v Speaker 1>So what a citation is is I read </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's paper and I find a good idea </v>

9
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:25.951
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I used that idea to buttress </v>

10
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:25.951
<v Speaker 1>and idea of my own or to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to,</v>

11
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 1>or to riff off or to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to,</v>

12
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.790
<v Speaker 1>or to criticize even for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I cite them,</v>

13
00:00:30.791 --> 00:00:32.530
<v Speaker 1>I say who they were and when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>published it.</v>

14
00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:33.740
<v Speaker 1>And then the paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

15
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.260
<v Speaker 1>that there's a huge bureaucracy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps track of citations.</v>

16
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.870
<v Speaker 3>It's a major indication of academic </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability to be cited,</v>

17
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.320
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

18
00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

19
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.950
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's academic payment to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>cited.</v>

20
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.190
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So 80 percent of humanities papers don't</v>

21
00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:53.191
<v Speaker 3>get cited once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's absolute failure is absolute </v>

22
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:55.540
<v Speaker 3>failure as a game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone wanted to play a game,</v>

23
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would suggest that they go and they </v>

24
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.031
<v Speaker 3>look at the publications of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>professors in a particular area and see </v>

25
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:08.401
<v Speaker 3>if the titles all sound the same and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they all say something about </v>

26
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.560
<v Speaker 3>intersectionality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a colonialism and,</v>

27
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:18.561
<v Speaker 3>and these other various social justice </v>
<v Speaker 3>words you might wonder,</v>

28
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.420
<v Speaker 3>am I going to get taught the same course</v>
<v Speaker 3>again and again by every professor in </v>

29
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.550
<v Speaker 3>this program because it seems to me that</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of their research is very similar.</v>

30
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.970
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

31
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.030
<v Speaker 3>and how can that be when there's such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>broad base of knowledge and the world </v>

32
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.380
<v Speaker 3>that we can have such similarity between</v>
<v Speaker 3>every publication,</v>

33
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 3>which then goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

34
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:43.720
<v Speaker 3>Why do I need to read my colleague stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's exactly like my own,</v>

35
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.030
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we see.</v>

36
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.490
<v Speaker 3>So just just as a baseline Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>

37
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:49.610
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

38
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.620
<v Speaker 3>what would you say is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is someone who's doing some good </v>

39
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.620
<v Speaker 3>research?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>

40
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.870
<v Speaker 3>how many citations would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would they be receiving?</v>

41
00:01:55.871 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a collectively like what are we </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at?</v>

42
00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.890
<v Speaker 3>Thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thousands?</v>

43
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

44
00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:01.660
<v Speaker 3>a good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you,</v>

45
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.300
<v Speaker 1>if you write a good paper</v>

46
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.450
<v Speaker 1>then like a great paypal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paypal will get you 100 citations,</v>

47
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:14.451
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>An outstanding overwhelmingly </v>

48
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>outstanding paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get you a thousand citations.</v>

49
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 isn't none,</v>

50
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you register with 10,</v>

51
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 1>but zero is failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.250
<v Speaker 1>It means your work had zero impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means your work wasn't worth the </v>

53
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.020
<v Speaker 1>paper it was published on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

54
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.050
<v Speaker 1>this brings us to a kind of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>little issue with regards to the rot in </v>

55
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>the universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

56
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>which Deborah mccloud she says does not </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist.</v>

57
00:02:36.871 --> 00:02:41.871
<v Speaker 1>It's like here's how the game works is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we set up a little ideological </v>

58
00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>garden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

59
00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:47.541
<v Speaker 1>The 10 of us play in and then we all </v>
<v Speaker 1>publish in the same journal and we peer </v>

60
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:49.620
<v Speaker 1>review each other's articles and we just</v>
<v Speaker 1>publish them.</v>

61
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.420
<v Speaker 1>There's no critique or very little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

62
00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>the barrier for publication is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very low when it should be very high,</v>

63
00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>like a good journal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good journal reject.</v>

64
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Ninety percent of the papers that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:02.330
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

66
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.360
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

67
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>are submitted to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

68
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.440
<v Speaker 1>So I'm rejection rates really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is why do the these </v>

69
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.150
<v Speaker 1>papers get published since no one reads </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and they have nothing to offer and </v>

70
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very straightforward.</v>

71
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.660
<v Speaker 1>The journals are extremely expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are way more expensive than they should </v>

72
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just to buy a single paper online for</v>

73
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:31.081
<v Speaker 1>the ordinary person is like $40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more than a hardcover book </v>

74
00:03:31.081 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 1>that's just to download the PDF.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the journal itself,</v>

75
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 1>the libraries are full of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very expensive and the subscriptions</v>

76
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:40.861
<v Speaker 1>are very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens is the professors </v>

77
00:03:40.861 --> 00:03:44.190
<v Speaker 1>pressure the university libraries to by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the journals and the library funds the </v>

78
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 1>publisher and so the publishers will </v>
<v Speaker 1>publish anything.</v>

79
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:52.111
<v Speaker 1>Routledge is a good example of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much to my chagrin because they </v>

80
00:03:52.111 --> 00:03:55.171
<v Speaker 1>published my first book but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they used to be a great publishing </v>

81
00:03:55.171 --> 00:03:55.171
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll publish damn near anything.</v>

82
00:03:55.171 --> 00:03:59.731
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>libraries are forced to pay radically </v>

83
00:03:59.731 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>inflated prices for the publications </v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one ever reads.</v>

84
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.160
<v Speaker 1>And so people right to publish in </v>
<v Speaker 1>journals that libraries have to purchase</v>

85
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 1>at inflated prices to produce knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one will ever read.</v>

86
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's the little scandal that </v>
<v Speaker 1>plagues the humanities.</v>

87
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:18.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it characterizes the humanities </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than plagues them.</v>
