1
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.260
<v Speaker 1>So this week we've had the google thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was the youtube thing that </v>

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.140
<v Speaker 1>happened last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on with censorship and what</v>

3
00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:12.070
<v Speaker 1>should people do about it?</v>

4
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.460
<v Speaker 2>If you're in a workplace in </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathological,</v>

5
00:00:15.461 --> 00:00:17.350
<v Speaker 2>things are happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is easy.</v>

6
00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:22.351
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you how you know of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathological things are happening at </v>

7
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:23.920
<v Speaker 2>your workplace or they're happening with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you one of the two.</v>

8
00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:28.921
<v Speaker 2>But you can straighten that out if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're being required to do things that </v>

9
00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:32.890
<v Speaker 2>make you weak and ashamed,</v>

10
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.060
<v Speaker 3>then stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't do them.</v>

11
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.280
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the things I learned from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Solzhenitsyn and Frankl was that</v>

12
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.110
<v Speaker 2>systems go terribly under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of control when people don't stop </v>

13
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.461
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they're going mildly out of </v>

14
00:00:55.461 --> 00:00:55.461
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

15
00:00:55.461 --> 00:00:58.941
<v Speaker 2>when you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should just keep my goddamn head down </v>

16
00:00:58.941 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 2>and shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like maybe you should like,</v>

17
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 2>that's not bad advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

18
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.680
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to make unnecessary </v>
<v Speaker 2>enemies and you don't need any more </v>

19
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.621
<v Speaker 2>trouble than you need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got to ask yourself on a day to </v>

20
00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 2>day basis what makes you think you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not selling your soul?</v>

21
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's so much foolishness going on</v>

22
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 2>in the mid level bureaucratic world now </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where all the tyranny seems to be</v>

23
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:24.681
<v Speaker 2>focused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason that it multiplies is </v>

24
00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 2>because sensible people say nothing</v>

25
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.790
<v Speaker 2>when they should say something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's so strange about that is that</v>

26
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.750
<v Speaker 2>there are way more sensible people than </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who aren't sensible.</v>

27
00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 2>They're just not as noisy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you'll turn out if like,</v>

28
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.920
<v Speaker 2>so let's say something's bugging the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hell out of you at work,</v>

29
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 2>well then you have to prepare it to find</v>
<v Speaker 2>another job.</v>

30
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing you have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that you should find </v>

31
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.431
<v Speaker 2>another job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you should prepare to find another </v>

32
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:53.431
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if possible,</v>

33
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:58.201
<v Speaker 2>you should prepare to find a better job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you can't tell someone to go </v>

34
00:01:58.201 --> 00:01:59.170
<v Speaker 2>to hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can't negotiate with them.</v>

35
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.810
<v Speaker 2>And if and if they've got you over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>barrel,</v>

36
00:02:01.811 --> 00:02:03.970
<v Speaker 2>then you can't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you gotTa,</v>

37
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.790
<v Speaker 2>you gotta set yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've got some mobility and actually</v>

38
00:02:06.791 --> 00:02:08.410
<v Speaker 2>that's a really good principal in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

39
00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:08.890
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

40
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.700
<v Speaker 2>You should set yourself up so that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a lateral move at hand.</v>

41
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.220
<v Speaker 2>And then you should find out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

42
00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:18.370
<v Speaker 2>are there things at work that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>disturbing my soul?</v>

43
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you find that out.</v>

44
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.460
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ask yourself,</v>

45
00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:22.510
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm disturbed at work.</v>

46
00:02:22.511 --> 00:02:27.511
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably week and deceitful and </v>

47
00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:27.820
<v Speaker 2>useless and lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might as well start with that.</v>

48
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.030
<v Speaker 2>And then you talk to some people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>your wife,</v>

49
00:02:31.031 --> 00:02:32.560
<v Speaker 2>your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your coworkers,</v>

50
00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:35.680
<v Speaker 2>and find out are you stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deceitful and lazy,</v>

51
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.200
<v Speaker 2>or is there something not so good going </v>
<v Speaker 2>on at work?</v>

52
00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:43.201
<v Speaker 2>And so if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can then eliminate your own </v>

53
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:43.960
<v Speaker 2>personal pathology as a cause of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissatisfaction,</v>

54
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 2>then maybe there's something rotten in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the state of Denmark and maybe you </v>

55
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.760
<v Speaker 2>should say something about it before the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole goddamn thing collapses.</v>

56
00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:56.761
<v Speaker 2>Because that can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can happen in companies a lot faster </v>

57
00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:56.761
<v Speaker 2>than people ever think.</v>

58
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.210
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you may find that,</v>

59
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all may find if you say </v>

60
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.300
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well first of all,</v>

61
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.300
<v Speaker 2>that's an adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure.</v>

62
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.750
<v Speaker 2>That's a bloody adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to do it carefully and,</v>

63
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 2>and you have to be prepared for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it might be the best thing that ever</v>

64
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 2>happened to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing is if you're careful</v>

65
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get your words right.</v>

66
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 2>Like in this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is strategic battle,</v>

67
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:21.181
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not something you wander into </v>

68
00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:22.531
<v Speaker 2>carelessly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you may find that there's lots of </v>

69
00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:25.291
<v Speaker 2>people who feel exactly the same way you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do and that you've actually caught and </v>

70
00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:28.611
<v Speaker 2>onto something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a canary in a coal mine and not </v>

71
00:03:28.611 --> 00:03:31.321
<v Speaker 2>just some like psychopathic mouthpiece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you got to ask yourself,</v>

72
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 2>when you go and do what you do like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this making you stronger?</v>

73
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 2>Is this making you weaker?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it's making you weaker,</v>

74
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 2>then you got to ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you really want to be weaker?</v>

75
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.030
<v Speaker 2>Because the weaker you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more your tyrannized.</v>

76
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 2>And then worse than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the weaker you get,</v>

77
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:50.431
<v Speaker 2>the more bitter you get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the more you'll work towards </v>

78
00:03:50.431 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 2>terrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you'll snap it your wife,</v>

79
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 2>the more you'll kick your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

80
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 2>like it's no joke to be tyrannized at </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

81
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.840
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say you have an ethical </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility as a citizen to </v>

82
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 2>forthrightly confront,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creeping tyranny,</v>

83
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 2>no matter where it occurs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of,</v>

84
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 2>part of what we're learning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say from these stories,</v>

85
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:15.850
<v Speaker 2>if we're learning anything at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if you're aimed at the good,</v>

86
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.580
<v Speaker 2>which is a question you really got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask yourself,</v>

87
00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're genuinely aimed at the good,</v>

88
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 2>then take heart because you're a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger than you think.</v>

89
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

90
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.890
<v Speaker 1>I have a followup question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

91
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.250
<v Speaker 1>So I'm speaking to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of people who were in this </v>

92
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.250
<v Speaker 1>situation like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.420
<v Speaker 1>people at universities and corporations </v>
<v Speaker 1>all over the place.</v>

94
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Google is not the only company that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the worst repressive,</v>

96
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech,</v>

97
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 1>denying workplace codes and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>feels alone,</v>

98
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:52.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all like,</v>

99
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.610
<v Speaker 1>why should I stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a martyr,</v>

100
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.830
<v Speaker 1>get fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy at Google got fired.</v>

101
00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the point?</v>

102
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.740
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking rhetorically.</v>

103
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question.</v>

104
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 1>And how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you convince people that there's </v>

105
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.680
<v Speaker 1>a point to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to standing up when it appears to be </v>

106
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.680
<v Speaker 1>futile?</v>

107
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.060
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

108
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing I think is you convince </v>

109
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.800
<v Speaker 2>them that it's not few tiles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be difficult,</v>

110
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.780
<v Speaker 2>but it's not futile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get your words right,</v>

111
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.440
<v Speaker 2>you have something to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll be an impact of those words.</v>

112
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.840
<v Speaker 2>It might not be the impact that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would choose,</v>

113
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.050
<v Speaker 2>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the other thing you got to tell </v>

114
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.870
<v Speaker 2>people is pick your poison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

115
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 2>You may be in a situation where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have a.</v>

116
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.410
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a cake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walk to the garden of Paradise.</v>

117
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.710
<v Speaker 2>You got tyranny or famine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are your choices,</v>

118
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.210
<v Speaker 2>but you get to pick which one you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say if,</v>

119
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.660
<v Speaker 2>if you're being oppressed and I mean in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your soul by what you're required to </v>

120
00:05:56.281 --> 00:06:00.020
<v Speaker 2>swallow at work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you think you're not paying a price</v>

121
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got no self respect and,</v>

122
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:03.870
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

123
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.360
<v Speaker 2>and rightly so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but worse than that,</v>

124
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 2>you're an agent of your own destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're destroying your own ideal and </v>

125
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.870
<v Speaker 2>you're letting people who are weak and </v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt when</v>

126
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.090
<v Speaker 2>and if you stood up and stood up </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>

127
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 2>but you have to put yourself in order to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>

128
00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:23.210
<v Speaker 2>At least to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

129
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:28.211
<v Speaker 2>You can't do it casually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to do it from some position of </v>

130
00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:32.380
<v Speaker 2>preparedness and strength.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what makes you think you couldn't </v>

131
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.000
<v Speaker 2>scare them back into the corners and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be a good thing and you know </v>

132
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.760
<v Speaker 2>the alternative personally is bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's a psychological </v>

133
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 2>degeneration that goes along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this with many,</v>

134
00:06:44.151 --> 00:06:49.151
<v Speaker 2>many of the people that I've worked with</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have been tyrannized in the </v>

135
00:06:49.151 --> 00:06:51.950
<v Speaker 2>workplace to the absolute detriment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their psychological and physical health.</v>

136
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.960
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To the point of collapse confronting </v>

137
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.730
<v Speaker 2>these crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy things when they were sensible </v>

138
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:01.880
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a terrible price to pay man.</v>

139
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bad price.</v>

140
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.190
<v Speaker 2>And then if the foolishness isn't dealt </v>
<v Speaker 2>with at the local level when it's still </v>

141
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:16.301
<v Speaker 2>relatively trivial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it will multiply until it's dealt </v>

142
00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:19.661
<v Speaker 2>with at the social level and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing signs of that already on two fa </v>

143
00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:20.650
<v Speaker 2>is a good sign of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

144
00:07:20.651 --> 00:07:25.651
<v Speaker 2>and problems that aren't solved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Multiply and soon people fight and you </v>

145
00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>edit,</v>

146
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:28.070
<v Speaker 2>argue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then to fight.</v>

147
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:34.040
<v Speaker 2>Unless you want to fight and some people</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to fight and I can understand why,</v>

148
00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:35.540
<v Speaker 2>but I wouldn't recommend it because</v>

149
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.960
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't lead good places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really doesn't lead good places,</v>

150
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.770
<v Speaker 2>so I would say you have a duty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's,</v>

151
00:07:46.771 --> 00:07:49.460
<v Speaker 2>that's where you stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because you have a god damn duty to</v>

152
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:54.461
<v Speaker 2>stand up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just say what you have to say it.</v>

153
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.810
<v Speaker 2>You don't even have to be trying to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>a point.</v>

154
00:07:56.811 --> 00:07:58.370
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to get something done.</v>

155
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:00.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how it looks to me.</v>

156
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:02.840
<v Speaker 2>That's what that guy had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google did.</v>

157
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.630
<v Speaker 2>He wrote this memo and he said he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to him today.</v>

158
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:06.170
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

159
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 2>he went to a diversity training seminar </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he thought,</v>

160
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.290
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with that.</v>

161
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.700
<v Speaker 2>And so then they asked for feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we wrote this document a month ago.</v>

162
00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:19.940
<v Speaker 2>This was written a month ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got No real response to it.</v>

163
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it bounced around inside Google until a </v>

164
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.660
<v Speaker 2>lot of people got interested in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It escaped into the outside world,</v>

165
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:32.410
<v Speaker 2>but all he was doing was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was told a bunch of things he didn't </v>

166
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:36.821
<v Speaker 2>think were true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote down a bunch of things he </v>

167
00:08:36.821 --> 00:08:37.250
<v Speaker 2>thought were probably true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He launched that out and said,</v>

168
00:08:37.251 --> 00:08:39.710
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think these things are probably true.</v>

169
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:40.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

170
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:45.680
<v Speaker 2>probably their true well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he paid a price for it,</v>

171
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 2>but maybe we'll see what sort of price </v>
<v Speaker 2>he paid for it,</v>

172
00:08:47.721 --> 00:08:52.721
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a lot tougher in two </v>

173
00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:52.721
<v Speaker 2>years than he was two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

174
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

175
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.830
<v Speaker 2>they didn't answer his feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

176
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

177
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can watch the video,</v>

178
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 2>the stories there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's kind of the outline of it.</v>

179
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry to monopolize this.</v>

180
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.000
<v Speaker 1>I have one other question about this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important,</v>

181
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:13.990
<v Speaker 1>aside from Google just being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>workplace,</v>

182
00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.480
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also controls the on Youtube,</v>

183
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:17.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>

184
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.970
<v Speaker 1>which is post a new censorship scheme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

185
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:27.910
<v Speaker 1>and it controls a huge amount of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information that people get.</v>

186
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:33.130
<v Speaker 1>And so true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens to society when </v>

187
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:39.150
<v Speaker 1>companies such as Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which control our information start to </v>

188
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 1>censor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just how about ourselves and maybe </v>

189
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.200
<v Speaker 1>the information that's coming out to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the world.</v>

190
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.250
<v Speaker 1>How much is this already happening and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how much?</v>

191
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.440
<v Speaker 2>How about if we would have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we refuse to find out,</v>

192
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.850
<v Speaker 2>that would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

193
00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:56.000
<v Speaker 2>like I reviewed this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's document,</v>

194
00:09:56.001 --> 00:10:01.001
<v Speaker 2>I did that yesterday and everything he </v>
<v Speaker 2>said was validated by the scientific </v>

195
00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:04.760
<v Speaker 2>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what has happened is that someone has</v>

196
00:10:04.761 --> 00:10:09.761
<v Speaker 2>been fired publicly by a major </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporation for stating well grounded </v>

197
00:10:09.761 --> 00:10:14.710
<v Speaker 2>scientific truths right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly the sorts of things that I say </v>

198
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:19.271
<v Speaker 2>in my classes for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason that I say to them is </v>

199
00:10:19.271 --> 00:10:21.731
<v Speaker 2>because I read the literature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not because I'm personally happy </v>

200
00:10:21.731 --> 00:10:25.121
<v Speaker 2>about the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Iq research particularly is so </v>

201
00:10:25.121 --> 00:10:28.220
<v Speaker 2>dismal that you can't possibly read it </v>
<v Speaker 2>without being seriously disheartened.</v>

202
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.190
<v Speaker 2>If I could reconstruct the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that ICU,</v>

203
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:34.730
<v Speaker 2>the ICU research wasn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

204
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.980
<v Speaker 2>it should be tempting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

205
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.470
<v Speaker 2>but that's not how science works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Science doesn't tell you what you,</v>

206
00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.450
<v Speaker 2>what you want to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just tells you the way it bloody well</v>

207
00:10:44.451 --> 00:10:47.900
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he got pilloried for.</v>

208
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.990
<v Speaker 2>He got pilloried for revealing a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>fraction of current scientific knowledge</v>

209
00:10:55.431 --> 00:10:57.290
<v Speaker 2>about gender differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

210
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.100
<v Speaker 2>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you said,</v>

211
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:03.470
<v Speaker 2>that's a big company and it controls our</v>
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>

212
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.680
<v Speaker 2>It's how about we do what we can to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ensure that these large communication </v>

213
00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:15.671
<v Speaker 2>companies don't get to impose a </v>
<v Speaker 2>factually false ideological structure on</v>

214
00:11:20.001 --> 00:11:23.630
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the planet where you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about supporting this.</v>

215
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.290
<v Speaker 2>This guy who blew the whistle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a fundraiser for him online.</v>

216
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:31.040
<v Speaker 2>He could use some money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to sue google.</v>

217
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:36.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thank you.</v>

218
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:39.750
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we could let</v>

219
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:44.750
<v Speaker 2>them know that hiring a human resources </v>
<v Speaker 2>director who's also concerned with </v>

220
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:48.630
<v Speaker 2>equity is probably not a good idea for </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalist company.</v>

221
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.810
<v Speaker 2>Why in the world would you hire your own</v>
<v Speaker 2>enemies?</v>

222
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

223
00:11:55.421 --> 00:12:00.421
<v Speaker 2>we'll see how the dialogue continues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but back to the personal like you need </v>

224
00:12:01.541 --> 00:12:05.680
<v Speaker 2>to say what you think because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you come from.</v>

225
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't say what you think,</v>

226
00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:11.680
<v Speaker 2>then you kill your unborn self.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you do.</v>

227
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:14.080
<v Speaker 2>That's what Cain did when he killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>Abel.</v>

228
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.330
<v Speaker 2>And that's why his punishment was </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbearable.</v>

229
00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.540
<v Speaker 2>You know you have things in you that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>struggling to come to the light.</v>

230
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:21.670
<v Speaker 2>That's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need daughter and you need to either</v>

231
00:12:21.671 --> 00:12:25.720
<v Speaker 2>that truth because without that truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cannot live in the world because the</v>

232
00:12:25.721 --> 00:12:28.330
<v Speaker 2>world is real and you need truth to live</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>

233
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.400
<v Speaker 2>And if you stifle your truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

234
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:35.850
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can that be anything but something </v>

235
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:36.040
<v Speaker 2>that brings about hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could it be any other way?</v>

236
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.570
<v Speaker 2>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

237
00:12:37.571 --> 00:12:42.571
<v Speaker 2>why should you speak up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's easy because the consequences of </v>

238
00:12:42.571 --> 00:12:44.440
<v Speaker 2>not speaking up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although delayed are far worse.</v>

239
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.420
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason.</v>

240
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:46.760
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

241
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:50.080
<v Speaker 2>if it can't be courage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could at least be prudent.</v>

242
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.090
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
