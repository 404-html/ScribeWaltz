00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes things do not go well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's self evident,</v>

2
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>but here's the rub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes when things are not going </v>

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.311
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's precisely that which is most </v>

4
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:17.671
<v Speaker 1>valued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the cause why?</v>

5
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.570
<v Speaker 1>It's because the world is revealed </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the template of your values.</v>

6
00:00:22.571 --> 00:00:25.930
<v Speaker 1>If the world you are seeing is not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world you want,</v>

7
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.320
<v Speaker 1>therefore it's time to examine your </v>
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>

8
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.370
<v Speaker 1>It's time to rid yourself of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>current presuppositions.</v>

9
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.300
<v Speaker 1>There's a famous experiment that I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>alluded to a couple of times I believe </v>

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.230
<v Speaker 1>in this lecture series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the invisible gorilla experiment,</v>

11
00:00:41.231 --> 00:00:44.740
<v Speaker 1>and in the invisible gorilla experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two teams</v>

12
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.340
<v Speaker 1>of players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each with three members,</v>

13
00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:50.470
<v Speaker 1>one dressed in black and the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>dressed in white,</v>

14
00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:55.471
<v Speaker 1>and each team is passing the basketball </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and forth to the team members and </v>

15
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>milling about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see a video of them doing so.</v>

16
00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:04.381
<v Speaker 1>They've basically filled the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen and the white team is passing a </v>

17
00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:08.311
<v Speaker 1>basketball to the white team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Members in the block team is passing a </v>

18
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 1>basketball to the black team members and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your job as,</v>

19
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.210
<v Speaker 1>as far as the experimenters concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is for you to count the number of times </v>

20
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>that the black black team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black team passes the basketball back </v>

21
00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:21.340
<v Speaker 1>and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what you do.</v>

22
00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:26.341
<v Speaker 1>So now you have an ambition and a name </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a value and the ambition and the aim</v>

23
00:01:26.891 --> 00:01:31.891
<v Speaker 1>and the value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all the same thing and that is </v>

24
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:31.990
<v Speaker 1>to perform well at the task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing that's so cool about this,</v>

25
00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:35.110
<v Speaker 1>and this is really so cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just unbelievably.</v>

26
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.380
<v Speaker 1>It's just unbelievable that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

27
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like a complete validation of of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain element of the Buddhist </v>

28
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.311
<v Speaker 1>worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they pass the ball for a couple of </v>

29
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 1>minutes and then the experimenter says </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>

30
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.210
<v Speaker 1>how many?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you say 15 and because you're happy </v>

31
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.210
<v Speaker 1>and you're happy with yourself because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been paying attention,</v>

32
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.960
<v Speaker 1>and then the experimenter says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

33
00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:57.160
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe not.</v>

34
00:01:57.161 --> 00:01:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you missed one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the experimenter says,</v>

35
00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:02.710
<v Speaker 1>did you see the gorilla?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And half of you say,</v>

36
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.090
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

37
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.370
<v Speaker 1>What gorilla?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

38
00:02:06.371 --> 00:02:09.460
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he and the experimenter says yes,</v>

39
00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:14.461
<v Speaker 1>and then he rewinds it and plays the </v>
<v Speaker 1>video and like a minute and a half into </v>

40
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:15.670
<v Speaker 1>the three minute video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure enough,</v>

41
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.030
<v Speaker 1>in walks this guy in a gorilla suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six foot three or so stands in the </v>

42
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.310
<v Speaker 1>middle of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in the middle of the game,</v>

43
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.850
<v Speaker 1>the same size as the players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly obviously evident beats his </v>

44
00:02:30.821 --> 00:02:35.821
<v Speaker 1>chest for like a second and a half and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then sorta saunders off and half the </v>

45
00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:39.760
<v Speaker 1>people who watch the video don't see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gorilla,</v>

46
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.910
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely shocking.</v>

47
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.910
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambitions blind you to the nature of </v>

48
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.140
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they eliminate some reality,</v>

49
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.610
<v Speaker 1>but they blind you to most of it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine because you're not.</v>

50
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.830
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some ways,</v>

51
00:02:56.831 --> 00:03:01.831
<v Speaker 1>you're very pinpoint thing like a laser </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you just can't be attending to </v>

52
00:03:01.831 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>everything all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things that you might ask</v>

53
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:09.361
<v Speaker 1>yourself once you know that is that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're suffering dreadfully than one </v>

54
00:03:09.361 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you're so fixed on the point.</v>

55
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.550
<v Speaker 1>You're so fixed on a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you're so fixed on the </v>

56
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.351
<v Speaker 1>point that you're fixed on might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrally related to why things are </v>

57
00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>going so catastrophic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really wrong now,</v>

58
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:30.001
<v Speaker 1>perhaps not because you know there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of arbitrary ness about life and </v>

59
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>perhaps you suffer even when you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>deserve to.</v>

60
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>That seems to happen in the book of job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

61
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.570
<v Speaker 1>because job is a good guy and God has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bet with Satan,</v>

62
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:42.571
<v Speaker 1>which seems like another relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty thing to do to let's say just </v>

63
00:03:42.571 --> 00:03:46.081
<v Speaker 1>torture him and he does quite nicely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see if he'll turn against God and it </v>

64
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 1>seems like a rather playground sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing for God to engage in.</v>

65
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>But the point is is that even in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>document like the Old Testament,</v>

66
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:01.861
<v Speaker 1>there's ample suggestion that sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>people just get wiped out and hurt even </v>

67
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:07.150
<v Speaker 1>if they're living good moral lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aiming properly and all that.</v>

68
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 1>There's an arbitrary agnes in life </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not radical,</v>

69
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:16.471
<v Speaker 1>but it's possible that it's what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinging to that's hurting you and it's </v>

70
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 1>even possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that you're clinging to</v>

71
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:25.711
<v Speaker 1>the hardest that's hurting you the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could easily be someone you love </v>

72
00:04:25.711 --> 00:04:28.741
<v Speaker 1>like lots of times I see people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>therapy and they're miserable for one </v>

73
00:04:28.741 --> 00:04:32.641
<v Speaker 1>reason or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's because they have a very </v>

74
00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>close relationship with a family member </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that just isn't working.</v>

75
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.990
<v Speaker 1>You know the family member for the sake </v>
<v Speaker 1>of simplicity we'll say is not really </v>

76
00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:43.480
<v Speaker 1>oriented towards helping them have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good life.</v>

77
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.900
<v Speaker 1>The family member is instead oriented </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards making them as bloody miserable </v>

78
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.140
<v Speaker 1>as you can possibly make anyone and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

79
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Exploiting the bond between family </v>
<v Speaker 1>members in order to enable that and then</v>

80
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:05.190
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the sacrifice that's necessary</v>
<v Speaker 1>is either merely distancing yourself </v>

81
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:12.181
<v Speaker 1>from that person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes substantively and sometimes </v>

82
00:05:12.181 --> 00:05:16.650
<v Speaker 1>seriously distancing yourself from like </v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't talk anymore ever and so that's</v>

83
00:05:18.161 --> 00:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn rough and it hurts and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

84
00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:24.970
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a good example of the fact that</v>

85
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:29.971
<v Speaker 1>sometimes in order to extract yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the miserable bit of chaos that you</v>

86
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:36.751
<v Speaker 1>happen to be in meshed in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to let go of what you love </v>

87
00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:40.140
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the world you are seeing is not the </v>

88
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.011
<v Speaker 1>world you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore it's time to examine your </v>

89
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 1>values are it's really worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really worth thinking about because</v>

90
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:48.760
<v Speaker 1>the alternative to is to curse fate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

91
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Because if it isn't you and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing you can do to change,</v>

92
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 1>there isn't something you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

93
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Then it's faded itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the world itself.</v>

94
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:58.910
<v Speaker 1>It's other people let's say because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a huge part of the world or it's</v>

95
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:03.911
<v Speaker 1>the nature of the world itself or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's God himself in whatever forum </v>

96
00:06:03.911 --> 00:06:08.861
<v Speaker 1>you either believe in or don't believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>in because it's fundamentally all the </v>

97
00:06:08.861 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 1>same in this sort of situation that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing.</v>

98
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.820
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's really </v>

99
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.651
<v Speaker 1>interesting and I mentioned this before </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the Israelites in the Old </v>

100
00:06:17.651 --> 00:06:17.651
<v Speaker 1>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they,</v>

101
00:06:17.651 --> 00:06:21.970
<v Speaker 1>they got this right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really something because what </v>

102
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.721
<v Speaker 1>happens to the Israelites over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Old Testament is that they get </v>

103
00:06:25.721 --> 00:06:26.930
<v Speaker 1>all puffed up about how wonderful they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

104
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:31.931
<v Speaker 1>and then they make moral errors because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're arrogant and then God comes </v>

105
00:06:31.931 --> 00:06:35.981
<v Speaker 1>along and just cuts them into pieces for</v>
<v Speaker 1>like generation after generation and </v>

106
00:06:35.981 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 1>they wobbled back to their feet and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>always maintain the same attitude,</v>

107
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:42.140
<v Speaker 1>which is we did something wrong.</v>

108
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>We did something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

109
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.060
<v Speaker 1>it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an axiom rather than </v>

110
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.091
<v Speaker 1>observation is that if we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if things are not laying themselves out </v>

111
00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:55.310
<v Speaker 1>for us as they should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we cannot curse God.</v>

112
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.180
<v Speaker 1>We have to look to ourselves while and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

113
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not curse?</v>

114
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:02.960
<v Speaker 1>God knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's his fault.</v>

115
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.640
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good question and one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that I've tried to figure out</v>

116
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.610
<v Speaker 1>over the last 30 years is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

117
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:15.611
<v Speaker 1>why not just curse God?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there is this arbitrary element </v>

118
00:07:15.611 --> 00:07:18.941
<v Speaker 1>to existence and we are vulnerable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is plenty of suffering and things </v>

119
00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:20.120
<v Speaker 1>are unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's problems,</v>

120
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:22.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's injustice and unfairness and all</v>

121
00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>of these things and an endless </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

122
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:29.111
<v Speaker 1>So why not just laid at the feet of God </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the whether God exists or not in </v>

123
00:07:29.111 --> 00:07:30.350
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

124
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.310
<v Speaker 1>with regards to the metaphysics of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular discussion is not relevant.</v>

125
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:39.310
<v Speaker 1>It's the point remains the same either </v>
<v Speaker 1>way and the answer is as far as I can </v>

126
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:44.171
<v Speaker 1>tell that if you refuse to take on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility yourself and you </v>

127
00:07:44.751 --> 00:07:49.751
<v Speaker 1>attempted to lay it at the feet of </v>
<v Speaker 1>either society or being itself,</v>

128
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 1>then you instantly start to act in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes everything much worse,</v>

129
00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.340
<v Speaker 1>not only for you but for everyone else </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even for being itself and so </v>

130
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.440
<v Speaker 1>it's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

131
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:05.840
<v Speaker 1>if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you decide that it's you,</v>

132
00:08:05.841 --> 00:08:08.270
<v Speaker 1>you've got the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's not even true.</v>

133
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:13.271
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you are someone who's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>tortured by the bet between God and </v>

134
00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:15.410
<v Speaker 1>Satan and like too bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that happens to be the case,</v>

135
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.680
<v Speaker 1>but it still seems to be the appropriate</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing for a human being who's standing </v>

136
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:27.701
<v Speaker 1>on his or her own two feet in a proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>manner to take the responsibility on for</v>

137
00:08:29.481 --> 00:08:30.140
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

138
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Regardless of the counter arguments that</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be made against,</v>

139
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.160
<v Speaker 1>that's really something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's time to rid yourself of your </v>

140
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.931
<v Speaker 1>current presuppositions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think of that it's a deadwood </v>

141
00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:43.931
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

142
00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:47.770
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you see with motifs </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the pair of the Phoenix,</v>

143
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.420
<v Speaker 1>remember when Harry Potter goes off to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

144
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:55.960
<v Speaker 1>he's like St George.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes off to fight the hell is that </v>

145
00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basilisk that turns you to stone.</v>

146
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 1>When you look at it to dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes,</v>

147
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:01.540
<v Speaker 1>it's guarding avert urgent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's her name for?</v>

148
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Not Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's close to that though.</v>

149
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Jenny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jenny Ginevra,</v>

150
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:11.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is a variant of virgin and very </v>

151
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.030
<v Speaker 1>introvert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Virginia.</v>

152
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he gets bitten by the,</v>

153
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:16.950
<v Speaker 1>by the dragon and poisoned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the dragon of chaos,</v>

154
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:21.951
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that turns you to stone when </v>

155
00:09:21.951 --> 00:09:21.951
<v Speaker 1>you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he gets bitten by it,</v>

156
00:09:21.951 --> 00:09:23.700
<v Speaker 1>then he's going to die and yeah.</v>

157
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get bitten by the thing that </v>

158
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:28.700
<v Speaker 1>turns you to stone when you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it bites you,</v>

159
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not dead,</v>

160
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna wish you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the two.</v>

161
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:36.430
<v Speaker 1>And then the phoenix flies in and cries </v>
<v Speaker 1>tears into the wound and that heals </v>

162
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:37.710
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Phoenix is the thing that allows</v>

163
00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:42.660
<v Speaker 1>the dead wood to burn off occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

164
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

165
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:47.961
<v Speaker 1>I think it's once every hundred years </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Phoenix and of course it's </v>

166
00:09:47.961 --> 00:09:50.691
<v Speaker 1>pretty dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole damn bird has to go up in </v>

167
00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:50.691
<v Speaker 1>flames and then there's nothing left but</v>
<v Speaker 1>an egg.</v>

168
00:09:50.691 --> 00:09:52.460
<v Speaker 1>But there's a very serious message there</v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

169
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:57.470
<v Speaker 1>which is that you can compare yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense to a forest fire,</v>

170
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.900
<v Speaker 1>to a forest in a forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to burn now and then for the </v>

171
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.111
<v Speaker 1>deadwood to clear so that the forest can</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually maintain its continued </v>

172
00:10:06.111 --> 00:10:06.111
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

173
00:10:06.111 --> 00:10:08.940
<v Speaker 1>And if you stop the forest from burning </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a prolonged period of time,</v>

174
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:13.941
<v Speaker 1>which happened in the United States when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to manage the forest </v>

175
00:10:13.941 --> 00:10:17.241
<v Speaker 1>fires too tightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all that happens is the dead would </v>

176
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:20.390
<v Speaker 1>accumulate and accumulate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulates and accumulates and </v>

177
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:21.790
<v Speaker 1>accumulates until the whole damn forest </v>
<v Speaker 1>is dead wood.</v>

178
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.590
<v Speaker 1>And then lightning hits it and it burned</v>
<v Speaker 1>so hot that it burns the topsoil off.</v>

179
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.800
<v Speaker 1>And then there's nothing left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing grows.</v>

180
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:33.801
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a good moral lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is don't wait too long to let the </v>

181
00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:34.560
<v Speaker 1>dam did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would burn off,</v>

182
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:39.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little self immolation on a </v>

183
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.861
<v Speaker 1>daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might be preferable to burning yourself </v>

184
00:10:42.861 --> 00:10:44.910
<v Speaker 1>all the way down to the bedrock once </v>
<v Speaker 1>every 20 years or so because maybe there</v>

185
00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:46.800
<v Speaker 1>won't be anything left of you when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

186
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.490
<v Speaker 1>And you know that happens to people all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

187
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.750
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that happen to people many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times.</v>

188
00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.540
<v Speaker 1>The deadwood accumulates the mess around</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

189
00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:57.300
<v Speaker 1>gathers the chaos that they haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealt with accumulates.</v>

190
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:02.510
<v Speaker 1>And then one day the spark comes in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they burned so far and so fast that </v>

191
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.350
<v Speaker 1>there's not enough left of them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recover.</v>

192
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:08.460
<v Speaker 1>And then they're the people who've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>eaten by the beast there have been eaten</v>

193
00:11:08.461 --> 00:11:10.530
<v Speaker 1>by the dragon and now we're inside its </v>
<v Speaker 1>belly.</v>

194
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.560
<v Speaker 1>Another very common architectural motif.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while maybe a hero will come along </v>

195
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.400
<v Speaker 1>and rescue them or maybe they'll just </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay in there forever.</v>

196
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's a precursor to the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>

197
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's not something I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>recommend.</v>

198
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.010
<v Speaker 1>So a little medicine on a regular basis </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a lot better too.</v>

199
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Then total emulation on terms other than</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own sporadically.</v>
