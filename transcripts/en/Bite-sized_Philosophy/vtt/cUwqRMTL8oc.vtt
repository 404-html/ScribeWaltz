1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.020
<v Speaker 1>So women are much happier if you look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>national polls than they were saying in </v>

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.711
<v Speaker 1>the late 19 fifties in early 19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's partly because </v>

3
00:00:09.711 --> 00:00:12.600
<v Speaker 1>freedom and happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are not the same thing.</v>

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.720
<v Speaker 1>They're not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now I see young women all the time </v>

5
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.051
<v Speaker 1>struggling to figure out what to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives because they have no idea </v>

6
00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>how to have a job slash career and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.850
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's no answer to that.</v>

8
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.630
<v Speaker 1>It's a really difficult problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.640
<v Speaker 1>and there's all sorts of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I did a lot of consulting for law </v>

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.821
<v Speaker 1>firms for a long time about a decade and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot of clients who were </v>

11
00:00:34.821 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>extremely high functioning female </v>
<v Speaker 1>lawyers,</v>

12
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:41.121
<v Speaker 1>younger ones trying to figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance their career with their desire </v>

13
00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>to have a life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

14
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:47.331
<v Speaker 1>you hear all the time about women being </v>
<v Speaker 1>denied access to positions of power and </v>

15
00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 1>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the consequences of prejudice and</v>

16
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.100
<v Speaker 1>oppression.</v>

17
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

18
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is caused by the same thing </v>

19
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.860
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

20
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>You have got one causal principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful.</v>

21
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Now you're a philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can figure out everything with it,</v>

22
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.390
<v Speaker 1>so like the law firms cannot keep their </v>
<v Speaker 1>women in their thirties.</v>

23
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.000
<v Speaker 1>They cannot keep them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big law firms,</v>

24
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>they all leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

25
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Because the women hit 30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're brilliant.</v>

26
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent.</v>

27
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>They were deadly in highschool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deadly,</v>

28
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:16.230
<v Speaker 1>and university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They nailed law school.</v>

29
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>They whipped through there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Articling,</v>

30
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made partner by the time they were </v>

31
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>30 and it's like they're in a rocket to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top position.</v>

32
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 1>What do they find when they get their 80</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour work weeks?</v>

33
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.130
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's one of the things you </v>

34
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.130
<v Speaker 1>want to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

35
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.801
<v Speaker 1>you think that the people who run things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are sitting at home smoking big cigars </v>

36
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 1>and like telling their minions what to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

37
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.670
<v Speaker 1>That is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like the 19 twenties millionaire.</v>

38
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 1>That's on the cover of the monopoly </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

39
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Going sociological analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know lots of people like that and they</v>

40
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:50.391
<v Speaker 1>work all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the time from the second they wake </v>

41
00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:53.690
<v Speaker 1>up until the second they go to sleep and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't just casually work,</v>

42
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know some of you go to the </v>

43
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.131
<v Speaker 1>library for six hours and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I studied in the library for six </v>

44
00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:00.131
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

45
00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:01.490
<v Speaker 1>no you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You study for half an hour,</v>

46
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.520
<v Speaker 1>have coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you look through facebook and went </v>

47
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.840
<v Speaker 1>home and you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I studied for six hours and you're </v>

48
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.840
<v Speaker 1>happy about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

49
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.480
<v Speaker 1>bloody well you did partly because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>

50
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can only read through about three and </v>

51
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.880
<v Speaker 1>a half hours until I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm pretty good at it.</v>

52
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.240
<v Speaker 1>So these people who are running things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's corrupt people obviously,</v>

53
00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:23.180
<v Speaker 1>but the vast majority of them first are </v>
<v Speaker 1>self made.</v>

54
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Its second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so bloody efficient and smart.</v>

55
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.060
<v Speaker 1>You cannot believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they work 80 hours a week and most </v>

56
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.570
<v Speaker 1>of them happened to be mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>

57
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.690
<v Speaker 1>Because there are a small number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane men who will do nothing but work </v>

58
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.910
<v Speaker 1>80 hours a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And no matter where you put them,</v>

59
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:45.911
<v Speaker 1>if you put them in the middle of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest with an ax and all they would do </v>

60
00:02:45.911 --> 00:02:48.821
<v Speaker 1>is run around chopping down trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the issue isn't why aren't there more</v>

61
00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:54.080
<v Speaker 1>women in positions of power?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's why are there any men insane enough</v>

62
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.560
<v Speaker 1>ever to occupy those positions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

63
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>because we also know and the on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very clear what's the relationship </v>

64
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:07.261
<v Speaker 1>between money and wellbeing once you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have enough money to keep the bill </v>

65
00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:11.311
<v Speaker 1>collectors from your door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once you have enough money to stave </v>

66
00:03:11.311 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 1>off misery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of lower middle class,</v>

67
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>something like that in our society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little little lower than that,</v>

68
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>extra money does not help you.</v>

69
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>It does not improve your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why bother with it?</v>

70
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what the women in the law firms </v>

71
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.570
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like most of them,</v>

72
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>by the time they're in their thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't married,</v>

73
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.310
<v Speaker 1>almost all of them are married to men </v>
<v Speaker 1>who make as much money or more than they</v>

74
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.340
<v Speaker 1>do because that's what women go for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cross culturally four to five years </v>

75
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.121
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equal or higher in the socioeconomic </v>

76
00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:42.121
<v Speaker 1>status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So their,</v>

77
00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>their husband's already made $350,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

78
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I don't need much more money.</v>

79
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker 1>The man used money to keep track of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition by the way,</v>

80
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.710
<v Speaker 1>because all the male lawyers that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to,</v>

81
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 1>her usually real hard ass guys really </v>
<v Speaker 1>low in agreeableness,</v>

82
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 1>really high in conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like conservative types,</v>

83
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:04.381
<v Speaker 1>low in openness as well and they want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>win and the reason they care about your </v>

84
00:04:04.381 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>damn bonus at the end of the year isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even so much because of the money.</v>

85
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
<v Speaker 1>It's because they got a much bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>bonus than the other son of a bitch </v>

86
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.000
<v Speaker 1>sitting beside them and they're happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

87
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.430
<v Speaker 1>So there's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a real brass knuckles competition </v>

88
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.690
<v Speaker 1>that drives these sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we get things backwards so often in,</v>

89
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in psychology and in sociology.</v>

90
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:26.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not why there aren't more women in </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions of power to whiting.</v>

91
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Any men want those positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have no idea the amount of </v>

92
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that comes along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

93
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 1>You just imagine for a minute trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>run a billion dollar corporation.</v>

94
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.980
<v Speaker 1>You can't even bloody well balanced your</v>
<v Speaker 1>checkbook and there's dust bunnies </v>

95
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.151
<v Speaker 1>underneath your bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How in the world would you ever run a </v>

96
00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:48.360
<v Speaker 1>billion dollar corporation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things are complicated and you </v>

97
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 1>have enemies and they're trying to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>you out all the time.</v>

98
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 1>You look at apple and Samsung,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

99
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:53.980
<v Speaker 1>they're just torturing each other in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>courts nonstop.</v>

100
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

101
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're running a big corporation,</v>

102
00:04:57.161 --> 00:05:02.161
<v Speaker 1>you'll be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be handling two or 300 lawsuits </v>

103
00:05:02.161 --> 00:05:05.071
<v Speaker 1>at a time and that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just nothing compared to the </v>

104
00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>complexity of what you actually have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

105
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.890
<v Speaker 1>Stay on top of the technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly interact with your large </v>

106
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.211
<v Speaker 1>customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Travel all the time because you have to </v>

107
00:05:15.211 --> 00:05:17.740
<v Speaker 1>maintain the relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to regulate the politics inside</v>

108
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>

109
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no picnic and you think,</v>

110
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get a lot of money.</v>

111
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:29.101
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes you think that such a good </v>

112
00:05:29.101 --> 00:05:29.101
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

113
00:05:29.101 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 1>like if you're a half crazy and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of money,</v>

114
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:35.161
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be crazy a lot faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that frees you from all </v>

115
00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:36.990
<v Speaker 1>sorts of constraints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

116
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.030
<v Speaker 1>we know the data on lottery winners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're no happier a year later at some </v>

117
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>of them are done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they had had like a bit of</v>

118
00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:46.300
<v Speaker 1>a cocaine problem to begin with because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

119
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.540
<v Speaker 1>being stops you from dying.</v>

120
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.550
<v Speaker 1>If you're a cocaine addict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get enough money and the way you </v>

121
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.550
<v Speaker 1>go and you think yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

122
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.450
<v Speaker 1>you've got all sorts of bad habits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weirdnesses.</v>

123
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>If somebody dumped an infinite of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you,</v>

124
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 1>what makes you think you would unravel </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely?</v>

125
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.110
<v Speaker 1>It's highly probable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

126
00:06:04.111 --> 00:06:09.111
<v Speaker 1>so back to these women know what they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're 30 is they look around and </v>

127
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 1>they played hit partner so they'd hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pinnacle of their profession.</v>

128
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell am I doing this for?</v>

129
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Why would anyone in their right mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be woken up at three in the </v>

130
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.661
<v Speaker 1>morning and Sunday by?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're irate Japanese client who wants </v>

131
00:06:22.661 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>them to work for the next five hours </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonstop to fix this damn problem,</v>

132
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 1>which is going to cost them $100,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

133
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Or we'll find someone else to pay $750 </v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour or two to fix it right now.</v>

134
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>

135
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a masculine form of value that.</v>

136
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:42.941
<v Speaker 1>Because that's one of the criticisms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the law firms just adopted a more </v>

137
00:06:42.941 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 1>feminine structure of value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

138
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 1>what kind of bullshit is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason,</v>

139
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.890
<v Speaker 1>the reason that you get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's three in the morning on Sunday two </v>

140
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.960
<v Speaker 1>to talk to your Japanese client who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking out about their contract is </v>

141
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.920
<v Speaker 1>because if you don't jump the hell up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and do it right now,</v>

142
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 1>there's some starving associate who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably ambitious in New York.</v>

143
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:04.601
<v Speaker 1>Or pick up the pieces and two tenths of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a second and they're smart and </v>

144
00:07:04.601 --> 00:07:08.231
<v Speaker 1>aggressive and they'll take you out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it has nothing to do with masculine </v>

145
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 1>structures of values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the foolish ideas.</v>

146
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.260
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just law where this happened </v>

147
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.260
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 1>we know for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that female doctors were far fewer hours</v>

149
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

150
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.590
<v Speaker 1>So the more female doctors you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more doctors you have to have.</v>

151
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.830
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not complaining about women's </v>
<v Speaker 1>priorities.</v>

152
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that women are wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

153
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:34.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like the older I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more I understand that marriage and </v>

154
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.421
<v Speaker 1>family are a primary importance and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>more I see women in particular know they</v>

155
00:07:37.641 --> 00:07:42.641
<v Speaker 1>hit 35 or 40 and they're not married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have kids and they are not </v>

156
00:07:42.641 --> 00:07:46.511
<v Speaker 1>happy because what the hell are you </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do from the time you're 40 </v>

157
00:07:46.511 --> 00:07:47.690
<v Speaker 1>until the time you're 80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got no family,</v>

158
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.300
<v Speaker 1>you got no relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do?</v>

159
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Go Run your company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

160
00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:57.971
<v Speaker 1>Well if you're one in a thousand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will satisfy so you bloody well better.</v>

161
00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:03.551
<v Speaker 1>Make sure you're that one in 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're probably not because those </v>

162
00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:03.551
<v Speaker 1>people are rare.</v>
