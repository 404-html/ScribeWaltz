1
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to read a short story by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurt Vonnegut,</v>

2
00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:10.251
<v Speaker 1>Jr called Harrison Bergeron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The era was 20,</v>

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.470
<v Speaker 1>81 and everyone was finally equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't only equal before God and </v>

4
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.970
<v Speaker 1>the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were equal every which way.</v>

5
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was smarter than anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was better looking than anybody </v>

6
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.321
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was stronger or quicker than </v>

7
00:00:27.321 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 1>anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this equality was due to the 211,</v>

8
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>212 and 213th amendments to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution and to the unceasing </v>

9
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.820
<v Speaker 1>vigilance of agents of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

10
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:40.821
<v Speaker 1>handicapper general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some things about living still weren't </v>

11
00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>quite right though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>April,</v>

12
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:47.241
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still drove people crazy by not being </v>

13
00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:48.790
<v Speaker 1>springtime and it wasn't that clammy </v>
<v Speaker 1>month that the h,</v>

14
00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>g men took George and Hazel Burger on </v>
<v Speaker 1>his 14 year old son,</v>

15
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it was tragical right,</v>

16
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:57.300
<v Speaker 1>but George and Hazel couldn't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it very hard.</v>

17
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Hazel had a perfectly average </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

18
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.940
<v Speaker 1>which meant she couldn't think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything except in short bursts and </v>

19
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.421
<v Speaker 1>George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while his intelligence was way above </v>

20
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:10.371
<v Speaker 1>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had little mental handicap radio in his </v>

21
00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:10.371
<v Speaker 1>ear.</v>

22
00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:13.730
<v Speaker 1>He was required by law to wear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At all times it was doing to a </v>

23
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>government transmitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every 20 seconds or so,</v>

24
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 1>the transmitter would send out some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sharp noise to keep people like George </v>

25
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.690
<v Speaker 1>from taking unfair advantage of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>brains.</v>

26
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Speaker 1>George and Hazel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're watching television.</v>

27
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>There were tears on Hazel's cheeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she'd forgotten for the moment.</v>

28
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:31.950
<v Speaker 1>What they were about on the television </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen were ballerinas.</v>

29
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>A buzzer sounded George's head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his thoughts flattened panic like </v>

30
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>bandits from a burglar alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a real pretty dance.</v>

31
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:41.820
<v Speaker 1>That dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just did said Hazel.</v>

32
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Set George.</v>

33
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.080
<v Speaker 1>That dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was nice at Hazel.</v>

34
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said George.</v>

35
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.090
<v Speaker 1>He tried to think a little bit about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ballerinas.</v>

36
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.210
<v Speaker 1>They weren't really very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No better than anyone else would have </v>

37
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>been anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were burdened with sash weights and</v>

38
00:01:56.791 --> 00:02:01.791
<v Speaker 1>bags of bird shot and their faces were </v>
<v Speaker 1>masked so that no one is seeing a free </v>

39
00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:05.601
<v Speaker 1>and graceful gesture or a pretty face </v>
<v Speaker 1>would feel like something the cat </v>

40
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:05.601
<v Speaker 1>dragged in.</v>

41
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.240
<v Speaker 1>George was toying with the vague notion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe dancers shouldn't be </v>

42
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.331
<v Speaker 1>handicapped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't get very far with it </v>

43
00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:14.331
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another noise in his ear radio scattered</v>

44
00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:16.110
<v Speaker 1>his thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George winced,</v>

45
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.290
<v Speaker 1>so two out of the eight ballerinas Hazel</v>
<v Speaker 1>Song wince having no mental handicap </v>

46
00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:27.261
<v Speaker 1>herself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had to ask George what the latest </v>

47
00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:29.361
<v Speaker 1>sound had been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounded like someone hitting a milk </v>

48
00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>bottle with a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peen Hammer said,</v>

49
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:34.611
<v Speaker 1>George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be real interesting </v>

50
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>hearing all the different sounds said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hazel,</v>

51
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 1>a little envious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the things they think up or said,</v>

52
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:42.570
<v Speaker 1>George only if I was handicapper </v>
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

53
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:44.790
<v Speaker 1>you know what I would do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said Hazel Hazel.</v>

54
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:49.791
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boris strong re resemblance to the </v>

55
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>handicapper general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A woman named Diana Moon glamours.</v>

56
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>If I was Diana Moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clappers said,</v>

57
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Hazel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have chimes on Sunday.</v>

58
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>Just chimes kind of in honor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

59
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I could think if it was just chimed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said George.</v>

60
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe make them real loud.</v>

61
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:09.301
<v Speaker 1>Said Hazel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd make a good handicapper </v>

62
00:03:09.301 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 1>general good as anybody else at George </v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows better than I do.</v>

63
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:13.340
<v Speaker 1>What normal list said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hazel right?</v>

64
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Said George.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He began to think glimmering ugly about </v>

65
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.081
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abnormal son who is now in jail about </v>

66
00:03:22.081 --> 00:03:24.871
<v Speaker 1>Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at 21 gun salute in his head </v>

67
00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That boy said Hazel Dow was a Doozy,</v>

68
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:31.981
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was such a doozy to George who was </v>

69
00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 1>white and trembling and tears stood on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rims of his red eyes.</v>

70
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Two of the eight ballerinas had </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsed to the studio floor and we're </v>

71
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 1>holding their temples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden you look so tired,</v>

72
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 1>said Hazel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you stretch out on the sofa so</v>

73
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>as you can rescue your head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest your handicap bag on the pillows.</v>

74
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Honeybunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was referring to the 47 pounds of </v>

75
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.811
<v Speaker 1>birdshot in a canvas bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was padlocked around George's </v>

76
00:03:54.811 --> 00:03:54.811
<v Speaker 1>nick.</v>

77
00:03:54.811 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 1>Go out and risk the bag for a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>

78
00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if you're not equal to me.</v>

79
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>For Awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George weighed the bag with his hands.</v>

80
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

81
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't notice it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

82
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.090
<v Speaker 1>it's just a part of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been so tired lately.</v>

83
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Kind of wore out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said Hazel,</v>

84
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.910
<v Speaker 1>if there was just some way we could make</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little hole in the bottom of the bag </v>

85
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.971
<v Speaker 1>and just take out a few of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lead balls just a few two years in </v>

86
00:04:17.971 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 1>prison in $2,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine for every ball I take out.</v>

87
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Said George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't call out a bargain.</v>

88
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 1>I if you could just take a few out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you came home from work,</v>

89
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:32.311
<v Speaker 1>said Hazel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you don't compete with anyone </v>

90
00:04:32.311 --> 00:04:32.311
<v Speaker 1>around here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just sit around.</v>

91
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 1>If I tried to get away with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said George,</v>

92
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:39.571
<v Speaker 1>then other people get away with it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty soon we'd be right back to the </v>

93
00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 1>dark ages again with everybody competing</v>
<v Speaker 1>against everybody else.</v>

94
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you?</v>

95
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.590
<v Speaker 1>I'd hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said Hazel.</v>

96
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.950
<v Speaker 1>There you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The minute people start cheating on </v>

97
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.950
<v Speaker 1>laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think happens to society?</v>

98
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.740
<v Speaker 1>If Hazel hadn't been able to come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with an answer to this question?</v>

99
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.920
<v Speaker 1>George couldn't have supplied one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A siren was going off in his head </v>

100
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 1>wrecking it all fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said Hazel.</v>

101
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.790
<v Speaker 1>What would said George blankly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Society said Hazel uncertainly was.</v>

102
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that what you just said?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

103
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.770
<v Speaker 1>George,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the TV program was suddenly interrupted </v>

104
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.921
<v Speaker 1>for a news bulletin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't clear at first as to what the </v>

105
00:05:16.921 --> 00:05:18.730
<v Speaker 1>bulletin was about since the announcer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all announcers had a serious speech</v>

106
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:22.150
<v Speaker 1>impediment for about half a minute and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a state of high excitement,</v>

107
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:24.670
<v Speaker 1>you announced you're tried to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

108
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>he finally gave up and handed the bullet</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a ballerina to read.</v>

109
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.370
<v Speaker 1>That's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hazel said,</v>

110
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>if the announcer he tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the big thing.</v>

111
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 1>He tried to do the best he could with </v>
<v Speaker 1>what God gave him.</v>

112
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 1>He should get a nice rates for trying so</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

113
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen said the Ballerina </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading the bulletin,</v>

114
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.610
<v Speaker 1>she must have been extraordinarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful because the mask she wore was </v>

115
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.851
<v Speaker 1>hideous and it was easy to see that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the strongest and most graceful of </v>

116
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:54.541
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dancers for her handicap bags were </v>

117
00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:57.031
<v Speaker 1>as big as those worn by 200 pound men </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she had to apologize at once for her</v>

118
00:05:57.171 --> 00:06:02.171
<v Speaker 1>voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a very unfair voice for a </v>

119
00:06:02.171 --> 00:06:02.171
<v Speaker 1>woman to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a warm,</v>

120
00:06:02.171 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 1>luminous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>timeless melody.</v>

121
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

122
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 1>and she began to get making her voice </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely uncompetitive.</v>

123
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Harrison Bergeron age 14.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

124
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Nick Rockwell squawk has just escaped </v>
<v Speaker 1>from jail where he was held on suspicion</v>

125
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:22.421
<v Speaker 1>of plotting to overthrow the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is a genius and an athlete is under </v>

126
00:06:22.421 --> 00:06:24.620
<v Speaker 1>handicapped and shouldn't be regarded as</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely dangerous.</v>

127
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.540
<v Speaker 1>A police photograph of Harrison Bergeron</v>
<v Speaker 1>was flashed on the screen upside down,</v>

128
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 1>then sideways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>upside down again.</v>

129
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Then right side up the pictures showed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the full length of Harrison against the </v>

130
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 1>background calibrated in feet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>inches.</v>

131
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.930
<v Speaker 1>He was exactly seven feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of Harrison's appearance was </v>

132
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 1>Halloween and hardware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody had ever been born.</v>

133
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Nobody had ever borne heavier handicaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd outgrown hindrances faster than the</v>

134
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 1>h,</v>
<v Speaker 1>g men could think them up.</v>

135
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Instead of a little ear radio for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mental handicap,</v>

136
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 1>he wore a tremendous pair of earphones </v>
<v Speaker 1>and spectacles with thick wavy lenses.</v>

137
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.150
<v Speaker 1>These spectacles were intended to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>them not only half blind,</v>

138
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:10.151
<v Speaker 1>but to give them waning headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Besides scrap metal was hung all over </v>

139
00:07:10.151 --> 00:07:10.670
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ordinarily,</v>

140
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:15.671
<v Speaker 1>there was a certain symmetry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a military uniqueness to the handicaps </v>

141
00:07:15.671 --> 00:07:19.121
<v Speaker 1>issued two strong people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Harrison looked like a walking junk </v>

142
00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:19.121
<v Speaker 1>yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the race of life.</v>

143
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>He carried 300 pounds at the offset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His good looks,</v>

144
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:28.121
<v Speaker 1>the h,</v>
<v Speaker 1>g men required that he wear it all </v>

145
00:07:28.121 --> 00:07:30.101
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A red rubber ball for a nose keep his </v>

146
00:07:30.101 --> 00:07:32.561
<v Speaker 1>eyebrows shaved off and cover his even </v>
<v Speaker 1>white teeth with black caps at </v>

147
00:07:32.561 --> 00:07:36.020
<v Speaker 1>snaggletooth random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you see this boy said the Ballerina,</v>

148
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.490
<v Speaker 1>do not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I repeat.</v>

149
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.540
<v Speaker 1>Do not try to reason with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was the shriek of adore being torn</v>

150
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:43.860
<v Speaker 1>from its hinges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>screams and barking.</v>

151
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Cries of consternation came from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>

152
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:49.700
<v Speaker 1>set the photograph of Harrison Bergeron </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the screen,</v>

153
00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 1>jumped again and again as though dancing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the tune of an earthquake.</v>

154
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.210
<v Speaker 1>George Bergeron correctly identified the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake and well he might've for many</v>

155
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.240
<v Speaker 1>was the time his own home had danced to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same crashing tune my God sent </v>

156
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.850
<v Speaker 1>George.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That must be Harrison.</v>

157
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.780
<v Speaker 1>The realization was blasted from his </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind instantly by the sound of an </v>

158
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:10.780
<v Speaker 1>automobile collision in his head.</v>

159
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:15.230
<v Speaker 1>When George could open his eyes again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The photograph of Harrison was gone.</v>

160
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>The living breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harrison filled the screen.</v>

161
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Clanking clownish and huge Harrison </v>
<v Speaker 1>stood in the center of the studio.</v>

162
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:26.150
<v Speaker 1>The knob of the uprooted studio door was</v>
<v Speaker 1>still in his hand.</v>

163
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Ballerinas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technicians,</v>

164
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 1>musicians and announcers cowered on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their knees before him expecting to die.</v>

165
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.490
<v Speaker 1>I am the emperor cried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harrison,</v>

166
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.590
<v Speaker 1>do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here I am the emperor.</v>

167
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Everybody must do what I say at once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stamped his foot and the studio </v>

168
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.680
<v Speaker 1>shook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even as I stand here,</v>

169
00:08:42.681 --> 00:08:44.420
<v Speaker 1>he bellowed crippled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hobbled,</v>

170
00:08:44.421 --> 00:08:49.421
<v Speaker 1>and sickened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a greater ruler than any man who </v>

171
00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:49.421
<v Speaker 1>ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

172
00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:53.261
<v Speaker 1>watch me become what I can become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He toured the straps of his handicap </v>

173
00:08:53.261 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 1>harness like wet tissue paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tore straps guaranteed to support 5,000</v>

174
00:08:57.631 --> 00:09:02.631
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His scrap iron handicaps crashed to the </v>

175
00:09:02.631 --> 00:09:03.930
<v Speaker 1>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harrison thrust his thumbs under the bar</v>

176
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 1>of the padlock that securities head </v>
<v Speaker 1>harness.</v>

177
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:11.150
<v Speaker 1>The bar snapped like celery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harrison smashed his headphones and </v>

178
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 1>spectacles against the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He flung away as rubber ball,</v>

179
00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:16.110
<v Speaker 1>nose revealing a man that could avoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>thor,</v>

180
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:18.990
<v Speaker 1>the god of thunder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shall now select my empress.</v>

181
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:23.991
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking down in the calorie people let </v>

182
00:09:23.991 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 1>the first woman who dares rise to her </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet claim her mate enter thrown.</v>

183
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm all at past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then a ballerina arose,</v>

184
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:33.350
<v Speaker 1>swaying like a willow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harrison plucked a mental handicap from </v>

185
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.071
<v Speaker 1>her ear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snapped off her physical handicaps with </v>

186
00:09:37.071 --> 00:09:37.071
<v Speaker 1>marvelous delicacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last of all,</v>

187
00:09:37.071 --> 00:09:39.930
<v Speaker 1>he removed her mask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was blindingly beautiful.</v>

188
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Now said Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shall we show the people the meaning of </v>

189
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.910
<v Speaker 1>the word dance music he commanded the </v>
<v Speaker 1>musicians,</v>

190
00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:49.990
<v Speaker 1>scrambled back into their chairs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Harrison,</v>

191
00:09:49.991 --> 00:09:52.950
<v Speaker 1>strip them of their handicaps too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Play your best.</v>

192
00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:57.951
<v Speaker 1>He told them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll make you barons and dukes and </v>

193
00:09:57.951 --> 00:09:57.951
<v Speaker 1>earls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The music began.</v>

194
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.420
<v Speaker 1>It was normal at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chilly,</v>

195
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.750
<v Speaker 1>cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>silly and false,</v>

196
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 1>but Harrison snatched two musicians from</v>
<v Speaker 1>their chairs,</v>

197
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:10.560
<v Speaker 1>waved them like batons as he's saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>the music as he wanted it played.</v>

198
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.160
<v Speaker 1>He slammed it back into their chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The music began again and was much </v>

199
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.061
<v Speaker 1>improved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harrison and his empress merely listen </v>

200
00:10:20.061 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Speaker 1>to the music for a while listened </v>
<v Speaker 1>gravely.</v>

201
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.040
<v Speaker 1>As those synchronizing their heartbeats </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>

202
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:28.310
<v Speaker 1>they shifted their weight to their toes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harrison placed his big hands on a </v>

203
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.760
<v Speaker 1>girl's tiny waist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>letting your sense,</v>

204
00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 1>the weightlessness that would soon be </v>
<v Speaker 1>hers,</v>

205
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.850
<v Speaker 1>and then an explosion of joy and grace </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the air they sprang.</v>

206
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Not only were the laws of the land </v>
<v Speaker 1>abandoned,</v>

207
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:41.160
<v Speaker 1>but the law of gravity and the laws of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motion as well.</v>

208
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 1>They reeled whirled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swiveled,</v>

209
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:44.160
<v Speaker 1>flounced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capers,</v>

210
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.520
<v Speaker 1>gambled and spun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They leaped like deer on the moon.</v>

211
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.170
<v Speaker 1>The studio ceiling was 30 feet high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but each leap brought the dancers nearer</v>

212
00:10:52.171 --> 00:10:52.500
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

213
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:55.710
<v Speaker 1>It became their obvious intention to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kiss the ceiling.</v>

214
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:01.130
<v Speaker 1>They kissed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then neutralizing gravity with love </v>

215
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.911
<v Speaker 1>and pure will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they remain suspended in Arab inches </v>

216
00:11:04.911 --> 00:11:05.130
<v Speaker 1>below the ceiling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they kissed each other for a long,</v>

217
00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:09.030
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was then that Diana Moon clambers,</v>

218
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.120
<v Speaker 1>the handicapper general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came into the studio with a double </v>

219
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.451
<v Speaker 1>barreled 10 gauge shotgun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She fired twice and the emperor and the </v>

220
00:11:17.451 --> 00:11:19.290
<v Speaker 1>empress were dead before they hit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>floor.</v>

221
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Diana Moon clampers loaded the gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

222
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:28.160
<v Speaker 1>She aimed it at the musicians and told </v>
<v Speaker 1>them that they had 10 seconds to get </v>

223
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.611
<v Speaker 1>their handicaps back on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was then that the birds are on </v>

224
00:11:31.611 --> 00:11:31.920
<v Speaker 1>television too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burned out.</v>

225
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Hazel turned to comment about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blackout to George,</v>

226
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.580
<v Speaker 1>but George had gone out to the kitchen </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a can of beer.</v>

227
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:43.410
<v Speaker 1>George came back in with the beer past </v>
<v Speaker 1>while a handicap signal shook him up.</v>

228
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.680
<v Speaker 1>Then he sat down again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been crying.</v>

229
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.240
<v Speaker 1>He said to Hazel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

230
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.030
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about?</v>

231
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.660
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

232
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:57.820
<v Speaker 1>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said something real sound on </v>

233
00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:57.820
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

234
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.040
<v Speaker 1>George said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all kind of mixed up in my mindset.</v>

235
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Hazel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget sad things.</v>

236
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Said George.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

237
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Always do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said Hazel.</v>

238
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.270
<v Speaker 1>That's my girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said George,</v>

239
00:12:07.271 --> 00:12:10.120
<v Speaker 1>he winced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was the sound of a riveting gun in</v>

240
00:12:10.121 --> 00:12:11.530
<v Speaker 1>his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>

241
00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:13.810
<v Speaker 1>I could tell that one was a doozy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said Hazel.</v>

242
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.240
<v Speaker 1>You can say that again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saint George.</v>

243
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.220
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hazel,</v>

244
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I could tell that that one was a doozy.</v>
