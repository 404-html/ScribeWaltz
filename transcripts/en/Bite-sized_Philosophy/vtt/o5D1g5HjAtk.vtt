1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.290
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Soviet Union when soldier knits </v>

2
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:06.420
<v Speaker 1>and wrote about the Soviet Union and its</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologies,</v>

3
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.160
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of peaked in terms of it's </v>

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.481
<v Speaker 1>pathological authoritarianism when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>became illegal to complain that your </v>

5
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:19.791
<v Speaker 1>life wasn't going well and you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about how horrible that is say </v>

6
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:20.790
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

7
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>lots of times your life isn't going </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

8
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:27.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean this in some casual </v>

9
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:27.471
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe,</v>

10
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:28.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you have diabetes in your year and</v>

11
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're gonna lose your feet or </v>

12
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.140
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really not.</v>

13
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing trivial that's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

14
00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Something is not good or maybe it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic or maybe you're unemployed or,</v>

15
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.270
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see the idea and the Soviet </v>

16
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Union was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

17
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>we already have all the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is perfect already.</v>

18
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>That's what totalitarians think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

19
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:54.420
<v Speaker 1>if everything's perfect and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

20
00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.110
<v Speaker 1>then well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something wrong with you </v>

21
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>because everything is perfect after all.</v>

22
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.420
<v Speaker 1>And if you're suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what are you gonna come out and </v>

23
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.420
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

25
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>well then your evidence that things </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't perfect,</v>

26
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:11.541
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like a widow or an orphan in an </v>

27
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>old testament story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when the Kings got too high and</v>

28
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:17.481
<v Speaker 1>mighty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they wouldn't pay enough attention </v>

29
00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:17.481
<v Speaker 1>to the widows and the orphans and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the profit would come along and say,</v>

30
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>you know those widows and orphans a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>more important than you think they are,</v>

31
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't pay attention to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>property,</v>

32
00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:28.371
<v Speaker 1>then things are going to fall apart </v>
<v Speaker 1>around you in a way that you just can't </v>

33
00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:31.851
<v Speaker 1>even imagine and so well then you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of like your own widow in your own </v>

34
00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>orphan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get to say,</v>

35
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

36
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:37.341
<v Speaker 1>you know things aren't perfect yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm actually having still quite </v>

37
00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:37.341
<v Speaker 1>a rough time here.</v>

38
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.360
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to admit to your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>

39
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.570
<v Speaker 1>If you can't admit to your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

40
00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:47.571
<v Speaker 1>then you certainly see the suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the additional suffering.</v>

41
00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:53.361
<v Speaker 1>The excess suffering should be treated </v>
<v Speaker 1>as evidence that you're not doing </v>

42
00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:57.021
<v Speaker 1>something quite right yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be treated as evidence that </v>

43
00:01:57.031 --> 00:02:02.031
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something important that you're </v>

44
00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:05.271
<v Speaker 1>doing that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand how harsh that is and I'm </v>

45
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:08.871
<v Speaker 1>not saying that everyone who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering is suffering because they're </v>

46
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:09.870
<v Speaker 1>doing something in some simple way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong.</v>

47
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.170
<v Speaker 1>I was in an elevator once in a hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a very terrifying thing and this </v>

48
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>person got on who was just in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute state of shock,</v>

49
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

50
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.470
<v Speaker 1>it was really not good and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember how this happened,</v>

51
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:29.661
<v Speaker 1>but I engaged the person in conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just said that they had just </v>

52
00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:30.930
<v Speaker 1>been diagnosed with what looked to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>terminal cancer.</v>

53
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.350
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was horrifying about it was that </v>

54
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.290
<v Speaker 1>what they were doing was going over </v>
<v Speaker 1>their life in the elevator trying to </v>

55
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 1>figure out what they had done in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to deserve such a fate.</v>

56
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:46.371
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they immediately taken it on themselves </v>

57
00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:46.371
<v Speaker 1>as a moral failing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not what I'm saying.</v>

58
00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>You can't come up to someone who has </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer and say,</v>

59
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:54.081
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you weren't such a bloody idiot </v>

60
00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:54.081
<v Speaker 1>throughout your whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have cancer.</v>

61
00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens a lot more than you think.</v>

62
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.060
<v Speaker 1>And people who have diseases like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>get blamed for it.</v>

63
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's,</v>

64
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.350
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

65
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.450
<v Speaker 1>it's a more generalized attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is that if life isn't yet what it </v>

66
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have a response.</v>

67
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 1>You have a primary responsibility to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about it and the place to </v>

68
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.671
<v Speaker 1>start looking is to your own errors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fix them.</v>

69
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

70
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a safe bet,</v>

71
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:24.481
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're probably doing some </v>

72
00:03:24.481 --> 00:03:25.801
<v Speaker 1>things that you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have to be doing that if you </v>

73
00:03:25.801 --> 00:03:28.621
<v Speaker 1>fixed would make things better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's time to let go and to sacrifice </v>

74
00:03:28.621 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>who you are for who you could become.</v>
