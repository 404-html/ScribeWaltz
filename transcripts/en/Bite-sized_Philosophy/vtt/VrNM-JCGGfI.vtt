1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you see you don't see irrelevant </v>

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's most things you do.</v>

3
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:10.941
<v Speaker 1>See things that move you forward and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>do see things that get in your way and </v>

4
00:00:10.941 --> 00:00:14.520
<v Speaker 1>in the class of things that get in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>way are in determinant occurrences,</v>

5
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:19.521
<v Speaker 1>novel or anomalous occurrences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and almost everything that gets in your </v>

6
00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:23.121
<v Speaker 1>way is in some sense a novel occurrence </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you usually structure your </v>

7
00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:27.231
<v Speaker 1>behavior so that you don't go anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>where something wildly anomalous is </v>

8
00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:28.740
<v Speaker 1>likely to occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

9
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.800
<v Speaker 1>so not if you encountered an obstacle to</v>
<v Speaker 1>things happening at the same time and </v>

10
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.611
<v Speaker 1>one is that your movement forward to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your specific goal or sets of goals is </v>

11
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:41.991
<v Speaker 1>blocked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the second thing that happens is </v>

12
00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>you're faced with a mystery and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mystery is this thing wasn't supposed to</v>

13
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does exist.</v>

14
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.300
<v Speaker 1>So what implication does that have for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything?</v>

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.980
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's very,</v>

16
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:54.981
<v Speaker 1>very hard on people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do not like that at all and no </v>

17
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:54.981
<v Speaker 1>wonder because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

18
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>it's the constrained chaos that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath everything inhibited by your </v>

19
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.301
<v Speaker 1>contextual knowledge that suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 1>popped its head up into your world.</v>

20
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's like the shark in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie jaws,</v>

21
00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>which is of course a mythological story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly that and,</v>

22
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly what that movie signified,</v>

23
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.810
<v Speaker 1>a safe vacation paradise all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened by some subterranean thing </v>

24
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:26.361
<v Speaker 1>that can pull you down and and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroys the peace and the harmony of </v>

25
00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:27.840
<v Speaker 1>that particular community to dragon </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

26
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:28.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a hero myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

27
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>it's the story that people have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling forever,</v>

28
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.740
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what you can think,</v>

29
00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>you can think of that thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>re-emerges,</v>

30
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.780
<v Speaker 1>that shark that rises up from the depths</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that whale or that dragon or that </v>

31
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Predator or or the foreign invader for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that matter or the barbarian,</v>

32
00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>and they all fit into the same category.</v>

33
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.940
<v Speaker 1>That's what had been deemed irrelevant </v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly manifesting itself.</v>

34
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600
<v Speaker 1>And when you think about how much is </v>
<v Speaker 1>deemed irrelevant,</v>

35
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.090
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it's suddenly manifests </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

36
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly the purpose for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason for the,</v>

37
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.580
<v Speaker 1>for the trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

38
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

39
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.500
<v Speaker 1>I've eradicated from my </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualizations,</v>

40
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 1>99 point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine percent of everything.</v>

41
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>It's zeroed out and all of a sudden I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>made a mistake,</v>

42
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where I am.</v>

43
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's relevant when you don't know </v>

44
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.731
<v Speaker 1>where you are and the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since you don't know everything is </v>

45
00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:27.141
<v Speaker 1>relevant and you can imagine the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>terror that people who experienced </v>

46
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>paranoid schizophrenia are living in </v>
<v Speaker 1>perennially because what happens to them</v>

47
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:35.781
<v Speaker 1>is precisely that they undergo </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurophysiological transformations that </v>

48
00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:40.191
<v Speaker 1>makes everything that they once depended</v>
<v Speaker 1>on disappear and everything comes back </v>

49
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:44.640
<v Speaker 1>is relevant and that puts them in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>early stages of schizophrenia.</v>

50
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.310
<v Speaker 1>That's extraordinarily stressful </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurophysiologically,</v>

51
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.520
<v Speaker 1>so they're overwhelmed with cortisol and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their brains don't deteriorate as a </v>

52
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.380
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that is just too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so unsurprisingly,</v>

53
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you can't deal with.</v>

54
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>You can deal with anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let alone with everything.</v>

55
00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Now and often what you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's rarely conceptualized this way </v>

56
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.820
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the training of of of clinical </v>

57
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.351
<v Speaker 1>therapists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but often what you see when you are </v>

58
00:03:13.351 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 1>dealing with people who are in crisis </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't people who have a mental illness.</v>

59
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my experience,</v>

60
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:23.251
<v Speaker 1>that's actually quite rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's far more common is that the </v>

61
00:03:23.251 --> 00:03:26.731
<v Speaker 1>person that you're talking to has become</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed by catastrophe so their life</v>

62
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:31.420
<v Speaker 1>has fallen apart in some way that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing actually impossible.</v>

63
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe someone very close to them in </v>

64
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 1>their family that they were depending on</v>
<v Speaker 1>has developed a very serious illness and</v>

65
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 1>that's throwing their entire financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>state into utter chaos.</v>

66
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe they've developed a condition </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes it impossible for them to </v>

67
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.231
<v Speaker 1>work or you know you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine the potential range of </v>

68
00:03:49.231 --> 00:03:52.501
<v Speaker 1>catastrophes and they're coming to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>you because they're anxious and </v>

69
00:03:52.501 --> 00:03:56.041
<v Speaker 1>depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reason they're anxious and </v>

70
00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>depressed is because everything they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have ignored has popped its head back up</v>

71
00:03:57.611 --> 00:04:02.611
<v Speaker 1>and is hell bent on their destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And often you see people who are being </v>

72
00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:07.381
<v Speaker 1>attacked by five or six of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters out at the same time and it </v>

73
00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 1>isn't their mental illness that stops </v>
<v Speaker 1>them from being able to deal with it.</v>

74
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Although that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.810
<v Speaker 1>whatever weaknesses you have are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to interfere.</v>

76
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 1>It's the fact that what they're facing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is no damn joke.</v>

77
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 1>And if you were facing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd feel exactly the same way.</v>

78
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.410
<v Speaker 1>So then you're trying to come up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>practical solutions to these </v>

79
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.630
<v Speaker 1>tremendously complex problems.</v>

80
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very well,</v>

81
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 1>it's extraordinarily difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>

82
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:36.421
<v Speaker 1>people often don't come to a therapist </v>
<v Speaker 1>until they've exhausted their entire </v>

83
00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:39.220
<v Speaker 1>range of resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cannot figure out what to do.</v>

84
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:46.261
<v Speaker 1>in a situation like that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>administer antidepressants and maybe </v>

86
00:04:46.261 --> 00:04:47.650
<v Speaker 1>that'll help the person increase their </v>
<v Speaker 1>stress resistance.</v>

87
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.420
<v Speaker 1>But as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

88
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.510
<v Speaker 1>and it may be that because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed and have been brought down </v>

89
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.331
<v Speaker 1>that they are in fact exaggerating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>danger of some of the smaller monsters </v>

90
00:04:57.331 --> 00:05:01.351
<v Speaker 1>that are after them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but making the person more stress </v>

91
00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 1>resilient doesn't give them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

92
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:06.661
<v Speaker 1>a new job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it certainly doesn't bring back the </v>

93
00:05:06.661 --> 00:05:09.301
<v Speaker 1>person they've been living with for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>years who has a degenerating </v>

94
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:09.970
<v Speaker 1>neurological disease or some form of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

95
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Like these things are major.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

96
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:15.760
<v Speaker 1>I often see people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they're in a relationship,</v>

97
00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:17.500
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're rather isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>

98
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.400
<v Speaker 1>older people.</v>

99
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.850
<v Speaker 1>One of the partners is dying in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire financial situation has become </v>

100
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.961
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's not a mental illness </v>

101
00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:32.161
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they may have got into that </v>

102
00:05:32.161 --> 00:05:32.170
<v Speaker 1>situation because of one inadequacy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

103
00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:37.171
<v Speaker 1>but you don't even want to push that too</v>
<v Speaker 1>far because that sort of thing can </v>

104
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:40.621
<v Speaker 1>happen to anyone and and will in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to most people in one form or </v>

105
00:05:40.621 --> 00:05:42.210
<v Speaker 1>another at least at some point in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

106
00:05:42.211 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 1>So you want to be damned prepared for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

107
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.160
<v Speaker 1>You want to be prepared for that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bitter and harsh and anxiety </v>

108
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:55.621
<v Speaker 1>provoking and painful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're not ready that it's also </v>

109
00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:59.011
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And often you can stop things from </v>

110
00:05:59.011 --> 00:06:02.080
<v Speaker 1>becoming hell even though you can't stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>them from being bitter and painful and </v>

111
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.660
<v Speaker 1>anxiety provoking and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can at least delimit the catastrophe</v>

112
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 1>enough so that it doesn't permanently </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring you and the people around you down</v>

113
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not so bad,</v>

114
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

115
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.240
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell or at least it's a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than the alternative.</v>

116
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.200
<v Speaker 1>So this is the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

117
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>things object things are obstacles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

118
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 1>how big is the obstacle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same.</v>

119
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 1>It's the same question is how big is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Predator that's lurking outside the door</v>

120
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:32.801
<v Speaker 1>of our cave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same problem except </v>

121
00:06:32.801 --> 00:06:36.671
<v Speaker 1>construct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized abstractly and and I </v>

122
00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:39.281
<v Speaker 1>would say exactly the same systems that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're distant ancestors used to </v>

123
00:06:39.281 --> 00:06:43.871
<v Speaker 1>conceptualize the lurking Predator are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the systems that are activated now when </v>

124
00:06:43.871 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 1>you encounter the reemergence of all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters that you've ignored,</v>

125
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.900
<v Speaker 1>it's the same neurological platform you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

126
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:52.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could it be otherwise?</v>

127
00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Because evolution is a conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

128
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Everything about you is built on on </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient foundations,</v>

129
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:01.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very little new.</v>

130
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Certainly very little radically new </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes into existence.</v>

131
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 1>It's mostly tinkering with structures </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have been around forever.</v>

132
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Like your body plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

133
00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:11.960
<v Speaker 1>That's unbelievably old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you share that with.</v>

134
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.210
<v Speaker 1>You share that with lizards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

135
00:07:14.211 --> 00:07:15.800
<v Speaker 1>so it's incredibly ancient.</v>
