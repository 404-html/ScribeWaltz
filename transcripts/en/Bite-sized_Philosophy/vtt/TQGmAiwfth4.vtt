00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.290
<v Speaker 1>There's an old story about how to catch </v>
<v Speaker 1>a monkey in case any of you are </v>

2
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.090
<v Speaker 1>interested in how to catch a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you now you're going to know how to </v>

3
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.970
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First you have to take a large,</v>

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>narrow neck jar just large enough in </v>
<v Speaker 1>diameter at the top for a monkey to put </v>

5
00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:22.701
<v Speaker 1>a tanned inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to fill it partway with </v>

6
00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:22.701
<v Speaker 1>rocks so it's too heavy for the monkey </v>
<v Speaker 1>to carry.</v>

7
00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Then you scatter some treats near the </v>
<v Speaker 1>jar to attract them and you put some </v>

8
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.250
<v Speaker 1>inside inside the narrow neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gr a monkey will come along if you're </v>

9
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.141
<v Speaker 1>lucky and grabbed the goodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he'll want the ones inside the jar </v>

10
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:42.441
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then put his hand in there and grab </v>

11
00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:45.140
<v Speaker 1>what's in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you've set up your monkey truck </v>

12
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.931
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he won't be able to get his hand </v>

13
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>out because he's got the goodies.</v>

14
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Not Without unclenching his hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not without relinquishing what he </v>

15
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.971
<v Speaker 1>already has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The monkey coucher can just walk over </v>

16
00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:02.031
<v Speaker 1>and just pick up the monkey because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkey isn't into the whole sacrifice </v>

17
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>thing because he's just a monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

18
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>And so you can catch him as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of his own,</v>

19
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.360
<v Speaker 1>an regulated hypothalamic desires to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you say,</v>

20
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.980
<v Speaker 1>charitable to the Monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put out candy or something like </v>

21
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.011
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like how often does a monkey get </v>

22
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:26.451
<v Speaker 1>candy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably a little more motivated </v>

23
00:01:26.451 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>than you are to not let go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can get the point.</v>

24
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>The monkey catcher can just walk over to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the jar and pick up the monkey.</v>

25
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>The animal will not sacrifice the part </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the whole.</v>

26
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>That's actually a pretty good phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

27
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 1>it's the animal that will not sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>the part for the whole.</v>

28
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps this story is apocryphal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as an eccentric psychology professor</v>

29
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>once told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction lies to you in the most truth,</v>

30
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.290
<v Speaker 1>in the most truthful possible manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something valuable given up ensures </v>

31
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>future prosperity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something valuable,</v>

32
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleases the Lord.</v>

33
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Those are equivalent statements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One's more articulated.</v>

34
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:04.860
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first statement.</v>

35
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:09.861
<v Speaker 1>And the second one is more dramatic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more embedded in a collective religious </v>

36
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

37
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>what's most valuable and best </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed?</v>

38
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:18.321
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously that depends on the culture </v>

39
00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 1>and the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it least emblematic of that?</v>

40
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>A choice cut of meat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

41
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:22.350
<v Speaker 1>if you're a herdsmen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

42
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:24.450
<v Speaker 1>that that's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

43
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout human history,</v>

44
00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>meat has been a very valuable commodity </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it is,</v>

45
00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among chimpanzees.</v>

46
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Chimpanzees hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like to hunt,</v>

47
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 1>call us monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

48
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:39.201
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll basically start eating the damn </v>

49
00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:41.361
<v Speaker 1>monkey lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weigh about 40 pounds despite the </v>

50
00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:44.691
<v Speaker 1>fact that the thing is screaming away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's pretty interesting because </v>

51
00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:47.020
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that indicates is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>male monkeys mailchimp's,</v>

52
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.250
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones that do the hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't really inhibited that much when </v>

53
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.470
<v Speaker 1>they're in fear mode by what you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe as empathy and there's certain </v>

54
00:02:57.661 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>elements of human behavior are </v>
<v Speaker 1>reminiscent of that.</v>

55
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:05.131
<v Speaker 1>You see that sort of thing have merged </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and then in human battlefields when </v>

56
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.230
<v Speaker 1>groups of men seem to abandoned all </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal regulation whatsoever,</v>

57
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>to a degree that makes you wonder if </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal regulation even exists.</v>
