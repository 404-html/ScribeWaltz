1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.390
<v Speaker 1>The people turning out in vast numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every one of your talks in Australia </v>

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.380
<v Speaker 1>been oversubscribed massively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tells you that they kind of get those</v>

3
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>mortar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this being told,</v>

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that's so </v>

5
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>interesting about dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetipal themes,</v>

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal themes or archetipal because </v>

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.680
<v Speaker 1>they actually speak of the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>human experience.</v>

8
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.010
<v Speaker 1>That's why they last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's human nature and human </v>

9
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.151
<v Speaker 1>experience has a pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the capacity to </v>

10
00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>articulate that pattern as an individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>in part because your life is too short.</v>

11
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.310
<v Speaker 1>You just can't figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

12
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>the ancient representations of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns are everywhere around you.</v>

13
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.010
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them at the image you caught </v>

14
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.010
<v Speaker 1>onto them automatically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

15
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fall into them.</v>

16
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:48.240
<v Speaker 1>If you go to a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

17
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>because movies always express archetipal</v>
<v Speaker 1>themes.</v>

18
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>If you hear them articulate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

19
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew that.</v>

20
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>I knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know how to say it.</v>

21
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.560
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the platonic idea of,</v>

22
00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.430
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.790
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of learning as remembering your soul </v>

24
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>already knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have the words.</v>

25
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>And so when people talk to me about </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching my lectures,</v>

26
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.710
<v Speaker 1>let's say they say they basically say </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of two things,</v>

27
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's.</v>

28
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 1>If it's not just a simple thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say one of two things.</v>

29
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>A third of them say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter of them say,</v>

30
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.510
<v Speaker 1>when I listened to you talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as if you're telling me things that</v>

31
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:26.070
<v Speaker 1>I already know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

32
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's exactly right,</v>

33
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>because that's what archetypal stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>are there.</v>

34
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>The description of what you already </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

35
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.560
<v Speaker 1>but that can be articulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then who you are and how you see </v>

36
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>yourself and the way you described </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself all become the same thing.</v>

37
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 1>So that's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you're not at odds with yourself,</v>

38
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have.</v>

39
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.830
<v Speaker 1>Then you're a functioning unity and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you much stronger and more </v>

40
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.651
<v Speaker 1>indomitable than you would otherwise be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing that people </v>

41
00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:54.861
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is more like three quarters of </v>

42
00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:54.861
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they say,</v>

43
00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I was in a very dark place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was addicted.</v>

44
00:01:56.161 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was drinking too much.</v>

45
00:01:57.901 --> 00:02:02.901
<v Speaker 1>I had a fragment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did relationship with my fiance and I </v>

46
00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:06.021
<v Speaker 1>wasn't getting married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things weren't going very well with my </v>

47
00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:08.931
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My relationship with my father was </v>

48
00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:08.931
<v Speaker 1>damaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any ame.</v>

49
00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 1>I was wasting my time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some variant of that,</v>

50
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>some combination of those and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

51
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching your lectures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've decided to establish a purpose.</v>

52
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to tell the truth and things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are way better and I've.</v>

53
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.370
<v Speaker 1>And so let's say I've done maybe eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>or nine large scale public talks in the </v>

54
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>last two months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's probably 20,000</v>

55
00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:35.241
<v Speaker 1>people and about half of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a third to half of them estate </v>

56
00:02:35.241 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>afterwards to talk to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's about 7,000</v>

57
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:40.791
<v Speaker 1>people who have said that to me and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>people stop me on the street all the </v>

58
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>time and tell me exactly that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just wonderful.</v>

59
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.170
<v Speaker 1>You can't imagine how good it is to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to go to places you've never been </v>

60
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>and to have people stop people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>streets spontaneously and say,</v>

61
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life is way better than it was.</v>

62
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:56.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's so good and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've got like,</v>

63
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>35,000</v>

64
00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>letters from people since last August.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more than that.</v>

65
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I can't keep track of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's exactly the same thing,</v>

66
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>like three court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quarter of them say,</v>

67
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've given me the words to say what I </v>

68
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.830
<v Speaker 1>already knew was true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thank you for that.</v>

69
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.850
<v Speaker 1>I can see that in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so interesting because I can lay </v>

70
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.941
<v Speaker 1>out a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People go like this and say they're </v>

71
00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:20.341
<v Speaker 1>doing that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the lights are going on and </v>

72
00:03:20.341 --> 00:03:22.921
<v Speaker 1>that's a really wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's almost nothing better than that </v>

73
00:03:22.921 --> 00:03:22.921
<v Speaker 1>to watch lights go on when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to people.</v>

74
00:03:22.921 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just absolutely fantastic.</v>

75
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 1>But to get this response from people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My father,</v>

76
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my father's about 80,</v>

77
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>80 is 83,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think 81.</v>

78
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.910
<v Speaker 1>He's 81.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

79
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>I put him in charge of going through my </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewer email,</v>

80
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>which is an overwhelming job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now we've had discussions about this</v>

81
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:50.341
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's overwhelmed by the fact that so </v>

82
00:03:50.341 --> 00:03:50.341
<v Speaker 1>many people are writing and saying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

83
00:03:50.341 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

84
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.010
<v Speaker 1>I have a purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

85
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.050
<v Speaker 1>My life actually matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I finally realized that and I'm putting </v>

86
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.781
<v Speaker 1>it into practice and I'm bearing up </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the heaviest load I can imagine </v>

87
00:04:00.781 --> 00:04:04.621
<v Speaker 1>and it's really helping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like God and that's tens of </v>

88
00:04:04.621 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 1>thousands of responses now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's.</v>

89
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 1>It's you couldn't hope for anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>better than that.</v>

90
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.240
<v Speaker 1>There's zero harm in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

91
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just people putting their lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

92
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.040
<v Speaker 1>they're not mucking about with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and are trying to make broad </v>

93
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.040
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>

94
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Social transformation is about which </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no idea.</v>

95
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.050
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to make their immediate </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment better and it's working.</v>

96
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.270
<v Speaker 1>It's like great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

97
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.870
<v Speaker 1>You say the zero harm in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say as a former legislator,</v>

98
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:36.871
<v Speaker 1>that there's an enormous amount of good </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a country is only the sum total of </v>

99
00:04:36.871 --> 00:04:40.351
<v Speaker 1>the people that make it up to the extent</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they put together resilient </v>

100
00:04:40.351 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 1>contribute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to ask others to help them.</v>

101
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.190
<v Speaker 1>The stronger the nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the society and rapidly like.</v>

102
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:50.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I was thinking the other day,</v>

103
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.530
<v Speaker 1>some a journalist asked me why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience by people are responding so </v>

104
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 1>positively to what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The young men for example,</v>

105
00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:57.520
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

106
00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.110
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

107
00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

108
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

109
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually on their side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty happy that I'm really happy </v>

110
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.661
<v Speaker 1>that they're not wasting their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really sad to see that people are </v>

111
00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 1>disenchanted and nihilistic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed and anxious and aimless and,</v>

112
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.910
<v Speaker 1>and perverse and vengeful and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of those things.</v>

113
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:20.911
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to see people question whether </v>

114
00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:22.910
<v Speaker 1>that's necessary and then to start to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rise out of that.</v>

115
00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:24.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so fun.</v>

116
00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Like last night I was at after my talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so overwhelming.</v>

117
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't usually think about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

118
00:05:35.061 --> 00:05:40.061
<v Speaker 1>but I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was after my talk last night and so </v>

119
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:40.600
<v Speaker 1>all these people line up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have their 15,</v>

120
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.740
<v Speaker 1>15 seconds with me and they're kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tentative.</v>

121
00:05:42.741 --> 00:05:47.741
<v Speaker 1>They're excited and attentive when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>come up to talk to me and then they </v>

122
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:47.741
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:49.640
<v Speaker 1>15 seconds of time to tell me something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really listening to them and they're</v>

124
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.540
<v Speaker 1>hesitant about whether or not to share </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good news about their life.</v>

125
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.570
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's often because when </v>

126
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.800
<v Speaker 1>share good news about their life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't necessarily respond </v>

127
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 1>positively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

128
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>they don't give encouragement and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>need so little encouragement.</v>

129
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 1>It's just unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're telling me something good</v>

130
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:12.400
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

131
00:06:12.401 --> 00:06:13.270
<v Speaker 1>it's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

132
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 1>somebody says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

133
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting along better with my father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen him for 10 years and now </v>

134
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 1>we get along great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

135
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 1>the power of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't overstate the power of that </v>

136
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.720
<v Speaker 1>for individuals to get their life </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

137
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:31.721
<v Speaker 1>They individuals and unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful force and every single person </v>

138
00:06:31.721 --> 00:06:36.310
<v Speaker 1>who gets their act together a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>has the capacity to spread that around </v>

139
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:36.310
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

140
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a chain reaction and so it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lovely thing to see and that's </v>

141
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 1>fantastic.</v>
