<v Speaker 1>make you dislike them.</v>

13
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Speaker 1>So you're in the grocery store and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a four year old and four year</v>

00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 1>They're not that verbal.</v>

20
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.530
<v Speaker 1>they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could compare their behavior in some</v>

21
00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:54.531
<v Speaker 1>ways to pack animals like dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why they like dogs and get </v>

22
00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>along with dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They understand each other,</v>

29
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:15.990
<v Speaker 1>It's like they don't get sick of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soon enough,</v>

30
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.720
<v Speaker 1>go somewhere boring and dull.</v>

00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:45.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

45
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:47.430
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lie.</v>

46
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 1>You go home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids forgotten all about it.</v>

47
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go in their room,</v>

48
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:57.171
<v Speaker 1>they make a little drawing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all thrilled that they come out </v>

49
00:01:57.171 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>and show it to you and maybe they did a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really good job.</v>

50
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:02.631
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there are even a little guilty </v>

51
00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:02.631
<v Speaker 1>about having the Damn Tantrum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

52
00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:03.270
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not happy and you think,</v>

53
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nice and you go back to whatever </v>

54
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>useless thing you're doing and you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got that little bastard and you think,</v>

55
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't think that.</v>

56
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're wrong.</v>

57
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Not only would you think that you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>act it out,</v>

58
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.660
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't think that that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't know yourself very well </v>

59
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.620
<v Speaker 1>and so you got to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now a little kid is little and powerless</v>

60
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>while not as powerless as you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

61
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.450
<v Speaker 1>but fundamentally you got the upper hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've got the proclivity for </v>

62
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:34.791
<v Speaker 1>tyranny deeply rooted in you and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>better be real careful around that </v>

63
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

64
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I used to tell my kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:41.451
<v Speaker 1>when I was not in a good mood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he say like it would be better if you </v>

66
00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:42.870
<v Speaker 1>were in your room and they didn't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew what it meant,</v>

67
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were very young.</v>

68
00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>They could understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're a fine kid,</v>

69
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pat,</v>

70
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Pat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pat,</v>

71
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in a good mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things are likely to be unpleasant.</v>

72
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just go play in your room </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a while.</v>

73
00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like way they went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew how to play in their room,</v>

74
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't want them being around </v>

75
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.300
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't being going to be a good guy.</v>

76
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>And so in Kim's faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know they can handle that man,</v>

77
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>they can't handle lies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can handle that sort of truth,</v>

78
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like I,</v>

79
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>both my wife and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we very careful.</v>

80
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>It's like when we're starting to not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy with the kids,</v>

81
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.630
<v Speaker 1>with one kid or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was time to have a chat and figure </v>

82
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 1>out what it was that had gone off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rails and how we were going to fix it.</v>

83
00:03:23.441 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>So that we were like thrilled to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kid around.</v>

84
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing about kids is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be thrilled to have them around.</v>

85
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Not always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're tired,</v>

86
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 1>you're hung over like you've had a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

87
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 1>The kids cranky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not saying this is utopia.</v>

88
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the point.</v>

89
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.980
<v Speaker 1>The point is though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

90
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.170
<v Speaker 1>you can manage your relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your kids and you can have an honest </v>

91
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.561
<v Speaker 1>relationship with them and then it will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the best relationship with anybody </v>

92
00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:49.561
<v Speaker 1>you've ever had in your life.</v>
