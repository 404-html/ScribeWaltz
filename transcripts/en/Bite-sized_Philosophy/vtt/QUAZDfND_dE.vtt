1
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.060
<v Speaker 1>You hear the gallon attarian clarion </v>
<v Speaker 1>call everywhere.</v>

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Everything should be equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything should be equally </v>

3
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:11.960
<v Speaker 1>distributed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should strive for equity.</v>

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're a conservative,</v>

5
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.960
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we want are just hierarchies of </v>

6
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone's a neurosurgeon.</v>

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your father has a brain tumor,</v>

8
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.630
<v Speaker 1>you probably want a hierarchy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence for neurosurgeons so you can </v>

9
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 1>pick the one that's the best so that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>might not die.</v>

10
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>That's what a hierarchy of competence is</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.590
<v Speaker 1>For the postmodernists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no hierarchy that isn't based on</v>

12
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:46.761
<v Speaker 1>because they think the world runs on </v>
<v Speaker 1>power and that's why they're willing to </v>

14
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>use power to get what they want because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the only thing they believe in,</v>

15
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>but a valid hierarchy of competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's God.</v>

16
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:52.710
<v Speaker 1>We need those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

17
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.100
<v Speaker 1>We need the best plumbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need the best contractors.</v>

18
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 1>We need the best.</v>

19
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>We knew we need the best carpenters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need the best lecturers.</v>

20
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.290
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a hierarchy of quality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only so that we know who the best </v>

21
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:11.871
<v Speaker 1>are and can reward them properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so that we can reward them so they </v>

22
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>keep being the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you know if,</v>

23
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>if you have a great educator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a great leader,</v>

24
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.590
<v Speaker 1>if you have a great thinker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to reward them so they keep </v>

25
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>thinking and they keep educating so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell you something.</v>

26
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>It's not a reward for their intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

27
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a calculated move on your part to </v>
<v Speaker 1>suck everything out of them that's </v>

28
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>valuable as fast as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a hierarchy of competence is</v>

29
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:38.901
<v Speaker 1>for and the idea is that hierarchies of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competence don't exist is it's so </v>

30
00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:43.341
<v Speaker 1>cynical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a pathologically cynical idea </v>

31
00:01:43.341 --> 00:01:46.490
<v Speaker 1>and it's actually quite patently untrue </v>
<v Speaker 1>because here's an interesting tidbit </v>

32
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.490
<v Speaker 1>from the psychological literature.</v>

33
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you want to determine what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best predictors are for lifetime success</v>

34
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>in a Western society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

35
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>what would you hope for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about intelligence?</v>

36
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.670
<v Speaker 1>There'd be a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's hope the smart people occupied </v>

37
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>more positions of complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

38
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Because they're smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want it any other way?</v>

39
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then so and that's great.</v>

40
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.550
<v Speaker 1>The number one predictor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment in western societies is </v>

41
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.270
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means the system works.</v>

42
00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 1>What's the number to predictor </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness?</v>

43
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>

44
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a trademark or for hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who?</v>

45
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Who gets ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart people who work hard now that </v>

46
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.851
<v Speaker 1>doesn't account for every bit of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between people in terms of </v>

47
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>their hierarchical structure because </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies aren't perfect.</v>

48
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:38.631
<v Speaker 1>They're corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get to the top sometimes because </v>

49
00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:38.631
<v Speaker 1>there's psychopathic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although believe me,</v>

50
00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:42.981
<v Speaker 1>a hell of a lot less than you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>because a psychopath has to keep moving </v>

51
00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:47.001
<v Speaker 1>from place to place because once he </v>
<v Speaker 1>reveals himself as deceitful and </v>

52
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:50.361
<v Speaker 1>untrustworthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to go find new soccer's to </v>

53
00:02:50.361 --> 00:02:50.361
<v Speaker 1>fleece.</v>

54
00:02:50.361 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no distinction between a CEO and</v>

55
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:56.811
<v Speaker 1>a psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's only made by someone </v>

56
00:02:56.811 --> 00:02:59.630
<v Speaker 1>who knows nothing about psychopaths be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows nothing about ceos and c has </v>

57
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>something fundamental against the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalist structure because it's simply</v>

58
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corrupt,</v>

59
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.150
<v Speaker 1>sometimes greedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes short,</v>

60
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.210
<v Speaker 1>shortsighted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes running companies that are </v>

61
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.210
<v Speaker 1>doing their best to auger themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the ground.</v>

62
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.040
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 1>it's bad people running a dying </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>

64
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>but generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the case.</v>

65
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:25.051
<v Speaker 1>Our hierarchies of competence are </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonably functional and not only are </v>

66
00:03:25.051 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>they functional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're valuable.</v>

67
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>We need to know who the competent people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are and we need to reward them.</v>

68
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>And even more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to tell young people,</v>

69
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.510
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some hierarchies of competence </v>

70
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.510
<v Speaker 1>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a thousand of them.</v>

71
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Go be a plumber man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but be a good one.</v>

72
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:39.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being honest.</v>

73
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 1>One B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a plumber once,</v>

74
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the night,</v>

75
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>it was the night before we were putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>drywall in our house.</v>

76
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 1>We were redoing a house and he had put </v>
<v Speaker 1>in all the plastic piping,</v>

77
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was going to test,</v>

78
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 1>the joints are supposed to be glued </v>
<v Speaker 1>together with his pipe glue.</v>

79
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

80
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>I told her I had to test the joints and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

81
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to test my joints.</v>

82
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 1>They never leak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

83
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

84
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.510
<v Speaker 1>How about if I test them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went up on the third floor and </v>

85
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.630
<v Speaker 1>filled the pipes with water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capping them in the basement like you're</v>

86
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:10.180
<v Speaker 1>supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like half an hour later I had two inches</v>

87
00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:15.181
<v Speaker 1>of water in the basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were 30 leaking joints and that </v>

88
00:04:15.181 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 1>was the night before the drywallers were</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to show up so well.</v>

89
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>So he wasn't particularly competent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the point of that story.</v>

90
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:25.531
<v Speaker 1>But even more so he had put a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the plastic pipe outside where the </v>

91
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:30.691
<v Speaker 1>drywall would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it would have been sticking through </v>

92
00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:30.691
<v Speaker 1>the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I spent a frenetic night,</v>

93
00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sawing through plastic pipe and re </v>

94
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 1>gluing joints so that my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that the drywallers could come in.</v>

95
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.170
<v Speaker 1>What's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to be a plumber,</v>

96
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:43.171
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a good plumber because otherwise all </v>

97
00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:43.171
<v Speaker 1>you do is go out there and cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>

98
00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:44.470
<v Speaker 1>And we don't need people to cause more </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>

99
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.050
<v Speaker 1>We need people to solve problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

100
00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:48.940
<v Speaker 1>And so you can be a tradesman and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be,</v>

101
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.660
<v Speaker 1>you can make a lot of money as a trades </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

102
00:04:50.661 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a bloody reliable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honorable,</v>

103
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.820
<v Speaker 1>a forthright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive way of making a living and </v>

104
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.251
<v Speaker 1>there is a hell of a lot of difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between a working man who knows what </v>

105
00:05:02.251 --> 00:05:05.590
<v Speaker 1>he's doing and one who doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both in terms of skill and ethics.</v>

106
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you work with someone who knows what</v>

107
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:09.370
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a bloody pleasure.</v>

108
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.700
<v Speaker 1>They tell you what they're going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tell you how much it will cost.</v>

109
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.880
<v Speaker 1>They go and do it works and you pay them</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

110
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's happy and that's what happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have genuine hierarchies of </v>

111
00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.541
<v Speaker 1>competence and so you to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You listen to these panderers of </v>

112
00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:24.541
<v Speaker 1>egalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gallery,</v>

113
00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:25.570
<v Speaker 1>egalitarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equity,</v>

114
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.750
<v Speaker 1>and they failed to recognize completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are differences in rank </v>

115
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:31.660
<v Speaker 1>between people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not such a terrible thing,</v>

116
00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he wouldn't be a great lawyer like</v>

117
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people aren't,</v>

118
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean there isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you could be great at.</v>

119
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:42.730
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of hierarchies to attempt </v>
<v Speaker 1>to climb and if you fail in one,</v>

120
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.120
<v Speaker 1>go try and another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is you're still trying to </v>

121
00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.730
<v Speaker 1>aim for the top and what the hell are </v>
<v Speaker 1>you going to do?</v>

122
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>If you don't try to aim for the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 1>flap about uselessly and whine about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>

124
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 1>it's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will just make you miserable.</v>

125
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 1>You're not reliable to anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't help out in a crisis.</v>

126
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like so you tell young people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is another message for </v>

127
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.710
<v Speaker 1>conservatives like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care why you're going to do,</v>

128
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>but go out there and make something of </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself for God's sake.</v>

129
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:13.361
<v Speaker 1>Be An honest person and work and get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the top of whatever it is that you want </v>

130
00:06:13.361 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 1>to get to the top of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

131
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.900
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

132
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.240
<v Speaker 1>and stand up for yourself like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>respectable human being and be a bit of </v>

133
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.610
<v Speaker 1>a light on the world instead of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>blight.</v>

134
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can tell young people that and </v>

135
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.120
<v Speaker 1>they haven't been told that by anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

136
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.440
<v Speaker 1>And so the young men are so hungry for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

137
00:06:29.441 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's painful to watch.</v>

138
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 1>They're so relieved when finally someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally comes up and says,</v>

139
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

140
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.120
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get your act together bit discipline</v>

141
00:06:39.121 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can learn to tell the truth,</v>

142
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.980
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on something for a year or </v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

143
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.320
<v Speaker 1>You could be a bloody world beater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think freely.</v>

144
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 1>That's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

145
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 1>That would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be interesting.</v>

146
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.490
<v Speaker 1>That might make life or life worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>

147
00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:53.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

148
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:55.820
<v Speaker 1>it might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why don't you go do it now.</v>

149
00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.840
<v Speaker 1>That's what the damn universities we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be teaching people and </v>

150
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 1>they've forgotten that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to Harvard month ago,</v>

151
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:06.371
<v Speaker 1>month and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to teach there and I talked to a </v>

152
00:07:06.371 --> 00:07:06.371
<v Speaker 1>bunch of students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I told them?</v>

153
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.240
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to get into Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.510
<v Speaker 1>like you're a Valedictorian if you're at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard and not only are you a </v>

155
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Valedictorian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're way better than most people,</v>

156
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 1>at least two other things or you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it.</v>

157
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.230
<v Speaker 1>And so that gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the acceptance rate is</v>

158
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 1>like five percent and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everybody applies.</v>

159
00:07:24.231 --> 00:07:27.550
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very selective school and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I saying that?</v>

160
00:07:27.551 --> 00:07:32.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like these are high quality kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I told them what I just told you.</v>

161
00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:34.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here you are at Harvard.</v>

162
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 1>It's like get yourself educated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

163
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.150
<v Speaker 1>read some books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to talk,</v>

164
00:07:38.151 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 1>learn to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make yourself into something,</v>

165
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.700
<v Speaker 1>get the hell out there and make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world that put you here happy that you </v>

166
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.600
<v Speaker 1>were put there in that great </v>
<v Speaker 1>institution,</v>

167
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they came up to me afterwards and </v>

168
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:52.870
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

169
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I wish someone would have told us that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were in our first year.</v>

170
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

171
00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.090
<v Speaker 1>why didn't someone tell them that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>God's sake,</v>

172
00:07:59.091 --> 00:08:01.880
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>university in the world.</v>

173
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Is it so difficult to figure that out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

174
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:10.180
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that is what you want to have happen </v>

175
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.581
<v Speaker 1>in the university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to make cringing milk sops who </v>

176
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:14.030
<v Speaker 1>whined about being victims while they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to ivy league institutions.</v>

177
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pathetic.</v>
