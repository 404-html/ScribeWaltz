1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.370
<v Speaker 1>So what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:02.371 --> 00:00:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Kane makes his offerings and God isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy with them.</v>

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Now we don't know how cain figures out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that God isn't happy with his offerings.</v>

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.990
<v Speaker 1>We get some hints of that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the story does tell us that's what </v>

5
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.501
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then we get the psychological </v>

6
00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:19.380
<v Speaker 1>response on the part of cane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now one response could be,</v>

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must be doing something wrong.</v>

8
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I better straighten myself out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I better come up with a better quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>offering and try that again.</v>

10
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.510
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens instead is that cane </v>

11
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:33.480
<v Speaker 1>becomes angry wroth and his countenance </v>
<v Speaker 1>fault.</v>

12
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 1>And so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means this,</v>

13
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means he is not happy.</v>

14
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>He's angry and out for revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the.</v>

15
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about this a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>lately with regards to the literature on</v>

16
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.530
<v Speaker 1>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's a very good literature </v>

17
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.530
<v Speaker 1>that shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

18
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

19
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 1>there's a measure called the Gini </v>
<v Speaker 1>Coefficient.</v>

20
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.970
<v Speaker 1>The Gini Coefficient is a numerical </v>
<v Speaker 1>index of the relative inequality of a </v>

21
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.540
<v Speaker 1>geographical locale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

22
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:05.541
<v Speaker 1>if you went to Newfoundland where </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone is roughly not very rich or </v>

23
00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:09.021
<v Speaker 1>North Dakota,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say almost everyone there is say lower </v>

24
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 1>middle class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

25
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>or upper working class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

26
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Very little variability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low Gini Coefficient,</v>

27
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you go to Miami Beach,</v>

28
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:19.230
<v Speaker 1>say where everyone's rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low gini coefficient,</v>

29
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't an index of absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth or absolute poverty,</v>

30
00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>it's an index of relative poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if everyone's rich,</v>

31
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:29.400
<v Speaker 1>the relative poverty is low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if everyone's poor,</v>

32
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.510
<v Speaker 1>the relative poverty is low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now one question is where's the crime?</v>

33
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

34
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>the crime is where the absolute poverty </v>
<v Speaker 1>is high,</v>

35
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or the absolute wealth is low.</v>

36
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>That's where the crime is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong.</v>

37
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.820
<v Speaker 1>If it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If things are relatively distributed in </v>

38
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.750
<v Speaker 1>an egalitarian manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the male on male crime,</v>

39
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>especially homicide is low and it's also</v>
<v Speaker 1>the case where everyone is rich.</v>

40
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 1>But if you go into places where there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>some rich people but not very many,</v>

41
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.330
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparatively poor than the male </v>

42
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>homicide rapes rates and violent crime </v>
<v Speaker 1>rates amp up substantially.</v>

43
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.050
<v Speaker 1>And it's a consequence of male on male </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>

44
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.530
<v Speaker 1>and so what you could derive from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even reasonably is that you </v>

45
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.851
<v Speaker 1>should flatten out the damn income into </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution because you're </v>

46
00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:22.110
<v Speaker 1>destabilizing this society by </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitating male criminal aggression.</v>

47
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>You can make a good case for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

48
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:29.271
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in places like Columbia where the Gini </v>

49
00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Coefficient got unbelievably extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>society got so violent that it could </v>

50
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.880
<v Speaker 1>barely hold itself together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

51
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.180
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make a conservative argument for</v>

52
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:41.181
<v Speaker 1>redistribution of income using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>observation that if the income </v>

53
00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:44.691
<v Speaker 1>distribution gets too extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole bloody thing starts to </v>

54
00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:44.691
<v Speaker 1>destabilize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might fall,</v>

55
00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:46.260
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you also might say,</v>

56
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.530
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it any quality that's driving the </v>

57
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.660
<v Speaker 1>violence or is it resentment of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality that's driving the violence?</v>

58
00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough question because you </v>

59
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.620
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

60
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>what if the game is rigged and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no way of moving up the power hierarchy?</v>

61
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Well then maybe anger and the desire for</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution is the appropriate response.</v>

62
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:10.711
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't really mean to me that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the response should be that sort of </v>

63
00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 1>thing that you see in hygienic </v>
<v Speaker 1>coefficient neighborhoods,</v>

64
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>which is interracial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intra racial violence between men.</v>

65
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.730
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in neighborhoods where there's high </v>

66
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 1>murder rates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the murders are always between young men</v>

67
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
<v Speaker 1>and they're always within race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that doesn't seem to me to be </v>

68
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>exactly a politically revolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>move,</v>

69
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:35.641
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more like it's more like a violent </v>

70
00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 1>competition for the sake of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

71
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 1>of attaining status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you might say,</v>

72
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:43.051
<v Speaker 1>well that's reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because the inequality is there and </v>

73
00:03:43.051 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>then need to find status because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what drives them forward.</v>

74
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Speaker 1>It's part of what makes them attractive </v>
<v Speaker 1>to women.</v>

75
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

76
00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you attain status through destruction</v>

77
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 1>or do you start making your offerings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting your offerings in order?</v>

78
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's something we really need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out because that's a fundamental </v>

79
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 1>political question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fundamental political question.</v>

80
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens in this story is that cane </v>

81
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.281
<v Speaker 1>decides that the fact that God isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>accepting his offerings means that he's </v>

82
00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 1>entitled to become angry and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

83
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.320
<v Speaker 1>and negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those two things or both put together </v>

84
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's raw,</v>

85
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 1>he's angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's also depressed and so he's in a</v>

86
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:20.140
<v Speaker 1>state of mind that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

87
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:25.141
<v Speaker 1>I think the best characterization for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that as hostile resentment because it's </v>

88
00:04:25.141 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

89
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unfair,</v>

90
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.280
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to do about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you get destructive about it?</v>

91
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Are going to change your approach?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

92
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:37.561
<v Speaker 1>Kane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does the ultimate thing and this is </v>

93
00:04:37.561 --> 00:04:39.421
<v Speaker 1>what people do when they do the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing because that kind of hostile </v>

94
00:04:39.421 --> 00:04:43.480
<v Speaker 1>resentment has an architectural end </v>
<v Speaker 1>point and the architectural end point is</v>

95
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:48.481
<v Speaker 1>the point that you get when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>hostile and resentful because you </v>

96
00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:51.451
<v Speaker 1>haven't been successful and then you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit in your mother's basement for about </v>

97
00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:53.620
<v Speaker 1>10 years and then you start imagining </v>
<v Speaker 1>just how nice it would be if you shut up</v>

98
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:58.621
<v Speaker 1>the local high school so that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew your name and what happens is you </v>

99
00:04:58.621 --> 00:05:01.570
<v Speaker 1>go from I'm irritated because things </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't working out for me very well too.</v>

100
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm irritated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nine and a hate.</v>

101
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Those people for whom things are working</v>
<v Speaker 1>out well too.</v>

102
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm irritated and I hate the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is set up so that this has </v>

103
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.001
<v Speaker 1>happened to me and then you go to well </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm irritated and hate the </v>

104
00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do whatever I can that will</v>

105
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:20.050
<v Speaker 1>destroy it most rapidly and with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the highest possible amount of pain</v>

106
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:25.051
<v Speaker 1>and suffering conceivable and at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point then you don't just go shoot up </v>

107
00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:29.491
<v Speaker 1>the high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go up and shoot up the elementary </v>

108
00:05:29.491 --> 00:05:31.561
<v Speaker 1>school and so if you're wondering what </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of pathway people walk down to get </v>

109
00:05:31.561 --> 00:05:35.881
<v Speaker 1>to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the pathway and the ultimate cap </v>

110
00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:35.881
<v Speaker 1>of that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

111
00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

112
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll kill the kids because well we </v>
<v Speaker 1>already know that killing the innocent </v>

113
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.500
<v Speaker 1>is a lot more effective than killing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty.</v>

114
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.170
<v Speaker 1>And then just to cap it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll blow my head off at the end just to</v>

115
00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 1>show you just how God damn pointless it </v>
<v Speaker 1>all is.</v>

116
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.370
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the logical extension of </v>
<v Speaker 1>keynes attitude and you might think,</v>

117
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 1>well that's a bit of an overeating and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>will say it's not an overriding and all.</v>

118
00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:56.830
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly what happens in the text.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

119
00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:59.060
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly what follows it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So foreign.</v>

120
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.540
<v Speaker 1>So Kane is not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so who was he not happy with?</v>

121
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not happy with God.</v>

122
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.240
<v Speaker 1>And so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

123
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.300
<v Speaker 1>we've already unpacked this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not happy with the social contract </v>

124
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.660
<v Speaker 1>because that's part of the spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the patriarchal spirit,</v>

125
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:19.661
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's more to it than that </v>

126
00:06:19.661 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 1>because we already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've already analyzed what God,</v>

127
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 1>the idea of God might represent in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>background of this story.</v>

128
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.210
<v Speaker 1>He's not happy with the transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not happy with the idea of the </v>

129
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.210
<v Speaker 1>logos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

130
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:33.580
<v Speaker 1>No faith in the transcendent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but he does nothing but despise </v>

131
00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:38.591
<v Speaker 1>the social contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's got no faith whatsoever in the </v>

132
00:06:38.591 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 1>logos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the word that brings chaos out</v>

133
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:42.170
<v Speaker 1>of order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got nothing but contempt for all of</v>

134
00:06:42.171 --> 00:06:43.550
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

135
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 1>certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 1>people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't know them,</v>

137
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:51.911
<v Speaker 1>you just go on youtube and read the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments and you'll see all sorts of </v>

138
00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:51.911
<v Speaker 1>people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
