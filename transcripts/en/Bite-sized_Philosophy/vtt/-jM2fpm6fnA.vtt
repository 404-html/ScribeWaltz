1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.380
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an admirer of Eric Norman and off</v>

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Carl Young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.300
<v Speaker 1>That's the human connection is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because I think he's a </v>

4
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.181
<v Speaker 1>bloody genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the great mother is a </v>

5
00:00:11.181 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>great book and it really a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>warning.</v>

6
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:16.191
<v Speaker 1>That book and also the origins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>history of consciousness is influential </v>

7
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.080
<v Speaker 1>That's so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read an essay that you wrote,</v>

9
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember when it was at the Nyu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

10
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.430
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always been staggering to me that </v>

11
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.430
<v Speaker 1>that book hasn't had the impact that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>should have had.</v>

12
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean young himself in the preface to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that book wrote that that was the book </v>

13
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>that he wished that he would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>written.</v>

14
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 1>It's very much associated with young </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbols of transformation and it was a </v>

15
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>major influence on my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maps of meaning,</v>

16
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:44.151
<v Speaker 1>which was an attempt to outline the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal archetypes that are portrayed </v>

17
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:45.590
<v Speaker 1>in the kind of religious structures that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

18
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>that you put forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that I really see </v>

19
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can tell me what you think about</v>

20
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.341
<v Speaker 1>this and in Norman's book consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is masculine symbolically </v>

21
00:00:55.341 --> 00:01:00.321
<v Speaker 1>masculine for a variety of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is is viewed as rising up against the </v>

22
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:06.171
<v Speaker 1>countervailing force of tragedy from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying feminine symbolically </v>

23
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:06.900
<v Speaker 1>feminine unconsciousness.</v>

24
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's something that can always be </v>

25
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:12.540
<v Speaker 1>pulled back into that unconsciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the microcosm of.</v>

26
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:17.541
<v Speaker 1>That would be the Freudian eatable </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother femineity old dynamic where the </v>

27
00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:21.771
<v Speaker 1>mother was so over protective and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>encompassing that she interferes with </v>

28
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>the development of the competence not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only of her sons,</v>

29
00:01:23.551 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>but also of her daughters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of her children in general.</v>

30
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.310
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic that's being played out in our </v>

31
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.270
<v Speaker 1>society right now is that there's this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's.</v>

32
00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>It's related in some way that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand to this,</v>

33
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.920
<v Speaker 1>to this insistence that all forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine and authority or nothing by </v>

34
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.671
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the symbolic representation is </v>

35
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:48.350
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical father with no appreciation </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the benevolent father and benevolent</v>

36
00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>mother with no appreciation whatsoever </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the tyrannical mother.</v>

37
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's that.</v>

38
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.660
<v Speaker 1>And because I thought of videology as </v>
<v Speaker 1>fragmentary mythologies,</v>

39
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.790
<v Speaker 1>that's where they get their archetypal </v>
<v Speaker 1>in psychological power,</v>

40
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

41
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.270
<v Speaker 1>And so on and balanced representation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the terrible mother and the </v>

42
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.841
<v Speaker 1>great mother as as Norman laid out so </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicely and you have the terrible father </v>

43
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:13.641
<v Speaker 1>and the great father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the fact that culture mangles </v>

44
00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:16.460
<v Speaker 1>you have to death well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also promoting you and developing </v>

45
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.401
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to see that as balanced and </v>

46
00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:19.401
<v Speaker 1>then you have the heroic and adversarial</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

47
00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:24.290
<v Speaker 1>But in the postmodern world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this seems to be something that's </v>

48
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>increasingly seeping out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture at large,</v>

49
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>you have nothing but the tyrannical </v>
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

50
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Nothing but the destructive force of </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine consciousness and nothing but </v>

51
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.220
<v Speaker 1>the benevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>benevolent great mother,</v>

52
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:40.221
<v Speaker 1>and it's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an appalling ideology and it seems </v>

53
00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:43.131
<v Speaker 1>to me that it's sucking the vitality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what you would expect </v>

54
00:02:43.131 --> 00:02:47.181
<v Speaker 1>symbolically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sucking the vitality of our </v>

55
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:49.341
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that with the increasing </v>

56
00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>demolition of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of young men,</v>

57
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not only young men in terms of their</v>

58
00:02:52.411 --> 00:02:55.180
<v Speaker 1>academic performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which like they're falling way behind in</v>

59
00:02:55.181 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>elementary school way behind in junior </v>
<v Speaker 1>high and bailing out of the universities</v>

60
00:02:58.651 --> 00:02:59.430
<v Speaker 1>like mad.</v>
