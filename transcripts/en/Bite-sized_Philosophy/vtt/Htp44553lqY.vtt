1
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:04.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very old picture.</v>

2
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.590
<v Speaker 1>It's Jonah emerging from the whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a variant of a myth.</v>

3
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>The Myth is the dragon myth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the Dragon Myth is that </v>

4
00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:22.531
<v Speaker 1>there's a dragon that lives under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground that's eternal and now and then </v>

5
00:00:23.831 --> 00:00:28.831
<v Speaker 1>it rises out of the ground to threaten </v>
<v Speaker 1>the state and someone within the state </v>

6
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>determines to go confront the dragon </v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily and does so and then brings </v>

7
00:00:37.091 --> 00:00:42.091
<v Speaker 1>back something of great value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes if the hero is generally male,</v>

8
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the thing of great value is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>female that the dragon has kidnapped.</v>

9
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.840
<v Speaker 1>That's a St George Story and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gold and other treasured like in </v>

10
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.930
<v Speaker 1>the story of the Hobbit and</v>

11
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.570
<v Speaker 1>story that you all know very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a classic hero story and the Hero's</v>

12
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 1>story is another fundamental element of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the clinical theories.</v>

13
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:11.991
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's predicated on the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you learn through voluntary contact</v>

14
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 1>with that that frightens or disgusts </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

15
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 1>and now it's a hallmark of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic theory.</v>

16
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Young Carl young who will discuss in </v>
<v Speaker 1>detail said his primary dictum was in </v>

17
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.580
<v Speaker 1>steer Colinas invented tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure I massacring because it's</v>

18
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it meant infill.</v>

19
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.120
<v Speaker 1>That will be found and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallmarks of the clinical theories is </v>

20
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.121
<v Speaker 1>that within the confines of everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and you can think about this </v>

21
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 1>as experience out in the world or </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience in the unconscious mind,</v>

22
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.400
<v Speaker 1>there are dirty little secrets let's </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

23
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.310
<v Speaker 1>and skeletons and</v>

24
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>dreadful old fears and remnants of abuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>and memories of pathological behavior </v>

25
00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:11.761
<v Speaker 1>and failures of courage that you leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>you undeveloped perhaps out of avoidance</v>

26
00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:19.111
<v Speaker 1>and that the psychoanalytic process is </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely the careful encounter with </v>

27
00:02:21.671 --> 00:02:26.671
<v Speaker 1>those forgotten and and repressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of the self in the hope that a </v>

28
00:02:29.021 --> 00:02:34.021
<v Speaker 1>clear encounter will redeem them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unite them with the remainder of your </v>

29
00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:39.220
<v Speaker 1>personality and make you make you </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger in consequence,</v>

30
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>and I would say that that's just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>variant of the manner in which human </v>

31
00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.511
<v Speaker 1>beings learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll talk about this more in </v>

32
00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:50.620
<v Speaker 1>relationship to piaget because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>always learn when you're wrong,</v>

33
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.250
<v Speaker 1>which is very annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

34
00:02:54.251 --> 00:02:56.020
<v Speaker 1>what do you learn when you're correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

35
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.510
<v Speaker 1>you're walking in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're operating in the world,</v>

36
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>you have a sense of what you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have happen.</v>

37
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.890
<v Speaker 1>You're always looking at the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>through this sense of what you want to </v>

38
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.890
<v Speaker 1>have happen.</v>

39
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>You're acting so that what you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have happen will happen,</v>

40
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 1>and when it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you're happy because,</v>

41
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

42
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>you get what you want and that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe depending on what you want,</v>

43
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's also good because if you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want when you act,</v>

44
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>then it turns out that your model of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to act is valid right now.</v>

45
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:33.301
<v Speaker 1>Outcome that you get what you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicates no error on the part of your </v>

46
00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:38.071
<v Speaker 1>model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very frequently the case that </v>

47
00:03:38.071 --> 00:03:42.240
<v Speaker 1>when you act to get what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get what you want and then </v>

48
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>that's unpleasant because you don't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want,</v>

49
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's even more unpleasant because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>brings with it the hint of a suggestion </v>

50
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.230
<v Speaker 1>that the manner in which you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>construing the world is incorrect at </v>

51
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 1>some indeterminant level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

52
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 1>if you tell a party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell a joke at a party,</v>

53
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Speaker 1>you presume that people will attend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when they hear the joke,</v>

54
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.290
<v Speaker 1>they will laugh and then if you tell the</v>
<v Speaker 1>joke and it goes flat or even worse,</v>

55
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>disgusts and offends people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be taken aback.</v>

56
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly because you didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want and that's not so good,</v>

57
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:27.541
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's more because there's something </v>

58
00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 1>wrong with the way you conceptualize the</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

59
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.110
<v Speaker 1>And then you're faced with a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is the emergence of a </v>

60
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.500
<v Speaker 1>domain of the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

61
00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:37.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of mistake did you make?</v>

62
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're not as funny as you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

63
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That can be a big problem.</v>

64
00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're not around people that who </v>

65
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.090
<v Speaker 1>are the way you think they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't like you as much as you</v>

66
00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 1>thought they liked you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

67
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.310
<v Speaker 1>the potential for various paranoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts of increasing severity to come </v>

68
00:04:56.981 --> 00:05:00.510
<v Speaker 1>welling up at you in a situation where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you make a,</v>

69
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.490
<v Speaker 1>even a trivial social mistake is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>broad.</v>

70
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.100
<v Speaker 1>And when you make an error of that sort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to face it and sort through all</v>

71
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:14.101
<v Speaker 1>the possibilities so that you can find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what it was that you did wrong and </v>

72
00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>how to retool it so that in the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't make the same mistake and that</v>

73
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:24.091
<v Speaker 1>requires well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that requires in some sense what you </v>

74
00:05:24.091 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>might describe as a journey into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>belly of the beast.</v>

75
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.850
<v Speaker 1>The beast being that place where things </v>
<v Speaker 1>have fallen apart and where you're </v>

76
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.530
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmed with negative emotion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos and confusion.</v>

77
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:37.531
<v Speaker 1>And now it's a very old story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of the journey to the </v>

78
00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:41.131
<v Speaker 1>underworld and the hero is the person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who makes the voluntary journey to the </v>

79
00:05:41.131 --> 00:05:43.750
<v Speaker 1>underworld to collect what's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>languishing down there.</v>

80
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:47.800
<v Speaker 1>And that's the basic motif of </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic theory.</v>

81
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.100
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's the basic motif in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of clinical practice because one </v>

82
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:58.861
<v Speaker 1>of the things that you do as a clinician</v>
<v Speaker 1>is find out what people are afraid of </v>

83
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.900
<v Speaker 1>and what they're avoiding and that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>be in their past or in their present or </v>

84
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.981
<v Speaker 1>in their future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Break it down into smaller pieces and </v>

85
00:06:08.981 --> 00:06:12.320
<v Speaker 1>help them devise strategies of approach </v>
<v Speaker 1>and mastery,</v>

86
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.740
<v Speaker 1>and that improves the quality of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>personality and helps develop them into </v>

87
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 1>people who won't make the same mistakes </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over again.</v>
