1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Young had this idea that people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadows reach all the way down to hell,</v>

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.860
<v Speaker 1>which is a very frightening concept and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he meant by that is is that if you </v>

3
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>take a look at the impulses that drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.630
<v Speaker 1>that are actually malevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can admit to such impulses that </v>

5
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>if you basically follow those all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way down to their origin,</v>

6
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:26.271
<v Speaker 1>you find some very nasty things and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find down there basically as what </v>

7
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:30.350
<v Speaker 1>allies you with people who've done </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible things and that that's not a </v>

8
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:34.980
<v Speaker 1>very pleasant experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

9
00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:39.981
<v Speaker 1>Although one thing that's worth thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about is that it is something that can </v>

10
00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>protect you against being very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very badly hurt.</v>

11
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Because one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterizes people who develop </v>

12
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.481
<v Speaker 1>posttraumatic stress disorder is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're often naive and then they </v>

13
00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:57.771
<v Speaker 1>encounter something that's really not </v>
<v Speaker 1>within their framework of thinking and </v>

14
00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:01.101
<v Speaker 1>it's usually something bad and because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there there isn't anything in their </v>

15
00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:05.211
<v Speaker 1>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their way of looking at the world that </v>

16
00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:05.211
<v Speaker 1>has prepared them for that.</v>

17
00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>They ended up fragmented and devastated </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's actually protective to you.</v>

18
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:14.961
<v Speaker 1>If you can figure out what your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What your full range of capabilities is </v>

19
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.570
<v Speaker 1>because that can help you understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people a lot better and and uh,</v>

20
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.310
<v Speaker 1>to be wiser and more careful in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>

21
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 1>It's also useful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you want to convince yourself</v>

22
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>to act properly because if you regard </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself as harmless,</v>

23
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.340
<v Speaker 1>which is a big mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then nothing you can do is really that </v>

24
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

25
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Because you're harmless after all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you understand that you're </v>

26
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.191
<v Speaker 1>seriously not harmless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that can make you a lot more </v>

27
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:47.400
<v Speaker 1>careful with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that,</v>

28
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>that that's especially true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe when you're dealing,</v>

29
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>when you have kids and you start dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your kids.</v>

30
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 1>If you know that what you're capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're human,</v>

31
00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.940
<v Speaker 1>then that can motivate you to be much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more careful with what you say and do.</v>

32
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.680
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean cautious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean timid.</v>

33
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean any of that.</v>

34
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:10.470
<v Speaker 1>I just mean that you want to keep things</v>
<v Speaker 1>pristine between you and your children,</v>

35
00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:15.471
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that way they're on your good </v>

36
00:02:15.471 --> 00:02:18.111
<v Speaker 1>side and you want them on your good side</v>
<v Speaker 1>because children who get on their </v>

37
00:02:18.111 --> 00:02:22.251
<v Speaker 1>parents bad side suffer very badly for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and sometimes it's because they're </v>

38
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:27.231
<v Speaker 1>literally abused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more often it's because they get </v>

39
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.830
<v Speaker 1>while they get abused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

40
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>or neglected and much more subtle ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're definitely capable of that.</v>

41
00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:38.721
<v Speaker 1>I mean all you have to do is think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that you've interacted with </v>

42
00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:42.081
<v Speaker 1>someone that you've decided to not like </v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe someone you genuinely don't </v>

43
00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:42.081
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

44
00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:44.670
<v Speaker 1>and that can range from just not paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>any attention to them,</v>

45
00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:49.671
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>good to really pursuing them and making </v>

46
00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:53.361
<v Speaker 1>their life miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can certainly do that with your </v>

47
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:53.950
<v Speaker 1>family members and you can do that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>your intimate partner.</v>

48
00:02:53.951 --> 00:02:56.640
<v Speaker 1>So you can do that with your friends and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it with yourself.</v>

49
00:02:56.641 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>And so it's really worth knowing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

50
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Fox thinks he's royal rule breaker,</v>

51
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 1>but he's really just a two bit thug and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where he.</v>

52
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.990
<v Speaker 1>He learns that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sorry,</v>

53
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>I have a new phone and I'm kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid with it still so.</v>

54
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Well hypothetically that'll work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it probably won't.</v>

55
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

56
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.810
<v Speaker 1>the coach ones got these guys in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>grasp now regardless and partly because </v>

57
00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:38.631
<v Speaker 1>they're already down this road and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't back off and partly because he </v>

58
00:03:38.631 --> 00:03:41.781
<v Speaker 1>also offers them more money than they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen before and so as bad as they are,</v>

59
00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:45.060
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of you I presume have seen breaking</v>

60
00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:48.150
<v Speaker 1>bad and that's a really good example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

61
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.350
<v Speaker 1>of the incorporation at least in part or</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the possession by the shadow from </v>

62
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.960
<v Speaker 1>the Union perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

63
00:03:54.961 --> 00:03:59.961
<v Speaker 1>Because you have this ordinary high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school teacher who really thinks that </v>

64
00:03:59.961 --> 00:04:01.530
<v Speaker 1>he's an ax and his family as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

65
00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:04.680
<v Speaker 1>like your typical persona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking,</v>

66
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.860
<v Speaker 1>he's just a normal guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but part of the reason that he's a </v>

67
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.281
<v Speaker 1>normal guy is because he actually hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>been put in abnormal circumstances and </v>

68
00:04:13.281 --> 00:04:14.730
<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden he is and he has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine moral conundrum.</v>

69
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to die of lung cancer and </v>

70
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.920
<v Speaker 1>his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has a son who's got a lot of health </v>

71
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.831
<v Speaker 1>problems and he's terrified that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to leave his wife and his </v>

72
00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:28.980
<v Speaker 1>child behind with nothing and then of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course as the story and so he decides to</v>

73
00:04:28.981 --> 00:04:33.981
<v Speaker 1>do something that temporarily that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>regards as what they would normally </v>

74
00:04:33.981 --> 00:04:36.930
<v Speaker 1>regard as reprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course he just gets tangled up in</v>

75
00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:38.880
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then as the story unfolds,</v>

76
00:04:38.881 --> 00:04:43.881
<v Speaker 1>you see that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more complicated because it's not </v>

77
00:04:43.881 --> 00:04:45.330
<v Speaker 1>that he was just innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good guy and he decided to turn bad.</v>

78
00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:50.331
<v Speaker 1>He's also very resentful and angry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's partly because he's a bit of a </v>

79
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:52.050
<v Speaker 1>pushover at the beginning or maybe more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a bit of a pushover,</v>

80
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.010
<v Speaker 1>and also that he didn't really fulfill </v>
<v Speaker 1>his own potential and that,</v>

81
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

82
00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 1>he had friends who walked down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial path and maybe they </v>

83
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.890
<v Speaker 1>weren't quite fair to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever,</v>

84
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.060
<v Speaker 1>he ends up not very successful as a high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school teacher.</v>

85
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 1>So he's really angry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's more motivation for him </v>

86
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.360
<v Speaker 1>opening up the door to the terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of his personality than just </v>

87
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.700
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he's got good motivations </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do so and that,</v>

88
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>that unfolds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:25.590
<v Speaker 1>and so you see that warps and twists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>is resentful.</v>

90
00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Character increasingly manifest </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves as he walks down this road to</v>

91
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.150
<v Speaker 1>really total brutality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

92
00:05:32.151 --> 00:05:32.780
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

93
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:33.930
<v Speaker 1>it's quite good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

94
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.830
<v Speaker 1>there's a book called ordinary men </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot like that.</v>

95
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've mentioned that to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

96
00:05:40.171 --> 00:05:43.500
<v Speaker 1>but ordinary men is a book about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the best book of it's type.</v>

97
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the only book of its type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible,</v>

98
00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:49.890
<v Speaker 1>but it's plotted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much like breaking bad in some sense.</v>

99
00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:54.891
<v Speaker 1>It's a story about these German </v>
<v Speaker 1>policemen in early stages of World War </v>

100
00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:01.170
<v Speaker 1>II and they were guys who were old </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to be raised in Germany really </v>

101
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 1>before the hitlarian propaganda came out</v>
<v Speaker 1>in full force,</v>

102
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were a teenager,</v>

103
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:07.790
<v Speaker 1>say in the 1930,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you are going to be pulled right into</v>

104
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:12.791
<v Speaker 1>the propaganda machine and maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were part of the Hitler youth and like </v>

105
00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:12.791
<v Speaker 1>you were raised in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:06:12.791 --> 00:06:17.410
<v Speaker 1>but if you were older than you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>raised before that and you're not as </v>

107
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.040
<v Speaker 1>amenable to propaganda once you're older</v>
<v Speaker 1>than about.</v>

108
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.310
<v Speaker 1>While I would say about 22 or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

109
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.140
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty young actually.</v>

110
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.470
<v Speaker 1>If you're gonna make a soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to get a soldier young because </v>

111
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 1>once people are in their early twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say they're kind of.</v>

112
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 1>They already have their personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>

113
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These policemen were sent into Poland </v>

114
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 1>after the Germans marched through and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

115
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was wartime and there is this </v>

116
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis in Germany that the Jews in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

117
00:06:46.911 --> 00:06:51.911
<v Speaker 1>we're operating as a fifth column and </v>
<v Speaker 1>undermining the German war effort </v>

118
00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:55.031
<v Speaker 1>because of course the Germans blamed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews and a variety of other people for </v>

119
00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:57.110
<v Speaker 1>actually setting up the conditions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>made the war necessary.</v>

120
00:06:57.111 --> 00:06:59.120
<v Speaker 1>And so when the police were sent into </v>
<v Speaker 1>Poland,</v>

121
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 1>they were also required to make peace </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

122
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:08.171
<v Speaker 1>And so they started up by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started out by rounding up all the </v>

123
00:07:08.171 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Jewish men between 18 and 65 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gathering them in,</v>

124
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.640
<v Speaker 1>in stadiums and then shipping them off </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the trains.</v>

125
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.910
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't where they ended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ended in a very,</v>

126
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:18.260
<v Speaker 1>very dark place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

127
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:23.261
<v Speaker 1>these guys were going out in the field </v>
<v Speaker 1>with naked pregnant women and shooting </v>

128
00:07:23.261 --> 00:07:24.440
<v Speaker 1>them in the back of the head by the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their training.</v>

129
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.830
<v Speaker 1>And what's really interesting about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that is that their commander told him</v>

130
00:07:30.681 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 1>that they could go home at any time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>

131
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.070
<v Speaker 1>this is not one of those examples of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people following orders.</v>

132
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.400
<v Speaker 1>And the reason they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

133
00:07:40.401 --> 00:07:45.401
<v Speaker 1>there's many reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the reasons they didn't is </v>

134
00:07:45.401 --> 00:07:45.401
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't think it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>comradely,</v>

135
00:07:45.401 --> 00:07:47.110
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to leave their,</v>

136
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.190
<v Speaker 1>the guys they were working with to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the dirty work and run off now.</v>

137
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.840
<v Speaker 1>And that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really an interesting fact,</v>

138
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:55.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'd in,</v>

139
00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:00.270
<v Speaker 1>in different circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't think about that as </v>

140
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.270
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

141
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.360
<v Speaker 1>You'd think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's part of teamwork and on your</v>

142
00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:07.361
<v Speaker 1>rough circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's at least in part how they </v>

143
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:10.091
<v Speaker 1>viewed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were also made physically ill </v>

144
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:12.760
<v Speaker 1>multiple times physically and </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically ill by the things that </v>

145
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.490
<v Speaker 1>they had to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they kept doing them anyways.</v>

146
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:19.210
<v Speaker 1>So it's one step at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing is that you end up </v>

147
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.340
<v Speaker 1>in very bad places one step at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've gotta watch those steps.</v>
