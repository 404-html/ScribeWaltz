1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.530
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time the child is old enough to </v>

2
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.621
<v Speaker 1>be launched out into the social world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all the constraints that are </v>

3
00:00:08.621 --> 00:00:10.970
<v Speaker 1>associated with the playground are </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately placed on that child.</v>

4
00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:13.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very unforgiving landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.400
<v Speaker 1>Because the last thing a child wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>really the last thing that child wants </v>

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.031
<v Speaker 1>is not to have any friends or even </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps equally seriously not to have a </v>

7
00:00:22.311 --> 00:00:23.710
<v Speaker 1>best friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

8
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Not read something so idiotic the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>day that I couldn't believe it.</v>

9
00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:31.370
<v Speaker 1>So the newest prince,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Queen Elizabeth's,</v>

10
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.460
<v Speaker 1>I guess great grandchild is off to </v>
<v Speaker 1>daycare and in the UK and in this </v>

11
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.691
<v Speaker 1>daycare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't let the kids have best </v>

12
00:00:40.691 --> 00:00:40.960
<v Speaker 1>friends because that's unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought no</v>

13
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.110
<v Speaker 1>something times you see something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so stupid you can't even believe it.</v>

14
00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:46.350
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

15
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.470
<v Speaker 1>it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was one of those examples </v>

16
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.470
<v Speaker 1>because it's been known for quite a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

17
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.390
<v Speaker 1>that one of the developmental milestones</v>
<v Speaker 1>that children attain somewhere between </v>

18
00:00:57.451 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>say the age of five and 10 is they pick </v>
<v Speaker 1>a best friend.</v>

19
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.560
<v Speaker 1>And so they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

20
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>and you know the hypothesis well that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfair to all the other children.</v>

21
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:07.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

22
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be the best friend to everyone</v>

23
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>because you then maybe there is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion children,</v>

24
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:17.271
<v Speaker 1>so each of them gets one second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's just not a very deep </v>

25
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:20.211
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the idea that you can be equally </v>

26
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>friendly with everyone is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>preposterous,</v>

27
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:23.790
<v Speaker 1>but even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is the thing that the child is</v>

28
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:28.791
<v Speaker 1>doing is actually becoming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're stepping out of their </v>

29
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>egocentricity because they're best </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends becomes more important than they</v>

30
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:36.621
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a precursor for adult </v>

31
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:36.621
<v Speaker 1>relationships where you know if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>married,</v>

32
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:39.420
<v Speaker 1>while your partner should be at least as</v>
<v Speaker 1>important as you are,</v>

33
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:41.310
<v Speaker 1>and the relationship should be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

34
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.460
<v Speaker 1>But then when you have children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're more important than </v>

35
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.710
<v Speaker 1>you that that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unless there's something wrong with</v>

36
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:48.610
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come second in.</v>

37
00:01:48.611 --> 00:01:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Your children come first and they're way</v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

38
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.730
<v Speaker 1>They're not just a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're necessary because without </v>

39
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.730
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to manage,</v>

40
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>so you have to take care of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not number one anymore.</v>

41
00:01:57.331 --> 00:02:02.331
<v Speaker 1>Once you have kids and less seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you didn't learn the lessons in </v>

42
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>the playground and when you have a best </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend,</v>

43
00:02:03.211 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>you're not number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are and so,</v>

44
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.290
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are these constraints that emerge </v>

45
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.290
<v Speaker 1>in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the social landscape,</v>

46
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.550
<v Speaker 1>you have to have friends and also you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to single someone out as </v>

47
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.450
<v Speaker 1>particularly unique among those friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>and establish a genuinely reciprocal and</v>

48
00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:25.491
<v Speaker 1>caring relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the psychiatrist who </v>

49
00:02:25.491 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>studied this so intently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

50
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.030
<v Speaker 1>he was the first person to to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>detailed analysis of the best friend </v>

51
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>relationships that children established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

52
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.390
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to give him credit for his </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

53
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:40.190
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately I can't remember his </v>
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>

54
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.420
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
