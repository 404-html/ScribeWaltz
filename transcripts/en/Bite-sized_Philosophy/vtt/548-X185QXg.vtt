1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.570
<v Speaker 1>I want to come back also to what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were saying about the predictive power </v>

3
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.061
<v Speaker 1>of Iq and conscientiousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I don't dispute that I'm also not </v>

4
00:00:10.061 --> 00:00:14.351
<v Speaker 1>one of these people who suffers under </v>
<v Speaker 1>the delusion that these things are </v>

5
00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:15.050
<v Speaker 1>totally open quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socially determined,</v>

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.130
<v Speaker 1>closed quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7
00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:21.131
<v Speaker 1>I understand and believe that they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>high heritability and identifiable </v>

8
00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:24.440
<v Speaker 1>genetic sources in that variability and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.110
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the standard old joke used to be,</v>

10
00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:32.111
<v Speaker 1>you can tell because you don't worry </v>
<v Speaker 1>about personality psychology that I do </v>

11
00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:32.111
<v Speaker 1>at the standard old junk used to be that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

12
00:00:32.111 --> 00:00:33.380
<v Speaker 1>everything's 50 percent heritable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

13
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.840
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pretty much anything that you could</v>

14
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.770
<v Speaker 1>measure as a trait that has any </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability within the lifetime also turns</v>

15
00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:42.430
<v Speaker 1>out to have a heritability somewhere to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your point five.</v>

16
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.690
<v Speaker 1>But there's the other point five of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.760
<v Speaker 1>some people have low iqs because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were exposed to too much.</v>

18
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.570
<v Speaker 1>They see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that conscientiousness,</v>

20
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.930
<v Speaker 1>this can probably be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe you suggested earlier that we </v>

21
00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:09.221
<v Speaker 1>know something about this already about </v>
<v Speaker 1>developmental determinative of shifts in</v>

22
00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:11.650
<v Speaker 1>conscientious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

23
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.390
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.490
<v Speaker 1>we have to caution ourselves against </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about these individual </v>

25
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.020
<v Speaker 1>difference factors as if they are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful attributes of individuals that</v>

26
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:26.021
<v Speaker 1>are going to undermine Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of progressive improvement of,</v>

27
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.180
<v Speaker 1>of circumstances for people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

28
00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

29
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.790
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to create bad byproducts of </v>

30
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.980
<v Speaker 1>attempts to produce social justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just gonna you know,</v>

31
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.540
<v Speaker 1>you're going to leave your country and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just people out there being parasites or</v>

32
00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:41.900
<v Speaker 1>something</v>

33
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.370
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is of course decent evidence that </v>

34
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.730
<v Speaker 2>there's cultural effects on Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the flynn effect,</v>

35
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 2>which is named after the man who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who described the,</v>

36
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

37
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.760
<v Speaker 2>the phenomena indicates that the average</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iq has been increasing quite </v>

38
00:02:02.051 --> 00:02:03.850
<v Speaker 2>substantially over the last hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

39
00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:07.270
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one knows for sure,</v>

40
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 2>but one of the putative reasons for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that we've lifted the bottom out of </v>

41
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.400
<v Speaker 2>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there aren't people whose Iq is,</v>

42
00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:20.401
<v Speaker 2>are stunted by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by exposure to zero information during </v>

43
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.560
<v Speaker 2>critical developmental periods and who </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't get enough to eat.</v>

44
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say superior about </v>

45
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.140
<v Speaker 1>nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody probation.</v>

46
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

47
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

48
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've,</v>

49
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.580
<v Speaker 2>we've wiped out in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've wiped out the worst effects of </v>

50
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.660
<v Speaker 2>privation and that's increasingly true </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well on,</v>

51
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.710
<v Speaker 2>on the worldwide scale worldwide stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know there's about 150,000</v>

52
00:02:44.321 --> 00:02:48.910
<v Speaker 2>people a day right now being lifted out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of absolute poverty by UN standards,</v>

53
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 2>the fastest improvement in the history </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world by a huge margin and also </v>

54
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.751
<v Speaker 2>about 300,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people a day being hooked up to the </v>

55
00:02:57.751 --> 00:02:58.690
<v Speaker 2>electrical grid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we are making some progress,</v>

56
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 2>removing the absolute privation problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a nontrivial problem.</v>

57
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.970
<v Speaker 2>The problem with most of the attempts to</v>
<v Speaker 2>raise Iq is that they don't change the </v>

58
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 2>variance in Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tend to raise the average Iq across</v>

59
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:16.711
<v Speaker 2>the population and that leaves the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inequality of Iq inequality problem </v>

60
00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:21.481
<v Speaker 2>basically untouched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there have been studies trying to </v>

61
00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 2>estimate how much socioeconomic </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure,</v>

62
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.010
<v Speaker 2>let's say you have to place on an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual to raise their iq lowering.</v>

63
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.600
<v Speaker 2>It's easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

64
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Because making something worse is always</v>
<v Speaker 2>easier than making something better.</v>

65
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.440
<v Speaker 2>But if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take a,</v>

66
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.690
<v Speaker 2>an identical twin who's adopted out at </v>
<v Speaker 2>birth in order to produce a 15 point </v>

67
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 2>increase in Iq compared to the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>twin,</v>

68
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.360
<v Speaker 2>which is a one standard deviation </v>
<v Speaker 2>increase and about the same as the </v>

69
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.280
<v Speaker 2>average difference between a university </v>
<v Speaker 2>student in a,</v>

70
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 2>in an average state college and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>average high school student,</v>

71
00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.620
<v Speaker 2>you have to move the one twin from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fifth percentile of socioeconomic status</v>

72
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:07.111
<v Speaker 2>to the 95th percentile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need about a three standard </v>

73
00:04:07.111 --> 00:04:10.981
<v Speaker 2>deviation improvement and socioeconomic </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions to produce a one standard </v>

74
00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 2>deviation improvement in Icu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it looks like it can be done,</v>

75
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:16.000
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's expensive,</v>

76
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

77
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.740
<v Speaker 1>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>

78
00:04:18.741 --> 00:04:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of surprised I'm actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been given,</v>

79
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just mentioned malnutrition as one </v>

80
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.700
<v Speaker 1>possible source of low Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What possible developmental source.</v>

81
00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:30.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm Kinda surprised that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.600
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that the flit effect might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be due to things like,</v>

83
00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:36.590
<v Speaker 1>or reduction of the number of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed to severe malnutrition,</v>

84
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 1>that it wouldn't have also </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously truncated the variance a </v>

85
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.310
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems like they said,</v>

86
00:04:43.311 --> 00:04:43.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

87
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.180
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me restate that.</v>

88
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 2>It has truncated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has truncated the variance,</v>

89
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:52.510
<v Speaker 2>although the data on that isn't clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't as clear,</v>

90
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:53.740
<v Speaker 2>but so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

91
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.890
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do believe that it's a reasonable </v>

92
00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.890
<v Speaker 2>inference to make that the variance has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been truncated.</v>

93
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.911
<v Speaker 2>It's also hidden to some degree because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Iq tests are always renewed them to </v>

94
00:05:02.911 --> 00:05:05.100
<v Speaker 2>keep the variance out of standard 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>points so.</v>

95
00:05:05.101 --> 00:05:10.101
<v Speaker 2>So it makes it difficult to look </v>
<v Speaker 2>retrospectively and see what's happened </v>

96
00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 2>to the variance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by the time,</v>

97
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.900
<v Speaker 2>the other problem too is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

98
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:18.901
<v Speaker 2>you get these stories now and then about</v>
<v Speaker 2>these companies that come out with the </v>

99
00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:21.130
<v Speaker 2>claims that their brain exercises can </v>
<v Speaker 2>improve Iq and the literature on that is</v>

100
00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:26.131
<v Speaker 2>damn dismal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you it's that the holy grail </v>

101
00:05:26.131 --> 00:05:29.371
<v Speaker 2>is to produce cognitive exercises that </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce a legitimate impact on fluid </v>

102
00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.960
<v Speaker 2>intelligence and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like there's been a lot of work done</v>

103
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 2>on that and the answer is so far is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work.</v>

104
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about like video gaming?</v>

105
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there has been this suggestion </v>

106
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.151
<v Speaker 1>that playing video games actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>improves at least some aspects of </v>

107
00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:49.321
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple of studies that </v>

108
00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:49.321
<v Speaker 1>indicated that video games might improve</v>
<v Speaker 1>spatial intelligence,</v>

109
00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:49.820
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's</v>

110
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 2>problem and I think this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a critical problem or perhaps an</v>

111
00:05:55.191 --> 00:06:00.191
<v Speaker 2>insoluble one or at least no one's </v>
<v Speaker 2>solved is that what you get is that if </v>

112
00:06:00.191 --> 00:06:03.971
<v Speaker 2>you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you exercise yourself substantially </v>

113
00:06:03.971 --> 00:06:06.821
<v Speaker 2>on a given game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can radically accelerate your </v>

114
00:06:06.821 --> 00:06:09.041
<v Speaker 2>performance in the game so you can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>much better at those specific skill </v>

115
00:06:09.041 --> 00:06:12.581
<v Speaker 2>share,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't get generalization across </v>

116
00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:12.820
<v Speaker 2>cognitive sets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what you're really hoping for.</v>

117
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.070
<v Speaker 2>Because I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was the claim for some.</v>

118
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.410
<v Speaker 2>They have shown some increases in </v>
<v Speaker 2>spatial Iq,</v>

119
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:22.400
<v Speaker 2>but there's not very many studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say they're far overbalanced</v>

120
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.640
<v Speaker 2>by the other side of the research </v>
<v Speaker 2>equation,</v>

121
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:30.641
<v Speaker 2>which continually says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've looked at this because I'm </v>

122
00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 2>really interested in the improvement of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ICU.</v>

123
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

124
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 2>that's the holy grail in some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

125
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

126
00:06:35.841 --> 00:06:37.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

127
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.700
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overwhelming preponderance of </v>

128
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.311
<v Speaker 2>evidence suggests that you don't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>generalization outside the narrow </v>

129
00:06:45.311 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 2>domain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now why that is,</v>

130
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:51.100
<v Speaker 2>and even this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's even worse say because you might </v>

131
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.100
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

132
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.130
<v Speaker 2>imagine that you could take five </v>
<v Speaker 2>different domains of intelligence still </v>

133
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 2>associated type with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Jay,</v>

134
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:59.960
<v Speaker 2>and you had people practice routines in </v>
<v Speaker 2>all five dimensions.</v>

135
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you'd get generalization under </v>
<v Speaker 2>those circumstances.</v>

136
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:04.080
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

137
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:09.310
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the results of the research attempting </v>

138
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.681
<v Speaker 2>that indicate that no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as you move away from those </v>

139
00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:12.560
<v Speaker 2>specific practice instances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't get generalization.</v>
