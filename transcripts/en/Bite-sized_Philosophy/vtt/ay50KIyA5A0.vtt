00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

2
00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:05.820
<v Speaker 1>back to the equity thing of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>postures and idiotic ideas.</v>

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.300
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make gender equity across every </v>

4
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>dimension of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>

5
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.030
<v Speaker 1>of an organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to assume that men and women </v>

6
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 1>have identical interests or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

7
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>and temperaments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that if they don't,</v>

8
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:23.280
<v Speaker 1>the state should intervene to bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>well ensure that they do,</v>

9
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 1>which is something for all you women to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out because now there's many,</v>

10
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many what a positions in society that </v>

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.790
<v Speaker 1>women preferentially occupied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are you going to do about that </v>

12
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.420
<v Speaker 1>and what are you going to do about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asians because they occupied </v>

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>preferential positions as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

14
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.570
<v Speaker 1>they're overrepresented in all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional institutions and the </v>

15
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.190
<v Speaker 1>probability is that that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase.</v>

16
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.490
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about the Jews are going to do </v>

17
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.251
<v Speaker 1>about them because they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in the same position as they </v>

18
00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Asians going to put quotas on all those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

19
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>What kind of stupidity is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's worse too,</v>

20
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:04.491
<v Speaker 1>because let's say you equalize women and</v>
<v Speaker 1>accrued for just for the sake of </v>

21
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:06.030
<v Speaker 1>argument across all these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions of society.</v>

22
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Well then what are you going to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to,</v>

23
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>are you going to equalize for black </v>
<v Speaker 1>women and Latino Women and Asian women?</v>

24
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to sub type black women </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not like they're all the </v>

25
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.171
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to ensure that women from </v>

26
00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:24.471
<v Speaker 1>lower classes are are represented just </v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as women from upper classes and </v>

27
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>how many generations back are you going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go to check that?</v>

28
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.730
<v Speaker 1>What about intelligence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about attractiveness?</v>

29
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.890
<v Speaker 1>How about height?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about weight?</v>

30
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.320
<v Speaker 1>So the problem with the fractionation by</v>
<v Speaker 1>group identity is that it's endless.</v>

31
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.710
<v Speaker 1>There's no way of ensuring equality </v>
<v Speaker 1>across groups because there's an </v>

32
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of groups you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>fragment group identity all the way down</v>

33
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:47.370
<v Speaker 1>into the level of the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what you should do.</v>

34
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Which is what we already did in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>West.</v>

35
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 1>We figured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

36
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate diverse population is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>population of individuals.</v>

37
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>So you let the individuals sorted out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

38
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:58.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to replace that with group.</v>

39
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means for the bloody social </v>

40
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.051
<v Speaker 1>activists is that they'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play this game forever because you can </v>

41
00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:09.291
<v Speaker 1>continually fractioning group identity </v>
<v Speaker 1>ad nauseum and so the system will never </v>

42
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:13.671
<v Speaker 1>be equal and you can bloody well be sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as we implement social policy to </v>

43
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:19.011
<v Speaker 1>make sure that all outcomes are equal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the amount of space that you </v>

44
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:22.341
<v Speaker 1>personally are going to have to maneuver</v>
<v Speaker 1>in is going to shrink and shrink and </v>

45
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:25.881
<v Speaker 1>shrink and shrink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've already seen that happen in many </v>

46
00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:28.551
<v Speaker 1>societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think we would learn from the 20th </v>

47
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:28.551
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
