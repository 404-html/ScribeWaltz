1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're always in one of these little </v>

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.450
<v Speaker 1>frameworks and there's just no getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of it.</v>

3
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because you know,</v>

4
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.850
<v Speaker 1>at any given moment this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like field theory.</v>

5
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:13.851
<v Speaker 1>There used to be psychological theories </v>
<v Speaker 1>that talked about the field of human </v>

6
00:00:13.851 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

7
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:19.011
<v Speaker 1>And this is kind of what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a field and basically what </v>

8
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:22.971
<v Speaker 1>happens is you parse out a little part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world say and so an amount you </v>

9
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:27.230
<v Speaker 1>can handle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say it has some duration.</v>

10
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>You're not aiming at something 50 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>

11
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>It's because how the hell are you going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that?</v>

12
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.350
<v Speaker 1>There's too many variables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.580
<v Speaker 1>so you're aiming at some handleable </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of time and you,</v>

14
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 1>it a goal in there and you plot your </v>
<v Speaker 1>route and then that tells you what's up </v>

15
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.390
<v Speaker 1>and tells you what's down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

16
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.700
<v Speaker 1>moves you towards the goal and down </v>
<v Speaker 1>moves you away from the goal and that </v>

17
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.050
<v Speaker 1>sets up your motivational framework so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have some worth attaining.</v>

18
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really interesting thing to </v>

19
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.200
<v Speaker 1>know too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like why have a goal ball?</v>

20
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>It's easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no goal,</v>

21
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.040
<v Speaker 1>no positive emotion because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced positive emotion by noticing</v>

22
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:09.471
<v Speaker 1>that you're moving towards a goal and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have to have a goal while </v>

23
00:01:09.471 --> 00:01:12.210
<v Speaker 1>you can't have any positive emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so better have a goal,</v>

24
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.950
<v Speaker 1>and so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

25
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>what should the goal be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>we could start by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

27
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>any goal is better than none,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we might say,</v>

28
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:25.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be a goal that other people </v>

29
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:27.170
<v Speaker 1>will let you pursue because otherwise </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be kind of difficult and </v>

30
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe there'll be even happy to help you</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue it.</v>

31
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.440
<v Speaker 1>That would even be better and maybe it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a goal that would enable you to learn </v>

32
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>how to pursue other goals while you </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue that goal.</v>

33
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would really be good,</v>

34
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.950
<v Speaker 1>and so you can see that your goal is </v>
<v Speaker 1>parameterized,</v>

35
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.650
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that any old goal </v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

36
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 1>It means there's some goals that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicely and some not so nicely.</v>

37
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:49.770
<v Speaker 1>There are playable games and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>unplayable games.</v>

38
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want to have a playable game and</v>

39
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:55.440
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lawyer,</v>

40
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>plumber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

42
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.750
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're playable games and,</v>

43
00:02:01.751 --> 00:02:06.751
<v Speaker 1>and it's not obvious which ones better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly obvious which ones </v>

44
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:10.971
<v Speaker 1>are sustainable and which ones are worse</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's a set of playable games </v>

45
00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 1>and you need to extract from that set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>playable games,</v>

46
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.980
<v Speaker 1>a game that suits you and that would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly due to your temperament,</v>

47
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:21.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because extroverted people want to play </v>

48
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:24.021
<v Speaker 1>an extroverted game and highly neurotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to play a safe game and </v>

49
00:02:24.021 --> 00:02:28.280
<v Speaker 1>agreeable people want to play a generous</v>
<v Speaker 1>game and disagreeable people wanting to </v>

50
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>play a game that's highly competitive so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can win and you know,</v>

51
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.410
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're all within the realm of </v>

52
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>playable games and that means they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>socially acceptable as well.</v>

53
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>And so that means it isn't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary,</v>

54
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.500
<v Speaker 1>it isn't just relative what you decide </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

55
00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:48.870
<v Speaker 1>It's heavily parameterized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only,</v>

56
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>there's a set of playable games and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>large.</v>

57
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:54.220
<v Speaker 1>The set is large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

58
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.290
<v Speaker 1>there are commonalities within it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why there are commonalities.</v>

59
00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 1>That's why morality has a common basis </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

60
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:04.670
<v Speaker 1>And so that's partly what we're trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to investigate is like,</v>

61
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

62
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there such a thing?</v>

63
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing to remember is that if you </v>

64
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>don't direct a hierarchical structure </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a someday,</v>

65
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got no positive motivation because </v>

66
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>you experience positive motivation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to a goal,</v>

67
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>not from attaining the goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that satisfaction,</v>

68
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 1>and besides it's fleeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know perfectly well,</v>

69
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 1>you graduate from university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poof,</v>

70
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 1>next day you have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what do you do next?</v>

71
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a tough problem.</v>

72
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you've solved your </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems by winning that game,</v>

73
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 1>you just introduced the problem of </v>
<v Speaker 1>having to introduce another game.</v>

74
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>So it's unreliable as a source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive emotion.</v>

75
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 1>But what's reliable is you set a goal </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you try to attain it.</v>

76
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.510
<v Speaker 1>And then that gives your life that </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally provides your life with </v>

77
00:03:57.551 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 1>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what meaning is.</v>

78
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Now it's more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what it is.</v>

79
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

80
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.110
<v Speaker 1>what's a really good goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

81
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're trying to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a really good goal.</v>
