1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.400
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to answer where do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall short in these 12 rules?</v>

2
00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Is it a cost constant adjustment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.470
<v Speaker 1>I wrote these rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you mean?</v>

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Why did I write these rules?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.350
<v Speaker 1>and especially when I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7
00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:23.351
<v Speaker 1>you should try to improve yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of trying to set the world </v>

8
00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:23.870
<v Speaker 1>straight or instead of worrying about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what other people are doing wrong,</v>

9
00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:28.871
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a hell of a thing for </v>

10
00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:30.251
<v Speaker 1>someone to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just wrote a book called 12 rules </v>

11
00:00:30.251 --> 00:00:30.251
<v Speaker 1>for lights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

12
00:00:30.251 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is is that I wasn't just </v>

13
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.720
<v Speaker 1>writing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading that for me as much as for</v>

14
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:39.410
<v Speaker 1>anyone else and I mean that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really mean that sincerely.</v>

15
00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:44.411
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had an opportunity to spend somewhere </v>

16
00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:47.291
<v Speaker 1>around five years meditating on how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should conduct yourself so that your </v>

17
00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:50.660
<v Speaker 1>life is what it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I'm in the group of people that</v>

18
00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm advising you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

19
00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:57.461
<v Speaker 1>It's like all of these things are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to stand up straight to </v>

20
00:00:57.461 --> 00:01:00.851
<v Speaker 1>remember that and to treat yourself like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're someone worthwhile and to make </v>

21
00:01:00.851 --> 00:01:04.640
<v Speaker 1>friends with people who are good for you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to tell the truth or at least not to</v>

22
00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:04.970
<v Speaker 1>lie.</v>

23
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are all ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

24
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.610
<v Speaker 1>and especially taken as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They constituted a kind of ideal and you</v>

25
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never.</v>

26
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.410
<v Speaker 1>You never attained the ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eye,</v>

27
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.760
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it recedes as you approach it,</v>

28
00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:21.761
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you straighten yourself out and </v>

29
00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:21.761
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

30
00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:21.761
<v Speaker 1>I've got it now and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

31
00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:21.761
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more to gold.</v>

32
00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:24.320
<v Speaker 1>There's still more to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you get that much farther along</v>

33
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:25.250
<v Speaker 1>the line you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>

34
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.650
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought this was the end of the road.</v>

35
00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:28.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

36
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.300
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of imperfections left to </v>
<v Speaker 1>iron out,</v>

37
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.330
<v Speaker 1>and so it is a constant adjustment and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's something about that that's </v>

38
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.231
<v Speaker 1>also positive because you might say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not so much that there isn't such a</v>

39
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:46.751
<v Speaker 1>thing as a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that our idea of what constitutes </v>

40
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:50.471
<v Speaker 1>good isn't right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a good person is someone who's </v>

41
00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:53.660
<v Speaker 1>trying to get better and no matter how </v>
<v Speaker 1>good you are,</v>

42
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.100
<v Speaker 1>there's better that you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the real goodness is in the attempt,</v>

43
00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in.</v>

44
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.210
<v Speaker 1>It's in the process too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To use somewhat of a Cliche,</v>

45
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

46
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll close with this,</v>

47
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:07.100
<v Speaker 1>and it's a good way to close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

48
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.770
<v Speaker 1>and this is a psychological observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

49
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.130
<v Speaker 1>the central figure of Western culture is</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>

50
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.700
<v Speaker 1>And we can look at that psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Christ is the dying and </v>

51
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.940
<v Speaker 1>resurrected hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what does that mean psychologically?</v>

52
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that</v>

53
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>you've learned things painfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you learn something painfully a</v>

54
00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:34.300
<v Speaker 1>part of you has to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the pain.</v>

55
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a dream is shattered,</v>

56
00:02:36.341 --> 00:02:38.510
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge part of you that,</v>

57
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.570
<v Speaker 1>that constituted that dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe even the biological substrate of </v>

58
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.660
<v Speaker 1>that June has to be stripped away in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>burned.</v>

59
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.680
<v Speaker 1>And so life is a constant process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>death and rebirth.</v>

60
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.850
<v Speaker 1>And to participate in that fully is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow yourself to be redeemed by it.</v>

61
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.950
<v Speaker 1>And so the good is that process of death</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rebirth voluntarily undertaken.</v>

62
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're not as good as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be.</v>

63
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>So he let that part of you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if someone comes along and says,</v>

64
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some deadwood here,</v>

65
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it needs to be burned off.</v>

66
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

67
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>that stuff's still a bit alive when that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burns,</v>

68
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 1>it's going to hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

69
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no kidding.</v>

70
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 1>But maybe the thing that emerges in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>place is something better.</v>

71
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is the secret of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>

72
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 1>This is what we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:35.011
<v Speaker 1>unlike any other creature is that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>let our old selves die and let our new </v>

74
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>selves be bored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we should do.</v>

75
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.830
<v Speaker 1>And so where do I fall short in these 12</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules?</v>

76
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>endlessly because.</v>

77
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a way of thinking about it until </v>

78
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>the entire world is redeemed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all fall short.</v>

79
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's probably a good place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

80
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
