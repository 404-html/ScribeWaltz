1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.600
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at plastic hero mythology,</v>

2
00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:08.601
<v Speaker 1>which we're going to do in great detail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you see is that the typical myth of</v>

3
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:12.480
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of humanity is we live in a place,</v>

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>will say we have to live in a place and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the place is doing quite nicely.</v>

5
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the hobbits and,</v>

6
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.780
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Frodo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Speaker 1>The first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lord that the,</v>

9
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was it called?</v>

10
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>The hobbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hobbit.</v>

11
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:31.821
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got a little shy or they're </v>

12
00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:31.821
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all peaceful.</v>

13
00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:32.940
<v Speaker 1>It's full of these little people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little on the arrogant side.</v>

14
00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:35.640
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of dopey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea what the hell is going</v>

15
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Speaker 1>on in the outside world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they think that's okay.</v>

16
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:38.490
<v Speaker 1>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:40.020
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 1>peculiar people are concerned about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing.</v>

19
00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 1>They got their little happy paradise </v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

20
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.340
<v Speaker 1>They live a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they eat a lot,</v>

21
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they party a lot unbeknownst to them,</v>

22
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>which is very interesting feature of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

23
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>The only reason they have any peace at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

24
00:00:55.681 --> 00:01:00.681
<v Speaker 1>it's because they are descendants of old</v>
<v Speaker 1>kings continually patrolling the </v>

25
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 1>borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

26
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Those are the striders Aragorn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the member of the race of old kings</v>

27
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:08.880
<v Speaker 1>who patrols the borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

28
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>those are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are ancestral figures.</v>

29
00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:13.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can all sit here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your little happy paradise,</v>

30
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 1>but the only reason you can do it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the sons of great kings have put</v>

31
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>borders around your kingdom and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's funny because in the hobbits,</v>

32
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>hobbits basically despise strider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

33
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:28.780
<v Speaker 1>you're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very suspicious of him.</v>

34
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.790
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of dirty and dusty and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like he's been banged around all </v>

35
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started like a trap.</v>

36
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the son of a great king.</v>

37
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Good thing for them that he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however.</v>

38
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:43.521
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then you've got the little shyer and </v>

39
00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>what happens even though things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>stirring and what is it?</v>

40
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally it's a great dragon.</v>

41
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a snake,</v>

42
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:50.760
<v Speaker 1>except it's like medicine snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:50.761 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

44
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.140
<v Speaker 1>it's snake with fire and you can be sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fire was not only one of our </v>

45
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.530
<v Speaker 1>greatest allies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of our greatest enemies,</v>

46
00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:00.930
<v Speaker 1>especially when we lived on the Veltin </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>

47
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.880
<v Speaker 1>because that thing would burn now in </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

48
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so get the hell away from that as </v>

49
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

50
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:12.780
<v Speaker 1>so one hobbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's woken up by a wizard,</v>

51
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.920
<v Speaker 1>the wizard is a symbol of the cell from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the union perspective.</v>

52
00:02:16.921 --> 00:02:21.921
<v Speaker 1>So there's one hobbit who's a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>more creative and exploratory than the </v>

53
00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>rest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody has a level of respect for</v>

54
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:27.651
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they think he's pretty damn </v>

55
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:27.651
<v Speaker 1>peculiar.</v>

56
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>He decides that he's gonna under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tutelage of the wizard.</v>

57
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>He's going to go check out this dragon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he leaves the borders and he goes out</v>

58
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>into the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the rest of it is an adventure.</v>

59
00:02:35.791 --> 00:02:37.800
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting again,</v>

60
00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:42.801
<v Speaker 1>from a union perspective is that what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hobbit have to become in order to </v>

61
00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:46.500
<v Speaker 1>conquer the Dragon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A thief?</v>

62
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Now that's pretty weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a because you think,</v>

63
00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy's out to be a hero,</v>

64
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:51.840
<v Speaker 1>so he should be a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

65
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:54.270
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he turns into a thief.</v>

66
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

67
00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:58.080
<v Speaker 1>it's because if you're going to conquer </v>
<v Speaker 1>a dragon,</v>

68
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>you be a hell of a lot tougher than you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are naive,</v>

69
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.980
<v Speaker 1>and so partly what happens is that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hobbit to muster up the forces that </v>

70
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>are necessary for him to confront </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that that is that fundamental,</v>

71
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>he asked to transcend his towered.</v>

72
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.820
<v Speaker 1>What would you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the cowardice that he describes as </v>

73
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

74
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 1>so need shift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

75
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 1>niche is often viewed as a critic critic</v>
<v Speaker 1>of morality.</v>

76
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

77
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Because nature identifies morality with </v>
<v Speaker 1>cowardice,</v>

78
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What Nisha says is this,</v>

79
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>if you're too afraid to do something so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't do it,</v>

80
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>then you'll say that the reason that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it is because your moral.</v>

81
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.480
<v Speaker 1>That's not the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason is it's you're too damn </v>

82
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.480
<v Speaker 1>afraid to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might want to,</v>

83
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.710
<v Speaker 1>but you're too afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make you moral.</v>

84
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 1>So what happens to the Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

85
00:03:56.351 --> 00:04:01.351
<v Speaker 1>is once he gets outside the kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he asked to develop a whole array of </v>

86
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.720
<v Speaker 1>potentials that he never developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>before because they were either not </v>

87
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.591
<v Speaker 1>necessary in his civilized place or </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were forbidden as immoral </v>

88
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.480
<v Speaker 1>by the cultural situation that he grew </v>
<v Speaker 1>up there.</v>
