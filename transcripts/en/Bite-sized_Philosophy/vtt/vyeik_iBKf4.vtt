1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.670
<v Speaker 1>One of the other things I've learned as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a social scientist,</v>

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.480
<v Speaker 1>and I've been warned about this by I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say great social scientists that </v>

3
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>you want to be very careful about doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>large scale experimentation with large </v>

4
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.711
<v Speaker 1>scale systems because the probability </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you implement a scheme in a </v>

5
00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:27.550
<v Speaker 1>large scale social system that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>scheme will have the result you intended</v>

6
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>is negligible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What will happen will be something that </v>

7
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.620
<v Speaker 1>you don't intend and even worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that works at counter purposes</v>

8
00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:40.621
<v Speaker 1>to your original intent and so and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense because if you have a </v>

9
00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:45.250
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very complex system and you perturb it,</v>

10
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 1>the probability that you can predict the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of the perturbation is </v>

11
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.160
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously if the system works though,</v>

12
00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:58.060
<v Speaker 1>you think you understand it because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>works and so you think it's simpler than</v>

13
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.540
<v Speaker 1>it actually is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then you think that your model of</v>

14
00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:06.541
<v Speaker 1>it is correct and then you think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your manipulation of the model which </v>

15
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:10.951
<v Speaker 1>produces outcome new model will be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outcome that's actually produced in the </v>

16
00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:13.120
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it doesn't work at all.</v>

17
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>I thought about that an awful lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about how to remediate social </v>

18
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.841
<v Speaker 1>systems because obviously they need </v>
<v Speaker 1>careful attention and adjustment and it </v>

19
00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:27.310
<v Speaker 1>struck me that the proper</v>

20
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 1>strategy for implementing social change </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to stay within your domain of </v>

21
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.191
<v Speaker 1>competence and that requires humility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a virtue that is never</v>

22
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.470
<v Speaker 1>promoted in modern culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's.</v>

23
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a virtue that you can hardly even </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about,</v>

24
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.500
<v Speaker 1>but humility means you probably not as </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart as you think you are and you </v>

25
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.570
<v Speaker 1>should be careful and so then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question might be,</v>

26
00:01:58.571 --> 00:01:59.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

27
00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>you should be careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps you still want to do good.</v>

28
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.340
<v Speaker 1>You want to make some positive changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you be careful and do good?</v>

29
00:02:06.341 --> 00:02:07.900
<v Speaker 1>And then I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

30
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>you try not to step outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries of your competence and you </v>

31
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.411
<v Speaker 1>start small and you start with things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you actually could adjust that you </v>

32
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:17.800
<v Speaker 1>actually do understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you actually could fix.</v>

33
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned to you at one point that one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things Carl Jung said was that </v>

34
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.630
<v Speaker 1>modern men don't see God because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't look low enough.</v>

35
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.120
<v Speaker 1>So very interesting phrase and one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that I've been promoting,</v>

36
00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:36.571
<v Speaker 1>I suppose online is the idea that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should restrict your attempts to fix </v>

37
00:02:37.871 --> 00:02:42.871
<v Speaker 1>things to what's at hand.</v>

38
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.340
<v Speaker 1>So there's probably things about you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could fix things that you know </v>

39
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.910
<v Speaker 1>that aren't right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not anyone else's opinion,</v>

40
00:02:51.911 --> 00:02:53.710
<v Speaker 1>your own opinion that aren't right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can fix them.</v>

41
00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's some things that you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjust in your family,</v>

42
00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.230
<v Speaker 1>although that gets hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have your act together a </v>

43
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.871
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can start to adjust your family </v>

44
00:03:03.871 --> 00:03:03.871
<v Speaker 1>because things can kick back on you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard and you think,</v>

45
00:03:03.871 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to put yourself together.</v>

46
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to put your family </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

47
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Why the hell do you think you can put </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world together?</v>

48
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.630
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously the world is more </v>

49
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.630
<v Speaker 1>complicated than you and your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you,</v>

50
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 1>if you're stymied in your attempts even </v>
<v Speaker 1>to set your own house in order,</v>

51
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.700
<v Speaker 1>which of course you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you would think that what that </v>

52
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.551
<v Speaker 1>would do would be to make you very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very leery about announcing your broad </v>

53
00:03:26.551 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>scale plans for social revolution.</v>

54
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a peculiar thing because that isn't</v>

55
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:37.081
<v Speaker 1>how it works because people are much </v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely to announce their plans for </v>

56
00:03:37.081 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 1>broad scale social revolution than they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are to try to set themselves straight or</v>

57
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:44.611
<v Speaker 1>to set their family's straight and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think the reason for that is that as </v>

58
00:03:44.611 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 1>soon as they try to set themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight or their families,</v>

59
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 1>the system immediately kicks back at </v>
<v Speaker 1>them right instantly.</v>

60
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if they announced their plans </v>
<v Speaker 1>for large scale social revolution,</v>

61
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.130
<v Speaker 1>the lag between the announcement and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kickback is so long that they don't </v>

62
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:03.060
<v Speaker 1>recognize that there's any error there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you know,</v>

63
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 1>you can get away with being wrong if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

64
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.940
<v Speaker 1>if nothing falls on you for a while and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

65
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.880
<v Speaker 1>and it's also an incitement to hubris </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can now see your,</v>

66
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.550
<v Speaker 1>your plans for large scale social </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution and stand back and you don't </v>

67
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 1>get hit by lightning and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

68
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 1>I might be right.</v>

69
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Even though you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're seriously not right.</v>

70
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

71
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how wonderful is that?</v>

72
00:04:28.961 --> 00:04:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you could do it without </v>
<v Speaker 1>any real effort.</v>

73
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.780
<v Speaker 1>And I really do think fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that that's what universities </v>

74
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.470
<v Speaker 1>teach students now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they teach them to do.</v>

75
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.860
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's absolutely appalling </v>

76
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.500
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's horribly dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not that easy to fix </v>

77
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you don't,</v>

78
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.160
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're not committed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

79
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.100
<v Speaker 1>And I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're committed because what you try</v>

80
00:04:57.101 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 1>to do is you try to straighten out your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own life first and that's enough.</v>

81
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Like there's this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a statement in the new </v>

82
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.201
<v Speaker 1>testament that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in the new testament that </v>

83
00:05:07.201 --> 00:05:07.390
<v Speaker 1>it's more difficult to rule yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>than to rule the city.</v>

84
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's not a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like all of you who've made </v>

85
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.570
<v Speaker 1>announcements to yourself about changing</v>
<v Speaker 1>your diet and going to the gym every </v>

86
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.820
<v Speaker 1>January know perfectly well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how difficult it is to regulate your own</v>

87
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.250
<v Speaker 1>impulses and to bring yourself under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>control of some.</v>

88
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.120
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well structured and ethical,</v>

89
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.120
<v Speaker 1>attentive structure of values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's extraordinarily difficult.</v>

90
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:44.491
<v Speaker 1>And so people don't do it and instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>they wander off and I think they create </v>

91
00:05:44.491 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 1>towers of Babel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the story indicates,</v>

92
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.650
<v Speaker 1>well those things collapse under their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own weight and everyone goes their own </v>

93
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.650
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

94
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 1>I think I see that happening with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lgbt community.</v>

95
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 1>I think because one of the things I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>noticed,</v>

96
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:06.881
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community is in some sense it's not a </v>

97
00:06:06.881 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

98
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>that's a technical error,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

99
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>It's composed of outsiders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

100
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.930
<v Speaker 1>and what you notice across the decades </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the acronym list keeps growing </v>

101
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.870
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's because there's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite number of ways to be an </v>

102
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.961
<v Speaker 1>outsider and so once you open the door </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the construction of a group that's </v>

103
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:34.520
<v Speaker 1>characterized by failing to fit into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>

104
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 1>then you immediately create a category </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's infinitely expandable.</v>

105
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't know how long the acronym</v>
<v Speaker 1>list is now.</v>

106
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.540
<v Speaker 1>It depends on which acronym list you </v>
<v Speaker 1>consult,</v>

107
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.840
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen lists of 10 or more </v>
<v Speaker 1>acronyms and one of the things that's </v>

108
00:06:50.631 --> 00:06:55.631
<v Speaker 1>happening is that the community is </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to fragment in its in its </v>

109
00:06:56.811 --> 00:07:01.811
<v Speaker 1>interior because there is no unity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you put a sufficient plurality </v>

110
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:07.541
<v Speaker 1>under the sheltering structure of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single umbrella,</v>

111
00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:11.940
<v Speaker 1>say the disunity starts to appear </v>
<v Speaker 1>within,</v>

112
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:17.630
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's also a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a manifestation of the same issue </v>

113
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 1>that this particular story is dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

114
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.760
<v Speaker 1>so that ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

115
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.870
<v Speaker 1>the most archaic stories in the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about the flood story </v>

116
00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:37.170
<v Speaker 1>and and also the Tower of Babel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they outline the two fundamental</v>

117
00:07:37.171 --> 00:07:41.640
<v Speaker 1>dangers that be set mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is the probability that</v>

118
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.950
<v Speaker 1>blindness and sin will produce a natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe or entice one.</v>

119
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.760
<v Speaker 1>That's something modern people are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of in principle,</v>

120
00:07:50.761 --> 00:07:55.761
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we're all hyper concerned about </v>

121
00:07:55.761 --> 00:07:55.761
<v Speaker 1>environmental degradation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe,</v>

122
00:07:55.761 --> 00:08:00.020
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the continual reactivation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an archetypal idea in our,</v>

123
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.590
<v Speaker 1>in our unconscious minds that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about the way we're living </v>

124
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.860
<v Speaker 1>that's unsustainable and that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>create a catastrophe and so interesting </v>

125
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:14.421
<v Speaker 1>because people believe that firmly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply and but they don't see the </v>

126
00:08:14.521 --> 00:08:17.880
<v Speaker 1>relationship between that and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archetypal stories because it's the same</v>

127
00:08:17.881 --> 00:08:21.660
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overconsumption greed,</v>

128
00:08:21.661 --> 00:08:26.661
<v Speaker 1>all of that is producing an unstable </v>
<v Speaker 1>state and nature will rebel and take us </v>

129
00:08:26.761 --> 00:08:27.630
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

130
00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.470
<v Speaker 1>You hear that every day in every </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper and every TV station.</v>

131
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.910
<v Speaker 1>It's broadcast to you constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that idea is presented in,</v>

132
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:41.660
<v Speaker 1>in genesis and the story of Noah and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then the other warning that exists in </v>

133
00:08:41.791 --> 00:08:46.791
<v Speaker 1>the stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is beware of natural catastrophe </v>

134
00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:49.551
<v Speaker 1>that's produced as a consequence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>blindness and greed will say the other </v>

135
00:08:49.551 --> 00:08:53.931
<v Speaker 1>is be aware of social structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That overreach because it will also </v>

136
00:08:56.251 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 1>produce fragmentation and disintegration</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's quite remarkable.</v>

137
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:05.331
<v Speaker 1>I think that that with at the close of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of the Tower of Babel,</v>

138
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:11.540
<v Speaker 1>we've got both of the permanent </v>
<v Speaker 1>existential dangers that present </v>

139
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 1>themselves to humanity already </v>
<v Speaker 1>identified.</v>
