1
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Buddha finds his enlightenment under a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.610
<v Speaker 1>It's not fluke that that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his natural environment and he's </v>

3
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.490
<v Speaker 1>sitting in the Lotus here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Lotus opens up.</v>

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.350
<v Speaker 1>It's this thing that springs up from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>depths and he sits there illuminated the</v>

5
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:20.351
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a halo that's the sun that </v>

6
00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:20.690
<v Speaker 1>stands for higher consciousness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>

7
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.410
<v Speaker 1>He's transcended by accepting the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that life is suffering.</v>

8
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.360
<v Speaker 1>He's transcended the limitations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are part of mortality.</v>

9
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.770
<v Speaker 1>You see that symbol there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that swastika.</v>

10
00:00:35.771 --> 00:00:37.210
<v Speaker 1>You see it there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's reversed.</v>

11
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.590
<v Speaker 1>The Nazis reversed it.</v>

12
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about that mean they weren't </v>

13
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.291
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If symbolism there symbols had meaning </v>

14
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:51.590
<v Speaker 1>is what this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were represented was what this </v>

15
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.691
<v Speaker 1>represents reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>that's a very bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing that this,</v>

17
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.450
<v Speaker 1>this idea is what enables people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>transcend their suffering,</v>

18
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>and Buddha said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

19
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be too attached to things,</v>

20
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>and what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean deny the world.</v>

21
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>It might mean deny the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're too in love with the material,</v>

22
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>like with material wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

23
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Then your pathway to transcendence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning might be to abandon that because</v>

24
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 1>it's constraining you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's making you less than you could be,</v>

25
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.420
<v Speaker 1>but the fundamental lesson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more fundamental lesson that's </v>

26
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.841
<v Speaker 1>underneath that is don't let what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are stopped you from being what you </v>

27
00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

28
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 1>and so then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

29
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:35.910
<v Speaker 1>what do you identify with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you identify with what you are?</v>

30
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Then you're a tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you identify with with chaos,</v>

31
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.050
<v Speaker 1>because that's the opposite of order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say then you're nihilistic ball.</v>

32
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.140
<v Speaker 1>You don't identify with either of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that they're both necessary.</v>

33
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:52.850
<v Speaker 1>You know that you have to live with both</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them,</v>

34
00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:57.851
<v Speaker 1>but you would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You identify with the capacity to </v>

35
00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:01.070
<v Speaker 1>continually transcend what you are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you seek out error.</v>

36
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.860
<v Speaker 1>That's what humility is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm an error ridden psych,</v>

37
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.020
<v Speaker 1>so I want to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to put myself in a situation </v>

38
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.051
<v Speaker 1>where I can discover one of my errors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully not in a way that's going to </v>

39
00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:14.660
<v Speaker 1>knock me completely out of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

40
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanna.</v>

41
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I want to seek out a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to find out where my limits are,</v>

42
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:24.131
<v Speaker 1>I want to find out where there's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough of me yet and I want to do it </v>

43
00:02:24.131 --> 00:02:27.701
<v Speaker 1>that in a way that's engaging because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you can wear yourself out </v>

44
00:02:27.701 --> 00:02:31.000
<v Speaker 1>fighting dragons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so obviously you can exhaust yourself </v>

45
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.000
<v Speaker 1>completely and that's not helpful.</v>

46
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.290
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

47
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.080
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

48
00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:38.081
<v Speaker 1>when I was coaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was coaching lawyers who these </v>

49
00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:41.831
<v Speaker 1>were people who had very high end </v>
<v Speaker 1>careers and so they had an infinite </v>

50
00:02:41.831 --> 00:02:45.101
<v Speaker 1>workload,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how much they worked flat out </v>

51
00:02:45.101 --> 00:02:45.101
<v Speaker 1>there was always way more work that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>should do.</v>

52
00:02:45.101 --> 00:02:49.061
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult thing to learn to </v>
<v Speaker 1>manage and so they were exhausting </v>

53
00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:49.790
<v Speaker 1>themselves and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

54
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to work less per day.</v>

55
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:52.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

56
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.590
<v Speaker 1>that's not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>

57
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.010
<v Speaker 1>And so what I learned over time was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

58
00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>so this is what you have to do every </v>
<v Speaker 1>three months.</v>

59
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>You have to block off four days and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a vacation,</v>

60
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.400
<v Speaker 1>and you have to plan that in advance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's in your calendar so that your </v>

61
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.101
<v Speaker 1>secretary doesn't book your time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you need that because you have to </v>

62
00:03:11.101 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 1>recuperate enough so that you can work </v>
<v Speaker 1>as hard as you're going to work.</v>

63
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>And of course they were nervous about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and I said,</v>

64
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can.</v>

65
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.120
<v Speaker 1>We can calibrate this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep track of your billable hours </v>

66
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.511
<v Speaker 1>over the next year and see if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase or decrease because I bet you </v>

67
00:03:24.511 --> 00:03:27.931
<v Speaker 1>if you take more time off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll actually have more billable </v>

68
00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:31.290
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll actually have your cake and eat </v>

69
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.290
<v Speaker 1>it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll get to have a vacation and you'll</v>

70
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>be more productive and that inevitably </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was what happened.</v>

71
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a matter of calibrating </v>
<v Speaker 1>the game properly.</v>

72
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:42.061
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to play a game that you can </v>

73
00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:42.061
<v Speaker 1>play today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also one that you can play next week</v>

74
00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 1>and next month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about,</v>

75
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

76
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 1>your career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This week we're talking about you having</v>

77
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>a career that lasts 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't kill you,</v>

78
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make you hate yourself or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the job that doesn't make you better.</v>

79
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't where you to a frazzle.</v>

80
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.790
<v Speaker 1>So it has to be optimized and so I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can in fact decide to take on </v>

81
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 1>the load that's optimally meaningful if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want,</v>

82
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>and then you get to have your cake and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat it too.</v>

83
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 1>You're on the pathway to continual </v>
<v Speaker 1>incremental improvement.</v>

84
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:13.831
<v Speaker 1>You only have to burn off a feather at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>time instead of having the whole bloody </v>

85
00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 1>thing burst into flames.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a constant.</v>

86
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a constant source of renewal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an idea that to be renewed you </v>

87
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 1>have to drink the water of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

88
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>That that's an old mythological idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's the water?</v>

89
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>The water of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chaos is water,</v>

90
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.900
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water is chaos.</v>

91
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Water is what washes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too much order.</v>

92
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.840
<v Speaker 1>And to stay continually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say a refreshed by the water of </v>

93
00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:42.241
<v Speaker 1>life is to take on exactly the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of chaos to make sure that your </v>

94
00:04:42.241 --> 00:04:46.740
<v Speaker 1>garden is properly nourished and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning is actually the marker of that.</v>

95
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as I said,</v>

96
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:53.791
<v Speaker 1>you know that I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't consider myself either naive </v>

97
00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 1>or particularly optimistic person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm either of those,</v>

98
00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.210
<v Speaker 1>but this is an actually an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the only ideas that I've </v>

99
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 1>ever found that I really believe to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>rock solid.</v>

100
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:06.871
<v Speaker 1>I actually think that it's true and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>very optimistic because it says you can </v>

101
00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:09.460
<v Speaker 1>use your sense of meaning to calibrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>your progress through life,</v>

102
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.380
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's rules.</v>

103
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:16.381
<v Speaker 1>You have to aim at the highest possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>good that you can conceive now and </v>

104
00:05:16.381 --> 00:05:17.200
<v Speaker 1>that's subject to update because what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell you know,</v>

105
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:22.201
<v Speaker 1>but you start by aiming at the star you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can see rather than the dimmer one that </v>

106
00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>you can't yet perceive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you decide that you're going to</v>

107
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:25.870
<v Speaker 1>do that honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

108
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:27.610
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big decision.</v>

109
00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:32.611
<v Speaker 1>So the first decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in some senses that decision of </v>

110
00:05:32.611 --> 00:05:35.971
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to decide that being is </v>

111
00:05:35.971 --> 00:05:37.300
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile and that you're going to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>for its betterment and that's a decision</v>

112
00:05:37.301 --> 00:05:38.320
<v Speaker 1>that's based on love.</v>

113
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 1>And the second decision is based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

114
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:43.210
<v Speaker 1>Having made that decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to play a straight game.</v>

115
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Having made those two decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that you can allow your sense of</v>

116
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:51.391
<v Speaker 1>meaning to calibrate your pathway and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then what's so interesting is that you </v>

117
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:54.940
<v Speaker 1>hit a state that's as close to paradise </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you're going to hit right away.</v>

118
00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:59.941
<v Speaker 1>Because being engaged like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's better to be engaged in the </v>

119
00:05:59.941 --> 00:06:02.570
<v Speaker 1>solution of a complex problem that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a problem at all.</v>

120
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's no different than saying it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>better for there to be being the non </v>

121
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.481
<v Speaker 1>being because being is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you want to have no problems,</v>

122
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:16.610
<v Speaker 1>then you have no being and and you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

123
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being so miserable that maybe that's the</v>

124
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 1>route we should take and fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you can have your cake and eat</v>

125
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 1>it too.</v>

126
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.490
<v Speaker 1>You can have the damn problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be a problem we're solving and </v>

127
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.781
<v Speaker 1>you can be so engaged in solving the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem that it justifies the fact that </v>

128
00:06:31.781 --> 00:06:33.740
<v Speaker 1>the problem exists and then you get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you get to have.</v>

129
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 1>You get to have the problem and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution at the same time.</v>

130
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's better than not having </v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem at all.</v>

131
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things I have seen,</v>

132
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:46.721
<v Speaker 1>and I've seen this so interesting being </v>
<v Speaker 1>so interesting when I've been lecturing </v>

133
00:06:46.721 --> 00:06:50.291
<v Speaker 1>to people especially more recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is also manifested itself on </v>

134
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to people a lot about </v>

135
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and it's young men in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular that seem to be responding to</v>

136
00:06:56.871 --> 00:07:01.871
<v Speaker 1>that and I think that's partly because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that young women in some sense </v>

137
00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 1>have their responsibility map already </v>
<v Speaker 1>laid out for them.</v>

138
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.950
<v Speaker 1>It's also less voluntary in some sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>for women because they have more </v>

139
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:09.860
<v Speaker 1>complicated problems to solve in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first part of their life,</v>

140
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take because they have to get the family</v>

141
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.340
<v Speaker 1>problem solved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But whatever.</v>

142
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking very in a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>delineated matter about responsibility,</v>

143
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 1>which is a strange thing to sell to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

144
00:07:21.711 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Speaker 1>but responsibility is what gives your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life meaning and so then you might say,</v>

145
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:29.420
<v Speaker 1>well then take ultimate responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what happens?</v>

146
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 1>You have an ultimately meaningful life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you might say,</v>

147
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:33.650
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your life is ultimately meaningful,</v>

148
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter if it's punctuated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy or even predicated on tragedy.</v>

149
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 1>It's worth it.</v>

150
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

151
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.810
<v Speaker 1>everything I've seen indicates to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

152
00:07:46.811 --> 00:07:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Every time I get my clients to take on </v>
<v Speaker 1>more responsibility,</v>

153
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't an injunction.</v>

154
00:07:52.421 --> 00:07:54.670
<v Speaker 1>You're a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should take on responsibility.</v>

155
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.940
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can define the damn responsibility.</v>

156
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.700
<v Speaker 1>It isn't something that someone else </v>
<v Speaker 1>should impose on you.</v>

157
00:08:00.701 --> 00:08:04.060
<v Speaker 1>It's not a matter of doing what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should do in some abstract manner.</v>

158
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:09.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not that it's the choice of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>game you're going to play and you know </v>

159
00:08:09.911 --> 00:08:11.920
<v Speaker 1>you can play the game of the seeker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

160
00:08:11.921 --> 00:08:16.921
<v Speaker 1>And if you play that game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then everyone wins and it's the best </v>

161
00:08:16.921 --> 00:08:17.440
<v Speaker 1>game you can play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

162
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.530
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer in some sense to the tragedy </v>

163
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:22.900
<v Speaker 1>of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the catastrophe of life to the fall,</v>

164
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:28.590
<v Speaker 1>is to adopt the responsibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality that goes along with that and </v>

165
00:08:28.721 --> 00:08:32.350
<v Speaker 1>to play that game maximally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And paradoxically,</v>

166
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.320
<v Speaker 1>it's in the willingness to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the solution emerges.</v>
