1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.110
<v Speaker 1>The internal problem is how do you deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with tragedy and malevolence and you can</v>

2
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:04.440
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:05.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm not prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.470
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

5
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Unsurprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you were over protected as</v>

6
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good idea to overprotect your</v>

7
00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:18.291
<v Speaker 1>kids because the snakes are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come into the garden no matter what you </v>

8
00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:22.101
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then you instead of trying to </v>

9
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 1>keep the damn snakes away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you are a mere child with</v>

10
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:28.251
<v Speaker 1>something that can help them chop them </v>
<v Speaker 1>into pieces and make the world out of </v>

11
00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:31.641
<v Speaker 1>them so that the trick for human </v>
<v Speaker 1>thriving in the face of suffering and </v>

12
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>malevolence is strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not protection.</v>

13
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a completely different idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also know this clinically.</v>

14
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.040
<v Speaker 1>We know for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you treat people with exposure </v>

15
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>therapy for agora phobia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is roughly speaking,</v>

16
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.980
<v Speaker 1>the fear of chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the fear of everything.</v>

17
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 1>You don't make them less afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make them braver.</v>

18
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing because with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>agoraphobic,</v>

19
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:58.401
<v Speaker 1>see what happens to them is the fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never conceptualized death and </v>

20
00:00:58.401 --> 00:00:59.880
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're naive,</v>

21
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>

22
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>It never enters their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The theater of their imagination and </v>

23
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.030
<v Speaker 1>it's because they're protected from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then something happens.</v>

24
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>This often happens to women in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>forties because they're.</v>

25
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>They're the people most likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop agoraphobic.</v>

26
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Something happens there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been protected from chaos by </v>

27
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.601
<v Speaker 1>authority their entire life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe they had an overprotective </v>

28
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 1>father and then they went to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>overprotective boyfriend and then they </v>

29
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>went to an over protective husband and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they were willing to be subjugated</v>

30
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:28.560
<v Speaker 1>to all three of those because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>project protection.</v>

31
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so so that's the bargain.</v>

32
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>They stay weak and dependent and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to because that's the only way</v>

33
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>they can appeal to the person who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper protective,</v>

34
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:42.891
<v Speaker 1>but the price they pay for that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not sufficiently competent and </v>

35
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>then something happens in their life.</v>

36
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Often in their forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they develop heart palpitations maybe as</v>

37
00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:51.511
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of menopause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their heart starts to beat a radically </v>

38
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:52.020
<v Speaker 1>and they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

39
00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

40
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are you going to talk to about that?</v>

41
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no protection from authority for</v>

42
00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:02.721
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe their friend gets divorced or </v>

43
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:02.721
<v Speaker 1>maybe their sister dies or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

44
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>It brings up the specter of mortality </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the specter of malevolence and</v>

45
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:11.391
<v Speaker 1>mortality and it brings it up in a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>that authority recourse to authority </v>

46
00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>cannot solve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so then they have panic attacks.</v>

47
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go out,</v>

48
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>they get afraid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel their heart beating.</v>

49
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Then they get afraid of their heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>beating because they think,</v>

50
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.160
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die.</v>

51
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 1>And they think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

52
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:26.751
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die and I'm going to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fool of myself while I'm doing it and </v>

53
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:26.751
<v Speaker 1>attract a lot of attention.</v>

54
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>So the two big fears come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality and social judgment,</v>

55
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>and then they have a panic attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like fight or flights going out of </v>

56
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

57
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.891
<v Speaker 1>very unpleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they start to avoid the places </v>

58
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:42.681
<v Speaker 1>they've had a panic attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they ended up not being able to go </v>

59
00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then tie A.</v>

60
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Matt has come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write a huge monster,</v>

61
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>a little victim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what do you do with them?</v>

62
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no saying no.</v>

63
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 1>There's no tire map that's done right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

64
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Naivety is over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

65
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>they've had a direct contact with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>threat of mortality and social judgment.</v>

66
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.040
<v Speaker 1>They've met the terrible mother and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've met the terrible father and </v>

67
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 1>there's no going back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no saying,</v>

68
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is safe.</v>

69
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

70
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you think it's safe means </v>

71
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.941
<v Speaker 1>that you were living in an unconscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>bubble that was sort of provided to you </v>

72
00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>by your culture.</v>

73
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a gift and now that's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>shattered and so now what do you do?</v>

74
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is you retreat until you're </v>

75
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.380
<v Speaker 1>in your house and there's nowhere you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can go.</v>

76
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 1>You're the ultimate frozen rabbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

77
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>And your life is hell because you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

78
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>The alternative is let's take apart the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things you're afraid of.</v>

79
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>Let's expose you to them carefully and </v>
<v Speaker 1>programmatically,</v>

80
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>and then you'll learn that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're actually tougher than you think.</v>

81
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.330
<v Speaker 1>You never knew that and maybe you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to take on the responsibility </v>

82
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 1>because you know people play a role in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own demise,</v>

83
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:58.141
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you had an opportunity to go out </v>

84
00:03:58.141 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 1>and explore or withdraw because you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid,</v>

85
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 1>you chose to withdraw because you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>afraid,</v>

86
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 1>so it's not only that you were over </v>
<v Speaker 1>protected,</v>

87
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:08.401
<v Speaker 1>often it's that you were willing to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of the fact that you are </v>

88
00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 1>overprotected and run back there </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever you had the opportunity,</v>

89
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you're a kid in the playground,</v>

90
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

91
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>And you're having some trouble with </v>
<v Speaker 1>other kids and you know,</v>

92
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:20.881
<v Speaker 1>in the back of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should deal with deal with this </v>

93
00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:20.881
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you go and tell your mom and get her</v>

94
00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 1>to intervene and you know that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not right.</v>

95
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>You know that you're breaking the social</v>
<v Speaker 1>contract,</v>

96
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what you do.</v>

97
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 1>You run off to an authority figure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hide behind the great father,</v>

98
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking,</v>

99
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 1>while the problem with that is you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn how to do it yourself.</v>

100
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 1>So then you have to relearn it painfully</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're 40.</v>

101
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.250
<v Speaker 1>So then you take people out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

102
00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:43.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you afraid of?</v>

103
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Rank it from one to 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 10 is we'll make a list of 10 things </v>

104
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid of the least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that we're least afraid of.</v>

105
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>We'll call number 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll start with that.</v>

106
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

107
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:55.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid of elevators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

108
00:04:55.871 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 1>well let's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at a picture of an elevator.</v>

109
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Let's have you imagine being in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevator.</v>

110
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Let's go out to an elevator and let you </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch the terrible jaws of death open </v>

111
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 1>because that's how you're responding to </v>
<v Speaker 1>it symbolically,</v>

112
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to do that.</v>

113
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>Add it at the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The closest proximity you can manage.</v>

114
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.420
<v Speaker 1>You find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go do that.</v>

115
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're nervous as hell,</v>

116
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:21.280
<v Speaker 1>especially from an anticipatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

117
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 1>shaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go out,</v>

118
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.490
<v Speaker 1>you stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch it happen,</v>

119
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.970
<v Speaker 1>and he actually calmed down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do that 10 times and it no longer </v>

120
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.970
<v Speaker 1>bothers you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

121
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.260
<v Speaker 1>what you've learned that you didn't die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly than that,</v>

122
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 1>you've learned that you could withstand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the threat of death.</v>

123
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.220
<v Speaker 1>That's what you've learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you move a little closer and </v>

124
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.981
<v Speaker 1>then you move a little closer and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you move a little closer and finally </v>

125
00:05:43.981 --> 00:05:43.981
<v Speaker 1>you're back in.</v>

126
00:05:43.981 --> 00:05:45.550
<v Speaker 1>What's no longer the elevator from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbolic perspective?</v>

127
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a tomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

128
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:47.200
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

129
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 1>it's a place of enclosure and isolation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you learn.</v>

130
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 1>It turns out I can withstand that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're much more together,</v>

131
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.990
<v Speaker 1>much more confident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's often one of the things that </v>

132
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 1>often happens in situations like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this multiple times,</v>

133
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:08.081
<v Speaker 1>is that if you run someone through an </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposure training process like that and </v>

134
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.780
<v Speaker 1>toughen them up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll often start standing up to </v>

135
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.571
<v Speaker 1>people around them in a way they never </v>
<v Speaker 1>did before because they wouldn't stand </v>

136
00:06:16.571 --> 00:06:19.451
<v Speaker 1>up for themselves before because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't willing to undermine that </v>

137
00:06:19.451 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 1>protection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

138
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:25.721
<v Speaker 1>if you're protecting me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't bother you because I can't </v>

139
00:06:25.721 --> 00:06:29.990
<v Speaker 1>afford to forsake your protection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if I'm going to play that game,</v>

140
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be high hide behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I can't challenge you,</v>

141
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Speaker 1>so that's no good because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes white people.</v>

142
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.100
<v Speaker 1>You see this with guys very frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're still deathly afraid of their </v>

143
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.610
<v Speaker 1>fathers judgment when they're in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>thirties or forties.</v>

144
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

145
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:45.350
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

146
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.280
<v Speaker 1>because they still want to believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's someone out there that knows and</v>

147
00:06:49.281 --> 00:06:54.281
<v Speaker 1>so they're willing to accept the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjugation because it doesn't force </v>

148
00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:57.701
<v Speaker 1>them to challenge the idea that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone out there that knows because </v>

149
00:06:57.701 --> 00:06:58.250
<v Speaker 1>that's the advantage of having your </v>
<v Speaker 1>father as a judge,</v>

150
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he knows,</v>

151
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if he doesn't?</v>

152
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.100
<v Speaker 1>What if no one knows any better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

153
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a rough thing.</v>

154
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.210
<v Speaker 1>You don't until you realize that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not an adult.</v>

155
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really technically the point of </v>

156
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.031
<v Speaker 1>realization of adulthood is that no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually knows what you should do more </v>

157
00:07:16.031 --> 00:07:16.430
<v Speaker 1>than you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

158
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:18.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a horrible realization because what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell do you know?</v>

159
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.580
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible realization and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>will often pick slavery,</v>

160
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.210
<v Speaker 1>permanent slavery to the spirit of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great father,</v>

161
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:29.330
<v Speaker 1>let's say over that realization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's completely understandable,</v>

162
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:34.360
<v Speaker 1>but the problem with it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's more to you than you </v>

163
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.211
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you continue to hide behind </v>

164
00:07:37.211 --> 00:07:39.881
<v Speaker 1>that figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you never have a chance to </v>

165
00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:40.880
<v Speaker 1>understand that there's more to you than</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think far more than you think.</v>

166
00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's enough to you so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can actually withstand the threat of </v>

167
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.520
<v Speaker 1>mortality without collapsing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe even withstand the threat of </v>

168
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.700
<v Speaker 1>malevolence without collapsing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

169
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.930
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly possible and it's not an </v>
<v Speaker 1>abstract question.</v>

170
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.960
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the sort of question that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you address in the psychotherapeutic </v>

171
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.551
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always the question that you </v>

172
00:08:06.551 --> 00:08:08.861
<v Speaker 1>address and the answer is often in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>affirmative because people can get </v>

173
00:08:08.861 --> 00:08:13.241
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably tough and you know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people work in emergency wards </v>

174
00:08:13.241 --> 00:08:13.460
<v Speaker 1>in hospitals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

175
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Or they work in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in palliative care wards or they work as</v>

176
00:08:16.941 --> 00:08:21.941
<v Speaker 1>mortuary assistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these people have bloody rough </v>

177
00:08:21.941 --> 00:08:21.941
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:08:21.941 --> 00:08:23.990
<v Speaker 1>are there on the front line of police </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigation into,</v>

179
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highness child abuse crimes and so </v>

180
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:29.990
<v Speaker 1>they're confronting malevolence on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular basis and you know,</v>

181
00:08:29.991 --> 00:08:34.991
<v Speaker 1>those are very stressful jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people do them and some people do </v>

182
00:08:35.091 --> 00:08:40.091
<v Speaker 1>them without even being damaged by them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although that's a harder thing because </v>

183
00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:40.970
<v Speaker 1>you can see horrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

184
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.230
<v Speaker 1>things you will never forget.</v>
