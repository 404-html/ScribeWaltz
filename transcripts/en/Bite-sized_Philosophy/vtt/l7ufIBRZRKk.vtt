1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.230
<v Speaker 1>That says office and you need to set of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scissors,</v>

2
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.580
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one has to imagine him happy.</v>

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's a rock at the bottom of the </v>

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.041
<v Speaker 1>hill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you might as well push it up the </v>

5
00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:14.991
<v Speaker 1>hill and if it rolls back down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then you've got something else to </v>

6
00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:14.991
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you can push the damn rock back up</v>

7
00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:19.641
<v Speaker 1>the hill and there's no shortage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rocks to put up to push up the hill and </v>

8
00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:23.631
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're built for anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so let's go out and like push them </v>

9
00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:23.760
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boulders up the hill,</v>

10
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:27.780
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe we could have enough self</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence and enough enough respect for</v>

11
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:32.781
<v Speaker 1>ourselves that we wouldn't have to turn </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hatred and revenge and try to take </v>

12
00:00:32.781 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>everything down because I think that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the alternative.</v>

13
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.420
<v Speaker 1>So he's not weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing you can say about them.</v>

14
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Same idea represented there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

15
00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:45.540
<v Speaker 1>That's outlets who voluntarily takes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world on his shoulders.</v>

16
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like the idea of Christ taking the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sins of the world on his shoulders.</v>

17
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.350
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly the same notion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the notion that you should be </v>

18
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.681
<v Speaker 1>able to recognize in yourself all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horror of humanity and take </v>

19
00:00:57.681 --> 00:01:02.001
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for it because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means and the thing that's so </v>

20
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>interesting about that is that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can recognize yourself in yourself,</v>

21
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:09.021
<v Speaker 1>all the horror of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will instantly have a hell of a lot </v>

22
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:09.870
<v Speaker 1>more respect for yourself than you did </v>
<v Speaker 1>before you did that.</v>

23
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Because there's some real utility in </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing that you're a monster now.</v>

24
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>And just because you're a monster </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean you have to be a monster.</v>

25
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.320
<v Speaker 1>But it's really useful to know that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are one.</v>

26
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.740
<v Speaker 1>So the and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that you knew,</v>

27
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:27.741
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that I find so </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing about his writings and I think </v>

28
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 1>something that really distinguishes </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

29
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.900
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Joseph Campbell who talked about </v>

30
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>following your bliss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like young said very clearly that the</v>

31
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 1>first step to enlightenment is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounter with the shadow.</v>

32
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.850
<v Speaker 1>And what he meant by that was everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible that human beings have done was</v>

33
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 1>done by human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your one of the.</v>

34
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.930
<v Speaker 1>And so if you don't understand that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand that really means to know </v>

35
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>how it was that you could have done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a shattering thing,</v>

36
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>to try to imagine that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to imagine yourself as someone </v>

37
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.920
<v Speaker 1>who's engaged in medieval torture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see how you could in fact do that.</v>

38
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.780
<v Speaker 1>You're never the same after you learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

39
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>but being never the same after learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is unbelievably useful because when</v>

40
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:10.950
<v Speaker 1>you understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're like,</v>

41
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.410
<v Speaker 1>then you're a whole different creature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think,</v>

42
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>and this is something I did learn from </v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

43
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:20.001
<v Speaker 1>is that you cannot be a good person </v>
<v Speaker 1>until you know how much evil you contain</v>

44
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>within you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not possible.</v>

45
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.510
<v Speaker 1>And it's partly because you just don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any potency.</v>

46
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're just naive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're just nice,</v>

47
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:30.040
<v Speaker 1>if you'd never heard anyone you'd never </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard of fly.</v>

48
00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>You don't have the capability for any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

49
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Why would anyone ever take you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seriously?</v>

50
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just,</v>

51
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>you're a domestic animal at best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather contemptible one at that.</v>

53
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.810
<v Speaker 1>And it's a very strange thing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't think that the revelation </v>

54
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.891
<v Speaker 1>of the capacity for evil is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>precondition for the realization of </v>

55
00:02:48.891 --> 00:02:48.891
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe,</v>

56
00:02:48.891 --> 00:02:53.840
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you be serious enough to even </v>

57
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.631
<v Speaker 1>attempt to pursue the good unless you </v>
<v Speaker 1>had some sense of what the consequence </v>

58
00:02:56.631 --> 00:02:58.060
<v Speaker 1>was of not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

59
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 1>You have to be serious about these sorts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things.</v>

60
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:01.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a.</v>

61
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not the game of a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>It's the game of a fully developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>adult.</v>

63
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>And you have learned this in part when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had little kids,</v>

64
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a chapter for my new book called</v>
<v Speaker 1>never let your children do anything that</v>

65
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 1>makes you dislike them.</v>

66
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 1>And why was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I read,</v>

67
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.510
<v Speaker 1>I read that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote that after I knew I was a monster </v>

68
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.780
<v Speaker 1>and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make sure I like my kids.</v>

69
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make sure that they behave </v>
<v Speaker 1>around me so that I liked them because </v>

70
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm way bigger than them and I'm way </v>
<v Speaker 1>more cruel than they are.</v>

71
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 1>And I've got tricks up my sleeve that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they cannot even possibly imagine.</v>

72
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they irritate me,</v>

73
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.350
<v Speaker 1>I will absolutely take it out on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't think that you're the </v>

74
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.161
<v Speaker 1>sort of person that would do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you are the sort of person who is </v>

75
00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
