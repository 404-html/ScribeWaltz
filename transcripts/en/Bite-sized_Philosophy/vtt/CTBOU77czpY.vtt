1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.350
<v Speaker 1>So I got out a textbook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was called race class and gender and </v>

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.281
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an anthology that's used in </v>

3
00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:12.070
<v Speaker 1>cultural studies courses in women's </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies courses and it's Sorta the goto </v>

4
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.091
<v Speaker 1>texts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm told and I'm reading it and I </v>

5
00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:19.031
<v Speaker 1>turned it and I would turn to page 14 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can tell you it's page 14 because </v>

6
00:00:19.031 --> 00:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>I was so astounded by what I found and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it said,</v>

7
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>

8
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says objectivity as found through </v>

9
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.031
<v Speaker 1>rational thought is a western and </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine concept that we will challenge</v>

10
00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:33.050
<v Speaker 1>throughout this text.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

11
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.280
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said it's too bad.</v>

13
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:41.151
<v Speaker 1>It's too bad that you're shocked by that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the want to go for irrational pc</v>

14
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:44.640
<v Speaker 1>types have been saying exactly that </v>
<v Speaker 1>since the 19 seventies.</v>

15
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.950
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is exactly.</v>

16
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Make no mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why mcclachi is wrong.</v>

17
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.200
<v Speaker 1>This isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't something they're secreting </v>

18
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.200
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

19
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.540
<v Speaker 1>This is the dead statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

20
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.850
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.210
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole notion of logic and coherence </v>

22
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.690
<v Speaker 1>and empirical data for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very nature of evidence.</v>

23
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Let's question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's question the definition of </v>

24
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.110
<v Speaker 1>evidence because the underlying idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

25
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 1>the underlying idea here is that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies are predicated on power,</v>

26
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>so if the reason that I put forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>something as evidence isn't because it's</v>

27
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:20.280
<v Speaker 1>evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's evidence that I get to</v>

28
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:23.790
<v Speaker 1>have that position of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you're a postmodernist and you</v>

29
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:24.120
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

30
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:29.121
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to question your evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you think you're saying is you're </v>

31
00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 1>going to question my claim to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary power.</v>

32
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea that there's evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of claims of arbitrary power.</v>

33
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 1>The postmodernist dispensed without the </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 seventies.</v>

34
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.320
<v Speaker 1>That's Derrida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what he said it all.</v>

35
00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:46.321
<v Speaker 1>This time I've been trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>samples of thousands so that I could </v>

36
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:46.321
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a little bit.</v>

37
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.960
<v Speaker 1>We can say something God just in </v>
<v Speaker 1>generalized.</v>

38
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

39
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:54.351
<v Speaker 1>That just demonstrates how thoroughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrenched you are in the reining </v>

40
00:01:54.351 --> 00:01:54.390
<v Speaker 1>patriarchal ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

41
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>and I was just hoping to get beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>anecdotal.</v>

42
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 1>There's no beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no beyond anecdotal.</v>

43
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:02.180
<v Speaker 1>That's become a methodology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's audible.</v>

44
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.880
<v Speaker 1>It's called auto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethnography is a technical term for it </v>

45
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>and auto ethnography is the publication </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a journey of a,</v>

46
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 1>of a private diary essentially in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothetically reputable,</v>

47
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.160
<v Speaker 1>reputable academic journal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It it's only because of in the last </v>

48
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.220
<v Speaker 1>three or four years that these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been happening and I said,</v>

49
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do they get this?</v>

50
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>How do they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do they find these thoughts?</v>

51
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

52
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.180
<v Speaker 1>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to fall into the mistake </v>

53
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.601
<v Speaker 1>of making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of making the assumption that this </v>

54
00:02:38.601 --> 00:02:41.241
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been thought through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are not just misunderstanding </v>

55
00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 1>what evidence is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That isn't what's happening at all.</v>

56
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.260
<v Speaker 1>When they say they want to question the </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition of evidence,</v>

57
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.560
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what they mean when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>say we want to question the definition </v>

58
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.521
<v Speaker 1>of evidence because the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence currently supports the </v>

59
00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 1>scientific power structure in chemistry </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

60
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 1>and that's fundamentally dominated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say white men.</v>

61
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.040
<v Speaker 1>We can go after the definition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence itself and that's how we're </v>

62
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.281
<v Speaker 1>going to bring it down and so the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on the hit list are going to be </v>

63
00:03:08.281 --> 00:03:11.671
<v Speaker 1>the biologists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're already under attack from the </v>

64
00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>social justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It said that mathematics is whiteness,</v>

65
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

66
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.470
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

67
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that mathematics could </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a race.</v>

68
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but thing.</v>

69
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 1>The thing is there's nothing logical </v>
<v Speaker 1>about these claims.</v>

70
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Once you accept this central axioms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the axioms are straightforward.</v>

71
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>The world is a battle ground of power </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies.</v>

72
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.780
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't anything else outside of </v>

73
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.571
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and each power hierarchy generates its </v>

74
00:03:36.571 --> 00:03:39.961
<v Speaker 1>own internal narrative including rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>for what constitutes evidence that </v>

75
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:46.411
<v Speaker 1>support and buttress the structure of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that hierarchy and because the </v>

76
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:51.421
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy's exclude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's in the best interests of the </v>

77
00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 1>people who are excluded to invert the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

78
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.880
<v Speaker 1>and of course they also regard that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>just even though that's part of the </v>

79
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.571
<v Speaker 1>incoherence of the entire argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where they have to turn to to </v>

80
00:04:00.571 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Marxism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but make no mistake about it.</v>

81
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 1>This isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't accidental.</v>

82
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 1>It isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People misunderstanding what constitutes</v>

83
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>
