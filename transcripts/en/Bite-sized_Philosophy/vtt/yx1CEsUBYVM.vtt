<v Speaker 1>Dr brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.610
<v Speaker 1>you've talked about a nonmonetary </v>
<v Speaker 1>orders,</v>

3
00:00:04.611 --> 00:00:07.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could include sanctions like orders</v>

4
00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:09.710
<v Speaker 1>to undertake sensitivity and anti bias </v>
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

5
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:16.060
<v Speaker 1>I would like either one or both of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to comment on whether you could explain </v>

6
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:21.191
<v Speaker 1>why an individual may have a strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>objection to undertaking such a </v>

7
00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:22.670
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Mr Brown,</v>

8
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:25.310
<v Speaker 1>could you let the committee know how </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious the sanction could be?</v>

9
00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:27.520
<v Speaker 1>And of course you already dead on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.570
<v Speaker 1>if you refuse to undertake such an </v>
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

11
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and specifically at the federal level,</v>

12
00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:33.050
<v Speaker 1>but what would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would,</v>

13
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.530
<v Speaker 1>why would people have an objection to </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking such training?</v>

14
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.600
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to let Dr Peterson </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer why he or someone like him might </v>

15
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.670
<v Speaker 1>have an objection to undertaking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>type of training and lot obviously,</v>

16
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.650
<v Speaker 1>once again with the severity of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>

17
00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:46.910
<v Speaker 1>If it gets before the tribunal,</v>

18
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.350
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a profound objection to,</v>

19
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.180
<v Speaker 2>to undergoing such training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

20
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.750
<v Speaker 2>I would flatly refuse under all </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions to undergo it.</v>

21
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.030
<v Speaker 2>And the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's multiple reasons for that.</v>

22
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.720
<v Speaker 2>The first reason is that the science </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounding the,</v>

23
00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:06.721
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the so called charge of implicit bias </v>

24
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:08.120
<v Speaker 2>that's associated with perception is by </v>
<v Speaker 2>no means settled in,</v>

25
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.560
<v Speaker 2>in to such a degree that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>three people who designed the most </v>

26
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.390
<v Speaker 2>commonly used measure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the implicit association test,</v>

27
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker 2>has detached himself from the other two </v>
<v Speaker 2>researchers on the grounds that the use </v>

28
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.461
<v Speaker 2>of the test has become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has far transcended its scientific </v>

29
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:30.361
<v Speaker 2>validity and reliability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nowhere near valid or reliable </v>

30
00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:30.880
<v Speaker 2>enough to be used in the manner that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been using.</v>

31
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.060
<v Speaker 2>And even the more a pro iat researchers </v>
<v Speaker 2>who developed the test have admitted to </v>

32
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:41.791
<v Speaker 2>that publicly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though they haven't stressed it </v>

33
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:41.791
<v Speaker 2>nearly to the degree they should have.</v>

34
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:43.690
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sciences is not settled and is being</v>

35
00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:48.691
<v Speaker 2>used absolutely inappropriately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can say that as a clinician </v>

36
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:52.441
<v Speaker 2>because I know that and as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychometrician I know the criteria for </v>

37
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:54.220
<v Speaker 2>using a test for a sec.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially diagnostic purposes and the,</v>

38
00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:56.770
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't even come close to what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>

39
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.960
<v Speaker 2>And then the next issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

40
00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:03.430
<v Speaker 2>where's the evidence that an anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>unconscious bias training works?</v>

41
00:02:03.431 --> 00:02:08.431
<v Speaker 2>There's no evidence and what little </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence there is suggests that it </v>

42
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:10.660
<v Speaker 2>actually has the opposite effect because</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't like being brought in front</v>

43
00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:14.290
<v Speaker 2>of a reeducation committee and having </v>
<v Speaker 2>their fundamental perceptions.</v>

44
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.660
<v Speaker 2>You see their perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even their thoughts,</v>

45
00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:20.370
<v Speaker 2>but their perceptions themselves altered</v>
<v Speaker 2>by collective Fiat.</v>

46
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.850
<v Speaker 2>It's an unbelievable honor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>

47
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.570
<v Speaker 2>We have a very engaged committee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>concise questions and concise responses </v>

48
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.570
<v Speaker 2>with the helpful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

49
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.270
<v Speaker 2>senator pro.</v>
