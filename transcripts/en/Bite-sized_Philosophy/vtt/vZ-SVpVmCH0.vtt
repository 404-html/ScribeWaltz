1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm unwilling to deny the existence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>free choice merely because I don't </v>

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.960
<v Speaker 1>understand it because it looks to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's how people are,</v>

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.050
<v Speaker 1>that's how they expect to be treated and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that societies who structure themselves </v>

4
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:20.241
<v Speaker 1>in accordance with the idea that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>have free choice actually work now that </v>

5
00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:24.831
<v Speaker 1>doesn't prove that there's free choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people have been arguing about that </v>

6
00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:24.831
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

7
00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:29.660
<v Speaker 1>but it looks to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are two possible means of </v>

8
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.361
<v Speaker 1>integration and that I think what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is feeding one or the other </v>

9
00:00:32.361 --> 00:00:37.160
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you probably choose which </v>

10
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 1>one to feed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

11
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>and I mean that's how it feels that way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me as well.</v>

12
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Like when I look at my own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're really aggravated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

14
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're aggravated with your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.160
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

16
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>or your child or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.470
<v Speaker 1>and you're feeling kind of nasty and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even know that you're in the wrong</v>

18
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.070
<v Speaker 1>and an idea comes into your head.</v>

19
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.070
<v Speaker 1>You can think I could say that and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

20
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>you could say it and you know what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do,</v>

21
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>but then you pause and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would that make it better or worse?</v>

22
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>And then maybe you go to hell with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite the thing to say.</v>

23
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 1>I've got a little story about that in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute and then you say it,</v>

24
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.330
<v Speaker 1>but you knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you knew that you took the low road,</v>

25
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.350
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know it and then you're guilty </v>

26
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.180
<v Speaker 1>about that and defensive and that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight way works because then there's</v>

27
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:32.181
<v Speaker 1>no damn way you're going to admit that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually did that and so things do </v>

28
00:01:32.181 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>go to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

29
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an ugly little idea.</v>

30
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.480
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

31
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.610
<v Speaker 1>that's relevant to the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you're playing around with </v>

32
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:47.631
<v Speaker 1>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm using cocaine because it's very </v>

33
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:52.131
<v Speaker 1>addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very interesting chemical </v>

34
00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:52.131
<v Speaker 1>because it's a dopaminergic agonist.</v>

35
00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:54.750
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what dopamine does is two things.</v>

36
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:57.240
<v Speaker 1>It makes you feel like what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is worthwhile,</v>

37
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.540
<v Speaker 1>but it also imagine that there's a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of neurocircuits that are active and </v>

38
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.221
<v Speaker 1>then they get a hit of dopamine or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do in those neurocircuits get a little </v>

39
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>bit more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

40
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:13.911
<v Speaker 1>so it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a rewarding property which is </v>

41
00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:17.031
<v Speaker 1>that it makes you feel like what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing is important and it has a </v>

42
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Speaker 1>reinforcing property which is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes neurocircuits growth.</v>

43
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.920
<v Speaker 1>So now what that means is that whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were doing just before you took </v>

44
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grows.</v>

45
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now imagine there's a bunch of </v>

46
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.650
<v Speaker 1>different things that you do just before</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take cocaine,</v>

47
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.870
<v Speaker 1>but there's a string of decisions and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>one decision point is the same for all </v>

48
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:44.001
<v Speaker 1>of those difference occurrences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that decision point is because you </v>

49
00:02:44.001 --> 00:02:46.140
<v Speaker 1>know you're in trouble and that decision</v>
<v Speaker 1>point is well to hell with it.</v>

50
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you think that each of the 200 </v>

51
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.150
<v Speaker 1>times that you take cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though you do it different places,</v>

52
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.190
<v Speaker 1>but that one thought is there all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and that thing grows because you're</v>

53
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>reinforcing it and it grows and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>grows.</v>

54
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:03.540
<v Speaker 1>And it grows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so now that's in you,</v>

55
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>that's part of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the thing that says to hell </v>

56
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

57
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.471
<v Speaker 1>so now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe that's not such a good thing </v>

58
00:03:13.471 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 1>to grow inside your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you,</v>

59
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.740
<v Speaker 1>you're addicted and they take you to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine treatment center.</v>

60
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 1>And after a week you're no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>

61
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>physiologically addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not craving.</v>

62
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a problem as long as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're there.</v>

63
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.380
<v Speaker 1>But then they take you back to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal environment and you see like </v>

64
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.380
<v Speaker 1>cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

65
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>you're a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as you see him up,</v>

66
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>that thing comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>

67
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:40.741
<v Speaker 1>you're back on the back on the to hell </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a track and that's while you're in </v>

68
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.650
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're where you will end up too.</v>

69
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>If you reinforce that particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective long enough.</v>

70
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>So that's a ken in a sense to the this </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision making process.</v>

71
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:53.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

72
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.820
<v Speaker 1>if you take the low road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that winds and it gets a little </v>

73
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.371
<v Speaker 1>stronger because everything that wins </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurologically gets a little stronger.</v>

74
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:08.641
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Darwinian competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one rule is don't practice what you </v>

75
00:04:08.641 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 1>don't want to become because you really </v>
<v Speaker 1>do become that.</v>

76
00:04:11.711 --> 00:04:16.711
<v Speaker 1>It builds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it builds itself right into your neural </v>

77
00:04:16.711 --> 00:04:19.381
<v Speaker 1>architecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the terrifying things </v>

78
00:04:19.381 --> 00:04:19.381
<v Speaker 1>about addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:04:19.381 --> 00:04:19.381
<v Speaker 1>because you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

80
00:04:19.381 --> 00:04:20.140
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

81
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>

82
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.640
<v Speaker 1>It's also kind of neurophysiological and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you build a one eyed cocaine monster in </v>

83
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 1>your head if you hit yourself enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>with something that reinforcing.</v>

84
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.920
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

85
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
