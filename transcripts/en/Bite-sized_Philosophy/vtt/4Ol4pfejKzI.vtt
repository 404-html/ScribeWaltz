1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.580
<v Speaker 1>You often mentioned disciplining </v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

2
00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:07.581
<v Speaker 1>so they behave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is your advice for making them </v>

3
00:00:07.581 --> 00:00:08.250
<v Speaker 1>behave without resorting to corporal </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment?</v>

4
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

5
00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you mean by corporal </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>

6
00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time out could be regarded as corporal </v>

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.461
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also depends very much on the age of </v>

8
00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:19.461
<v Speaker 1>the child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>at say a two year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well in my new book,</v>

10
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:27.531
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a chapter in there called don't </v>

11
00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 1>let your children do anything that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>you dislike them.</v>

12
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.480
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that I wrote a chapter </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that is because people who let </v>

13
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 1>their children do things that make them </v>
<v Speaker 1>dislike them,</v>

14
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.580
<v Speaker 1>end up disliking them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because there's a huge power </v>

15
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.951
<v Speaker 1>differential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking between adults and </v>

16
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:48.261
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you end up disliking your children </v>

17
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>because they're not behaving well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're behaving disgracefully say,</v>

18
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.440
<v Speaker 1>or they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they're challenging your position in </v>

19
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.600
<v Speaker 1>the authority hierarchy to regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>something you won't put up with.</v>

21
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you think you will,</v>

22
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary to get your disciplinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>routine straight.</v>

23
00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I would say is figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what the rules are.</v>

24
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.930
<v Speaker 1>There shouldn't be too many for two year</v>
<v Speaker 1>olds.</v>

25
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to know what no means.</v>

26
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 1>And they also have to learn as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach three,</v>

27
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.790
<v Speaker 1>not to kick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit bite or steel.</v>

28
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's easy to train a two year old.</v>

29
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:29.061
<v Speaker 1>What no means you can actually start </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a child that's only 13 months old </v>

30
00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 1>child that can cry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that or that can crawl.</v>

31
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that you have a child at </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to crawl and wants to explore </v>

32
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.400
<v Speaker 1>the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing you do,</v>

33
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.020
<v Speaker 1>if you have any senses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to get rid of most things that the </v>

34
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>child could cause a tremendous amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble with,</v>

35
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

36
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>to the things or to the child so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's reasonably safe.</v>

37
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the child is gonna wanna want </v>

38
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 1>crawl around and get into everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

39
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.570
<v Speaker 1>but maybe there are things you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want him or her to get into.</v>

40
00:01:57.571 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

41
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>what would we say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a tablecloth.</v>

42
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>And on top of the table cloth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a plant,</v>

43
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:10.491
<v Speaker 1>or maybe there's some plants on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>floor and when the child is crawling and</v>

44
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>goes off to do something that he or she </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't,</v>

45
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.890
<v Speaker 1>you can just grab his leg and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>gently but firmly and say no,</v>

46
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.310
<v Speaker 1>and the child will keep trying to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward because they're stubborn little </v>

47
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.790
<v Speaker 1>blinders and you can continue to say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you persist with saying no,</v>

48
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>then the child will eventually give up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort of go limp.</v>

49
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now and often the child will cry when </v>

50
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.591
<v Speaker 1>you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course that might make you feel </v>

51
00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:42.591
<v Speaker 1>guilty.</v>

52
00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:45.440
<v Speaker 1>But what that means is that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively brought to behavior to a </v>

53
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 1>halt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you do that 10 times,</v>

54
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.360
<v Speaker 1>you've got to watch your child and don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop them from exploring things that </v>

55
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.901
<v Speaker 1>they need to explore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you want to use this sort of thing </v>

56
00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>with judiciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can grab them by the leg and say,</v>

57
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

58
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And wait until they give up.</v>

59
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Usually they'll cry and then you can let</v>
<v Speaker 1>them go.</v>

60
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>And then soon after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that,</v>

61
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:12.001
<v Speaker 1>about 10 times soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then if you just say no with the same </v>

62
00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>tone of voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the child will generally what happens,</v>

63
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>the child will immediately cry and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

64
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>And then after about 10 repeats of no </v>
<v Speaker 1>without having the late grabbed,</v>

65
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.810
<v Speaker 1>then no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just produce stopping of the </v>

66
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.841
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's unbelievably useful because </v>

67
00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:30.690
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You train your child to understand what </v>

68
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.291
<v Speaker 1>no means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they really have free reign of the </v>

69
00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>house in some sense with relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>minimal supervision from you.</v>

70
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.120
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can learn what things they're not </v>

71
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.891
<v Speaker 1>supposed to get into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's amazing how fast children can </v>

72
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:46.291
<v Speaker 1>learn that and how fast they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>generalize to the class of things that </v>

73
00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:50.311
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't get into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't have to teach them every </v>

74
00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:50.311
<v Speaker 1>single thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can generalize very rapidly.</v>

75
00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:54.871
<v Speaker 1>That's not much different than thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also once they are capable of </v>

76
00:03:55.001 --> 00:04:00.001
<v Speaker 1>understanding what no means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an extremely potent means of </v>

77
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:02.440
<v Speaker 1>helping them regulate their behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a minimum of intervention.</v>

78
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>So that's unbelievably useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now let's say you have a two year old</v>

79
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>who's pretty contentious and two year </v>
<v Speaker 1>olds are pretty contentious.</v>

80
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Some of them in particular because both </v>
<v Speaker 1>five percent of two year olds,</v>

81
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:18.421
<v Speaker 1>most of them are male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are quite aggressive by temperament and </v>

82
00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 1>those are the ones that if you put with </v>
<v Speaker 1>other two year olds will frequently kick</v>

83
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bite or steel.</v>

84
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Not all kids are like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some are and most of them get </v>

85
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>socialized out of that by the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're about four.</v>

86
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Now let's say you have an at two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also start to experiment with </v>

87
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.610
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

88
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also with misbehaving,</v>

89
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.400
<v Speaker 1>although they can do that even younger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

90
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.850
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a two year old who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly rambunctious and who </v>

91
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.061
<v Speaker 1>decides he isn't going to listen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we use he in this example because it's </v>

92
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:47.000
<v Speaker 1>boys that are more likely to misbehave </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not,</v>

93
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not listen.</v>

94
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.310
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can pick them up and you know by the</v>

95
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:56.311
<v Speaker 1>arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you got to get your attitude right </v>

96
00:04:56.311 --> 00:04:58.950
<v Speaker 1>because you don't want to be stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to let your kid make you </v>

97
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.861
<v Speaker 1>mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when they're really little </v>

98
00:05:01.861 --> 00:05:03.390
<v Speaker 1>because you're really big and you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt them and so you gotta you gotTa </v>

99
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.390
<v Speaker 1>have a clue.</v>

100
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>That's why you want to get the rules of </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline in order,</v>

101
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>the minimum rules of discipline and why </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a strategy,</v>

102
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:13.471
<v Speaker 1>but let's say you're a two or two year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old is insisting upon doing something </v>

103
00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:17.551
<v Speaker 1>that you don't want him to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a inserting a fork into an </v>

104
00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 1>electrical outlet and you just can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that and so you can say no.</v>

105
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully you've already done the no </v>
<v Speaker 1>training that I recommended and if that </v>

106
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.391
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I recommend doing is picking the </v>

107
00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>child up by the arms and then putting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them on the steps.</v>

108
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

109
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 1>you sit there until you're ready to </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>

110
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm usually the child will sit there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the rule has to be something </v>

111
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:45.001
<v Speaker 1>like you can get up as soon as you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>ready to be a civilized human being </v>

112
00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:48.391
<v Speaker 1>again and you can refer to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own attitude during a process like </v>

113
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:48.550
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

114
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Because if the child does comply and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sits on the steps and then comes and </v>

115
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.550
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready to be good,</v>

116
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.900
<v Speaker 1>and you like them again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to be honest about this.</v>

117
00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Then you can tell that he's honest in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his decision to rejoin the civilized </v>

118
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.040
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now sometimes if you put a two year old </v>

119
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>that's particularly rambunctious on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>staircase,</v>

120
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.880
<v Speaker 1>that as soon as you let go of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>arms,</v>

121
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 1>they'll run off and that can be a game </v>
<v Speaker 1>or it can just be an act of defiance and</v>

122
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:16.811
<v Speaker 1>in that case then you go get them and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them back on the steps and you do </v>

123
00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:18.070
<v Speaker 1>that several times if necessarily if </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

124
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.080
<v Speaker 1>That becomes a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you sit on the step and you hold </v>

125
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.080
<v Speaker 1>him by the arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

126
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 1>no anger because he's just too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for God sake.</v>

127
00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:27.980
<v Speaker 1>You know you don't have to be angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is put them on the steps and hold them.</v>

128
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

129
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not letting you go until you sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and behave,</v>

130
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.080
<v Speaker 1>and so if you hold him for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll squirm and look away and so forth,</v>

131
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 1>but you can get his attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a little bit stubborn,</v>

132
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.930
<v Speaker 1>you hold them there and say you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sit there until I decide that you can</v>

133
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.080
<v Speaker 1>leave and so you hold them and he'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>squirm and.</v>

134
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.000
<v Speaker 1>But you can outwait them if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>patient,</v>

135
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:52.001
<v Speaker 1>but you got to make the time and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually he'll stop squirming and you </v>

136
00:06:52.001 --> 00:06:55.151
<v Speaker 1>can let them go and then you can sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and watch him and when you think </v>

137
00:06:55.151 --> 00:06:55.151
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:06:55.151 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 1>decided that he's going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized creature.</v>

139
00:06:57.861 --> 00:07:02.861
<v Speaker 1>Then you can say that's good and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them a pat on the head and you can </v>

140
00:07:02.861 --> 00:07:02.861
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go back and do what we're doing,</v>

141
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.190
<v Speaker 1>and the rule has to be.</v>

142
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.190
<v Speaker 1>You see that the punishment not only has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring the behavior to a halt in the </v>

143
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.470
<v Speaker 1>most merciful manner possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still effective,</v>

144
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.710
<v Speaker 1>but it also has to satisfy your need for</v>
<v Speaker 1>order and justice so that you don't </v>

145
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.451
<v Speaker 1>carry resentment and irritation about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the child's misbehavior forward with you</v>

146
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 1>because you don't want a kid yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what sort of Nice person you are.</v>

147
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.420
<v Speaker 1>You're not nearly as nice a person as </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think and no one likes to be brought</v>

148
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 1>down the authority hierarchy by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>recalcitrant two-year-old.</v>

149
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.720
<v Speaker 1>So in almost all circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those processes will suffice.</v>

150
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.440
<v Speaker 1>There's other disciplinary strategies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can use to that are more </v>

151
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:47.440
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

152
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.740
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

153
00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:53.741
<v Speaker 1>if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you want to get your child to </v>

154
00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:54.380
<v Speaker 1>go to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a really good idea.</v>

155
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:59.381
<v Speaker 1>You should set a stable bedtime for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>child and I would say if they're under </v>

156
00:07:59.381 --> 00:08:02.861
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be around eight or seven or </v>

157
00:08:02.861 --> 00:08:06.311
<v Speaker 1>something like that because you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a life and you want to have a life </v>

158
00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 1>with your wife so that you don't end up </v>
<v Speaker 1>hating your child.</v>

159
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:13.150
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things you can do if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to train your child to go to </v>

160
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.571
<v Speaker 1>bed at eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe he's not going to bed until 10 </v>

161
00:08:16.571 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 1>right now and you want to fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>

162
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:22.421
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the grocery store or a little </v>

163
00:08:22.421 --> 00:08:23.480
<v Speaker 1>convenience store and buy 10 little </v>
<v Speaker 1>gifts and it can be cheap.</v>

164
00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Kids don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not very bright,</v>

165
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:26.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can fool them,</v>

166
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:31.610
<v Speaker 1>so by 10 things that you think your kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>would like and wrap them up and then put</v>

167
00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:33.270
<v Speaker 1>them up on a shelf where he can see them</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

168
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.360
<v Speaker 1>can't get at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you say,</v>

169
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:36.500
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

170
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:38.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put you to bed at 9:30</v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight,</v>

171
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:43.930
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't get out of bed then I'm </v>

172
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:45.890
<v Speaker 1>going to give you one of these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you one of these gifts</v>

173
00:08:45.891 --> 00:08:46.370
<v Speaker 1>in the morning.</v>

174
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.620
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if the.</v>

175
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Or you can do it another way too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the child is always giving you a </v>

176
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:53.710
<v Speaker 1>rough time about getting ready for bed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and going to bed,</v>

177
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:54.080
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

178
00:08:54.081 --> 00:08:59.081
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put on your pajamas without </v>

179
00:08:59.081 --> 00:09:01.761
<v Speaker 1>fussing and you climb into bed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they'll give you one of these </v>

180
00:09:01.761 --> 00:09:02.520
<v Speaker 1>little gifts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then if that works,</v>

181
00:09:02.521 --> 00:09:05.310
<v Speaker 1>then the child can have a little gift </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's in bed at 9:30</v>

182
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 1>and then you can make it nine and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make it 8:30.</v>

183
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 1>And then you can make it eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are called.</v>

184
00:09:10.321 --> 00:09:12.330
<v Speaker 1>That's called success of approximation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

185
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:14.850
<v Speaker 1>You hit the target,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you specify the target that you want the</v>

186
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:19.260
<v Speaker 1>child to achieve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then use small rewards not too often</v>

187
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:24.470
<v Speaker 1>in order to attain that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are unbelievably effective </v>

188
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.320
<v Speaker 1>strategies and they can actually be </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty fun.</v>

189
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:30.590
<v Speaker 1>But I would say the advice to not let </v>
<v Speaker 1>your child do anything that makes you </v>

190
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 1>dislike them is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really useful.</v>

191
00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:38.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to talk this over with your </v>

192
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:40.431
<v Speaker 1>partner too so that you have your </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplinary strategies and your rules </v>

193
00:09:40.431 --> 00:09:42.630
<v Speaker 1>talked out so that you don't work at </v>
<v Speaker 1>cross purposes to one another.</v>

194
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.490
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

195
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.230
<v Speaker 1>so that's probably good enough for that.</v>
