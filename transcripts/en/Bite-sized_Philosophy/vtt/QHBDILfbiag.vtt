1
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.850
<v Speaker 1>What I like about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see the fact that the,</v>

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.250
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture of the patriarchy,</v>

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.990
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the father will say here is,</v>

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.010
<v Speaker 1>is holding the suffering individual in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his arms and that's encapsulated by </v>

5
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.050
<v Speaker 1>it's very much like the story in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinocchio where Japan Know Pinocchio </v>

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.911
<v Speaker 1>wasn't able to go down into the depths </v>
<v Speaker 1>to confront the terrible monster at the </v>

8
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 1>bottom of being without having support </v>
<v Speaker 1>from his father.</v>

9
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Even though his father ended up trapped </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the whale.</v>

10
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:32.100
<v Speaker 1>If he wouldn't have been supported to </v>
<v Speaker 1>begin with,</v>

11
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't have been able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

12
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.690
<v Speaker 1>I've really seen this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've really seen this in people.</v>

13
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a hell of a thing not to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence of your father.</v>

14
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard on people.</v>

15
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your father is someone who says to </v>

16
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.300
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it,</v>

17
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.300
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that you can do it.</v>

18
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll support you in what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that you can sort it out and </v>

19
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.581
<v Speaker 1>then acts towards you in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a gift that really almost no one </v>

20
00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>else can provide you with mothers </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously provide.</v>

21
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>I think they provide the same kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gift,</v>

22
00:00:58.441 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 1>but earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:04.791
<v Speaker 1>because the mother has to take care of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the infant when the infant is just </v>

24
00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:07.700
<v Speaker 1>completely dependent and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is Erickson's idea to Eric </v>

25
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Erickson is the mother is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the person who establishes the </v>

26
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 1>relationship that allows the developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>person to manifest trust,</v>

27
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>real truck while you're being carried </v>
<v Speaker 1>for crying out loud,</v>

28
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>you know you can be dropped and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mother is also the source of food,</v>

29
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 1>but the father seems to be something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the and I'm being.</v>

30
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm obviously parsing these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>farther apart than they can be need to </v>

31
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.511
<v Speaker 1>be because the father can play a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nurturing role in the mother </v>

32
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:32.511
<v Speaker 1>complaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraging role,</v>

33
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>but we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll keep it simple for now.</v>

34
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 1>The father seems to be the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>supports and encourages and says,</v>

35
00:01:37.171 --> 00:01:37.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

36
00:01:37.591 --> 00:01:42.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're little and small and all of that </v>

37
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:42.591
<v Speaker 1>and you're subject to destruction and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

38
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 1>and bullying and social pressure and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

39
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>But I know you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you can do it and there's a force</v>

40
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:53.421
<v Speaker 1>in that that's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people who don't have that half a </v>

41
00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:56.270
<v Speaker 1>have a hell of a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually one of the things that's </v>

42
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.001
<v Speaker 1>quite fun about doing psychotherapy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you get people who have damaged </v>

43
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>father figures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's harder with a damaged mother figure</v>

44
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>a because it's so bloody deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

45
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:08.811
<v Speaker 1>I had a client who I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought she was a remarkable </v>

46
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:09.000
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but her relationship with her mother was</v>

47
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>really disrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really,</v>

48
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>really hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said she would.</v>

49
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.770
<v Speaker 1>She.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She told me it was like something had </v>

50
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.770
<v Speaker 1>been torn out of her at an early age </v>
<v Speaker 1>that couldn't be replaced.</v>

51
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>It's ray because you just can't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's mother,</v>

52
00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard.</v>

53
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 1>You're just not there enough for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can sort of be someone surrogate</v>

54
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>father that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a role you can play later.</v>

55
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's what educators do at least to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree,</v>

56
00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:36.171
<v Speaker 1>although now they're trying to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>mothers and providing safe spaces and </v>

57
00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:39.111
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not really all that </v>

58
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:39.111
<v Speaker 1>appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that.</v>

59
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>So the father is an encouraging figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>and allows the individual,</v>

60
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:46.611
<v Speaker 1>at least in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to support the catastrophe of being </v>

61
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:48.870
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily and so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those,</v>

62
00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those images,</v>

63
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:51.990
<v Speaker 1>they're just be a brilliant beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>

64
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beyond belief.</v>
