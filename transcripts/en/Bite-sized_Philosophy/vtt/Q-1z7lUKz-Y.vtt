1
00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.370
<v Speaker 1>So God's upset because he had made man </v>
<v Speaker 1>on earth and it grieved him at his </v>

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:06.370
<v Speaker 1>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and God says,</v>

3
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.841
<v Speaker 1>I will destroy man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whom I've created from the face of the </v>

4
00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:13.271
<v Speaker 1>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both man and beast and the creeping </v>

5
00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:14.420
<v Speaker 1>thing and the fowls of the air for I </v>
<v Speaker 1>repent that I've made them.</v>

6
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.120
<v Speaker 1>But Noah found grace in the eyes of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord.</v>

7
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's an interesting thing.</v>

8
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.310
<v Speaker 1>So here what we have is the question is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole world's in chaos at this </v>

9
00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:27.770
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in this point in the story.</v>

10
00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:29.890
<v Speaker 1>And the chaos is multiple sorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

11
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.970
<v Speaker 1>it arose from the fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It rose from the emergence of self </v>

12
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.970
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It emerged.</v>

13
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Safe arose from the sins of cane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like things are not going well.</v>

14
00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:43.241
<v Speaker 1>It's multiple levels of collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's got to the point where God </v>

15
00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:46.820
<v Speaker 1>saying this is a mess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's such a mess that the whole </v>

16
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.820
<v Speaker 1>thing has to be washed away.</v>

17
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.310
<v Speaker 1>The first fall wasn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even canes collapse wasn't enough.</v>

18
00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:52.010
<v Speaker 1>We're going to just scrub the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>bloody thing clean.</v>

19
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.370
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the ultimate in traumatic </v>

20
00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.370
<v Speaker 1>collapses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

21
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you do in the face of the </v>

22
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.170
<v Speaker 1>ultimate in traumatic collapses?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is in the story.</v>

23
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.550
<v Speaker 1>So Noah is someone who finds fate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who finds favor in the eyes of God,</v>

24
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.700
<v Speaker 1>so he's like able.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something that Noaa is doing </v>

25
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.640
<v Speaker 1>right that's going to enable him to ride</v>
<v Speaker 1>out the storm.</v>

26
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.220
<v Speaker 1>And so the question here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same question.</v>

27
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to have a life where there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no storms</v>

28
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>or do you want to have a life where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can ride out the storms?</v>

29
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>That's the issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

30
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Are you behind the dikes or do you build</v>
<v Speaker 1>a boat?</v>

31
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Do you captain the boat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the same idea.</v>

32
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.030
<v Speaker 1>So the idea here is that the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>rides out the chaos is the thing that </v>

33
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 1>builds and captains the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's another dominance hierarchy idea.</v>

34
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 1>What should be at the top?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

35
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 1>the top of something that doesn't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>flooded out as well.</v>

36
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 1>What should be at the top?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>it's to be the boat builder and to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the captain of the boat,</v>

38
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>it's not to be hidden from the flood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>

39
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.790
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

40
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

41
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>here's something to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>

42
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.680
<v Speaker 1>identity politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what we're up to our neck</v>

43
00:01:59.681 --> 00:02:00.610
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

44
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.180
<v Speaker 1>are you who you are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I box you?</v>

45
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you accept that as an identity?</v>

46
00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>So I could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of ways.</v>

47
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>You're male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Asia,</v>

48
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

49
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.710
<v Speaker 1>There's things about you that I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>derive because of your putative </v>

50
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.341
<v Speaker 1>membership in a set of different groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with doing that is that the </v>

51
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>number of groups that I can assign </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube is without.</v>

52
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:27.321
<v Speaker 1>And so I have to pick arbitrary groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>to assign you to and you can accept that</v>

53
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 1>if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no evidence that those are </v>

54
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.581
<v Speaker 1>the proper canonical groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe you're happy about that </v>

55
00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:37.581
<v Speaker 1>because now you've been assigned </v>
<v Speaker 1>membership in a group and that's your </v>

56
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:37.581
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

57
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

58
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens when that identity is blown</v>

59
00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:45.420
<v Speaker 1>into pieces?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then what?</v>

60
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

61
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.680
<v Speaker 1>here's the answer to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the answer that's embedded </v>

62
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.200
<v Speaker 1>in the story of Noah.</v>

63
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>If you want it withstand chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to be who you are or do you </v>

64
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>want to be the thing that changes who </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are constantly.</v>

65
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>That's the question and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

66
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:14.521
<v Speaker 1>That's the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a categorical difference in </v>

67
00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you who you are or are you the thing</v>

68
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:20.431
<v Speaker 1>that could continually be more than you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are and that's the thing that isn't the </v>

69
00:03:20.431 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 1>stable identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the initial state.</v>

70
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>It's also not the state of being in </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos that nihilistic state,</v>

71
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:31.981
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not even the state of </v>

72
00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 1>reformulation that occurs after you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone through the process.</v>

73
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.010
<v Speaker 1>It's the state of continually going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the process so you can identify </v>

74
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 1>with the thing that trends you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>identify,</v>

75
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.640
<v Speaker 1>identify with the thing that you are or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can identify with the thing that </v>

76
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>transforms who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

77
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.660
<v Speaker 1>and that's the same as the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjugating itself to the individual </v>

78
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.020
<v Speaker 1>because the individual is the thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>transforms the state and what the state </v>

79
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.681
<v Speaker 1>should do the states necessarily because</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously it organizes all of us into </v>

80
00:03:58.681 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 1>peaceful cooperation and competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the states necessary.</v>

81
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the state the highest good?</v>

82
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

83
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>it can't be because it's old and dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>and blind,</v>

84
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 1>and so if the state becomes the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

85
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 1>then you're occupied by the spirit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's old and dad and blind.</v>

86
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not only not good for you because</v>

87
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:23.101
<v Speaker 1>then you're old and dead and blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also bad for the state because </v>

88
00:04:23.101 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 1>as soon as the state gets old and dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>and blind,</v>

89
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 1>God gets unhappy with it and the chaos </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes in and washes it away.</v>

90
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 1>So it seems like a bad solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the proper solution?</v>

91
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.560
<v Speaker 1>You subordinate your group identity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the identity that transforms your </v>

92
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.560
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

93
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.450
<v Speaker 1>And this state subordinates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's power to the vision and </v>

94
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 1>articulation of the individual because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what revives the state.</v>

95
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.120
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what these stories are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to stumble towards.</v>

96
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Roughly speaking.</v>
