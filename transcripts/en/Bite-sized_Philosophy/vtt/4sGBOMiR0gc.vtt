1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.530
<v Speaker 1>It's a great thing to know with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like in your relationships here,</v>

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.630
<v Speaker 1>here's the key to a good relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the only one,</v>

3
00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:11.160
<v Speaker 1>but watch your person carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully,</v>

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.430
<v Speaker 1>carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and whenever they do something that you </v>

5
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.711
<v Speaker 1>would like them to do more of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell them that that was really good and </v>

6
00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:22.821
<v Speaker 1>mean it and it's not manipulative </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if it's manipulative it won't </v>

7
00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:22.821
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you have to say,</v>

8
00:00:22.821 --> 00:00:24.030
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad you did that.</v>

9
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:29.031
<v Speaker 1>Did you have to be precise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what you just did that I thought </v>

10
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>was great and Oh boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so nice that you've noticed.</v>

11
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe they could notice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

12
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that 20 times and the person will</v>

13
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:39.831
<v Speaker 1>be like the rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just pushing the lever for </v>

14
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:39.831
<v Speaker 1>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

15
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:39.831
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

16
00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's skinner established this bf skinner</v>

17
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.860
<v Speaker 1>noticed this a long time ago.</v>

18
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Reward is intensely useful in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>modifying behavior,</v>

19
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:53.271
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is is that it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to notice when things are going </v>

20
00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

21
00:00:54.091 --> 00:00:59.091
<v Speaker 1>Because you're kind of prime to notice </v>
<v Speaker 1>when things are going wrong and so you </v>

22
00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:02.781
<v Speaker 1>use threat and punishment more often as </v>
<v Speaker 1>agents of of shaping the people that </v>

23
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>you're around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you know when everything's going</v>

24
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:07.170
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

25
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's going right.</v>

26
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>It turns to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just assume it and that's not good.</v>

27
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 1>That's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to pay attention and if the.</v>

28
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>If you're a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your children,</v>

29
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:21.720
<v Speaker 1>your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your whoever,</v>

30
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 1>your mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your sister,</v>

31
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.480
<v Speaker 1>if you want them to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to rectify your </v>

32
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.801
<v Speaker 1>relationships with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying to do this in a </v>

33
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:33.801
<v Speaker 1>manipulative wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't work,</v>

34
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:38.420
<v Speaker 1>but if they do something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoting harmony and peace and </v>

35
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>goodwill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like attend to it.</v>

36
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Tell them that you noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's so useful and you have to</v>

37
00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>get rid of your grudges and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>resentment to do that,</v>

38
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you don't want you to kind of </v>

39
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.120
<v Speaker 1>mad at your sister and then you know she</v>
<v Speaker 1>does something good.</v>

40
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>You think there is no god damn way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to reward you for that.</v>

41
00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>So you ignore her when she does </v>
<v Speaker 1>something good.</v>

42
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's brilliant.</v>

43
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>That is because then you've just </v>
<v Speaker 1>punished her for doing what you want.</v>

44
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 1>And people do that with their kids all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

45
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they let the kids dominate them.</v>

46
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Then they get resentful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the kid will run up to them to show</v>

47
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>them something that's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular and they'll,</v>

48
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.140
<v Speaker 1>they're not happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll say,</v>

49
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.840
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

50
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

51
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:14.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm working.</v>

52
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little kid has all sad about that and </v>

53
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.670
<v Speaker 1>he's just learned something so.</v>

54
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>And it's not perhaps what you want them </v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn.</v>

55
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.820
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to keep your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your relationship with your children </v>

56
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.271
<v Speaker 1>pristine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you can't hold a </v>

57
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:35.901
<v Speaker 1>grudge or resent them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you have to help </v>

58
00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:36.690
<v Speaker 1>them learn how to behave so that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>liked them.</v>

59
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.140
<v Speaker 1>And that way if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like them and you're kind of </v>

60
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>sensible and maybe your partner also </v>
<v Speaker 1>likes them.</v>

61
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a consensus going there,</v>

62
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.270
<v Speaker 1>there's a reasonable possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people will actually liked them </v>

63
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including other children.</v>

64
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>And then the world will open up to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.760
<v Speaker 1>then you'll bring them to people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>houses and the people will actually </v>

66
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>smile at them and them a pat on the head</v>
<v Speaker 1>and instead of thinking,</v>

67
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:02.940
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Brad's coming to visit again,</v>

68
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what it will break this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

69
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's just a horrible thing for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your child to experience repetitively in</v>

70
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:15.781
<v Speaker 1>situation after situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All they learned is that adults have a </v>

71
00:03:15.781 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>false smile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're really lying all the time.</v>

72
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a bit of hell.</v>

73
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of children who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped in that.</v>

74
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:27.541
<v Speaker 1>It's really awful to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see kids like that when I walked </v>

75
00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:27.541
<v Speaker 1>down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>it's like their little doomed things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there they are and you know,</v>

77
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.630
<v Speaker 1>they're screwed in 15 different ways and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way out of it.</v>

78
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.660
<v Speaker 1>It's really awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would not recommend that you do </v>

79
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.771
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's better to notice that you're a bit </v>

80
00:03:43.771 --> 00:03:45.841
<v Speaker 1>of a monster or a lot of a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And notice that you are much happier </v>

81
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:52.171
<v Speaker 1>with the people around you when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>behave in accordance with reasonable </v>

82
00:03:52.171 --> 00:03:55.531
<v Speaker 1>social social norms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you actually feel genuinely </v>

83
00:03:55.531 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 1>connected to them and you want to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>on their behalf so that everything works</v>

84
00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:02.971
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you think you're a good person </v>

85
00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>and that you'd never do anything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was harmful to your children,</v>

86
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:08.461
<v Speaker 1>then you can just forget about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'll never take it seriously </v>

87
00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:08.461
<v Speaker 1>enough to actually learn.</v>
