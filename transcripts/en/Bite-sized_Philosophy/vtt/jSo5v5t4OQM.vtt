1
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now now down to cognitive ability.</v>

2
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you conceptualize intelligence?</v>

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a major problem because your </v>

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.850
<v Speaker 1>initial conceptualization determines in </v>
<v Speaker 1>part the strategies that you're going to</v>

5
00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:23.800
<v Speaker 1>use to investigate intelligence and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say when you,</v>

6
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.950
<v Speaker 1>when you pair a sentence down to what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

7
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.220
<v Speaker 1>the sentence is problematic because part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it is a question about if and how </v>

8
00:00:33.941 --> 00:00:36.370
<v Speaker 1>such a thing might manifest itself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

9
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>So there's a fact out there that are set</v>
<v Speaker 1>of facts that corresponds to </v>

10
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.700
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other problem is,</v>

11
00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:47.701
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean when you say </v>

12
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:47.701
<v Speaker 1>intelligence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you kind of have to nail that down.</v>

13
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:52.561
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to have a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>about intelligence that doesn't go </v>

14
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:56.611
<v Speaker 1>entirely astray and so you've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a definitional problem as </v>

15
00:00:56.611 --> 00:01:00.400
<v Speaker 1>well as an empirical problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there have been,</v>

16
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.530
<v Speaker 1>and this was especially true in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>

17
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>people have been studying intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq intelligence since the 19 twenties </v>

18
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a very well established branch </v>

19
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.141
<v Speaker 1>of psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I have to tell you </v>

20
00:01:16.141 --> 00:01:18.391
<v Speaker 1>about Iq research is that if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>buy Iq research,</v>

21
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 1>you might as well throw away all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of psychology and the reason for </v>

22
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 1>that is that</v>

23
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.180
<v Speaker 1>the psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

24
00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:31.181
<v Speaker 1>who developed intelligence testing were </v>
<v Speaker 1>among the early psychologists who </v>

25
00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:35.021
<v Speaker 1>instantiated the statistical techniques </v>
<v Speaker 1>that all psychologists use to verify and</v>

26
00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:40.151
<v Speaker 1>test all of their hypotheses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you ended up throwing the baby out </v>

27
00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:43.601
<v Speaker 1>with the bathwater and the ICU.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have defined intelligence in a </v>

28
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
<v Speaker 1>more stringent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stringent and accurate way than we've </v>

29
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.860
<v Speaker 1>been able to define almost any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological construct.</v>

30
00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:54.980
<v Speaker 1>And so if you toss out the one that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>most well defined,</v>

31
00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:57.290
<v Speaker 1>then you're kind of stuck with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of what are you going to do with</v>

32
00:01:57.291 --> 00:02:02.291
<v Speaker 1>all the ones that you have leftover that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are nowhere near as well defined or as </v>

33
00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:04.610
<v Speaker 1>well measured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or as or as or.</v>

34
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.820
<v Speaker 1>Or who's predictive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Validity is much less than it has been </v>

35
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.290
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated with much less vigor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>clarity anyways.</v>

36
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:17.291
<v Speaker 1>Despite all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have posited a number of </v>

37
00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:19.060
<v Speaker 1>different intelligences and reasonably </v>
<v Speaker 1>so because there's.</v>

38
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.190
<v Speaker 1>If you think of intelligence as that </v>
<v Speaker 1>which might move you forward </v>

39
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.991
<v Speaker 1>successfully in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's a fair number of </v>

40
00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:32.740
<v Speaker 1>phenomena that are associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals that might fit into that </v>

41
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.831
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have people have made these </v>

42
00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:38.410
<v Speaker 1>distinctions.</v>

43
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Bob Sternberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

44
00:02:42.031 --> 00:02:47.031
<v Speaker 1>is distinguished between practical </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus analytical intelligence and he </v>

45
00:02:47.031 --> 00:02:51.291
<v Speaker 1>kind of thinks of practical as like </v>
<v Speaker 1>street smarts and has attempted to </v>

46
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:55.341
<v Speaker 1>dissociate that from the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>analytical intelligence that that </v>

47
00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>characterizes more straight Iq research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's done it successfully </v>

48
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 1>as well at all and since the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>

49
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.870
<v Speaker 1>interest in his practical intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>has declined precipitously because when </v>

50
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>it is matched head to head with standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq intelligence,</v>

51
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>the Iq intelligence seats up pull the </v>
<v Speaker 1>variability.</v>

52
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>What's really happened as far as I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell so far is that when we're trying to</v>

53
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:22.591
<v Speaker 1>predict people's course through life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iq does a very good job and then one of </v>

54
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>the traits does a very good job as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is conscientiousness,</v>

55
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.520
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't do as good a job as Iq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

56
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>that partly might be because we can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure conscientiousness very well.</v>

57
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.750
<v Speaker 1>We're stuck with self reports or maybe I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could gather peer reports about you or I</v>

58
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:44.751
<v Speaker 1>could gather your parents reports about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your teachers reports and each of those </v>

59
00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:48.780
<v Speaker 1>seems to pick up a little bit more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pattern because you know yourself,</v>

60
00:03:48.781 --> 00:03:52.320
<v Speaker 1>but other people know you differently </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you know yourself and there's still</v>

61
00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:57.321
<v Speaker 1>some accuracy in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get multiple rater reports of </v>

62
00:03:57.321 --> 00:03:57.930
<v Speaker 1>something like conscientiousness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll up.</v>

63
00:03:57.931 --> 00:04:00.750
<v Speaker 1>It's predictive validity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the final analysis,</v>

64
00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:05.751
<v Speaker 1>the best you seem to be able to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with conscientiousness is about a point </v>

65
00:04:05.751 --> 00:04:06.240
<v Speaker 1>four correlation with longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>

66
00:04:06.241 --> 00:04:11.241
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with Iq in complex jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can probably get point five and </v>

67
00:04:11.241 --> 00:04:14.280
<v Speaker 1>maybe point six and so point five is 25 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the variance.</v>

68
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.920
<v Speaker 1>You got a square it point six is 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>

69
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.210
<v Speaker 1>36 percent of the variance and point </v>
<v Speaker 1>four is 16 percent of the variance.</v>

70
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.200
<v Speaker 1>So even at the low end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say high end for conscientiousness</v>

71
00:04:25.201 --> 00:04:30.201
<v Speaker 1>is point four or 16 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Low End for Iq is point five or 25 </v>

72
00:04:30.511 --> 00:04:35.511
<v Speaker 1>percent low end estimates of Iq make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>one and a half times more powerful than </v>

73
00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:39.921
<v Speaker 1>the high end estimates of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and I think that's </v>

74
00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:39.921
<v Speaker 1>about right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd think,</v>

75
00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:44.271
<v Speaker 1>why do we even have to debate this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so bloody obvious to me </v>

76
00:04:44.271 --> 00:04:45.420
<v Speaker 1>that intelligence is a major predictor </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life success.</v>

77
00:04:45.421 --> 00:04:50.421
<v Speaker 1>I mean you people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've measured the Iq of University of </v>

78
00:04:50.421 --> 00:04:50.421
<v Speaker 1>Toronto people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:04:50.421 --> 00:04:53.580
<v Speaker 1>people in this room who have an Iq of </v>
<v Speaker 1>less than 120 are rare.</v>

80
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

81
00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.170
<v Speaker 1>Well smart people go to university now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that actually a contentious </v>

82
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.371
<v Speaker 1>statement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What shouldn't be a contentious </v>

83
00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:04.371
<v Speaker 1>statement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's self evident.</v>

84
00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:08.001
<v Speaker 1>Universities were actually set up so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that smart people could expand their </v>

85
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:08.250
<v Speaker 1>abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they were there.</v>

86
00:05:08.251 --> 00:05:13.251
<v Speaker 1>And you're selected on the basis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>assessments that are essentially there </v>

87
00:05:13.251 --> 00:05:13.260
<v Speaker 1>to assess something like intelligence.</v>

88
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

89
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.830
<v Speaker 1>that will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will,</v>

90
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 1>that is part of the controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it reasonable?</v>

91
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Speaker 1>And this is a measurement issue and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why we're.</v>

92
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.160
<v Speaker 1>That's why I've been instructing you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree in psychometrics because we </v>

93
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 1>actually know how to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know how to answer that question,</v>

94
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.760
<v Speaker 1>so let's take a look at how at how </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence has been assessed and why,</v>

95
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 1>and then you can make up your own mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

96
00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:49.351
<v Speaker 1>Here's some of the examples of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of intelligence and so then the </v>

97
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:50.590
<v Speaker 1>question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

98
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.740
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to have a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of intelligence?</v>

99
00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Would would form a and form b be </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely uncorrelated,</v>

100
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:03.250
<v Speaker 1>like extroversion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in neuroticism or would they be </v>

101
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.561
<v Speaker 1>slightly correlated or would they be </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly correlated and then you might </v>

102
00:06:05.561 --> 00:06:05.561
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

103
00:06:05.561 --> 00:06:09.010
<v Speaker 1>how highly correlated did they have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be before they're the same thing or how </v>

104
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:14.351
<v Speaker 1>uncorrelated did they have to be before </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're different things and actually </v>

105
00:06:14.351 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that comes down to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like practical utility.</v>

106
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine I'm trying to figure out how </v>

107
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.940
<v Speaker 1>well you'll do in university and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure one thing and it's correlated at</v>

108
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:25.220
<v Speaker 1>point seven with another thing I measure</v>
<v Speaker 1>about you.</v>

109
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Then I might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

110
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 1>are those two things the same or </v>
<v Speaker 1>different?</v>

111
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:32.921
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty highly correlated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your high in one means you're going to </v>

112
00:06:32.921 --> 00:06:35.231
<v Speaker 1>be high in the other while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what is there any utility in </v>

113
00:06:35.231 --> 00:06:39.371
<v Speaker 1>measuring both things and the way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure that out actually is you do it </v>

114
00:06:39.371 --> 00:06:40.430
<v Speaker 1>statistically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we take the target,</v>

115
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:43.370
<v Speaker 1>which might be your performance across </v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

116
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Then we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

117
00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:49.541
<v Speaker 1>can we predict your performance across </v>
<v Speaker 1>university better by using one variable </v>

118
00:06:49.541 --> 00:06:54.280
<v Speaker 1>or two variables?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we would enter them both into a </v>

119
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 1>regression equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All a regression equation does.</v>

120
00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.460
<v Speaker 1>It's quite simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're trying to predict the target </v>

121
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.090
<v Speaker 1>and the regression age regression </v>
<v Speaker 1>equation tells you how well you can </v>

122
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.130
<v Speaker 1>predict that target.</v>

123
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.340
<v Speaker 1>If you know another fact now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it gets a little complicated </v>

124
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:14.150
<v Speaker 1>because that's a correlation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How well you can predict be with a well.</v>

125
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.940
<v Speaker 1>A regression will say how much you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>predict.</v>

126
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.970
<v Speaker 1>See if you know a and B or a and B and c</v>
<v Speaker 1>and d and e because you can use multiple</v>

127
00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:27.761
<v Speaker 1>predictors and you can weight them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it might be two times a plus one </v>

128
00:07:27.761 --> 00:07:32.081
<v Speaker 1>times b equals c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's all a regression equation </v>

129
00:07:32.081 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 1>does is just multiplication and </v>
<v Speaker 1>addition.</v>

130
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very straightforward.</v>

131
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.650
<v Speaker 1>And so two variables are sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 1>different functionally if you can use </v>

132
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 1>both of them simultaneously to predict </v>
<v Speaker 1>something of interest.</v>

133
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.030
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tool like approach.</v>

134
00:07:44.031 --> 00:07:46.850
<v Speaker 1>This is how the psychometricians do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is something real.</v>

135
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>

136
00:07:47.781 --> 00:07:49.130
<v Speaker 1>If you can measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>measure it,</v>

137
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.810
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it helps you predict that's,</v>

138
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.850
<v Speaker 1>that's how it's defined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you might say,</v>

139
00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:57.851
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are are there these multiple </v>

140
00:07:57.851 --> 00:07:57.851
<v Speaker 1>intelligences?</v>

141
00:07:57.851 --> 00:07:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first question would be,</v>

142
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by are there?</v>

143
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.380
<v Speaker 1>And that answer to that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

144
00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:06.650
<v Speaker 1>let's specify the question since we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be scientific about it.</v>

145
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.200
<v Speaker 1>Let's predict how well people do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

146
00:08:09.201 --> 00:08:12.050
<v Speaker 1>We'll start with the assumption that </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

147
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.270
<v Speaker 1>if intelligence isn't associated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>university success,</v>

148
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 1>then you're probably not talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

149
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Now you could argue that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

150
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.030
<v Speaker 1>Because you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

151
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:25.370
<v Speaker 1>intelligence has nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>university success,</v>

152
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 1>but that's a definitional matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to agree to begin with.</v>

153
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Is it reasonable to start with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that intelligence and </v>

154
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.290
<v Speaker 1>university success share something in </v>
<v Speaker 1>common?</v>

155
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to be daft to,</v>

156
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:42.140
<v Speaker 1>to deny that initial proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you could,</v>

157
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:48.410
<v Speaker 1>because you could say it was privileged </v>
<v Speaker 1>or socioeconomic status or or or,</v>

158
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.430
<v Speaker 1>or any number of sociological phenomena </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of those are obviously relevant</v>

159
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.200
<v Speaker 1>social class for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

160
00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a higher social class and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all things being equal,</v>

161
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.970
<v Speaker 1>intelligence included,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a higher social class,</v>

162
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:05.520
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to go to university </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you are if you're in a lower social</v>

163
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's other,</v>

164
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:11.990
<v Speaker 1>there's other factors that are going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence whether or not you do well in </v>

165
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.411
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to assume that one of </v>

166
00:09:15.411 --> 00:09:15.411
<v Speaker 1>them might be intelligence.</v>

167
00:09:15.411 --> 00:09:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Well then you would ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

168
00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.510
<v Speaker 1>if you measured social intelligence,</v>

169
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 1>so that's what do they call that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social Intelligence.</v>

170
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional intelligence,</v>

171
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.650
<v Speaker 1>which does not exist by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emotional intelligence,</v>

172
00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.630
<v Speaker 1>moral intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>linguistic musical,</v>

173
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:31.740
<v Speaker 1>logical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematical,</v>

174
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:33.270
<v Speaker 1>spacial body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinesthetic,</v>

175
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal and intrapersonal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All different forms of intelligence.</v>

176
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to answer the question of whether </v>

177
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.391
<v Speaker 1>they exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do first is pick a target </v>

178
00:09:44.391 --> 00:09:47.810
<v Speaker 1>prediction of university performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you make a measure for each of </v>

179
00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.201
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you test to see if the measure </v>

180
00:09:51.201 --> 00:09:52.560
<v Speaker 1>measured the same thing across multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>instances within the same person.</v>

181
00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:55.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a reliability tests because what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hell good is your ruler.</v>

182
00:09:55.501 --> 00:10:00.501
<v Speaker 1>If it stretches when you use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to measure the same thing </v>

183
00:10:00.501 --> 00:10:00.660
<v Speaker 1>multiple times and then you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

184
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:05.780
<v Speaker 1>we'll take all these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligences measured the way we've </v>

185
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:10.041
<v Speaker 1>decided to measure them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing we'll do is see how </v>

186
00:10:10.041 --> 00:10:10.041
<v Speaker 1>highly correlated they are because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're complete,</v>

187
00:10:10.041 --> 00:10:11.340
<v Speaker 1>two of them are completely correlated.</v>

188
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Then you have one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to because that's </v>

189
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.800
<v Speaker 1>virtually the definition of one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of two.</v>

190
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:22.010
<v Speaker 1>You can factor analyze them and see if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can pull out what's common across </v>

191
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.911
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing because then you </v>

192
00:10:25.911 --> 00:10:25.911
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

193
00:10:25.911 --> 00:10:27.420
<v Speaker 1>intelligence is what's common across all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the measures of these intelligences.</v>

194
00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a fact.</v>

195
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.160
<v Speaker 1>You have to decide if you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree with it,</v>

196
00:10:32.161 --> 00:10:35.250
<v Speaker 1>but that if you were going to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd use a factor analysis.</v>

197
00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:35.970
<v Speaker 1>You'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

198
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:38.910
<v Speaker 1>if someone was more likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>musical,</v>

199
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:44.060
<v Speaker 1>if they were also high in linguistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability and more likely to be logical </v>

200
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.540
<v Speaker 1>and mathematically inclined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they had a high spatial ability,</v>

201
00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:50.541
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'd be hypothesizing that there </v>

202
00:10:50.541 --> 00:10:52.971
<v Speaker 1>was one factor behind all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifestations that somehow similar and </v>

203
00:10:53.281 --> 00:10:58.281
<v Speaker 1>maybe there wouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you take all your measures and </v>

204
00:10:58.281 --> 00:11:01.101
<v Speaker 1>you put them in something like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple regression analysis and you'd </v>

205
00:11:01.101 --> 00:11:03.060
<v Speaker 1>predict your target university </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance and then maybe you'd say,</v>

206
00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:03.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

207
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Let's not just use university </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>

208
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Let's use junior high performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high school performance,</v>

209
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:15.470
<v Speaker 1>university performance and job success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then let's say that the only things </v>

210
00:11:15.781 --> 00:11:19.740
<v Speaker 1>that predict success across all of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>categories and that are the same,</v>

211
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:21.780
<v Speaker 1>we're going to define as intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

212
00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:23.610
<v Speaker 1>that's basically how you end up with Iq.</v>

213
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:32.060
<v Speaker 1>You could say that Iq is what's common </v>
<v Speaker 1>across all possible sets of of </v>

214
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.930
<v Speaker 1>intelligence tests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now people are going to debate that </v>

215
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.750
<v Speaker 1>because you still have to define what </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutes a test,</v>

216
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:45.020
<v Speaker 1>but the way the psychometricians have </v>
<v Speaker 1>managed it and have taken care of this </v>

217
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:45.120
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to say,</v>

218
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to.</v>

219
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.490
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to define everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we measure as intelligence,</v>

220
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.220
<v Speaker 1>so extroverted people are more socially </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluent.</v>

221
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.220
<v Speaker 1>We're going to call that intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

222
00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:00.540
<v Speaker 1>we're going to call that personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to call that extroversion </v>

223
00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:00.540
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to call stress </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerance.</v>

224
00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:01.240
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

225
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.090
<v Speaker 1>if you can tolerate more stress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more intelligent.</v>

226
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

227
00:12:04.661 --> 00:12:06.130
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that isn't how we've defined it.</v>

228
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.740
<v Speaker 1>We're going to define that as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>lower in neuroticism.</v>

229
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:11.320
<v Speaker 1>If you're cooperative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more intelligent.</v>

230
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:13.300
<v Speaker 1>That's emotional intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

231
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:15.580
<v Speaker 1>what you're less intelligent if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive.</v>

232
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

233
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 1>so we parsed that off to agreeableness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then the question might be,</v>

234
00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:23.500
<v Speaker 1>is there anything left of these so </v>
<v Speaker 1>called intelligences?</v>

235
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Once you control for personality and Iq </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the answer is no.</v>

236
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing left of them,</v>

237
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.720
<v Speaker 1>and the people who keep pushing these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas keep trying to push them because </v>

238
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.960
<v Speaker 1>they don't like the idea of real </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual differences,</v>

239
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:43.140
<v Speaker 1>and to me that's just a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sticking your damn head in the sand </v>

240
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.470
<v Speaker 1>because it's obvious here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a child,</v>

241
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:49.390
<v Speaker 1>you want the child to have an Iq of 65 </v>
<v Speaker 1>or 145 decide,</v>

242
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:50.980
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're all going to vote.</v>

243
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:56.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think any one of you is going to </v>

244
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.691
<v Speaker 1>vote to have a child with an Iq of 65,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that child is going to have a hard time </v>

245
00:12:57.691 --> 00:13:00.340
<v Speaker 1>developing even linguistic ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're never going to learn to read,</v>

246
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're never going to leave home in all</v>

247
00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 1>likelihood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So which child are you going to pick?</v>

248
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so do you believe in intelligence or </v>

249
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:11.130
<v Speaker 1>not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

250
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:11.130
<v Speaker 1>obviously if you have any sense.</v>
