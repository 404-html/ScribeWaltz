1
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get points for that if you stay,</v>

2
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is of course a really good point.</v>

3
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have more abilities to get to a </v>

4
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.930
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that is also like,</v>

5
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.920
<v Speaker 1>it's also assuming that you will always </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to a solution.</v>

6
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

7
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

8
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.870
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

9
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Spend a winning solution that will keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>them</v>

10
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.850
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

11
00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:36.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there used to be before the divorce laws</v>

12
00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:41.041
<v Speaker 2>were really liberalized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were there you could sue for </v>

13
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.711
<v Speaker 2>irreconcilable differences and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes people do find themselves </v>

14
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:48.031
<v Speaker 2>in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like one person wants children and </v>

15
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:48.790
<v Speaker 2>the other person doesn't like that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tough one.</v>

16
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.480
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough one to negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>

17
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly not saying that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you lock yourself into a,</v>

18
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.230
<v Speaker 2>like two cats in a barrel that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will make you solve your problems </v>

19
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.740
<v Speaker 2>because problems are hard to solve and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you can't solve them.</v>

20
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.520
<v Speaker 2>I was just pointing out what the cost </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

21
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:13.521
<v Speaker 2>of leaving the back door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the cost of leaving the back door </v>

22
00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:13.630
<v Speaker 2>open ends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a big cost.</v>

23
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.770
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

24
00:01:14.771 --> 00:01:19.771
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I see too is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's identities fragment </v>

25
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:20.380
<v Speaker 2>increasingly across time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

26
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that you have as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>age is something like the continuity of </v>

27
00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:27.880
<v Speaker 2>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

28
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

29
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.490
<v Speaker 2>you have someone that you're with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've tied your story together with </v>

30
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.490
<v Speaker 2>theirs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have children,</v>

31
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.810
<v Speaker 2>maybe they have children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's this continual payoff,</v>

32
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in quality that you obtained from </v>

33
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 2>staying within that frame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you can jump out of that.</v>

34
00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:49.420
<v Speaker 2>And I suppose to some degree that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>provides freedom.</v>

35
00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:51.580
<v Speaker 2>But it isn't obvious to me that it does </v>
<v Speaker 2>that for people</v>

36
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.130
<v Speaker 1>only that one specific relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's my email.</v>

37
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.430
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

38
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.490
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also the case that sequential </v>

39
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.921
<v Speaker 2>relationships are unlikely to be that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So look,</v>

40
00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:10.100
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

41
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely not making a utopian case</v>

42
00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:15.260
<v Speaker 2>for marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

43
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I would like to hear the case for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice from you because they think it's </v>

44
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.080
<v Speaker 1>really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

45
00:02:21.081 --> 00:02:26.081
<v Speaker 1>It says top points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time I think there are </v>

46
00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:28.160
<v Speaker 1>relationships that are wanting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

47
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.640
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's the case,</v>

48
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.950
<v Speaker 1>then insistence on a can cannot be good.</v>

49
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>

50
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.910
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely the alternative </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>

51
00:02:39.911 --> 00:02:43.660
<v Speaker 2>And of course there are strong things to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be said on both sides,</v>

52
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 2>but see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some,</v>

53
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.640
<v Speaker 2>there's some additional problems with </v>
<v Speaker 2>divorce that people don't really grasp </v>

54
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.880
<v Speaker 2>when they're young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

55
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 2>that you can be divorced once you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>

56
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of a stupid idea because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't.</v>

57
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

58
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.370
<v Speaker 2>you can find a limited substitute for </v>
<v Speaker 2>your initial freedom.</v>

59
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.340
<v Speaker 2>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have kids and you try to get </v>

60
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.041
<v Speaker 2>divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probability that that's going to </v>

61
00:03:20.041 --> 00:03:20.041
<v Speaker 2>demolish your life is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very high.</v>

62
00:03:20.041 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's incredibly expensive.</v>

63
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 2>So one or both of you is going to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of that poor and</v>

64
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.130
<v Speaker 2>your market value has declined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you're the woman who takes the</v>

65
00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:37.131
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your market value has declined </v>

66
00:03:37.131 --> 00:03:37.131
<v Speaker 2>radically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be poorer.</v>

67
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.310
<v Speaker 2>The man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just a screwed because he is now an</v>

68
00:03:41.311 --> 00:03:44.130
<v Speaker 2>indentured servant and there's no escape</v>
<v Speaker 2>from it.</v>

69
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not so bad if you can negotiate</v>

70
00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:50.400
<v Speaker 2>a peaceful separation and some people </v>
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>

71
00:03:50.401 --> 00:03:52.950
<v Speaker 2>but lots of times if you have a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>

72
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.310
<v Speaker 2>it's not like negotiating and peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 2>separation is all that easy,</v>

73
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.850
<v Speaker 2>but if you're at each other's throats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good luck to you.</v>

74
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it's roughly equivalent to </v>
<v Speaker 2>having nonfatal cancer.</v>

75
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.380
<v Speaker 2>It is not pleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a 10 year process.</v>

76
00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:10.320
<v Speaker 2>Fifteen year process will cost you </v>
<v Speaker 2>$250,000</v>

77
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.590
<v Speaker 2>and it'll tear a big chunk out of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and also it will really disrupt </v>

78
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.910
<v Speaker 2>your relationship with your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

79
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.160
<v Speaker 2>you bring kids into a step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parent family,</v>

80
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.000
<v Speaker 2>they do not do as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Step parents are not as good as parents,</v>

81
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:26.460
<v Speaker 2>as biological parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the data on that is clear.</v>

82
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Now obviously there are exceptions </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are terrible biological </v>

83
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.370
<v Speaker 2>parents and there are wonderful step </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents,</v>

84
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.540
<v Speaker 2>but if you look in aggregate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that easy to care for children.</v>

85
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.370
<v Speaker 2>You need to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can binding you to them.</v>

86
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
<v Speaker 2>And if there's someone else's children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly they get in the way of the person</v>

87
00:04:47.011 --> 00:04:47.790
<v Speaker 2>that you love.</v>

88
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.390
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

89
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm,</v>

90
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.300
<v Speaker 2>let's say you have a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be right out.</v>

91
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.840
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you have a child and I want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go out with you every second you spend </v>

92
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.390
<v Speaker 2>with that child is a second you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend with me and,</v>

93
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.870
<v Speaker 2>and there's going to be a price for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

94
00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:07.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I have a child,</v>

95
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.670
<v Speaker 2>you're going to feel exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

96
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.450
<v Speaker 2>You might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

97
00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:10.350
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love children.</v>

98
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:11.130
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

99
00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:12.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

100
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.790
<v Speaker 2>sure you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I doubt it.</v>

101
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.180
<v Speaker 2>You might love your child and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

102
00:05:18.181 --> 00:05:20.430
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty specific the way that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>loved children.</v>

103
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.120
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the rate of abuse for kids in step </v>

104
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.510
<v Speaker 2>parent families is way higher than it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>in biological families.</v>

105
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.980
<v Speaker 2>There's not even any comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyways.</v>
