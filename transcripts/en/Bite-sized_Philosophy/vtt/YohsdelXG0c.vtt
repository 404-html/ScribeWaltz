1
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To sort of separate,</v>

2
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.560
<v Speaker 1>you were talking about being around 300 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million people,</v>

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 1>so why is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is a group of similar size,</v>

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.170
<v Speaker 1>which is America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really face.</v>

5
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.780
<v Speaker 1>You think the right and left can talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

6
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they speak the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>language?</v>

7
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it that fragmenting occurring </v>

8
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 1>and they really are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only are they speaking different </v>

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.150
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're speaking different languages.</v>

10
00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:33.100
<v Speaker 1>It's the right way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

11
00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:34.390
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous.</v>

12
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the US worked for a long time,</v>

13
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.910
<v Speaker 1>first of all because it didn't always </v>
<v Speaker 1>have 300 million people.</v>

14
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of people to put under one </v>
<v Speaker 1>umbrella.</v>

15
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Now the utility of the American system </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it is a hierarchy,</v>

16
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's individuals,</v>

17
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towns,</v>

18
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>states underneath a somewhat loose </v>
<v Speaker 1>federal structure and that sort of.</v>

19
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.650
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a monolith where everyone has </v>

20
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.650
<v Speaker 1>to speak precisely the same language.</v>

21
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>It's got some flexibility built into its</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure because it's,</v>

22
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

23
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>it's formulated into components which </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a certain amount of autonomy and so</v>

24
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:14.781
<v Speaker 1>far that's worked sufficiently well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it will and it'll probably </v>

25
00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:15.540
<v Speaker 1>continue to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Americans are a very,</v>

26
00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:20.541
<v Speaker 1>very robust people and they've gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>through things that are analogous to </v>

27
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>what they're going through now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many times God only knows,</v>

28
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

29
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's very dangerous thing to presume</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Americans are down for the </v>

30
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.291
<v Speaker 1>count because they have an uncanny </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to rise from the ashes even </v>

31
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:36.801
<v Speaker 1>stronger than they were before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can certainly see the danger </v>

32
00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:36.801
<v Speaker 1>lurking in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

33
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.020
<v Speaker 1>that's a different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think the European state is </v>

34
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.531
<v Speaker 1>doomed because I think it grew too fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's severed that connection between</v>

35
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.630
<v Speaker 1>like there's not the proper hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

36
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.910
<v Speaker 1>of identification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

37
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Speaker 1>And people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

38
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.150
<v Speaker 1>right Brussels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who the hell are you guys?</v>

39
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.840
<v Speaker 1>Why are you making decisions for us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't agree with your decisions.</v>

40
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>And like are you sure that Greece and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany can be in the same place?</v>

41
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Because that's by no means self evident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

42
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.830
<v Speaker 1>The Germans aren't very happy about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Greeks aren't very happy about </v>

43
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.891
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the rules for making an </v>

44
00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:15.441
<v Speaker 1>organization is that it's a lot easier </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a functional organization worse </v>

45
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 1>than it is to make a dysfunctional </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization better.</v>

46
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

47
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:24.711
<v Speaker 1>you've got Germany and France and </v>
<v Speaker 1>England while let's say Germany and </v>

48
00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:25.320
<v Speaker 1>France powerhouses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially Germany,</v>

49
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>they can afford to bring Greece in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe,</v>

50
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.320
<v Speaker 1>but there's no evidence that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>afford it.</v>

51
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greece is unbelievably corrupt.</v>

52
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.360
<v Speaker 1>No one pays her income tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem,</v>

53
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And bringing them in to a union at a </v>

54
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.190
<v Speaker 1>high order has no effect whatsoever on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the micro behaviors.</v>

55
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.550
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is the micro behaviors </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be rectified and no one really </v>

56
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.821
<v Speaker 1>knows how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you stop a country where people </v>

57
00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:58.161
<v Speaker 1>don't pay their taxes from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you stop the people from not </v>

58
00:02:58.161 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>paying their taxes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we pay our taxes?</v>

59
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could just all of a sudden decide not</v>

60
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:07.771
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government wouldn't have the </v>

61
00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>resources to run around gathering them </v>
<v Speaker 1>all up for one reason or another.</v>

62
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:13.231
<v Speaker 1>It's become customary for people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>functional Western democracies to pay </v>

63
00:03:13.231 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>their taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why,</v>

64
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.540
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have been way easier for us </v>

65
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.540
<v Speaker 1>just to do what the Greeks did and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend to pay them,</v>

66
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there are too big I think.</v>

67
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 1>And so the people on the right is saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the nation and like I understand</v>

68
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:30.870
<v Speaker 1>why they're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

69
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.740
<v Speaker 1>but the danger is the nation will </v>
<v Speaker 1>subordinate the individual and I do see </v>

70
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>it as another example of safe spaces.</v>

71
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 1>It's just scales different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

72
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I think that the proper </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidote to that,</v>

73
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 1>to both the chaos on the left and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>order on the right roughly speaking,</v>

74
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 1>is to walk the proper line in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>

75
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we better do that because things are not</v>

76
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 1>things that are too chaotic at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

77
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 1>So it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's really good that's possible.</v>

78
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.610
<v Speaker 1>But we're in a state where I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe we're in a state where things </v>

79
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>could go any number of ways and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

80
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 1>there's no predicting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

81
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 1>And I've never felt that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived in the eighties and you know,</v>

83
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 1>political correctness rose up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties as well,</v>

84
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 1>and I can remember a lot of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in the early seventies with the</v>

85
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:28.201
<v Speaker 1>oil crisis and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there were times when things were </v>

86
00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:29.320
<v Speaker 1>shaky but they weren't shaking the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are now.</v>

87
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 1>They're an internal shakiness rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than something that was a threat that </v>

88
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to be imposed from the outside.</v>

89
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

90
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.380
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

91
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.270
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

92
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.630
<v Speaker 1>it is associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this intellectual war that's going </v>

93
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.960
<v Speaker 1>on with postmodernism in new Marxism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that as well.</v>

94
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.590
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
