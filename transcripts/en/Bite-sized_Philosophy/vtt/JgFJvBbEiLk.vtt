1
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Final rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's called pet a cat when you </v>

2
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:07.620
<v Speaker 1>encounter one on the street and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very.</v>

3
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>It's the most personal chapter in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

4
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot about my daughter and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter was very ill when she was,</v>

5
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.120
<v Speaker 1>when she was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but particularly when she was a </v>

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.120
<v Speaker 1>teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had a very terrible time of it.</v>

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.730
<v Speaker 1>She had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when she was between the ages of 14 </v>

8
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.171
<v Speaker 1>and 16 at first destroyed her hip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which had to be replaced and then it </v>

9
00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:33.441
<v Speaker 1>destroyed the ankle on her other leg </v>
<v Speaker 1>which had to be replaced and she walked </v>

10
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:38.781
<v Speaker 1>around for two years on broken legs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was taking massive doses of opiates </v>

11
00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:43.581
<v Speaker 1>and could hardly stay awake and like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she had this advanced auto immune </v>

12
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:47.631
<v Speaker 1>disease which produced all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>other symptoms that were just as bad as </v>

13
00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>the joint degeneration but which are </v>
<v Speaker 1>harder to describe.</v>

14
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>And so it was just bloody brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:56.721
<v Speaker 1>and as a test of your faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's almost nothing that's more </v>

16
00:00:56.721 --> 00:00:59.940
<v Speaker 1>direct than a serious illness inflicted </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon an innocent child.</v>

17
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the chapter is a meditation on </v>

18
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:04.970
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also on,</v>

19
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.880
<v Speaker 1>well what to do in a situation like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everyone is going to have a </v>

20
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.240
<v Speaker 1>situation like that in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.160
<v Speaker 1>because you'll be faced with illness in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that you love and in crisis.</v>

22
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:19.161
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a practical guide to coping with </v>

23
00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:22.551
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in one of the things you do when </v>

24
00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>you're overwhelmed by crisis is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>shortened your timeframe.</v>

25
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can't think about next </v>

26
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.490
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can't even bloody well think </v>

27
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.490
<v Speaker 1>about next week or maybe not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>

28
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because now is just so overwhelming that</v>

29
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:34.610
<v Speaker 1>that's all there is.</v>

30
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what you do.</v>

31
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>You cut your timeframe back until you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can cope with it.</v>

32
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:42.210
<v Speaker 1>And if it's not the next week that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see how to get through,</v>

33
00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 1>then it's the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's not the next day,</v>

34
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>then it's the next hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's not the next hour,</v>

35
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>then it's the next minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

36
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>people are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

37
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.060
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tough.</v>

38
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that if you face </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

39
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.310
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that if you face things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can put up with a lot more than</v>

40
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:07.311
<v Speaker 1>you think you can put up within,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do it without becoming </v>

41
00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>corrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she did recover quite,</v>

42
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>quite fully and much as a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our own machinations because she figured</v>

43
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 1>out what was wrong with her and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>took the necessary steps to fix it,</v>

44
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>which is nothing short of a bloody </v>
<v Speaker 1>miracle as far as I'm concerned.</v>

45
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.450
<v Speaker 1>And anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the,</v>

46
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.790
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cat bit is I actually started by </v>

47
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>talking about our daughter who actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>died at about a year ago,</v>

48
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>but he's still alive in the book.</v>

49
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

50
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I let people know because dog lovers </v>

51
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.381
<v Speaker 1>love dogs and if you love cats than they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think you don't like dogs and then they </v>

52
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:42.830
<v Speaker 1>don't like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I also pointed out at the beginning </v>

53
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.830
<v Speaker 1>of the chapter that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.130
<v Speaker 1>if you want a pet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dog on the street,</v>

55
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:49.131
<v Speaker 1>that's okay too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't have to get up in arms </v>

56
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:49.131
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

57
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:49.131
<v Speaker 1>But the idea is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>you have to be alert when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

59
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:54.270
<v Speaker 1>you have to be alert to the beauty in </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

60
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.570
<v Speaker 1>the unexpected beauty in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of what I was trying to </v>

61
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.781
<v Speaker 1>get across with the idea of the cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this cat that lives across the </v>

62
00:03:02.781 --> 00:03:02.880
<v Speaker 1>street from us called Ginger Ginger's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assamese.</v>

63
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Captain Cat's really aren't domesticated</v>
<v Speaker 1>a technically speaking.</v>

64
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>They're still wild animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they kind of like people.</v>

65
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>God only knows why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do,</v>

66
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.460
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

67
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>And so ginger will come wandering over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and our dog looks at her,</v>

68
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:18.330
<v Speaker 1>but their friends and she rolls over on </v>
<v Speaker 1>his back and seek.</v>

69
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.340
<v Speaker 1>We used to noser a bit and then she'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of Mosey over and let you pet her </v>

70
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>if she was feeling like that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

71
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>you have to look for those little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

72
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>little bit of sparkling crystal in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>darkness.</v>

73
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:36.901
<v Speaker 1>When things are bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to look and see where things </v>

74
00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:38.630
<v Speaker 1>are still beautiful and where there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>still something that's sustaining.</v>

75
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you narrow your timeframe and you be </v>

76
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.561
<v Speaker 1>grateful for what you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can get you through some very </v>

77
00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>dark times and maybe even successfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're lucky,</v>

78
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:54.121
<v Speaker 1>but even if unsuccessfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe it's only tragic and not </v>

79
00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 1>absolute hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can do that,</v>

80
00:03:56.411 --> 00:04:01.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the worst situation you can make it </v>

81
00:04:01.411 --> 00:04:01.411
<v Speaker 1>only tragic and not held.</v>

82
00:04:01.411 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 1>And there's a big gap between tragedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and hell,</v>

83
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing worse at a deathbed than</v>

84
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 1>to see the people they're fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The death is bad enough,</v>

85
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.080
<v Speaker 1>but you can take that as terrible as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is and making into something that's </v>

86
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 1>absolutely unbearable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe I think,</v>

87
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:19.290
<v Speaker 1>and this is sort of what I closed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book with,</v>

88
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.080
<v Speaker 1>is this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if we didn't all attempt to make</v>

89
00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>terrible things even worse than they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

90
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.690
<v Speaker 1>then maybe we could tolerate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible things that we have to put up </v>

91
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 1>with in order to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe we could make the world into a</v>

92
00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 1>better place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

93
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:38.281
<v Speaker 1>And it's what we should be doing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we could be doing because we don't </v>

94
00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 1>have anything better to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what the book is about.</v>

95
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's the end of 12 rules for life.</v>

96
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.150
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
