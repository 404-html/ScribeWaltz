1
00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.920
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I learned while I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going through this was the meaning </v>

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.461
<v Speaker 1>of the name Israel because Jacob </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually it gets named Israel and I'm </v>

3
00:00:09.461 --> 00:00:11.570
<v Speaker 1>jumping ahead a little bit tender to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next lecture,</v>

4
00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:16.571
<v Speaker 1>but Israel and so he's also the father </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Israel and the father of the 12 sons </v>

5
00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:22.031
<v Speaker 1>who make up the 12 tribes of Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what Israel means is he who </v>

6
00:00:22.031 --> 00:00:25.601
<v Speaker 1>struggles with God and that's such an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting idea because it's again,</v>

7
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:30.611
<v Speaker 1>a psychological idea and that's why I </v>
<v Speaker 1>said earlier that it isn't obvious in </v>

8
00:00:30.611 --> 00:00:35.021
<v Speaker 1>the old testament what it means to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in God because what Jacob does </v>

9
00:00:35.021 --> 00:00:37.820
<v Speaker 1>struggle with God and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good characterization of</v>

10
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.690
<v Speaker 1>an ethical life because if you're trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lead an ethical life,</v>

11
00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:44.210
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're doing is you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're struggling.</v>

12
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Like blind belief isn't helpful because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what you're believing in.</v>

13
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.910
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not that helpful,</v>

14
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.420
<v Speaker 1>but if you're possessed by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the desire to orient yourself </v>

15
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.630
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also confused by the,</v>

16
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.880
<v Speaker 1>by the existential structure of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

17
00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:03.881
<v Speaker 1>which we all are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then then what you're doing when you're </v>

18
00:01:03.881 --> 00:01:06.701
<v Speaker 1>trying to orient yourself properly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>life is struggling ethically and in </v>

19
00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Jacob actually gets quite hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wrestles with God,</v>

20
00:01:09.051 --> 00:01:12.020
<v Speaker 1>literally God dislocates his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

21
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.290
<v Speaker 1>his thigh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea there is watch the hell </v>

22
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.290
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

23
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.760
<v Speaker 1>The thing that you're contending with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his powerful,</v>

24
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.790
<v Speaker 1>although you can contend with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that's so interesting,</v>

25
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.310
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do it at some genuine peril,</v>

26
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>which I think is exactly right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that Israel,</v>

27
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.770
<v Speaker 1>so there's Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state,</v>

28
00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:32.870
<v Speaker 1>let's say in Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the promised land and all of that,</v>

29
00:01:32.871 --> 00:01:35.030
<v Speaker 1>but there's this more important idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>which is again,</v>

30
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.060
<v Speaker 1>a psychological idea which is the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Israel,</v>

31
00:01:38.061 --> 00:01:43.061
<v Speaker 1>which is the promised land is the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>that everyone who wrestles with God </v>

32
00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:48.010
<v Speaker 1>exists in and that's not happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>naive belief in,</v>

33
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.450
<v Speaker 1>an eternally blessed afterlife.</v>

35
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not that it's not a wish </v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfillment,</v>

36
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

37
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.430
<v Speaker 1>it's to be actively engaged in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the difficulties of life.</v>

38
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And trying to find the path because </v>

39
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.030
<v Speaker 1>that's what wrestling with God is trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find the path.</v>

40
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.210
<v Speaker 1>And that seems to me what belief means </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally in the Old Testament and </v>

41
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.951
<v Speaker 1>perhaps in the new testament as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>that belief is expressed in trying to </v>

42
00:02:17.951 --> 00:02:22.781
<v Speaker 1>find the path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an ethical struggle and it's </v>

43
00:02:22.781 --> 00:02:23.060
<v Speaker 1>a real struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the struggle of life.</v>

44
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:25.880
<v Speaker 1>So as long as you're willing to engage </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that struggle,</v>

45
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.750
<v Speaker 1>then hypothetically you have the divine </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind you.</v>

46
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.620
<v Speaker 1>And so I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true because the other </v>

47
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:41.771
<v Speaker 1>thing I see is that the people who set </v>
<v Speaker 1>things right so that the,</v>

48
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.980
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the horrible forces of cosmic </v>

49
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.221
<v Speaker 1>destruction don't do us in the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are trying to set things right are </v>

50
00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:55.271
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are struggling ethically </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so and that there is a redemptive </v>

51
00:02:55.271 --> 00:02:59.891
<v Speaker 1>element to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think there's any way of </v>

52
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:00.320
<v Speaker 1>being cynical about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

53
00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so thank you.</v>

54
00:03:03.021 --> 00:03:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Will.</v>

55
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.920
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
