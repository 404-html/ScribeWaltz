1
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a psychologist named piaget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you might know about him.</v>

2
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Piaget was very interested in what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to value structures and their </v>

3
00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:21.571
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical organization once they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to apply outside of the confines of a </v>

4
00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:23.230
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.650
<v Speaker 1>so here's a way of thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two year olds basically hypothalamic.</v>

6
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.050
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First they're happy,</v>

7
00:00:29.051 --> 00:00:30.310
<v Speaker 1>then they're sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're hungry,</v>

8
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>then they're tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.370
<v Speaker 1>they just zipped from one pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward and rather are inspiring</v>

10
00:00:36.371 --> 00:00:40.360
<v Speaker 1>motivational state to another and but at</v>
<v Speaker 1>two they can't play.</v>

11
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.740
<v Speaker 1>They can play with by themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't play with other children.</v>

12
00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:49.741
<v Speaker 1>They can't get that until they're three </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they need to get it by the time </v>

13
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:50.440
<v Speaker 1>they're three because if they don't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>it by the time,</v>

14
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.510
<v Speaker 1>therefore they will never get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have an antisocial kid </v>

15
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.730
<v Speaker 1>who's going to be an outsider for his </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire life and there isn't anything you</v>

16
00:00:57.731 --> 00:00:58.450
<v Speaker 1>can do about it.</v>

17
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.790
<v Speaker 1>So that has to happen between two and </v>
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

18
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker 1>So what happens at about age three is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the kid learns how to play a game </v>

19
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.230
<v Speaker 1>with another person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that game is,</v>

20
00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:11.231
<v Speaker 1>is fundamentally the development of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to share a frame of reference,</v>

21
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.450
<v Speaker 1>which is what you're doing when you play</v>
<v Speaker 1>monopoly.</v>

22
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's stupid to play monopoly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

23
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.810
<v Speaker 1>who cares if you have a whole pile of </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterfeit paper,</v>

24
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But doesn't matter because the way your </v>

25
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.051
<v Speaker 1>constituted is that your brain will </v>
<v Speaker 1>treat anything you acting like </v>

26
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.770
<v Speaker 1>constitutes a valuable goal as if it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>valid framework of reference.</v>

27
00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:34.060
<v Speaker 1>And if it couldn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

28
00:01:34.061 --> 00:01:39.061
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't abstract and B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could not get along with other </v>

29
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:42.511
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can sit around the table and you </v>

30
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:44.791
<v Speaker 1>can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's pretend that monopoly is a </v>

31
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:47.080
<v Speaker 1>reasonable facsimile of reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you wouldn't say,</v>

32
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's what you mean.</v>

33
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.780
<v Speaker 1>And everybody says yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a music.</v>

34
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>And so then you set your goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to get all the little hotels </v>

35
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.940
<v Speaker 1>and all the money and Poof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your emotions go along for the ride.</v>

36
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.600
<v Speaker 1>And what's so interesting about that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get everybody into the game.</v>

37
00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:09.601
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about people is that we can </v>

38
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:12.631
<v Speaker 1>establish a shared fictional frame of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference and it organizes all our </v>

39
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:13.360
<v Speaker 1>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're predictable.</v>

40
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.930
<v Speaker 1>That's also why we can watch movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go to a movie,</v>

41
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.570
<v Speaker 1>you identify the hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you figure out what the hero wants,</v>

42
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.340
<v Speaker 1>proof you're the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way that works is you don't look</v>

43
00:02:24.341 --> 00:02:28.330
<v Speaker 1>at the hero and think about what he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and evaluated emotionally and then</v>

44
00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:33.331
<v Speaker 1>feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you do is you specify the hero's </v>

45
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:36.211
<v Speaker 1>goal and then you map them onto your </v>
<v Speaker 1>body and you read off the emotional </v>

46
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:38.680
<v Speaker 1>responses of your own body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how you understand the hero.</v>

47
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's an embodied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

48
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.120
<v Speaker 1>you're using your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your embodiment as a computational </v>

49
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.270
<v Speaker 1>device that can run simulations of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousnesses.</v>

50
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.090
<v Speaker 1>And it does that with the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we like doing that.</v>

51
00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:56.530
<v Speaker 1>You can go to a movie and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're Brad Pitt for an hour and a half.</v>

52
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're Brad Pitt doing remarkable </v>

53
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.861
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's also how we understand other </v>

54
00:03:04.861 --> 00:03:04.861
<v Speaker 1>people were very good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

55
00:03:04.861 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>we have these shared frames of reference</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when we're playing monopoly,</v>

56
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so children at three learn how to play </v>

57
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>games and that means they learn how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize their own internal motivational</v>

58
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:19.501
<v Speaker 1>states into a hierarchy that includes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the motivational states of other people </v>

59
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.810
<v Speaker 1>and that means they can play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you guys do when you're </v>

60
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.270
<v Speaker 1>out in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're playing a game right now.</v>

61
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.420
<v Speaker 1>We all know the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we can all sit in this room </v>

62
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>and play the game without fighting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

63
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the room is set up like a theater and</v>

64
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:38.311
<v Speaker 1>we all know the theater game and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the chairs are all facing this way </v>

65
00:03:38.311 --> 00:03:42.841
<v Speaker 1>at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a hint that you should </v>

66
00:03:42.841 --> 00:03:44.611
<v Speaker 1>look forward and this is raised so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know the room is basically telling you </v>

67
00:03:44.611 --> 00:03:48.601
<v Speaker 1>what to do because it's a stage like all</v>
<v Speaker 1>rooms and because you're smart and </v>

68
00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:53.131
<v Speaker 1>socially conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can walk into a stage room and your </v>

69
00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 1>body knows what to do and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilized and social you just do it.</v>

70
00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Then all the other primates can predict </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're up to and they won't kill </v>

71
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.390
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

72
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's what it means to be part of </v>

73
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.071
<v Speaker 1>the same tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when people are very peculiar </v>

74
00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 1>creatures and God only knows what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're up to,</v>

75
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 1>but as long as they're playing the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>game you are.</v>

76
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:15.781
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to know what they're up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to because you can predict what they're </v>

77
00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:18.541
<v Speaker 1>going to do and you understand their </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivational states and so part of the </v>

78
00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 1>building and constructing of higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>order motive,</v>

79
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.860
<v Speaker 1>higher order moral goals is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment of joint frames of </v>

80
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 1>reference that allow multiple people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue the goals that they're interested</v>

81
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.110
<v Speaker 1>in simultaneously and then what you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think about with regards to that is </v>

82
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.030
<v Speaker 1>that not all shared frames of reference </v>
<v Speaker 1>can manage that.</v>

83
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.300
<v Speaker 1>There's a small subset of them that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimized so that not only can multiple </v>

84
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.041
<v Speaker 1>people play them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but multiple people can play them and </v>

85
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 1>enjoy them and do it repeatedly across a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long period of time.</v>

86
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.840
<v Speaker 1>So it's integratability that partly </v>
<v Speaker 1>defines the utility of a higher order </v>

87
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.220
<v Speaker 1>moral structure and that is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary.</v>

88
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 1>It's an emergent property of biological </v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions and you might say,</v>

89
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:09.421
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of arbitrary because people </v>

90
00:05:09.421 --> 00:05:11.461
<v Speaker 1>can do what they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not arbitrary at all because a </v>

91
00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:14.020
<v Speaker 1>lot of what's constraining your games is</v>
<v Speaker 1>your motivational substructure and those</v>

92
00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:19.021
<v Speaker 1>ancient circuits that are status </v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented and they operate within </v>

93
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.360
<v Speaker 1>virtually every animal has a status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Counter creatures organize themselves </v>

94
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.251
<v Speaker 1>into dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason they do that is because that </v>

95
00:05:29.251 --> 00:05:29.680
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a solution.</v>

96
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:32.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a solution to the Darwinian problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>of existence.</v>

97
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the nap and phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the real thing.</v>

98
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your environment,</v>

99
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:44.251
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally a huge chunk of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment is dominance hierarchy plus </v>

100
00:05:44.251 --> 00:05:48.300
<v Speaker 1>God only knows where you are and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the order in chaos and part of the </v>

101
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.501
<v Speaker 1>reason that people fight to preserve </v>
<v Speaker 1>their dominance hierarchies is because </v>

102
00:05:52.501 --> 00:05:52.501
<v Speaker 1>it's better to be a slave.</v>

103
00:05:52.501 --> 00:05:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what the hell is going on than</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who's thrown screaming and naked</v>

104
00:05:56.441 --> 00:06:01.441
<v Speaker 1>into the jungle night and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between order and chaos and </v>

105
00:06:01.441 --> 00:06:06.190
<v Speaker 1>we like order better than chaos and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no wonder now we'll invite a little </v>

106
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>chaos in for entertainment now and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be done voluntarily.</v>

107
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 1>And generally you don't want the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos that upsets your entire conceptual</v>

108
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:14.640
<v Speaker 1>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

109
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 1>you're willing to fool around on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fringes a little bit,</v>

110
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 1>but you know when the going gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious,</v>

111
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty much likely to bail out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and no wonder.</v>
