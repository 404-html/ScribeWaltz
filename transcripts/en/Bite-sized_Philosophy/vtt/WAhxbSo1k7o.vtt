00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.990
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting about people who have Russo,</v>

2
00:00:02.991 --> 00:00:07.991
<v Speaker 1>he and ideas about children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so children are all good and they get </v>

3
00:00:07.991 --> 00:00:11.211
<v Speaker 1>corrupted by society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is half true because they're also </v>

4
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:15.120
<v Speaker 1>not good and they get shaped and </v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline by society.</v>

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>But there were so many types after our </v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>

6
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:23.721
<v Speaker 1>When their kids hit teenage years or </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're judging like say criminal </v>

7
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:29.661
<v Speaker 1>teenagers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the child is perfect until </v>

8
00:00:29.661 --> 00:00:32.481
<v Speaker 1>they hit like 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they turned into a teenager and </v>

9
00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:34.791
<v Speaker 1>then they're like thugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they go from good to thug in one </v>

10
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:34.791
<v Speaker 1>move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

11
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:39.231
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you often see that in families too </v>

12
00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>that have treated especially their </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughters like a princess,</v>

13
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.080
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they hit puberty and the </v>

14
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>parents who have princess them to death </v>
<v Speaker 1>have no idea what to do with them.</v>

15
00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:48.420
<v Speaker 1>And so then they become demonized.</v>

16
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.420
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overly good child turns into the </v>

17
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.830
<v Speaker 1>overly wicked teenager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes they'll act that out to.</v>

18
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.340
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I've seen with girls </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are held in princess esteem when </v>

19
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:05.100
<v Speaker 1>they're little and their parents have </v>
<v Speaker 1>too tight a grip on them.</v>

20
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.110
<v Speaker 1>And too much of a demand for good </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors,</v>

21
00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>they'll find some nasty character to </v>
<v Speaker 1>associate with who will tear them out of</v>

22
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:15.921
<v Speaker 1>the family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No bikers are really good for that sort </v>

23
00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:15.921
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not.</v>

24
00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>And especially if you have some vengeful</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts towards your parents.</v>

25
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Biker is your perfect solution to that </v>

26
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.840
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
