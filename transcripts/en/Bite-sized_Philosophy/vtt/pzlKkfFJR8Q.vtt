00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fine arts programs now in in I think</v>

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.540
<v Speaker 1>pretty much almost 100 percent are based</v>
<v Speaker 1>on contemporary art practices and so </v>

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>very few universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few programs teach technical skills</v>

4
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:18.111
<v Speaker 1>or teach you how to draw in a in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>classical way so they actually not </v>

5
00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:22.370
<v Speaker 1>really teaching anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to know exactly what they're </v>

6
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.370
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.080
<v Speaker 2>I guess it was ever since the 19 sixties</v>
<v Speaker 2>through speeding this idea in the art </v>

8
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.191
<v Speaker 2>world that technical skills and ability </v>
<v Speaker 2>just aren't that important and that the </v>

9
00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:32.960
<v Speaker 2>important thing is to find your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say your political voice,</v>

10
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:37.910
<v Speaker 2>but it's very strange to me that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>has occurred because it seems to me that</v>

11
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.020
<v Speaker 2>before your voice is anything but a an </v>
<v Speaker 2>off color croak,</v>

12
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.800
<v Speaker 2>you have to become a disciple of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline and an apprenticeship and and</v>

13
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.100
<v Speaker 2>learn the tools and trades of your craft</v>
<v Speaker 2>and learn how to be an artist because </v>

14
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.920
<v Speaker 2>there's a technical end to that.</v>

15
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really almost an image of the </v>

16
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.580
<v Speaker 1>world as it stands now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

17
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purpose or the stated purpose of,</v>

18
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.950
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of modern officially postmodern art was </v>

19
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.950
<v Speaker 1>to free the artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to break,</v>

20
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.500
<v Speaker 1>to break away all the things that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding the artist back in terms of </v>

21
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.130
<v Speaker 1>rules and in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

22
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.290
<v Speaker 1>just the way things were presented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when ended up happening is that </v>

23
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.200
<v Speaker 1>there were no more legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimizing objective or you know,</v>

24
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.300
<v Speaker 1>strong legitimising structures around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the art.</v>

25
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.100
<v Speaker 1>The only thing left was politics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships and status basically.</v>

26
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:28.840
<v Speaker 1>So our funders,</v>

27
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a big literature on creativity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's strongly,</v>

28
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 2>which I know very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My lab designed the creative achievement</v>

29
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:40.851
<v Speaker 2>questionnaire which is used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been used in hundreds of studies </v>

30
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:43.791
<v Speaker 2>now to assess lifetime creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I've spent a lot of time looking </v>

31
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 2>at the measurement of creativity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>also trying to understand creativity.</v>

32
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:51.291
<v Speaker 2>And the literature strongly suggest that</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you impose restrictions on people,</v>

33
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 2>it actually makes them more creative </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than less.</v>

34
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 2>Because part of what creativity is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>overcoming of obstacles.</v>

35
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine someone who writes poetry and </v>

36
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.520
<v Speaker 2>the Haiku format.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

37
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.320
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

38
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 2>very restrictive and obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>arbitrarily sold.</v>

39
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.560
<v Speaker 2>But the fact of the restriction is </v>
<v Speaker 2>partly what makes the poetic form </v>

40
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same thing is true.</v>

41
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:15.620
<v Speaker 2>If you think about playing a game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a.</v>

42
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.780
<v Speaker 2>there's far more things that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>do when you play chess than there are </v>

43
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.161
<v Speaker 2>things that you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's still an infinite number of </v>

44
00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:28.581
<v Speaker 2>variations of chess games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this idea that there's a dichotomy </v>

45
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:30.930
<v Speaker 2>between structure and rules and </v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity is,</v>

46
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 2>is pernicious Lee false and contradicted</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the evidence.</v>

47
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.120
<v Speaker 1>And when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you started to explore the art </v>

48
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.120
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way it works is there's an irony</v>

49
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.381
<v Speaker 1>there that it purports to not have </v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries on creativity and </v>

50
00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:48.271
<v Speaker 1>instructions on care team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're actually extremely strict </v>

51
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:48.271
<v Speaker 1>and they're hidden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

52
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:51.920
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of this pernicious thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>underneath where we're actually you.</v>

53
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.480
<v Speaker 1>You have to present things in a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very precise way for it to be able to,</v>

54
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.570
<v Speaker 1>to enter into the legitimizing structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

55
00:02:59.571 --> 00:03:00.290
<v Speaker 1>of the gallery.</v>
