1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:00.900
<v Speaker 1>I read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote,</v>

2
00:00:00.901 --> 00:00:04.620
<v Speaker 1>read a very interesting book awhile back</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the wealth and poverty of nations</v>

3
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:09.621
<v Speaker 1>that was written by a Harvard emeritus </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor of history and one of the </v>

4
00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:10.890
<v Speaker 1>things that he claimed I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was very smart,</v>

5
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:14.100
<v Speaker 1>was that the only true natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>

6
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can set up a society where people</v>

7
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:19.920
<v Speaker 1>trust each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it will instantly become rich.</v>

8
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.190
<v Speaker 1>And he used the example of Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very conscientious society </v>

9
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.420
<v Speaker 1>and very rich society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Japanese have no natural </v>

10
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.420
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

11
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.500
<v Speaker 1>None to speak of and yet the rich and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have countries like the Soviet </v>

12
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Russia and much of South America where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just natural resources,</v>

13
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:38.580
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just like Venezuela.</v>

14
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.890
<v Speaker 1>Just more natural resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you know what to do with and the </v>

15
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 1>places are absolute catastrophes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My absolute catastrophes of cynicism and</v>

16
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:47.970
<v Speaker 1>corruption.</v>

17
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 1>And so he attempted to document the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between default </v>

18
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.970
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal trust among citizens </v>
<v Speaker 1>within countries and their,</v>

19
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.070
<v Speaker 1>their productivity in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their GDP and their standard of living </v>

20
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 1>and found a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tight relationship.</v>

21
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:08.181
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I liked that a lot and I've got a </v>

22
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:08.340
<v Speaker 1>story about that quickly that I think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting.</v>

23
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you two stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One sort of generic,</v>

24
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you one personal first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one day I lend my car to one of my </v>

25
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.290
<v Speaker 1>graduate students and he took it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Montreal,</v>

26
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.350
<v Speaker 1>is this old Cadillac and he got it was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad rainstorm in Montreal and he </v>

27
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:30.021
<v Speaker 1>was in one of the highways that are like</v>
<v Speaker 1>set into the ground and it was like six </v>

28
00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>inches of water and he was turning a </v>
<v Speaker 1>corner,</v>

29
00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:36.861
<v Speaker 1>hit the brakes and skidded on the water </v>
<v Speaker 1>and smacked it into the wall and on the </v>

30
00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>corner of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the bumper,</v>

31
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

32
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>And so then he brought it back and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was very apologetic about it.</v>

33
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:41.590
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

34
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.880
<v Speaker 1>his name was matt shade tell you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Matt might hear this and I can </v>

35
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.210
<v Speaker 1>shame them and bit for doing this 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

36
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

37
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.500
<v Speaker 1>he's a professor at the Ontario </v>
<v Speaker 1>Institute of Technology I think now and </v>

38
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>quite a successful one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

39
00:01:56.281 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>he brought the car back and I went and </v>
<v Speaker 1>got it evaluated for damages,</v>

40
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:03.730
<v Speaker 1>it was like $1,700</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something to repair it and,</v>

41
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.110
<v Speaker 1>or maybe more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was almost as much as the car was</v>

42
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 1>worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

43
00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:13.311
<v Speaker 1>well I'm not gonna do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went online and I typed in the part</v>

44
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do that you can get people to bid</v>

45
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>on sending you used part from all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>North America.</v>

46
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:24.531
<v Speaker 1>So that's Kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's all these junk dealers have </v>

47
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>got together and they have this network </v>
<v Speaker 1>of communication.</v>

48
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 1>So you put in the car part and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>send you a bit.</v>

49
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>And so this guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

50
00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:31.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll send you that bumper assembly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the whole bumper and the lights</v>

51
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 1>for like 250 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

52
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

53
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>you could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be good.</v>

54
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.140
<v Speaker 1>So then I said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he called me up about half an </v>

55
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.640
<v Speaker 1>hour later if this guy from way down </v>
<v Speaker 1>south,</v>

56
00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 1>he had a really deep sort of Mississippi</v>
<v Speaker 1>accent and he said,</v>

57
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.620
<v Speaker 1>wait a sec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that for the bumper or the bumper </v>

58
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.620
<v Speaker 1>assembly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

59
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was for the bumper assembly.</v>

60
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

61
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was for the bumper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he said,</v>

62
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:56.400
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll send it to you anyways.</v>

63
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.530
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's pretty good.</v>

64
00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 1>So said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well thank you.</v>

65
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>And then I hung up and then half an hour</v>
<v Speaker 1>later he called me up again and he said,</v>

66
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:08.491
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just went out and looked at that </v>

67
00:03:08.491 --> 00:03:09.841
<v Speaker 1>bumper assembly and there's a plastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>trim piece on the side and it has a </v>

68
00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:09.841
<v Speaker 1>scratch in it.</v>

69
00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:14.310
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I better tell you that just in case you </v>

70
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.310
<v Speaker 1>didn't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

71
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so amazing.</v>

72
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's a miracle man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this guy,</v>

73
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>he's somewhere in Mississippi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm never going to see him again.</v>

74
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never gonna have any contact with them.</v>

75
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Like he made a bad deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

76
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Because the part was worth more than he </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to sell it to me for,</v>

77
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>but he stuck with this deal and then he </v>
<v Speaker 1>went over and above the call of duty.</v>

78
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

79
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>this part that I'm selling you to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>for way less than it's worth is damaged.</v>

80
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>So I thought I'd better tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

81
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.980
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to recognize a miracle when you </v>

82
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.980
<v Speaker 1>see one that was a miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

83
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's thanks for calling man.</v>

84
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.290
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can handle the scratch.</v>

85
00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Send the part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did and I got the car fixed and </v>

86
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>forgave Matt and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had a happy ending.</v>

87
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's trust,</v>

88
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I didn't know him from Adam and </v>

89
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 1>he's a primate full of snakes just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of us.</v>

90
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.980
<v Speaker 1>And yet he was willing to simplify </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself to the point where I could just </v>

91
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.041
<v Speaker 1>take him absolutely at his word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that meant we could trade even </v>

92
00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:11.041
<v Speaker 1>though we were strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

93
00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:15.900
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not underestimate the utility of </v>

94
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.900
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's Ebay.</v>

95
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.860
<v Speaker 1>When Ebay first started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the idea was not gonna work </v>

96
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.640
<v Speaker 1>because you'll send me junk and all send</v>
<v Speaker 1>you a check that bounces and that'll be </v>

97
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.640
<v Speaker 1>the end of Ebay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

98
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.650
<v Speaker 1>and so these escrow agents popped up so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could insure your transaction with </v>

99
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.460
<v Speaker 1>them moves for like 10 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transaction.</v>

100
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.850
<v Speaker 1>They would get the check and the goods </v>
<v Speaker 1>and make sure that they were okay and </v>

101
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 1>then send them on or ensure the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transaction,</v>

102
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 1>but what happened was the escrow agents </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't make any money and the reason for</v>

103
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:45.370
<v Speaker 1>that was no one cheated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think about how amazing that is,</v>

104
00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:47.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You bring these people together across a</v>

105
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 1>whole continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've never seen each other before.</v>

106
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Speaker 1>They're never going to interact with </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other again,</v>

107
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:54.760
<v Speaker 1>and this was before there were any </v>
<v Speaker 1>reputation ratings on Ebay,</v>

108
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>and yet the default transaction was you </v>
<v Speaker 1>describe your goods honestly,</v>

109
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 1>including their flaws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You set a reasonable price.</v>

110
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>I decided to pay you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ship the goods and I pay you,</v>

111
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.130
<v Speaker 1>and it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happened was that Ebay </v>

112
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.071
<v Speaker 1>produced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it produced a tremendous amount of </v>

113
00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:15.240
<v Speaker 1>capital that was previously frozen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so frozen capitalist.</v>

114
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.250
<v Speaker 1>When you've invested money in something </v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is no longer useful to </v>

115
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.361
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the money is just sitting there </v>

116
00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:24.361
<v Speaker 1>frozen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

117
00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't get it loose because,</v>

118
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got an attic full of junk.</v>

119
00:05:27.821 --> 00:05:29.620
<v Speaker 1>How are you gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get rid of that.</v>

120
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>E bay.</v>

121
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.520
<v Speaker 1>And so all of a sudden all these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were just junk became valuable and </v>

122
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.030
<v Speaker 1>everybody got richer and none of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't.</v>

123
00:05:36.031 --> 00:05:41.031
<v Speaker 1>It would have happened without the </v>
<v Speaker 1>covenant that we established between </v>

124
00:05:41.031 --> 00:05:44.071
<v Speaker 1>each other that's predicated on trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say that trust is the </v>

125
00:05:44.071 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 1>currency and currency is trust because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a promissory note,</v>

126
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:48.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if people lie,</v>

127
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:50.950
<v Speaker 1>then the currency gets debased very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly.</v>

128
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.080
<v Speaker 1>And so the economy runs on trust.</v>
