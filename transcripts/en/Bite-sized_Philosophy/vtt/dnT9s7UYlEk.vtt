1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.400
<v Speaker 1>And behold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word of the Lord came unto him </v>

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.580
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shall not be there in heir,</v>

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.060
<v Speaker 1>but he that shall come forth out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottle,</v>

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>should be nine here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he gets promised the impossible once </v>

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.791
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he brought him forth abroad and </v>

6
00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:17.791
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now look towards the heaven and tell the</v>

7
00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:19.090
<v Speaker 1>stars if that will be able to number </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

8
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.180
<v Speaker 1>And he said unto him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so shall thy seed be,</v>

9
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.450
<v Speaker 1>and he believed in the Lord and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>counted to him for righteousness.</v>

10
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Seeing that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

11
00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:33.070
<v Speaker 1>this is the covenant idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this belief,</v>

12
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.340
<v Speaker 1>because here's the belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the willingness to act as if the </v>

13
00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>world is constructed so that if you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right thing,</v>

14
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.970
<v Speaker 1>the best possible outcome will occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a decision.</v>

15
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>That's the covenant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

16
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:56.841
<v Speaker 1>So decision about how to live in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world because the evidence can't be </v>

17
00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:58.140
<v Speaker 1>there before you make the decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

18
00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.880
<v Speaker 1>And so you might hedge your bets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when,</v>

19
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.300
<v Speaker 1>when Christ comes back in the book of </v>
<v Speaker 1>revelation to judge people because he </v>

20
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.601
<v Speaker 1>comes back as a judge and virtually </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone gets cast out with the chaff </v>

21
00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:13.510
<v Speaker 1>and not saved with the wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he says something very interesting.</v>

22
00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:15.700
<v Speaker 1>He appears in division with a sword </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out of his mouth.</v>

23
00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:19.110
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrifying vision and he divides </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

24
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.710
<v Speaker 1>the he divides humanity into the damned </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the save or the day.</v>

25
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the damned and the saved.</v>

26
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.390
<v Speaker 1>He says something very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says</v>

27
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>to those who were neither hot nor cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will spew you out of my mouth.</v>

28
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.830
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

29
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.770
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

30
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>it's a disgust metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

31
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.980
<v Speaker 1>And what it says is that the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment isn't waiting for those who </v>

32
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:51.210
<v Speaker 1>committed to something and did wrong.</v>

33
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.010
<v Speaker 1>The worst punishment is reserved for </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who committed to nothing and </v>

34
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 1>stayed on the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really something to.</v>

35
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.630
<v Speaker 1>That's really something to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also something that I believe </v>

36
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.151
<v Speaker 1>to be true because I see that stacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is utterly destructive because </v>

37
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>there's no progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the resist movement backwards.</v>

38
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:15.630
<v Speaker 1>There's aging and suffering and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

39
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>And so to not commit to anything is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst of all.</v>

40
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:23.751
<v Speaker 1>Transgressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To commit means to put your body and </v>

41
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:27.951
<v Speaker 1>soul into something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To offer your life as a sacrifice means </v>

42
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:30.711
<v Speaker 1>that you're willing to make a bargain </v>
<v Speaker 1>with fate and the bargain is I'm going </v>

43
00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:34.431
<v Speaker 1>to act as if if I give it my all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the best possible thing will happen</v>

44
00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:39.741
<v Speaker 1>because of that and to not see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>analogy between that and the the active </v>

45
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:46.071
<v Speaker 1>faith in God is to misunderstand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story completely and it has to be an </v>

46
00:02:46.071 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>active faith because how are you going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to know?</v>

47
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.600
<v Speaker 1>You can look at other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't going to do it.</v>

48
00:02:51.601 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>It's at Kierkegaard was very clear about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of thing.</v>

49
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:59.211
<v Speaker 1>There's certain sorts of truth that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can only learn for yourself through </v>

50
00:02:59.211 --> 00:03:02.481
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's of course why Abraham also </v>

51
00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:02.481
<v Speaker 1>has to go out alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>He has to leave this candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an individual.</v>

53
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 1>It's the individuation process like </v>
<v Speaker 1>dying.</v>

54
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:11.971
<v Speaker 1>It's something that you do alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you can tell what is </v>

55
00:03:11.971 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 1>within your grasp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

56
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.490
<v Speaker 1>unless you make the ultimate sacrifice </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no way of finding out </v>

57
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 1>without actually making it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the sacrificial act,</v>

58
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

59
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 1>that's really emphasized in the act of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Abraham being called upon to sacrifice.</v>

60
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Isaac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about that is Abraham,</v>

61
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:33.781
<v Speaker 1>he's been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been like breaking himself into </v>

62
00:03:33.781 --> 00:03:36.721
<v Speaker 1>pieces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to progress forward through </v>

63
00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:39.421
<v Speaker 1>starvation and tyranny and war and </v>
<v Speaker 1>deceit and the potential loss of his </v>

64
00:03:39.421 --> 00:03:43.321
<v Speaker 1>wife and childlessness and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that can really be fall you </v>

65
00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:43.321
<v Speaker 1>in some sense.</v>

66
00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 1>And finally God grants him Isaac when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's old,</v>

67
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>it's impossibly gets Isaac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his son,</v>

68
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 1>and then what does God do next is say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

69
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that son that you've been waiting for.</v>

70
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 1>So for so long it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see just exactly what you're</v>

71
00:03:55.901 --> 00:04:00.901
<v Speaker 1>made of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think you should offer him up as a </v>

72
00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean it's a very barbaric story in</v>

73
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.800
<v Speaker 1>a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe in more than just the sense,</v>

74
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.100
<v Speaker 1>but Abraham does maintain his covenant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's willing to make the sacrifice he's </v>

75
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 1>made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to make.</v>

76
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's willing to make whatever sacrifices</v>

77
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 1>necessary to keep his covenant with God </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Tack,</v>

78
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 1>and that's that.</v>
