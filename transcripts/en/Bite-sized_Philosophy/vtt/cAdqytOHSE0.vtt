00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Heidegger thought that Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy have gone wrong basically </v>

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.421
<v Speaker 1>since the time of socrates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was quite a long time and he said </v>

3
00:00:08.421 --> 00:00:12.711
<v Speaker 1>that we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we became interested in what the world </v>

4
00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:15.441
<v Speaker 1>was made of and how we knew things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we should have been interested in </v>

5
00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:19.101
<v Speaker 1>stead was the nature and quality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being and what he meant by being isn't </v>

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.610
<v Speaker 1>the objective world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he meant by being was the manner in</v>

7
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:30.651
<v Speaker 1>which you have experience and so there </v>
<v Speaker 1>were elements of being that aren't </v>

8
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 1>objective elements and so I would say </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain is a phenomenological reality,</v>

9
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something you can.</v>

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Speaker 1>You can index it objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the index is not the phenomena and </v>

11
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is your pain real.</v>

12
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.300
<v Speaker 1>See this as this is a question for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who think there's no such thing </v>

13
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.331
<v Speaker 1>as meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you try to argue yourself out of </v>

14
00:00:56.331 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 1>pain and see how far you get.</v>

15
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

16
00:00:57.331 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>that's not the sort of meaning I meant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

17
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:01.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a negative meaning is a place to start,</v>

18
00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if something's negative and it's</v>

19
00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:08.721
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does imply that there's something </v>

20
00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:08.721
<v Speaker 1>positive that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be harder to get ahold of,</v>

21
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.760
<v Speaker 1>at least it's not pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pain descartes,</v>

22
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.760
<v Speaker 1>and I'll close with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys can have a great day.</v>

23
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Cart implemented a method he called </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical doubt when he went on his </v>

24
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:27.891
<v Speaker 1>philosophical journey and what descartes</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked for was one thing he couldn't </v>

25
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:32.421
<v Speaker 1>doubt because he was probably clinically</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed and he was just doubting </v>

26
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:32.421
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

27
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

28
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>How do I know the world isn't just been </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mirage made by an evil demon to,</v>

29
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

30
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to obfuscate reality from me.</v>

31
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.250
<v Speaker 1>While his conclusion was the one thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he could not dispute was that he </v>

32
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was an could think.</v>

33
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they cart really meant </v>

34
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.431
<v Speaker 1>what we meant by think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he meant more what we would mean</v>

35
00:01:55.531 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 1>by experience because thought has become</v>
<v Speaker 1>a much more narrowly defined,</v>

36
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>term since the time of descartes.</v>

37
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think he meant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think therefore I am.</v>

38
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I think he meant something like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced.</v>

39
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:12.580
<v Speaker 1>I have experienced therefore yama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regardless of that martyr.</v>

40
00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:15.180
<v Speaker 1>People think about it as thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>heidegger was different.</v>

41
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:20.181
<v Speaker 1>Heidegger basically said the one thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can dispute is that that experience </v>

42
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.390
<v Speaker 1>is your experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It exists.</v>

43
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost by definition,</v>

44
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the definition of exist and </v>

45
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.121
<v Speaker 1>then he was interested in what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental elements of existence I've </v>

46
00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:39.210
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This work and they're not outcomes like </v>

47
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the fundamental elements of the </v>

48
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.301
<v Speaker 1>object of world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are more things like pain and for </v>

49
00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:45.170
<v Speaker 1>me that was the thing that stopped me </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Delhi.</v>

50
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like a candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The existence of pain,</v>

51
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 1>it seems real and I might say it seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>more real than anything else.</v>

52
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say you don't believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

53
00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>but I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you think you believe,</v>

54
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll watch you when you're in pain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>every single one of your actions will </v>

55
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.360
<v Speaker 1>indicate that you believed in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

56
00:03:06.361 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>that you can't not believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

57
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>It's there and it's there so much that,</v>

58
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.810
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a meaning and so that it's in </v>

59
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.080
<v Speaker 1>that way that heidegger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in part thought of existence as</v>

60
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.170
<v Speaker 1>or experience as composed of meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so part of the reason that this </v>

61
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.430
<v Speaker 1>course is called maps of meaning is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things we're going to</v>

62
00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:31.431
<v Speaker 1>look at is the structure of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to start with negative </v>

63
00:03:31.431 --> 00:03:33.030
<v Speaker 1>meaning because from my perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

64
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.510
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can doubt whether or not good </v>

65
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.461
<v Speaker 1>exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once I'm done telling you about the </v>

66
00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:43.941
<v Speaker 1>things I know about human history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there won't be a single person in this </v>

67
00:03:43.941 --> 00:03:46.911
<v Speaker 1>room who thinks that evil doesn't exist </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might think that's a bloody </v>

68
00:03:46.911 --> 00:03:47.580
<v Speaker 1>horrible thing to learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

69
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.330
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably useful because once </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can establish something that you </v>

70
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.590
<v Speaker 1>cannot deny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can move from that.</v>

71
00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.190
<v Speaker 1>And I think you can hypothesize that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're capable of detecting radical </v>

72
00:04:03.091 --> 00:04:05.640
<v Speaker 1>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you about unit seven,</v>

73
00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:08.100
<v Speaker 1>31 at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can look them up yourself.</v>

74
00:04:08.101 --> 00:04:09.780
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't recommend it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

75
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.600
<v Speaker 1>once you can identify radical evil and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

76
00:04:14.601 --> 00:04:15.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

77
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.450
<v Speaker 1>That's just beyond a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's reprehensible.</v>

78
00:04:17.451 --> 00:04:19.670
<v Speaker 1>There's no justification for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>

79
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.890
<v Speaker 1>no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever,</v>

80
00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.280
<v Speaker 1>while then you've got something to stand</v>
<v Speaker 1>on and you can start thinking,</v>

81
00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:26.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the absolute opposite of that?</v>

82
00:04:26.931 --> 00:04:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:04:28.071 --> 00:04:33.071
<v Speaker 1>it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it that you could conduct </v>

84
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:33.071
<v Speaker 1>yourself so that in your sphere of </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>

85
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.190
<v Speaker 1>the probability like that anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would ever happen is reduced to the</v>

86
00:04:37.191 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>absolute maximum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

87
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.580
<v Speaker 1>that's a reasonable moral question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

88
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.200
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

89
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can dispense with,</v>

90
00:04:44.991 --> 00:04:49.991
<v Speaker 1>with like a casual nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a nihilist can dispense </v>

91
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:52.310
<v Speaker 1>with it because he even nihilists </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffer.</v>

92
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Thank God for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

93
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.400
<v Speaker 1>it's their only is their only source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential salvation.</v>

94
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they notice it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

95
00:05:00.231 --> 00:05:05.231
<v Speaker 1>I'm suffering about all this nihilism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that indicates that there's </v>

96
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:06.230
<v Speaker 1>something flawed in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always possible.</v>
